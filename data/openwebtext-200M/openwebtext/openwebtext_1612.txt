Hamas dismissed on Wednesday Russian pressure to release an Israeli soldier and said he will not be set free without an " honorable " prisoner exchange deal .
Russian President Dmitri Medvedev on Tuesday asked Khaled Mashaal , the exiled leader of the Palestinian Islamist movement , to quickly resolve the issue of Gilad Shalit , who was captured in 2006 by Hamas militants who tunneled into Israel from Gaza .
Shalit Debate Minister determined to toughen Palestinian prisoners ' conditions Shmulik Grossman Prime Minister Netanyahu removes his objection to new bill aimed at pressuring Hamas , but Israel Prison Service officials fear it will lead to revolt within jails .
Internal Security Minister Aharonovitch says decision will not be influenced by possible riots Minister determined to toughen Palestinian prisoners ' conditions
" Khaled Mashaal told the Russian president that we do n't want to keep Shalit but only an honorable deal will solve the issue , " Hamas politburo member Izzat al - Rishq told Reuters .
Syrian President Bashar Assad , who was hosting Medvedev in the Syrian capital , attended the meeting .
Syria hosts exiled leaders of Hamas , including Mashaal , and has influence on the group , which is also backed by Iran .
A German mediator renewed efforts in January to reach an agreement between Hamas and Israel , when the Jewish state signaled tougher terms and the process stalled .
Hamas said then that Israel was demanding that dozens of Palestinians jailed after being convicted of involvement in killings be deported upon their release .
Rishq blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failure to reach an agreement that would have involved around 1,000 out of 7,000 Palestinian prisoners being set free in exchange for Shalit .
" Netanyahu is trying to push for an empty deal .
Hamas wants the maximum number of prisoners with long sentences to be freed from Israeli occupation jails , " Rishq said .
As a right - wing leader , Netanyahu faces a particular dilemma in freeing Palestinians who might commit further violence .
But he is also under heavy public pressure to win Shalit 's release .
Medvedev 's spokeswoman Natalya Timakova said he called at the meeting with Meshaal " for a quick solution to the issue of Israeli soldier G. Shalit , so that he is freed as soon as possible . "
Hamas is shunned in the West because the group refuses to recognize Israel , and the United States considers Hamas a terrorist organization .
But Russia , a member of the Middle East peace negotiators known as the Quartet , says Hamas should not be isolated , and Moscow has kept channels open with the group .
If you are in security , you might have heard of an Intrusion Detection system , which is a device or mechanism that monitors network and / or system activities for malicious or unwanted behavior and can react , in real - time , to block or prevent those activities .
There are a lot of professional IDS available for commercial use , but when it comes to being free as freedom ( read : open source ) , Snort is my favorite .
Snort is is a very powerful tool open source IDS ( Intrusion detection system ) written by Martin Roesch & and is known to be one of the best IDS on the market even when compared to commercial IDS .
Snort performs protocol analysis , content searching / matching , and is commonly used to actively block or passively detect a variety of attacks and probes , such as buffer overflows , stealth port scans , web application attacks , SMB probes , and OS fingerprinting attempts , amongst other features .
Like Wireshark , Snort uses the libpcap library to capture packets .
Snort can be run in 4 modes :
sniffer mode : snort will read the network traffic and print them to the screen .
packet logger mode : snort will record the network traffic on a file IDS mode : network traffic matching security rules will be recorded ( mode used in our tutorial ) IPS mode : also known as snort - inline ( IPS = Intrusion prevention system )
A lot of people in the very active snort community are sharing their security rules which is very useful if you are not an security expert and wants to have up - to - date rules .
Snort can be combined with other free software such as sguil , OSSIM , and the Basic Analysis and Security Engine ( BASE ) to provide a visual representation of intrusion data .. which is in fact a PHP script displaying alerts on a web interface .
At the end of the day , Snort is a must have for any security researcher or network paranoids out there .. another mentionable IDS systems are Fragrouter , OSSEC HIDS and sGUIL .
You can download Snort from here

Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday unveiled plans to plug California ’s budget deficit by slashing billions of dollars worth of funding for services designed to help the state ’s poor .
Schwarzenegger ’s budget proposals would see spending cuts of 12.4 billion dollars and include the elimination of California ’s welfare - to - work program and virtually all child care for low income families .

“ California no longer has low - hanging fruits , ” Schwarzenegger said in Sacramento .
“ We have to take the ladder away from the tree and shake the whole tree .
We must make very difficult decisions . ”
Schwarzenegger said his spending cuts would eliminate 60 percent of funding for community mental health .
Low income families would also lose access to state - subsidized day care for children , the governor added .
“ The list goes on and on .
We ’re left with nothing but tough choices , ” Schwarzenegger said .
Schwarzenegger said the cuts were necessary to close a projected 19.1 billion dollar deficit for the fiscal year starting July 1 .
Schwarzenegger has refused to raise taxes to narrow the shortfall and described the proposed cuts to spending as “ painful ” but essential .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Everyone across the board has been hit in these last three years , ” Schwarzenegger said .
“ It is painful to make these cuts , it is painful for me and our entire team that we have to create elimination of certain programs .
“ But we are forced to do it .
And I see very clearly the faces behind those numbers .
I know how many people are suffering out there and how painful this is going to be . ”
Schwarzenegger compared the problems faced by California — which had an unemployment rate of 12.6 percent in March , well above the national figure — to current fiscal crises embroiling countries in Europe .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ You see what ’s happening in Greece , you see what ’s happening in Ireland , Spain — everyone comes to the realization that you ca n’t go spending money and promising things that you ca n’t keep , ” he said .
A budget crisis last year pushed California , which would have the world ’s eighth largest economy if it were a country , to the brink of bankruptcy , sending the state ’s credit - rating plunging and forcing it to start paying bills with IOUs .
ADVERTISEMENT
Analysts and legislators say California ’s seemingly eternal fiscal gridlock is a consequence of the state ’s constitution , which requires a two - thirds majority to pass a budget or raise taxes .
California is only one of three states to require such a margin in its legislature to pass a budget .
The University of Houston ( UH ) executed two license agreements with SuperPower , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Royal Philips Electronics .
One agreement covers the intellectual property on second generation ( 2G ) high temperature superconductor ( HTS ) wire that is developed under the Sponsored Research Agreement ( SRA ) previously executed between the two parties .
This sponsored research program is led by Venkat Selvamanickam , M.D. Anderson chair professor of mechanical engineering and the director of the Applied Research Hub of the Texas Center for Superconductivity at the University of Houston ( TCSUH ) .
The second agreement covers the fundamental composition of matter patent of high temperature superconductor that was discovered by Paul Chu in 1987 at the University of Houston .
" For the past several years we have partnered closely with the Texas Center for Superconductivity and the University of Houston on our wire development efforts .
The execution of both the Sponsored Research Portfolio License Agreement and the Chu Patent License Agreement with the university enables SuperPower to continue to advance in the development of world - class 2G HTS wire for a broad range of applications by providing rights to the basis intellectual property in the field , " said Arthur P. Kazanjian , general manager of SuperPower .
" The SRA , in particular , further binds the already strong relationship between SuperPower and the university that began when Dr. Selvamanickam joined the university in 2008 and moved from being SuperPower vice president and chief technology officer to the role of chief technology advisor . "
Gérard van Spaendonck , senior vice president and chief financial officer , Imaging Systems , Philips Healthcare , added , " the protection afforded SuperPower through these agreements will cover the ongoing SRA development work of SuperPower scientists and university students and staff that is being led by Dr. Selvamanickam .
In our drive to get the product into a state of commercial readiness , this work , which fully complements the strong base of intellectual property built by SuperPower over the past ten years , is essential to meeting demanding customer requirements . "
" The licensing agreements demonstrate the high value placed by industry on the cutting - edge research at the University of Houston , especially in the energy and medical fields , and is another indication of tier - one quality research that is being conducted by our faculty , " said University of Houston President Renu Khator .
" We are excited about the opportunity of industry commercializing high temperature superconductor materials and technology that are products of University of Houston research . "
The University of Houston and SuperPower are partners in the recently announced $ 3.5 million Emerging Technology Fund award from the state of Texas to create the Applied Research Hub of TCSUH , as well as in the recently awarded $ 10.6 million Smart Grid Fault Current Limiting Superconducting Transformer Demonstration program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy .

Boxhead Bounty Hunter
Boxhead Bounty Hunter : Violent and Charming
Sean Cooper must have been in an especially inspiring mood when he made the game Boxhead bounty hunters .
As the title suggests , the warriors have heads shaped like boxes .
Do n’t let the boxheads fool you , though .
The characters in this game are killers and they will get you .
There are weapons and equipment to choose from that will give you the different killing powers you need to accomplish your killing goals .
You have everything from a pistol to a grenade launcher to help you terrorize the neighborhood in search of bad guys .
Hint :
The bad guys are anyone who is n’t you .
For a small game , Boxhead is amazingly complex .
It ’s an online game that you can play with your friends .
You can sign up for an account .
I had a blast just shooting players I did n’t even know .
I imagine this would be even more entertaining if I was able to shoot one of my close friends or family members .
If I had to pick one word to describe Boxhead Bounty Hunters , I could n’t .
It ’s violent but charming , simple but complex , awesome but awesome .
Awesome is the one word that does n’t confus me .
All in all , I ’ll be playing this game again and thank God I had a chance to review it because now I know it exists .
I hope more individuals keep outdoing bigger companies who might have big budgets but do n’t remember just what a game is suppose to be : Fun .
No cut scenes here .
Boxhead over and out .

After a first pregnancy ended in miscarriage , the couple ’s daughter , Liliana , was born in 2002 , and for nearly two years Ms. Goldberg raised her on her own , though Mr. Lines came by two or three times a week to pitch in with changing diapers , feeding and playing with their daughter .
Eventually Ms. Goldberg and Mr. Lines decided to move in together ; had a son , Tulliver ; bought a Victorian house , and , finally , married — in a columned , open - air rotunda in a park near their home , with Ms. Goldberg wearing a maroon velour dress purchased at a thrift store and both children in attendance .

It was after Ms. Jones , too , was settled into love and motherhood — now 46 , she and her husband , Phil Jones , a forensic auditor , live in a shingled early 1900s house not far from Ms. Goldberg ’s with their 5 - year - old son , Gareth — that the book idea came up .
The writers did n’t seriously discuss it , however , until Ms. Ferdinand was well on her way to a healthy pregnancy .
“ Beth and I had our kids , and we were waiting for Pam to have her happy ending , ” Ms. Goldberg said .
Ms. Ferdinand , now 44 , a former reporter for The Washington Post and The Boston Globe , lives in the Chicago area with her fiancé , Mark Thomas , a photographer and information technology professional , and their 2 1/2 - year - old daughter , Emma .
But much of the writing of the book took place while she was still living in Boston .
The authors first worked on their individual stories independently .
Then together they chopped up their accounts into alternating chapters , with Ms. Goldberg , who set in motion the chain of events with her purchase of the donor sperm , kicking things off in Chapter 1 .
After the first literary agent the writers approached with the manuscript they were calling “ The Lucky Sperm ” turned them down , they contacted another agent , Denise Shannon .
“ When I first heard about it , what popped into my head was the sisterhood of the traveling sperm , ” Ms. Shannon said in a phone interview .
After the authors streamlined their manuscript and came up with a title that did n’t have the word “ sperm ” in it , Ms. Shannon submitted “ Inconceivable Happiness ” to publishers , and within a week she had a pre-emptive deal with Little , Brown & Company “ in the mid six figures , ” according to the writers .
Little , Brown renamed the book yet again and released it last month , with an announced initial print run of 30,000 copies .
“ It is n’t just a fairy tale , ” said Judy Clain , executive editor at Little , Brown .
The company would not release sales figures , but Ms. Clain acknowledged in a phone interview that the book “ was n’t flying off the shelves ” — even after the three women appeared on the “ Today ” show to promote “ Three Wishes . ”
At one point last week it was ranked No. 27,519 on the Amazon best - seller list .
IN the early chapters , the authors recount their experiences as single women , which involved nice - but - no - spark relationships as well as creepy blind dates arranged through matchmaking sites .
At one point Ms. Jones paid a matchmaker named Zelda $ 2,000 to find her a man — and then demanded a refund .
“ One guy was a right - wing banker who rarely stepped foot outside his office except to drive his Miata around Wellesley , ” she writes , “ the other a divorced back surgeon who was so tired on our three dates that I had to resist snapping my fingers in his face . ”

Advertisement New York City police have defused an improvised car bomb parked in Times Square , one of the city 's busiest tourist areas .
They say propane tanks , fireworks , petrol and a clock device were removed from a parked sports utility vehicle .
So far , there is no evidence that it was more than a " one - off event " , the US homeland security chief said .
Forensic evidence including fingerprints had been recovered , Janet Napolitano told NBC television .
" We 're treating it as if it could be a potential terrorist attack , " she said .
Early on Sunday the vehicle was towed to a forensic lab in the city 's Queens district and Times Square was reopened .
Part of the district - where many theatres are sited - had been sealed off on Saturday night after the bomb alert .
Both US President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the quick response by the New York Police Department .
AT THE SCENE By Ian Sherwood in New York
Thousands of tourists were evacuated from the area after a T - shirt vendor alerted the police when he spotted smoke coming from a Nissan Pathfinder .
Heavily armed police and emergency vehicles then shut down many of the busiest streets in Manhattan , which were filled with theatregoers in the heart of Broadway .
Many who had gathered on 43rd Street and Broadway were shocked to hear that the iconic Times Square had been sealed off due to a suspected car bomb .
Theatregoers reported that police officers had come onto the stage during and after some of the Broadway shows to ask the audience if they had any information about the vehicle .
" We are very lucky , " Mr Bloomberg told reporters .
" Thanks to alert New Yorkers and professional police officers , we avoided what could have been a very deadly event . "
He said the bomb " looked amateurish " but could have exploded , adding that the incident was a " reminder of the dangers that we face " .
Correspondents say the New York City Police Department is on constant alert after a series of alleged terror plots in the wake of the 9/11 attacks .
" The NYPD bomb squad has rendered safe an improvised car bomb , " said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly .
" I think the intent was to cause a significant ball of fire , " he added .
The alert was triggered when a street vendor saw smoke coming from a Nissan Pathfinder parked on 45th Street and Seventh Avenue at about 1830 ( 2230 GMT ) on Saturday .
The vehicle had its engine running and hazard lights flashing , officials said .
Police shut down several blocks of Times Square , as well as subway lines , while a robotic arm broke windows of the vehicle .
" There were explosive elements , including powder , gasoline , propane and some kind of electrical wires attached to a clock , " police spokesman Paul Browne told reporters early on Sunday .
" No motive has been identified , " he added .
A metal box resembling a gun locker was also recovered , police say .
Show goes on Security footage is being reviewed after reports that a person had been seen running away from the vehicle .
Police have established that the car 's registration plates do not match up with the Nissan .
They belonged to a car owner in the state of Connecticut , who told officers he had sent the plates to a junkyard .
There is talk about moving us to another hotel but I am not sure how this is going to happen
Jerry Brown
Tourist
In pictures : Bomb alert ' Crossroads of the world ' Evacuation eyewitnesses Most Broadway shows went ahead despite the alert .
Jerry Brown , one of the tourists evacuated from the nearby Marriott Marquis hotel , told the BBC : " Guests are sitting on the street and there is considerable chaos ...
There is talk about moving us to another hotel but I am not sure how this is going to happen . "
FBI agents joined NYPD investigators at the scene .
The White House said President Obama was being kept up to date on the investigation .
On everyone 's mind is the city 's darkest day , the 2001 attack on the Twin Towers just a few miles away , says the BBC's Barbara Plett in New York .
The most recent terror alert in New York City involved a plot to set off suicide bombs in the subway system .
Earlier this year an Afghan immigrant , Najibullah Zazi , and an associate , Zarein Ahmedzay , both pleaded guilty in connection with the attempt .
Last year four New Yorkers went on trial accused of plotting to bomb synagogues in the city and fire missiles at military aircraft .

Guillermo Del Toro departs “ The Hobbit ”
at 5:24 pm by - May 30 , 20105:24 pm by xoanon
Guillermo Del
Toro announced today that he is no longer directing the two movies based on J.R.R Tolkien ’s “ The Hobbit ” , but will continue to co-write the screenplays .
Out of respect to the legions of loyal Tolkien fans , both Guillermo and Peter Jackson wanted to break the news to The One Ring first .
They are both committed to protecting The Hobbit and will do everything in their power to ensure the films are everything that the fans want them to be .
“ In light of ongoing delays in the setting of a start date for filming “ The Hobbit , ” I am faced with the hardest decision of my life ” , says Guillermo .
“ After nearly two years of living , breathing and designing a world as rich as Tolkien ’s Middle Earth , I must , with great regret , take leave from helming these wonderful pictures .
I remain grateful to Peter , Fran and Philippa Boyens , New Line and Warner Brothers and to all my crew in New Zealand .
I ’ve been privileged to work in one of the greatest countries on earth with some of the best people ever in our craft and my life will be forever changed .
The blessings have been plenty , but the mounting pressures of conflicting schedules have overwhelmed the time slot originally allocated for the project .
Both as a co-writer and as a director , I wlsh the production nothing but the very best of luck and I will be first in line to see the finished product .
I remain an ally to it and its makers , present and future , and fully support a smooth transition to a new director ” .
“ We feel very sad to see Guillermo leave the Hobbit , but he has kept us fully in the loop and we understand how the protracted development time on these two films , due to reasons beyond anyone ’s control – has compromised his commitment to other long term projects ” , says Executive Producer Peter Jackson .
“ The bottom line is that Guillermo just did n’t feel he could commit six years to living in New Zealand , exclusively making these films , when his original commitment was for three years .
Guillermo is one of the most remarkable creative spirits I ’ve ever encountered and it has been a complete joy working with him .
Guillermo ’s strong vision is engrained into the scripts and designs of these two films , which are extremely fortunate to be blessed with his creative DNA ” .
“ Guillermo is co-writing the Hobbit screenplays with Philippa Boyens , Fran Walsh and myself , and happily our writing partnership will continue for several more months , until the scripts are fine tuned and polished ” says Jackson .
“ New Line and Warner Bros will sit down with us this week , to ensure a smooth and uneventful transition , as we secure a new director for the Hobbit .
We do not anticipate any delay or disruption to ongoing pre-production work ” .
The Hobbit is planned as two motion pictures , co-produced by New Line Cinema and MGM .
They are scheduled for release in Dec 2012 and Dec 2013 .
State " keep right " laws
All states allow drivers to use the left lane ( when there is more than one in the same direction ) to pass .
Most states restrict use of the left lane by slow - moving traffic that is not passing .
The table below describes the law in effect in each state .
A few states permit use of the left lane only for passing or turning left .
These have " yes " in the " keep right " column .
Some states require drivers to move right if they are blocking traffic in the left lane .
These have " yield " in the " keep right " column .
Most states follow the Uniform Vehicle Code and require drivers to keep right if they are going slower than the normal speed of traffic ( regardless of the speed limit ; see below ) .
These are listed as " slower " .
A few states either do not require vehicles to keep right ( " no " ) , or permit vehicles moving at the speed limit to drive in the left lane regardless of traffic conditions ( " < SL " ) .
The Uniform Vehicle Code states :
Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing shall be driven in the right - hand lane then available for traffic ...
This law refers to the " normal " speed of traffic , not the " legal " speed of traffic .
The 60 MPH driver in a 55 MPH zone where everybody else is going 65 MPH must move right .
Contrast Alaska 's rule , 13 AAC 002.50 , allowing vehicles driving at the speed limit to use the left lane , and Colorado rev. stat .
42-4-1103 , prohibiting blocking the " normal and reasonable " movement of traffic .
Enforcement is inconsistent .
Toledo police used to ticket truck drivers for driving at the 60 MPH speed limit in the left lane .
Police looking for criminal activity frequently use the " keep right " law as a pretext to stop a suspicious car .
On the other hand , a New York judge announced that he would not convict drivers for blocking speeding traffic , People v. Ilieveski , 175 Misc. 2d 943 ; 670 N.Y.S.2d 1004 ( Monroe County N.Y. 1998 ) .

Magic ' Pixie Dust ' made from pig bladders helps ' regrow ' limbs of wounded soldiers
A powder nick - named " Pixie Dust " is being used to save the limbs of war heroes who have been wounded in Afghanistan .
Surgeons have already used the dust to save several soldiers so badly mutilated that they were at risk of amputation .
Made from pig bladders it has the ability to help the human body grow new tissue to replace large areas of a leg or arm destroyed by blast damage .
Soldiers from the 1st Battalion the Coldstream Guards and the Afghan National Army patrol Helmand .
American scientists are about to trial a new treatment that ' regrows ' human tissue and could save limbs lost in combat
Many British and American soldiers have lost limbs to roadside bombs in the bitter battle for control of Afghanistan .
Now there is hope that limbs that would have been previously amputated can be saved .
Pig bladders contain a substance called extra cellular matrix , which is made up largely of collagen .
Scientists have already used powdered pig bladders help grow replacement human bladders .
But researchers working for the American military realised the substance might also help hundreds of wounded soldiers .
Professor Steve Wolf one the US 's top plastic surgeons - is carrying out a trial in Houston , Texas on victims of the Afghan fighting and has already treated several young soldiers whose limbs were so badly damaged they were unable to walk or faced amputation .
He said : ' The word has got around about how this substance from pig bladders has got this magic ability to grow new tissue .
Then one day one of the patients used the phrase ' pixie dust ' to describe it and the name stuck
' We do n't quite know how it works which adds to its magical qualities .
We think that it attracts cells in the body that have the ability to multiply and gives them a chemical signal to make new tissue . '
Professor
Wolf said medical experts were not entirely sure how the ' pixie dust ' worked
Professor Wolf - chief of clinical trials at the American Army 's Institute for Surgical Research is just about to start a formal trial using ' pixie dust ' on bomb victims after the successful treatment of a handful of blast victims last year .
One of the first soldiers to receive the treatment was Corporal Isais Hernandez .
He was so severely wounded by a mortar round that amputation of his leg seemed likely .
Corporal Hernandez , a 25 - year - old marine , was wounded in 2008 , in an incident in which a colleague died .
He said : ' The surgery that Dr Wolf performed has been fantastic .
Within a few weeks of the operation last year I was doing things with the leg I had n't done for months .
' It was so quick that you could almost see it growing and filling the hole where I was blasted .
' Before I had the sheets made from pigs bladder put into my leg I could barely use it .
I had to crawl upstairs or take the elevator and I was either on sticks or in a wheelchair .
It was pretty much useless .
' I had only 10 per cent strength in my injured leg compared to my good leg which was one reason why they 'd wanted to amputate .
' After the operation it was up to 25 per cent .
Now my leg is back to 35 per cent strength and I 'm able to get out on my mountain bike and I can walk as far as I want .
' The Extra Cellular membrane had not only made muscle but also built nerves .
I could feel my limb tingling as the new tissues grew . '
' Professor Wolfe has said there 's a good chance I might be able to go back to active duty . '
He had a gaping , crater - like wound , in his thigh right down to the bone and doctors had no way of replacing the muscle and other tissue that had been blown away .
Professor
Wolf operated and instead of using powered bladder he used it in sheet form putting layers of it into the large wound in leg Corporal Hernandez 's leg .
Magically over a period of several weeks new tissue and muscle grew until the wound was filled .
Professor
Wolf said : ' This was an amazing result .
It was quite a sight to see the body regenerate in this way because in the past we have not been able to replace muscle and tissue once it has been lost . '
The Extra Cellular Matrix grew nerves , ordinary tissue and muscle where there had been none .
Corporal Hernandez is now able to walk on the limb - which he could n't do before surgery - and is undergoing physiotherapy to restore as much strength as possible to his limb .
A large scar covers the area where the sheets of pig bladder worked their magic .
' It was several inches deep and you could see right down to my thigh bone , ' he said .
' It has healed really well .
My army mates all joke about me being cured by pixie dust .
It is amazing stuff I think it 's a great name for something that seems to work like magic . '
Pixie dust was developed by scientists at the Centre of Regenerative Medicine in Pittsburgh and one of their successes was to grow a completely new finger tip including blood vessels tissue , skin and finger nail for a man who severed it with the propeller of a model aeroplane .
Professor
Wolf believes that pixie dust has huge potential .
He said : ' We 've seen a definite effect from using this powder in our first few patients which is why we are pressing ahead with full scale trial to see if we can get the same effect again . '
D. Steven Badylak , the institute 's deputy director is convinced that the key to regeneration is finding the switch in human bodies that tells cells to grow as they do in the womb .
He said : ' The accepted wisdom is that we 're born with what we have and that 's it .
We think we 've proved that wrong with our initial work .
' Extra Cellular Matrix is loaded with signals that instruct cells to do things , as well as serving as a structural support . '
The Pentagon is investing millions of pounds in Professor Wolf 's research in the hope that pixie dust might be able to help doctors grow new arms and legs .
He said : ' We 're some way off from that at the moment but that would our eventual aim . '
Small farmers in California who have led a national movement away from industrial agriculture face a looming crackdown on food safety that they say is geared to big corporate farms and will make it harder for them to survive .
The small growers , many of whom grow dozens of different kinds of vegetables and fruits , say the inherent benefits of their size , and their sensitivity to extra costs , are being ignored .
They are fighting to carve out a sanctuary in legislation that would bring farmers under the strict purview of the Food and Drug Administration , an agency more familiar with pharmaceuticals than food and local farms .
A bill before the Senate is riding a bipartisan groundswell created by recent outbreaks of E. coli , salmonella and other contamination in everything from fresh spinach to cookie dough .
And the small farmers face opponents in consumer groups , victims of food contamination , large growers and the Obama administration , who say no farm and no food should get a pass on safety .
An even tougher version of the legislation passed the House last summer .
Now , a behind - the - scenes battle is raging in the Senate over how to regulate small and organic growers without ruining them - and still protect consumers .
If two versions of the overhaul pass , Congress would work to merge them .
The legislation would mandate a range of programs intended to bolster food safety .
The FDA would gain greater authority to regulate how products are grown , stored , transported , inspected , traced from farm to table and recalled when needed .
Pinpointing problems
But biologically diverse and organic growers argue that the problems that have plagued the food industry lie elsewhere .
They point to the sale of bagged vegetables , cut fruit and other processed food in which vast quantities of produce from different farms are mixed , sealed in containers and shipped long distances , creating a host for harmful bacteria .
The legislation does not address what some experts suspect is the source of E. coli contamination : the large , confined animal feeding operations that are breeding grounds for E. coli and are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture , not the FDA .
" It does not take on the industrial animal industry and the abuses going on , " said Tom Willey of T&D Willey Farms in Madera , an organic grower of Mediterranean vegetables .
" The really dangerous organisms we 're dealing with out here , and trying to protect our produce and other foodstuffs from , are coming out the rear end of domestic animals . "
No one in Congress or the administration has yielded in a bureaucratic turf battle between the Department of Agriculture , which regulates meat , poultry and eggs , and the FDA , which regulates all other food .
The controversy began with the spinach E. coli outbreak near San Juan Bautista in 2006 that left four people dead , 35 people with acute kidney failure and 103 hospitalized .
The bacteria , known as E. coli O157:H7 , first appeared in hamburger meat in the early 1980s and migrated to produce , mainly lettuce and other leafy greens that are cut , mixed and bagged for the convenience of shoppers .
Contamination
Since then , there have been dozens of contamination cases , leading Congress to rewrite food safety laws by giving much more power to the FDA .
But small growers worry that they , and consumers , will suffer in the sweep of reform .
" How do we trust that the FDA is going to know about things that the San Francisco Bay Area has been very progressive on - the field to fork , fresh , grow local , buy local - all of that ? " said Rep. Sam Farr , D - Carmel .
" The organic people are feeling that the regulations the FDA may promulgate will be so safety oriented , it 'll put them out of business . "
Consumer groups say they care about small farmers but that safety comes first .
" Our principle is that food should be safe , whatever the source , " said Sandra Eskin , director of the Pew Health Group 's food safety campaign , one of the Pew Charitable Trusts , which Monday sponsored a public meeting on the issue with federal officials in Seaside ( Monterey County ) .
" People care profoundly about all these issues : feeding their families , food safety , local agriculture , " Eskin said .
" It 's a passionate discussion and understandably so .
Everybody eats . "
Tom Nassif , head of Western Growers , which represents large produce growers , said small growers should not be exempt .
" If the small guy who sells to a farmers ' market gets a family sick , it 's a blip on the radar screen , " Nassif said .
" There 's not a big hue and cry , because it did n't affect hundreds of people .
What about those people ?
Does n't their food safety count ? "
Protocols
The tension that has come with food safety reforms was on display after the spinach outbreak rocked California .
Large growers embraced costly science - based safety protocols for all leafy greens - guidelines that federal regulators are considering taking nationwide .
However , a UC Davis study last year by Shermain Hardesty and Yoko Kusunose found that the rules have put smaller growers at a disadvantage because their compliance costs are spread over fewer acres .
Hardesty said costs may be as high as $ 100 an acre .
Large produce buyers such as Wal - Mart and McDonald 's have gone much further than the industry standards .
They have imposed rules of their own that have forced many California farmers who supply them to fence off waterways , poison wildlife to keep animals out of fields and destroy crop hedgerows that support beneficial insects .
Deputy Agriculture Secretary Kathleen Merrigan said Monday the administration is keeping a " close watch " on these so - called " super metrics , " acknowledging that they have harmed the environment but said , " nobody gets a pass on food safety . "
Increasing the danger
Willey , the Madera farmer , argued that many food safety rules tend " to push us to embrace a paradigm of sterility , " which , in the long run , increases the danger .
" When you create microbial vacuums , they can be even more easily taken over by pathogenic organisms , " he said .
" In organic agriculture , we depend tremendously on a cooperative effort with beneficial microorganisms .
My whole soil fertility system is based on that .
Actually , soil fertility planetwide is based on that . "
Efforts to modify proposed rules to make compliance easier for biologically diversified farms have been more successful in the Senate than in the House .
New language that requires the FDA to consider farm size , crop diversity , organic requirements and other issues has been added .
" While none of these things in themselves solves the cause for concern , they certainly point strongly in the direction of the FDA needing to take into account these considerations , " said Ferd Hoefner , policy director for the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition .
Hoefner called the House bill a one - size - fits - all approach that would be a " complete disaster " for small farms .

The Gerontology Research Group mailing list is presently hosting a healthy discussion on the question of whether or not aging is a disease - no doubt touched off by this article in the UK press :
" If aging is seen as a disease , it changes how we respond to it .
For example , it becomes the duty of doctors to treat it , " said David Gems , a biogerontologist who spoke at a conference on aging in London last week called " Turning Back the Clock . "
At the moment , drug companies and scientists keen to develop their research on aging into tangible results are hampered by regulators in the United States and Europe who will license medicines only for specific diseases , not for something as general as aging .
" Because aging is not viewed as a disease , the whole process of bringing drugs to market can't be applied to drugs that treat aging .
This creates a disincentive to pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs to treat it , " said Gems .
As you might already know , whether or not aging is called a disease has very little to do with words and definitions , and a great deal to do with money and regulation .
Unelected officials of organizations like the FDA in the United States cause untold harm to progress in medical science by ( a ) placing huge and unnecessary burdens upon research and development , and ( b ) forbidding outright commercial application for any purpose or disease that is not in their list .
It can take a decade - and millions of dollars in the formalized bribery known as lobbying - for a new discovery , new classification , or new form of therapy to be recognized by regulators .
Or even longer , as is the case for aging .
A world without the FDA would be a far better place , in which progress was faster and the breadth of medical development far greater .
The death toll of those who wait in vain for new and more effective therapies would be greatly reduced , and the engines of free market competition turned to building new medical miracles .
But sadly we do not live in that world - it lies somewhere beyond the next revolution , or perhaps beyond the next great open frontier .
High - Tech Headstones Let You Speak From Beyond the Grave Radio Frequency ID tags store your information on your headstone .
March 12 , 2010  --
After he dies , Christopher Hill plans to speak to his grandchildren , great grandchildren and even future generations from beyond the grave – not through a psychic medium or his last will and testament , but through a microchip .
" I think that when you walk by a gravestone and only see things like a few words , or a name and a date , it can be somewhat cold , impersonal , and almost incomplete , " the 41 - year - old from Northern Virginia told ABCNews.com .
" This gravestone is supposed to tell the story of a person , and provide you that connection or emotional remembrance . "
With new technology developed by a Phoenix , Ariz .
company , he now thinks that could be a real possibility .
Launched by Objecs , LLC last month , Personal RosettaStones are iPod- sized stone tablets embedded with RFID ( Radio Frequency Identification ) tags that can store up to 1,000 words and a picture .
When they 're near a mobile phone equipped with compatible technology , the information in the microchip is beamed right on to the cell phone screen .
Objecs says the tags , which can be affixed to headstones , can last for up to 3,200 years .
Hill , a financial advisor and founder of a funeral resources Web site , was an early supporter of the product and among the first to buy one .
RosettaStone Could Give Future Generations More Insight Into Family History
With it , he said , future generations would be able to visit his burial site and see more than his name and dates etched in a stark , grey tablet .
They 'll be able to read about where he lived and what he loved to do and how he lived his life .
" I literally can speak to people forever , I can be seen forever , " he said .
" I can always have something my kids can see and touch . "
As the funeral industry continues to become more technologically sophisticated , with funeral webcasts , memorial Web sites and tribute DVDs , he said the RosettaStone could appeal to families looking for a new way to remember loved ones .
Since news about the RosettaStones broke , Objecs says the company has been flooded with inquiries – too many , in fact , for the small company to keep up with .
" It 's been overwhelming , " said John Bottorff , the company 's founder .
But he acknowledged that given the very high - tech nature of the product , many of the inquiries have come from members of the tech community curious about how an advanced wireless communication standard is being applied .
Near Field Communication Tech Could Extend to Cash Machines , Billboards and More
The RosettaStones only communicate with phones equipped with near field communication ( NFC ) technology .
The short - range communication technology allows information to pass wirelessly between two devices that are within inches of each other .
The industry says that vending machines , cash machines , billboards and street signs could all become NFC - enabled .
Though it is n't prevalent in the U.S. , Bottorff expects that it will migrate to the U.S. soon .
At the moment , the standard has generated more interested in Europe and Japan , he said , adding that many of the RosettaStone inquiries have been from those parts of the world .
" We have a technology in place , right now , " he said .
" But it 's sort of like building a road and there 's not a shopping mall out there yet . "
But he expects the shopping mall to come .
Borttoff said the idea for the stones was born of both professional and personal events .
His company specializes in " object hyperlinking , " or the use mobile devices to access information about the objects around them .
Using RFID technology , barcodes and other kinds of systems , people can use their cell phone to access information on ads , tourist sites , consumer products and more .
Around the same time that he was approached by a client to create a way to tag historic grave sites , his family lost several loved ones .
The project requested by the client did n't continue , but he said the personal interest did .
Company Treats Information as ' Genealogical Archive '
" I think that it was seeing that our relatives , I guess , were being memorialized with information etched in a granite headstone and , at the time , both my wife and I looked at this and it just seemed so thin , " he said .
" These people are certainly a lot more than a name and a birth date and a deceased date . "
While memorial Web sites provide a way for people to share and store information about deceased loved ones , he said , unlike his product , they 're not interested in long - term data survival .
" Our data files , we treat them as a genealogical archive , " he said .
" This is about a public record . "
Each RosettaStone client is assigned a unique number and all of his personal information is stored in a central database , Borttoff explained .
This system simplifies the task for the person 100 years in the future trying to piece together her family tree or the historian collecting artifacts of communities long - gone .
" This is an action that is more for society , humanity in a longer sense , " he said .
Will People Pay for Added Expense ?
For about $ 200 , Bottorff said , customers can choose either granite tablets ( which he says will last for 3,200 years ) or ones made of travertine ( which last for about 300 years ) .
Then , from a menu of hundreds , they can choose six icons to be engraved on the stones that communicate the person 's interests and values .
A map , for example , could indicate the person 's hometown , the scales of justice or an ambulance could represent his occupation .
" Our message is you do n't have to be a rule maker or a king to have a RosettaStone , " he said .
" It 's for anybody who is a common citizen of the world . "
But some in the funeral industry doubt that the technology will take off .
Bonnie McCullough , executive director of the N.Y. State Funeral Directors Association , said that though the memorial industry is becoming more technologically - involved , families arranging the funerals of loved ones might not be willing to absorb the added expense of this kind of technology .
While webcasts for funerals and memorial Web sites let loved ones share memories and support those in grief , she said , RosettaStone 's technology seemed more interested in creating a public record for future generations .
" We 're in a little bit of a challenging economy , " she said .
" Families may be more worried about today 's finances than historical information seekers one hundred years from now . "
Younger Generations May Remember Deceased Relatives Differently
But others say that as younger , more tech - savvy generations become the ones responsible for funeral arrangements , products such as RosettaStone may appeal more widely to families .
Younger generations are already showing more interest in green funerals , video memorials and other non-traditional arrangements , James Olson , a spokesman for the National Funeral Directors Association , told ABCNews.com .
Accustomed to recording and sharing their lives with technology , he expects them to bring a different mentality to memorializing a loved one .
" As the baby boomer generation starts to pass , we 'll see more and more of this technology , " he said .
" [ Children of baby boomers ] are more technologically - involved and they 're going to want these things for their parents . "
Some bloggers are trying to read the tea leaves on Elena Kagan and how she would rule on technology cases if she makes it to the Supreme Court .
Nothing is certain , but Kagan may prove to be an opponent of corporate Hollywood on fair use while also defending Internet service providers in the net neutrality debate .
Hollywood should be nervous by Kagan 's stance , argues The Hollywood Reporter 's Eriq Gardner .
Evidence is limited but her role last year in a copyright case is telling , he argues .
In 2006 , Cablevision announced plans to offer customers a remote TiVo - like service and was promptly sued by Hollywood movie studios , which feared the loss of on - demand licensing fees .
Hollywood eventually lost and appealed to the Supreme Court .
Solicitor General Kagan succeeded in urging the Court not to review the case last June and she chastised Cablevision for not making fair use a bigger issue .
That , Gardner argued , was a sign that Kagan will side with civil liberties advocates :
[ It ] should cheer those on the copy - left at the EFF and worry many in the entertainment industry .
If this is what our new Solicitor General thinks the Supreme Court should be considering , the industry should be watching her closely .
But Gardner 's conclusive interpretation is n't shared by all .
TMCnet 's Ed Silverstein reports that Kagan 's stance is far from clear according to Todd Dickinson , the head of the 16,000 - member American Intellectual Property Law Association .
And Dan Farber , a professor at the University of California - Berkeley Law School , agreed : " So far as I know , she 's never taken a public position about an IP issue . "
On net neutrality , Kagan may end up siding with internet service providers , argues University of Nebraska - Lincoln Law Professor Marvin Ammori .
In the 1990 's cable companies tried to fight a law promoting diverse speakers on cable by calling it a burden on their free speech rights to pick and choose the channels subscribers receive .
In a 1996 piece that Ammori calls " one of Kagan 's few major articles , " she sided with them .
While the evidence is n't decisive , she may agree with ISPs who similarly argue that it's their First Amendment right to restrict access to websites and technologies on the web .

Until last week , I had never experienced what must have been incredibly frustrating to most developers : the fact that the self keyword in PHP refers to the class it is located in , and not necessarily a class that extends it .
I personally ran into this problem when trying to extend Zend_Auth .
Being a singleton , the constructor in Zend_Auth is protected , and the static method Zend_Auth : : getInstance ( ) instantiates itself .
The problem is , when extended , My_Auth : : getInstance ( ) still returns an instance of Zend_Auth .
The solution was to duplicate the static method in my My_Auth class , which worked properly .
For example :
<? php < span id =" more - 1264 " ></ span > class My_Auth extends Zend_Auth {} echo get_class ( My_Auth::getInstance ( ) ) ;
What did I get as a return value ?
Zend_Auth – because here is the source code of the getInstance ( ) method in Zend Framework ’s Zend_Auth class :
/** * Returns an instance of Zend_Auth * * Singleton pattern implementation * * @return Zend_Auth Provides a fluent interface */ public static function getInstance ( ) { if ( null === self : : $ _instance ) { self : : $ _instance = new self ( ) ; } return self : :$ _instance ; }
Why did n’t I get an instance of My_Auth instead of Zend_Auth ?
Well , that ’s because PHP determines the meaning of the self keyword at compile time , meaning that when you call a function that makes use of it later , you ’ll get whatever it ’s been defined to mean when it was compiled .
PHP 5.3 provides a workaround for this , called late static binding .
Simply put , PHP 5.3 introduces a new use of the keyword static , that allows you to avoid this define - at - compile - time problem .
Using PHP 5.3 with the same example , and the static keyword , here is what happens .
// Auth.php rewritten /** * Returns an instance of Zend_Auth * * Singleton pattern implementation * * @return Zend_Auth Provides a fluent interface */ public static function getInstance ( ) { if ( null === static : : $ _instance ) { static : : $ _instance = new static ( ) ; } return static : :$ _instance ; } // My Auth class and sample code class My_Auth extends Zend_Auth {} echo get_class ( My_Auth:: getInstance ( ) ) ;
The result here is now that an instance of My_Auth is returned .
Late static bindings make working with static methods much easier .
For this feature alone I believe PHP 5.3 is a worthwhile upgrade .

Courtesy of Economic Policy Journal we now know that the majority of American states are currently insolvent , and that the US Treasury has been conducting a shadow bailout of at least 32 US states .
Over 60 % of Americans receiving state unemployment benefits are getting these directly from the US government , as 32 states have now borrowed $ 37.8 billion from Uncle Sam to fund unemployment insurance .
The states in most dire condition , are , not unexpectedly , the unholy trifecta of California ( $ 6.9 billion borrowed ) , Michigan ( $ 3.9 billion ) , and New York ( $ 3.2 billion ) .
With this form of shadow bailout occurring , one can only wonder how many other shadow programs are currently in operation to fund states under the table with federal money .
The full list of America 's 32 insolvent states is below , sorted in order of bankruptedness .

Meg Whitman , the billionaire Republican candidate for governor , has plunged in polls as rapidly as she once ascended , dropping from a 50 - point lead in March to single digits in a poll released Wednesday .
Whitman ’s rise earlier this year relied largely on a single overwhelming factor -- a personal fortune she has tapped for $ 68 million so far , allowing her to flood the airwaves for months .
But her decline stems from a host of factors , according to political analysts and strategists .
Her opponent Steve Poizner ’s attack on her as being too liberal on illegal immigration lacked traction for weeks , then found footing with the passage of a tough new Arizona law that Whitman opposed .
The business background that was an early advantage for the former EBay chief turned into a liability with publicity about her ties to a controversial Wall Street firm .
Advertisement
Attacks from both the right , via Poizner , and the left , from Democrats , left Whitman whipsawed .
Anti-establishment voters may have taken their angst out on a high - flying frontrunner .
The result : According to a new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California , Whitman ’s once - massive lead over state Insurance Commissioner Poizner has dwindled to nine points , 38 % to 29 % .
Whitman ’s support dropped 23 points in two months , the survey showed , while Poizner gained 18 points .
Democrat Jerry Brown now narrowly leads Whitman in a general election matchup , a reversal of their standing in March .
With less than three weeks to go before the June 8 primary , the battle between the two free - spending Republican rivals rests on colliding imperatives : Whitman ’s is to arrest her slide , and Poizner ’s is to find the path past her that has eluded him thus far .
Almost a third of voters in the new poll said they were undecided , a signature of the race ’s continuing volatility .
“ What this suggests is that overall both candidates still have a lot to prove to the core conservative Republican voter , ” said institute President Mark Baldassare .

What helped bring Whitman to earth , he said , was what vaulted her skyward : money .
Except in this case it was Poizner ’s money -- the $ 24 million he has put into his campaign .
“ Steve Poizner had the resources to tell people that there was an alternative , ” Baldassare said .
“ And once people thought there was an alternative , and particularly a conservative alternative , that created a lot of uncertainty about who was going to be in the best position to send a loud and stern message , which voters seem to want to do this year . ”
Whitman ’s precipitous fall may look worse than it actually was .
Races often tighten as election day nears and more voters begin to pay attention .
Whitman ’s campaign had predicted closure and remains publicly confident that she will be the nominee .
“ We ’ve always expected that this would be a tighter race , ” Whitman spokeswoman Sarah Pompei said last week .
Moreover , at the time the institute ’s March poll showed her lead at 50 points , Whitman had had the airwaves to herself for more than a month , inflating her advantage in a state where so much political information comes through the television .

“ Nobody else had positioned themselves as a candidate for governor , so the only choice people thought they had was Meg Whitman , ” said Darry Sragow , a lawyer and Democratic strategist .
“ The numbers were not going to be sustained . ”
The institute ’s latest poll did not seek to determine why Whitman ’s numbers have dropped , but those watching the race suggest a confluence of events :
Poizner ’s campaign began its television ads toward the end of March , casting Whitman as being too liberal on immigration , among other criticisms .
The first intimations of Whitman ’s drop came in a Capitol Weekly poll taken in the middle of April that put her lead over Poizner at 28 points , still a landslide .
Then , on April 16 , federal regulators accused Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs of fraud for its handling of tainted mortgage investments .
The issue reached into the governor ’s race because Whitman had a long and continuing relationship with Goldman .
During her tenure at EBay , she had been sued by stockholders who said she had given EBay ’s banking business to Goldman in exchange for beneficial stock offerings .
The suit was settled when Whitman returned almost $ 2 million in profits .

One week later , Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed the nation ’s toughest law against illegal immigration , igniting a national dispute that resonated among conservatives who form the bulk of the Republican primary electorate .
When Whitman opposed the bill , Poizner again hammered her in television ads .
He and Democrats also aired ads critical of her Goldman ties .
The institute ’s latest poll shows that Whitman has declined across the board since March .
Among non-college graduates , her support fell 29 points ; among those making $ 80,000 per year and more , she dropped 28 points .
She fell 20 points among men and 25 points among women .
Whitman ’s latest statewide ad showed a candidate on the defensive :
One by one she ticked off charges leveled by Poizner .
She said she strongly opposed Barbara Boxer , the Democratic senator he criticized her for supporting in the past ; she declared she would oppose “ amnesty ” for illegal immigrants , a response to a Poizner ad that showed film of her suggesting otherwise .
Whitman continues to hold advantages .
Her campaign , unlike his , is flooding voters with mailers and phone calls .
More troublesome for Poizner , strategists said , is that his campaign ’s unrelenting criticism of Whitman has hurt her without giving Californians a positive view of him .
Former Republican strategist Allan Hoffenblum noted that in many recent polls , former Whitman voters have gone not into Poizner ’s camp , but into the undecided column .

“ Poizner has not really defined who he is , ” said Hoffenblum , who publishes the California Target Book , a nonpartisan analysis of races in the state .
“ I still think Meg is in the driver ’s seat , but it ’s a race . ”

What caused the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon ?
By Tom Eley
14 May 2010
The explosion on the oil rig Deepwater Horizon | Source : http://offshoreinjuries.com
As more details emerge about the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon , which killed 11 workers and spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , it has become clear that the single - minded drive for profit and a total lack of regulation created the disaster .
In the immediate aftermath of the explosion , oil giant BP , rig operator Transocean and the Obama administration all took the position that the disaster was an unforeseeable event .
Interviews with workers , information gathered by researchers and testimony given to Congressional and Coast Guard hearings prove , however , that there was in fact ample warning that a disaster was possible , even likely .
But BP and its partners , Transocean and Halliburton , disregarded these warnings .
They could do so with impunity .
There exists no regulatory body in the oil industry to defend the safety interests of workers and the environment , the Mineral Management Service ( MMS ) of the Department of the Interior having long ago ceded all meaningful regulatory control to the industry itself .
Buildup to disaster
Evidence revealed in Congressional testimony , press accounts and gathered by University of California professor Robert Bea has provided a detailed picture of the weeks and hours leading up to the explosion .
Deepwater Horizon was not an extractive oil rig , but an exploratory rig .
When it exploded on April 20 it was in the process of completing its exploration by capping the well it had bored some three miles below the ocean floor , before moving on to another exploration site .
This required the rig to plug the oil well and separate its riser piping from the wellhead to the rig .
A separate rig would later have come to access the sealed wellhead .
Deepwater Horizon ’s exploratory drilling had been troubled by unusually frequent and forceful contact with explosive natural gas deposits , known in the industry as “ kicks , ” workers say .
Only weeks before the fatal explosion , so much gas forced its way up the well bore and onto the rig platform that an emergency freeze was placed on many activities aboard the rig in order to avoid triggering an explosion .
According to one worker ’s account , submitted to Bea , “ at one point during the previous several weeks , so much [ gas ] came belching up to the surface that a loudspeaker announcement called for a halt to all ‘ hot work , ’ meaning any smoking , welding , cooking or any other use of fire .
Smaller belches , or ‘ kicks , ’ had stalled work as the job was winding down . ”
“ As the job unfolded ... the workers did have intermittent trouble with pockets of natural gas , ” another rig employee reported to Bea .
“ Highly flammable , the gas was forcing its way up the drill pipes .
This was something BP had not foreseen as a serious problem , declaring a year earlier that gas was likely to pose only a ‘ negligible ’ risk .
The government warned the company that gas buildup was a real concern and that BP should ‘ exercise caution . ’ ”
The day of the explosion , engineers reportedly argued over whether or not to remove dense drilling mud from the well bore , replacing it with much lighter sea water .
Normally this step is taken only after a second cement plug is hardened in the piping , a process that takes several hours .
Until this plug is fully installed , heavy mud is the first line of defense against kicks and “ blowouts , ” when oil and natural gas surge up the bore to the rig platform .
The decision was taken to replace the mud before plugging the well , even though this would increase the chances of an explosion — and even though the operation failed a critical pressure test the same day , BP and Transocean executives admitted to the House Energy Committee .
This clearly reckless decision to press forward was very likely done to protect BP ’s profit interests , both because it paid rig owner Transocean an estimated $ 500,000 per day for use of Deepwater Horizon and its crew , and because it was anxious to bring the new well into active production .
A worker told the Wall Street Journal that the crew was in fact preparing to drop the cement plug down the riser — standard procedure — when the order came to instead pump out the mud .
“ Usually we set the cement plug at that point and let it set for six hours , then displace the well , ” he said .
The worker told the Journal that this dangerous step was first cleared with the MMS .
The MMS refused comment .
It is likely that this decision combined with the failure of two other lines of defense : cement outside the well bore ’s piping under the ocean floor , which is designed to prevent natural gas from moving up the bore and the riser to the rig ; and the blowout preventer , a massive piece of equipment that sits on the ocean floor and is equipped with powerful hydraulic shears whose task is to sever piping in the event of a blowout .
Halliburton , which contracted for the cement and mudding work on the rig , had deployed a new chemical cement that it said would be resistant to structural damage caused by methane hydrates , which were present in the undersea rock in high quantities .
But Bea , an expert with decades of experience in oil extraction engineering , said that when he saw the formula for Halliburton ’s cement , he said “ Uh oh . ”
Bea told the Times - Picayune that Halliburton had produced “ many excellent papers ” that claim “ because of the chemicals they ’ve added , they think the cement can cure rapidly . ”
But Bea explained that the same chemicals they added likely gave off too much heat , thus thawing gases lodged in the rocks from their methane hydrate form and sending them up the bore and riser .
When the cement failed , gas began to force its way up the riser .
At this point , concrete well plugs in the pipe should have blocked the gas .
But contrary to normal practice , the final plug had not been installed , and the salt water was not heavy enough to stop the high pressure gas from rising .
On the evening of April 20 , a geyser of seawater erupted onto the rig , shooting 240 feet into the air .
This was soon followed by the eruption of a slushy combination of mud , gas and water .
At this point workers knew they were in danger because the mud could only have come from 10,000 feet down , Bea said .
On the rig , the gas component of the slushy material quickly transitioned into a fully gaseous state and then ignited into a series of explosions and then a firestorm .
Workers immediately attempted to activate the blowout preventer , but it too failed .
Ironically , at the moment of the explosion a number of BP officials , recently helicoptered to the rig , had gathered for a celebration with rig staff marking seven years of a “ spotless ” safety record .
Those at the party were thrown violently to the floor by the force of the explosion .
Bea , who headed up an independent team of scientists that investigated failure of levees during Hurricane Katrina , compared the two events .
“ BP fell into the same damn trap , and they were not engineering ; they were ‘ imagineering , ’ ” he told the Times - Picayune .
“ Risk analysis continues to mislead us because we ’re only looking at part of the risk .
The same trail of tears led to Katrina , to the Massey Big Branch ( coal ) mine disaster , and it ’s showing up here again . ”
“ For me , the tragedy of Katrina was floating bodies and the homes and businesses that were destroyed , ” Bea said .
“ This time , it ’s different .
Certainly the people on the rig were killed and the pieces of equipment were destroyed , but like Katrina , there ’s another non-voting population getting hurt this time and it is those marine animals that are our equivalents . ”
A collapse in regulation
The series of mechanical failures and human errors that conspired to produce the disaster aboard the Deepwater Horizon were not random accidents , as the Obama administration and much of the media seek to portray them .
They arose from the deregulation of the oil industry that has advanced for decades under both Republican and Democratic administrations .
These conditions made a major spill inevitable — if not on the Deepwater Horizon , then on some other rig .
Indeed , thousands of oil rigs operating under precisely the same regulatory environment that produced the Deepwater Horizon disaster continue to extract oil even today .
The Deepwater Horizon , it has become clear , was operated in the total absence of real government regulation .
This is most evident in relationship to the rig ’s blowout preventer , its final line of defense .
At hearings in Louisiana held by the MMS and the US Coast Guard , the head of MMS ’s Louisiana engineering operations , Frank Patton , who had given BP authorization to begin drilling at the Deepwater Horizon site , admitted that he had performed no inquiry and had been given no assurance that the rig ’s blowout preventer would function in the event of a spill .
He also admitted that he had certified “ hundreds ” of oil rigs without verifying the efficacy of their blowout preventers .
These rigs presumably continue to operate in Gulf waters — a handful in deeper water than the Deepwater Horizon .
At House Energy Committee hearings held Wednesday , the head of Transocean , Steven Newman , confirmed that one of the Deepwater Horizon ’s shear rams , devices used in blowout preventers to sever pipes , was altered in 2005 at the request of BP and with the approval of the MMS .
It was modified for testing , but in the process was likely rendered useless for a real emergency .
The MMS was also aware years ago that shear rams are likely to fail in emergencies , even when functional .
A 2002 study by Per Holand , a Norwegian engineer , found that shear rams are not powerful enough to cut through joints in piping , which account for about 10 percent of total surface area in a blowout preventer ’s piping .
None of Holand ’s resulting proposals were acted upon .
Another 2002 study conducted by the MMS revealed that in laboratory testing of one manufacturer ’s shear rams half failed .
Seven other makers refused to have their shear rams tested .
Yet another report commissioned by the MMS in 2004 questioned whether shear rams could even function under immense oceanic pressures such as those experienced by the Deepwater Horizon .
The devices were literally untested in deep sea conditions .
The study authors called this a “ grim snapshot of the lack of preparedness in the industry to shear and seal a well with the last line of defense against a blowout ” in deep water .
In spite of the study , no standards were put in place .
In a 2000 safety alert the MMS “ urged ” deep sea oil rigs to include a backup device used to activate blowout preventers in the event of an explosion .
The device , known as a “ deadman , ” was included on the Deepwater Horizon .
But , according to testimony given to the House Energy Committee , the device ’s battery was likely dead .
The MMS , it has been revealed , does not inspect — let alone enforce — the use of blowout preventers .
Other oil producing nations , including Norway , Canada and Brazil , require a second backup device that can be activated by sound .
It is not required on US rigs .
It has also been revealed that the number of drill site inspections carried out by the MMS dropped by over 40 percent between 2005 and 2009 , even as the number of drill rigs operating in US waters rapidly increased .
Penalties issued by MMS for regulatory violations fell from 66 in 2000 to 20 last year .
By all accounts , regulation depends almost entirely on industry “ self - enforcement . ”
The gutting of regulation continued into the Obama administration .
Under Obama , the MMS intervened in a court case last summer to allow BP to proceed with exploration and extraction at its Deepwater Horizon site without submitting a legally required environmental impact study .
Obama promoted a vast expansion of offshore and deep sea drilling , declaring the industry to be safe , without having addressed any of the outstanding safety issues .
Yet , like the more immediate causes of the explosion and sinking on the Deepwater Horizon , none of these regulatory decisions were mere “ mistakes . ”
Regulation in the oil industry — as in every other US industry , including the financial system — has been reduced to its present state by a series of conscious political decisions enacted at every level of government by both Republicans and Democrats .
This political shift , in turn , has arisen from the demands of the US corporate and financial elite , who have sought to dismantle every obstacle to their personal enrichment — regardless the costs for their workers and the health of the planet .
The child abuse scandal rocking the Vatican grew yet again Wednesday when former children in a German orphanage submitted written statements that a German bishop habitually beat them .
The Bishop of Augsburg , Walter Mixa , was a controversial conservative churchman appointed by Pope Benedict in 2005 and has been called his friend .
According to the statement , Mixa used to hit and degrade the children repeatedly during sessions of punishment at the Catholic orphanage .
Among other details , Mixa is accused of using a carpet beater on the bare behinds of victims as he screamed : ‘ Satan is in you and I must drive him out . ’
ADVERTISEMENT
A controversial figure in the Catholic church , Mixa previously explained that the liberation movement deserved a ‘ significant ’ part of the blame for pedophilia scandals in the church .
Hildegard Sedlmair , now 48 , said she was beaten by the German bishop when she was 15 .
“ I was really upset when the pope appointed him Bishop because he was much lower in rank then and does n’t deserve to be where he is because of what he put us through , ” she said .
“ He grabbed me by my smock , hauled me out of bed and beat me on the upper arms until they were black and blue . ”
She said the time spent at the orphanage ‘ was the worst of my life ’ .
A man who did n’t identify himself told Germany ’s Sueddeutsche newspaper : ‘ A minimum of 50 times in one year he made me drop my trousers and beat me on my behind with a carpet beater or a stick , really , really hard . ’
He was allegedly at the home between 1972 to 1982 .

According to the statements , it was n’t just Bishop Mixa who dished plenty of corporal punishment .
The nuns also hit the children with ‘ wooden brooms , wooden shoes , and clothing hangers , ’ the statement said .
Mixa was friendly with then Cardinal Ratzinger in Germany years ago .
He is now part of a conservative group that backed several of the PopeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s more controversial decisions .
A spokeswoman for the Bishopric of Augsburg said the statements were “ absurd . ”

“ At no time and in none of his functions has Bishop Mixa ever maltreated children .
[ These allegations ] are absurd , untrue , and evidently concocted with the aim of personally discrediting the bishop , ” said spokeswoman Kathi Marie Ulrich .
Is this Kim Jong - il 's mysterious heir ?
' First photograph ' of the man tipped to become North Korea 's leader
A Japanese newspaper has published a photo of a man it claims is the youngest son and rarely seen successor to North Korea 's ailing leader Kim Jong -il .
The photograph shows a well - dressed man standing alongside the leader during a visit to a steel factory in the country 's north east , and has prompted intense speculation about the future of the Asia 's final Communist dynasty .
If the claims made in the Rodong Sinmun newspaper are correct , the photo represents the first time Jong - un has been seen as an adult .
Heir - apparent : A man believed to be Kim Jong - il 's son , far left , stands alongside the North Korean leader during a visit to a steel factory
It comes amid reports the 67 - year - old ' Dear Leader ' has been trying to introduce his son as his successor for months and asked the country 's main bodies to pledge loyalty to him .
A great deal of mystery surrounds the 26 - year - old , but North Korea 's state - run media has been slowly raising his profile after his older brothers were said to have fallen out of favour with their father .
Uncertainty surrounds Jong - il 's future , as his health is said to be worsening following a stroke in 2008 .
He also suffers from diabetes and kidney and heart disease .
Jong - Un is the second son of Jong - il 's third wife , Ko Yong - Hee .
Born in 1983 , he is believed to have attended an international school in Switzerland under a pseudonym .
His appearance is set to spark debate questions about the country 's leadership amid reports it is preparing a third nuclear test .
Experts claim Jong - un will remain weak , vulnerable and at the mercy of the North 's old guard for years , experts have said .
North Korea places great emphasis on seniority and the ruling elite around Kim Jong - il , mostly men beyond 70 , are not about to take orders from the son , sources claim .
Last month it was claimed that Kim 's sister has also been brought back to the forefront of power as he attempts to shore up the family regime .
After six years out of the public spotlight , Kim Kyong - Hui , 64 , was added to a diagram of the North 's power structure released by the South 's unification ministry .
The diagram showed her overseeing light industries under the ruling Workers ' Party of Korea .
Kyong - Hui's husband Jang Song - Thaek has strengthened his image as the leader 's right - hand man amid speculation he will play the role of regent as the leader grooms Jong - Un , to take over .
Kim Jong-il is relying on his family more and more to exercise power , intelligence officials believe .
Kenji Fujimoto , a former personal chef to Kim Jong - il , has described the son as ' a chip off the old block ' who closely resembles his father physically and in terms of personality .

All of us are just beginning to understand the many ways real - time information and short - form web content will be useful in the future , and we think being able to make use of historical information is an important part of that .
As for me , after some hard work on real - time search , it ’s time for a virtual vacation to relive one of my favorite moments of the Winter Games .
At the Google I/O conference , Google just held its second keynote address , which focussed on Android .
The talk was held by Vic Gundotra , and he unveiled a number of new features coming in Android 2.2 “ Froyo ” , as well as some features coming in Froyo + 1 .
The main theme of the entire keynote ?
Openness and choice , and a whole bucketload of not - so - subtle jabs at Apple .
I ’d like to apologise upfront for a possible lack of critical notes in this article – I ’m still handing out the brownie points to Google for yesterday .
State of the union
While the talk was obviously focussed entirely on the strengths of the Android platform , Gundotra took jab after jab at Apple , to much applause from the audience .
The most important difference between Google ’s Android and Apple ’s iPhone OS ?
Openness , and choice .
Gundotra explained that one of the main reasons Google started Android in the first place was to prevent a “ draconion ” future .
“ If we did not act , we faced a draconian future .
Where one man , one company , one carrier was the future , ” he stated , to much applause .

The openness and choice thing is apparently working out for Google , since Android use is way up .
Late last year , Android had a daily activation rate of 30000 .
In February , that had doubled to 60000 , and during the keynote , Gundotra announced they were now activating more than 100000 Android devices every day .
They work with 21 OEMs , in 48 countries , on 59 carriers .
The Android Marketplace is stuffed with 50000 applications from 180000 developers .
Another fun little statistic : when Google launched turn - by - turn navigation on Android six months ago , they set an internal goal of 1 billion miles navigated within 12 months .
They reached that goal within six months .
Froyo
Anyway , what ’s new in Android 2.2 , nicknamed “ Froyo ” ?
Well , first of all , there ’s a Just - In - Time compiler now , which improves performance on Android devices two to five times , according to Google .
There ’s also a lot of new enterprise stuff , such as new Exchange features that I ’m not particularly familiar with .
One of the features that really stood out is an internet - to - device messaging service , which , according to Google , is “ much more than a push notification service designed to make up for a lack of basic features like multitasking ” .
This new service can perform some interesting tricks , such as send navigiation instructions looked up on your PC to your Android device – which will automatically open the navigation application and set up the route .
Or , you can send a link to your phone , and the link will be automatically opened on the phone ’s browser .
The possibilities are endless here .
There are more internet - based features in Froyo , such as the ability to stream your entire music collection from your desktop or laptop computer to your phone .
You can play the music on your phone as if it is stored on the device , while it ’s actually being streamed .
Pretty cool .
You can now finally install applications on the SD card .
Android can manage automatically where applications go , or you can move them around manually if you so desire .
Google has finally added the ability to update all applications at once , and took this concept a step further by allowing you to tell applications to update automatically .
Crash reporting has been added as well , so when an application crashes , a full report can be sent straight to the developer .
Also coming in Froyo is tethering and mobile hotspot .
Of course , this will be carrier - dependant , a fact conveniently ignored during the keynote .
It works pretty much as you ’d expect : you flip a switch , and your phone becomes a mobile hotspot .
The demo showed an iPad hooking up to a Nexus One .
The browser has also received a major overhaul in Froyo .
Google has ported the JavaScript engine powering the Chrome desktop browser to the Android browser , yielding significant speed improvements .
According to the company , the browser in Froyo is the fastest mobile browser , a claim backed up by a funny demo application in which Froyo completely obliterated Eclair and the iPad .
“ I wonder if we ’ll get that in the App Store …
Oh wait , it ’s a web app .
Is n’t that great ? ” Gundotra quipped .
Of course , Flash 10.1 was part of the presentation too .
Talking about Flash , Gundotra really went to town on Apple on this one .
The full web includes Flash , and it ’s not up to the phone maker to decide how people view the web .
“ As it turns out , people use Flash ! ” he said .
“ It ’s really fun to work with other folks in the ecosystem to meet the needs of users .
Much better than just saying ‘ no ’ , ” he added , “ We ’re not only committed to having the world ’s fastest browser …
But also the world ’s most comprehensive browser . ”
Flash 10.1 for Android requires Froyo , since a number of API changes were made between 2.1 and 2.2 required for Flash .
The beta is out today , and the final version should land June 17 , although that ’s not been confirmed .
June 17 is the release date for the desktop version of Flash 10.1 , but Android is expected to get Flash that day as well .
Flash for WebOS , BlackBerry , Symbian , and Windows Phone will arrive later this year .
There was also a lot of talk about advertisements ( really ? ) , but most of that was pretty boring .
Suffice to say that Google has added several new ad formats for mobile , including a few remarkably similar to Apple ’s iAd .
Froyo+1
Google also demonstrated several features which will land in the next version of Android , scheduled to be released in the fourth quarter of this year .
For instance , like the webOS , you will be able to browse the Marketplace on your PC , and install applications on your Android devices over - the - air .
You will also be able to buy music in the Marketplace and have it sent to your phone – Gundotra made fun of the connect - phone - to - PC routine .
Google also showed the future of voice recognition – and this really blew everyone away .
A Google employee told a Nexus One “ Pictures of Barack Obama with French president at the G8 summit ” , and the phone gladly complied , launching the correct Google Image search .
“ Pictures of the Golden Gate bridge at sunset ” also worked , and telling the navigation application to go to “ Del Dotto Vineyards ” did n’t prove problematic either .
Heck , even Google Translate works ; “ Can you help me find the nearest hospital ? ” was correctly translated into French , and spoken by the phone .
The future
Android is moving fast – very fast .
In fact , it is developing at a pace that far exceeds its competitors .
Android has been out there for 18 months , and has already seen seven new versions .
Between now and the end of this year , we ’ll see two major new versions ( Froyo today , Gingerbread in Q4 ) .
Apple can manage about one release a year , and already , Froyo adds a lot of tricks iPhone users ( like myself ) can only dream of ; can you imagine what Gingerbread is going to do ?
The situation is n’t much better for Microsoft .
By the time the first Windows Phone devices arrive , Gingerbread will be right around the corner .
Palm needs to get used to being part of HP first , and that might take some time .
RIM kind of does its own thing , and Symbian is n’t developing at a rapid pace either .
A few weeks ago I said the iPhone ’s market share will settle somewhere around the 10 % , and taking into account what Google showed off today , my conviction that this prediction will pan out has only been strengthened .
Apple simply cannot keep up with the insane development pace the open model – whether it is on the software side , or the hardware side .
Love at First Sip : The Journey of a Water Bottle
Water .
One of the building blocks of life .
Aaahhh , how I love thee .
I love thee so much that I do not drink you when you are bottled in plastic .
Now , thanks to some innovative minds , I can drink thee no matter where I am .
Not only will you be delicious but you will also taste like a glass of fresh , cool , and delicious …well , you !
Now my journey to find the perfect water bottle has been a long and distracting one .
Initially , I had not grown wise to the dangers of plastic water bottles , nor had I known about metals leaching .
I was what you would call , naive in the department of ethical , ecological , and down right smart water bottle etiquette .
But today I am happy to write to you all to tell you that I have met my match , and although it may not be perfect , it is the best match that I have found in this lifetime and I am not about to let it go .
Yes , I am still talking about water bottles .
Sometimes you have to know how many bad apples are out there before you can truly appreciate finding ‘ the one ’ .
It all started with a Nalgene , a plastic , durable , easy to measure Nalgene .
Then I read about the dangers of BPA leaching into not only baby bottles , but my own water bottle !
I had bypassed disposable water bottles long ago since they provide horrific build - ups in landfills and the Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch .
And truly , who wants to deal with more waste ( and plastic ) ?
With tap water being plentiful in the United States , I am opting out of using resources to bottle and transport “ portable ” water bottles .
Why not just wash one I like and plan on keeping ( and that does n’t contain harmful carcinogens ) ?
It does n’t sound like such a bad idea .
So I graduated from my camp - friendly Nalgene to the new and improved metal water bottle .
It was free of BPA , durable , and although I could n’t measure or see the liquid inside , I was sure that I had really made a better choice .
Sip after sip I was reminded of my metallic choice and then a little something in the News happened .
Metal = Bad .
Uh-oh .
Now not all metal is created equal , and thankfully I had chosen a safe option but here is the skinny on metal water bottles .
First , like I said before , they are not all bad so do n’t throw yours out ( recycle or reuse it is what you were really going to do anyway though ) just yet .
Now the first distinction is between stainless steel and aluminum .
Aluminum is known to leach , so I suggest taking any aluminum cookware and water bottles out of your kitchen .
Stainless steel on the other hand is the “ good ” metal .
Yet some water bottle manufacturers were coating them with plastic , plastic that contained BPA .
Sigg water bottles , once heralded as the most eco-friendly water bottles in the World was taken down by this fact .
They had at first denied the claims , but then realized that BPA was in fact present in their water bottles .
So now what ?
Two options , first buy a stainless steel , non-plastic coated water bottle ( Klean Kanteen has wonderful recycled bottles ) or see what these ecological and health concerns have spurred in the realm of innovation .
I chose the latter and am pleased to announce the happy union of me and my new , improved ( and nearly perfect ) water bottle .
Please meet my glass water bottle , all 22 ounces of bottle .
Is n’t it beautiful ?
Now I will let you in on our little secret … why I love this water bottle so much , and why you just may want to get your own .
First , there really is nothing like a cool glass of water .
Honestly , every sip tastes like a fresh glass of water .
Now I am not a picky customer when it comes to anything outside of ecological or social standards ( then , you may have realized , I definitely am hard to please ) .
So the fact that I noticed the difference in taste means that it must be significant .
Second , it is easy to clean .
As much as I loved my stainless steel water bottle , the small mouth made it a bit tricky to really clean .
This water bottle has a wide mouth , and since it is glass , nothing is lurking in the shadows .
Third , I have won back the option to measure my drink !
Now for some of you this may not be a selling point , but for anyone who mixes things in their water bottle from lemonade to iodine to clean it , this can come in very handy .
The large loop at the top provides an easy to grasp handle for anyone .
It is made out of plastic # 5 , the only type of plastic that has undergone extensive testing ( and passed ) for having a benign effect on human health .
Lastly , the silicone ( yes , I know , not perfectly sustainable ) protective layer really does work .
I can only say that after two months of extensive testing ( read : dropping , throwing , stepping on , and accidentally kicking ) .
Once it leaped , yes leaped , right off of my bicycle and was still just fine when I came back for it .
Now to address your concerns before making this ( under $ 25 ) commitment .
First , yes it is slightly heavier than a plastic or metal water bottle .
Noticeable ?
Only a little bit .
Honestly after the first two weeks , I did n’t even notice and I carried this water bottle everywhere .
Next , like I stated before , I am yet to successfully break the bottle , despite my intentional and non-intentional efforts .
Lastly , will you forget it ?
I got in the habit of putting it in my purse ( yes this may be a little heavy for some people ) , and I have n’t forgotten it since .
My stainless steel water bottle had a fifty - fifty chance of making it into my bag .
Since this water actually tastes distinctly different it helps trigger my mind in the morning that , yes , I would in fact like to have a fresh drink of water throughout the day .
So if you think you may be equally compatible ( it is hard to believe that anyone could possibly love this water bottle more than I ) then visit Buygreen.com and pick out your dream color .
Yes , it ’s true .
Even though this water bottle and I are truly meant to be together , I am going to share its ‘ digits ’ with you , so you too can find water bottle love .
They also sell Kleen Kanteen , for the stainless steel lovers out there , as well as glass baby bottles similar to my dear love , pictured above .
So you can explore what bottle love may be for anyone .
Cheers !

It ’s been over a month now since the release of the first iPad models .
Apple has sold over a million units of all models , in just 28 days , and there are no signs that sales are slowing down .
Thousands of new applications have been made available on the iTunes AppStore , specifically adapted or designed from the ground up for the iPad .
All seems to be going well , but one thing in all of this bothers me .
There can be no question that a lot of the iPads sold in this first month are no longer in the US , as Apple has taken steps to limit the number of iPads anyone can buy , supposedly in an effort to contain the purchases of large number of devices for international shipment .
I wo n’t question Apple ’s decision of limiting the initial release of the iPad to the US as I feel no company can be expected to be able to simultaneously release a new product , a new physical product , all around the world at the same time .
I wo n’t question Apple ’s decision to impose this per customer limit at this time either , even though it has led to some weird situations such as the customer that has been banned from purchasing iPads for life .
What I find really odd is that Apple seems to just pretend that there no international iPad users as the people who have purchased the device either while traveling or through the gray market are blocked from getting iPad applications from their regional stores .
I ’ve always considered it odd that Apple has a store for each country , but I can understand that the archaic nature of licensing deals for content have forced the company to work that way .
What I find truly amazing is that Apple embraced that same archaic form of organizing content in putting together its AppStore .
It could be a convenience offering the user access in his own language and regionally specific applications , but that does n’t really require a separate store , it just requires the user to fill out some preferences .
With the release of the iPad these restrictions on what users can purchase or even download for free has reached pathetic levels .
When user tries to connect to his regional AppStore with an iPad he is simply blocked .
That is it .
End of story .
No downloading free apps or purchasing some of those new iPad applications you international scum !
The worst of it is that versions of the applications adapted for the iPad are already available on those stores , if the application is a universal binary that can work with both the iPhone and the iPad .
Still , the user is n’t even allowed to download such applications , or even to connect to the store from his / her iPad .
It is depressing that the same company that creates such a fantastical device as the iPad can be so medieval in the way it treats its customers .
Many of these people have traveled with the specific purpose of getting an iPad or paid ridiculously inflated prices to acquire them through the gray , but legal , market .
Many of these customers are software developers , CEOs , CTOs and other top executives and they all have a bad experience in using the product because of artificial restrictions .
There can be no technical reasons for a company of Apple ’s resources not have made iPad applications available to all international AppStores during the month that has passed since the device was introduced .
The fact that it did n’t just forces customers to seek a work around for the difficulty and offers incentive for them to Jailbreak their devices in search of applications to install .
To work around the AppStore block , users have to download iPad compatible applications to their Macs or PCs and then sync them to iPad .
This precludes the new iPad - specific apps as these are not available .
I find it amazing , disappointing and depressing that more than fifteen years after Amazon started shipping books worldwide from a single and very simple website , Apple ca n’t manage or be bothered to service customers of digital downloads in more than one country .

I am beginning to suspect that the “ news ” aspect of LifeNews.com ’s name is far less important than the “ life ” part , considering that the website ’s mission is obviously to slant every article to fit its right - wing agenda .
Just last week we noted how LifeNews printed an article claiming that a “ new study conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency shows a correlation between the use of cells from babies in abortions in vaccines to an increase in autism rates ” when the study itself showed nothing of the sort , as the article was built entirely around the baseless speculations of an anti-choice blogger and presented them as if they were fact .
But that is nothing compared to this new article :
Oklahoma Law to Allow Women Ultrasound Before Abortion Subject to Lawsuit A pro-abortion legal group based in New York City wasted no time in filing a lawsuit against a new Oklahoma law that helps women by allow them a chance to see an ultrasound of their unborn child while considering an abortion .
The lawsuit was filed hours after the Oklahoma state Senate override the governor ’s veto .
The state Senate voted 36 - 12 Tuesday to override Governor Brad Henry on two pro-life bills , including the ultrasound measure .
Apparently , LifeNews does n’t understand the difference between words like “ help ” or “ allow ” and “ force ” :
Oklahoma lawmakers overrode their governor ’s veto Tuesday to enact tough abortion laws that force women to undergo invasive ultrasounds and allow doctors to withhold test results showing fetal defects .
Even women who are victims of rape or incest will be required to listen to a detailed description of the fetus and view the ultrasound image prior to terminating a pregnancy .
They will also likely be required to undergo vaginal rather than abdominal ultrasounds as doctors are required to use the method that “ would display the embryo or fetus more clearly . ”
The new Oklahoma law requires women to get a vaginal ultrasound with no exceptions … but to LifeNews , the law is reported as merely helping women by allowing them a chance to see an ultrasound .
The FCC has given Hollywood permission to activate the " Selective Output Control " technologies in your set - top box .
These are hidden flags that allow the MPAA to deactivate parts of your home theater depending on what you 're watching .
And it sucks .
As Dan Gillmor notes , " Fans of old TV science fiction will remember the Outer Limits .
Given Hollywood 's victory today at the FCC — they 'll be able to reach over the lines and disable functions on your TV — the intro to the show takes on modern relevance . "
The FCC says that they 're doing this because they believe that if they do so , the MPAA will start releasing first - run movies ( the ones that are still in theaters ) for TV .
They say that Hollywood wo n't make these movies available unless they get Selectable Output Control because SOC will stop piracy .
This is ridiculous .
First , it 's ridiculous because this can't ever stop piracy or get first - run movies into your living room .
Even with SOC , the studios are not going to release high - value movies that are still in theatrical distribution for viewing in your house , where you could set up a tripod and high - quality camera ( along with ideal lighting ) in order to make your own camcordered copy and put it online .
Now , the FCC could have solved this by saying that only movies that are in their first theatrical release run can have SOC turned on , but they did n't , because they knew that the MPAA was lying through its teeth about using SOC to enable the " new business model " of showing you first run movies in your home .
Second , it 's ridiculous because it 's possible in the first place .
The FCC ( and the candy - ass consumer electronics companies ) allowed for Selectable Output Control to be inserted into your devices even though they claimed all along that they would never allow it to be used .
Read your Chekhov , people : the gun on the mantelpiece in act one will go off in act three .
Allowing the MPAA to get SOC in your set - top box but " never planning on using it " is like buying a freezer full of chocolate ice - cream and never planning on eating it .
If the CE companies and FCC wanted to prevent SOC from being used , the best way of doing that would be to not include it in devices in the first place .
Finally , this is ridiculous because of what it 's really for : ensuring that Hollywood gets control of all the features in your home 's devices and computers .
Here 's how that works :
SOC only works with DRM - crippled outputs , like those locked with HDCP , DTLA , etc .
Now that some content will have SOC on it , every manufacturer will race to add SOC ( and hence HDCP and DTLA and so on ) to their devices
The committees that run DTLA and HDCP and other DRM cartels are absolutely in thrall to the MPAA .
When I 've attended DRM committee meetings , I 've watched the MPAA reps tie the consumer electronics guys in knots , playing them off against each other , bullying them , dirty tricking them
Putting DTLA or HDCP in your devices is n't simple : in order to do so , you have to comply with an enormous about of restrictions that the MPAA dreams up and crams into the license agreements ( much of these agreements are secret , and not available for regulators or consumer to inspect )
Ergo : now that the FCC has allowed SOC in devices , all devices will have SOC , and since SOC comes with DRM , and since the studios control DRM licensing , and since they shove all kinds of restrictive crap into DRM licenses , the FCC has essentially just guaranteed that the future of all media will be controlled by Hollywood , to our eternal torment and detriment
Now here 's the really scary part :
I 'm not just talking about TVs and set - top boxes here .
This stuff is targetted squarely at operating system vendors .
Both Apple and Microsoft have enthusiastically signed onto adding DRM to their OSes in order to comply with HDCP , DTLA and other " device - based " DRMs .
In the PC world , compliance with DTLA and HDCP rules is n't just about what features the OS can have , but what features the video cards , hard - drives , network interfaces , motherboards and drivers can have .
So the FCC has just handed the keys to specify drivers and components for general purpose PCs to the thrashing dinosaurs of Hollywood .
Because even your cheapo netbook or homebuilt Linux box relies on components that are manufactured for the gigantic mainstream PC and laptop markets .
Now that the mainstream component market has a new de -facto regulator at the MPAA , watch for all of those components to come with restrictions built in .
The Obama White House has done some good , but its administrative branch is stuffed with Hollywood lawyers who are Democratic Party stalwarts .
The FCC has some great tech people on this , but the commissioners ' staffers who wrote this memo are either the most credulous yokels that ever met an MPAA lobbyist , or they 're in the pockets of Big Content .

Smells delicious .
Smells like outside .
Smell like gold and flowers had a baby and named him Long Hammer .
Taste is great .
It ’s got a sort of sweetness to it that I really like .
It reminds me of when I was a kid I would run outside and get honey suckle from the yard and suck the sweetness from …oh god I was giving Mother Nature cunnilingus .
So .. this beer …is like …drinking from Mother Nature ’s vagina .
Sorry for that image .
No , I ’m not .

Feeling happy and secure in our relationships is a goal many people strive for , but in times of need the emotionally insecure partners may be doing us a favor by being more alert to possible danger .
Evolution may have shaped us to consist of groups of emotionally secure and insecure individuals , researchers write in the March issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science .
When faced with threats to close personal relationships , people react in different ways according to their sense of whether the world is a secure place .
The same reaction styles also cause people to be more or less attuned to dangers of all kinds .
Evolution would have favored a mix of these so - called attachment styles if mixed groups were more likely to survive than groups of only secure or only insecure individuals .
" Secure people have disadvantages , " experimental psychologist Tsachi Ein-Dor of the New School of Psychology in Herzliya , Israel , told LiveScience .
" They react slowly and then act slowly because they need to first get organized . "
This notion would explain why almost half of all people in the world have insecure attachment styles , he said , despite the fact that people prefer secure types as romantic partners .
How we view the world
People who do well in relationships have what 's called a secure attachment style .
They tend to view the world as a safe place , and their optimism allows them to focus on tasks without being bogged down with negative thoughts .
They seek out groups and work well in them .
In contrast are those who exhibit insecure attachment styles .
Some people are anxious types , always clinging to their significant other , and others are aloof , or avoidant , preferring to deal with problems on their own instead of relying on their partners .
Attachment behavior is a survival adaptation , said Ein-Dor .
Because infants can't survive on their own , they have to attach themselves to their parents .
If an infant cries and is soothed by its parent , it learns that it can trust other people for love and support .
Those whose parents do n't have time or energy to respond may learn they have to fend for themselves .
Such traits can take on different meanings in a group setting .
When in immediate danger , people should n't necessarily take comfort in the sense of peace and safety a group can provide .
Benefits of being insecure
To test their idea that mixed groups would benefit survival , Ein-Dor and his colleagues put students in groups of threes alone in a room with a concealed smoke machine , which was switched on to simulate a fire .
Groups were quicker to notice the smoke and to react to it if they contained individuals who scored high for insecure attachment .
Groups that had a member who rated high for the anxious attachment style tended to notice the smoke faster than other groups , and those that had a member rating high on attachment avoidance tended to react first , such as by leaving the room .
" This is the first [ paper ]
I 've read that has started to sway me toward the idea that insecure attachment styles are adaptations , " said Paul Eastwick , a psychologist at Texas A&M University , who was not involved in the current study .
" I have always favored more of a ' side effect ' explanation . "
In fact , they ’re so bad , that they can turn any average movie into an hilariously awesome experience .

Boy , 11 , has 10 cm splinter removed from his eye ...
TWO YEARS after falling on a stick
An 11 - year - old boy has had a 10 cm - long wooden splinter pulled from his eye - two years after he fell on a stick while playing with friends ..
Rahul Devi had the splinter removed by surgeons in Delhi , India during a grueling six - hour operation .
The schoolboy had been seconds from death for the past two years as the stick had penetrated his brain , narrowly missing his brain stem and carotid artery .
Freak injury : Rahul Devi , 11 , with his mother before the operation .
The stick was poking out of his left eye under the eyebrow .
It was later extracted by surgeons in a six - hour operation
His mother , Ratna Devi , said : ' The stick broke when he tried to get up .
We took him to a local hospital where the doctors said they could n't remove it .
' So we took him home and hoped maybe it would come out by itself . '
After two years , Rahul could no longer bear the pain and his parents took him fom their home in Kashmir to Delhi .
He was seen by doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ) , who were shocked to see the unusual case .
' I got goose pimples when I saw the boy walk into my outpatient clinic with a stick poking out of his left eye , ' said associate professor Sarat Chandra .
' I was even more horrified to find out this had been there for two years .
During this time he continued with all his activities like playing , going to school , climbing trees and swimming . '
Horrific : A CT scan shows the splinter which was later extracted by surgeons at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ) in Delhi
Deadly :
An MRI scan shows the stick going from the orbit , through the medial part of the temporal lobe and cavernous sinus - missing the internal carotid artery by just 1 mm
Tests revealed the splinter had penetrated the boy 's brain , including areas responsible for speech and vision .
Dr. A K Mahaptra , head of the Neurosurgery department said : ' It was nothing short of miracle .
' All the major areas in the brain were affected by the splinter , but there were no complications .
' It is surprising that he did n't develop an infection as the foreign body has been inside for more than two years .
The boy is simply lucky . '
Doctors had to be very careful during the surgery , as the slightest error may have proved fatal .
They now believe that Rahul , who has lost all vision in his left eye , will take at least a month to recover .
Splinter :
The piece of wood which entered Rahul 's eye and brain

A Gulf Coast disaster has again shocked an entire nation .
The callous corporate disregard for safety , workers ’ lives and environmental devastation is infuriating and mind - boggling .
In March 2005 , 15 workers lost their lives in an unnecessary explosion at the BP refinery in Texas City .
Eleven workers are presumed dead from this latest explosion .
Investigations into the 2005 explosion indicated that BP decided it was cheaper to pay the possible fines than to follow OSHA safety guidelines .
The oil rig continues to leak oil into the Gulf and threatens to destroy the coastal environment of Louisiana , just as the area is beginning to recover from the disaster caused by Hurricane Katrina .
It is clear that the damages inflicted on the Gulf Coast by these two incidents are inestimable and the people of the area will suffer for many years to come .
Some say the economic impact of the disaster on Louisiana will be catastrophic .
The government is in another position of having to “ bailout ” these mega-corporations .
This time it ’s BP .
Just like with the banks , if the refineries and energy corporations were publicly owned , adequate safety standards could be maintained so that workers ’ lives and the environment could be saved and economic disaster avoided .
Instead of the profits being gobbled up for private gain , they could be reinvested in the communities and the larger social - environmental fabric of the country , plus investment for research into green energy sources .
Plus such profits could go to the current clean - up and previous environmental disasters that have left many Gulf Coast communities in ruin .
It ’s a positive step that President Obama has said unequivocally that BP is going to pay for the clean - up and damage .
But a 1990 law capped the damage an oil company would be responsible for to a mere $ 75 million .
That ’s a Big Oil bailout !
Why should we , the people , continue to have to shell out for these private - profit - driven corporations ?
It ’s disaster capitalism !
It ’s time for the people to run things .

Yeah , Elisabeth and I went and saw Ninja Assassin earlier tonight .
I felt really guilty every time I had yogurt in the morning because the only brand I like comes in these little plastic cups , so I started to hoard them in hopes of finding a better use than throwing them away .
After collecting 30 or so I finally discovered that they would make perfect seed starters !
All you have to do is put holes in the bottom .
To do this I grabbed a pair of pliers , heated a nail and used it to poke 4 - 6 holes in the bottom of the containers .
Even though this process does n't seem to create fumes , you should always turn a fan on whenever you apply heat to plastic , or find a way to do it outdoors .
If you are using a waxed paper cup , like an old coffee cup you can simply pierce the nail through the bottom , no heat is necessary .
I also trimmed the edges of mine to make them look nicer , but this is n't necessary .
These yogurt containers came in a fitted plastic tray , but it does n't matter if you do n't have that .
A shallow cardboard box would do , like the lid of a shoebox or the cardboard tray kind pop cans are sometimes shipped in .
To author Upton Sinclair , the hellish world of factory slaughterhouses was as dangerous to human beings as it was to pigs .
He filled his 1906 novel The Jungle with meat - packing images that seem ripped from a slasher movie :
“ ... and as for the other men , who worked in tank - rooms full of steam , and in some of which there were open vats near the level of the floor , their peculiar trouble was that they fell into the vats ; and when they were fished out , there was never enough of them left to be worth exhibiting — sometimes they would be overlooked for days , till all but the bones of them had gone out to the world as Durham ’s Pure Leaf Lard ! ”
Sinclair ’s abattoir labourers get so desensitized to violence that rates of murder , rape and brawls among them rise .
The book cemented the link between slaughterhouses and crime for decades to come — long before pig farmer and serial killer Robert Pickton haunted headlines .
More than a hundred years later , a University of Windsor researcher may have proven the literary classic right .
Criminology professor Amy Fitzgerald says statistics show the link between slaughterhouses and brutal crime is empirical fact .
In a recent study , Fitzgerald crunched numbers from the FBI ’s Uniform Crime Report database , census data , and arrest and offence reports from 581 U.S. counties from 1994 to 2002 .
“ I have a graph that shows that as the number of slaughterhouse workers in a community increases , the crime rate also increases , ” she says .
Fitzgerald says she was inspired by The Jungle to study crime records in U.S. communities where slaughterhouses are located .
She became fascinated by studies of the environmental effects of slaughterhouses that mentioned crime rates , without explanation , seemed to go up when the factories opened in communities .
Fitzgerald carefully weighed the figures in order to see whether a link really existed .
She found that an average - sized slaughterhouse with 175 employees would annually increase the number of arrests by 2.24 and the number of reports by 4.69 .
The larger the abattoir , the worse the local crime problem .
She controlled for factors such as the influx of new residents when slaughterhouses open , high numbers of young men — even the number of immigrants .
“ Some residents started to recognize that the crime rates were going up and started complaining , and the slaughterhouse companies were quick to blame the immigrant labour pool they were relying on , ” Fitzgerald says .
She found that abattoirs still seemed to raise the crime numbers when she controlled for these factors .
Nor can the violence be blamed on factory work itself .
Fitzgerald compared slaughterhouse communities to those with comparison industries — dangerous , repetitive work that did not involve killing animals .
These were not associated with a rise in crime at all , she says .
In some cases , they seemed to bring the crime rate down .
“ The unique thing about ( abattoirs ) is that ( workers are ) not dealing with inanimate objects , but instead dealing with live animals coming in and then killing them , and processing what ’s left of them . ”
More studies are needed to determine if crimes were being committed by factory workers or by others in the community , she says , and how exactly that kind of work could cause crime to go up .
But the numbers leave few other explanations other than the slaughterhouses being somehow to blame .
It ’s a case of science catching up to what has been folk knowledge since industrialized slaughterhouses began to appear in the 19th century : workers exposed to the killing of large numbers of animals on a regular basis become disturbed and appear to lose empathy .
The Jungle made such anecdotal tales a mass scandal , galvanizing readers and prompting President Theodore Roosevelt to order reforms to the meat industry .
Within months of publication , the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection
Act were signed into law .
Sinclair ’s book advocated socialist ideals as an alternative to the exploitation of labour epitomized by the factory abattoirs .
Buts the etiology of the problem remains something of a chicken - and - egg puzzle .
Do slaughterhouses desensitize workers to killing ?
Or , could the work attract people who are less sensitive to begin with ?
Fitzgerald suggests a similarity between slaughterhouse communities and military communities , which have been studied for higher incidence rates of partner abuse .
“ One of ( the explanations ) is the violence they witness and sometimes have to participate in might result in some kind of desensitization , ” she says .
But the correlation was not as strong for smaller farms where animals were killed .
“ It seems like there ’s something about the industrialization process , ” says Fitzgerald .
“ you have people who are actually responsible for slaughtering thousands of animals a day . ”
Canadian slaughterhouses were left out of the report , and Fitzgerald says she wants to do a similar study here in the future .
In Toronto , where abattoirs have been nestled in quiet areas such as the Junction ( before it burned down in 2006 ) and King Street West , the violence seems hard to spot .
Residents of the pretty , tree - lined Garrison Creek neighbourhood say the only time they notice Toronto Abattoirs Ltd. and Quality Meat Packers Ltd. factory at the bottom of Tecumseth St. is on warmer days , when a putrid scent wafts over the patios and the nearby baseball field .
“ On good days it ’s like a farm , ” says Antonio Ferreira , a 15 - year resident of a red - brick highrise at King St. W. and Niagara St . “ On a bad day it ’s like a rotting carcass . ”
He could n’t recall any violent incidents at or near the abattoir , however .
Workers trickling out of Toronto Abattoirs ’ revolving turnstile simply said that they liked working there “ fine , ” but would n’t say more about what their jobs were like .

Although slaughterhouse conditions have improved immensely since Sinclair published his scathing descriptions of disease - ridden equipment and slave wages , they still exist to do one job : the methodical butchering of animals on a massive scale .
And that job still requires people to do it .
“ There is something unique about the slaughterhouses , ” says Fitzgerald .
“ There ’s definitely a need for further research to figure out exactly what that is . ”
The Ibogaine Experience
[ Note From The " Editor " :
This was written by a friend of mine circa 2006 about her experience with battling heroin addiction through the use of Ibogaine therapy .
I 'll be leaving all the typos , punctuation errors , and run-on sentence intact for the sake of preserving how she felt she wanted the story to be told .
I feel that this is important since the amount of these types of experiences is very limited . ]
I firmly believe that what saved my Life was Ibogaine .
And I firmly believe that the people that have taken it , are called to it .
As I sat in the filth encrusted room of the motel room 354 , getting ready to inject the golden brown liquid I thought was to be my future and my death , the phone starting to ring .
Unusual as the two people that actually lived in this hell hole had cell phones , so I continued to tie off and finish fixing .
But the damn phone would not stop ringing and he did n’t like it .
“ Dude .
What the fuck ?
Pick up the fucking phone would you ? ” he snapped .
“ Fine . Fine . Sorry . ”
Taking the blame because it was always my fault .
I reached over , needle still in my arm , my life juice reasy to be booted , and answered .
“ What ’s up , Junky ? ” said a snappy , smart , and clear headed woman on the other end .
At this point , I had no clue who she was and little did I know that this woman was about to save my life .
I was n’t concerned with that very much .
“ Fuck you .
Who are you ?
What the fuck do you want ? ” I snapped back , almost ready to put the phone down .
“ Oh .
We ’re grumpy , I see .
Well why do n’t you finish that shot and we ’ll talk . ”
How the hell did she know ?
Freaked out , I did finish that shot and began to motion for him to look out the window .
I had no clue who she was and could she see me ?
She introduced herself .
She told me she had heard all about me and that she wanted me .
No one had ever wanted me for anything before .
Fine .
My interest was piqued .
She had me .
She began talking , in that fast way that she does : “ I want you to get down to Miami Beach .
I want you in St. Kitts in time for the next round .
My plane leaves for there in an hour and a half and I only have a few more minutes .
This will help you .
This is not like the others .
I promise .
This will make things different .
pack your bags and get down here .
Now .
Oh and P --- will be caling you .
And just like that , she hung up .
I was confused , curious , and quite possibly a little more than freaked out .
But I had bigger things to think about .
The dope was gone , as was the money .
And the rest of the day was going to be spent getting more .
It sucked , but there was no other way .
We contemplated jacking the TV in the room , but it was worth all of maybe $ 20 .
Fine .
Grab it .
Off to the Pawn Shop and Bank of America to make a deposit , consequently with nothing in it .
But if you do it through the ATM and then withdraw some , it lets you .
A few hours later , we were on our way to the worst part of Chicago .
And I had to make the run .
I always had o make the run .
Half the money first .
The second half later .
No hot shots .
No getting beat .
As we pulled up , that familiar metallic taste hit my mouth .
I was truly at the lowest point in my life .
I had nothing .
Spiritually , emotionally , physically , and morally bankrupt .
We had n’t hit all the local Targets and Walmarts that day because we had enough , but usually we did .
I went in to buy stuff with my checks and get money back .
just to piss him off , I would spend more time than I needed to .
I would try on shoes , check out CDs .
Sometimes I would even buy more , but this day I did n’t .
This day , I got the dope and got out of there .
I hated passing by the basketball courts , I kept my head down .
I did n’t want any trouble and I did n’t want to see the reality of where I was .
On the way back to the motel , feeling much , much better , my cell phone started buzzing .
Fuck .
Who was this ?
“ Dude .
Ahhh , what ;s up ? ” a scrathy voice other the other end of the line crackled .
“ Um , not much .
What do you want ? “ “ Ibogaine .
Man , Ibogaine .
She told me to call you .
She wants you here and you do realize she gets what she wants ?
And do n’t be afraid . ”
“ I have been to 12 treatment centers .
They just do n’t work for me .
I ’m sorry , but I doubt this will either . ”
“ Well , fuck .
I ’m not convincing you .
It ’s a beautiful thing , though .
Too bad your junky ego wo n’t let you even come down and try it .
Because you have no idea .
No clue what this invitation will do for you . ”
I do n’t know how they did it .
i do n’t know how they knew , but they knew .
They knew exactly how to get at just what i wanted .
But I still was n’t ready .
I knew I had to be in Miami by the 11th , or I would not make it .
It was still the end of July .
Plus , I really thought it would not work for me .
But only a few days later , I was making that phone call to my mom .
My mom had set this whole thing up .
A long time ago , she decided to just wait for the phone call and prepare for my death .
So she let me go .
She began to study botany and is now extremely knowledgable in that area .
She had gone on a conference about two weeks before my initial ohone call with her .
It was about plants used to heal cancer , hepatitis , and other diseases .
My sweet , tiny mother raised her hand .
that one burning question on her mind .
“ Has anyone heard of anything that helps with addiction ? ”
One maan answered her on the break .
He told her he knew of someone in Miami .
He promised he would call her with the number when they got home .
My mother never thought he would , but he did .
That is how my journay to Ibogaine began .
I arrived home on Sunday .
I had an appointment with the doctor on Monday .
I was sick , but they were not letting me out of the house .
I was going crazy .
I counted down the hours .
We arrived at his office early and this man I did n’t know began his questions , his exam , and prompty took me to this crazy detox place that was more of a Bed & Breakfas than anything I ’d ever been to .
I had 11 days until I would be leaving .
The cleaner I was , the better the Ibogaine would work .
Resetting the brain chemicals and scrubbing those receptors clean .
The trip there was largely uneventful .
I kept playing the Dead on my CD player .
I ignored the other patients .
I was n’t there to make friends .
I was there to give it everything I had and see .
Just see what happened .
Arriving on St. Kitts , the energy was amazing .
I still felt slight withdrawals ; I did n’t like it when people touched me .
But I never liked that .
I befriended an amazing therapist who used holotropic breath work and other forms of psychedelics to reach greater levels of consciousness .
I had no idea that she and the doctor would become my future boss and best friend .
No clue .
Because Ibogaine is primarily taken by the Buiti tribes in equatorial West Africa , she had the place set up very much like as close to a real setting as possible .
However , some parts were very clinical , if only because she was performing a study .
The night before taking the sacrament , those who were going under , were not allowed to eat ( Oh , food sounded so good . ) , we were annointed with special oils , we were told special secrets to carry with us into the next world , we pulled special cards to find out which animal might represent us .
I was the Turtle .
The turtle who loved the Earth and found great healing energy through touch .
If only I knew how true that was at the time .
The peaceful Turtle stayed with me throughout my journey .
the next morning went by slowly as one by one we went to the special cottage .
We were two in a room with a nurse for each of us .
I was the last to go .
I had to have an IV .
The doctor worried about my health and hydration and potassium level as it was .
I hate IVs .
I almost walked out .
But i did n’t .
The energy coming from that cottage was too powerful to leave .
Some of the women were far into their journey ’s .
I wanted that .
In went the IV , after several tries and lots of tears .
I kept thinking it would bother me somehow .
And it did , but I ’ll tell you about it later .
I was wearing my favorite pajamas .
And my glasses .
the nurse , Yolanda , was a native and I could barely understand her when not under , but she loved to call me The Nerd .
Ha !
How true .
I slipped my body into the cool sheets .
The pillow was sooooo good .
My mind and body was floating and I had n’t even been given my capsules yet .
A normal dose for Her to give for someone my height and weight is two pills .
She has it titrated down to 98 % pure Ibogaine , so none of the other nasty stuff .
Plus , she does it herself is a ceremony with a doctor from Africa .
I waited for her to come and dose me .
i had been given a shot .
Something to take the edge off and something to take the full on pukeness away .
But , sometimes , it is good to puke .
Sometimes you have to get that stuff up and out .
I was quiet .
The lady next to me was there and fully into her dose .
I was anxious and she walked in the room .
FOUR FUCKING PILLS .
No way .
I do n’t want that many .
Honey , it ’s an Ego Shattering dose .
You need it .
Holy God , no way .
I was too scared .
down the hatch .
No turning back .
It kicks in anywhere from 20 - - 45 minutes .
Two hours later , I was still getting up to pee from all that damn water in my IV .
Nothing .
Nothing .
The nurse brought Her in because NOTHING was happening .
She told me to Let it go .
Let go .
Then she said : Lie down .
Breathe .
Breathe in - - - BOOOM !
Full on body slam .
Nothing gradual .
That was the last thing I heard .
her voice .
And then , JUST like Alice , I began tumbling backwards off the bed .
i tried to grab for it , but I could n’t .
I was no longer in the bed .
Fear gripped me , but there was this strange sense of something .
In setting out to write this , I knew that there are some things that just cannot be explained .
Some things you just have to get .
I soon realized I was not in my body anymore .
The doctor and nurse ran to the heart machine .
I saw strips of paper being run off .
They were taking my pulse .
It was somewhere in the 20s , but I was n’t dead .
I just was n’t in my body anymore .
I watched the scene for a moment and She looked up , almost as if right into my eyes , and waved .
Goodbye , I thought .
I am leaving , but I will be back .
I watched the two beds , the cottage , I was going higher and higher , I saw the island , the ocean , North America , I looked to my right .
Africa .
I smiled .
I went up and up and up .
Holy shit .
I gasped for breath .
A voice , distinctly feminine , said “ It ’s alright ..
Do n’t leave .
We have n;t started yet .
TRUST . ” I did .
Fine .
Show me , if you must .
The fear was still there .
The Ego was not gone yet .
The plant is feminine .
The journey was very much so .
Whether that is because at the time I did not believe in any masculine form of a God , or because of my Women ’s Studies minor , I do n’t know .
I just know that God , the Goddess , Energy , whatever you choose to call it , knew .
It knew that however it had to appear to me was feminine or I would disbelieve it on principle .
But that part came much later .
After much breaking down of the Ego .
I was allowed to “ have fun ” for a little while .
I had someone with me , a fairy , ans she allowed me to go places in the Universe .
I sat on the rings of Saturn , they were studier than you might think .
I could see Earth as a tiny dot in the distance and i began to ask questions .
Why me ?
How will I ever get better ?
What happened ?
Where am I going ?
Questions that were important , ot so I thought .
She showed me the answers .
Suddenly the stars began to disappear and I saw a vision of myself .
Complete down to the clothes I had on , except for one , major piece was missing .
Right where my heart should be was a hole .
I could put my hand through it , see the other side , it was bizarre .
And then the whole began filling up : Needles , junk , drugs , boyfriends , old friends , horses , school , everything I thought I ever cared about went inside .
Everything , but my family .
Everything but the Spiritual side .
And then she took a deep breath and blew on me .
I began to disappear .
I began to fade away like dust .
I was screaming and crying and sobbing , NO , over and over .
I still continues to die .
I was dying right there as I stared into my very own , souless eyes .
“ This is what you are .
This is what you have become .
do you think any of these things actually do something for you ?
Do you think they fill you up , make you whole ? ” she was talking .
I could hear her crisp , light , clear , high - pitched voice .
She was dead serious .
And later , I would witness my own death .
She was just trying to show me .
She left me there .
By myself to think .
A few moments later I was on a swing I used to play on at the park .
I was swinging away , the breeze in my hair , but I still felt dirty .
Unwhole .
And then She appeared .
She took my hand and lead me through the forest and showed me what life was really about .
Again , we went to look at the Earth from above .
I could see the Energy .
i could see it bubbling up , like a fountain , and spilling back in .
I could see the affect in had on people .
I went from seeing the big picture , to seeing things in the smaller picture .
I took a little walk with God around the Earth .
We plunged through people .
Each one I could feel their energy .
Whether they had Faith or not .
I could feel God cry when we passed through a heart with no Faith .
With no Belief .
I could feel , if only for that moment that seemed like an eternity what it felt like to be God .
And how She cries when She loses us .
It was a sadness so profound , so literal , my heart could not bear its weight .
And I totally use the word She interchangably .
She was probably an It .
I do n;t know .
It just felt feminine to me , but I think the more I have meditated on it and what I saw , it was not necessarily anything other than an Energy or a Lifeforce .
We went back to some kind of palace where she sat cross legged and the real questions began .
She was the one asking .
She was the one breaking me down , piece by piece .
She questioned my Life , my Beliefs , what I had been doing .
Everything .
I had to have answers and i did .
They were not easy .
When she was done , she told me to go and sit .
I was in a movie theatre .
One just for me .
Except the screens were like flying pieces of white board , flying past my face , and I felt like they were going so fast .
I tried to grab on to one and then the screen would come in front of my face and a memory would come into view .
i would live back through that memory and somehow I would change what had happened .
Instead of the memory being something where I held my head down in shame , i would end up holding my head up high and feeling proud .
The memories were as far back as when I was three months old .
Surely I felt like I was missing so many , as they were whizzing by my head , but I was told I got the important ones .
I would work on the rest later .
This memory fix lasted a long time .
I went through and sifted through memories I had n’t remembered until then .
I then spoke to my ancestors .
The people in my family who came before me .
And also the ones who were still around .
I said a prayer for each of them .
I apologized .
One very specific memory was speaking with my dog , Bailey .
She was my baby .
She lived with me through everything .
She had been there through everything .
She could talk !
She spoke of the time I OD ’ed in front of her and the fear it caused her .
Oh , it was painful to hear .
But I listened .
I listened to what every one had to say .
And in the end , they all told me they loved me .
Throughout this whole time , there is something I failed to mention .
Something that ties in very closely with the Energy .
The duration of Ibogaine I listened to music and had my eyes closed , as it was imperative for a good journey .
However , the music faded when the Ibogaine hit .
The sound I heard throughout was a constant buzzing .
i’d liken it to a weed whacker , but I know what it is as it was explained to me .
My senses were so heightened that I could literally hear the molecules of energy .
the particles , atoms , neutrons , and protons , all bouncing off each other .
This is what that sound was .
I did n’t know it until
She explained that to me , but i knew it .
And when I began to play around with it , I heard various other conversations I was n’t supposed to hear .
But I did not do that until the end of my journey .
After the theatre showing of my life , I was told I must see the roots of Tabernanthe Iboga .
And zooooom !
Just like that I was as tiny as a woodsprite and fairy in the jungles of Cameroon .
I lived with them and watched how they sustained themselves through the Earth , giving and taking .
A mutual form of respect between these creatures and Mother Earth .
She provided , never failing .
They had gratitude , never afraid of showing it .
I saw an old , black man .
A shaman .
He was colecting Iboga for a ceremony .
A real Buiti and I could distinctly hear Mama Iboga ’s voice directing him as to where the plant lay hidden .
I felt like it was something I was n’t supposed to hear , but I was - soooo .
I do n’t know .
Suddenly it was night .
There was a fire and I was in the church in the village .
I was invisible to most , but not all .
I had plenty of knowing winks , as I watched their ceremony in awe .
The dancing .
The firelight .
The absolute sacredness of the plant .
Four people were being iniated that evening .
Surprised to see them , I walked over as the dancing and drumming began .
OH MY GOD !
There I lay , one of the participants .
Suddenly I was full force in my body lying on the ground .
How did this happen ?
I could feel the forces and the Energy all within me .
Part of me wanting to take , take , take , but I knew better .
I gave it right back .
it is n’t and never will be mine to own .
It is always a give and a take .
But there will always be a vampire energy sucker .
Protect yourself from those people .
I suddenly found myself in the middle of the village , daylight .
But I was still in the church , under the ceremony .
I was in a sand pit .
I was being sucked down and the more fear I had the further down I went .
Down , down , down .
And then .
Faith .
Faith that either this was taking me somewhere or the plant was showing me something .
As soon as I realized this , a set of stairs with a rope came from the sky .
I grabbed it and I went up , up , up .
Goodbye , Ego .
I left that crying baby back in the church to be watched by someone else .
Truly , it was wrapped up in a receiving blanket and handed off to an elder and I was to trust the words , “ Leave it be .
You can always take it back if you really want it . ”
The initiation ritual ended with prayers .
More dancing and more drumming .
I was standing upright .
I could feel the grasp of fingers on my feet .
WHAT ?
All of a sudden I was back in my body .
Back in the bed on St. Kitts .
The nurse was worried .
18 hours and I had n’t moved a muscle .
I had n’t been there .
She , the doctor , came over and whispered in my ear .
I could not understand her .
What I said back later was some version of an Africaans .
I said I waned a Snickers and I was really hungry .
I do n’t remember that part .
The nurse and the doctor both said I needed to drink .
Do n’t remember it .
i do remember sitting up , drinking , and looking over at my roommate .
She was still out , but had come out of it enough to eat dinner .
She was just in the processing stage .
Which happens after and is long and crazy , but you just somehow go through all that you ’ve seen .
My nurse was in charge of my music .
She said the funny thing was that both of us in the room only wanted to hear Dark Side of The moon and had requested in at the same times , over and over .
I do n’t remember it .
And I was n’t done yet .
I still had more “ work ” to do .
I told them to leave me alone .
And that ’s when I grabbed my roommate .
I grabbed her energy and took her with me .
We went flying like eagles .
And I would catch her on a tree .
i could feel our Energy swirling around and around .
like two little kids playing tag .
We were having fun .
We decided to roam the campus .
We sat in on the staff meeting where they were discussing another person ’s case .
later on , i repeated verbatim everything that was said in the room .
She , the doctor , freaked out .
It was funny .
It was good .
It was NOT a bad thing .
It ended with tearful goodbyes to my fairy , Mama Iboga , and the God Like Energy .
i did n’t want them to leave , but they told me they had given me everything i would need .
They told me I was now initiated , to be careful .
To make MY WAY in this world .
I would .
I would somehow .
I have .
I still am .
It ’s a beautiful , if not sometimes painful experience .
I can see past the person , into their soul .
Sometimes their pain is too great .
On the day we were scheduled to leave St. Kitts , 9 - 11 happened and the pain was so great I had to see the therapist .
I did some holotropic breathwork , which eased it and taught me how to control things a bit more .
It also brought out a few more painful memories and I went through them , just like I did on Ibogaine .
It was weird .
It was crazy .
It was beautiful and knowing and special .
I left a totally different person .
I left someone who cared about me .
Because I am not someone worth throwing away .
After the full on effects of Ibogaine wore off , some 21 hours later , I emerged that room a different person entirely .
I had courage , strength , and a Faith I had never known .
Tests were done to see different things .
After all , it was still a research project back then .
I was SKF 051 . 51st female to take Ibogaine in that setting .
The ataxia was so bad , I was forced to sit .
I did n’t want to .
It was fun being wobbly and I could not stop laughing .
For the life of me , I could not stop laughing .
Everything was funny .
Do n’t take yourself too seriously .
It ’s not all bad .
I remember the porch and how dark it was .
Four women , all had taken Ibogaine that day , sitting out there and smoking .
She , the doctor , came up to me .
“ You saw it , ” she said .
“ I did , “ I replied with a giggle and a wink .
She looked me dead in the eyes , never one to fool around , “ you have a lot of responsibility now , you know that , right ? ” “ I am ready .
I do . ”
Another wink .
Another nod .
She whispered in my ear and told me not to tell them what I saw .
It does n’t happen that way for everyone .
I do n’t know if that is true , but I worked for her for a long time and the stories always varied .
No one was ever out for 21 hours , however .
Not one muscle moved .
Then she said , “ He thought you were dead .
I knew you just left . ”
And she got up and went inside .
Yeah .
I just left .
And I learned a whole lot too .
I have since been back to take the plant once more from St. Kitts and once from Mexico .
All interesting , none quite like the first .
All amazing .
All unique .
All wonderful .
I learned something from everyone .
I am a vessel .
I can choose to carry around what I choose , but that Energy always wants me to choose Love .
Always .
I saw myself die that first time .
I saw it all .
How .
What .
Where .
When .
I saw the funeral .
I saw my mom spreading my ashes .
It was ugly , not pretty .
It hurt , but it was real .
Very real .
And I do n't want to live that way .
I do n't want to be that person .
So I am not .
It is my daily choice .
Today , I am not that person .
Oh and that IV , the first time .
The first hour , everytime the nurse changed the bag or stopped it or started it , I had to peeeee .
I got up , like , 15 times .
And everytime , once I got back into bed , my visions started with the IV going into my arm and bursting forth into a new plane of existence .
I do n’t know why .
It was weird .
They say some visions you will never understand , some you will remember and know why later , some you may never .
That one has me stumped .
If you felt this story opened your eyes even just a bit to the extent of Ibogaine 's usefulness in treatment for addiction , please consider supporting MAPS and their efforts , especially in the realm of Ibogaine .
A low - budget indie film shooting inside a Long Island convenience store got a dose of real life drama last night when a passerby mistook a robbery scene for the real thing and called the cops .
Twenty officers responded to the call , and when they arrived at the scene , they saw a man pointing a gun at another man behind the register .
The director was filming from the back of the store with a small high - definition camera and no movie lights , so it was not immediately clear to cops that they were charging into an imaginary holdup with guns drawn .
" The first officer arrives , looks in the window and he sees a gentleman with a gun pointed at the counter , " Nassau County Police spokesman Vincent Garcia tells the Daily News .
" So he enters the store and confronts the individual , and says , ' Police , drop the gun . '
The individual puts his hands up in the air and says , ' It 's a movie !
It 's a movie !...
The officer used great restraint in not firing his weapon .
Even when the officers were in the store they did not see the camera . "
According to Garcia , the officer repeated his order to drop the gun several times before forcibly disarming the actor .
No arrests were made .
The role of the store owner was played by actual Cool Stop manager Sanjay Patel , who tells Newsday , " I thought it was part of the movie . "
Even director Fred Carpenter , who also wrote the script , was confused : " For a moment I thought they were part of the movie then I thought , wait a minute , I did n't write this scene .
It was very tense for a while . "
His movie , Jesse , concerns a Nassau County Police detective who is investigating the death of her brother who was killed by the mob .
Carpenter was supposed to film a scene at the Nassau County Police Headquarters today , but that shoot has been canceled .
By popular demand , here is the second installment in the series of posts on parsing C++ using the new GCC plugin architecture .
In the previous post we concentrated on setting up the plugin infrastructure and identifying the point in the compilation sequence where we can perform our own processing .
In this post we will see how to work with the GCC AST ( abstract syntax tree ) in order to access the parsed C++ representation .
By the end of this post we will have a plugin implementation that prints the names , types , and source code locations of all the declarations in the translation unit .
First let ’s cover a few general things about the GCC internals and AST that are useful to know .
GCC C++ compiler , cc1 plus , can only process one file at a time ( you can pass several files to the compiler driver , g++ , but it simply invokes cc1 plus separately for each file ) .
As a result , GCC does n’t bother with encapsulation and instead makes heavy use of global variables .
In fact , most of the “ data entry points ” are accessible as global variables .
We have already seen a few such variables in the previous post , notably , error_count ( number of compilation errors ) and main_input_filename ( name of the file being compiled ) .
Perhaps the most commonly used such variable is global_namespace which is the root of the AST .
The GCC AST itself is a curious data structure in that it is an implementation of the polymorphic data type idea in C ( next time someone tells you that polymorphism works perfectly in C and they do n’t need “ bloated ” C++ for that , show them the GCC AST ) .
The base “ handle ” for all the AST nodes is the tree pointer type .
Because the actual nodes can be of some “ extended ” types , access to the data stored in the AST nodes is done via macros .
All such macros are spelled in capital letters and normally perform two operations : they check that the actual node type is compatible with the request and , if so , they return the data requested .
A large number of macros defined for the AST are predicates .
That is , they check for a certain condition and return true or false .
Such macros normally end with _P .
Each tree node in the AST has a tree code of type int which identifies what kind of node it is .
To get the tree code you use the TREE_CODE macro .
Another useful global variable available to you is tree_code_name which is an array of strings containing human - readable tree code names .
It is quite useful during development to see what kind of tree nodes you are getting , for example :
tree decl = ... int tc ( TREE_CODE ( decl ) ) ; cerr << " got " << tree_code_name[tc ] << endl ;
Each tree node type has a tree code constant defined for it , for example , TYPE_DECL ( type declaration ) , VAR_DECL ( variable declaration ) , ARRAY_TYPE ( array type ) , and RECORD_TYPE ( class / struct type ) .
Oftentimes macros that only apply to a specific kind of nodes have their names start with the corresponding prefix , for example , macro DECL_NAME can only be used on *_DECL nodes and macro TYPE_NAME can only be used on *_TYPE nodes .
To allow the construction of the AST out of the tree nodes , the tree type supports chaining nodes in linked lists .
To traverse such lists you would use the TREE_CHAIN macro , for example :
tree decl = ... for ( ; decl != 0 ; decl = TREE_CHAIN ( decl ) ) { ... }
The AST type system also supports two dedicated container nodes : vector ( TREE_VEC tree code ) and two - value linked list ( TREE_LIST tree code ) .
However , these containers are used less often and will be covered as we encounter them .
One major class of nodes in the GCC AST is declarations .
A declaration in C++ names an entity in a scope .
Examples of declarations include a type declaration , a function declaration , a variable declaration , and a namespace declaration .
To get to the declaration ’s name we use the DECL_NAME macro .
This macro returns a tree node of the IDENTIFIER_NODE type .
To get the declaration ’s name as const char * we can use the IDENTIFIER_POINTER macro .
For example :
tree decl = ... ; tree id ( DECL_NAME ( decl ) ) ; const char * name ( IDENTIFIER_POINTER ( id ) ) ;
While most declarations have names , there are certain cases , for example an unnamed namespace declaration , where DECL_NAME can return NULL .
Other macros that are useful when dealing with declarations include TREE_TYPE , DECL_SOURCE_FILE , and DECL_SOURCE_LINE .
TREE_TYPE returns the tree node ( with one of the * _TYPE tree codes ) corresponding to the type of entity being declared .
The DECL_SOURCE_FILE and DECL_SOURCE_LINE macros return the file and line information for the declaration .
Let ’s now see how we can use all this information to traverse the AST and print some information about the declarations that we encounter .
The first thing that we need is a way to get the list of declarations for a namespace .
The GCC Internals documentation states that we can call the cp_namespace_decls function to get “ the declarations contained in the namespace , including types , overloaded functions , other namespaces , and so forth . ”
However , this is not the case .
With this function you can get to all the declarations except nested namespaces .
This is because nested namespace declarations are stored in a different list in the cp_binding _level struct .
If you want to know what the cp_binding _level is for , I suggest that you read its description in the GCC headers .
Otherwise , you can just treat it as magic and use the following code to access all the declarations in a namespace :
void traverse ( tree ns ) { tree decl ; cp_binding_level * level ( NAMESPACE_LEVEL ( ns ) ) ; // Traverse declarations . // for ( decl = level - > names ; decl != 0 ; decl = TREE_CHAIN ( decl ) ) { if ( DECL_IS_BUILTIN ( decl ) ) continue ; print_decl ( decl ) ; } // Traverse namespaces . // for ( decl = level -> namespaces ; decl != 0 ; decl = TREE_CHAIN ( decl ) ) { if ( DECL_IS_BUILTIN ( decl ) ) continue ; print_decl ( decl ) ; traverse ( decl ) ; } }
You may be wondering what the DECL_IS_BUILTIN checks are for .
Besides the declarations that come from the file being compiled , the GCC AST also contains a number of implicit declarations for RTTI , exceptions , and static construction / destruction support code as well as compiler builtin declarations .
Normally we would want to skip such declarations since we are not interested in them .
But feel free to disable the above checks and see what happens .
The print_decl ( ) function is shown below :
void print_decl ( tree decl ) { int tc ( TREE_CODE ( decl ) ) ; tree id ( DECL_NAME ( decl ) ) ; const char* name ( id ?
IDENTIFIER_POINTER ( id ) : " < unnamed > " ) ; cerr << tree_code_name[tc ] << " " << name << " at " << DECL_SOURCE_FILE ( decl ) << " : " << DECL_SOURCE_LINE ( decl ) << endl ; }
Let ’s now plug this code into the GCC plugin skeleton that we developed last time .
All we need to do is add the traverse ( global_namespace ) ; call after the following statement in gate_callback ( ) :
// // Process AST .
Issue diagnostics and set r // to 1 in case of an error .
// cerr << " processing " << main_input_filename << endl ;
We can now try to process some C++ code with our plugin .
Let ’s try the following few declarations :
void f ( ) ; namespace n { class c {} ; } typedef n : : c t ; int v ;
The output from running our plugin on the above code will be something along these lines :
starting plugin processing test.cxx var_decl v at test.cxx:10 type_decl t at test.cxx : 8 function_decl f at test.cxx : 1 namespace_decl n at test.cxx : 4 type_decl c at test.cxx:5
When I just started working with the GCC AST , I expected that I would be iterating over declarations in the same order as they were declared in the source code .
As you can see from the above output this is clearly not the case .
While having multiple lists for declarations ( for example , names and namespaces in the namespace node ) would already not allow such ordered iteration , the order of declarations in the same list is not preserved either , as evident from the above output .
And it gets worse .
Consider the following C++ fragment :
namespace n { class a {} ; } void f ( ) ; namespace n { class b {} ; }
The output from our plugin looks like this :
function_decl f at test.cxx :6 namespace_decl n at test.cxx : 2 type_decl b at test.cxx:10 type_decl a at test.cxx:3
What happens is GCC merges all namespace declarations for the same namespace into a single AST node .
If you think about what GCC does with the AST , this organization is not really surprising .
In the end , all GCC cares about are function bodies for which it needs to generate machine code .
And for that the order of declarations is not important .
However , if you are going to produce any kind of human - readable information from the AST , then you will probably want this information to be in the declaration order as found in the source code .
There is a way to iterate over declarations in the source code order , however , it requires a bit of extra effort .
In a nutshell , the idea is to first collect all the declarations , then sort them according to the source code order , and finally traverse that sorted list of declarations .
But how can we sort the declarations according to the source code order ?
We have seen how to get the file name and line information for a declaration , however , we cannot compare this information without a complete knowledge of the #include hierarchy .
To make this work we need to understand how GCC tracks location information in the AST .
Storing file / line / column information with each tree node would require too much memory so instead GCC stores an instance of the location_t type ( currently defined as unsigned int ) in tree nodes .
The location_t values consist of three bit - fields : the index into the line map , line offset , and column number .
The line map stores entries that represent continuous file fragments , that is , file fragments that are not interrupted by #include directives .
Line map entries contain information such as the file name and start line position .
Using the location_t value one can look up the line map entry and get the file name , line number ( start line plus offset ) and column number .
One property of the location_t values that we are going to exploit is that values for locations further down in the translation unit have greater values .
As a result we can create the following container that will automatically keep declarations that we insert into it in the source code order :
struct decl_comparator { bool operator ( ) ( tree x , tree y ) const { location_t xl ( DECL_SOURCE_LOCATION ( x ) ) ; location_t yl ( DECL_SOURCE_LOCATION ( y ) ) ; return xl < yl ; } } ; typedef std::multiset < tree , decl_comparator > decl_set ;
Now we can implement the collect ( ) function which adds all the declarations into the set :
void collect ( tree ns , decl_set& set ) { tree decl ; cp_binding_level * level ( NAMESPACE_LEVEL ( ns ) ) ; // Collect declarations . // for ( decl = level - > names ; decl != 0 ; decl = TREE_CHAIN ( decl ) ) { if ( DECL_IS_BUILTIN ( decl ) ) continue ; set.insert ( decl ) ; } // Traverse namespaces . // for ( decl = level -> namespaces ; decl != 0 ; decl = TREE_CHAIN ( decl ) ) { if ( DECL_IS_BUILTIN ( decl ) ) continue ; collect ( decl , set ) ; } }
The new traverse ( ) implementation will then look like this :
void traverse ( tree ns ) { decl_set set ; collect ( ns , set ) ; for ( decl_set : : iterator i ( set.begin ( ) ) , e ( set.end ( ) ) ; i != e ; ++i ) { print_decl ( * i ) ; } }
If we now run this new implementation of our plugin on the C++ fragment presented earlier , we will get the following output :
function_decl f at test.cxx : 1 type_decl c at test.cxx : 5 type_decl t at test.cxx : 8 var_decl v at test.cxx:9
Note that now we do n’t track namespace declaration nodes since they are merged into one anyway .
If you need to recreate the original namespace hierarchy , the best approach is to use the namespace information that can be inferred from declaration nodes using the CP_DECL_CONTEXT macro .
For example , the following function returns the namespace name for a declaration :
std :: string decl_namespace ( tree decl ) { string s , tmp ; for ( tree scope ( CP_DECL_CONTEXT ( decl ) ) ; scope != global_namespace ; scope = CP_DECL_CONTEXT
( scope ) ) { tree id ( DECL_NAME ( scope ) ) ; tmp = " : : " ; tmp += ( id != 0 ? IDENTIFIER_POINTER
( id ) : " < unnamed > " ) ; tmp += s ; s.swap ( tmp ) ; } return s ; }
And that ’s it for today .
If you have any questions or comments , you are welcome to leave them below .
The complete source code for the plugin we have developed in this post is available as the plugin - 2.cxx file ( it is fun to try to run it on some real C++ source files ) .
In the next post we will talk about types ( * _TYPE tree codes ) and in particular how to traverse classes .
Thousands of years ago , there once stood a place called Punt , a land of gold and ebony , and ivory , frankincense and myrrh .
To the pharaohs who built their palaces along the Nile , the Land of Punt was the source of great treasure .
Among the most prized were Punt 's leopards and baboons , which they viewed as sacred and took as royal pets .
The pharaohs sent great expeditions to Punt ; they welcomed delegations of Puntites to their palaces , and their scribes recorded their gifts and commercial products in detail .
But not one of the Egyptian scribes who wrote about the strange land - Ta netjer , or God 's Land , as it was sometimes called - ever revealed exactly where it lay .
The riddle was left to modern - day scholars to solve .
Now researchers armed with the sophisticated tools of modern physics have tackled the problem and declared that while they still can't tell exactly where Punt was , they do know where it was n't .
Disputes over Punt 's location have gone on for decades .
Punt ( pronounced Poont ) , archaeologists have said , was in Mozambique , or Somalia ; or on the Sinai Peninsula or in Yemen , or somewhere in Western Asia where Israel , Lebanon and Syria now lie .
Narrowing the search
At a recent meeting in Oakland of the American Research Center in Egypt three scientists announced with confidence they had ruled out all of those five locations , and there was no disagreement from the 300 archaeologists there .
The Land of Punt , the scientist said , must have existed in eastern North Africa - either in the region where Ethiopia and Eritrea confront each other , or east of the Upper Nile in a lowland area of eastern Sudan .
The three experts , all specialists in arcane disciplines , were :
-- Nathaniel J. Dominy , a UC Santa Cruz anthropologist and primate ecologist who studies the lives and habitats of apes , baboons and other monkeys , as well as human evolution ;
-- Gillian Leigh Moritz , a specialist in manipulating the mass spectrometer in Dominy 's laboratory to analyze the stable isotopes of oxygen and other elements ;
-- Kathryn A. Bard , a Boston University Egyptologist who for nearly 10 years has been excavating the ancient Red Sea harbor of Wadi Gawassis , where royal sailing expeditions were sent to Punt and returned with precious cargo .
The key to solving the mystery of Punt was Dominy 's intimate knowledge of baboon geography - there are five species of the animals , and Dominy can identify the African regions where each one has its specialized habitat .
He also knows the characteristics of the body tissue of each species .
" We used baboons as a lens to solve the Punt problem , " he said .
" They were among the most important commodities brought back to the pharaohs from Punt , but until now no one has known where those baboons came from . "
The British Museum in London 's collection of Egyptian antiquities holds two mummified baboons that were once gifts from Punt to the pharaohs , and although museum officials would not allow Dominy to drill into the mummies for bone samples to analyze their DNA , he was allowed to snip a few precious hairs from the baboons for Moritz to work on .
Clues in the water
Despite their age , those hairs still contained trace molecules of the water the animals drank when alive , and Moritz could analyze that water to determine the ratio of two oxygen isotopes in the hairs .
It 's a complicated bit of chemistry , but every oxygen atom is made up of three different stable isotopes - their atomic masses - and the ratio between two of them , oxygen - 16 and oxygen - 18 , varies significantly in the rainfall and humidity from one part of the world to another , even from different parts of a continent .
Moritz used her mass spectrometer in the Dominy lab to determine the oxygen isotope ratios in the hairs of each mummified baboon , and compared them with the ratios in all five species of baboons living in varied parts of Africa today .
" The results of the mass spectrometer showed us that the region of Ethiopia and Eritrea was the place to look for Punt , " she said .
Bard , the Boston University Egyptologist , said the findings are convincing and make Punt more real than ever , but she suggests that the land might also have existed in a similar nearby baboon region - perhaps in eastern Sudan .
Remains of ships
The ancient harbor on the Red Sea where Bard is excavating is called Mersa / Wadi Gawassis , and Bard 's excavations have yielded well - preserved ship 's timbers , anchors , coils of ancient rope , and the rigging of seagoing ships that date from the reigns of several Pharaonic dynasties .
From that port , a pharaoh named Amenhotep IV sent a major expedition to Punt some 3,800 years ago during the eighth year of his reign , Bard and her colleagues have discovered .
" We 've made a wonderful find there , " Bard said .
" It was really amazing - 40 cargo boxes from the ship , and some were inscribed with the name of that very king , the name of the scribe , and the inscribed words , ' wonderful things from Punt . ' "
A source close to Yahoo's strategic planning recently complained to us that Yahoo has " a fundamental innovator 's dilemma . "
What he meant is that while Yahoo has flat traffic , flat revenues , and increasingly limited growth opportunities , it can't innovate it's way out of the problem with bold new products because it has to fund , protect , and iterate on " a big existing business that is , let 's face it , very profitable " -- display advertising on Yahoo.com and the company 's other media sites .
So while there is , at Yahoo , " a core group of people who still want [ and ] believe that Yahoo can change things , " these product directors and line engineers increasingly find themselves working not for a tech company , but for a media company content to serve ad impressions against an already huge Web audience .
Right now , this " innovator 's dilemma " is mostly a mild inconvenience that makes
Yahoo a less fun place for Silicon Valley engineers and executives to work ( which is why so many are quitting ) .
But someday soon , it could kill the company .
That 's because Yahoo's entire big , existing , profitable business is dependent on consumers continuing to use the Internet and the " Web " the way they are right now for the foreseeable future .
That may be a bad bet .
Just ask Google , which is cranking out $ 25 billion a year on desktop search , but is scrambling to develop a mobile business anyway .
Ask Apple , which used to just make Macs , but now calls itself a mobile devices maker .
Or ask our source close to Yahoo who believes " the Web is on a verge of a tectonic shift " and that " the [ Web ] page as a dominate paradigm is going away . "
Our source believes this upcoming " tectonic shift " presents an opportunity for Yahoo to " leverage and benefit from the next disruption . "
We agree .
But first Yahoo has to solve its " innovator 's dilemma . "
Here are four possible solutions Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz and Yahoo's historically inept board of directors could pursue :
Seek a leveraged buyout lead by a large private equity firm such as KKR or Blackstone .
In theory , this would allow Yahoo to ignore the quarter - by - quarter scrutiny that forces it to protect its display business above all else and re-invest in innovation .
To do it it , a PE firm would have to borrow about $ 30 billion .
The problem is PE firms typically buy a company because they believe they can " strip mine " it down to a single , healthy business and then sell it back to the public as a more efficient machine .
That does n't sound a like a recipe for innovation to us .
Finally , remember when Terra Firma acquired record label EMI in hopes of figuring out the Internet ?
That was a big nasty old bust .
Sell 20 % or more of the company to a mid-stage private equity firm , such as Digital Sky Technologies , Elevation Partners , or whomever else Quincy Smith and CODE Advisers could con into the gig .
The new part - owners could kick Carol upstairs into the chairmanship and bring in a product - oriented chief executive , who , unlike the last one ( cofounder Jerry Yang ) is also able to make decisions .
The problem with this option is that it requires co-operation from Carol and the board .
Also , it assumes shareholders will provide Yahoo some leash after the deal .
The other problem is that the model to follow here is Palm , which brought on a ton of Apple execs after Elevation Partners invested .
That experiment failed .
Buy Zynga and put Mark Pincus in charge .
We 've heard Facebook gamesmaker Zynga is cranking out $ 1 million of revenue a day , putting it at annual run rate well over $ 350 million selling virtual goods that make its games easier to play .
That 's ridiculous , and it's happening thanks to three factors :
Facebook 's rapidly growing audience ( over 200 million people check the site each day )
Consumers ' willingness to pay small amounts of money to make the games they 've been using for years to divert themselves slightly easier .
Zynga CEO
Mark Pincus 's relentless focus on building products that people will actually love to use .
( Seriously , the guy will kill a product if there 's any doubt about its popularity . )
None of those factors go away if Zynga merges with Yahoo .
Yahoo has as much scale as Facebook , and its demographics align nicely with Zynga's .
From the deal , Yahoo would get a product focused CEO , a toe - hold in the developing Facebook ecosystem , and -- here 's the exciting part -- an overwhelming amount of immediate transactional volume in case it ever decided to launch a " Pay With Yahoo " product that could someday rival PayPal .
The problem with this deal is that Zynga has plenty of money , little desire to sell , and patient investors .
Give up on innovation and merge with AOL .
Limited innovation is only a dilemma if the company 's future depends on innovation .
It 's a tech company problem .
Maybe Yahoo is a media company .
If that 's the case , it needs to focus on increasing scale and cutting costs .
The best and most immediate way to do that is to merge with AOL , keep the winning media properties from both sides , and cut all the redundant human resources between them ( starting with ad sales ) .
The best person to run this company is a champion salesman like current AOL CEO Tim Armstrong .
Whomever 's in charge of the Miley Cyrus empire at Disney would n't be a bad hire , either .
Do n't miss : The Real Reason Top Yahoo Execs Keep Quitting
White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel ’s plan to hold his son’s bar mitzvah at the historic Western Wall in Jerusalem has run into problems from two different directions .
On one hand , according to ABC News , the site lies within the Old City of Jerusalem , which the United States considers to be occupied territory .
US officials are discouraged from spending time there except in an official capacity .
ADVERTISEMENT
But an even more serious issue may be a threat by right - wing Israeli extremists to metaphorically “ blow up ” the celebration .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We promise to accompany your sonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s bar mitzvah events in Israel , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  they wrote to Emanuel , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ we will make sure to receive you as you deserve to be received Ã¢â‚¬â€ not with flowers and candy , but with catcalls and disgust at what you represent .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
It appears that Itamar Ben Gvir and Baruch Marzel , who object to President Barack Obama ’s opposition to the expansion of illegal settlements on the West Bank , may have been taking lessons in harassment from the Westboro Baptist Church , a homophobic and “ virulently anti-Semitic ” group best known for picketing the funerals of American soldiers .
“ Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ I think he is worse than Hamas , ” Ben Gvir said of Emanuel .
“ If the kid would come alone to the Wall without his father , we would be happy and we would nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t complain .
But with all that Rahm Emanuel has done against the People of Israel and Land of Israel , we would have no choice but to demonstrate .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Ben Gvir is a spokesman for the Jewish National Front .
Last year he led a march in Israel ’s largest Arab city that degenerated into violence , and in 2008 , he explicitly refused to denounce an attempt to assassinate a Israeli professor who had spoken out against the settlements .
Marzel , the leader of the Jewish National Front , was formerly the spokesman for the late Rabbi Meir Kahane , whose Kach organization was outlawed as a terrorist group in both the United States and Israel .
According to ABC , the Emanuels ’ plans are now in doubt .
Rahm ’s father , Benjamin , told the Jerusalem Post that he “ cannot make any statement . ”
The Montreal Canadiens do n't yet know their opponent for the Eastern Conference final , but the NHL has confirmed that the team will face off for Game 1 on Sunday evening .
The Canadiens will play at 7 p.m. ET ( CBC , CBCSports.ca ) , the second of two playoff games on Sunday .
Montreal , as the eighth seed , will begin in either Philadelphia or Boston .
The Flyers have forced a Game 7 in Boston on Friday in the conference semifinal by beating the Bruins three straight times to even the series .
Montreal should have motivation regardless of whom they eventually face , as they represent the last two teams to eliminate the Canadiens the past two springs .
Boston and Montreal have met in an NHL record 32 series in the playoffs , with the Bruins coming out on top for just the eighth time last year by sweeping the Canadiens in the first round .
Philadelphia knocked off Montreal in five games in 2008 en route to the conference final .
The franchises have met five times in history , with the Habs winning three series , including the 1976 Stanley Cup final .
The top- seeded Sharks and No. 2 Chicago Blackhawks will begin the Western Conference final with a matinee game at 3 p.m. ET on Sunday in San Jose .
The Sharks will have enjoyed eight days off since the conference semifinals , while the Blackhawks finished their series over Vancouver on Tuesday .
The NHL said it will release the remainder of the schedule for the conference finals on Friday .

Pat ( left ) and Bob Migliore and other Crocus Grove Sun Club members are looking for a new , private location for their nudist group to relax .
Wanted : one campground , for quiet bunch of family - minded campers .
Must feature : a reasonable drive from Winnipeg , a building to become a clubhouse , and some open space to play games .
Oh , and it also needs a place for campers to strip off their skivvies .
" ( Privacy ) is a given for our kind of club , " chuckled John Kundert of the Crocus Grove Sun Club , days after the province 's last nudist organization voted to go ahead with a pioneering decision to buy and operate a new clothing - optional retreat , which could be open as early as the summer .
Two weeks ago , the 40 - year - old club 's affairs were thrown into disarray when Ray and Susan Ryynanen , the owners of its longtime Crocus Grove home , announced they were closing the campground and reopening it as a conventional , clothes - on spot .
But at a meeting on Sunday , the 63 - member sun club took matters into its own hands :
A near - unanimous vote launched the Legacy Project , a club trust fund that will buy and operate a permanent haven for nude sun-seekers .
" It 's very gratifying , and very reassuring that people want to keep the nudism alive in Manitoba , " said club member and former Crocus Grove groundskeeper Bob Miglione .
Kundert said he does n't know of any other nudist clubs that have run their own campgrounds as part of a trust .
But after the recent kerfuffle , the club did n't want to put its home in private hands again .
" It 's a close - knit group , and we want to stay together , " Kundert said , noting that many members have been friends for decades .
" It 's difficult to stay together if we do n't have a place to meet .
And that 's what we 're trying to accomplish here , to find a new place that we can call our home , so we do n't ever have to worry about losing it again . "
Where there 's a will , there 's a wallet : by the end of Sunday 's meeting , members had already pledged half the money needed to buy and open a new property , an amount Kundert could not disclose but described as " a substantial sum . "
Now , the club just needs to find a home , sweet home .
Its needs are minimal ; a perfect property could be 10 acres , or it could be 100 .
All that really matters is that it offers lots of privacy , is about an hour 's drive from the city and has some facilities to get the club started .
Oh , and sandy soil would be a bonus .
Keeps the bugs down , don'tcha know .
" Mosquitoes are always an issue ... especially for nudists , " Kundert laughed .
Hey , who does n't want folks with that kind of sense of humour living down the road ?
If any Manitobans are still a bit iffy on the idea of having nudists as neighbours , Kundert assures his family - oriented club wo n't offend .
" We 're a quiet group .
It 's just the fact that we do everything without clothes on , when weather permits , " Kundert said , noting that Crocus Grove 's intergenerational membership includes grandparents and great - grandparents .
And they 're a neighbourly bunch , even if it means giving people the shirt off their backs ... or , uh , wherever their shirt was at the time .
" We 're actively involved in clothing drives . "

You 're looking at only the second goal not deemed a scoring chance since I started pinch - hitting for Dennis King in tracking Oilers chances this season .
The first was against Jeff Deslauriers , which speaks for itself .
This one , though , came against the goaltender I spent a large portion of the game one post defending , so thank you very much , Evgeni Nabokov .
This screenshot is illustrative , I think , of the process that goes into tracking a scoring chance .
I 've used the same definition of a scoring chance ( see the definition after the jump ) since the beginning of the playoffs and I 've stuck to it as closely as I can , watching all shots directed at the net at least twice and any shots that may be a questionable chance in slow motion , frame - by - frame .
On this play , the NHL official scorer marked Ladd 's shot at 53 feet .
A 53 - foot snap shot from the center of the ice should be saved by the goaltender an extremely high percentage of the time , as it's not in the " dangerous scoring area " from the crease to the dots and into the slot .
There is no element of surprise as the puck was carried in by the shooter , there was no cross - seam pass or one - time shot .
After watching the three replay angles in frame - by - frame , I determined that there was no screen , in fact , Nicolas Wallin actually moved out of the way of the shot as Ladd wound up .
There was no deflection , either from the defender or from another forward in front of the net as Ladd was the first man into the zone .
So the goaltender had an unscreened look at an untouched snap shot from the puck carrier from 53 feet and whiffed .
For the second time in eighteen games , I ruled that a goal was not a scoring chance .
Scoring Chances for game 30322
For those of you who are new to the concept of tracking scoring chances , a scoring chance is defined as a clear play directed toward the opposing net from a dangerous scoring area - loosely defined as the top of the circle in and inside the faceoff dots , though sometimes slightly more generous than that depending on the amount of immediately - preceding puck movement or screens in front of the net .
Blocked shots are generally not included but missed shots are .
A player is awarded a scoring chance anytime he is on the ice and someone from either team has a chance to score .
He is awarded a " chance for " if someone on his team has a chance to score and a " chance against " if the opposing team has a chance to score .
Vic Ferrari makes this all possible with his tools to evaluate Corsi , head - to - head ice time and scoring chances .
I 'm tracking this series with the Sharks as the home team , so in any unlabeled sequence , the first number is for the Sharks , the second for the Blackhawks .

The Sharks again won the battle of the chances as evens and lost the game , this time soundly .
This was n't a case of winning because of game state - the Sharks jumped out to an early chances lead and stayed up the entire game .

After Jonathan
Toews early chance , the Sharks reeled off seven straight chances and were trailing 1 - 0 .
Annti Niemi kept the Hawks in the game once more .
The second period was a bizarre one as there were only six chances total , three on the power play and three at even strength , but there were three goals in the period .

For San Jose , I do n't know if there is much that Todd McClellan can change .
His lines are winning the chances battle and the Corsi is even .
Unless he can cast a spell on Nabokov or turn Thomas Greiss into Olaf Kolzig , circa 1998 , the Sharks are in trouble .
If I were to show these two chances charts with names redacted and asked for a winner , the nearly universal answer would be the Sharks .
Copper & Blue favorite Logan Couture is n't getting a regular shift and has been a non-factor .

The talking heads are really getting caught up in their own story here .
Dave Bolland is getting rave reviews for his work thus far in the series , but he 's been outchanced 3/14 in two games and Kris Versteeg has put up a 4/12 .
This line 's work is so is so good that they should play for the Montreal Canadiens .
I understand what Joel Quenneville is trying to do - he 's freeing up Jonathan Toews by running away from Joe Thornton .
But the point is n't to shut down Thornton - it's to free up Toews .
But if the point is to shut down Thornton , Bolland is doing a miserable job of it and Quenneville should look to some other strategy as soon as possible .
In spite of all of this , it 's been the Troy Brouwer - Marian Hossa - Patrick Sharp line that has done the chances damage in both games .
Brouwer is 6/6 , Sharp is 8/6 , and Hossa is 9/5 so far , mostly against Manny Malhotra 's line .

Dear To Her Credit ,
What happens when your ex-husband , who is currently giving you alimony , files for bankruptcy ?
How does his filing of bankruptcy affect your alimony ?
Will he get out of paying spousal support ? —
Ana
Dear Ana ,
If your husband hopes he can get out of paying you alimony by filing for bankruptcy , he ’s going to be very disappointed .
New York bankruptcy attorney Edward E. Neiger says , “ Child and spousal support , including child support and alimony , are not dischargeable in bankruptcy . ”
In fact , under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 , back child support and alimony must be paid before any other creditor , including taxes owed .
That ’s pretty amazing , but it shows the importance placed on financial support for ex-spouses and children and acknowledgement of the cost to society if that support is not received .
Just because alimony is not dischargeable , however , does n’t mean you should sit back and wait to see what happens .
Neiger recommends that you file a “ nondischargeability complaint ” to make sure your interests remain protected .
Because you are a holder of a domestic support obligation claim , the trustee in the bankruptcy is required by law to notify you — and your state ’s Child Support Enforcement Agency if applicable — of the bankruptcy proceedings .
You should get two notices : one at the time of filing and another at the time of the bankruptcy discharge .
To make sure you get what ’s coming to you , you can hire a lawyer , or you may qualify for low - cost or free legal advice where you live .
When it comes to collecting the money you live on , do n’t try to save money by going without good legal advice .
If your ex does n’t have enough assets that the bankruptcy court can use to pay the back alimony , you may have to accept catch - up payments .
Your lawyer or other legal adviser can help negotiate the amount per month he must pay , as well as how he will make the payments .
After the bankruptcy , assuming your ex has a loss of income or other drastic change in circumstances from when the divorce was settled , he may try to get hardship relief from full alimony payments going forward .
He must go through the courts to get such relief unless your decree had some provision for income fluctuations and periods of unemployment .
In most states , your ex could get an alimony modification by either petitioning the court and having the court determine the new amount , or by coming to an agreement with you and presenting filled - out forms to a judge to approve .
Get good legal advice before you agree to any adjustment to your divorce decree .
If your ex files for bankruptcy , it may actually work in your favor .
If some of his assets are liquidated in the bankruptcy , you may get paid off .
And once he gets rid of some of the other debts he ’s been juggling , he should find it easier to pay you .
On the other hand , maybe when your ex finds out how many of his debts wo n’t be wiped out by bankruptcy , he ’ll decide it ’s not even worth it .
In addition to child support and alimony , he will find that bankruptcy generally does not get him out of back taxes , student loans or debts secured by assets .
Whenever possible , it ’s better to just pay one ’s debts .
Make sure your ex pays his debt to you .

UFO Festival Announcement
McMenamins , in conjunction with the McMinnville Downtown Association , has made the difficult decision to cancel our 2020 UFO Festival , which has been constricted in so many ways by COVID - 19 .
Our plan is to come back bigger and better than ever next May .
So mark your calendars for May 13 – 15 , 2021 , when we ’ll welcome you all back to McMinnville once again .
The dry season is finally arriving in the Top End after the equal hottest May nights on record , the Bureau of Meteorology says .
May has been unseasonally wet and humid but a cool dry change this morning saw the temperature drop to 22 degrees .
The bureau 's Todd Smith says it will be even colder tonight .
" In fact , tonight we 're going for the first minimum to dip below 20 degrees for the year , " he said .
" That 's always a good sign that the dry season is arriving and people need to air out their doonas to cope with the 19 degree temperature . "
Mr Smith says even with the cool change , May will equal the warmest on record .
" In terms of night - time temperatures , it 's been equal warmest ever , he said .
The last time we averaged 24.3 overnight was May 1978 .
In terms of rainfall , it 's been the wettest May since 1997 so it 's been quite unusual in terms of humidity .
It 's been the most humid May since 1968 .
Although President Obama ’s vision for NASA ’s future calls for canceling the Constellation program that was intended to send humans to the moon by 2020 , his proposed budget for the agency still holds opportunities for future space research and urges NASA to develop the technology to enable human spaceflight to locations like Mars that are beyond low - Earth orbit .
Several MIT researchers have been intrigued by one item in the proposal that they hope Obama will elaborate on during today ’s policy speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida : extending operations of the International Space Station ( ISS ) past its planned retirement in 2016 .
According to Obama ’s proposal , keeping the ISS operational would allow NASA and other nations ’ space agencies to deploy new research facilities there , such as a centrifuge , which simulates the effects of gravity by spinning .
Equipping the space station with a centrifuge would give scientists a valuable opportunity to test whether the device can offset some of the negative side effects of zero gravity , according to Justin Kaderka , a graduate student in MIT ’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics , who has studied the effectiveness of artificial gravity .
Without gravity , bone loses essential minerals , muscles atrophy and the cardiovascular system weakens .
Since the 1960s , artificial gravity has been discussed as a way to keep astronauts healthy during long - duration trips to places like Mars , which would take three years .
Creating artificial gravity in space can be achieved either by using a “ long - range centrifuge ” in which a large spacecraft rotates continuously or a “ short - range centrifuge ” in which a person is attached to a spinning structure for intermittent periods .
In either scenario , the spinning motion creates an acceleration field that mimics the effects of gravity on the human body .
For nearly two years , Kaderka has worked with Laurence Young , the Apollo Program Professor of Astronautics and a professor of health sciences and technology , to understand how artificial gravity compares to traditional countermeasures , such as resistance training and aerobic exercises done on treadmills and cycling machines .
Although these methods are currently tested on the ISS , astronauts continue to experience weakening of the bone , muscle and cardiovascular systems upon their return .
Artificial gravity could be an effective countermeasure to deconditioning of a variety of human physiological systems because it supplies the missing stimulus — gravity — before significant weakening can occur .
“ Artificial gravity is unique because it goes to the source of the problem , unlike other methods that are designed to counter the deconditioning of individual physiological systems , ” says Kaderka , who reviewed the results of more than 75 experiments done over the past 40 years on ways to counter the physical losses caused by prolonged weightlessness .
In a thesis that will be published in May , Kaderka concludes from his review that artificial gravity works just as well as traditional countermeasures at treating the adverse effects of long - term weightlessness on the cardiovascular system , especially when combined with other aerobic exercises .
As for artificial gravity ’s effects on muscle and bone , however , Kaderka suggests that much more research is needed .
William Paloski , a professor of space science at the University of Houston , values Kaderka ‘s analysis for organizing a “ hodgepodge of test objectives and findings , ” noting that the work sets the stage for a “ knowledge - driven coordinated approach ” to future studies that could lead to successful gravity therapies for missions .
The meta-analysis
Although Kaderka ’s “ meta- analysis ” tries to provide a scientific basis for future experiments , he acknowledges that the data are limited because so few deconditioning studies involving artificial gravity have been done on Earth .
These experiments are expensive because they require subjects to be bedridden for several weeks in order to mimic the deconditioning that astronauts experience in space .
Specifically , Kaderka compared the results of nearly 35 artificial - gravity deconditioning studies ( including some done on animals ) to those from about 40 experiments that tested traditional countermeasures .
Taking into consideration differences between studies , such as their duration , Kaderka drew comparisons between studies that had consistency across certain variables , such as which physiological systems were assessed .
Based on data about subjects ’ maximum rate of oxygen uptake and tolerance to cardiovascular stress , among other parameters , he concludes that artificial gravity is just as effective as other countermeasures in offsetting cardiovascular deconditioning .
But because there have been so few bed - rest studies that examined the effects of artificial gravity on muscle or bone , Kaderka was unable to make the same conclusion about artificial gravity for those systems .
Not if , but when
Kaderka and Young acknowledge that even if a centrifuge is put on the ISS , much more ground - based research on artificial gravity will be needed to determine certain unknown variables , such as the amount of time or at what speed a person needs to be spun on a centrifuge for its use to be effective .
They say that having the ISS centrifuge could provide hard evidence that artificial gravity is a viable countermeasure , which might lead to NASA funding more Earth - based experiments .
According to Young , who submitted a proposal through the Japanese Space Agency to deploy a centrifuge on the ISS months ago , it will take researchers years to quantify the effectiveness of artificial gravity , which is why NASA ’s plans should include both Earth and space experiments as soon as possible so that the agency is prepared to use the countermeasure when it decides to conduct long - duration flights .
“ It ’s not a question of if , but when , NASA makes that decision , ” says Young , explaining that after NASA ’s proposed robotic exploration of Mars and faraway asteroids , astronauts will need to travel to and explore those surfaces .
The Secrets Of Cloth Simulation In Alan Wake
By Henrik Enqvist
[ Remedy animation programmer Henrik Enqvist takes a look at how the team created a believable tweed cloth simulation on the title character 's jacket in the Microsoft - published Xbox 360 exclusive horror - thriller Alan Wake . ]
The main character in our action thriller is Alan Wake , a writer who gets trapped in a nightmarish scenario where he is forced to fight dark forces while trying to solve the mystery of his missing wife .
He is not a well - trained action hero , but rather an everyday guy .
To establish his character our art director wanted him to wear an old tweed jacket with arm patches .
As the game takes place in a real - world setting , the tools for giving characters personality are limited , compared to a fantasy game or a space shooter .
Therefore the clothes that our characters wear become far more important .
Alan Wake 's jacket had to be as believable as possible to maintain the illusion of a thriller atmosphere to the player .
The jacket needs to move in the wind and add a nice secondary motion to the character as he rushes through the forest .
As a programmer , you immediately start to think about a cloth simulation .
A lot of games before us had already shipped with cloth simulation , but often those methods gave the impression of either silk or rubber -- something that we did n't want .
Just recently , some very good third party solutions for cloth simulation have shipped , but at the point when we needed to have a stable solution such tools did n't exist , or did n't serve our needs .
This article will take a look at the challenges we encountered and present the solutions for rolling our own cloth simulation .
Even if you are familiar with the methods described here , the way we put things together should make for some interesting reading .
The Jacket Rig
The jacket was modeled together with the rest of the character as a regular skinned mesh .
The bones driving the jacket mesh are a separate layer on top of the normal skeleton .
The sleeves of the jacket use the normal upper and lower arm setup .
Both upper and lower arms are split into one main bone and one twist bone .
The upper jacket is driven by look - at constraints and a Verlet simulation drives the lower jacket .
Figure 1 .
The jacket rig on top of the regular game skeleton .
The Upper Jacket
The jacket bones are parented top - down so that when the upper bones move the lower bones will follow .
We were tempted to parent the lower bones straight to the thorax , but that would have caused us to lose motion -- especially the vertical motion in the jacket when the character raises his shoulders .
In the upper jacket , we mimic the motion of real shoulder pads by driving the shoulder bones with look - at constraints towards spots on the upper arms .
This way the shoulder pad will follow the upper arm and when the arm is raised the shoulder pad will lift the rest of the bones -- just as a real jacket .
The following bones in the chain are a layer between the upper jacket and the simulated lower jacket .
These bones are driven by look - at constraints straight down so that they compensate for the rotation that the shoulders cause .
We also added position constraints between the left and the right bone to compensate for the stretching that occurs when the shoulder pads move .
Figure 2 .
The bones move when character raises his arm .
It might have been a good enough solution to implement the constraints in the animation exporter and bake the results into the animation data , but we still opted for driving the bones in real - time inside the game engine .
This way we could save a few bytes in the animation data and we were also able to easily share animations between characters regardless whether they were wearing jackets or not .
Also the shoulder movement generated by in - game IK ( e.g. when aiming ) became correctly applied when solving the constraints in real - time .
The Lower Jacket
After the upper jacket is solved we take a look at simulating the lower part of the jacket .
Most cloth simulations in games have a one - to - one mapping between the vertices in a cloth simulation and the vertices in the rendered mesh .
In our case we wanted to preserve the fidelity of the jacket mesh and not have it held back by any coder - dictated constraints .
For example , the silhouette of the pockets and the front part of the jacket would have been lost if we would have settled for a having the same mesh for simulation as for rendering .
Normal maps could have been utilized to give shape to the jacket but we felt that this was n't enough .
Instead we wanted our artists to freely shape the jacket anyway they wanted and then allow them to use the normal maps to add wrinkles or other detail instead of making up for lost geometry .
Our solution to this was to have a low - resolution cloth mesh used for simulating the jacket and then map that to the bones in the skeleton that was used for driving the skinned mesh .
Figure 3 .
The silhouette of our jacket vs. one that shares vertices with simulation .
Verlet physics
First we will take a look at the Verlet physics and then later on see how we map the simulation back to the bones .
Verlet physics is currently the standard for solving cloth simulations in games .
If you are not familiar with Verlet I recommend you to first read either of these Gamasutra features : Devil in the Blue Faceted Dress : Real Time Cloth Animation or Advanced Character Physics .
Figure 4 . A 4x4 grid of vertices and the constraints for one of the vertices .
For the rest of us I 'll just give a short recap of how it works .
Figure 4 shows a cloth mesh and the spring constraints for one of the vertices .
As shown in the figure , each vertex in the mesh is connected to all neighboring vertices as well as their neighbors .
Constraints to immediate neighbors are called stretch constraints and shown in blue .
The longer constraints , shown in red , are called shear / bend constraints .
It is important to keep these constraints in two groups because we will later solve them with different parameters .
Note that in our jacket the top row of the cloth will be skinned to the character and not driven by the simulation .
Having a grid - like mesh is not a requirement by the algorithm itself , however , for cloth simulation this topology is the easiest to work with .
The heart of the cloth simulation consists of two parts .
The first part is the Verlet integration where we for each vertex calculate the velocity and apply it to the position .
Vector3 vVelocity = vertex.vCurrentPosition - vertex.vPreviousPosition ;
vertex.vPreviousPosition = vertex.vCurrentPosition ;
vertex.vCurrentPosition += vVelocity * ( 1.0 f - fDampingFactor ) + vAcceleration * fDeltaTime * fDeltaTime ;
In our project vAcceleration was given by the sum of gravity and wind .
Damping is used for both tweaking the looks of the jacket as well as making the simulation stable .
A high damping factor gives the jacket a feel of having a very light fabric which slowly and softly settles while a small damping factor will make the jacket heavier and keep it swinging / vibrating longer after a motion .
The second part of the algorithm involves solving the spring constraints ( known as relaxation ) .
For each constraint we move the vertices towards or away from each other so that they satisfy their original lengths .
Here is the code snippet in human - readable form .
Vector3 vDelta = constraint.m_vertex1.m_vCurPos - constraint.m_vertex0.m_vCurPos ;
float fLength = vDelta.length ( ) ;
vDelta.normalize ( ) ;
Vector3 vOffset = vDelta * ( fLength - constraint.m_fRestLength ) ;
constraint.m_vertex0.m_vCurrentPosition += vOffset / 2.0f ;
constraint.m_vertex1.m_vCurrentPosition -= vOffset / 2.0f ;
The stretch constraints will keep the cloth together while the shear / bend constraints will help keeping the shape of the cloth .
As you can see solving this system perfectly will result in a cloth that moves rigidly .
That is why we will be adding a coefficient to the shear / bend constraints before solving the new positions .
vOffset *= fStiffness ;
constraint.m_vertex0.m_vCurrentPosition += vOffset / 2.0f ;
constraint.m_vertex1.m_vCurrentPosition -= vOffset / 2.0f ;
A stiffness factor of 1.0 will lead to a rigid cloth , while 0.0 will give you cloth that bends without any restrictions .
Fixed Time Step
You might already have noticed that the Verlet integration assumes that the previous time step is the same as the current one , otherwise the calculated velocity will not be correct .
It is possible to get away with a variable time step when using Verlet integration but the constraint solving will not be as forgiving to changes in time step .
Because the solver works by iterating over the constraints you will see that the constraints will never be solved perfectly .
In a game this inaccuracy will be visible as stretching and the shorter your time step is the less stretching you will see .
In the end this will be a trade off on how much CPU time you are willing to spend on the cloth .
If the time step is not constant the stretching of the cloth will vary and we will introduce some unwanted oscillation into our system .
More important is that the time step will affect the stiffness factor and other parameters of the cloth , a shorter time step will by nature give you a more rigid cloth even if you are using the same stiffness factor .
In practice this means that you will have to settle for a fixed time step before starting to tweak the looks using your cloth parameters .
I know that there are games out there that have a variable step time for physics but my personal experience tells me that your life will be a lot easier if the time step for physics as well as the game logic is fixed .
The Hood
Before diving into the details of the cloth simulation we take a quick look at how the hood was simulated .
We used one extra bone for skinning the vertices of the hood mesh .
We create a pendulum from the center of the bone to a position behind the hood .
The end of the pendulum is a single particle driven by Verlet physics .
The bone is then targeted with a look - at constraint towards the pendulum .
Figure 5 . Hood and pendulum .
Creating the bone matrices
The hood gives us a hint about what we need to do next for our lower jacket .
We are going to utilize the positions of the vertices in the simulated mesh to calculate the transforms for the bones .
The first thing we do is to match up the bones so that each bone pivot matches a vertex in the simulated mesh .
This way it will be trivial to set the translation part of the matrix .
Next we will need to calculate the 3x3 rotation matrix .
Each row ( or column depending on your matrix setup ) in the matrix is given by the x- , y- and z - axis of the bone .
We define the x-axis of the bone to be the direction from the base vertex to the next one below it .
The y - axis is then given by the vector from the vertex on the left to the vertex on the right .
Figure 6 . Bones attached to the cloth mesh .
In figure 6 the x-axis is shown in red and the y - axis is shown in green .
The z - axis is then computed as the cross product between these .
At the end we also ortho - normalize the matrix to get rid of the skewing in the transform .
As you can see , in vertical direction we use each row ( except the last ) of the cloth mesh for the bone setup , but in horizontal direction we only use every second column .
In addition to the artistic benefits described earlier , this is a fairly fast method .
This way , traditional skinning techniques can be used on the GPU side to render the mesh while the alternative would have been to update a large dynamic vertex buffer .
The cloth mesh can have a fairly low resolution , which will make it easier for the CPU .
The only overhead in our solution is the conversion from the low - resolution simulation to the high - resolution mesh , but with our setup the overhead will be negligible compared to the rest of the simulation .
Collisions
For solving the clipping of the cloth against the legs and the body we use ellipsoid vs. particle collision detection .
Figure 7 shows the ellipsoids needed to solve the jacket clipping against the character .
Figure 7 . Ellipsoid setup for Wake .
Ellipsoids are very fast for collision detection against particles .
Collisions can be solved by transforming the space the ellipsoid and the particle live , so that the ellipsoid becomes a sphere .
Then we can apply a fast sphere vs. particle collision test .
In practice this is accomplished by creating an inverse transform using the ellipsoids length , width and height values and applying it to the particle 's position .
The only problem with this is that the collision normal we get after transforming back to our original coordinate system is skewed .
We decided that we could live with a little bit of inaccuracy when solving the direction of the collision .
In cases where a heavily stretched ellipsoid would have caused too bad response , we split it into two more uniform ones .
Max Particle Distance
Another problem to solve is the stability of the jacket .
A cloth in rapid motion might cause knots or end up at the wrong side of the collision volumes and clip through the body .
We solve this by defining a safety distance for each vertex in the simulated cloth .
For each vertex the original rest position is skinned to the closest bone and we use that as the reference point .
If the simulation exceeds the threshold we simply move the vertex closer to the reference point .
In our setup we allowed the vertices at the bottom to move more than the vertices closer to the shoulders .
The max distance we could allow our vertices to move was around 40 cm before rare cases of knots and clipping started to occur .
We also tried other techniques such as collision planes but the max distance method was by far the best method .
It was fast , simple to set up , and allowed for most motion before causing visual errors in the cloth .
More Like Tweed , Less Like Rubber
So far we have come a nice way towards achieving our goals .
Our artist has modeled the jacket so that it pleases him ; no animator is needed to animate the jacket , as everything is simulated in - game , and the CPU is happy because we can use the processing power for other game - related things as well .
There is one thing bothering us though -- it looks like rubber .
Fighting Stretching
First , we want to get rid of the stretching .
As said earlier , the stretching phenomenon is caused by the errors introduced by the iterative nature of the algorithm .
This is a popular topic for research and you will find various methods for solving this .
Unfortunately , all available solutions would have required us to allocate a whole lot more of our precious CPU to the cloth .
Instead , we solved stretching by adding one last step to the cloth simulation where we introduced something we called " hard constraints " .
We defined hard constraints to be all stretch constraints that are vertical .
We sorted these constraints top - down so that constraints near the shoulders would be solved before constraints down at the legs .
Because we iterate the constraints in correct order we know that the upper vertex in the pair is already solved and does n't cause any stretching , thus , we only needed to move the lower one towards the upper vertex .
This way we can be assured that after a single iteration the length from top to down is exactly the same as the length in the rest position .
Vector3 vDelta = constraint.m_vertexTop.m_vCurPos - constraint.m_vertexDown.m_vCurPos ;
float fLength = vDelta.length ( ) ;
vDelta.normalize ( ) ;
Vector3 vOffset = vDelta * ( fLength - constraint.m_fRestLength ) ;
constraint.m_vertexDown.m_vCurrentPosition += vOffset ;
Figure 8 . Hard constraints .
As you can see we do n't take into account the horizontal stretching of the jacket .
It is not possible to add hard constraints in horizontal direction because that would cause a vertex to be solved twice , which would mean that we lose the results of the vertical fix up stage and no longer preserve the rest length .
Anyway , we noticed that for a jacket , horizontal stretching actually goes unnoticed by the human eye , while vertical stretching makes the jacket look really bad .
This solution was good enough .
Jacket Edges
The second thing we wanted was to make the edges of the jacket move a bit more than the rest of the jacket .
For example , when you run with an open jacket you will notice that the air resistance will have a greater effect on the edges of the jacket than the center part .
This is because your body will act as a wind blocker for the rest of the jacket .
The edges can easily be found by counting how many constraints are attached to them , any vertex with less than four stretch constraints is an edge .
Thus , we flag these vertices and simulate them with different parameters like this .
Lower damping factor .
Global wind has a greater effect .
World space motion will have a greater effect ( more on world space motion below ) .
The allowed maximum safety distance is higher .
This way the internal frequency of the edges will be different to the rest of the jacket .
Instead of the whole jacket reacting as a big pendulum to impulses the edges will add a nice secondary motion to the movement .
Figure 9 . Edge vertices .
World Space vs. Local Space motion
Next thing we noticed was that when the character moves around , the world - space motion has a fairly large impact on the simulation while small local body turns or movement in shoulders go unnoticed .
In a traditional cloth simulation the positions of the vertices are simulated in world - space .
One could argue that this is the correct way of simulating cloth , but it just did n't feel right .
So instead we simulated the jacket in the characters local - space and added a small world motion separately .
We saw that 100 % of the local skeleton animation movement together with 10 to 30 percent of world - space movement gave us the results we were looking for .
Friction
A last thing we wanted was to exaggerate the contrast between a jacket in low - motion and a jacket in high - motion .
When Alan was walking we wanted the jacket to be fairly calm and then have more vivid jacket motion for the occasions where he dodged or jumped .
We thought that when the jacket is in contact with the body it should move less because of the friction between the jacket and the shirt and then when the jacket lifts it should have greater motion as it can move freely .
We faked this by using a higher damping value for each vertex that was touching an ellipsoid .
This way , vertices that are in contact with the body will feel a bit sticky , giving us just enough contrast between a jacket in a casual situation compared to one in fast motion .
Conclusion and Further Work
The first incarnation of the cloth simulation was fairly simple to achieve by searching for the word " cloth " in game development literature and applying the algorithms found .
The second phase of getting the look and feel of the jacket to a state where it was good enough for our quality bar involved browsing through academic papers , a lot of trial and error , and even a few lines of scrapped code .
Naturally there is room for improvement .
One example is using that a low - resolution simulation in addition to mapping to a high - resolution mesh makes it hard to solve all clipping perfectly .
Other small features that did n't make it in time were wrinkle maps where the jacket folds , or allowing a tornado to wildly throw the jacket around .
In the end the effort was well worth it , as our cloth clearly differentiates from cloth simulations in other games .
It looks a lot more like tweed than silk or rubber .
Our setup also proved to be very flexible when it came to simulating other fabrics , for example the down jacket of Barry Wheeler and the veil for an old lady were simulated with the same system .
The looks of the different fabrics were easily accomplished by tweaking the parameters .

Last - minute maneuvering in the Senate allowed the Federal Reserve to sidestep legislation that would have exposed its interest - rate decision - making to congressional auditors .
Pressure from the Obama administration led Senate lawmakers to alter a provision pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I. , Vt. ) that was gaining momentum despite opposition from the Treasury and the Fed .
It would have largely repealed a 32 - year - old law that shields Fed monetary policy from congressional auditors .
The compromise , endorsed by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd ( D. , Conn . ) and the Treasury , would require the Fed to disclose more details about its lending during the financial crisis .
It would also require a one - time audit of those loans and a one - time review of Fed governance .
A formal vote was pushed back until next week .
Thursday 's Senate showdown came after senators on the left and right joined forces to support Mr. Sanders ' provision .
" At a time when our entire financial system almost collapsed , we cannot let the Fed operate in secrecy any longer , " Mr. Sanders said .
" The American people have a right to know . "
It ’s been called “ the most tolerated tragedy . ”

A state law that requires power plants , factories and other businesses to cut greenhouse gas emissions could cause energy prices to rise and prompt businesses to delay expansion or flee California , according to a study by the state Legislative Analyst ’s Office .
The landmark global warming law , which is being enforced in phases , could put the state ’s businesses at a competitive disadvantage unless other states and the federal government come up with similar plans , the study by the nonpartisan agency said .
“ Economic leakage ” could occur as businesses move to states with lower regulatory costs , the report said .
Industries that rely heavily on energy use and trade , such as aluminum , chemical or steel producers , could be disproportionately vulnerable .
The California Jobs Initiative said Tuesday that the state ’s “ go- it - alone approach ” would destroy as many as 1.1 million jobs .
The coalition , which includes trade groups , politicians and advocacy groups , has a proposition planned for the November ballot that would delay implementation of the law until the state ’s 12.6 % unemployment rate declines .
Some proponents of the law bashed the report , saying that the study did not weigh the economic benefits of the Global Warming Solutions Act , known as AB 32 .
It has helped generate thousands of jobs and attracted billions of dollars in clean technology investments , according to an advocacy group , Californians for Clean Energy and Jobs .
“ As other states and the federal government waffle about their commitment to renewable energy and technologies , California has become and remains the cradle of this fast - growing industry , ” said Tom Soto , managing partner of Los Angeles - based Craton Equity Partners , which invests in clean technology companies .
The boost in green jobs created by focusing on environmentally friendly practices could offset some of the economic damage , according to the report , which was prepared at the request of Assemblyman Dan Logue ( R - Marysville ) .
Although the state ’s economy could take a hit in the short term , it is so large that the “ adverse impacts likely will be relatively modest ” in the long run , the report said .

By By Bill Lindner May 21 , 2010 in Politics EPA criminal investigator Scott West spent thousands of hours investigating alleged crimes committed by BP -- bound to have resulted in felony charges -- but President Bush 's Department of Justice abruptly shut his investigation down , TruthOut reports .
According to a report by Jason Leopold for As Leopold writes ,
West reportedly spent thousands of hours investigating the alleged crimes committed by BP and thought his investigation would result in felony charges against BP and the company 's senior executives .
Why ?
Supposedly BP execs ignored employees who worked at the Alaska facility .
West , who spent nearly two decades at the EPA 's criminal division , was also told the pipeline was going to rupture - about six months before it happened , Leopold writes .
Suddenly , President Bush 's Department of Justice ( DoJ ) abruptly killed his investigation in August 2007 and gave BP a " slap on the wrist " for serious environmental crimes that should have sent some BP executives to prison , the TruthOut article states .
West transferred from San Francisco to Seattle in the Hamel ran the now - defunct Anwrnews.com , Leopold writes , which was the hub for the whistle - blower 's complaints and an archive showcasing numerous documents related to BP 's shady operations and reckless pursuit of profits .
BP failed to inspect corroded pipeline for eight years
In March 2006 the corroded pipeline burst .
The leak went undetected for nearly a week because detection equipment , as BP employees had warned , malfunctioned .
For about five days , oil spewed from a hole in the pipeline about the size of a pencil eraser .
The leak was discovered when an oilfield worker was surveying the area .
The leak was determined to be caused by " severe corrosion . "
BP had to shut down five oil processing centers in the region for almost two weeks , leading to a spike in gas prices .
West and his team worked with the FBI , the DoJ and Alaska state environmental and regulatory officials , launching a probe into the circumstances behind the spill , Leopold writes .
As the investigation progressed , Plenty of evidence would have led to felony charges TruthOut outlines several of the challenges
West faced : he could n't use the information he and his investigators got from the employees that claimed BP officials knew about the pipeline corrosion prior to the spill .
Sources would not allow their names to be used because they feared retaliation from BP and losing their jobs .
West had to get a grand jury to subpoena them to testify .
As noted in a previous Despite its plea agreement , it appears that BP is still scrimping on safety and maintenance .
Last November , a pipeline at BP's Prudhoe Bay oil field ruptured .
Alaska officials said the rupture was due to an ice buildup inside the pipeline " that caused it to burst under pressure , " Leopold writes in TruthOut .
Lo and behold , criminal and civil investigations were announced immediately , led by West 's former colleagues at the EPA 's criminal division and the FBI .
Tensions between the Obama administration and the scientific community over the Gulf oil spill are reportedly escalating , according to the New York Times .
Oceanographers are accusing the government of failing to conduct an adequate scientific analysis of the damage and of allowing BP to obscure the true scope of the spill , as IntelDaily reports .
It 's not the first time the government has protected BP and its executives .
According to a report by Jason Leopold for TruthOut , Scott West was the special agent - in - charge at the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) Criminal Investigation Division who was probing alleged crimes committed by British Petroleum ( BP ) and the company 's senior officials in connection with a March 2006 pipeline rupture at the company 's Prudhoe Bay Operations in Alaska that spilled more than a quarter million gallons of crude -- the second largest spill in Alaska 's history that went undetected for nearly a week .

West transferred from San Francisco to Seattle in the summer of 2005 .
In Seattle , West met Chuck Hamel , an oil industry watchdog known to uncover sub- standard pollution laws at the Valdez tanker port in the 1980s prior to the Exxon Valdez spill .

In October 2007 , in what West calls a " package deal , " BP settled all of its major criminal cases .

The social and economic impact of the Gulf oil spill
By Kristina Betinis
24 May 2010
As the thick crude gushing from the broken well in the Gulf of Mexico coats wetlands along the Louisiana coast , reliable figures on the extent of the spill are precious and few .
BP has withheld crucial information , while the Obama administration is following BP ’s lead in insisting that clean - up efforts are not dependent on knowing how much oil is entering the Gulf .
These efforts are further hindered by the lack of current data about coastal areas produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
The protracted underfunding of federal agencies — in addition to their subservience to corporate interests — is contributing to the criminal lack of oversight involved in this catastrophe .
CNN reported that NOAA ’s administrator , Dr. Jane Lubchenco , told the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation on May 18 that half of the environmental sensitivity index atlases identifying coastal areas at great risk are over 10 years old : “ Many of them do not reflect current information . ”
Two things that are becoming clearer are the extent to which coastal industries are threatened by the spill , and the grave health risks posed by widespread contamination .
Anxieties grow for fishing , tourism and hospitality industries
This is the peak of the spawning season for many species of Gulf fish , crabs and oysters , and the effects of the spill are expected to greatly reduce the quantity of marine life for several generations .
Even as US commercial seafood harvests have dropped slightly over the last decade , the Gulf Coast is responsible for about half of the total US harvest in its high season .
Fishing in the Gulf of Mexico is an estimated $ 2.4 billion industry .
Nineteen percent of the Gulf Coast , or 46,000 square miles , is currently closed to fishing , between the Mississippi River and the Pensacola Bay .
Currently , migratory species of fish are assumed to be most affected .
Richard Shelby , a Republican Senator from Alabama , wrote in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke on May 18 : “ It is indisputable that the crisis we now face is man-made .
If the oil continues to spill in the Gulf unabated , it will not only destroy the fisheries this year , but will adversely impact the Gulf ’s ecosystem for decades .
Alabama ’s fishing industry represents one of the largest economic engines in the state — accounting for more than $ 800 million in sales and nearly 18,000 jobs .
We must proactively work to adequately deal with this situation . ”
Alabama expects oil to hit its shores on or near May 24 .
Fumes from burning oil on the surface of the Gulf were reported on beaches .
This week , Rear Adm .
Mary Landry , commander of the Eighth Coast Guard District , criticized BP for having “ hesitated ” in placing booms that were supposed to prevent much of the oil now blanketing the wetlands of Terrebonne Parish , Louisiana from reaching the area , where fishing , hunting and trapping still represent a significant sector of the economy .
Commercial fish stocks live some or all of their lives in the wetlands .
The region ’s tourism industry also faces devastation , which would further diminish jobs and state revenues , with the impact already being felt in states where oil has yet to come ashore .
Linda Hornsby , director of the Mississippi Hotel and Lodging Association , told the McClatchy news agency that occupancy at beachfront hotels was down 50 percent .
CBS
News reported that occupancy rates in the Florida panhandle are also off 50 percent for Memorial Weekend , and that some hotels are reporting occupancy as low as 15 percent .
Island House Hotel on the Alabama Gulf Coast told CBS that its losses had already run up to $ 100,000 - 200,000 by the second week in May , not counting convention business .
A survey of Gulf Coast hotels conducted by the Knowland Group revealed that 42 percent of respondents had group cancellations , a 7 point increase .
At the same time , some hotels in Louisiana have seen a marked increase in business owing to the nearly 25,000 scientists , reporters , photographers , cleanup workers , volunteers , environmentalists and others who are staying in the area .
This threatened bust for the key tourism sector comes in the midst of a deep and prolonged recession fueled by a mortgage crisis that caused enormous losses in property values — and thus tax revenues — in many of the affected areas .
Louisiana ’s industries , in many respects still recovering from the Hurricane Katrina disaster , are particularly hard hit .
Tourism in Louisiana is centered in part on game - fishing charters in the wetlands .
Growing concern has been expressed by the Department of the Interior that the part of the Gulf Stream called the loop current will carry oil into the region of the Florida Keys — home to a coral reef that is by all accounts particularly sensitive — up the east coast of Florida as far north as Cape Canaveral , and out into the Atlantic Ocean .
This would seriously hurt the state ’s revenue from tourism , which has dropped off in recent years due to the deep recession .
According to the Florida tourism board , the state ’s tourism industry is estimated at $ 65 billion , employs over one million workers , and accounts for 21 percent of the state ’s sales tax revenue .
In a report released by the Bonefish and Tarpon Trust , industry analysts have stated that if oil enters Florida ’s Everglades region it would mean disaster for its $ 1.2 billion sport fishing industry .
The report states that sport fishing in the Everglades “ produces more than $ 378 million in wages that support 12,391 full - time equivalent jobs and brings in tax revenues exceeding $ 90 million ( federal ) and $ 72 million ( state and local ) from Florida ’s 13 southernmost counties .
More than 8,000 jobs linked to saltwater sport fishing could be jeopardized if oil reaches the Everglades region . ”
About 7 million people rely on the aquifers of the Everglades for drinking water .
While BP has promised millions to the states of Alabama , Florida , Louisiana and Mississippi for clean - up and for an advertising campaign to counter the fall in tourism , the sums are insufficient to losses that have already been suffered on the Louisiana coast , not to mention those states where oil has not yet hit land .
On May 22 , Florida Governor Charlie Crist wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , noting that the company ’s efforts were plodding and that fishing charters have already begun to drop off all over the state .
He asked that Florida be immediately equipped with sufficient boom to protect the coasts that attract tourism .
Instances of canceled recreational fishing trips are being reported from Houma to Miami .
The effect of these losses on related industries is another worry , including recreational boat manufacturers , and fishing equipment and apparel producers .
Serious health concerns loom over clean - up efforts
Though clean - up efforts have been under way for weeks , BP remains silent about the serious health effects upon workers and volunteers of the chemicals and procedures being employed .
Concerns are mounting over the health effects of “ flaring ” on spill workers , the process of burning the gas after it has been piped to the surface of the water , exposure to chemical dispersants used to break up the oil in the water , and exposure to burning crude oil as it rests on the water ’s surface .
No public entity is currently monitoring the health effects of the spill , only scientists contracted to BP .
McClatchy reported that BP , with the full complicity of the Obama administration , continues to conceal safety data as proprietary information .
The company has not released results from air sampling tests to the public .
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) has access to the data , and has “ urged [ BP ] to do so . ”
Since the data was collected by BP contractors , an OSHA regional administrator said , “ It is n’t ours to publish . ” A BP spokesperson stated that the safety information has been shared with the “ legitimate interested parties . ”
Director of the worker training program at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , Joseph Hughes , told McClatchy he did n’t think “ anyone has seen much of that data at all . ”
The chemical dispersant used by BP in the Gulf of Mexico , Corexit 9500 , known to be more toxic and less effective than other approved mixtures , has been deployed in large amounts and at great depths in an attempt to break up the oil billowing out of the well head , and on the surface of the Gulf .
The environmental effects of its unprecedented use at great depths are not known .
Additionally , the contents of dispersants are treated as trade secrets , and so it is currently unknown what exactly is being pumped into the Gulf in great quantities , much less its long - term impact .
Corexit 9500 was reportedly banned in Britain for use in oil spills over a decade ago because of concerns over its environmental impact .
There are also reports that health problems among workers involved in the cleanup following the 1989 Exxon - Valdez spill in Alaska , including respiratory , nervous system , liver , kidney and blood disorders , were linked to an earlier version of the Corexit dispersant .
On May 19 , the chairman and president of BP American , Lamar McKay , was asked by a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee why the company had decided to use such a toxic dispersant .
The next day , the Environmental Protection Agency ordered BP to use a chemical dispersant less toxic than the Corexit 9500 currently being used to disperse the crude .
The company issued a statement over the weekend flatly rejecting the EPA ’s demand : “ Based on the information that is available today , BP continues to believe that Corexit was the best and most appropriate choice at the time when the incident occurred , and that Corexit remains the best option for subsea application . ”
Recent reports indicate that over 600,000 gallons of Corexit 9500 have been poured onto the surface of the Gulf , and 55,000 in deep water .
In the course of questioning McKay , major health issues came to light .
New York Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler stated , “ Corexit is 2.61 in toxicity , which means it ’s highly toxic .
It has an effectiveness of 54.7 in the south Louisiana crude - oil spill .
[ Dispersit―another agent ] is 7.9 toxicity , which means it ’s a lot less toxic , but it has an effectiveness rate of 100 % .
Mare Clean 200 , its toxicity rate is 42 , which is much , much better .
Its effectiveness rate is 84 , compared to Corexit at 54 . ”
Another representative voiced concerns about the effects on humans of eating fish contaminated with toxic dispersant .
No systematic attention has been given to safety — either in the operation of the well before the explosion , or in regard to environmental questions afterwards , as BP continues to withhold key information .
The ill effects of the clean - up efforts organized by BP may last long after those of the oil itself .
On May 11 , John T. Everett , formerly a climate change expert with NOAA who now operates a consulting firm to fisheries and ocean - related businesses , addressed a Senate subcommittee on Environment and Public Works .
While he acknowledged “ the importance of dealing with here and now threats to our sea-life and to ourselves , ” Everett warned that “ even the oil damage will eventually heal ...
The flow of chemical materials into our waters is another matter .
There are too many insidious contaminants entering our estuaries , causing genetic harm and poisoning our birds , turtles , and seafood . ”
Pngnq is a tool for quantizing PNG images in RGBA format .
Pngnq is an adaptation by Stuart Coyle of Greg Roelf 's pnqquant using Anthony Dekker 's neuquant algorithm .
Version 1.0 includes improvements made by porneL : http://pornel.net/pngnq
The neuquant algorithm uses a neural network to optimise the color map selection .
This is fast and quite accurate , giving good results on many types of images .
Why another quantizer ?
Pngnq exists because I needed a lot ( several thousand ) of png images in RGBA format to be quantized .
After some searching , the only tool I could find that worked for RGBA was pngquant .
I tried pngquant but found that the median cut algorithm that it uses , with or without dithering , gave inferior looking results to the neuquant algorithm .
You can see the difference demonstrated on the neuquant page .
Pngnq was written to fulfill the specific needs of the small project I was working on , and as such does not have all the functionality one could want .
It is developing though , I have recently ( June 2006 ) come back to it to add functionality and make it more useful in various situations .
It will stay as a command line quantization tool rather than evolve into a full compression process as I 'd rather keep the program as performing one specific function .
If optimal compression is needed one can use something like pngcrush after quantization .
I use Greg Roelf 's png reading and writing code unchanged for the most part .
The pngnq source code includes neuquant32 , which is an extension of Anthony Dekker 's neuquant .
This has been modified to allow it to handle 4 channels of pixel data and to vary the number of colors quantized to .
Thanks go to these people for developing such useful code and making it open source .
Comparisons with other quantizers .
Speed
The quantizer is fairly slow compared to median cut or octree methods .
It is most certainly faster than Spatial Quantization techniques .
It is limited mostly to off - line uses rather than real time image delivery .
Even so , I am sure Moore 's Law will make that statement false at some short time in the future .
I 've not run any comprehensive speed comparisons with other algorithms .
The speed of the algorithm can be increased by increasing the sample factor ( -s option ) .
The sample factor determines what fraction of pixels are examined by the algorithm .
Compression
Pngnq seems to work best when quantizing to a fairly large number of colors ( > =64 ) .
This mainly a result of the visible edges due to the lack of dithering .
The amount of compression of images gained is determined largely by the level of quantization .
Using a tool like pngcrush to further process these images results in slightly smaller images than with methods that dither the image .
This is probably due to the lack of high frequency data in the non-dithered images .
To quantize and compress an image , for example image.png , with the compressed output as smallimage.png , I do this :
pngnq -n 256 image.png && pngcrush image - nq8.png smallimage.png
This usually results in a greater than 50 % compression with a small loss of detail .
Quality
I have run tests on the measured difference between quantized and unquantized images using pngnq , pngquant and scolorq .
The error measure used is the Euclidian distance in RGBA space between pixels in the quantized and unquantized images .
These have shown that the neuquant algorithm performs better than the median cut for most images , I suspect though that each reach close to the .
Since reading Puzicha et. al. and running some tests , I have decided that this may not be the best measure of percieved difference in images .
A better test of “ percieved ” image distance is in development .
I 've run some comparisons here : Sample quantized images .
I have tested pngnq with these test images .
No errors occur except in the deliberately corrupt test images , in which case the image loading correctly reports the corrupt image and the quantizer carries on as normal .
Things that pngnq needs work on :
I want to change the error measure to use CIE u'v ' color space and see if results are visually better .
Or perhaps add a perception filter model .
Limited image input formats .
I am not doing much checking on the image pixel depth etc .
Advantages
There seem to be few image editing programs that correctly deal with paletted RGBA png images .
This is a pity since the alpha channel is so useful on the web , when browsers support it correctly .
The only other quantization program I have found that does this is pngquant .
Future projects :
A plug in for GIMP ( Problematic since GIMP does not display RGBA paletted mode although it loads and saves them alright . )
An ImageMagick library extension to do RGBA quantization .
Photoshop integration .
Updates :
May 2009 : Merged ' improved pngnq ' and added configure script .
Changes include gamma setting , better assignment of transparent colors so they do n't take up too much of the palette space , Floyd Steinberg dithering .
Many thanks to Kornel Lesinski for his great improvements .
Im calling this version 1.0 , for what it 's worth .
It 's in svn , and Linux and Mac binaries have been built .
The other binaries will be forthcoming .
I 'll also be adding example images using the new version soon so you can see what it does .
December 2007 : moved pngnq to Sourceforge .
October - December 2007 .
Windows binary and Mac universal binary made available .
A Gentoo ebuild for 0.5 is also available .
Version 0.6 has been started .
17th June 2006 .
Sample Factor Bug .
I have found a bug which I inadvertently introduced into the Neuquant code which causes the neuquant algorithm to scan only 3/4 of the pixels .
The bug effectively causes the sample factor to be 25 % too large .
Whilst this gives acceptable results the image quality is improved when all pixels are scanned .
The patch for this bug is available for version 0.3 and version 0.4.0 .
Version 0.4.1 and 0.3.1 have been patched .
0.5 Update and bugfix .
Fixed a bug that caused images to turn green .

Isesaki authorities order staff to shave off beards and moustaches after complaints from public
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
In feudal Japan , a beard was considered a symbol of power or a declaration of belligerent intent but bureaucrats in one town could find themselves sent to the bathroom , razor in hand , for sporting even the suggestion of a five o'clock shadow .
Authorities in Isesaki , Gunma prefecture , have ordered all male employees to shave off their facial hair , and banish all thoughts of growing any , following complaints from members of the public who said they found dealing with bearded bureaucrats " unpleasant " .
The ban , the first of its kind among Japanese public officials , applies to any manifestation of facial hair , from lovingly cultivated full beards to trendy goatees and designer stubble .
The only acceptable public face of Isesaki , the local government said , is a clean - shaven one .
" Some citizens find bearded men unpleasant , so beards are banned , " an in - house notice warned this week .
The notice acknowledges the growing popularity of facial hair among Japanese men , encouraged by sportsmen and celebrities , but insists that " public servants should look like public servants " .
The ban was introduced this week to coincide with the start of Cool Biz , a summer campaign now in its sixth year that allows male staff to work without jackets and ties to cut down on air - conditioning and help tackle climate change .
The Isesaki ban is reminiscent of the strict rules on physical appearance enforced by conservative companies in the postwar period in the belief that Japan 's rise to economic superpower required absolute conformity .
But this was the first time that an absence of whiskers had been enforced among civil servants , the internal affairs and communications ministry said .
Bearded Japanese men sniffed at the town government 's belief that a workforce of smooth - chinned bureaucrats would " improve decorum " .
" I am designing beards for my customers that are considered acceptable in the company workplace , " Minoru Fujii , a member of Hige [ beard ]
Club , a Tokyo beard advocacy group comprising mainly barbers , told Kyodo News .
He added that there was little he could do to help the put -upon penpushers of Isesaki .

WINNIPEG - Hockey commentator Don Cherry is so bullish on the idea of getting NHL hockey back in Winnipeg , he 's prepared to put his money where his famous mouth is .
Cherry told two at least radio interviewers today that , given the opportunity , he would most definitely invest his own money in a new NHL franchise for Winnipeg .
DARREN CALABRESE / THE CANADIAN PRESS CBC Hockey Night in Canada 's Don Cherry
" Yes , it 's a winner , " Cherry told host Mike Hogan on The Fan 590 sports radio station in Toronto .
" I 'd be happy to invest . "
Cherry said there is no future for NHL hockey in Phoenix and does not understand why the NHL wants to keep a team in the desert at whatever cost .
" It 's an endless pit out there , " Cherry said .
[ Hear the full interview on the Fan 590 website . ]
Cherry later repeated his offer on Winnipeg 's 92 CITI FM .

As she made her rounds at an upscale Calabasas retirement home one morning , Adelina Campos said she walked into a room and caught a fellow caregiver in the act of abusing an elderly man suffering from dementia .
The worker was in midair , hurtling from atop a dresser toward the bed , landing both knees onto the man ’s belly .
“ I was just in shock , ” Campos said .
The horrible tale and other accounts of abuse are unfolding this week in the trial of Cesar Ulloa , a low - level employee accused of severely mistreating residents , some of whom would have been too dementia - ridden to alert anyone to the alleged abuse .
Ulloa , 21 , is charged with seven counts of elder abuse and one count of torture .
If convicted , he faces a possible life sentence .
In addition to abusing the elderly man , prosecutors say , Ulloa jumped on a woman ’s chest and body - slammed her into a bed when she struggled .
The 78 - year - old woman was mute because of a brain condition .
He also allegedly took the arm of one wheelchair - bound resident and used it to hit another resident who had dementia , encouraging them to fight .
“ He attacked the most vulnerable people you can possibly find , ” Deputy Dist .
Atty .
Robin Allen told a Van Nuys jury .
“ He hit them and he laughed .
This was sport . ”
For adults considering assisted care homes for their parents , the alleged abuses are particularly distressing because of where they ’re said to have occurred : Silverado Senior Living .
The Calabasas facilities are about as close to a four - star hotel as retirement homes get , with relatives shelling out upward of $ 70,000 a year to house their loved ones .
The state attorney general ’s office has called elder abuse in nursing homes a serious problem .
In a 12 - month period between 2007 and 2008 , there were 85 elder abuse convictions in California , according to the state Department of Justice .
Many cases go undetected or unreported , authorities said .
The prosecutor in Ulloa ’s trial painted Silverado as a retirement home ripe for undetected abuse .
Low - level caregivers , few of whom had more than a high school education , she said , received just days of training before taking the floor .
Cameras that could have deterred brutality were installed in the halls but not in residents ’ rooms , where caregivers bathed and changed residents .
The caregivers , who make about $ 10 an hour , are also responsible for escorting residents throughout the facility .
Ulloa ’s attorney , Daniel Teola , denied that his client ever abused residents , attributing the allegations to false rumors circulated by veteran staffers envious of Ulloa ’s rapid success .
Just three months after being hired , Ulloa was named employee of the month .
Any injuries , Teola said , would have been incidental .
Because the retirement home pledges not to restrain or sedate residents -- a necessary reality at other facilities -- patients who become combative , he said , are more prone to injury .
The attorney compared the set - up to a free - range chicken farm .
“ You ’re going to have bruises , ” he said .
“ You ’re going to have fractures . ”
Ulloa , short and boyish , watched the proceedings calmly , breaking his stare only to scrawl notes to his attorney with a miniature pencil .
His thin frame hardly filled his gray dress shirt .
The Reseda resident was fired before charges were brought against him , for reasons officials at Silverado said were unrelated to the allegations of abuse .
The retirement home has denied any wrongdoing .
“ At Silverado we always have the greatest concern for the safety of our residents and strive in every respect to provide a safe environment at our community .
Our staff are dedicated to serving our residents in a way that respects and honors them , ” said Loren Shook , president and chief executive of Silverado .
Ulloa , just 19 at the time of the alleged abuse , came under suspicion after a resident at the home , Elmore Kittower , died in 2007 , presumably of natural causes .
The day after saying goodbye to her husband of almost 50 years at his funeral , Kittower ’s widow got a call from a stranger .
The voice on the other end was that of Campos ’ mother , and she told the grieving woman that her husband had been beaten to death .
“ I ca n’t talk anymore .
I ’m nauseated , ” Rita Kittower recalled saying , during testimony Monday , blinking furiously and sobbing in spurts .
Days later , with her permission , Los Angeles County sheriff ’s deputies exhumed the former engineer ’s body .
Trauma was found , with signs of multiple broken bones at various stages of healing .
An autopsy showed blunt force trauma as a contributing factor in his death .
Detectives launched a yearlong investigation into Ulloa and discovered other alleged victims .
He was arrested Oct. 2 , 2008 , and has remained in custody .
At trial this week , prosecution witnesses have detailed some of the suspected abuse .
Luz Alvarez , one former caregiver , testified that she saw Ulloa taunting residents , telling a male patient he “ was sexing his daughter . ”
Another time , as she dressed one resident for breakfast , she said she witnessed Ulloa in a struggle with a combative resident .
Ulloa , she said , clenched his right fist and punched the wheelchair - bound man in the stomach .
“ Have n’t you had enough ? ” Alvarez recalled Ulloa saying as he laughed at the gasping man .
When she returned to the room after dropping off her patient at breakfast , she found the punched man hunched over , his head cocked to one side , with white foamy saliva bubbling out of his mouth .
Initially , she said , she remained silent about the incident out of loyalty to her co-worker and fear of compromising her job security , but she said the image of the man foaming at the mouth haunted her .
Eventually she talked to authorities .
At least one juror was moved to tears after hearing Rita Kittower testify about the death of her husband .
When asked if she was married to Elmore Kittower , the tiny 86 - year - old , still wearing her wedding ring , responded in the present tense , “ I am , ” before reminding the jury that Tuesday would have been their anniversary .
She recounted the decision to move her husband , who had suffered a debilitating stroke , to Silverado despite the home ’s hefty price tag .
“ I think we need to do this for Dad , ” she recalled telling her daughter .
“ He ’s been so good to us ; we need to be good to him . ”
The two had met in 1957 , as she washed her red Ford convertible outside her West Hollywood apartment .
She hosed the stranger by mistake , and the two got to talking .
Toward the end of his life , she said he could hardly speak , transformed from a kind , thoughtful man who volunteered at the local high school to a bitter and combative one .
He would often spit out his meds , barking , “ Chemicals . ”
But during some visits , his old self would resurface .
He would take her hand into his , lift it to his lips and kiss it .

Several months ago , I blogged about a new theory on why men love breasts .
New theories pop up all the time , so it ’s no surprise that there are new theories on male body parts , too .
A recent issue of Archives of Sexual Behavior features an alternative explanation for the shape of the human penis .
As described in BLONDES , the prevailing theory on why the human penis has a distinctive head and corona ( rounded projecting border ) is that it can scoop out semen deposited in the vagina by a woman ’s previous lovers , thus averting a pregnancy .
This means the last lover , not the first , gets the head - start .
Not likely , says Dr. Edwin Bowman , in his letter to the editor .
Instead of scooping out other men ’s semen , writes Bowman , the penile head and corona scoop out vaginal secretions .
After collected , these fluids are then absorbed by the foreskin .
The mucous membrane of the foreskin , it turns out , is like a sponge for the stuff .
Why would evolution select for men to absorb vaginal secretions ?
Just as semen has “ mind control properties , ” so do vaginal fluids .
When ovulating and most likely to conceive , these secretions contain neurohormones such as pitocin and vasopressin .
The latter in particular has been associated with bonding and is thought to trigger protective behavior among males for their partners .
Vasopressin , after all , is thought of as a male “ love drug . ”
Flooded with bonding hormones , a guy may be more likely to stick around if he impregnates his partner .
Knowing this , will more men use condoms ?
As stunning as it may seem , people who are presented with photographs of candidates for political office can predict the winner at levels far above chance .
In a series of studies , participants were presented with photos of two candidates for elected offices throughout the United States .
The participants were from different regions of the country , so they did not recognize any of the candidates .
Asked to predict the winner of the election , the participants were able to pick not only the winner of the election , but the margin of victory , both at levels significantly above chance .
In a stunning replication of these studies published in the journal Science , John Antonakis and Olaf Dalgas asked Swiss children aged 5 to 13 to look at two pictures of candidates for elections in France and asked school children who would they choose to be captain of their boat ( the children were playing a computer game that simulated a sea voyage ) .
The students more often picked the winning candidate to be captain .
What does this say about the psychology of elections and our election process in general ?
First , we make snap judgments based on very limited pieces of information - what social psychologists call " thin slices " - a brief interaction or a photograph .
Second , there are cues available in faces that seem to convey the appearance of competence and / or dominance , that we assume suggests potential .
Some of this research is reviewed in Malcom Gladwell 's book , Blink .
The results of these studies do not bode well for the quality of our electoral process .
Given that the majority of the U.S. voting population cast their votes along strict party lines , elections are decided by the minority of " swing voters , " and included in those swing voters are many who base their decisions , like the children and research participants in these studies , on very surface characteristics and quick decisions about how competent the person is from very thin slices of behavior .
If you want to read more about this research , there is a special edition in the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior devoted to this line of research .

RABAT ( Reuters ) - Elton John will headline Morocco ’s biggest music festival this week despite calls by religious conservatives for the gay singer to be turned away , the event ’s organizer said .

Allowing the British singer and songwriter to perform at the Mawazine World Rhythms festival in the capital Rabat would tarnish the image of the north African kingdom , say powerful opposition Islamists .
The writer of “ Candle in the Wind ‘ 97 ” ’ , the best - selling single of all time , according to the Guinness Book of Records , has championed sexual freedom and campaigned against the spread of AIDS during a four - decade musical career .
“ Elton John is one of the best artists in the world .
He is great and extraordinary when he appears on stage .
That ’s why we invite him and welcome him to the Mawazine festival , ” festival director Aziz Daki told Reuters .
“ The private life of a singer is not our business .
We do not invite singers and artists after assessing their private lives . ”
The festival , backed by Morocco ’s King Mohammed , brings together musicians from 50 countries and has drawn criticism from Islamists who say such events encourage promiscuity and alcohol consumption , corrupting Islamic values .
“ We asked the government to exclude this person from the list of artists invited to this festival .
This man -- sorry , I should say this person , not this man -- is known for bragging about his homosexuality , ” said Mustapha Ramid , a leading parliamentarian from the opposition Islamist PJD party .
“ Morocco is an Islamic state where stages should not used to allow a person with such a degree of debauchery to perform because we have to shield the young from such influences , ” said Ramid .
Khalil Hachemi Idrissi , editor of the French - language daily Aujourd ’hui Le Maroc , said : “ Such a point of view , if we do not pay enough attention , will quickly turn Morocco into an ostracised country among civilized nations . ”
Liberal intellectuals see the calls to scrap Elton John from the festival line - up as part of an attempt by religious conservatives to reverse the modernization of Morocco .
Daki said attendance at the festival would be the “ ultimate answer ” to critics .
Mawazine runs from May 21 to 29 and is due to feature over 100 musicians including Britain ’s Mika , Spanish crooner Julio Iglesias and Lebanese star Elissa .

I just published a new book with a mildly obscene title : The No Asshole Rule : Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That Is n’t .
The first question that EVERYONE seems to ask me is why – given I am an apparently a respectable tenured professor – I use such a bold ( and to some , offensive ) title .
Here are my top seven reasons :
1 . My father always told me to avoid assholes at all costs , no matter how rich or powerful they might be , because I would catch their nastiness and impose it on others .
I learned , as an organizational psychologist , that his advice is supported by research on “ emotional contagion : ” if you work for a jerk , odds are you will become one .
2 . I worked in an academic department at Stanford where we openly talked about the no asshole rule and used it in hiring decisions .
It made the old Department of Industrial Engineering & Engineering Management a better place to work .
3 . In 2004 , I wrote an essay for the Harvard Business Review called “ More Trouble Than They ’re Worth , ” which talked about the no asshole rule .
I had published other articles in HBR , longer and more well - researched ones , but nothing had provoked such a strong response .
I ’ve since received more than 1,000 emails on assholes ( I just counted 77 new emails from strangers in just the past week . ) and have been told hundreds and hundreds of stories .
Some are troubling , like the fellow going through chemotherapy whose boss “ told me I was ‘ a wimp and a pussy . ' ”
Other stories are funny ( like the woman whose boss kept stealing food from her desk , so she made candies out of Ex - Lax , which he promptly stole and ate ) and still others are encouraging ( including notes from CEOs who actively screen out and fire demeaning people ) .
The first example was the most common , and it reflected the pain that people feel when they are treated terribly , whether they are models , engineers , or CEOs who feel abused by their boards .
4 . I was determined to use the word asshole in the title because , to me , other words like “ jerk , ” “ bully , ” “ tyrant , ” “ despot , ” and so on are just euphemisms for what people really call those creeps .
And when I have done such damage to people ( indeed , all of us are capable of being assholes some of the time ) , that is what I call myself .
I know the term offends some people , but nothing else captures the emotional wallop .
Not everyone agrees with me ; check out this fantastic letter that a reader wrote to the San Francisco Chronicle after a story about my book appeared .
5 . I have uncovered quite a few companies that screen out and do n’t tolerate “ workplace jerks . ”
Many of these places – law firm Perkins Coie , the research department at Lehman Brothers under Jack Rivkin , and software firm Success Factors – that have ( or had ) such rules may call them “ no jerk rules ” for public consumption .
But when you talk to them , they talk about screening out assholes , not jerks .
For example , Harvard Business School Assistant Professor Boris Groysberg wrote me that they called it the no asshole rule at Lehman , but he had to write it as the no jerk rule in his teaching cases .
My favorite company these days is Success Factors , which has all new employees sign 14 rules of engagement .
The last is agreeing not to be an asshole !
Success Factors is pretty successful :
It has grown from 100 to 400 employees over the past year .
6 . There are things that people out there who are victims of bullies can do to fight back and the word needs to get out .
Consider this ( edited ) email that a government worker sent me about how she and her co-workers convinced management to deal with a nasty and demeaning co-worker :
“ I have worked [ at a government agency ] for four years and encountered the asshole of all assholes very early on .
After months of being tormented by her and comforting other tearful victims , I decided to document her behavior .
I kept a little notebook in my pocket and wrote down her behaviors that were racist , slanderous , threatening , etc .
I documented the many harmful things she did with dates and times .
I encouraged her other victims to do so too and these written and signed statements were presented to our supervisor .
Our supervisors knew this worker was an asshole but did n’t do anything to stop her harmful behaviors until they received these statements .
The asshole went on a mysterious leave that no supervisor was permitted to discuss and she never returned . ”
7 . The most important reason that I wrote this book is that demeaning people do terrible damage to others and to their companies .
And even though there are occasions when being an asshole helps people and companies “ win , ” my view is that if you are a winner and an asshole , you are still an asshole and I do n’t want to be around you !
You ’re out there in the trenches .
I bet some of these bosses seem familiar .
Some of us may see a bit of ourselves in there , too .
Do you believe that putting down others is sometimes necessary to get ahead ?

Via Hemant Mehta comes this story that could not have happened at a more appropriate time .
One of the most basic principles of the United States , written out in the very first Amendment of the Bill of Rights , is that the government will neither endorse nor deny any specific religion , or interfere with anyone 's ability to worship or not .
This is pretty straightforward .
You have the right to your religion , and I have the right to mine .
You even have the right to not have a religion .
But no matter what , you have the right to not have your religion interfered with .
Eric Workman , a ( now - graduated ) high school student in Greenwood , Indiana , understood this .
That 's why , when his school administration decided to let the seniors vote on whether they wanted to have an official school - sanctioned prayer at graduation , he tried to get it stopped .
He wound up having to take the case to the ACLU , and a judge ordered that no school - sanctioned prayer could be held at the ceremony .
There 's a lot to discuss here , but the most important things to remember during any of it are these :
1 ) Eric is correct , and 2 ) Eric is Christian .
That 's right , he 's not some baby - eating atheist waiting to escort the souls of the graduating class to Satan 's doorstep .
He 's a Christian , but even in that extremely conservative area he understands that the Constitution , and our Founding Fathers , got it right .
Another extremely important thing to remember is that no one was keeping these students from praying .
They had the right to pray as much as they wanted to before , during , and after the ceremony .
The class president stood up and thanked God in her speech , and she had every right to do so , just as Eric had the right to talk about how important secularism is in school ( the complete text of his speech is on reddit ) .
The only thing being prevented here was state - sponsored support of religion .
That 's it .
With all this in mind , watch the coverage this got on the local news .
Today is Memorial Day in the United States , where we take time to remember those who have died , and specifically those who have fought and died for the country .
In my opinion , they did n't fight to protect our country , they fought to protect the idea of our country .
The principles for which it stands , the ideas and ideals that give people the chance to reach their full potential .
That 's what America is supposed to be about , and the framework that provides that chance is the Constitution .
It does not limit what the people can do * , it limits how the government can in turn limit them .
You are allowed to speak freely .
You are allowed to vote .
And you are allowed your religion , or lack thereof .
The government cannot stop that , but neither can it actively support it .
That way , everyone has the same rights , and it keeps the government from turning into a theocracy .
This should be something advocated by not just the non-religious , and , in fact , should be most loudly supported by the most religious .
It 's their rights being protected too .
The administration of Greenwood High School lost track of that simple fact , but ironically , their own education system worked .
One student did learn it , and schooled the administration .
So it makes me happy -- and proud , as an American -- to say :

But the hacking kit works only with Canon cameras , one of the most popular brands .
Apparently , no such extensive project exists for hacking the software that runs Nikon , Sony , Panasonic or other popular cameras .
The Canon hack kit is good at setting up a camera to perform simple , repetitive tasks .
Julien Quénard , an amateur photographer and bird watcher in Arrest , France , programmed his Canon PowerShot A540 to constantly watch for birds , modifying a motion - detection script originally written by a developer who referred to himself among fellow camera hackers only as Fudgey .
When the birds move into the frame , the camera quickly focuses and then takes a sequence of four pictures .
He keeps the camera pointed at the bird feeder , but he has also found that the redstarts and flycatchers like one particular section of his garden .
Mr. Quénard ’s version uses the fastest shutter speed possible because the birds move quickly , and uses macro mode for close focus .
The camera ’s new software leaves some tasks for him , however .
“ Each time , there are a few good pictures and hundreds for the trash , ” he said .
“ I also need to crop most pictures for better framing . ”
The C.H.D.K. developers pool their resources at chdk.wikia.com , a Web site that collects software contributions and shares the packages with other users .
Any photographer can download software files free under an open - source license and copy it onto a flash memory card that normally holds photographs .
The site offers a “ C.H.D.K. for Dummies ” page with step - by - step instructions for loading the software into the camera .
The C.H.D.K. software loads itself into the camera by taking advantage of the updating mechanism normally used by the manufacturer to install new software with bug fixes or new features .
When a Canon camera is first turned on , the camera scans the flash memory card for updates to the camera ’s software , often called firmware .
The C.H.D.K. software is made to be temporary , though , and it can be removed by turning off the camera and deleting these files from the flash card .
The C.H.D.K .
Web site warns that something may go wrong in the process , potentially voiding the warranty , but several developers say there are no documented cases that it has ever happened .

I hit my first real roadbump with jQuery yesterday , a missing feature that really made me stop and stare in puzzlement : j Query does n't support xml - namespace selectors .
Since I 'm trying to parse WebDAV response bodies , and such documents make extensive use of namespaces , it 's quite the issue for me .
Or rather , it was quite the issue – read on if you 're interested in the details , or just download my solution if you 're impatient .
Oh sure , jQuery supports prefix selectors just fine .
If your document contains an element < D:response > , you can quite safely query for that element by name as long as you remember to backslash - escape the colon :
$ ( doc ) . find ( " D\\:response " )
This works as long as you can guarantee that a single prefix is used for the target namespace , and that it 's used uniformly throughout the document .
But the XML Namespaces standard , as well as the WebDAV standard , make it very clear that you can't rely on this in general .
The node name prefix is a purely syntactic construct , while its actual namespace is a semantic property that can be specified in several different ways .
Fortunately , the CSS Level 3 standard provides a very clear syntax and semantics for namespace - aware queries .
After declaring ' D ' to be the proper WebDAV namespace URI , the CSS - 3 equivalent to the above prefix query would be :
$ ( doc ) . find ( " D|response " )
Unfortunately , this syntax is largely still a pipe - dream .
Not only is it missing from jQuery , but I could n't find another implementation to help get me off the ground .
The only thing for it was to implement it myself – so about six hours later , after studying the internals of the Sizzle selector engine and adventuring from getElementsByTagNameNS through to XPath 's namespace - uri ( ) and local - name ( ) functions , I have a solution that I 'm happy to show to the world : jquery.xmlns.js .
This plugin extends the jQuery tag and attribute query functions to allow an optional namespace selector .
In the simplest case you declare a namespace prefix in the $ .xmlns object , then just query for it as normal :
$ . xmlns [ " D " ] = " DAV : " ;
$ ( doc ) . find ( " D|response " ) . each (... ) ;
Sadly , the namespace declarations need to be global since the underlying jQuery / Sizzle selector machinery is stateless .
If you 're anything like me , such globals will offend your delicate programming sensibilities .
To perform a namespace - based query and automatically clean up when you 're done , you can use the xmlns query method as follows :
$ ( doc ) . xmlns ( { D : " DAV : " } , function ( ) {
//
The ' D ' namespace is declared within this function
return this .
find ( " D|response " ) . each (... ) ;
// and removed again when the function exits
} ) ;
It 's also possible to specify a default namespace , which will be used when no explicit selector is given .
Just pass a string rather than a mapping object , like so :
$ ( doc ) . xmlns ( " DAV : " , function ( ) {
//
This only searches within the ' DAV : ' namespace
return this .
find ( " response " ) . each (... ) ;
} ) ;
Namespaced attribute selectors are also supported , although there are some restrictions as spelled out here .
The following would search for elements with a ' href ' attribute in any namespace :
$ ( doc ) . find ( " [ * |href ] " ) ;
Of course , there are plenty of caveats here .
I 've tested this on Firefox and IE7 and it meets my expectations , but I have n't explored any of the bizarre corner cases that I 'm sure are lurking out there .
I also have n't done any performance testing , although I have tried hard not to slow down the common case where a namespace selector is not specified .
I 'm far from an expert here – any bug reports , success reports or general suggestions most welcome !
Now , to actually get on with the job I was supposed to be doing yesterday ...
Recently I started reading Esoterrorists and Trail of Cthulhu again , since I am planning to run a game using the GUMSHOE system .
While doing some research on the system , reading playtest reports and listening to actual play podcasts , some questions arose .
Although I was very intruiged by the GUMSHOE system , there are a few things that concerned me , so I thought the best cause of action would be to contact the creator of the system to ask him a few question .
And luckily enough , Robin D. Laws agreed to do an interview .
Please note :
The intervierw was done by email and I added the photos afterwards .
So the photos do n’t convey Robin ’s emotions while answering those questions .
It ’s just me fooling around with his profile pictures from his Lifejournal account .
The photos are used with his permission .
Sherlock Holmes might be doable as a crossover out of the gaming scene because of the large Holmesian collectors ’ market .
On those grounds , it may be that something like Gareth Hanrahan ’s Trail Of Cthulhu supplement , Arkham Detective Tales , is as close as we can come to a straight - up hardboiled game .
The question then becomes whether we could sell enough copies to justify doing any of these settings .
Traditionally gamers play historical RPGs only if you add a fantastical element to them , whether it ’s magic or SF gear or Cthulhoid horrors .
You see this logic at work in Mutant City Blues , which takes the modern police procedural and makes it interesting to our audience by grafting super - powers onto it .
The smaller base of players who want a straight police procedural can then take the book , ignore the super stuff , and they ’re set to go .
The hardboiled detective is one of many sub -genres of straight - up mystery that could easily be done with GUMSHOE .
A Sherlock Holmes game is another obvious choice .
Because they ’re medieval history buffs , lots of gamers enjoy Ellis Peters ’ Cadfael books , .
Thanks to Lindsey Davis , the Roman empire is also an appealing setting for mystery that in its own toga - clad way recalls the classic tropes of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett .
Robin :
We needed a snappy , one - word name that instantly conveys the core idea behind not just the first game , but the system , and GUMSHOE seemed instantly to be the right choice .
It was the first name I came up with and we never considered another one .
Stargazer :
At least for me the name GUMSHOE conjures up images of hardboiled ’ 40s detectives wearing trenchcoats and fedoras , but no game using this system is actually set into this genre .
Was this intentional or are you considering writing a game inspired by the “ hardboiled detective genre ” ?
The gamer soul is torn when a new game appears .
The uber - gamer wants to buy new games , yet does not want to buy new games .
Who wants to spend more money on more stuff ?
None of us , yet at the same time all of us .
This sales resistance is understandable , and fuels the online reception to new products as they appear .
You have to expect a certain segment of the audience to ask if your game really needs to exist .
RPGs are entertainment products ; none of them need to exist .
The ultimate proof in the pudding is not whether folks question a game ’s existence , but whether enough of them buy it , dig it , and keep playing it .
And fortunately we ’ve reached a point where GUMSHOE has acquired a self - sustaining base of players who see why the game warrants its independent existence and are happy to keep on playing it .
Similarly , it ’s a simple fact of RPG marketing that you can sell more copies of a product that appears as a core game than you can as a supplement or modification to something else .
So while on a design level , you could easily bolt on the basic concept of GUMSHOE to any existing traditional investigative game , the reception dynamics that determine which ideas get taken up and which ones vanish decreed that it should be presented as the core of its own specialized game system .
Once it ’s injected into the bloodstream of gaming in this way , your strand of conceptual DNA can then become a permanent part of various GMs ’ play styles , and travel from there into other games .
A previous example of the same phenomenon would be the way that Feng Shui encouraged players to describe elements of the physical environment and incorporate them into their fight descriptions .
In 2009 this sounds like an incredibly minor step toward the shared narrative control that now runs through so many indie designs .
At the time it came as an exciting revelation to many GMs , and changed the way they played their other games , too .
The basic idea behind the game could have been conveyed in a number of ways .
I could have written it as a magazine article , as a chunk of rules text for an existing rules set , or as a blog post .
All of these choices , however , would ignore the process through which ideas enter the collective gamer consciousness and become part of the established corpus of techniques .
To do that , you need a new rules set to garner sustained attention and spotlight your defining idea .
That gets hundreds and thousands of gamers to grapple with the concept you ’re working to convey , rather than the dozens or hundreds you ’d get otherwise .
Investigative roleplaying has always been one of the major structural forms of roleplaying , but is comparatively under - served compared to the action - adventure gaming that forms the basis of almost all other RPGs , no matter what their exterior genre trappings might be .
Inspectres did a great and innovative job in the cooperative storytelling arena , where the entire group collaborates to create the mystery as the game develops .
But it seemed like there was still creative room left to explore the more traditional mystery game , where the GM has a predetermined solution and the players piece together the clues to work toward it .
Robin : Simon Rogers of Pelgrane Press commissioned me to create a rules system that would rethink investigative roleplaying from the ground up .
He ’d been frustrated in the past by the dead ends that tend to crop up in investigative games and wanted a system that would remove these roadblocks .
I started by examining the problem of the failed information - gathering roll that stops the plot , but we wound up with a mechanism that changes much more than just that one classic dilemma .
From that simple change evolved a streamlined investigative engine allowing for a focus on clue interpretation over clue gathering .
The result are games that more closely emulate mystery stories , from Lovecraftian probings into truths best left unlearned , to TV police procedurals .
Stargazer :
Thanks again for answering a few questions for me and my readers .
Some time ago I stumbled upon the GUMSHOE system in general and Esoterrorists in particular .
The GUMSHOE system has been designed with investigative scenarios in mind .
When did you first have the idea to create a roleplaying game especially for that kind of play ?
Stargazer :
While reading reviews of Esoterrorists on the internet , I ’ve noticed that a lot of people are skeptical that the GUMSHOE system is needed , because a good GM can always avoid that the game stalls when the players miss important clues .
How would you counter these arguments ?
Robin : Even a GM has never run into the failed roll issue or does n’t see it as a problem will still find plenty to check out in GUMSHOE .
It changes the flow and structure of investigative play in a way that many groups will find fresh and exciting .
By giving the players lots of information , it speeds sessions and alters their focus .
Play revolves not around the question of whether you find information , but what you do with it .
This allows us to create more detailed scenarios that more closely replicate the feel of mystery shows and movies .
Although you can convert scenarios from other systems to GUMSHOE and vice versa , adventures made for GUMSHOE have their own distinct feeling , and work differently in play .
The game does much more than correct this particular glitch .
That said …
After having written GUMSHOE , I ’m even more certain that its core idea is needed , because now people approach me at conventions to share horror stories of games that stalled on them for precisely the reason you mention .
At Gen Con a player came up to the Pelgrane booth to share his experience in a game he was in just hours before .
It was a fantasy game , and the GM had set up the entire adventure so that it started with a Perception roll .
Everyone blew the check .
The party was unable to take the necessary action to start the story .
So the GM just sat there flummoxed , without a fallback plan .
Suffering ensued for all .
I guess you could say that this was a bad GM , but I do n’t see it that way .
He was using the rules of his game as they are written .
As the rules of almost all traditional RPGs with information - gathering skills are written .
If being a good GM requires you to know by a process of osmosis to ignore what many , many rule books explicitly or implicitly tell you to do , it ’s a miracle that we have any good GMs at all .
My job as an RPG game designer is to increase the pool of skilled GMs , and to decrease the length of the learning curve you have to undergo to become one .
If it is true that this technique has always been a part of our unwritten oral lore , it ’s about time that it got written down and recognized .
But of course I ’d argue that it has n’t been part of our unwritten oral lore .
What happens in the vast majority of these cases is not the GUMSHOE way .
The GM does n’t provides the information automatically .
He allows the players to roll , because that ’s what the rules suggest .
The vast majority of GMs and players do what the rules tell them to .
When the players then blow the roll , the GM frantically improvises for five to twenty minutes to come up with some other way to get them the information they need to move forward .
Then , after wasting all that time , frustrating the players , and making them feel that their characters are incompetent , they finally get permission to advance the plot .
Which they should have had all along .
What GUMSHOE really does in practice is eliminate those blocks of useless and annoying workaround .
You can then fill that time with a more detailed and involved mystery , shifting investigative play from the question of whether you gather the information to what you do with it .
Stargazer :
Or they argue that the same can happen in Esoterrorists when a General Skill roll fails .
Robin :
In instances where a General Skill use is necessary to move forward in the story , the rules advise you to pick the most appropriate of the following techniques :
Require a spend from the character ’s ability pool , rather than calling for a roll .
Frame the roll so that it determines how costly the success will be , rather than whether the character succeeds or fails .
Stargazer :
What can be done if the players lack an important Investigative Skill ?
Robin : Character generation works to ensure that every skill appears in every group of PCs .
Stargazer : Especially in a horror game I like when the rules take the back seat .
From what I ’ve seen so far the GUMSHOE rules succeed at achieving that in most cases , but especially when Investigational Skills are concerned I fear that players may be tempted to just list their skills instead of describing what their characters do .
What can GMs and players do to avoid that ?
Robin :
This is a common misconception that we did n’t anticipate , and that frankly I ’m still puzzled by .
The process by which you describe what you ’re doing in a scene and what skills you use is no different in GUMSHOE than in any other investigative game .
You do n’t go into a Call of Cthulhu scene and simply start barking out the names of your skills from your character sheet , and you do n’t do it in GUMSHOE either .
The only difference is that in GUMSHOE you skip the part where you roll .
You go straight to the bit where the GM tells you what you ’ve found .
Players still have to describe what they ’re doing to gather the information .
Traditional game :
GM : At the bottom of the creaking wooden steps , you nearly trip over a desiccated human corpse .
Player :
How recently dead is it ?
GM : You ’re using your Medicine skill ?
Player : Yeah .
GM : Okay , make a check .
Player [ rolls ] : I succeed .
GM : It ’s been down here for decades , you reckon .
GUMSHOE version :
GM : At the bottom of the creaking wooden steps , you nearly trip over a desiccated human corpse .
Player :
How recently dead is it ?
GM : You have Medicine , right ?
Player : Yeah .
GM : It ’s been down here for decades , you reckon .
In neither case do you get this :
GM : You walk down the creaking wooden steps .
Player : Medicine !
Bureaucracy !
Oral History !
Physics !
Theology !
There ’s nothing about GUMSHOE that in practice inspires players to do this ridiculous thing .
Why do n’t they ?
Because it ’s ridiculous .
In some cases a clue will be immediately apparent to a GUMSHOE character who has a given skill , but that ’s even more seamless here than in a traditional investigative game .
Traditional game :
GM : Opening the trap door , you see a gigantic crypt under the farmhouse basement .
Who has Architecture ?
Player : I do .
GM : Roll it .
Player [ rolls ] : I succeed .
GM : Curiously , the chamber shows all the stylistic elements of the crypt beneath a 10th century Romanesque cathedral .
GUMSHOE :
GM : Opening the trap door , you see a gigantic crypt under the farmhouse basement .
[ looks on his cheat sheet to see who has Architecture ]
McWhorter , you see that it has all the stylistic elements of a crypt from a 10th century Romanesque cathedral .
Of course , the two traditional examples above could also go as follows :
GM : At the bottom of the creaking wooden steps , you nearly trip over a desiccated human corpse .
Player :
How recently dead is it ?
GM : You ’re using your Medicine skill ?
Player : Yeah .
GM : Okay , make a check .
Player [ rolls ] : I fail .
GM : [ shrugs ]
It ’s hard to tell .
Traditional game :
GM : Opening the trap door , you see a gigantic crypt under the farmhouse basement .
Who has Architecture ?
Player : I do .
GM : Roll it .
Player [ rolls ] : I fail .
GM : Never mind .
Are either of these outcomes interesting ?
Nope .
Then why allow them ?
Stargazer :
As I understand it , scenarios for the GUMSHOE system require a lot of preparation by the GM .
Especially GMs with a job , family and perhaps even kids usually prefer games that can be played with short prep times .
What can be done to run a GUMSHOE game with minor prep time aside from relying on commercial scenarios ?
Robin :
One of the unavoidable , intrinsic facts about investigative scenarios ( aside from those where the group improvises an answer , Inspectres - style ) is that story plotting is hard , and mystery plotting is even harder .
You have to work out what the adversaries originally did and how they did it , which establishes the mystery in the first place .
( I call this the backplot . )
Then you have to work out how the heroes uncover the mystery .
So you have to plot in two directions , and it has to make sense , because the players are applying their sense of logic to it — in a more ruthlessly engaged way than the passive consumers of a novel or TV show .
Another challenge unique to gaming is the need for multiple routes to the solution of the mystery .
The players must move the plot forward rather than being led through it .
Creating a backplot and multiple potential forward plots , and having them withstand logical scrutiny is just plain tough .
That ’s why adventures for investigative games sell well , when adventures for other games tend not to .
To create your own fun adventure for an action - oriented game , you just have to work out some fight scenes and then find a way to string them together .
Mysteries are way harder and always will be .
That said , an upcoming product does address this problem .
It ’s my upcoming Trail of Cthulhu sourcebook , The Armitage Files .
It shows you how to improvise suitable mystery stories on the fly , using elements found in a series of mysterious handouts available to the players .
You could equally well use these techniques with The Esoterrorists , using as source elements either sections of The Esoterror Fact Book , or a collection of disturbing real - life news clippings .
We got really great playtest feedback from the groups who tried this .
The questions they raised helped us enormously as we beefed up even further the advice on improvisation techniques as they relate to mystery plotting .
Stargazer : Kenneth Hite ’s “ Trail of Cthulhu ” is another game using the rules you created .
How much where you involved in the creation of that game ?
And can you tell us about the changes made to the system ?
Robin :
The core rules text in that book is largely by me , adapted from its appearance in The Esoterrorists and Fear Itself .
I also acted as a consultant on that project , advising Ken as needed .
The most obvious adjustment to the game lies in the ability list , so we get classic Call Of Cthulhu abilities like Library Use and lose the more modern ones , to mesh with the game ’s 1930s setting .
Occupations are adapted from CoC .
They package together a list of appropriate abilities with an archetypal identity , like dilettante or private investigator .
Ken bent the Drives from Fear Itself , which ensure that the PCs behave like characters in the horror genre , to his squamous Lovecraftian ends .
The slickest new wrinkle , which I admit I had to be talked into at first , is the division of the characters ’ mental health into Stability ( which appears in the other games , too ) and Sanity .
The first measures your ability to function rationally in the world .
The second shows your exposure to the shattering existential truths of the mythos .
So you can be highly functional in a practical sense and still want to sacrifice helpless victims to the dread god Azazoth .
This finally explains , in rules terms , your archetypal evil cultists , who are cunning and self - protective but at the same time dangerous psychopaths .
Stargazer : During my research for this interview I discovered that there ’s actually a soundtrack for both “ Trail of Cthulhu ” and “ Esoterrorists ” by James Semple .
When I run roleplaying games I usually use background music to set the mood .
This is especially effective in horror games .
Do you use music as a GM , too , and if so , what kind of music would you recommend for Esoterrorists ?
Robin : I have a folder full of ominous music I use for modern horror games , which I play on random .
Horror movie soundtracks , along with the occasional bit of atonal modernist classical music , go a long way to freaking players out on a subliminal level .
Certain electronica tracks are also suitably unnerving .
My favorites are Ennio Morricone ’s horror soundtracks from the sixties and seventies .
Look for Gothic Dramas ( Drammi Gotici ) ; An Ennio Morricone – Dario Argento Trilogy ; and the later Stendhal Syndrome .
Other soundtracks from the classic era of Italian horror by Goblin or Stelvio Cipriani also fit the bill .
The tomandandy soundtrack to The Mothman Prophecies soundtrack is also worth the trouble to track down .
Stargazer : Before coming to some other subjects , can you please tell us what your further plans regarding the GUMSHOE system are ?
Will there be more Esoterrorist supplements in the future ?
Robin : Pelgrane Press honcho Simon Rogers is the one who makes the tough decisions as to the degrees of support each of the GUMSHOE lines can justify .
Trail Of Cthulhu is the best selling line ; the others require harder thinking .
The Esoterrorists is continuing to pick up steam even now , and I think The Esoterror Fact Book did better than expected .
I would n’t be surprised to see Simon commission the occasional scenario for it , perhaps as PDF - only products .
Stargazer : Can you give us some details on “ Fear Itself ” and “ Mutant City Blues ” ?
What ’s the main difference between Esoterrorists and Fear Itself for example ?
Robin : In The Esoterrorists , you ’re a competent agent up against sinister occult forces and their sophisticated , conspiratorial human minions .
It ’s horror adventure following the same structure as Supernatural , Fringe , or The X - Files , with a dash of Tom Clancy or John Le Carre thrown in for good measure .
Fear Itself is more typical horror , where ordinary people face ( and flee from ) serial killers , abominations from the outer dark , and sundry supernatural threats .
It ’s what you ’d use to evoke The Ring , The Grudge , Nightmare On Elm Street , or Jennifer ’s Body .
Stargazer : How do the mutant powers in Mutant City Blues work ?
Robin :
For the superhero genre to mesh with procedural mystery , all of the superpowers have to be explicable and predictable .
You ca n’t do a proper locked room mystery in the Marvel or DC universes , because there are too many wacky possibilities for what might have happened .
There ’s super - science , magic , mutant powers , and a ton of other power sources to account for .
Every hero and villain ’s power works differently .
So in MCB , you have a world where all the powers come from the same source — an unexplained mutation event that took place ten years earlier .
One per cent of the world ’s population now has a mutant power .
The original event happened long enough ago that science , including forensic science , has nailed down the limitations of the various powers .
Everyone capable of spitting acid or crawling walls does it in exactly the same way .
Also , all of the powers appear in a set order in the altered genome .
A map of these powers called the Quade Diagram appears both as a world and a game artifact .
In the world , the PCs , members of the Heightened Crime Investigative Unit of your chosen city , carry around a laminated card bearing a copy of the diagram .
If powers are far apart on the diagram , they ’re very unlikely to be possessed by the same character .
So if your crime scene shows signs of mutant webbing and that a light blast was used , you know you ’re dealing with at least two separate perpetrators , because those powers are too far apart on the diagram to appear in a single individual .
In the game , you use the Quade Diagram during character creation , as you choose your character ’s mutant powers .
You start at any point on the chart .
Powers adjacent to one you already possess cost the fewest build points .
Some connections between powers are more tenuous than others and cost more to bridge .
It also costs you to skip a power .
Sometimes as you connect powers you may pick up a defect , a latent propensity for a disorder that may become serious and possibly hamper your police career as you suffer stress on the job .
For example , if you choose both Telekinesis and Force Field , you may develop a form of late - onset autism during play .
This is MCB ’s equivalent of the spiral into madness you get in horror games .
Here it provides a basis for the sorts of personal storylines you see in TV cop dramas .
The powers are either treated as general or investigative abilities .
You buy pools of points with them , and these limit what you can do with them and how often .
The investigative abilities are always alternate or optional means to information .
Unlike the standard investigative abilities , the scenario designer can’t assume that any given mutant information gathering power is available to every group , so no core clue can depend solely on one of them .
Stargazer : Aside from GUMSHOE you have created quite a few games and supplements during your career .
Recently you co-authored the D&D 4th Edition Dungeon Masters Guide 2 and your “ Robin ’s Laws of Good Game Mastering ” is pretty much required reading for any serious GM .
Can you tell us a bit about your other works and what has been your favorite project so far ?
Robin : I ’ve been working as a full - time freelance writer since 1992 , and in that time have written many hobby game products as well as six novels , various short stories , and even a few comic books .
By dint of its gigantic market share , any project I do for Dungeons and Dragons snares a much wider audience than anything else .
The Robin ’s Laws book has had a surprisingly strong influence and following over the years , and I was pleased to be able to fold some of its insights into the roleplaying mothership while working on the 3rd edition Dungeon Masters Guide II .
Some of these ideas were picked up by James Wyatt as he wrote the first 4E DMG , which gets us back to the point about injecting ideas into the bloodstream of gaming .
My contributions to the 4E DMG2 include more advanced techniques for GMs ready to experiment with with collaborative input into their ongoing storytelling .
I ’ve been bowled over by the positive reaction to them within the D&D community .
Asking a prolific creator to pick a favorite project is like asking a parent to point out his best kid .
Sometimes the less - known items , like Rune , the video - game inspired game of competitive Viking mayhem , exert an influence on other designers .
Others capture the gamer imagination , like Feng Shui , the game inspired by Hong Kong action movies .
Right now I ’m very happy to see GUMSHOE taking off .
I ’m also extremely proud of the freshly released HeroQuest 2 .
It ’s now a generic game and not solely devoted to Greg Stafford ’s classic Glorantha setting .
It sets out to help GMs tell stories using the same rhythms , devices and decision - making trees employed by authors and screenwriters , while at the same time remaining true to the linear , collective nature of the roleplaying form .
The new version , from Moon Design , is what the game was always meant to be , improved not only by a greater focus on its core intentions , but also years of hindsight .
Stargazer : Back in the day , what was the first RPG you ever played and what made you enter the “ industry ” ?
Robin : I first played D&D at the age of 13 or 14 after discovering the blue box version in a tourist trap gift shop while on family holiday .
Within months we were on to Advanced Dungeons and Dragons , with me as the DM .
Even before that , I always saw myself as a writer .
However , I never considered roleplaying as a market for my work until many years later .
I wound up falling into it by happenstance , basically .
While in university , I started up a play - by - mail game by leaving handbills up around campus .
Through that I struck up a correspondence with Spike Y. Jones , who is now a freelance editor .
He was a participant in an APA ( amateur press association ) called Alarums & Excursions , and inveigled me into contributing .
For those unfamiliar with the APA concept , it was a mimeographed fanzine that had a sort of pre-Internet forum vibe to it .
Contributors would append to their primary content comments on each other ’s past entries , with a month ’s time delay in between .
Through A&E , I wound up corresponding with Jonathan Tweet when he and Mark Rein * Hagen were setting up their first company , Lion Rampant .
Eventually , at a time when Jonathan had set aside his professional gaming ambitions , I mailed him some world background material for his home campaign , which was inspired in part by an A&E article I ’d written positing a William S. Burroughs RPG .
This game , which he intentionally created to be unpublishable , was inevitably published , as Over the Edge .
The material I ’d casually mailed to him appeared in the book essentially verbatim .
At about the same time , Steve Jackson contacted me out of the blue to see if I wanted to turn the bizarre tribal horror - fantasy game I was describing in A&E into a GURPS supplement .
Conceived without regard to its commercial appeal , it became the legendarily strange GURPS Fantasy II : Adventures
In the Madlands .
Because the game industry was and is small , other publishers heard that I might be worth working with .
They sought me out and before I knew it , writing gaming material became my job , as it remains today .
Stargazer : I am sure a lot of people are very interested to read your answer on this question :
When can we expect the next installment of your “ See Page XX ” column and are there plans to release more of your column articles in a similar format as the first 24 columns ( which are available on RPGNow ) ?
Robin : I write See Page XX , but Simon is the scheduling guru .
New issues tend to coincide with Pelgrane Press news and releases and have been more frequent of late .
I ’m happy to know that someone enjoyed the columns as PDF collections .
It ’s Simon ’s call , but I ’d be glad to see the PDF anthologies continue .
For 10 years I 've been part of what the record and film industry invariably call the " information wants to be free " crowd .
In all that time , I 've never heard anyone – apart from an entertainment executive – use that timeworn cliche .
" Information wants to be free " ( IWTBF hereafter ) is half of Stewart Brand 's famous aphorism , first uttered at the Hackers Conference in Marin County , California ( where else ? ) , in 1984 : " On the one hand information wants to be expensive , because it 's so valuable .
The right information in the right place just changes your life .
On the other hand , information wants to be free , because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time .
So you have these two fighting against each other . "
This is a chunky , chewy little koan , and as these go , it 's an elegant statement of the main contradiction of life in the " information age " .
It means , fundamentally , that the increase in information 's role as an accelerant and source of value is accompanied by a paradoxical increase in the cost of preventing the spread of information .
That is , the more IT you have , the more IT generates value , and the more information becomes the centre of your world .
But the more IT ( and IT expertise ) you have , the easier it is for information to spread and escape any proprietary barrier .
As an oracular utterance predicting the next 40 years ' worth of policy , business and political fights , you can hardly do better .
But it 's time for it to die .
It 's time for IWTBF to die because it's become the easiest , laziest straw man for Hollywood 's authoritarian bullies to throw up as a justification for the monotonic increase of surveillance , control , and censorship in our networks and tools .
I can imagine them saying : " These people only want network freedom because they believe that ' information wants to be free ' .
They pretend to be concerned about freedom , but the only ' free ' they care about is ' free of charge . ' "
But this is just wrong .
" Information wants to be free " has the same relationship to the digital rights movement that " kill whitey " has to the racial equality movement : a thoughtless caricature that replaces a nuanced , principled stand with a cartoon character .
Calling IWTBF the ideological basis of the movement is like characterising bra burning as the primary preoccupation of feminists ( in reality , the number of bras burned by feminists in the history of the struggle for gender equality appears to be zero , or as close to it as makes no difference ) .
So what do digital rights activists want , if not " free information ? "
They want open access to the data and media produced at public expense , because this makes better science , better knowledge , and better culture – and because they already paid for it with their tax and licence fees .
They want to be able to quote , cite and reference earlier works because this is fundamental to all critical discourse .
They want to be able to build on earlier creative works in order to create new , original works because this is the basis of all creativity , and every work they wish to make fragmentary or inspirational use of was , in turn , compiled from the works that went before it .
They want to be able to use the network and their computers without mandatory surveillance and spyware installed under the rubric of " stopping piracy " because censorship and surveillance are themselves corrosive to free thought , intellectual curiosity and an open and fair society .
They want their networks to be free from greedy corporate tampering by telecom giants that wish to sell access to their customers to entertainment congloms , because when you pay for a network connection , you 're paying to have the bits you want delivered to you as fast as possible , even if the providers of those bits do n't want to bribe your ISP .
They want the freedom to build and use tools that allow for the sharing of information and the creation of communities because this is the key to all collaboration and collective action — even if some minority of users of these tools use them to take pop songs without paying .
IWTBF has an elegant compactness and a mischievous play on the double - meaning of " free , " but it does more harm than good these days .
Better to say , " The internet wants to be free . "
Or , more simply : " People want to be free . "
In the classic teen movie Animal House there comes a moment when the ne'er - do - well students of the Delta fraternity finally realise their pranks have gone too far .
Faced with expulsion from university , the most violent , antisocial drunkard of the group , Bluto Blutarsky ( John Belushi ) , gives one last rousing , rambling speech to his crestfallen comrades .
" Nothing is over until we decide it is , " he yells .
" Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor ?
Hell , no ! "
The other students look on confused .
Bluto leads a charge but nobody follows .
However , they soon fall in line after the fraternity 's leader , the far more respectable , presentable , all - round - cad , Otter ( Tim Matheson ) , backs Bluto 's call to arms against the university authorities .
" Bluto 's right , " he says .
" Psychotic , but absolutely right .
We gotta take these bastards … I think we have to go all out .
I think that this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody 's part . "
The Republican party , in particular , and American conservatism in general , have taken to operating in a similar manner to the Delta fraternity – increasingly reckless , anarchic and strident .
Faced with defeat they respond with desperation .
Only where the Deltas were motivated by ribaldry , conservatives are driven by rage .
On the one hand there are the Blutos – characterised by their contempt for even the most basic facts .
Their assertions are often not only verifiably false but patently ridiculous .
The very people who claim that Obama is a Muslim were the ones who fumed about his relationship with Reverend Jeremiah Wright , his pastor in Chicago .
Muslims do n't have pastors .
Last year the Investor 's Business Daily claimed that if the renowned scientist Stephen Hawking were British he would be dead : Hawking is British and alive .
These falsehoods are not limited to the fringes .
A recent Harris poll reveals that a majority of Republicans believe Obama is a Muslim and a socialist who " wants to turn over the sovereignty of the United States to a one - world government " .
A Daily Kos poll in January showed that about two - thirds of Republicans either believe or are not sure that Obama is " a racist who hates white people " , and more than half believe or are not sure that he was not born in the US and that he wants the terrorists to win .
So long as these people breathe the ever more fetid air of their own ecosystem – oxygen provided by Fox News – then these contradictions are of little concern or consequence to them .
Cognitive dissonance is not the exception but the rule .
But there is menace in this madness .
A few weeks ago , shortly before the passing of the healthcare vote , conservative blogger Solomon Forell tweeted : " We 'll surely get over a bullet 2 Barack Obama 's head ! "
He added : " The Next American with a Clear Shot should drop Obama like a bad habit .
4 get Blacks or his claim to be Black .
Turn on Barack Obama . "
Last week a man was detained for issuing death threats to Democratic senator Patty Murray .
Speaking in Phoenix on a Tea Party tour , Joe the Plumber , recently spelt out his plan for dealing with illegal immigration : " Put a fence in and start shooting . "
So much for the Blutos .
Far from reining them in , the Republican leadership increasingly reflects their excesses .
Absent any legislative agenda or coherent ideological approach , they have spent the last two years crafting " a really futile and stupid gesture … on somebody 's part " that Otter would be proud of .
Small government is a legitimate philosophical and political position .
But in the hands of people who voted to bloat the deficit and unleash a huge state - grab of civil liberties , it is shorn of credibility .
It is n't government they do n't like ; it 's Democrats in government .
So congressmen scream " liar " at the president and " baby killer " at their colleagues ; senators repeat myths about death panels ; and legislators stoke up crowds from the balconies during the healthcare debate .
On Friday at the Southern Republican Leadership conference , Sarah Palin repeated her slogan : " Do n't Retreat , Reload . "
This time she insisted it was " not a call for violence " .
The fact she would have to make that explicit tells us something about how dire things have become .
The potential for this kind of rhetoric to produce an unthinkable calamity should not be underestimated .
Last year a Homeland Security report , Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fuelling Resurgence in Radicalisation and Recruitment , concluded : " The economic downturn and the election of the first African - American president present unique drivers for rightwing radicalisation and recruitment . "
Such people are on the fringes .
But those fringes are growing .
In any case , it only takes one angry person with a gun to make the difference .
If such a person were to emerge , they would not be acting alone .
Thousands of others , from the blogosphere to Congress , have colluded in creating an alternative reality that would explain , if not justify , their actions .
After all , if Obama truly were a foreign - born , white - hating , terrorist sympathiser who has usurped the presidency , drastic action would make sense .
Meanwhile , the brazen disregard for basic facts goes all the way to the top .
The 2008 presidential contender John McCain recently insisted he never considered himself a " maverick " , even though one of his books is subtitled The Education of an American Maverick , and he called himself " the original maverick " in campaign ads .
It used to be assumed this was the tail wagging the dog .
But by increments it is turning into an entirely new breed of dog .
Establishment Republicans are not running away from Palin 's wing of the party but towards it .
McCain needed her endorsement to fight off a Tea Party challenge in Arizona .
This trend is not new .
Ever since the Republican election rallies of 2008 , where Obama 's name provoked screams of " traitor " and " terrorist " , this dialectic between leadership and base , margins and mainstream , populist reaction and legislative response , has been all too evident .
Far from subsiding , the contradictions have sharpened .
Whereas in 2008 McCain grabbed the microphone from an audience member 's hand and corrected her after she said she did n't trust Obama " because he 's an Arab " , the metaphorical mic has now been returned to her and she has been ushered to centre stage .
Having pitted fear against hope and lost , the Republican leadership has come up with no better alternative than to keep doubling down on fear .
None of this puts food on Blutos ' tables , but it does keep them angry .
For those who peddle in rumour and angst , this is a lucrative market indeed .
In a world where facts do n't matter , their fears can never truly be assuaged .
Quite how reality will intrude into this parallel universe is as of yet unclear .
But it will .
Now that healthcare legislation has been passed , people will see that the state does not kill their grandmothers and most Republican voters will see their healthcare costs fall .
This week there will be an anti-tax rally – most of the protesters on it will actually see their taxes lowered by the Obama administration .
And how would the Republican party explain to most of its supporters that while their living standards stagnated or declined under George Bush they are set to improve under Obama ?
As Otter explained to one of the fraternity after trashing his brother 's car : " You fucked up ... you trusted us ! "

Deputy First Minister Minister Martin McGuinness who joined several hundred people in Derry 's Guild Hall Square in protest at the raid on the aid flotilla which was travelling to Gaza
Israeli commandos today stormed six ships carrying hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists on an aid mission to the blockaded Gaza Strip , killing at least 19 people and wounding dozens more .
Israel said a total of five soldiers were wounded , two seriously , including at least one hit by live fire .
Two of the dead activists had fired at soldiers with pistols , the army said .
" On board the ship we found weapons prepared in advance and used against our forces , " declared Israel 's deputy foreign minister , Danny Ayalon .
" The organisers ' intent was violent , their method was violent and the results were unfortunately violent .
Israel regrets any loss of life and did everything to avoid this outcome . "
However the tough Israeli response drew condemnations from Turkey , France and the UN's Mideast envoy , while Greece suspended a military exercise with Israel and postponed a visit by Israel 's air force chief .
About 10,000
Turks also marched from Israel 's Consulate in Istanbul toward the city 's main square , shouting slogans denouncing Israel .
The protesters had earlier tried storm the Consulate building but were blocked by police .
The Israeli ambassadors in Sweden , Spain , Denmark and Greece were summoned for meetings , and the French foreign minister called for an investigation .
In neighbouring Jordan , hundreds demonstrated in the capital Amman to protest the Israeli action and demand that their government breaks diplomatic relations with the Jewish state .
Israeli security forces were on alert across the country .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the Israeli " aggression , " declared three days of mourning across the West Bank and called on the UN Security Council and Arab League to hold emergency sessions on the incident .
The United Nations expressed " shock " and condemned the killings .
" We are in contact with the Israeli authorities to express our deep concern and to seek a full explanation , " said a statement from the highest - ranking UN official in the region , Robert Serry .
A reporter on one of the boats said the Israelis fired at the vessel before boarding it , but the Israelis claimed they only opened fire after being attacked by activists with sticks , knives and live fire .
The activists were headed to Gaza on a mission designed to draw attention to a three - year - old Israeli blockade of the coastal territory .
Israel imposed the blockade after Hamas militants took power there .
" It 's disgusting that they have come on board and attacked civilians .
We are civilians , " said Greta Berlin , a spokeswoman for the Free Gaza movement , which organised the flotilla .
Speaking from the east Mediterranean island of Cyprus , she said she had lost contact with the flotilla in the early hours .
Israel had declared it would not allow the ships to reach Gaza and had offered to transfer the aid to Gaza from an Israeli port .
Israeli naval commandos raided the ships while they were in international waters after ordering them to stop about 80 miles from Gaza 's coast , according to a pro-Palestinian activist in Greece involved in the aid mission .
A Turkish website showed video of pandemonium on board one of the ships , with activists in orange life jackets running around as some tried to help an activist apparently unconscious on the deck .
The site also showed video of an Israeli helicopter flying overhead and Israeli warships nearby .
Turkey 's NTV showed activists beating one Israeli soldier with sticks as he rappelled from a helicopter onto one of the boats .
The al - Jazeera satellite channel reported from the Turkish ship leading the flotilla that Israeli navy forces fired at the ship and boarded it , wounding the captain .
The Israeli military said troops only opened fire after encountering unexpected resistance from the activists .
Activists attacked troops with knives and iron rods , and one activist wrested a serviceman 's weapon .
A total of four soldiers were wounded , including at least one hit by live fire , the army said .
Two of the dead activists had fired at soldiers with pistols , the army said .
" They planned this attack , " said Israeli military spokeswoman Lt. Col.
Avital Leibovitch .
" Our soldiers were injured from these knives and sharp metal objects ... as well as from live fire . "
The ships were being towed to the Israeli port of Ashdod , and the wounded were evacuated by helicopter to Israeli hospitals , officials said .
There were no details on the identities of the casualties , or on the conditions of some of the more prominent people on board , including 1976 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Corrigan Maguire of Northern Ireland , European legislators and Holocaust survivor Hedy Epstein , 85 .
The Free Gaza Movement is an international group of pro-Palestinian activists that claims the blockade , imposed three years ago after the militant Islamic Hamas group overran Gaza , is unjust and a violation of international law .
Organisers included people affiliated with the International Solidarity Movement , a pro-Palestinian group that often sends international activists into battle zones , and the IHH , a Turkish aid group that Israel accuses of having terrorist links .
News of the attack sparked violent protests in Turkey , which had unofficially supported the aid mission and has been vocally critical of Israeli military operations against Palestinians in Gaza .
Police blocked dozens of stone - throwing protesters who tried to storm the Israeli consulate in Istanbul .
The Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned the Israeli raid and said it was summoning the Israeli ambassador for an " urgent explanation " .
It says Israel violated international law and will suffer consequences .
The flotilla of three cargo ships and three passenger ships carrying 10,000 tons of aid and 700 activists was carrying items that Israel bars from reaching Gaza , like cement and other building materials .
The activists said they also were carrying hundreds of electric - powered wheelchairs , prefabricated homes and water purifiers to the territory 's 1.5 million residents .
" We did not want to see confrontation , " said Mark Regev , a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who is in Canada .
" We made repeated offers to the boats that they come to the ( Israeli ) port of Ashdod unload the humanitarian cargo , and we guaranteed to pass all humanitarian items through the crossings to the Gaza Strip .
Unfortunately , they rejected our offers and chose the path of confrontation . "
The head of the Gaza Hamas government , Ismail Haniyeh , condemned the " brutal " Israeli attack .
" We call on the secretary - general of the UN , Ban Ki-moon , to shoulder his responsibilities to protect the safety of the solidarity groups who were on board these ships and to secure their way to Gaza , " Haniyeh said .
The flotilla began the journey from international waters off the coast of Cyprus on yesterday afternoon after two days of delays .
After nightfall , three Israeli navy missile boats left their base in Haifa , steaming out to sea to confront the ships .
Two hours later , Israel Radio broadcast a recording of one of the missile boats warning the flotilla not to approach Gaza .
" If you ignore this order and enter the blockaded area , the Israeli navy will be forced to take all the necessary measures in order to enforce this blockade , " the radio message continued .
This is the ninth time that the Free Gaza movement has tried to ship in humanitarian aid to Gaza since August 2008 .

The beleaguered Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs boasted that it was making tens of millions of dollars of profits daily by betting against its own clients ' investments , according to internal emails released yesterday by a US senator .
The annual report of the bank , which is currently facing fraud charges in the US , denied that it had generated enormous revenues by wagering on the US housing crisis .
Yet an email apparently from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein to his colleagues says : " Of course we did n't dodge the mortgage mess .
We lost money , then we made more than we lost because of ' shorts ' [ bets that the market would get even worse ] . "
The damning material from the senate 's permanent subcommittee on investigations , which is reviewing the role of Wall Street banks in the financial crisis , was posted on the website of its chairman , Senator Carl Levin .
It will be used in what promises to be an incendiary public hearing on Tuesday when Blankfein is scheduled to testify in front of the subcommittee .
In a statement , Goldman stood by earlier claims that it never made significant profits out of the housing market and said that the emails proved nothing .

Hundreds of Israeli Arabs took part in mass demonstrations across Israel on Monday , to protest against the Israel Navy 's deadly raid on a Gaza - bound aid convoy earlier in the day .
Angry Palestinians were hurling rocks at police forces positioned near the Old City gates .
A handful of protesters were arrested in the northern town of Umm al - Fahm as the demonstrations turned violent .

Protests were also held over the course of the afternoon in the Israeli Arab cities of Acre , Sakhnin , Arabe and Shfaram .
There was no word of violence or disruption in those areas .
A spontaneous demonstration erupted in Nazareth as Israel 's law enforcement authorities prepared to face an anticipated wave of violence after Israel shot dead at least 10 pro-Palestinian activists aboard a Gaza - bound aid convoy .
The protest in the Arab - populated town in northern Israel was the first mass response to news in the early hours of the morning that Israeli commandos had fired on flotilla passengers as they approached a maritime exclusion zone imposed by Israel off Gaza .
Reports in the Arabic - language press on Monday that Raed Salah , head of the northern branch of the Israeli - Arab Islamic Movement , had been seriously wounded sparked widespread anger among the country 's Arab minority - some 20 per cent of the population .
IDF officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Haaretz that Salah was alive - but offered no other details on his condition .
Salah 's deputy , Kamel Khatib , said in a radio interview that there was still no clear indication of Salah 's state .
Khatib said that if emerged Salah had been killed , Israel would be directly responsible .
Local authorities in Arab - populated areas in Israel on Monday declared a general strike for the following day .
Israeli -Arab leaders condemned Israel 's handling of the interception .
Knesset member Mohammed Barakeh offered sardonic praise for the government , congratulating Defense Minister Ehud Barak on his " decisive victory of the army of pirates over the flotilla of civil liberty " .
Barakeh added : " Any government that puts itself outside international and humanitarian law will consign itself to the garbage can of history .
MK Taleb al - Sana said the operation had " exposed the ugly face of Zionism , the violence and aggression of the government of Israel " .
Sana described the interception as an act of state terror against a humanitarian mission and called for Israel 's leaders to be tried for war crimes .
" This event proves you do n't have to be a German to be a Nazi , " he said .
By lunchtime , police were preparing for disturbances in Arab - majority districts in the north of the country , as well as around the Al - Aqsa Mosque atop the Temple Mount in Jerusalem , the harbor at Ashdod and hospitals across the country where casualties are being treated .
" At this moment we have to act with restraint and complete control , so as not to inflame the situation needlessly , ' said police commander David Cohen .
The internal security minister , Yitzhak Aharonovitch , also held emergency planning meetings with police , saying that while he hope to maintain calm , law enforcement agencies were prepared for any eventually .
The Arab Higher Monitoring Committee , which represents Israel Arab minority , called on Israeli forces to stay out of Arab areas so as not to provoke violence .
" The government of Israel and the police carry responsibility for the safety of Arab citizens that will demand the right to protest against the police of the government and defense ministry that was carrying a message of peace to Gaza . "
Hezbollah demands ' international punishment ' over Gaza flotilla deaths '
The Hezbollah guerrilla group on Monday said Israel 's action against Gaza - bound aid ships in which at least 10 people were killed , was a " terrorist act that deserves international punishment " .
Israeli commandos stormed the ships before dawn and at least 10 pro-Palestinian activists on board were killed , unleashing fierce criticism from Israel 's friends and enemies .
Israel put its forces on high alert on its borders with Lebanon , Syria and the Gaza Strip , as well as around Jerusalem and the West Bank , following the incident .
" Israel 's kidnapping of civilian hostages from international waters and their arrest constitutes a barbaric aggression and Israel bears complete responsibility if anything happens to them , " Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah told Reuters .
" Any delay by the Security Council in moving quickly against this Israeli crime constitutes a cover-up .
This never would have happened without international and U.S. silence over the Gaza blockade and the crimes that Israel commits against civilians . "
Hundreds of people protested against Israel in Beirut and Palestinian refugee camps across the country also witnessed several demonstrations during which protesters chanted anti-Israeli slogans and raised Palestinian flags .
" We hope they come back safely .
My father is on the ship and he is injured but our blood is not more precious than the blood of all martyred Palestinians , " said Adham Suleiman , the son of Lebanese activist Hani Suleiman , in Beirut .
After the actress Lynn Redgrave learned she had breast cancer in December 2002 , she chose to undergo surgery , followed by a half - year regimen of chemotherapy and radiation .
She also asked her daughter Annabel Clark , then a photography student at Parsons School of Design , if she would photograph the course of treatment and recovery .
It was an idea that had occurred to Annabel as well : while her mother documented the experience in her journal , she would take pictures of the healing process -- and in so doing , become part of that process , for both her mother and herself .

David Cameron may once have poked fun at the social networking site Twitter when he said in a radio interview , " Too many twits make a tw*t " , but yesterday the Conservative Party took a rather different line on the power of the tweet as it announced it had amassed just over 30,000 " followers " on its microsite .
" Thank you for your support -- we have now reached 30,000 followers , " the Tories tweeted .
Indeed , the Conservatives appear to have out - tweeted their rivals : the Labour Party has just over 16,268 followers and the Lib Dems have 19,360 .
While no one is suggesting that voters will consider a party 's following on Twitter when casting their vote , all the parties are only too aware of the importance of social networking sites such as Twitter , Facebook , MySpace and YouTube .
The Labour Party was understandably chuffed , for instance , that Gordon Brown 's speech to Citizens UK became the most viewed video on YouTube in the UK today .
Yet a recent survey of 1,000 respondents by the social media consultants Lewis Communications found a bit of a mixed bag when it came to people 's attitudes to social networking and politics .
Fifty - six per cent of the sample had visited political websites , and 24 per cent thought Twitter an essential communication tool in a democracy .
But while 27 per cent would be encouraged to vote for an MP if contacted by one on social networking sites , 48 per cent would not .
As for the all - important question of fundraising , 30 per cent said they would go online if they wanted to donate cash , while only 12 per cent said they would prefer to donate over the phone .
Little surprise that the Conservative Party has been busily tweeting messages like this one : " Over 70 % of Labour 's donations comes from the unions -- as we raise a record amount from small donations .
Donate now . "
In other politics - meets - social - networking - news , one company has gone to the trouble of ranking the main parties ' political websites not by their impact , depth or even style -- but by how quickly the pages load .
Keynote Systems , which does website performance tuning and the like , has been measuring the responsiveness and reliability of the key political parties ' websites in the run-up to the election .
It found the Lib Dems are out in front with a load time of 0.93 seconds , with the Green Party on 1.12 seconds , the Tories on 1.99 seconds and Labour trailing way behind at 6.42 seconds .
Naturally , high traffic rates can slow websites down as the computers behind the scenes struggle to meet demand , so you might read into these figures that Labour is simply getting the most visitor traffic to its site .
Then again , you might not .

This is the third post in a series : “ Anthony Suau on The Great Recession . ”
American classics : sex and cars .
Detroit has been using glamor and beauty images to sell automobiles since the dawn of the industry .
But in the context of bankruptcies and uncertainty about the future , it feels forced , Suau ’s photo , above , reminiscent of Diane Arbus ’s portrait of the Wade sisters , as she was probing a deeper , darker layer of American culture .
The girls , in fact , were perfectly normal , and grew up to live fruitful lives .
But in her photograph they look like freaks — not because they were freaks , but because Arbus was interested in the freakishness of the normal — an underlying contradiction of the postwar industrial boom .
Reflecting on that period , especially the Sixties , when everything we knew as normal suddenly did n’t look so normal anymore , today ’s auto industry — struggling for survival — feels caught in a time warp .
Detroit seems stuck in that mindset in which sex and steel were used to appeal to the comfort of conformity .
The models are wearing the same dress , the same high - heeled shoes , presenting the cars in the same old way .
It ’s like the thinking remains : if your Dad drove a Chevrolet , you should drive a Chevrolet .
More than fifty years later , that the car companies continue to exemplify this approach is what ’s freakish .
And then , to have attractive women at an auto show is nothing new .
But if the models still look good , using sex to sell cars is more contradictory now .
If the car companies really had faith in this next generation of cars , they would n’t be offering us this anachronism .
With the industry not just floundering , but looking for an entirely new paradigm , the use of the hottest girls to sell the hottest cars is like Detroit trying to convince itself it ’s still viable .

The NYT is reporting that A.I.G. has dismissed Goldman Sachs as an advisor :
“ A.I.G. , the insurance giant that planned to retain Goldman to help reorganize its businesses , has replaced Goldman as its main corporate adviser , according to three people with knowledge of the matter , which was not intended to be public .
Instead , the insurer is turning to Citigroup and Bank of America .
The move is the first in what some analysts warn could be a series of defections among Goldman ’s clients after accusations — vigorously denied by Goldman — that it defrauded customers in a complex mortgage investment . ”
I do n’t buy into the Goldman defections — yet — due to the fraud allegations .
This smells like a little payback for Goldman ’s role in the AIG collapse .
Do n’t get me wrong , Goldie did n’t kill AIG , the insurer committed suicide .
They were were reckless in their embrace of derivatives and had horrific risk management .
As noted in Bailout Nation , the head of AIG FP , Tom Savage , actually said “ The models suggested that the risk was so remote that the fees were almost free money .
Just put it on your books and enjoy . ”
So I do n’t want anyone to think I am blaming Goldie for AIG ’s demise .
But they were the first vulture to arrive at the site of the wounded body , and they began tearing at AIG ’s flesh before it was even carrion .
Almost $ 20 billion in transfers took place from AIG to GS — BEFORE their collapse , BEFORE the bailouts .
The rest of the taxpayer gift — at 100 cents on the dollar — was simply free money .
So , if you were in AIG ’s shoes , and you had an opportunity to kick Goldie when they are stumbling around a bit — why would n’t you give them a swift knee to the groin ?
Payback is a bitch . . .

A bill that aims to ban ethnic studies in Arizona schools was signed into law Tuesday by Gov. Jan Brewer , cheering critics who called such classes divisive and alarming others who said it ’s yet another law targeting Latinos in the state .
The move comes less than 20 days after Brewer signed a controversial immigration bill which has caused widespread protests against the state .
Brewer ’s press office did not return requests for comment Tuesday evening .
HB 2281 bans schools from teaching classes that are designed for students of a particular ethnic group , promote resentment or advocate ethnic solidarity over treating pupils as individuals .
The bill was written to target the Chicano , or Mexican - American , studies program in the Tucson school system , said state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne .
School districts that do n’t comply with the new law could have up to 10 percent of their state funds withheld each month .
Districts have the right to appeal the mandate , which takes effect Dec. 31 .
Tucson Unified School District officials say the classes benefit students and promote critical thinking .
“ We do n’t teach all those ugly things they think we ’re teaching , ” said Judy Burns , the president of the Tucson Unified School District governing board .
She has no intentions of ending the Mexican - American studies program , in which about 3 percent of the district ’s 55,000 students are enrolled .
Horne has been trying to end the program for years , saying the program divides students by race and promotes resentment .
He singled out a history book used in some classes , “ Occupied America : A History of Chicanos , ” by Rodolfo Acuna .
“ To begin with , the title of the book implies to the kids that they live in occupied America , or occupied Mexico , ” Horne said last week in a telephone interview .
Ethnic studies are taught at high schools and colleges nationwide , but the Tucson district ’s officials say its 14 - year - old program is unique because it is districtwide , is offered to grades K - 12 and can satisfy high school graduation requirements .
The program is supported by a court - ordered desegregation budget .

Janine Wedel has done something that far too few anthropolologists do :
She studied powerful people .
Those who rule the world .
In her book “ Shadow Elite “ , she shows how a new system of power and influence has taken hold globally , one that undermines democracy , government , and the free market .
Why went America to war against Iraq ?
More and more “ government work ” is performed by “ shadow elites " : consulting firms , companies , nongovernmental organizations , think tanks etc , rather small circles of powerful people ( she calls them “ flexians " ) who use their interlocking relationships to control public policy without public input .
“ Flexians ” work often for private interests , academia and government at the same time .
The flexians form “ Flex nets " .
They can not be reduced to lobbyists or interest groups .
They are according to a review in the Financial Times defined by four features :
1 ) personalizing bureaucracy , or using personal connections and loyalties to realize goals ;
2 ) privatizing information while branding conviction , or branding the information available only to insiders in this game ;
3 ) juggling roles and representations , or changing spots frequently , wearing the pelt of military leader one day , analyst the next , and concerned citizen the next ;
4 ) relaxing rules at the interstices of official and private institutions , or adjusting accountability and rules that apply to one or more of their pelts from the safety of a seemingly non-aligned position .
One of those flexians is the retired US general Barry McCaffrey , who has been simultaneously a commentator for the media , a consultant to the defence industry and professor .
According to a 2008 exposé in the New York Times , he was one of several former military men who helped to shape public opinion on the Iraq war , while simultaneously having undisclosed ties to the Pentagon .
Wedel ’s book has received quite a lot of media attention since it was released earlier this year .
It was book of the month at Huffington Post ( where she has started writing a weekly column ) and was also reviewed in mainstream media .
She was interviewed both by BBC , Russia Today , MSNBC and Al Jazeera .
It would be interesting to know how she studied the “ shadow elites " .
Has she been on fieldwork ?
I have n’t read all her texts .
But in her newest article in Huffington Post , she explains how she came to understand the game : through her experience studying the mechanisms of power and influence in post - Cold War eastern Europe for about 30 years :
( E ) xamining eastern Europe up close –through its transformations away from communism over the last quarter century –has been excellent preparation for making sense of how a small group of power brokers helped engineer the invasion of Iraq , and more broadly , how a new system of power and influence has taken hold globally , one that , as I write in my book Shadow Elite , undermines democracy , government , and the free market .
In communist Poland , the necessity of getting around the state - controlled system created a society whose lifeblood –just beneath the surface –was vital information , circulated only among friends and trusted colleagues , information that was not publicly available .
Under - the - radar dealings that often played on the margins of legality - this was the norm , not the exception .
(…)
I began to recognize a familiar ( to me ) architecture of power and influence .
I started to follow the networks and overlapping connections in government , foundations , think tanks , and business of a tiny set of neoconservatives - just a dozen or so players I call the “ Neocon core " .
(…)
The playbook of the Neocon core seemed to come straight from that of the top players of transitional eastern Europe .
In both cases , players who already knew each other set up a host of organizations–organizations that seemed more like an extended family franchise than think tank , populated by the same set of individuals .
(…)
And despite a new administration in Washington , not to mention the damage done to their credibility since the Iraq invasion , the Neocon core lives on , because networks like it are self - propelling , multipurpose , and enduring .
And she adds that as a social anthropologist , her “ focus is not on whether the U.S. should have invaded Iraq , but rather how that decision was made , who made it , and what mechanisms of power and influence were used to make it " .
Exactly !
And in Anthropology News february 2010 ( pdf ) she explains why we need an “ ethnographic focus ” on power :
I have concluded that an ethnographic focus is indispensable to sorting out power and influence amid transforming federal governance in the United States , not only under change - of - system conditions such as those found in transitional eastern Europe .
The ethnographic sensibility that enabled scholars of communist and post - communist societies to deal with the complexity , ambiguity and messiness of political and policy processes is ideally suited to examine the interactions between public policy and private interests and the mixing of state , nongovernmental , and business forms that are increasingly preva- lent in the United States and around the world .
By focusing on players and their networks as drivers of governing and policy decisions , these ethnographers have laid the groundwork for badly needed critiques of social science categories such as “ state ” versus “ private , ” “ top - down versus bottom - up , ” and “ centralized ” versus “ decentralized . ”
They have provided a basis for reexamining conventional models that guide so much thinking about politics , policy and power , and yet obfuscate , rather than illuminate , the real system of power and influence .
Her work is a good example of public anthropology .
Her website is really impressive .
There you find a great amount of her publications , both newspaper articles and papers ( even back to pre-internet and pre-computer times ) , a collection of book reviews , TV and radio interviews , interviews related to Shadow elites etc
It is popular to lament about the lack of public anthropology , but anthropologists have been highly visible in matters regarding global financial and power issues , see earlier posts Anthropologist Explores Wall Street Culture , Financial crisis : Anthropologists lead mass demonstration against G20 summit and Used anthropology to predict the financial crisis .
Studies on elites are still not as common as studies on marginalized people , though .
This is not only true for anthropology .
I have to think of a series of great programs at BBC Thinking aloud about white collar crime - a rather neglected topic among sociologists and criminologists as well .
It 's a near - weekly occurrence : HTC , or Motorola , or someone releases a brand - new Android phone .
There are a ton of them !
But really , there are only a few worth buying .
Here are the best Android phones on each carrier .

Choosing an Android phone is just like choosing any other cellphone , except easier :
You 're already onboard with the Android operating system , you 're prepared to shell out for a data plan , and probably have a more specific idea of what you want in a phone than your average buyer .
Accordingly , similar rules apply :
• Do n't buy something that 's going to be obsolete before you 're halfway through your contract .
• Generally , ignore the upfront price — the total tally for your cellphone contract is going to make your smartphone 's $ 200 seem like spare change .
• Look forward .
Google updates their Android software at a breakneck pace .
This is awesome if your phone is ready for the upgrades , and demoralizing if it is n't — and a lot of current handsets are getting left behind .
This has serious implications in terms of app compatibility — do you really want to buy a phone that can't even run Google 's Navigation software ?

So !
The calculus is simple : Buy the Android phone that is objectively one of the best , or you 'll probably regret it .
Here are your choices :
T- Mobile is the grandfather of all things Android .
They had the first phone !
And the second .
( Also , did you know they 're still selling the G1 , right now ?
Nuts . )
It 's weird , then , that their Android line has thinned down into an anemic , uninspiring mishmash of oldish hardware and Android 's few legitimate pariahs .
Luckily , they 've got a savior outside of their official lineup : The Nexus One .

It 's the best Android phone that you can buy today , and that 's saying a lot :
It 's got a 1GHz Snapdragon processor , and beautiful AMOLED screen , Android 2.1 and a bright future for software upgrades , since , after all , it 's the Google Phone .
It retails for $ 180 with contract or $ 530 without , at Google .

If you need a keyboard , go with the Motorola Cliq , at $ 150 .
It 's far from futureproof , though , with and older generation of hardware and a certain delay for software upgrades , since Motorola needs to update their Motoblur software shell for any new OS releases .
Stick with the Nexus One if you can .

Sprint
Sprint rode the crest of the second Android wave , landing the America version of the well - reviewed HTC Hero .
Then , like T - Mobile , their lineup started to look less and less competitive , as phones like the Droid came to market .
Now , they 're back out in front with the HTC Evo , the first 4G handset in the US , and by far the most impressive Android phone available .
Advertisement
Advertisement
It 's got a 4.3 - inch screen , HTC 's generally helpful Sense Android interface , an 8 MP camera , and what the hell , a kickstand .
4 G 's only a selling point if you live within Sprint 's limited WiMax coverage area , but if you do , you can use the Evo 's hotspot feature to share the connection with a handful of other devices over Wi-Fi .
And even without 4G , it 's still king of the hill .
Minor catch :
It 's not out yet .
It 's expected in June , when it 'll probably cost $ 200 — though it could conceivably be higher .
Advertisement
If you need a keyboard , you 're nearly out of luck on Sprint .
You could go with the Samsung Moment , but really , you should n't .
Nut up and deal with the soft keyboard — on a 4.3 - inch screen , it 's really not that big of a deal .
Advertisement
AT&T got into the Android game late , and they started with a spread of mid-level phones , like the Backflip , and soon , the Dell Aero .
But as with T - Mobile , your best option lies outside of AT&T : The AT&T - compatible Nexus One .
Advertisement
But there 's a much larger catch this time around :
It 's $ 530 .
There is no on - contract option , so your phone wo n't be subsidized .
On the plus side , you wo n't be stuck in any kind of contract at all if you 're already an AT&T customer , but still , steep .
Advertisement
So here , your second choice , the Backflip , may seem a bit more compelling .
Not only does it have a keyboard , but it 'll only run you $ 100 , and it 's due for the 2.1 update sooner rather than later .
But again , consider what you 're getting yourself into .
Two years with a phone you do n't really want is n't worth saving a few hundred dollars , and signing a new blood contract with your carrier — you can always resell the Nexus One !

Verizon
Verizon took Android mainstream with the Droid , which , up until the Nexus One came out , was the best Android piece you could buy .
Today , they 've done themselves one better with the HTC Droid Incredible , which matches or beats the Nexus One ( which , by the way , both Sprint and Verizon are due to get sometime soon ) in almost every respect .
Advertisement
Advertisement
It 's got a 480x800 AMOLED screen , a Snapdragon processor ( like the Nexus One ) and an 8 MP camera , to start .
It 's due on April 29th .
Advertisement
If you want a keyboard , though , the original Droid is still a reasonable choice .
Obsolescence is n't something you have to worry about in the near - term , and it 's generally been quick to receive major software updates .
It can be had for significantly under its $ 200 retail price , too .
Advertisement
You may have noticed a theme here :
All of the top phones are made by HTC , and all of these phones share similar spec sheets — in fact , they all run on Qualcomm 's Snapdragon processor , which is , for now , the fastest available .
The downside is a lack of diversity ; the upside , though , is that no single carrier has that much of a hardware advantage , so you should n't feel the need to switch carriers .
Comparing final polls to election results
I found the last polling results from the 2002 , 2003 , and 2006 elections , and could n’t resist studying them a bit better and comparing them to the eventual election outcome .
Two trends emerged : one that I more - or - less expected and one that was a complete surprise .
The expected trend was that the polls did an excellent job of capturing the primary theme of an election cycle , but that a secondary , less important but still quite unexpected , theme surfaced in the actual elections .
The surprising trend was that relative to the last polls , the right block as a whole won three seats ; two from the left and one from the christians .
This happened both in 2003 and 2006 , while in 2002 this last - minute shift was exactly twice as large .
Methodology
I took the results of the individual pollsters and entered them in my current poll app , which yielded the weighted average I use .
The tables below compare this weighted average to the election results .
2002
2002 was the year of the Fortuyn revolt and his tragic murder .
The last polls ( which I think were taken after his murder ) correctly predicted the size of the LPF and the deep , deep fall of the Purple parties .
These were the main themes of the 2002 cycle .
1998 2002 final polls 2002 elections CDA 29 +5 34 +9 43 LPF - +26 26 - 26 VVD 38 - 12 26 - 2 24 PvdA 45 - 21 24 - 1 23 GL 11 +2 13 - 3 10 SP 5 +3 8 +1 9 D66 14 -6 8 -1 7 CU 5 +1 6 - 2 4 SGP 3 - 1 2 - 2 LN - +3 3 - 1 2 Blocks Right 67 +22 89 +6 95 Left 75 - 22 53 - 4 49 Christian 8 - 8 - 2 6
What the polls did not predict was the size of the CDA victory .
Initially the CDA gains in the polls were moderate , but they surged up to an unexpected size of 43 seats in the elections .
This can be explained by the fear that was caused by Fortuyn ’s murder and the subsequent flight to the safe centre .
That was what brought the CDA back to power after the dark and dismal Purple years .
Note the dramatic loss of GL : this was caused by the fact that Fortuyn was murdered by an animal rights activist , a theme GL owned at that time .
GL party leader Rosenmüler was even threatened just before the elections , and GL ’s slight gain melted away to a slight loss .
2003
After the failure of Balkenende I ( CDA +VVD+LPF ) the major theme of the 2003 elections was the flight back from LPF to PvdA , and it pretty soon became a prime - minister race between Bos ( PvdA ) and Balkenende ( CDA ) .
2002 2003 final polls 2003 elections CDA 43 - 1 42 +2 44 PvdA 23 +20 43 - 1 42 VVD 24 +5 29 - 1 28 SP 9 +2 11 -2 9 GL 10 - 3 7 +1 8 LPF 26 - 20 6 +2 8 D66 7 - 1 6 - 6 CU 4 - 4 -1 3 SGP 2 - 2 - 2 LN 2 - 2 0 - 0 PvdD - - 0 - 0 Blocks Right 95 - 18 77 +3 80 Left 49 +18 67 - 2 65 Christian 6 - 6 -1 5
However , all polls from the last week or so pointed to a slight but clear PvdA advantage .
When the actual results came in ( and I remember my surprise ) the CDA turned out to have won slightly , and the PvdA lost slightly .
The reason for this last - minute change has general validity ; also for the current cycle .
A few voters who ’d planned to vote strategically for the PvdA in order to prevent the CDA from becoming the largest party decided to switch to their true preference when it seemed the PvdA remained in front of the CDA .
In other words , strategic voters may switch back to their true choice when it seems that their strategic vote is not necessary .
That could conceivably happen to the VVD in the current elections , although it ’s not easy to see where these votes would go to .
CDA ?
PVV ?
Or maybe even D66 ?
Besides , there ’s no neck - and - neck race between VVD and PvdA .
So on balance it ’s not very likely that the VVD will be crippled by the same effect .
2006
The 2006 elections are hard to characterise ; they did n’t have one outstanding theme like the previous two .
However , the most important political story was the dramatic rise of the SP , which combined protest voters with left - wing voters disappointed by the PvdA .
2003 2006 final polls 2006 elections CDA 44 - 3 41 - 41 PvdA 42 - 6 36 - 3 33 SP 9 +16 25 - 25 VVD 28 - 6 22 - 22 PVV - +5 5 +4 9 GL 8 - 1 7 - 7 CU 3 +4 7 -1 6 D66 6 - 4 2 +1 3 SGP 2 - 2 - 2 PvdD 0 +2 2 - 2 LPF 8 -8 0 - 0 EenNL - +1 1 - 1 0 Blocks Right 80 - 11 69 +3 72 Left 65 +5 70 - 2 68 Christian 5 +4 9 -1 8
Although it was clear that the extreme right would not disappear from parliament , it was widely held that the populist vote would be divided under three , maybe even four parties .
Two of them were eliminated even before the final polls , but until the last moment it seemed two parties would make the jump : Wilders ’s PVV and EenNL , which was mainly a vehicle for Rotterdam - based Fortuyn backers from the circles of Leefbaar Rotterdam , which is still the second party locally .
This turned out not to be the case : not only did EenNL narrowly miss its seat ( it lacked about 2,700 votes on a total of about 65,000 for a seat ) , but the PVV won not the expected five ( or six , with EenNL ’s one ) but nine .
Wilders ’s success can be explained by strategic voting : extreme right voters wanted to make as large an impact as possible , and therefore voters of the small three parties switched to Wilders .
But he still won more seats than expected even of the total extreme right ; and that ’s something that also happened to the LPF in 2003 , though not in 2002 .
Is this a new rule ?
Do extreme right voters tend to hide their vote from pollsters ?
If so Wilders might win more than the 17 seats the polls give him ( and the VVD would lose some ) .
Last - minute left -> right shift
What came as a total surprise to me was the last - minute shift to the right relative to the polls that took place in all three elections .
In the last years I read quite a few Dutch political science articles and I have n’t found a trace of a mention of any such effect , let alone an explanation .
( If I missed something , please leave a comment . )
What I did read recently ( ca n’t remember where ) is that turnout among right - wing voters is generally a little bit better than among left - wing voters .
The article linked this to left - wing voters generally being poorer , which could be true for all I know .
Still , I ’m afraid we have to accept this effect .
So I predict that the right will win three more seats relative to the last polls , while the left will lose two and the CU one .
Note : this is relative to the last polls , which will probably appear on the Monday or Tuesday before the elections .

Sixteen years on from the genocide , Rwanda is thriving and prosperous , beloved of donor nations but its president is accused of stifling dissent
Paul Kagame sits at the head of a vast polished oval table in his lush presidential compound in Kigali , an apparently fragile figure , rake - thin , his dark suit hanging loose .
The wire - framed glasses above jutting cheekbones give him an austerely academic look .
Rwanda 's president is a thoughtful man , who listens attentively and speaks slowly with an occasional almost self - deprecatory half - laugh , but the steel in the former general who brought genocide to an end 16 years ago is evident in his words .
" Democracy is good music but you need somebody with ears to listen to that music , " he says , leaning across the table .
" It does n't matter how much you talk about democracy or human rights .
Tell me about a family who spend the whole night looking at each other and wondering whether they will have something to eat .
Are they thinking about anything else ?
They are just not listening . "
We can all agree on the substance of democracy , he says , but the form it takes will be different even between European countries , the US and Japan .
" Your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me ? " he says .
Kagame has enjoyed the admiration of the west for establishing a peaceful , orderly and increasingly prosperous - looking Rwanda since the genocide of 1994 .
The country is now the darling of donor nations , with Kigali a striking contrast to the noisy , litter - strewn capitals of neighbouring African states .
Kagame 's model of development , he unhesitatingly says , is South Korea or Singapore .
Plastic bags are banned .
Dilapidated houses bear a large red cross , a warning that they must be renovated or face demolition within six months .
But to Kagame 's irritation , outsiders have begun to question the tight control he exercises over this model African state .
In recent months , two independent newspapers have been closed , and two generals have been arrested .
Most controversially , Victoire Ingabire , leader of the Hutu opposition United Democratic Forces party ( FDU ) , has been placed under house arrest following her return from the Netherlands .
Kagame , leader of the Tutsi - dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front , is being accused of suppressing dissent and subverting the democratic process ahead of the presidential elections in August .
But he argues that criticism from outside is unfair and ill - informed .
" Why should the outside world judge Rwanda , judge Kagame , based on the views of two or three people or papers and not based on the views of Rwandans ?
If you ask people how they feel about government and the leadership , they give an entirely different view from what outsiders think , " he says .
Kagame 's view is that the media high council had to act against the newspapers , which were libellous , irresponsible and inciting ethnic violence , and his government had to move against the generals , one of whom was accused of corruption and the other of immorality .
Ingabire , he claims , has links to rebel Hutus .
The timing of events was coincidental ; his government could not delay taking action just because the presidential election was imminent .
" The west has democracy because it has institutions that hold people accountable .
What has killed Rwanda and Africa is that people are not held accountable , " he says .
" So the question is , how do you want us to live ?
By allowing ministers or generals or mayors to run the show without accountability ?
Is that the form of democracy you want for us ?
We are saying no . "
Years on from the genocide of the minority dominant Tutsis and moderate Hutus , initiated by Hutu militia and politicians , no one believes that the two groups now live in universal harmony – even though ethnic identity is suppressed with an end to identity cards showing a person 's group , and children competing in school exams under a number , not a name .
But Kagame 's priority is food on the table .
He hopes the next generation will be too busy making money to fight .
Change is embraced .
Things get done .
The agriculture minister , a woman , is driving through potentially unpopular reforms of land use , persuading farmers to concentrate on the crops that grow best in their region against the tradition of subsistence farming .
Landlocked Rwanda is in discussions with its neighbours about lowering tariff barriers and forming an east African union .
There are incentives for businesses to start up .
And Kagame is rare among African leaders in his condemnation of dependence on foreign aid , which , he says , risks " depriving people of their dignity and not pushing them to work and uplift themselves , because that is what makes it sustainable " .
He says : " I refuse to belong to the side that would accept to perpetuate that dependency on others " .
He puts a shot across the donors ' bows .
" If it were entirely altruistic , why would the west be more interested in giving aid than in opening up for fair trade ? "
Just a couple of miles away , Ingabire sits in state in a half - furnished bungalow .
The houses , leafy gardens and wide , paved , streets of the 2020 Vision estate all look the same , but it 's impossible to mistake her house .
On the pavement facing the high locked gate sits an armed guard on a wooden chair .
Another is half - hidden by a hedge , talking on a mobile phone .
Ingabire cannot leave her house .
She came back to stand against Kagame in the August election , but can not get past the first hurdle .
In order to register her party she must hold a rally of at least 200 supporters .
She says she has come to champion democracy because Kagame 's ruling party has failed to do so .
" Sixteen years after the genocide we think it is time to move to the democratic system , " she says .
" You ca n't say because of the genocide that people can't be free .
I do n't agree with this . "
It is put to her that most people outside Rwanda think the country has made great progress in the past 16 years .
" The problem with Kagame is that he says we have stability and development and we do n't need more , " she says .
" My answer is that the stability we have in Rwanda is stability based on pressure .
We have development in the hands of a little group . "
Outside of the Kigali region , she says , poverty is unchanged .
Kagame insists that there is " concrete evidence " that Ingabire supported and helped finance the Hutu rebels of the Democratic Liberation Front ( FDLR ) in the Congo .
His foreign minister , the formidable and highly articulate Louise Mushikiwabo , who spent 20 years in the US and is married to an American , thinks Ingabire 's arrival is a threat to the hard - won truce between Tutsi and Hutu .
She characterises Ingabire 's challenge as " very deliberate , controversial ethnic politics , this woman really has a genocidal ideology " .
Ingabire threw down the gauntlet on the day of her arrival , maintains Mushikiwabo .
She went straight to the genocide memorial museum in Kigali , looked around and questioned why it did not commemorate the deaths of any Hutus who died in the violence .
" That in Rwanda is revisionism , " she says .
" We know that there were Hutus killed in the context of the genocide , but they were n't targeted .
The more you blur the lines , the more you think it was a free - for - all .
To us it is so clear cut .
The dynamics are not understood abroad .
It is maybe because things look too normal in this country .
But when you allow people to go out into the villages and start that sort of rhetoric , you are really walking into trouble . "
The opposition leader rejects the allegations made against her of support and funding for rebel Hutus in the Congo .
She admits she went to Kinshasa twice , but not at the times alleged by the government .
" They say I was in Kinshasa and met members of the FDLR in March and September 2008 .
I was not there in March but in February , not in September but October .
I can prove it with my passport . "
She went to ask the Congolese government for support for her political party , she says , just as she has visited many countries looking for backing .
Ingabire does not dispute the genocide of 1994 , but her concern is clearly with what she thinks is the airbrushing of violence against Hutus .
" Before the genocide and after the genocide there was killing against the Hutu and against the Tutsis .
Now the government of Kagame authorises only to talk about genocide against the Tutsis .
They do n't accept that we talk about the crime against humanity committed before the genocide .
That is the big problem we have .
If we need to reconcile the Rwandan people we have to talk also about this killing before and after the genocide . "
She claims that the apparent reconciliation of Tutsi and Hutu is only surface deep .
" They say do n't talk about Hutu or Tutsi , but we know that the problem we had in our country is based on the differences between the two groups .
The thing we can do is to take our courage and talk about the problem .
You can't say , do n't talk about the problem and in time people will forget it .
It is not true . "
She dismissed the hearings of the traditional gacaca courts , set up all over Rwanda to try cases against thousands of those involved in genocide , alleging that the RPF took control and that people did not dare speak their minds .
" It is not a place where the victims meet the killers to talk about what happened . "
Is it possible that violence could return ?
" Yes , of course , " she says .
Ingabire , whose husband and three children are still in the Netherlands , says she is back in Rwanda to stay .
" I still believe that we will participate in the election , but if they go ahead and do everything to stop us , we will still be a political party , " she says .
" I will stay here .
Even if they put me in jail , I will stay here .
One day I believe we will achieve what we want . "
About 45 minutes ' drive from Kigali there is a church where the sun shines through bullet holes in the wooden roof on to thousands of pieces of soiled and rotting clothing on the wooden benches below .
They – and the shelves of skulls and arm and leg bones in an underground crypt – are all that remain of some 10,000 massacred Tutsis .
You can still distinguish children 's dresses and women 's skirts here .
Machetes and knives lie on the bloodsoaked altar cloth .
A young woman tells you calmly that the weapons were used to rip the unborn baby out of the womb of a Hutu woman who refused to kill her Tutsi husband .
As you walk away , shaken , the question of democracy takes on a new relevance .
Just 16 years on , is Rwanda ready ?
' Deterrent Lite ' A Look at Britain 's and France 's Nuclear Arsenals

Nearly a month ago amateur footage was released ostensibly showing a Russian clean - up crew at the crash site killing off the few survivors of the Polish presidential plane crash .
It seems unlikely that a crew would be waiting there on - site in that location as it’s an otherwise unremarkable wood that would not be frequented by the Russian authorities .
Unless they were waiting for someone , that is .
This air crash had some telltale signs of being a pre-planned accident .
On - site footage has sparked Polish demand for an international investigation better than the whitewashing collusion of Putin ’s and Prime Minister Donald Tusk ’s Polish underlings .
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said “ there is something incredibly evil ” in the death of Polish President Lech Kaczynski and his entourage .
Compelling new evidence suggesting that the plane crash killing President Lech Kaczynski , nearly a hundred top military brass and civilians leaders was engineered is generating growing criticism of the Prime Minister , forcing him to deal with this reality .
And this is not the first time a Polish head of state has died mysteriously in an air crash .
Recently , cleaned - up footage of the video has been spread in part through a collaborative Facebook effort to further showcase the events of that fateful day in April .
This includes a better English transcription than originally posted due to more precise audio analysis .
By no small coincidence the day of the crash was the seventieth anniversary of the first Katyn Massacre where Nazi Germany allowed Russians to kill 22,000 Polish officials , intellectuals , landowners and leading people of Polish communities .
The digitally enhanced video below shows people in confrontation in the aftermath of the plane crash , now the second Katyn massacre .
Notice there is only smoke , not fog , in contrast to initial mainstream media reports .

1:20 Let ’s get out of here .
We should remember to keep in mind that the nefarious globalists who orchestrated previous assassinations and terrorist attacks historically worldwide have a penchant for using special dates like 9/11 and 7/7 .
Their obsession with numerology and symbolism shows this “ accident ” to be no accident at all , indeed containing the textbook hallmarks of planned regime change as observed throughout history .
Much disinformation has been released in the media about what actually occurred on April 10th .
To clear the air on a few issues :
Initial reports said that the plane attempted to land several times due to dense fog , but later it was revealed by a senior Russian aviation official that it only attempted to land once , and that it crashed on that attempt .
There was no fog in the area as was suggested .
The amateur video footage and weather reports contradict this media claim of fog obscuring the pilot ’s view .
Fog usually requires 100 % humidity ( unless created artificially ) , and as can be seen from the weather report below , it was only at 60 % .
In fact , there was no fog for the entire week in that area .
This information is confirmed in weather reports .
The media also says the TU - 154 has a questionable safety record , and that the presidential plane was more than two decades old .
But sources reveal the plane had just been serviced :
“ The Polish presidential plane was fully overhauled in December , its three engines repaired and updated with retrofitted electronic and navigation equipment . ”
A thorough check is standard routine before a flight .
Planes are statistically one of the safest means of travel in the world .
Hardly any head of state has died in a plane crash in the past few decades .
Now half the Polish government is dead !
How likely is it that this was an accident ?
Let ’s look at another analysis :
“ Commentator James Buchanan ( link to article follows ) makes some observations about fortuitous plane accidents , including one that killed the Polish prime minister ( in exile ) after he learned the real story of Katyn in 1943 .
It ’s not that hard to arrange a plane accident , as at least three former members of the Kennedy family – including Joe Kennedy , Jr. and John Kennedy , Jr. – could testify !
“ Buchanan points out that the Polish presidential plane had a complete overhaul in 2009 and the model of Tupelov that had been involved in accidents was sound and that the cited accidents took place in remote areas where maintenance was not so good . ”
Contrary to some reports of mechanical failure , the plane was in perfect condition , recently inspected and refurbished with new navigational and electronic equipment .
The plane was equipped with TAWS ( Terrain Awareness System ) in addition to standard radar , so there is hardly likely it would clip a tree on the way down as the navigational alarm would have sounded .
No alarms were reported from the black boxes .
Unless the upgraded electronic equipment had been modified or sabotaged , or even affected by a Russian electro - magnetic pulse weapon , as some suggest .
In that case , manual override may have been necessary , or even impossible if the wiring had been severely affected .
If a manual landing was attempted , it may have been unsuccessful due to the fact that lamps were turned off on the runway , and additional beacons were misplaced to lure the pilot into the woods .
Literally , false light bulbs were put in the lamps and were then later removed after the crash .
According to the report above , when questioned , reporters were told to “ go away . ”
So it appears that the pilot was given false information about the location of the runway .
This could have been not only visual but also electronic , if the plane ’s navigational system had been sabotaged to give incorrect data .
One of the bigger problems with the investigation is that much of it was done through the Russian authorities , and then information was handed off to the Polish people , instead of releasing the electronic devices themselves .
Neither the black boxes nor audio recordings have been released to the Polish government , but only transcripts .
If the Russian government had any involvement in this assassination , this would be something that they would want to do to hide their interference .
Too much information from this investigation has been heavily controlled and concealed .
Things are always actively hidden for a purpose .
As it is said , “ For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come toward the light , so that his works might not be exposed . ”
Regular investigative procedures clearly were n’t being followed , and it is clear that lies have been planted at every step along the way to obfuscate the truth .
Certain news outlets suggested that the pilot was not able to speak Russian and there was confusion during the landing .
Colleagues of the pilot say he was fluent in Russian , contrary to media reports .
Early speculative reports suggested that the president or another commanding officer who outranked the pilot told the pilot to act against his wishes .
Transcripts from black box , however , show that no upper commander was interfering with the pilot .
Continuing on the topic of malfeasance , the base radar at the military airport which the presidential plane was to land in was disabled after Tusk met with Putin a week before the crash , at a more important meeting which the President and other Polish politicians were suspiciously not invited to .
Supposedly , the bodies were taken to Moscow and eventually all accounted for , but this goes in direct contradiction to pilot voice logs that states that only four people had been on board .
Likely the stated passengers had been abducted and diverted to some other location , as suggested by Gerhard Wisnewski , where they would be disposed of against their will and / or knowledge .
This procedure probably occurred on 9/11 as well , due to the fact that no bodies were ever retrieved – no dental records , nothing from any of the flights .
For a plane crashing from perhaps less than 10 meters above the ground , according to flight analysis by pilots and aviation experts , casualties would be quite low , hence the likelihood of finding survivors and the need for them to be “ disappeared ” by those who seemingly wished to displace them .
If the plane was flying on low fuel and just meters above the ground as reported , how is it possible that the pieces of the plane were found two kilometers away ?
How could it have hit the tops of trees at 20 and 25 meters when it was still going without any collision at ten meters ?
Also , onlookers reported an explosion … but from what , if the fuel was nearly empty ?
Conflicting information reports whether all the bodies from this crash were retrieved , and whether they were even identifiable .
Polish and Russian officials said nobody survived the crash .
But the amateur footage reveals otherwise , including footage of what appears to be the pilot in standard garb , climbing out of the wreckage and waving !
All the bodies have been found , they allege – and yet at the same time , authorities say DNA tests will have to be carried out on the bones of many to identify them .
Whoa , wait a minute – should n’t that be done beforehand , if they were already supposedly “ identified ? ”
And that is just one example .
What about the erased computers of crash victims three hours afterwards by the Polish secret service ?
How about the fact that the Prime Minister has complete say over any conclusion the investigation will ever come to ?
Both these questions and more have been posited by Kavkaz Center and remain unanswered .
Clearly there is definite malfeasance going on here .
The question of motive has been previously addressed , but should be reviewed :
Poland was the only country in the EU that refused to strengthen its currency , as its Zloty being weak was a benefit to the Polish economy in exports , employment and tax revenues .
The national bank governor had said he would not take loans from the IMF … they had even been so bold as to offer to loan the IMF money !
But after the governor ’s untimely death the IMF loans have started against his plans .
Poland is the only country that is not in recession in Europe , it ’s actually grown 2.75 % this year , and 1.7 % last year , and growth projections are even higher for next year .
Its debt is quite low compared to other countries at around 50 % of its GDP .
We can expect Poland to be absorbed into the Eurozone and increasing the size of its debts as its Central Bank governor was taken in the crash .
North Dakota is the only of the 50 US states to grow , and they have a state bank .
As the state of North Dakota illustrates , economies can grow in spite of a general decline surrounding it , and Poland is another shining example of growth against the surrounding trends .
Poland ’s economy is indeed no joke .
After a licensed Novartis bird flu vaccine killed 21 homeless people in Poland in the summer of 2008 , Poland refused the Swine flu vaccination , and was the only country in Europe to do so .
Poland and Italy were the only two countries in the EU to threaten to veto EU climate change plans .
Two weeks before the horrible plane crash involving the Polish Government and its finance head , the IMF visited Poland .
They remarked that Poland was the only prosperous country in the EU , and also the last member signing into the European Union .
They were wanting the Polish government to embrace the Euro as the sole unit of money , even though the polish Zloty has grown in value against the sinking Euro .
And now a nation ’s military heads and government have been deposed at one fell swoop .
Some good insight and questions that have been asked by investigative journalist Jane Burgermeister , from which I have referenced heavily from in this article , follow :
“ How come President Kaczynski and half of Poland ’s government flew to Katyn three days after the official anniversary ?
Why did 100 figures who are vital for the day - to - day functioning of the Polish government go to a relatively insignificant ceremony , and not to the main one ?
What reason could there be for the Polish central bank governor to fly to Katyn to attend the ceremony ?
Why did the 100 top Polish leaders all fly on the same plane ?
How could security protocols that require that even a president and his deputy fly separately be so relaxed that so many key people needed to run the Polish government from day to day are allowed to fly on the same plane ?
And in a Russian Tupolev plane , and to the traditional arch - enemy of Poland , Russia ?
Why were none of the journalists that accompany the president on the plane as usual ?
According to Polish media , journalists were told that they had been assigned to another plane that had had technical problems and they would , therefore , need to switch to a third plane , delaying their arrival in Katyn .
The delay of the journalists in arriving at the scene of the crash allowed a better manipulation of the media coverage .
According to both Bild am Sonntag and the Berliner Zeitung newspapers , a hotel close to the crash site was sealed off , possibly to ensure that journalists who might have seen the crash could not send photos or reports .
A man who took pictures of the crash site using his mobile phone had to erase the photos at a police check point on his way home .
What evidence is there that these people were on the plane to Smolensk at all apart from the passenger list issued by the authorities ?
It is conceivable that the 100 top Polish leaders were rounded up in a purge and killed or kidnapped inside Poland and that the airplane accident in Russia was staged to explain their deaths .
Weather reports indicated clouds but not fog .
According to the official version , however , the plane hit trees as it approached Smolensk airport in thick fog , and caught fire .
The plane made four landing attempts because of the fog , according to the mainstream media .
But another witness reported hearing an explosion .
The damage of the plane shown is consistent with an explosion .
Debris was scattered around an area more than one kilometer .
Pilot error was a possible reason for the crash , according to the official story .
But the pilots chosen to fly heads of state are highly qualified .
Why was the plane flying so low that it “ hit a tree ? ”
Were n’t the instruments measuring altitude on board working ?
What was the co-pilot doing ?
Where was the military escort ?
The security service detail ? ”
More analysis from this investigative journalist can be found here .
Not to mention that the bishop of Poland ’s Protestant Church was killed in a car accident returning home from funeral ceremonies for President Lech Kaczynski .
Whether this is an untimely coincidence or not is unknown , but the fact remains that a lot of people have died on route to commemorate the Polish dead .
It ’s definitely reminiscent of Princess Diana , to say the least .
Conspiracies do exist .
Recently congress has admitted Lee Harvey Oswald did n’t act alone in the JFK assassination .
All a conspiracy is is when two people or more act together to plan to commit criminal acts .
We see that more and more every day in the financial sector , by our political leaders , through price - setting oligopolistic global corporations , and on even an international level .
In this case , the EU , with the cooperation of Russia , is the implicated party .
We know that Putin is buddy - buddy with the oligarchs running Eastern and Western Europe .
Why should we think the EU is infallible when Europe has had such a long history of criminal conspiracy , with kings and dukes being assassinated at every turn of the page ?
From the Catiline conspiracies in first century BC , to the killing of Julius Caesar , from the Pazzi conspiracy , to the Babington Plot and the Throckmorton Plot , from the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 , to the Dreyfus Affair , to Operation Himmler – these are all European conspiracies , not even divulging the modern - day ones .
Who says conspiracies are only theory ?
It ’s not just theory , it ’s a fact of reality : corporations and individuals are being arraigned on conspiracy charges on a daily basis now , and people do hard time in prison for the crime of conspiring to commit crimes .
Cui Bono : Who Stands To Gain ?
Prime Minister
Tusk is an EU - friendly politician in contrast to the leaders who died in the plane crash , and appears to be talented at doublespeak – much like Obama , showing support for policies that the public supports , in contrast to what he actually stands for and represents .
Before the crash , Polish politicians were becoming more nationalistic and preferred Polish self - determination over international government and corporate cooperation .
Tusk ’s party is predicted to win the next presidential election .
The only two other presidential candidates died in the crash , publicly accepted and popular but now cast aside due to tragedy .
The date of the presidential election has been moved up from October to June , giving Tusk ’s party the advantage .
His party ’s victory will cement the dominance of the European Union over Poland , and quite conveniently just in time for Goldman Sachs , Citigroup and Morgan Stanley to move in to dominate and corrupt their financial system .
The European Union stands to gain the most .
Certainly , Russia does n’t benefit from this affair , except perhaps in the form of military dominance .
But those aggressions have long since past , and Poland is not a big threat to Russia .
The EU wants Poland to step into line with their program , so that they can go on to the next stage of global governance .
With the last piece of their puzzle being put into place , the EU is now being fully united in a corporate body .
What is the message that this oddly - timed regime change has brought to the people of the free world , countries and leaders who wish to resist the globalist empire ?
Oppose us and die !
Greece , Italy , Ireland and other states within the EU have shown their desire to stand apart from complete EU governance and the domination of the Euro , and now Poland has been made an example of .
Dare oppose the IMF , the Eurozone , EU - mandated vaccinations and the global powers - that - be , and you will be dealt with most severely .

Comment on this article
Archbishop Reinhard Marx backed the creation of a sex - abuse task force Pope Benedict XVI 's former diocese in Germany is facing daily allegations of physical and sexual abuse , the head of its new sex - abuse task force says .
" It is like a tsunami , " Elke Huemmeler told the Associated Press news agency .
She said about 120 cases had come to light so far in Munich , about 100 of them at a boarding school run by monks .
The Roman Catholic Church has been rocked by scandals involving priests in Germany , Switzerland , Ireland , Austria and the Netherlands in recent months .
Pope Benedict has written a pastoral letter to the Catholics of Ireland , to be read at Sunday Mass , with guidelines on preventing and punishing sexual abuse of children by priests .
It is unknown if the letter includes an apology .
I have never seen a graver crisis affecting the very credibility of the leadership of the world 's longest surviving international organisation , the Roman Catholic Church
Willey : Vatican ends ' wall of silence '
The Pope has said he hopes the letter will " help in the process of repentance , healing and renewal " .
The BBC's David Willey in Rome says that a taboo that has endured for decades has been broken and the Vatican is now taking a much harder line than in the past .
It is recommending a zero - tolerance attitude , adopted by American bishops after widespread cases of sexual abuse of children by priests in the US .
As this will be the first public document published by the Vatican on this potentially explosive subject , there is worldwide interest in what the Pope is going to say , our correspondent says .
The guidelines he will announce will be valid for other countries as well as Ireland .
' Shocked '
Ms Huemmeler spoke to AP as her newly - appointed Task Force on Sexual Abuse Prevention began work in the Munich diocese , backed by Archbishop Reinhard Marx .
Ms Huemmeler said she and colleagues had been " shocked " when the first revelations of abuse cases at the Ettal monastery boarding school , run by Benedictine monks , emerged .
ABUSE SCANDALS THIS YEAR Germany : About 300 cases of alleged abuse reported Netherlands : Bishops order probe into more than 200 alleged cases Switzerland : Probe finds 60 alleged victims over past 15 years , Swiss media report Austria : Five priests suspended from same monastery
Catholic Church sex abuse scandals Vatican defends Pope Benedict
What next for scandal - hit Church ?
Reaction from around the web
The diocese has not confirmed details of all the allegations , saying investigations are ongoing , the AP reports .
The Vatican recently denounced attempts to link the Pope to a child sex scandal in his former diocese .
The episode dates back to 1980 , when he was archbishop of Munich and Freising , and known as Joseph Ratzinger .
The diocese said he had once unwittingly approved housing for a priest accused of child abuse .
However , a former deputy said he - not the future Pope - had made the decision to re-house the priest , who later abused other children and was convicted .
Last year , a damning report into child abuse in the Dublin archdiocese criticised the Catholic Church hierarchy for covering up hundreds of cases going back to the early 1970s .
Until recently , the Vatican has been on the defensive , our correspondent says , protective of priests rather than their victims , and arguing that ecclesiastical courts should decide on suitable punishment for errant clergy .
But victims of clerical sexual abuse argue that they want a full - scale apology from the Pope , in addition to compensation .
They also say bishops should always notify the local police first , not the Vatican , when cases of sexual abuse by clergy are reported to them .

For those of us trying to increase scientific literacy – understanding of the methods , philosophical underpinnings , common pitfalls , and current findings of science – it can be a frustrating endeavor .
Sometimes it seems we are caught in a Catch - 22 : some people do n’t care about science because they do n’t understand it , and they do n’t want to learn about science because they do n’t care .
Even worse , at times ( most times ) we seem to be coming up against emotions and patterns of thought deeply rooted in evolution that nothing short of transcendence will solve .
Three recent studies reinforce our worst fears about human nature and make it clear how much of an uphill battle we face .
The first looks at attitudes toward the MMR vaccine and which sources parents trust the most .
The researchers found :
Five key themes emerged .
Parents felt they did n’t have enough information , especially in relation to the dangers associated with not vaccinating .
Government sources were not trusted .
By contrast , other parents were trusted : ‘ Parents trust advice from other parents , ’ one mother said .
‘[ You ] take it on board .
You listen to them . ’
Parents also revealed they were biased towards risk - related information .
And they misunderstood balance , believing that pro- and anti-MMR arguments should be given equal weight even though the scientific evidence overwhelming favours MMR vaccination .
Part of this seems solvable , but part is inherent .
The solvable parts include parents not having enough information regarding the dangers of not vaccinating .
Lack of information is always the easiest problem to solve – make the information more readily available , especially to people when and where they are making decisions that will be informed by that information .
The other two elements are due to evolved human nature , and therefore are tough nuts to crack .
Parents rely on information from other parents – more generally , people find stories much more compelling than data .
It makes sense that our natural instincts would be inclined toward stories from our peers .
It also makes sense that we would tend to believe and remember such stories , that they would be emotionally profound .
In our evolutionary milieu , there was probably more to lose from being doubtful or forgetful of cautionary tales told to us by our peers , than from heeding them .
In our complex modern society with phishing scams , used car salesmen , and urban legends , being gullible is probably more of a detriment than being skeptical , but even still we find ourselves riveted by a ripping yarn , especially one of harm that could have been avoided .
Therefore , it should be no surprise that there are numerous grassroots parent groups forming that are basically built on parents or patients educating each other .
Such groups come in all flavors – some are guided by a strong dedication to the science , others mix science with anecdote and myth without discrimination , and still others wonder off into a fantasy land of pseudoscience and conspiracy .
They each develop their own subculture , mainly driven by person to person communication .
Further , the study shows that people are more compelled by fear than reassurance .
Medical decisions are best informed by a careful assessment of risk vs benefit – but emotionally we are much more compelled by the prospect of risk than the prospect of benefit .
( Actually , this relationship is more complex and depends on context .
People will accept great risk if the potential benefit is huge , like a cure for a terminal or serious illness .
If the benefit is more abstract , like preventing a problem they do not currently have , then they focus on risk . )
Here again , we are much more likely to be compelled by one story of a side effect , than all the statistics about preventing illness .
The difference in our emotional response to statistics vs our emotional response to dramatic stories largely explains why some people are afraid to fly , and why others fear vaccination .
The other two components of this research – lack of trust in government and favoring balance ( even when the information is not balanced ) may be more cultural than hard - wired .
Either way , they are further barriers to educating the public about vaccines .
The second study is , in some ways , even more disturbing than the first , because it strikes right at the heart of skeptical activism .
Researchers find that when people are confronted with scientific information that directly challenges a cherished belief , their typical response is to argue for the impotence of science – science is unable to prove or disprove my belief .
That much is predictable , and any skeptic can tell you that this is a common response .
However , the study takes it one step further – they found that people also , after being confronted , shift their belief toward thinking that science in general is impotent .
This probably is a mechanism to reduce cognitive dissonance , but in any case confronting people with disconfirming scientific evidence tends to reduce their confidence in science in general .
We have seen this in action with the anti-evolutionists .
They not only reject the science of evolution , in their defense of their religious beliefs they often reject science as a methodology .
The Discovery Institute has certainly done this , arguing that the materialistic paradigm of science ( i.e. science ) is crumbling ( i.e. impotent ) .
Once you distrust science it is easy to reject any scientific position you do n’t like , so the DiscoTute has happily also chucked out modern neuroscience and climatology as well – it ’s all an atheistic , materialistic , liberal conspiracy .
It ’s the snowball effect of anti-science .
This study just confirms that .
The third study is in line with the previous two , but looks at belief in ESP .
Essentially they told several groups that ESP was either supported by 10 % of the public vs 90 % of the public or that it was either supported by or rejected by the scientific community .
Every permutation of these two variables was tested .
The results – people were more likely to regard ESP favorably if they were told that the majority of the public believed in it – we are compelled by the beliefs of our peers .
We want to fit in .
This is not surprise .
Disturbing , however , was the fact that people in this study were more likely to accept ESP if they were told scientists rejected it rather than accepted it .
They took the opposite opinion of the scientific community .
What process is at work here ?
Are they reflexively rejecting authority ?
Do they assume that scientists are closed - minded about the paranormal if they reject it , but if they accept it does that trigger some natural skepticism ?
Regardless of the explanation , it seems that the natural instinct is the opposite of what it should be .
Conclusion
It ’s easy to become depressed by this trifecta of studies , but they really do n’t paint a picture different than what we already knew – people believe stories over science and come to their conclusions mostly for evolved emotional , rather than dry rational , reasons .
These studies are helpful because they illuminate the details and hopefully will provide some guidance as we continue to search for strategies to promote science and reason .

But in ourselves , that we are underlings . " --

" Just because I do n't care does n't mean I do n't understand . " -- Homer Simpson
Our text today is from Tom Englehardt , who is on the case with yet another ignored atrocity by our super - duper Special Ops boys in the goodest good war of them all out in Afghanistan .
( See the original for the many links ) :
" Afghan lawmaker says relative killed after U.S. soldiers raided her home . " ...
[ H ] ere it is in a nutshell : there was a U.S. night raid somewhere near the Afghan city of Jalalabad .
American forces ( Special Operations forces , undoubtedly ) , supposedly searching for a " Taliban facilitator , " came across a man they claimed was armed in a country in which the unarmed man is evidently like the proverbial needle in a haystack .
They shot him down .
His name was Amanullah .
He was a 30 - year - old auto mechanic and the father of five .
As it happened , he was also the brother - in - law of Safia Siddiqi , a sitting member of the Afghan Parliament .
He had , as she explained , called her in a panic , thinking that brigands were attacking his home compound .
And here was the nice touch for those U.S. Special Operations guys , who seem to have learning abilities somewhat lower than those of a hungry mouse in a maze when it comes to hearts - and - minds - style counterinsurgency warfare .
True , in this case they did n’t shoot two pregnant mothers and a teenage girl , dig the bullets out of the bodies , and claim they had stumbled across " honor killings , " as Special Operations troops did in a village near Gardez in eastern Afghanistan in March ; nor did they handcuff seven schoolboys and a shepherd and execute them , as evidently happened in Kunar Province in late December 2009 ; nor had they shot a popular imam in his car with his seven - year - old son in the backseat , as a passing NATO convoy did in Kabul , the Afghan capital , back in January ; nor had they shadowed a three - vehicle convoy by helicopter on a road near the city of Kandahar and killed 21 while wounding 13 via rocket fire , as U.S. Special Forces troops did in February .
They did n’t wipe out a wedding party – a common enough occurrence in our Afghan War — or a funeral , or a baby - naming ceremony ( as they did in Paktia Province , also in February ) , or shoot up any one of a number of cars , trucks , and buses loaded with innocent civilians at a checkpoint .
In this case , they killed only one man , who was unfortunately — from their point of view — reasonably well connected .
Then , having shot him , they reportedly forced the 15 inhabitants in his family compound out , handcuffed and blindfolded them ( including the women and children ) , and here was that nice touch : they sent in the dogs , animals considered unclean in Islamic society , undoubtedly to sniff out explosives .
Brilliant !
" They disgraced our pride and our religion by letting their dogs sniff the holy Koran , our food , and the kitchen , " Ms. Siddiqi said angrily .
And then , the American military began to lie about what had happened , which is par for the course .
After the angry legislator let them have it ( " … no one in Afghanistan is safe — not even parliamentarians and the president himself " ) and the locals began to protest , blocking the main road out of Jalalabad and chanting " Death to America ! , " they finally launched an investigation .
Yawn .
If I had a few bucks for every " investigation " the U.S. military launched in Iraq and Afghanistan over the years after some civilian or set of civilians died under questionable circumstances , I might be on vacation year around .
The U.S. military can , however , count on one crucial factor in its repetitive war - making : kill some pregnant mothers , kill some schoolboys , gun down a good Samaritan with two children in his car trying to transport Iraqis wounded in an Apache helicopter attack to a hospital , loose a whirlwind that results in hundreds of thousands of deaths — and still Americans at home largely do n’t care .
After all , for all intents and purposes , it ’s as if some other country were doing this on another planet entirely , and " for our safety " at that .
In that sense , the American public licenses its soldiers to kill civilians repetitively in distant frontier wars .
As a people — with the exception of relatively small numbers of Americans directly connected to the hundreds of thousands of American troops abroad — we could n’t be more detached from " our " wars .
This is a theme , a reality , that is emerging more clearly as the years of the never - ending Terror War drag on : by and large , the American people do not care about the innocent people being killed , in their names , all over the world .
They do n't care about " the children ’s limbs hanging in trees , " as war 's eyewitness John Pilger puts it .
They do n't care -- even as the inevitable , predictable blowback from these murderous polices comes home to roost on their own streets , the icy voice of revenge that says : " You come to our countries and kill our people ; we will come to your country and kill yours . "
The former is considered a high and noble calling ; the latter an act of unspeakable evil .
That violence is not the answer -- that it only perpetuates the endless cycle of murder and vengeance that has marked our humankind since our mutation out of apehood -- is of no moment to those who see their loved ones shredded to death unjustly before their eyes .
What would I do if I came home from an ordinary day at work to find my children -- my children -- dead beneath the ruins of my drone - struck house ?
What would I do if saw my ailing father muscled from his home by masked goons who beat him and humiliate him then drag him off , bleeding , dying , to some iron - fronted dungeon ?
I hope I would have the strength to hold onto my belief in non-violence as the only hope to one day evolve our natures , and our cultures , beyond their deep - dyed savagery .
But how likely is it that I would be that extraordinary , that I would have the extra measure of wisdom to know that more death and destruction would not bring back my loved ones , but only keep the cycle going to devour more innocents ?
How likely is it that I would have the moral courage to fight off the " cloud of blood and hormones " that drives the craving for revenge ?
Not too likely , I fear ; not in my case , nor in that of most others .
Yet every day -- day in , day out , week after week , month after month , year after year -- atrocities like those described above are being carried out , in the name of the American people , in the name of civilization , in the name of our " way of life . "
Every day , day after day , some father or mother finds their children 's limbs hanging in the trees , some child finds his parent 's broken bodies smoking in the rubble , some ordinary , innocent human being sees their loved ones beaten , chained , abused and killed .
Every day , day after day .
Only a fool -- a bloody - minded , arrogant , puffed - up , pig - ignorant fool -- could not see the horrific harvest of hate and destruction that will spring from such evil seeds .
Only a fool -- or an elitist so wadded in wealth and privilege that he believes these monstrous fruits will never touch him personally , and does n't care what happens to the rabble below , as long as his profits -- and his primitive , psychosexual lust for forcible dominion -- remain safe .
We are ruled today by just such fools , together with just such cold , deadened , malevolent spirits .
But we seem to be content with this .
Indeed , the most vociferous , active dissent we see these days comes from those who feel the system is not cruel enough -- who rage at the very thought that tax money might be spent to help someone in need , or that the borders have not yet been laced with radioactive razor - wire , or that accused criminals still have their rights read to them , or that Iran has not been destroyed , or that the power of Big Money might in any way be hedged with light restrictions .
These things bring thousands out in anger : but murder , aggression , torture , atrocity , and corruption on a scale unseen and hitherto unimaginable in human history -- these leave them cold ... as cold as the malevolent spirits who with their useful fools accelerate our degradation .

Radically Democratic Extremism : An Interview with Joel Olson
A while back , I heard that Joel was doing research on “ fanaticism ” and “ extremism . ”
Knowing his work , this sounded pretty exciting to me …a project likely produce some interesting and useful political / strategic angles .
Then , a fellow AK collective member sent me a web link to a talk Joel gave on the subject at the Phoenix Class War Council ’s “ Beer and Revolution ” series .
Almost a year later , I finally sat down with a beer of my own to listen .
Like the fanatics and zealots he studies , Joel manages , in a little over an hour , to uncompromisingly reconfigure the map of political possibilities available to revolutionaries today .
You , too , can listen .
I ’ve pasted the multi-part audio link at the end of this post .
Between here and there , you ’ll find an interview I did with Joel after I heard the talk .
Read / listen on …

AK : How did you first become interested in studying , fanaticism , extremism , and zealotry ?
JO : In 2001 , I was writing the last chapter for my first book , The Abolition of White Democracy , on what a world without whiteness might look like .
I was reading up on the original abolitionist movement , particularly its main philosopher , Wendell Phillips ( in The Lesson of the Hour , edited by Noel Ignatiev ) .
I was intrigued by how Phillips openly embraced the label “ fanatic ” that anti-abolitionists threw at him .
Then 9/11 happened , and I was struck by the contrast : on the one hand every media outlet was discussing the problem of “ extremism ” and “ fanaticism ” and what to do about it , while on the other hand I ’m reading about this radical abolitionist who embraced the term , and even outlined a theory of fanatical politics .
I got to thinking that maybe Phillips was right ; maybe extremism is useful for those of us seeking a free society , and not just those seeking religious tyranny .
( By the way , I consider the terms extremism , fanaticism , and zealotry to be functionally equivalent , and use them interchangeably . )
AK : One of the things I liked best about your talk was how methodically you differentiate between mainstream ( i.e. pejorative ) definitions of “ fanaticism ” and the way you use the term .
Could you break that distinction down for us ?
For most of its critics throughout Western history , fanaticism is an ideology of irrationality , intolerance , fundamentalism , and terrorism .
Certainly many fanatics are irrational , intolerant , fundamentalist , undemocratic , and / or terrorists .
But Wendell Phillips and his comrades were none of these things .
They were fanatically opposed to slavery , but they were also radical democrats who opposed racial oppression , supported women ’s rights , defended free speech , and believed in liberty and equality for all .
The pejorative notion of extremism clouds our ability to understand radically democratic extremism .
From this , I came to conclude that extremism is not an ideology but an approach to politics .
That is , it is not a set of specific ideas about how the world is run or how it should be run , like liberalism , conservatism , communism , or anarchism .
Rather , it is a way of engaging in politics , and it is a method that can be used by any ideology or cause .
I define fanaticism as the unconventional , extraordinary political mobilization of the refusal to compromise .
Fanaticism is an approach to politics , driven by an ardent devotion to a cause , that seeks to draw clear lines between friends and enemies in order to mobilize friends and moderates in the service of that cause .
It is willing to use direct action or other unconventional means to achieve this .
AK : Fanatics draw clear lines between friends and enemies .
But the “ enemy ” camp seems a lot bigger , because it includes moderates in some sense .
In your talk , you say that one of the main features of fanaticism is its attempt to “ squeeze and put pressure on the moderate middle . ”
In your paper “ The Freshness of Fanaticism , ” you dissect the concept of “ moderation . ”
In that same essay , and in “ Zealotry and the Jeremiad in American Political Thought , ” you critically tackle terms like “ consensus , ” “ compromise , ” and “ concession . ”
Could you talk about that a bit ?
JO : Moderation ( not tolerance or reason ) is the true antithesis of fanaticism .
While the essence of the fanatical approach to politics is a ) the refusal to compromise , b ) the desire to mobilize others based on that refusal , and c ) the use of extraordinary means to mobilize them , moderation is an approach that regards compromise as the essence of political engagement .
A moderate approach to politics seeks to negotiate a “ common ground ” that all parties can agree on .
The fanatic divides the world into friends ( those who are with you ) , enemies ( those who are against you ) , and moderates in between ( those who need to get off the fence ) ; the moderate believes that with a little bargaining , we can all be friends .
Extremism seeks combat , moderation seeks consensus .
Now , I do n’t believe that extremism is always the better approach .
If there is a potential to find common ground between you and your adversary , then you should seek it .
But when compromise would violate your most closely held principles , or when your opponent refuses to compromise , or when your opponent claims to be helping you but really is oppressing you , then it makes sense to consider an extremist approach to politics rather than moderation .
Slavery is a good example of this .
Phillips argued that any compromise with the slave masters perpetuated slavery , since any such compromise would have to acknowledge the master ’s right to own slaves — precisely the principle that the abolitionists rejected .
Thus any “ moderate ” position regarding slavery , Phillips argued , was objectively proslavery .
The master must either free his slaves immediately and unconditionally , without asking for compensation , or abolitionists must fight against the slaveholders .
Anti-abortion militants use the same logic : you cannot compromise with baby - killers , they say .
In fact , the right uses this logic all the time , and it ’s one of the reasons why they win so often .
I think the left would do well to consider this logic sometimes , too .
Why should we compromise over the destruction of our environment ?
Why should we compromise over the exploitation that is inherent to capitalism ?
Why should we compromise over people ’s right to live , love , and work wherever they please ?
AK : Could we say that left - wing fanaticism is an attack on what would normally be seen as liberal “ allies ” ( in the same way that right - wing fanaticism is an attack on moderate conservatives ) ?
JO : Not necessarily .
The goal is to push the liberals to your side , not to push them away .
But sometimes the way to do that is to yank them off the fence rather than gently invite them down .
The anti-abortion movement , for example , does n’t focus its energy on the pro-choice movement so much as it does on the “ moderate ” pro-lifers , i.e. those who believe that abortion is murder but wo n’t act like it .
They use guilt , argumentation , pleading , scolding , and all sorts of other tactics to push the moderate middle to act as if abortion really is murder .
Left extremists could learn from this approach .
Let ’s take immigration and the debate over the recently passed Arizona law SB 1070 , for example .
( I ’m a member of the Repeal Coalition , an organization that seeks to repeal all anti-immigrant laws in Arizona . )
The current debate is between nativism ( “ Kick them all out and militarize the border ” ) or reform ( “ Let a few of them stay , kick the rest out , and militarize the border ” ) .
You can see that despite all the huffing and puffing in the media , it ’s actually a very narrow debate .
An extremist approach would create a third pole : the only moral option in a global economy is to let all human beings live , love , and work wherever they please , and let all humans participate in those affairs that affect their daily life .
This approach places reform uncomfortably between nativism and open borders .
Then , the extremist needs to relentlessly attack reform , showing how its “ moderate ” approach is objectively the same as nativism : it breaks up families , weakens workers ’ power , and threatens the liberty of all people ( for example , liberal New York Senator Charles Schumer ’s plan for a biometric national identity card in his immigration reform bill ) .
The extremist wants to show that there are really only two options in this struggle : nativism or freedom , “ baby - killing ” or “ life , ” slavery or abolition .
AK : OK , in your talk you said fanaticism 1 ) refuses to compromise on basic principles ; 2 ) divides the world into friends and enemies ; 3 ) puts pressure on the moderate middle ; 4 ) tries to build a constituency ; 5 ) engages in legal and illegal direct action ; and 6 ) seeks to build a new cultural hegemony or common sense .
I ’m on the same page when I think about who we can call a fanatic , but things get a little cloudy for me when you start talking about who is n’t a fanatic .
You mention that the insurrectionary anarchist tradition does n’t fit the bill , and I get the sense that you think the same about the “ propaganda of the deed ” tradition in general .
So let ’s take an example :
In 1892 , Alexander Berkman tried to assassinate Henry Clay Frick , in retaliation for Frick ’s use of murderous Pinkerton guards to break the Homestead Steel Strike .
Berkman was part of an organized movement and , I think , he fits all of your criteria for effective fanaticism .
As he explained : “ The chief purpose of my Attentat was to call attention to our social iniquities ; to arouse a vital interest in the sufferings of the People by an act of self - sacrifice ; to stimulate discussion regarding the cause and purpose of the act , and thus bring the teachings of Anarchism before the world .
The Homestead situation offered the psychologic social moment . ”
Does Berkman qualify ?
Why or why not ?
Also could you elaborate a bit about why most contemporary anarchist direct - action groups do n’t qualify ?
JO : No , I absolutely regard insurrectionary anarchists and other anarchists who engage in “ propaganda by the deed ” to be fanatics .
( And again , I do not use the term as an insult , but as a description of how they engage in politics . )
Anyone who engages in extraordinary , unconventional means in order to mobilize people according to an absolute , uncompromising principle is an extremist .
That includes anarchists , militant pro-lifers , Earth and Animal Liberation Front cells , militant white supremacists , self - immolating Buddhist monks during Vietnam , the Weather Underground , guerrilla armies , and many in the anti-globalization movement .
My beef with the insurrectionary anarchists is twofold : their specific way of engaging in extremism fails to build a constituency , and they turn “ direct action ” into a revolutionary strategy itself rather than seeing it as but a part of an effective strategy .
I discuss both of these more below .
AK : One way to measure the effectiveness of a fanatical act is , you say , “ by the fanatic ’s own criteria , did the fanatic change the common sense of society ?
Did they build a new hegemony ? ”
You see John Brown ’s attack on Harpers Ferry as effective because he “ just knew his moment .
John Brown … caught his historical moment correctly and his tactics fit perfectly with the time . ”
Regarding insurrectionary anarchists , you say “ I ’ve seen a lot of shit blown up .
I ’m willing to see more , but I have yet to see those bombs produce the free society . ”
To what degree , then , is our assessment of such acts limited to historical hindsight ?
Let ’s say that , tomorrow , a fanatic powered by a clear ( for her ) vision and strategic plan , does something extreme that she sees as an attempt to change society ’s common sense , to win hearts and minds .
How , in the here - and - now , do we evaluate the act ?
JO : I do n’t think historical hindsight has much to do with it .
Brown knew immediately that he had sparked a civil war over slavery .
Paul Hill , who murdered abortion provider Dr. John Britton in 1994 , believed until the moment of his execution in 2003 that his action would spark a similar revolution against abortion .
He was deluded , and everyone but him and his small band of supporters knew it .
To understand her historical moment , the fanatic needs an analysis of the key contradictions of this society and a strategy for how her actions will dramatically ratchet up those tensions .
A fanatic seeks to blow open a conflict that is bubbling just beneath the surface .
To do this , she must understand the nature of the conflict and she should have some sense of how her action will lead people to rise up .
Too often extremists just wing it and hope people will spontaneously react .
For example , attacking a fur farm in 2010 might be a morally righteous action , but to think it will lead to an anarchist revolution ( or even a movement against fur ) is based on naïve hope rather than political analysis .
I think there ’s always a bit of luck involved , too — Brown was lucky to be the right person at the right time — but effective extremism should rely on strategy and judgment more than hope and luck .
AK : For me , the central aspect of your model of effective fanaticism is the question of building a constituency .
It ’s the one element that makes or breaks the deal ( since so many groups / individuals can fulfill your other criteria ) .
Could you define “ constituency ” a little better ?
In some places , you seem to mean something similar to “ cadre , ” a small group of devoted activists .
In others , it seems to refer to the broader public , winning over the masses .
Also , do you mean the same thing by “ base ” as you do by “ constituency ” ?
JO : I borrow the term from Phillips , who argued that the goal of abolitionist fanaticism was to build a constituency , or a group of supporters who believed that slavery was a sin , that it must be abolished immediately , and who were willing to make it so .
But what kind of supporter is the extremist trying to attract ?
A constituency can mean a small cadre of dedicated activists , a larger group of people willing to act occasionally on behalf of one ’s cause ( a “ base ” ) , or public opinion generally .
Effective fanaticism , in my opinion , wants all three , but its main goal is to transform the “ common sense ” of society , or what Gramsci calls hegemony .
The abolitionists , for example , sought to change the “ common sense ” notion that slavery is a “ necessary evil ” or that Black people are “ naturally fitted ” for slavery .
Radical environmentalists seek to change the “ common sense ” that capitalism can save the environment .
Extremists are engaged in struggles for hegemony .
They are striving to change the very notion of what is politically possible .
One problem with insurrectionary anarchy , the ELF , and similar groups is that their approach to politics , while admirably extremist , does little to transform public opinion .
When you rely on a cell structure like the ELF does , for example , you might make it difficult for the police to infiltrate you ( though a lot of historical evidence suggests otherwise ) .
But you also make it nearly impossible for your movement to grow , since cells are n’t really able to create other cells .
( Advocates of the cell structure like to think that one successful cell will inspire others to form spontaneously , like mushrooms in a cow pasture , but that has never happened historically . )
When you rely exclusively on spontaneous uprisings , as the insurrectionists favor , you deny the need for organizations and other structures to take that insurrectionary fervor and use it to build free institutions .
Both of these approaches assume that inspiring the masses will lead them to action .
But inspiration is not enough .
Effective extremism connects the fiery sparks of direct action toward a strategic purpose — to squeeze the moderate middle , push most of it into the “ friends ” camp , and spark a battle between friends and enemies — the outcome of which will redefine society ’s notion of what is politically possible ( “ common sense ” ) .
Too many anarchists groups fail to put pressure on the moderates .
They attack them in their publications ( often in a sectarian manner ) , but their political activities rarely focus on squeezing them .
I ’d like to see that change .
AK : For me , there ’s a bit of a disconnect between the fanatical act and the nuts - and - bolts efforts to build a constituency / movement .
You say the latter “ is hard work , knocking on doors and saying ‘ Can I talk to you ? ’ or going into car washes or going into church and talking . ”
Now , this is the sort of work that liberals do as well .
Greenpeace does it ; countless moderate reform groups do it , NGOs and non-profits do it .
I ’m confused about how the two link up .
Is it simply that fanatical groups combine traditional reformist tactics with non-reformist “ principles ? ”
JO : It ’s important to distinguish extremism as an approach to politics from political tactics or actions that people often regard as “ extremist . ”
Extremism cannot be reduced to a tactic ; it is a way of engaging in politics that seeks to draw sharper lines in society ( friends vs. enemies ) rather than blur such lines .
In doing this , the fanatic can and should draw on a variety of strategies and tactics , some of which includes direct action , like battling cops , and some of which includes hum - drum stuff , like organizing meetings .
Knocking on doors is done by Greenpeace and the Repeal Coalition alike , true , but Greenpeace does it to “ raise awareness ” — and raise money .
The Repeal Coalition does it to boil down all the opinion on immigration in Arizona into two camps — those for the freedom to live , love , and work wherever you please , and those who are against that freedom .
AK : That makes sense .
In a way , I think I ’m somewhat seduced by the idea that fanaticism simply means some sort of bad - ass , dramatic , sensational act — or maybe that I ’m defining “ act ” too narrowly .
You seem to be saying that the uncompromising “ message , ” and how / where it is delivered , is just as important , just as fanatical .
As are the organizational structures fanatics set up to do something with the fervor they inspire .
Is that right ?
JO : Yes , I think so .
Fanaticism is an approach to politics , and any approach involves strategy and style as well as tactics .
We all get seduced by the dramatic act — that ’s the extremist ’s objective .
But we should be careful not to reduce extremism to just the dramatic act .
AK : In a number of recent “ insurrectionary ” uprisings — for instance , the actions protesting UC budget cuts and the privatization / rationalization of education in general — there has been a lot of criticism from within the ( moderate ) left about the actions of ( radical ) activists who sought to push things in a more conflict - oriented direction through occupations , confrontations with cops , alleged attacks on ruling - class homes , etc .
These radicals , largely anarchists , are often labeled “ elitist , ” “ vanguardist , ” and “ anti- democratic ” in relation the broader movement they are a part of .
How do you respond to similar arguments against fanaticism ?
JO : Sometimes these criticisms make sense and sometimes they do n’t .
They make sense when activists come to fetishize a certain tactic — occupying a building or marching in the streets , for example — without a plan for how this will transform public opinion .
They just want to do it because it ’s “ radical . ”
Their main point is to let the world know , “ We are anarchists , we ’re radicals , we ’re not liberals or Stalinists . ”
It ’s an expression of identity politics rather than a political strategy .
Such action is often in fact elitist because it ’s a way of saying , “ Do it our way or else you ’re a reformist , an authoritarian , etc . ”
But there is nothing inherently revolutionary or anarchist about any particular tactic .
Communist parties throughout Latin America ( and in Nepal today ) used armed struggle , for example , but they used this “ radical tactic ” in order to change government policies , not bring about a new society .
But these criticisms of radical activism are wrong when they condemn any sort of direct action or violence .
Moderates are wrong to assume that reform is better than radical change , that nonviolence is always superior to violence ( or militant self - defense , as some prefer to call it ) , or that the goal of political activism is to bring all sides to the table to make a compromise .
Sometimes the most effective way to get things done is to refuse to compromise and to play by the rules of the system — especially since these rules are typically rigged in favor of the powers that be .
The effective extremist seeks to break up these rules in a way that creates political space for more action from the grassroots , and that closes space for the moderate and the enemy .
You can see that I ’m critical of insurrectionary tendencies , but my intention is to be constructive , not dismissive .
Frankly , I ’d much rather see people engaged in unselfconscious direct action than build vanguard parties .
Even direct action that ’s not very well thought out can sometimes create new political opportunities that no one could have predicted .
It can also lead to disasters , of course , but vanguard parties pretty much only lead to disasters .
AK : That makes me want to rephrase the question I asked earlier about Alexander Berkman .
I realize now that my question is n’t so much “ Who qualifies as a fanatic ? ” as “ Who qualifies as an effective fanatic ? ” I ’d like to hear who , other than the abolitionists , you think has pulled off effective fanaticism on the left .
I ask because I think that successes and failures are equally instructive in terms of strategy , but I ’m not clear about what you consider successful on the left since the abolitionists .
JO : The early Wobblies come immediately to mind , as well as some of the nineteenth and twentieth century anarchist and communist groupings .
I ’d also include Malcolm X and the early Panthers as effective fanatics .
The civil rights movement is an interesting case to consider — the Deacons for Defense were quite militant and SNCC used a political approach that is similar to extremism , and even Martin Luther King Jr. called himself an extremist in “ Letter from Birmingham Jail ” — but I need to give this more thought .
I ’ve mentioned the group I belong to , the Repeal Coalition , though that ’s a modest effort and most of our tactics have been fairly conventional so far .
Of course , we have to take “ effective ” with a grain of salt .
These groups or persons were effective in that they drew sharp lines and mobilized others based on those lines , and were willing to engage in unconventional politics to do so .
But they ultimately failed to bring about a free society .
( If they were effective in this sense , then AK Press would be as big as Amazon and beer would be free . )
But then again , no one has done that .
AK : Why does the left need fanaticism ?
Where does the left need fanaticism ?
Regarding immigrant issues , you say
In your talk , “ I guarantee you , if someone comes in and does some act of extremism at the border or elsewhere , that does n’t just shock the nation but that galvanizes people into action , we will see this movement grow by leaps and bounds in a way we have n’t seen . ”
Could you be more specific — if not about the nature of the imaginary act itself ( though that would be a fun thought exercise ) , then at least about the contours of acts that successfully “ galvanize ” people ?
Any other critical nodes or fulcrums you see out there ?
JO : The left is stuck between long - term efforts for “ progressive reform ” on the one hand and spectacular but largely one - off expressions of direct action on the other .
A fanatical approach to politics justifies and defends taking action — including direct action — in defense of principles that cannot be compromised .
But it uses that action to build a constituency and transform public opinion , not simply to “ inspire ” people .
Effective extremism provides people with an entrée into a movement where they can put their inspiration into practice .
Again , the abolitionist movement and hopefully the Repeal Coalition are examples of this .
The journal Race Traitor once ran an editorial titled , “ When Does the Unreasonable Act Make Sense ? ”
In this time of ecological crisis , new forms of apartheid , and a global economy that is spinning out of control , I think it ’s time for the left to seriously ask that question , as well as this one : “ What kind of unreasonable act makes the most sense ” ?
These questions are the essence of the fanatical approach to politics .

And here ’s the audio of the talk that inspired the interview :
A Proxy War in Peru
AMAZONAS REGION — Last Easter , as the rains subsided in the Peruvian Amazon , the rivers and roads opened up and campaign season began .
" There are two groups fighting for control of our land , " one aspirant told a crowded plaza halfway through Good Friday celebrations in Imacita , a river port deep in the northern jungle .
" One represents big business and industry .
The other protects the environment and stands up for the poor . "
The speaker was Joel Shimpukat , a 44 year - old Awajun Indian schoolteacher .
This was his first speech in the run up to October ’s regional elections , in which Shimpukat hopes to capture the district mayor ’s seat .
He alternated between Spanish and his native Awajun for the benefit of a mixed audience , echoing in form and content the bipolar politics that resonate across Peru and most of Latin America .
Lambasting the gold mining and oil exploration underway nearby , he finished with a fist in the air : " We must never forget June 5 ! "
There was little chance of that .
Many of those standing in the plaza that night were , like Shimpukat , survivors of the bloody confrontation between natives and police that took place 150 miles upstream the year before .
June 5 , 2009 marked the 55th and final day of a native uprising that shut down highways , river ports and oil facilities across the breadth of the Peruvian Amazon , staunching the flow of people and goods in over half the country — an impressive strike even by Latin American standards , and one that ended disastrously following a government crackdown .
The blockades were a response to the rapid encroachment of industry into the Amazon , which in recent years has blown up local disputes into regional arguments over environmental preservation and economic development — which in turn have become a sort of proxy war between Latin America ’s increasingly polarized left and right .
Three quarters of Peru ’s Amazon has been leased to foreign oil corporations in the last 10 years , with mining and logging interests close behind .
Just across the border in Ecuador , the native Achuar nation is prosecuting the world ’s biggest - ever lawsuit against an oil company , Chevron , with the vocal support of President Rafael Correa .
Billions of dollars of investment hang in the balance in the Amazon , and both sides consider the stakes to be even bigger than that .
" We are now living a cold war in which foreign governments are participating , " Peruvian President Alan García wrote a few weeks after the uprising .
" Let ’s remember that Peru is a vital center for continental matters .
It was necessary [ for Spain ] to conquer Peru in order to dominate South America … and now the same is necessary for the regressive and dictatorial model that wants to dominate Peru . "
His strongest critics would say the same thing .
Peru ’s problems began in 2008 , when García issued a number of land reforms that were widely seen as weakening both native title and environmental regulations .
Outraged at not even being consulted — Congress had fast - tracked the reforms , arguing they were necessary to keep Peru in compliance with its new U.S. free trade agreement — native groups eventually coordinated the biggest paro in the country ’s history , demanding that Garcia repeal 10 of the most troublesome decrees .
But the government refused to negotiate while the protesters remained in place , and so a weeks - long stalemate ended as everyone feared it would : with the deaths of 33 people and 200 more sent to hospital — 82 of them with bullet wounds — following a botched attempt to clear a blockade outside the northern town of Bagua .
The " Baguazo , " as local press dubbed it , was an iconic FUBAR that fit neatly into the regional narrative and provoked exaggerations on all sides .
First a stunned - looking Alberto Pizango , president of Peru ’s Amazon Indian Association ( AIDESEP by its Spanish acronym ) called a press conference that afternoon to declare that a " genocide " had taken place ; he was soon echoed by García ’s main ideological rivals .
" What is happening in Peru , " said Bolivia ’s Evo Morales , " is the genocide of the indigenous people . "
In Venezuela , Hugo Chávez left it to his minister of indigenous people , Nicia Maldonado , to agree .
" We absolutely and categorically condemn this genocide against our brothers , " she said .
Then the story took an unexpected turn , when it emerged that 23 of the dead were police .
Another high - ranking officer was missing and also presumed dead .
" A genocide of police is what it was , " concluded García .
Pizango and dozens of AIDESEP leaders were formally charged with sedition and inciting violence ; they all went into hiding , and Pizango eventually fled to Nicaragua .
Peru ’s ambassador to Bolivia was called back to Lima ( the one in Caracas had already been recalled over a previous spat two months earlier ) .
" International communism is trying to create chaos in Peru , " García insisted — a loaded reference in a country where the communist - inspired Shining Path guerrilla rebellion claimed 70,000 lives in the 1980s and 1990s .
" Who does it suit for Peru not to use its gas , not to find more oil , to be unable to better exploit its minerals ? " he asked , claiming the protesters had been funded and manipulated by " foreign agents . "
Yet there was no question that García ’s administration had suffered a PR disaster .
Yehude Simon , the prime minister , was shamed into resigning , while Congress repealed two of the 10 laws that provoked the strike , promising to reconsider the rest .
Petroperu , the state - owned enterprise in charge of handing out oil concessions , suspended auctions on all remaining Amazon blocks .
It seemed Peru ’s natives had scored a historic victory .
A year later , however , their mood is far from victorious ; grim determination is more like it .
Shimpukat ’s campaign is shrouded by the arrest warrant still out on him for his role in organizing the Bagua blockade .
( When I asked the chief of Bagua ’s police why he had n’t arrested Shimpukat or others like him , he said the situation was " too delicate " for police to enter the jungle communities . )
" For a while , " Shimpukat recalled , " the government was circulating pictures of me as one of the so - called foreign agents , " a conclusion authorities had apparently arrived at because of Shimpukat ’s thick moustache .
Most natives do n’t have facial hair , but thanks to sporadic intermarriage with Spanish descendants , exceptions do crop up .
" Of course there are foreign agents at work here — they are the countries Garcia signs free trade agreements with ; they are the mining and oil companies who help themselves to our Amazon . "
The government has indeed kept the door open to one of the world ’s richest collections of natural resources , and is expecting more than $ 20 billion in foreign direct investment over the next two years .
Petroperu recently announced it would start auctioning the remaining Amazon oil blocks , adding to the 82 foreign companies who already hold concessions here .
Peru ’s production of gold , silver , copper , zinc and lead already rank in the world ’s top six .
Upcoming hydroelectric projects in partnership with an energy - hungry Brazil are now set to rival the recent oil and gas boom .
As García likes to point out , this is what fed Peru ’s legendary growth spurt over the past decade , climaxing at 9.8 percent in 2008 .
Peru weathered both its own and Wall Street ’s crises with the best - performing stock market on earth in 2009 , and the IMF forecasts this year ’s growth will top Latin American charts at 6.3 percent .
But aside from Lima ’s construction boom , signs of prosperity are hard to find .
Corruption certainly swallows its share of the profits , but that is n’t the only reason wages have failed to rise with the GDP .
One thing that has risen in tandem with the scale of resource extraction , however , is the number of protests .
Five years ago , the national ombudsman ’s office in Lima recorded eight " socio- environmental " conflicts in the country ; as of March this year there were 126 .
In 60 percent of them , the government refused to negotiate until violence broke out .
Bagua was exceptional in scale , but not in kind .
" The problem , " says Ivan Lanegra , an officer at the ombudsman ’s office , " is there ’s no overall development plan .
No one is managing the big picture .
The state needs to play a bigger role in regulating these projects and guiding the profits into proper institutions .
Until that happens , local communities will continue to feel there ’s no one looking out for them . "
After Bagua , the government did agree to negotiate with AIDESEP , but halfway through talks , the Ministry of Justice filed a motion to dissolve the group , labeling it a criminal organization .
( AIDESEP ’s lawyers successfully fought off the charges . )
The inquiry into what exactly happened at Bagua has been similarly acrimonious :
The special commission appointed to investigate the incident wound up breaking apart and producing two conflicting reports ; one , produced by government representatives , blamed the protesters for the outbreak of violence , and the other , produced by the commission ’s native members , blamed authorities in Lima .
Both investigations , however , concluded that there was no evidence of foreign intervention having influenced the crisis — an inconvenient finding , given that a conviction that foreign agitators are at work in Peru may be the only point of agreement between the two sides of the dispute in the Amazon .
Essential oils could be a cheap and effective alternative to antibiotics and potentially used to combat drug - resistant hospital superbugs , according to research presented at the Society for General Microbiology 's spring meeting in Edinburgh this week .
Professor Yiannis Samaras and Dr Effimia Eriotou , from the Technological Educational Institute of Ionian Islands , in Greece , who led the research , tested the antimicrobial activity of eight plant essential oils .
They found that thyme essential oil was the most effective and was able to almost completely eliminate bacteria within 60 minutes .
The essential oils of thyme and cinnamon were found to be particularly efficient antibacterial agents against a range of Staphylococcus species .
Strains of these bacteria are common inhabitants of the skin and some may cause infection in immunocompromised individuals .
Drug -resistant strains , such as meticillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) are extremely difficult to treat .
" Not only are essential oils a cheap and effective treatment option for antibiotic - resistant strains , but decreased use of antibiotics will help minimise the risk of new strains of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms emerging , " said Professor Samaras .
Essential oils have been recognised for hundreds of years for their therapeutic properties , although very little is still known about how they exert their antimicrobial effects in humans .
Australian aborigines used Tea tree oil to treat colds , sore throats , skin infections and insect bites and the remedy was sold commercially as a medicinal antiseptic from the early 20th century .
Various scientific studies have demonstrated that essential oils are not only well tolerated , but are effective against a range of bacterial and fungal species .
Their therapeutic value has been shown for the treatment of a variety of conditions , including acne , dandruff , head lice and oral infections .
The Greek team believes essential oils could have diverse medical and industrial applications .
" The oils - or their active ingredients - could be easily incorporated into antimicrobial creams or gels for external application .
In the food industry the impregnation of food packaging with essential oils has already been successfully trialled .
They could also be included in food stuffs to replace synthetic chemicals that act as preservatives , " they said .

Buried within the new Department of Defense Inspector General ’s report , " Contingency Contracting : A Framework for Reform , " is the eye - opening revelation that the Defense Criminal Investigative Service has nine open investigations into alleged " Terrorism - Related Acts " by " U.S. contractor personnel , U.S. Military , Government personnel . "
No other details are provided .
DCIS is the criminal investigative agency working for the DoD ’s Inspector General .
Ad Policy
I called the IG ’s office and asked them for information on these nine " terrorism - related " cases .
" When it comes to individual cases or ongoing investigations , they ’re not going to comment on that , " a spokesperson told me .
The " terrorism - related " investigations are part of more than 220 open investigations in DCIS ’s " Global War on Terror Investigations . "
Many of these relate to bribery , false claims , theft and export violations .
DCIS agents have federal law enforcement authority and have authority to make arrests .
I have asked the Inspector General ’s office in writing to provide any details on the terrorism investigations and will update this post if I receive a response .
Meanwhile , in a not shocking revelation , the IG report also documents how private contractors working for US Special Forces have been allowed to " perform inherently governmental functions : "
" Specifically , management and contracting personnel allowed contractors to administer task orders , determine what supplies or services the Government required , and approve contractual documents .
The contractors performing inherently governmental functions did not identify themselves as contractors .
For example , in 3 of 46 task orders , valued at approximately $ 18 million , contractors working for the Special Operations Forces Support Activity signed contractual documents as a Special Operations Forces Support Activity representative .
In addition , contracting personnel took direction and implemented contract changes from contractors working for their customers .
These conditions occurred because the Special Operations Forces Support Activity lacked internal controls and standard operating procedures on the performance of inherently governmental functions .
As a result , Special Operations Forces Support Activity may not have correctly administered and protected the best interests of the Government for approximately $ 82 million in task orders issued under the Special Operations Forces Support Activity contracts . "

Many people have wondered why the Asian StarCraft II Beta has been dominated by Zerg , while others have not .
There are two reasons for this .
Zerg have less than the Protoss and Terran in this game .
It 's quite a simple concept .
The Zerg have much less to work with .
Units usable in combat :
Zerg : 9
Terran : 12
Protoss : 14
This is a huge difference , especially when you consider that one of the Zerg units , the Ultralisk , is completely inferior to any other choice the Zerg have .
This brings us down to eight units .
Why does this make the Zerg better on the Asian server ?
Streamlined learning .
This is all that the Zerg has to work with .
That means , the best units , ideas and strategies boil down much faster .
There is simply less to test .
StarCraft II is a very complex game , with many , many factors contributing to any situation .
The Zerg have less of these factors .
You have a very limited number of options .
This does n't make playing the Zerg easier , per sey , it just makes figuring out how to player the Zerg right easier .
While other races are still around with three to five extra units , the Zerg already know what combination work and do n't work .
This makes every practice game a Zerg player plays worth more , as they are already past the testing phase .
There is one other reason , one which may weigh into it even more than the simplicity behind the previous reason .
It is in the players who chose Zerg on the Asian server .
First , let 's state some things that should be obvious and accepted .
1 ) Korea is better at RTS games than any other nation in the world .
2 ) StarCraft is by far the most competitive RTS game in the world , especially in Korea .
3 ) The absurd majority of skilled gamers in Korea play or have played StarCraft professionally , both because of the competition and rewards of the game .
4 ) Going back in time in professional StarCraft I , you will find , on average , more free - styled and free - thinking players , due to the game being less developed .
5 ) This is StarCraft II .
See # 3 .
So with these facts in mind , we will now go over which StarCraft I professional gamers are playing StarCraft II .

EDIT : so are u saying that the constant nerfing of the zerg race is in parts a unrewarded change to the overall balance of sc2 as a game .
and i also gather that you agree with tester that the major reason that zerg seems so strong in korea is that not much other sc korean pros have took the time and effort into learning sc2 and becoming top players themselves ?
also what is your personal opioin on the patch toward the zerg race , do you think it is over done or do you think it was justified .
you seemed to not talk about the patch to much in the write - up
also love how the only toss you mentioned to be playing the games alot is regarded as the best in korea ^^

It makes perfect sense that when there is less to practice you can get better faster than the other races .
So you 're saying its like being able to win piano competitions because you only play on the white keys ?

That makes absolutely no sense .
By the same logic Terran should be dominating Protoss since ' there are less units to use ' .

No no it was a good patch , you know just make one essential unit not very viable anymore and give no buff to other already un-viable units .
LOVE U BLIZZARD <3
>
I guess to be fair it is a beta and the balance has been great consedering , just annoying how the Zerg race will be very very hard to play correctly for about a week .
LMAO - " What have the top Korean Zerg players been doing since the last Zerg nerf in Patch 12 ?
Well , I can't speak for all of them , but two of the very top players , Cool [ fOu ] and TheWinD , have both been practicing Terran on the Asian Ladder .

Thanks for the brief but always insightful writeups .
I would have to agree with you , since I guess the ease of figuring out Zerg has always been with me on a subconscious level .

ooni Profile Blog Joined March 2010 Australia 1492 Posts Last Edited : 2010-05-17 06:08:47 # 14 well , to be honest I agree to some degree .
The reason for Zerg domination in my opinion is that Zerg ( race itself ) is very macro intensive race and that over time caused Zerg to be stronger meta game wise .
Because of that very fact people make more solid builds over time ( repetition like you said , though IMO it is combination of lack of diversity and the way zerg works ) it becomes more effective .
A cheesing player will be better ( much much better matter of fact ) in short term but in long run macro oriented play will prevail over others .
Once Protoss and Terran become macro heavy ( roughly 30 % of T&P player currently tends to be ) then you will see Zerg get crushed even more ~ ^_____^

I guess my point is I really do n't think any arguments saying " better players play this race " is really valid nor can it be proven unless you had a tournament with all the good players in .
However this does n't necessarily mean the players are better but rather that the race perhaps WAS better before the nerf which means that would n't of solved anything anyway .
As that is the jux of your argument I must kindly disagree with Artosis ( who is awesome and helps the community so much ) on this .
I also think it 's really sad that people are jumping ship just because their race got nerfed .
+ Show Spoiler [ HDH results ] +
Idra just proved that Zerg ( the one with least usable units ) can ravage protoss ( which has the most so should be the hardest to prepare for by Artosis ' logic ) in HDH .
Does n't the fact that there are so many great players in Korea who take it seriously ( which you stated ) mitigate the fact that more " prof " players play Zerg ?
Those progamers all lose plenty of games and I 'd bet money there are plenty of non-famous players who are doing as good if not better than people on that list .

While I agree , I also have to say it is n't like T is hard to figure out ... make Maruaders ... give them medivacs and enough AA and yeah , walk over the opposing force with stim .
This works unless Z makes Broodlords , then you go on forums and whine .

Failsafe Profile Blog Joined July 2006 United States 1298 Posts # 19 I agree with your conclusion but I do n't think it 's necessarily because Zerg has less units to work with .
Most Terran players are only aware of one unit : the Marauder , but that does n't make Terran a dominant race because they limit themselves to a single unit .
Zerg initially performed better for two reasons .
One is that base management is much easier as Zerg .
All the races have to add tech buildings , but only Protoss and Terran have to look at their base in order to add supply depots and pylons as well as look at their base in order to add production facilities .
Zerg does n't have to look at its base to create Overlords and as long as the Zerg remembers to Larva inject , it should n't need to create additional hatcheries aside from expansions .
The second major factor is that the rate of growth of an uncontrolled Zerg economy is ridiculous .
With larva injection you can essentially saturate an entire expansion in a single round of production .
Neither Protoss or Terran can compare to that .
They can only stifle the economy 's growth .
The third , somewhat lesser factor in Zerg 's initial stellar performance is that Zerg units are all simple .
Aside from the Infestor , there 's no real micro management necessary .
You just 1a and possibly try to work up some flanks , but otherwise there 's really no micro in the Zerg game .
There are no unit abilities like Stim , Siege , Viking Transform , Force Field , Guardian Shield , Blink , etc that Zerg players need to manage .
Plus , Zerg units all move insanely fast on creep which complements factor # 2 ( Zerg 's insane econ growth ) in that Zerg really only needed to concern itself with defensive play while the insane Zerg macro kicked in and raped everything .
What 's changed is that more and more timing attacks and more and more deception have become standard for Terran and Protoss when facing Zerg .
Now Zerg is much less able to expand wildly and take advantage of the unchecked Zerg economy 's growth speed .
I think all of this essentially agrees with your conclusion that Zerg has been over - nerfed .
Between the development of better play for the other races ( which certainly did take longer ) and Blizzard 's ridiculous balancing , Zerg is fucked .
But can you really blame Blizzard ?
The guys trying to balance this game and making the big decisions probably do n't understand SC2 any more than say your average D+ BW player understood BW .

Take a good , honest , unbiased look at the Korean SC2 scene as I have just described it .
Sorry but i personally find it hard to believe that your look at it is unbiased .
I mean , you even say at the bottom you have likely missed out on some of the top players and the fact you are infact a zerg player yourself also makes this questionable .
Also , i personally think this roach change is also to pave the way for ultras to become a big part of zerg late game just like they were in broodwar zvt and zvp ...
I would be very surprised if things are left the way they are currently .
ps : you can no longer call any other race , the easy race .
hah . :p
edit : also people are overreacting so bad to this roach change .
It changes the late game maxxed out armies dynamic ( which again , i think will be counter - acted by ultralisk changes in future patches ) and changes the early game timings slightly , but its not any worse than the roach increasing from 75 minerals 25 gas to 87 minerals 25 gas in cost for mid-game , which is where most standard games are won and lost anyway .

Federal undercover investigators found workers at federally financed child care centers frequently misrepresenting information about applicants ’ job status and earnings to fraudulently register ineligible children , the Government Accountability Office said in a report issued Tuesday .
The investigators posed as parents or guardians of fictitious children and used bogus pay stubs and other documents to seek to register for day care services at Head Start centers , the report said .
In 8 of 15 undercover tests , employees lied on federal forms about the applicants ’ family income and other information to gain approval for the ineligible children , the report said .
Head Start , an agency of the Health and Human Services Department ith a budget of about $ 9 billion this year , provides child care and other services to nearly one million children nationwide .
To be eligible , children must be from families whose incomes do not exceed 130 percent of the poverty level , or about $ 28,600 a year for a family of four .

SACRAMENTO ( Reuters ) - California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday compared the state ’s predicament to that of weaker euro zone economies and called for scrapping the state welfare system to close a $ 19.1 billion budget gap .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger proposes his $ 83.4 billion state budget plan in Sacramento , California May 14 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Max Whittaker
The movie star turned governor said California , the most populous U.S. state with an economy that would be the eighth largest in the world , faced the same dilemma of dismal growth and budget gaps as Greece , Spain and Ireland .
California ’s government has been living beyond its means and has little choice but to cut $ 12.4 billion in spending over the remainder of this fiscal year and the next , Schwarzenegger told a press conference in Sacramento .
“ You see what is happening in Greece , you see what is happening in Ireland , you see what is happening in Spain now , ” Schwarzenegger said , referring to swelling deficits and austerity measures that have concerned investors worldwide .
“ We are left with nothing but tough choices . ”
Democrats and Republicans , who must muster a two - thirds majority to pass a budget , are likely to ignore many of his suggestions in a debate which , if it follows recent history , could drag on for months .
Democratic State Senate President Darrell Steinberg told Reuters that lawmakers in his party , who control both chambers of the legislature , could not support Schwarzenegger .
“ The cuts are absolutely unacceptable , ” Steinberg said , adding that instead of slashing spending Schwarzenegger should help Democrats delay business tax breaks .
Republican Assemblyman Jim Nielsen , the vice chair of the budget committee , said both sides felt the “ absolute imperative ” for immediate action and praised Schwarzenegger ’s decision not to push for new taxes .
“ That would simply fund the broken budget at the higher levels that are not sustainable , ” he said .
BONDS SELLING FAST
Thanks to stronger than expected revenue early in the year and new finance rules the state will be able to pay debt coming due in May and June , although it could face problems late in the summer , Schwarzenegger said .
Investors have scooped up recent offerings of California debt with high yields , convinced by state payment guarantees .
Meanwhile schools have cut teachers , social services are drying up and most state employees face regular furlough days .
The spending cuts in Schwarzenegger ’s proposed $ 83.4 billion 2010 - 2011 budget include eliminating the CalWORKS welfare program and many child care programs and cutting funding for local mental health services by 60 percent .
California ’s budget deficit had been estimated at $ 19.9 billion at the beginning of the year .
Since then some revenues have come in higher than expected but opportunities to make cuts have also dried up , concerning credit agencies who now rate state debt only a few notches above speculative , or “ junk , ” status .
Schwarzenegger in January acknowledged his proposed spending cuts for health and welfare programs were “ draconian . ”
But the state already has some of the highest income and sales tax rates of any U.S. state .
“ There is something wrong with our system .
That is what I ’m trying to tell people .
There are going to be people screaming for more taxes -- we ’ve done that , ” Schwarzenegger said .
“ Let ’s stimulate the economy and let ’s create the jobs .
That ’s the important thing . ”
He called on lawmakers to tackle growing costs for the state pension fund and to reform its tax system , which relies heavily on volatile personal income and capital gains taxes for revenue .
Outside the event , protesters denounced Schwarzenegger ’s plan , chanting “ Shame on you ” .
Handicapped activists said they feared losing caregivers funded by the state .
“ I might as well just die , ” said wheelchair - bound Carmen Rivera - Hendrickson , who relies on daily in - home health care .
It ’s been some time since we received any new details on Chrome OS , Google ’s web - focused operating system for netbooks .
But that ’s about to change in a couple weeks .
We ’ve learned from multiple sources that the Taiwanese computer manufacturer Acer will launch Chrome OS devices at the Computex Taipei show , which will be held from June 1 to June 5 .
We do n’t yet know what devices Acer will be launching .
Chrome OS is designed for netbooks , but Google has also mentioned the possibility of bringing it to other device types like smartbooks and tablets running ARM processors .
Smartbooks look like netbooks but run processors like those from ARM which are designed for mobile devices .
Recently , there ’s been talk of Samsung developing ARM - based smartbooks running Chrome OS , as well as support for nVidia Tegra 2 devices .
It ’s still unclear how Chrome OS - equipped netbooks will coexist with those running Google ’s Android mobile operating system .
We ’ve known since early 2009 that Android netbooks would begin popping up this year , and even Acer announced its intention to sell them .
My prediction ?
Google will probably settle on Android for tablets eventually — it ’s already built for multitouch support , and its analogous to Apple bringing the iPhone OS to the iPad .
Android ’s small footprint also makes it easy to use in integrated devices , like Google ’s upcoming “ Dragonpoint ” TV project with Sony and Intel .
Chrome OS , which is clearly better suited for devices with keyboards and trackpads , will find itself on more netbooks and smartbooks .
Last year , Google CEO Eric Schmidt mentioned that the two projects will merge over time ( see Google ’s graphic below ) , so eventually the differences might not matter .
Google initially planned to release Chrome OS sometime in the second half of this year .
Acer ’s Chrome OS device launch in early June fits into that schedule , although we ’re not sure when those devices will be available for purchase .

Dubbed the " rape capital " of the world by Margot Walhstrom , UN Special Representative on Ending Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones , Eastern DRC is seen as the epicenter of sexual violence .
A study , jointly put together by Oxfam , the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative , and Panzi Hospital in Bukavu , looks at more than 4,000 rape cases and provides exact data on when and where rapes occur and who the victims and perpetrators are .
To find out more , IRIN Radio's Louise Tunbridge spoke to Susan Bartels , physician and lead researcher on the study , to find out what was most striking about her findings .
BARTELS : I think there were two things that were most shocking .
The first of those were that so many women were actually attacked in their own homes , in the supposed safety of their own homes .
We had 57 % of women who reported this .
And often those attacks on individual homes occurred at night when the women were sleeping with their spouses and their children .
And that was very shocking to me because I think we have a sense that one 's own home is a safe place somewhere you can sleep and be comfortable .
The second thing that was very surprising to me was the dramatic increase in the number of rapes that were perpetrated by civilians .
In 2004 , civilian perpetrated attacks accounted for less than 1 % versus 38 % in 2008 and this trend suggests an acceptance of sexual violence by the Congolese society - sort of normalization - and that was very surprising .
TUNBRIDGE :
You 've said in your report the findings on rape show why the peacekeeping force MONUC still has a vital role to play at a time when there is talk of them leaving the country .
But if rape goes so deep in society , why do you think peacekeepers can do anything ?
BARTELS : Yes , I agree completely .
I think the UN peacekeeping forces will be essential in helping to stop the rapes that are perpetrated by armed combats .
Because even if there was a dramatic increase in the number of attacks perpetrated by civilians , even in 2008 , the majority of attacks were still reportedly by armed combatants .
So , I think by keeping the UN peacekeeping forces in place , they can play a crucial role in protecting civilians from attacks that would be committed by armed combatants .
To address the second of the civilian perpetrated attacks , I think that there needs to be a lot of work to start bringing perpetrators to prosecution .
And although DRC has fairly robust laws on sexual violence , at this time very poorly enforced and I think to help ease this sexual violence within civilian communities we need to really look at the security reform and enforce a zero tolerance policy .
TUNBRIDGE :
There have been a lot of reports of rape in DRC , so do you feel these stories can get the issues through in a way that it is going to be felt and noticed .
BARTELS : You might expect that after reading so many stories and spending so much time just listening to the brutality of such attacks you just might become immune to it .
And I can certainly say that that was not the case .
That each and every story remained so unique and was so powerful , and despite thousands of stories , I could still find myself chilled just reading the story of an individual woman and what she had experienced .
TUNBRIDGE :
And what do you feel your report can achieve ?
Can it make a difference ?
BARTELS : I think the strength of our report is that it is a large database , with over 4300 women involved .
I think that Panzi hospital located in Bukavu is at the heart of the conflict area so it 's very well situated to be helping many of the women who are directly affected by the sexual violence .
And I also think , because Panzi hospital is located there and continues to operate , it has the advantage of being able to collect information over a longer period of time , as opposed to a study group who goes in and collects information perhaps over several months .
And I think that having the ability to collect that information over time is what allowed us to look at the trends throughout the 5 years and really to understand how the sexual violence is seeping into civilian life .
You know , our role as researchers is to provide information that helps us understand what is happening within the sexual violence epidemic and to provide basically the data that shows the suffering and that point to perhaps measures that would be helpful in relieving the suffering .

Our prospective study reports a 21.2 % incidence of NDEs in out - of - hospital cardiac arrest survivors .
It also suggests that the occurrence of NDEs is connected to higher initial petCO 2 , higher arterial blood pCO 2 , and previous NDEs .
Higher serum levels of potassium might also play a role .
To our knowledge , this is the first prospective study to report a possible correlation between NDEs and CO 2 .
It is still not clear whether NDEs occur before , during , or after the period of cardiac arrest [ 3 ] .
During cardiac arrest , the petCO 2 falls to very low levels , reflecting the very low cardiac output achieved with cardiopulmonary resuscitation [ 31 ] .
Higher levels of petCO 2 therefore indicate better cardiac output and higher coronary perfusion pressure [ 32 ] .
Our findings concerning the association between initial petCO 2 and the occurrence of NDEs therefore support the hypothesis that NDEs occur during the cardiac arrest .
On the other hand , the association between higher pCO 2 upon admission and the occurrence of NDEs might suggest that NDEs occurs after the cardiac arrest .
But higher pCO 2 upon admission might simply reflect higher initial petCO 2 .
Nevertheless , it is known that CO 2 changes the acid - base equilibrium in the brain , which can provoke unusual experiences in the form of bright light , visions , and out - of - body or even mystical experiences [ 3 , 5 ] .
Some earlier studies have shown that inhaled CO 2 , used as a psychotherapeutic agent , could cause NDE - like experiences [ 33 , 34 ] .
Therefore , we can conclude that CO 2 might be one of the major factors for provoking NDEs , regardless of when NDEs occur .
As far as we know , serum levels of potassium were assessed only in one study [ 3 ] .
The mean level of potassium in the NDE group was slightly lower in comparison to the control group , but no significant differences were found .
As our study managed to associate serum levels of potassium only with the higher NDE score , and not also with the higher incidence of NDEs , no firm conclusions can be drawn at this point .
Also , the possible mechanism of the effect of potassium in the NDEs has not yet been established .
Alternative theories found the explanation for NDEs in quantum theory , which suggests that consciousness may arise from quantum processes within neuronal microtubules [ 35 ] .
The recent work of Bernroider and Roy suggests that quantum entanglement in the ion channels ( especially in the potassium channel ) of brain cells underlies information processing in the brain and , ultimately , also consciousness [ 36 ] .
Although untenable and purely theoretic , this possible connection between potassium channels in the brain and the mechanism of consciousness ( and therefore the possible mechanism of NDEs ) deserves further investigation .
Available data on the role of oxygen in provoking NDEs is ambiguous .
Although one physiological theory [ 5 ] suggests that anoxia ( or hypoxia ) might be the cause for NDEs , Parnia and colleagues [ 3 ] found a higher mean pO 2 in peripheral blood ; however , due to an insufficient sample quantity , a univariate analysis was not performed .
In our study , the NDE group had a lower mean pO 2 than the non-NDE group , but this difference was not statistically significant ( Table 2 ) .
Nevertheless , this finding is in favour of the theory of anoxia [ 5 ] and supported by several studies that reported NDE - like experiences in decreased cerebral perfusion ( resulting in local cerebral hypoxia ) in rapid acceleration during training of fighter pilots [ 37 ] , in hyperventilation followed by the valsalva maneuver [ 38 ] , and in people exposed to high altitudes [ 6 ] .
The proposed mechanism is the induction of hyperactivity of N - methyl D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors by hypoxia , which induces hallucination and might induce NDEs [ 10 ] .
Previous prospective studies on NDEs reported an 11 to 23 % incidence between cardiac arrest survivors [ 3 , 25 – 27 ] , which is consistent with the incidence found in our study .
We have not demonstrated the connection between younger age and a higher incidence of NDEs .
In fact , the mean age of the NDE group was lower than the non-NDE group , but this difference was not statistically significant .
Previous studies have shown that NDEs more often occur in patients younger than 60 years of age [ 3 , 27 , 28 ] .
The age difference in our study might be overlooked due to an insufficient number of subjects .
It is also true that almost 70 % of patients in our sample were younger than 60 years .
The mean age of patients in our sample was lower ( for almost 10 years ) than in the two largest prospective studies of NDEs in cardiac arrest survivors [ 25 , 27 ] .
This difference might also be the reason why we were not able to demonstrate any age differences in the occurrence of NDEs .
Our study confirmed the findings of other studies on NDEs that sex [ 25 , 27 ] , level of education [ 25 , 28 ] , fear of death [ 25 ] , time until ROSC [ 25 , 28 ] , medication during resuscitation [ 25 , 28 ] , serum level of sodium [ 3 ] , and religious belief [ 25 ] are not associated with NDE occurance .
It also confirmed previously reported findings [ 25 ] that patients with previous NDEs are more likely to have repeated NDEs in case of a new cardiac arrest episode .
The questionnaire proved to be a reliable instrument for assessing NDEs also in Slovenian .
The Cronbach 's α of the questionnaire in the original study was 0.88 [ 20 ] and our result ( 0.875 ) was almost the same .
Our study suggests that some physiological factors or processes might be important in provoking NDEs .
On the other hand , the experiences induced by neurophysiological processes mostly consist of fragmented and random memories and confused experiences unlike the real NDEs that are clear , highly structured and easily recalled [ 3 , 25 ] .
It is not thought possible to explain NDEs only in terms of physiological processes .
Most likely multiple physiological factors are involved [ 5 ] .
Clearly , the presence of NDEs pushes the current knowledge of human consciousness and mind - brain relation to the edge of our understanding .
The main strength of our study is its prospective design .
With a consecutive recruitment of the patients and the inclusion of three of the largest Slovenian hospitals , the selection bias was reduced as much as possible .
The use of a standardised scale for NDEs ensured the consistency of NDEs reports .
The number of patients in the sample is the main weakness of our study .
Therefore , some important differences might have been overlooked and the results should be interpreted with care .
Also , receiver - operator characteristic curves for defining a threshold CO 2 were not produced due to too small a number of patients .
The weakness is also the fact that almost 70 % of the patients in a sample were younger than 60 years old , which could affect the incidence and the demonstration of age differences in NDEs .
ROME , Italy —
They are used to secrecy , to hiding their feelings , to waiting in the shadows for their men .
But now a group of women who have had intimate relationships with Catholic priests has decided to speak up against celibacy .
As sex abuse scandals once again rock the Catholic Church , the 39 Italian women who are , or have been , in longtime sentimental and sexual relationships with Catholic priests have penned an open letter to Pope Benedict XVI , denouncing compulsory celibacy as a “ torn up shroud . ”
In the letter , the women describe the closeted lives they lead as companions to priests and ask the pope to consider that , perhaps , their men can only fulfill their priestly duties with their lives fulfilled by marriage .
“ In order to become effective witnesses to the need for love , they need to embody it and experience it fully , in the way their nature demands it , ” the letter said .
“ Is it a sick nature ?
A transgressing one ? ”
A Vatican spokesperson , as is usual in these cases , declined to comment on the letter or on the women 's stories .
But several women who signed and supported the letter agreed to speak with GlobalPost about their relationships with priests .
Antonella Carisio , 41 , had always been engaged in parish life , so she did n’t think there was anything wrong with spending a lot of time with Edecir Calegari , the Brazilian priest with whom she ran the parish youth center .
Then one evening in June 2006 , when she was driving him back to the parish house , she says Calegari kissed her .
“ I wrote him a letter that night , telling him I was sure it had been a mistake , that we should forget about it , ” said Carisio .
When they met again the next night , to “ clarify ” things , he kissed her again , “ and that ’s how our relationship started . ”
It lasted for two and a half years .
Calegari often slept at Carisio ’s house .
She says he even insisted on being introduced to Carisio ’s son as his mother ’s partner , not just as the local priest .
“ Everyone in my family knew , even my grandmother .
They were all very nice to him , ” she said .
Eventually , the couple was discovered : A fellow priest found one of Carisio ’s letters in the parish house and reported Calegari to their superiors .
He was moved to Rome and the two vowed to stay together : “ When he left , he even gave me an engagement ring . ”
But close to the Vatican and under constant scrutiny from superiors , Calegari quickly recovered confidence in his priestly identity , and agreed to do something he had promised Carisio he would never do : go back to Brazil as a missionary .
Calegari now says that he regrets “ deeply ” what happened , “ also because I hurt her .
It was a mistake . ”
He said he is happy in Brazil and thinks that putting an end to the relationship was the right choice : “ I never thought of leaving the priesthood .
Antonella and I were very close , she was a friend and a confidant , but I was never in love with her . ”
“ This is something that happens quite often , ” said Stefania Salomone , a 42 - year - old office manager from Rome .
“ Most of them are not ready to give up their life as priests for a woman .
They want to have it both ways . ”
Some of the relationships are not even sexual ones .
Salomone 's priest never went beyond hugging her , she said , and when he finally admitted that there was something “ real ” between the two of them , he said it was over .
After this and another similar experience , she started a website for women who are in relationships with priests and is now in contact with about 50 other women .
“ There is never a happy ending , ” she said .
Priests cannot stand to give up being “ sacred ministers , ” “ God 's intermediaries , ” for the sake of the daily routine of married life .
Celibacy is compulsory for Catholic priests in the Western church , but its critics always point out that this rule is not spelled out by Jesus in the Gospel .
Most of the Apostles , Salomone pointed out , were married , and so were the presbyteroi , the elders who exercised priestly authority in the first Christian communities , as described in the Act of the Apostles and St. Paul ’s letters .
Though it was a common rule in the first centuries of the Christian era , celibacy in the Catholic Church started to be more strongly enforced only in the 11th century , and then after the Council of Trent , in the aftermath of the Reformation .
Priests continued to have clandestine relationships , of course , but it was not until the Second Vatican Council in 1962 that many of them came into the open and left their offices .
According to the semi-official Vatican magazine La Civilta Cattolica , nearly 60,000 priests left the church to get married after the Second Vatican Council .
However many men still feel both callings — to the priesthood and to marriage — and struggle with the rules .
“ One of the most recurring statements of priests to their ' companions , ' ” wrote the women in their open letter , “ sums it up in a few words : ' I need you in order to be who I am , ' that is , a priest . ”
The church ’s reassignment of Calegari represents a typical response , according to the letter , which says that the church often rewards priests who give up their relationships with a promotion .
B. , a 40 - year - old lawyer from Tuscany who asked not to be named , said the priest she was involved with “ was also critical of the church 's backwardness and of compulsory celibacy . ”
But this changed after the first months , when a new bishop gave the priest new career opportunities , which he quickly seized .
That did n't push him to end his relationship with B. : “ I was closing his gaps , filling up his emotional holes , ” she said .
“ He never had real doubts , no interior drama .
Once he was sure that I was there for him , he was OK . ”
Carisio said that like B. she never asked Calegari to renounce his vocation .
He had entered seminary when he was just 12 and , she said , “ he could n’t deal with the idea of leaving the priesthood . ”
This would have meant giving up his whole life : “ He could n't forsake the status and the privilege of being a priest , he could n't admit to being just a man . ”
Leaving the priesthood would have meant “ dealing with real life ” for the first time , coping with issues such as finding a job or paying rent .
But it was not just practical concerns .
Carisio said Calegari received idolizing letters from friends back home and was admired by his family .
“ He had always been told that he was dedicating his life to something superior , that trumps everything else . ”
Abandoning celibacy would have meant “ stepping down from the pedestal he had been set upon . ”
Along with Calegari's “ egoism and cowardice , ” Carisio also blames his superiors for their “ hypocrisy . ”
Their only concern was to protect him from her : “ We should take them as models of love and brotherhood , but they do the contrary .
They were shocked that a priest could fall in love , and then betrayed him . ”
Calegari disagreed , saying his dedication to celibacy is strong .
“ Changing the church 's rule would n't be a solution , ” he added .
“ I studied in Rome with priests from Eastern Catholic Churches , who are allowed to marry , and they have worse problems .
I made a mistake and it just happened , but I did n't have strong feelings . ”
Compulsory celibacy , write the women in their letter , is a “ human law ” that contrasts sharply with the everyday experience of priests ' lives , even though the church presents it as “ God 's will . ”
The result is that most relationships eventually end in shame .
“ Why , ” they ask the Pope , “ all this destruction in the name of love ? ”

Guest commentary by Martin Vermeer
On December 7 , 2009 the embargo expired , and my and Stefan ’s joint paper ‘ Global sea level linked to global temperature ’ appeared in the Proceedings of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences .
It had been a long time coming !
But this post is not so much about the science as about the process , and about how a geodesist from Helsinki and an oceanographer from Potsdam , who to this day have never even met , came to write , to the surprise of both of us , a joint paper on sea level rise .
My own entry into climatology happened only a few years ago .
A significant trigger was RealClimate , which I had learned to appreciate as one of the rare reliable Internet sources amidst the junk .
Contributing to the oft - slandered science is my small ‘ thank you ’ and revenge as a scientist .
As I remember , it was the commenter calling himself Rod B. who enquired , sometime August 2008 , what the story really was with Rahmstorf ( 2007 ) .
Trying to answer , I ended up reading the paper and getting interested .
What seduced me was the simplicity of this , so - called semi-empirical approach : linear regression of sea level rise dH / dt against temperature T , yielding two unknown parameters : a regression coefficient a , and an intercept , or ‘ equilibrium temperature ’ , T 0 .
See our Ups and downs of sea level projections for a more detailed explanation .
The curve of temperature as a function of time over the 20th century has three parts : a steep rise in the beginning , a flat middle part commonly attributed to aerosols , and a very steep upswing at the end .
Physically one would expect for the curve of the sea level rise rate dH / dt as a function of time to look rather similar , as indeed it does : this justifies the Rahmstorf ( 2007 ) approach of regressing the one against the other .
Looking more carefully however one sees that the dH / dt curve has slightly more of an S - like shape , turning downward in the middle , before swinging up again at the end .
This suggested to me that , in addition to a proportionality to temperature T , sea level rise would also contain a term proportional to the time derivative of temperature , dT / dt .
In other words , global sea level would be a good global thermometer , but with a ‘ quirk ’ .
I could even think of a physical mechanism for such behaviour .
I contacted Dr. Rahmstorf , proposing the idea : one would expect the ocean surface to warm up rapidly to completion , contrary to the deep ocean and the continental ice sheets .
This would argue for a term , in addition to the secular a ( T – T 0 ) term , of form b dT / dt .
Stefan ’s response was cautious ; not surprising , as being something of a media figure in Germany surely means that he has to contend with his share of cranks .
But he suggested I look myself into the idea , which I subsequently did : in for a penny , in for a pound .
I downloaded Stefan ’s script , modified it , did the first computations with the same real tide gauge and temperature data Stefan had used — surprise : negative b. Hmmm , strange .
That was for real data from the real Earth ; what would happen if I applied the extended relationship to simulated data from the same general circulation model ( actually , an Earth system model ) for the period 1900 - 2100 that Stefan had used in his paper for testing his relationship ?
This model was in one essential way very much simpler than reality : it completely lacked the contribution of land ice melting to sea level .
Stefan helpfully sent me Matlab snippets and model output , and indeed I got it all working .
What was more , the disagreement found by Stefan for the late 21st Century — between sea level rise as predicted directly by the model , and indirectly through the semi-empirical relationship between temperature and sea level rise — went almost completely away when using the new , extended relationship .
With a positive value for b , just as expected from theory for an ocean surface water response .
Global sea level against time .
Top , sea level rise , bottom , sea level itself .
Red , sea level from observations ; blue , with uncertainty band , the fit from global temperatures using our new relationship ; black , the fit using Stefan ’s original relationship .
The thin red wiggly curve shows annual sea level values .
That was encouraging , but what again about the real data ?
Remember that this is real observational data from tide gauges , altimetric satellites and meteorological stations , warts and all , with a very imperfect spatial sampling both for the tide gauge data and for the surface temperature data .
Nothing like the clean , formally perfect model output of truly global mean surface temperature and sea level .
At that point I was about to give up .
I remembered however Stefan mentioning a ‘ reservoir correction ’ and decided to see if that made a difference .
It was not hard to find Chao et al. ( 2008 ) , who had painstakingly compiled a list of all man-made reservoirs the world over , and the amount of water stored in them .
I fitted a simple arctan function through their water storage curve and added that to Stefan ’s already extended script .
All that water , up to 30 mm sea level equivalent , that should have been in the ocean was progressively kept bottled up on land as dams were being built : a known correction that should be applied .
Wow .
Introducing the b term had already improved the Pearson correlation r of fit from 90 % for Stefan ’s original relationship to 97 % ; nice , but hardly on its own compelling .
Bringing in the Chao et al. man-made reservoir correction brought it up to 99.2 % !
Slowly it dawned upon me that , hey , maybe I ’m on to something real here , something based in physics : it seems the world ocean can be a remarkably good global thermometer , once you get to know its quirks .
The world ocean , a pretty good global thermometer ( drawn using
GMT ) .
Stefan relates the moment when he realized that I had something worth publishing : January 16 , when he saw the results of the ‘ millennium run ’ that I had done on the data he had sent me .
All of the volcanic explosions over the last thousand years , which were translated first into top - of - atmosphere radiative forcing and then turned into sea water thermal contraction and a drop in modeled sea level , were faithfully reproduced in the sea levels obtained from the model temperatures by my new relationship !
A beautiful performance on what are large , rapid and erratically occurring excursions in both global temperature and sea level .
And that ’s how Stefan came on board .
With the small number of independent data points we needed to make sure we were not ‘ fitting an elephant ‘ , so I read up on statistics during winter 2008 / 2009 , and in particular , information theoretical methods like the Akaike Information Criterion .
The model intercomparison was useful for just that .
I ’m not the only one studying these ideas , and I learnt a lot from tamino and James Annan ’s Empty Blog.
Jaynes ( 2003 ) was also on my 2009 Christmas reading list ; Hypothesis testing , null and alternative hypotheses , confidence bounds and all that , is a traditional approach to statistics that is easily misunderstood and often misused .
Statistical refutations of “ silly null ” hypotheses abound — like the silly null of no relationship between temperature and sea level rise .
If this sounds all cryptic to you , I do n’t blame you .
Pick up Jaynes ( 2003 ) , it ’s an eye - opener .
As part of his contribution , Stefan tightened up the draft paper to be suitable for submission to Nature .
Nature gave us some very helpful reviews which we used to further improve our manuscript .
The most useful reviewer remark had to do with the extraction of water from underground aquifers , a process potentially almost as important as the artificial reservoir storage that we did take into account — only , nowhere in the literature was there an equally painstaking accounting exercise to be found as what Ben Chao and colleagues did for the reservoirs .
So , we settled for a sensitivity analysis , skillfully whipped up by Stefan .
Nature turned us down , like they do over 90 % of manuscripts ; had they accepted , the paper would have been out already in summer .
We resubmitted to PNAS who obtained three further helpful reviews , the paper was improved yet again and finally published in December .
As it happens , this landed it right on top of the Copenhagen meeting .
Stefan tells me that we have exchanged over a thousand emails in the run-up to this paper .
I see some poetry in that number being close to that of the East Anglia stolen email selection .
Easy , informal email plays a vital role in the work of climatologists , and the loss of trust in its confidentiality could be very disruptive for the science : if the internal discussions of an authoring team would have to be expressed with the same care as the finished product , not a lot of authoring would get done .
Would I have dared , or managed successfully , to submit to a top journal all on my own ?
Hardly .
It is an illusion to think that you can just enter a field that ’s not your own and become a productive researcher , whatever you might read or what denialists - of - service may pretend .
There is a lot of domain knowledge involved , and precious little of it is simple .
In this case , I did learn a lot ( and I continue to do so ) , but this takes both a willingness to learn , and great teachers .
RealClimate , and the community it represents , are an indispensable resource for that .
Still waiting for Al Gore ’s cheque …
P.s. Over at Nature Stefan has a commentary on sea level today .

BA today won a high court injunction which ruled unlawful the cumulative 20 - day strike called by the Unite union , on the grounds that it had not followed to the letter of the law the 1992 Trade Union Act .
In a sign of how cynical the tactic of using technicalities to close down strikes has become , BA 's objection rested on the union 's obligation to announce “ as soon as possible ” the results of the ballot , in terms of the number of yes and no votes and spoilt ballots .
In a move that places even more hurdles in the way of lawful strike action , the high court judge accepted BA 's case that the strike was unlawful because the results of the ballot had not been announced by Unite to each member by post , rather than through their website and union noticeboards , as is common .
Unite argued that BA was unable to find a single member of cabin crew unaware of the outcome , to no avail .
Like BA 's previous successful injunction against strike action by its employees over Christmas , the technicality it is disputing could in no way affect the mandate for strike action that has been presented by cabin crew .
81 % of members voted in favour of strike action on a turnout of over 70 % .
Instead , a clear message has been sent to employers that no matter how large or clear the vote for strike action is , the most trivial of technical points can be used to halt strikes .
A new employers ' strategy
Over the past year , the tactic of seeking high court injunctions against strikes on the basis of technicalities has been refined to an art by employers .
Following the successful injunction granted against a strike called by Unite at Metrobus in London in July 2009 , which again concerned the letter of the law on how to announce a strike not being followed , employers have taken out a number of injunctions with broad success .
Over the past five years , over 30 such injunctions have been sought , and all but one have been granted .
These rulings have further stacked the law in the favour of employers .
The wave of anti-strike legislation throughout the 70s , 80s , and 90s was bad enough .
It primarily aimed to conclusively outlaw secondary action and ban workers from calling strikes in mass meetings on the shop floor , and was coupled with an employers ' offensive and the destruction of much of industry in the UK , leading to defeats which the working class has still not recovered from .
While many on the left and in unions complain that the labour government never met the promises it made in opposition to repeal the anti-strike laws , in reality it has strengthened them , as described by Martin Mayer of United Left :
The Labour Government has not only refused to repeal the Tories ' anti-union laws , it has made them worse by a couple of very serious amendments to the legislation ( which were used by the Court of Appeal in the Metrobus case ) .
Following Labour 's victory in 1997 , the Unions lobbied the government to change at least one aspect of the legislation which required Unions to give an accurate list of names of those to be balloted for strike action .
The Government 's amendments did that by allowing Unions to declare their " check - off " membership by employee category and location , and separately their Direct Debit membership with an explanation of how that figure was arrived at .
However more significantly , the Labour Government 's amendments changed the whole emphasis of the legislation away from the Tories ' original intention , which was to protect union members from their own union by ensuring strike ballots were independent and democratic .
New Labour 's amendments made the whole rigorous balloting requirements and disclosure of information a protection for employers , so that they could adequately prepare for any strike action .
This means employers can claim that any deficiency in the balloting process affects their ability to prepare for a strike - in other words a bosses ' injunction charter .
Quote :
The most high - profile injunctions we 've seen recently have concerned on the one hand the union 's record - keeping in terms of membership and on the other its announcement of strike ballot results – either to employers or its members .
The strike by Network Rail workers was ruled unlawful because the ballot , as conducted by a third part hired by the RMT union , included workers who had left their workplaces or changed jobs without informing the union .
The 12 - day Christmas strike at British airways was declared unlawful because the union had balloted members who had accepted redundancy , although the letter of the law also states it would have been unlawful not to ballot these workers .
The union is obliged to provide detailed and accurate information of this kind to allow employers to prepare for strike action , though of course employers are not obliged to provide information about staffing to the union , basically giving them a permanent advantage – Network Rail , for instance , can move its signalling staff as and when it pleases , meaning the union 's records will never be 100 % accurate .
On the other hand they have concerned the announcement of results , which allows bosses to prepare for strike action and gives the time to scrutinise the information for the kind of discrepancies described above .
But what these rulings demonstrate is that the right to strike does n't really exist in the UK anymore , because they impose an onus on unions and consequences which do n't exist for other kinds of organisations .
It is unimaginable , for instance , that a council could be prevented from collecting its council tax payments due to inaccuracies in its database of residents , or that the results of the general election could be annulled due to irregular voter registration ( which certainly does happen – evidence of electoral fraud arises at every general election , including this one . )
In this way , smaller organisations with smaller resources like trade unions are obligated to meet higher standards of record - keeping than exist elsewhere .
The ability to gain these kinds of injunctions is a gift to employers because it keeps the right to strike , enshrined in International and European law there in theory , while outlawing it in practice .
The right to strike is enshrined in the International Labour Organisation 's Convention on the Right to Organise and Bargain Collectively , ratified by Britain , The Council of Europe 's Social Charter , ratified by Britain , and the UN's International Covernent on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .
In theory , Britain meets those requirements , in practice , any strike can be outlawed .
Employers are aware that even the threat of an injunction can draw out the organisation process of calling strike action , further demoralising workers , as was the case at Manchester Metropolitan University recently .
The Unions and ' Anti- Union ' Laws
Its worth making a point at this stage in case we are mistaken as arguing from the perspective of defending unions ' rights .
Unions are of course inconvenienced by this state of affairs , but on the other hand complex anti-union laws give them more scope for frustrating the initiative of their members .
Whether or not the unions ' want ' to impose anti-union laws is irrelevant , in practice they either have to do that or have their funds sequestered , any union which openly and flagrantly defies the laws will lose its right to protection from litigation and will be destroyed through the courts .
Union leaders will even invent laws that do n't exist to frustrate independent action by workers defending their interests .
For instance , during the Visteon occupation at Enfield last year , Unite bosses urged workers to end their occupation on the grounds that it was illegal .
Ex-workers at Ford - Visteon Enfield have described being terrorised with stories of how riot police would raid the factory and they'd be sent to prison for their occupation .
In fact , squatting is not illegal and they faced no such risk .
What matters is whether workers are able to struggle in their interests effectively , and what tactics allow that to happen .
I broke the law and I won
All of this paints a bleak picture – the inability to legally strike , unions losing any vestige of being organs for struggle and taking on the cowed , corporatist role they have in China , or held in the ex-Soviet countries .
But unions are permitted to exist within capitalism for a reason ; they function as a pressure valve , allowing anger and militancy to be channelled down restricted , legalistic paths .
Unions are able to represent workers to the employer , and negotiate the cost and terms of their labour .
The only other alternative form conflict can take is workers organising their own action through mass meetings , without official union mandates .
We saw a glimpse of what this looks like during the wave of oil industry walkouts last year .
Though there is no definitive split between the ' workers ' and the ' union ' in cases like this , with shop stewards often taking leading organisational roles , the strikes worked without a legal mandate and ignored every piece of anti-strike legislation since the 20s .
There was no ballot , and secondary action took place on a huge scale .
Whatever reservations we may have about the initial motives behind the strikes ( which are best addressed here ) , they showed that it is possible to take successful , large scale illegal industrial action without repercussions .
There have been a number of wildcat strikes at the Royal Mail in recent years too .
It is entirely possible that should there be enough of an appetite for action amongst workers in the coming years , we may see more action of this kind .
After all , in countries where striking is illegal , such as China , it happens frequently on an illegal basis .
On the other hand it is entirely possible that we could see a demoralised and cowed working class incapable of breaking with the unions and the official restrictions on strike action which now prevent it from taking place .
Either outcome is possible , but only one stands any chance of fending off the massive attacks on our living conditions which are in the pipeline .
Embedded in the euro and thus no longer in control of its own currency , Greece cannot take the easy way out of its debt by devaluing .
So Greece must either cut its spending sharply or default on its loans — which would badly damage German and French banks carrying a lot of Greek debt .
That is considered one reason President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has been so quiet on the Greek crisis , Mr. Fitoussi said .
The Greek deal “ is an indirect way of bailing out French and German banks , ” he said .
“ The French understood this from the start , but Germany did n’t seem to . ”
Katinka Barysch , an economist and deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London , said that that realization had hit home in Germany .
“ It might be unpopular for the Germans and Europeans to bail out Greece , but it will be even more unpopular for them to bail out the banks that owned Greek bonds , ” she said .
Thomas Piketty , the founder of the Paris School of Economics and a professor there , thinks that the demands on Greece , driven by a market frenzy , are simply too high .
“ Austerity can be justified , but 8 percent interest rates on a debt that amounts to more than 100 percent of gross domestic product is just crazy , ” he said .
“ They will have to restore their public finances and then pay back this huge debt at the same time — and Greek debt amounts to so little when you compare it to what was needed to bail out the banks ” last year .
“ Not only is this not going to help growth , it ’s going to end very badly , politically speaking , ” Mr. Piketty said , referring to Greece .
“ Taxpayers cannot accept this in the long run . ”
On Sunday , the Greek finance minister , George Papaconstantinou , forecast a deeper than expected recession of 4 percent for 2010 and 2.6 percent in 2011 , before the economy supposedly returns to growth of 1.1 percent in 2012 .
“ We will be in recession for the next few years , which means that we have to run faster to reduce the deficit , ” he said .
By now , everyone has heard that the teabaggers took over the Maine Republican Party last weekend at the state convention , adopting a far right - wing , extreme platform .
In addition , Maine GOPers spent the weekend trashing one of Portland ’s schools :
The Republican State Convention was held at the Portland Exposition Building , which is on Park Avenue , near the middle school .
Party members from Knox County caucused in a classroom used by eighth - grade social studies teacher Paul Clifford .
When Clifford returned to school on Monday , he found that a favorite poster about the U.S. labor movement had been taken and replaced with a bumper sticker that read , “ Working People Vote Republican . ”
Later , Clifford learned that his classroom had been searched .
Republicans who had attended the convention called Principal Mike McCarthy to complain about “ anti-American ” things they saw there , including a closed box containing copies of the U.S. Constitution that were published by the American Civil Liberties Union .
Maine Republican
Party leaders have issued a written apology to King students and teachers .
These GOP / teabaggers are out - of - control .
Portland is my hometown and while I do n’t know Paul Clifford , I do know people who do .
I ’m told that he ’s a great guy .
And , sounds it .
For the record , I did not go to King Middle School .
I went to Jack .
Kathleen Boyer suspects the mailman .
She said she could not think of anyone else in her neighborhood who would have complained about the two beehives she kept under a pine tree in her front yard in Flatbush , Brooklyn , leading the city ’s health department to fine her $ 2,000 last fall .
“ I was kind of surprised , ” said Mrs. Boyer , an art director with a media company .
“ People see us in our bee suit and they ’d bring their kids to watch us and ask us questions . ”
New York City is among the few jurisdictions in the country that deem beekeeping illegal , lumping the honeybee together with hyenas , tarantulas , cobras , dingoes and other animals considered too dangerous or venomous for city life .
But the honeybee ’s bad rap — and the days of urban beekeepers being outlaws — may soon be over .
On Tuesday , the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene ’s board will take up the issue of amending the health code to allow residents to keep hives of Apis mellifera , the common , nonaggressive honeybee .
Health department officials said the change was being considered after research showed that the reports of bee stings in the city were minimal and that honeybees did not pose a public health threat .
Federal Spending on Unemployment Insurance Increased Five - Fold Since 2005
WASHINGTON , April 6 / PRNewswire -USNewswire / --
Twenty - three percent of America 's unemployed have been jobless for a year or longer , the highest rate since World War II , according to a study released today by the Pew Economic Policy Group .
The report , A Year or More : The High Cost of Long - Term Unemployment , finds that this trend cuts across nearly every industry and occupation , and affects people of all ages and educational backgrounds .
The existence of such a large pool of people – 3.4 million – who have been out of work for so long has had a significant impact on the federal budget .
" The number of Americans who have been out of work for a year or longer is roughly equal to the population of Connecticut , " said Ingrid Schroeder , project director of the Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative , which produced the report .
" Their unemployment has a significant impact on their families , their communities , and our government 's bottom line . "
Over the past five years , federal spending on unemployment insurance has increased five - fold from $ 33 billion in FY 2005 to an estimated $ 168 billion in FY 2010 , half of which goes towards unemployment benefits beyond the traditional 26 weeks .
According to the report , people who are 55 or older account for a relatively small number of the overall unemployed population .
But , once these workers become unemployed , nearly 30 percent remain jobless for a year or longer , the highest rate of any age group .
Similarly , workers who have a post - secondary education are less likely to be unemployed , but once they lose their jobs , they may remain out of work for an extended period .
Twenty - one percent of unemployed workers with at least a bachelor 's degree have been out of work for a year or longer , as compared to 27 percent of unemployed workers with high school diplomas and 23 percent of unemployed workers who have less than a high school degree .
" A Year or More launches our new Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative with its mission to provide fresh insight to inform the public debate on pressing economic and policy issues , " said John E. Morton , managing director of the Pew Economic Policy Group .
" With unemployment of a year or more at its highest level in nearly seven decades , this should be of great interest to policy makers grappling with legislative solutions and their potential effects on the federal budget . "
The Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative , a program of Pew Economic Policy Group , seeks to increase fiscal accountability , responsibility , and transparency by providing independent and unbiased information to policy makers and the public as they consider the major policy issues facing our nation today and the alternative choices to addressing them .

Inmates from the old prison at Bagram have been moved elsewhere
The US airbase at Bagram in Afghanistan contains a facility for detainees that is distinct from its main prison , the Red Cross has confirmed to the BBC .
Nine former prisoners have told the BBC that they were held in a separate building , and subjected to abuse .
The US military says the main prison , now called the Detention Facility in Parwan , is the only detention facility on the base .
However , it has said it will look into the abuse allegations made to the BBC .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) said that since August 2009 US authorities have been notifying it of names of detained people in a separate structure at Bagram .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The ICRC is being notified by the US authorities of detained people within 14 days of their arrest , " a Red Cross spokesman said .
" This has been routine practice since August 2009 and is a development welcomed by the ICRC . "
The spokesman was responding to a question from the BBC about the existence of the facility , referred to by many former prisoners as the Tor Jail , which translates as " black jail " .
ALLEGED 'SECRET ' JAIL ABUSE
Beatings by US soldiers during arrest Prisoners deliberately prevented from sleeping Relatives not notified where detainees are held Lights kept on in cells at all times US denies abuse allegations " We are being notified about persons at the Bagram Theatre Internment Facility [ now Detention Facility in Parwan ] since Feb 2008 , " the ICRC spokesman added .
In recent weeks the BBC has logged the testimonies of nine prisoners who say they had been held in the so - called " Tor Jail " .
They told consistent stories of being held in isolation in cold cells where a light is on all day and night .
The men said they had been deprived of sleep by US military personnel there .
In response to these allegations , Vice Adm Robert Harward , in charge of US detentions in Afghanistan , denied the existence of such a facility or abuses .
He told the BBC that the Parwan Detention Facility was the only US detention centre in the country .
Hilary Andersson investigates detention at Bagram in ' Bagram Airbase ' on BBC Radio 4 at 1702 BST ( 1602 GMT ) on Sunday 16 May 2010 .

Finance Minister Bill English has signalled the Government is again considering partial state asset sales - including Kiwibank .
At a post -Budget lunch in Christchurch today , English told business leaders that National would " get to grips ' ' with its position on state asset sales in the next eight months .
He revealed the Government was conducting a stock - take of its assets and their worth and would produce an " investment statement ' ' next year .
'' It seems to me , and I have checked this , that there is a strong demand among the mums and dads for a Kiwi investment model and if we put product into the market people would buy it .
Would I be right about that ?''
A few hands went up in the room .
'' In fact I think there would be a bigger proportion of the population than that would have a crack at it .
So we will have a think about it , '' English said .
'' My guess would be there 's a lot of demand for good share value and it would certainly help us to be able to free up that capital .
" But we have made undertakings to the public and we certainly wo n't move anywhere without getting a mandate to do so , '' English said in answer to a question about asset sales .
A good example was Kiwibank , English said .
It had got to a size where it needed either a government guarantee or '' an awful lot of capital ' ' .
If there was any asset that was regarded as risky by credit ratings agencies it was a rapidly growing bank .
'' So one option would be to go to the market and raise capital .
So keep crown ownership , majority crown ownership and raise the rest of the capital from the market .
So who 'd buy into that . ''
A member of the audience , sharebroker Jenny Moreton , said a lot of her clients would be interested in shares in Kiwibank .
English said the Government was intending to next year produce an ' ' investment statement ' ' which would tell the story of its investments and their value .
At present there were about $ 220 billion .
That included about $ 40 b of state - owned enterprises , nearly $ 80 b of financial investments and about $ 60 b of social assets such as schools and hospitals .
While the Government had a policy of not selling assets in this term the Government had been spending time on getting to grips with what investments it had .
It had no visibility of what happened to the assets and had not in the past paid much attention to them .
He said the Television New Zealand business was '' going through the floor ' ' .
After the lunch he said both of the Government 's network assets , TVNZ and New Zealand Post , were being hurt by new technologies .
New Zealand Rail was '' a black hole of complexity '' to which it had committed recently another $ 750 m .
'' This is the price of nostalgia , '' English said .
Asked later was he softening up for asset sales in the future English said '' No no , we are just outlining the position . ''
Progressive Party leader Jim Anderton , who founded Kiwibank when he was a minister in the previous government , said the bank was a huge success because it was publicly owned .
" National 's threat to sell Kiwibank is economic vandalism , " he said .
" National repeatedly promised not to sell Kiwibank ... people worried about Australian banks buying Kiwibank will immediately be concerned . "

Numerous pirate groups are holding more than 350 hostages A Russian warship is rushing to assist an oil tanker bound for China which has been hijacked by Somali pirates .
The Marshal Shaposhnikov was heading towards the Moscow University , which was attacked 900 km ( 560 miles ) off the Somali coast , officials said .
The 23 Russian crew on board are reported to have locked themselves in the ship 's radar room .
But a BBC reporter says the Russian warship is unlikely to intervene as it could put the hostages ' lives at risk .
Big prize
Shots were fired at the 96,000 - tonne tanker from two speedboats in the dawn attack , the ship 's owner said .
The BBC's East Africa correspondent Will Ross says the oil tanker is a big prize for the pirates who , based on previous hijackings , are likely to release the cargo and crew only once a multi-million - dollar ransom has been paid .
While the international war ships have prevented some attacks in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden , it is widely felt that the solution to ending piracy is on land , he says .
Over the weekend an Islamic insurgent group took control of one of the main pirate bases on the Somali coast .
The pirates had already fled and our correspondent says is not yet clear whether this was part of a wider effort by the insurgents to stamp out piracy .
For now the pirates have moved towards other bases along the coast and at sea the hijackings continue , he says .
Numerous groups of pirates are currently holding more than 350 hostages as well as about 20 ships at various bases around the country .

ASH SHURA , Iraq — Technically , American soldiers have stopped fighting in Iraq .
But they can fire back when attacked , which happens frequently in this village of wheat and barley farmers , as well as an uncomfortable number of Baathist insurgents .
So much so that , while United States troops in nearly all other parts of the nation are quietly preparing to withdraw , soldiers stationed here are fighting what looks , for now , like the last American combat in the seven - year war in Iraq .
“ They only attack Americans , ” said Capt .
Russell B. Thomas , the commander of Alpha Company of the First Battalion of the Third Infantry Division ’s Second Brigade .
They may only attack Americans now , but with all combat troops scheduled to leave Iraq by the end of August , military commanders worry that this area in northern Iraq offers a glimpse of a post - American Sunni insurgency , led by former Saddam Hussein loyalists intent on overthrowing the Shiite - dominated central government .
Supporters taunted rivals after Wembley victory ...
Gloating Chelsea supporters reportedly hacked into Manchester United 's phone system to taunt their rivals about their FA Cup and Premier League double .
According to the Daily Mirror , callers who contacted United on Saturday were greeted with " We are the champions " instead of the usual message saying the club would open for business again on Monday .
A United spokesman confirmed the incident last night and stated an investigation was underway .
" It did happen , but we got to it quite quickly .
An investigation is underway and if we find the culprits we will decide where we go from there , " the spokesman told the Mirror .
The Blues finished one point ahead of United at the top of the league table and beat Portsmouth 1 - 0 in the weekend showpiece .

Nothing inspires fear and obedience in your minions like appearing before them as a giant floating head .
Just ask the Wizard of Oz .
Now the middle managers of the world can pretend they are great and magnificent with the advent of a hologram system that allows you to teleconference in awe - inspiring 3D .
ICT Graphics Lab displayed this new system at their booth at SIGGRAPH earlier this summer .
Just like in Oz , a person was able to sit behind a curtain and appear before viewers via special cameras , a projector and a spinning mirror .
The effect is wonderful , and sometimes hilarious .
While holographic teleconferencing may be a wonderful application of this technology , the effects could be seen in a far wider arena .
ICT can broadcast your face in real time , but they can also do the same with almost any image .
Pre -recorded images can be rotated and manipulated and viewed in a full 360° arc .
The possibilities for modeling and sharing 3D images are amazing .
You can also scale large recorded images ( like someone ’s full body ) down to fit in the head - sized viewing area .
Hopefully we ’ll see this scaling incorporated into the teleconferencing system .
How cool would it be to have real Star Wars style communication in your home or office ?
While some may define true holography as involving phased laser light , ICT took a somewhat simpler approach .
The secret is an A - frame made of two slightly concave mirrors and a really smart timing algorithm .
Project an image onto a mirror and it appears at some point in space .
Rotate the mirror and you can trace that point in a full 360° arc .
Rotate fast enough , and each point in space can have multiple images shown per second .
Basically each point in space gets its own simple animation .
With the right timing , you can show the left eye and right eye slightly different images and make an object appear in 3D .
Sounds complicated , looks awesome .
For real - time teleconferencing , a person sits in front of a few cameras .
These cameras can develop a 3D image of someone using some special lamps that illuminate the face with a wave pattern .
If you ’re really interested in the technical aspect of it , the third video explains it pretty well .
Suffice to say that the combination of lighting and cameras allow someone to appear as a 3D hologram without using a true 3D scanner .
This makes the conferencing faster so you do n’t have a lag between the adoring public and Max Headroom .
Now , while ICT has managed to create a great way of viewing a 3D image , the use of a high speed rotating mirror has negated any possibility of getting close to the hologram .
I ’d really love to see the combination of the tactile holography we discussed before ( also seen at SIGGRAPH ) and 3D object projection as seen with ICT .
That would open up a really great opportunity for full - body holographic telepresence .
Right now , however , trying to touch an ICT image would likely get your finger chopped off .
Not so good .
Also , while the teleconference head can make eye - contact , which is huge , it is still prone to glitches .
Vertical tracking allows people at different heights to see the corresponding correct portion of the face , but see if you notice how certain parts of the face seem to cut in and out during the videos above .
ICT may need some upgrades in computer processing speeds and projector resolution before these artifacts are corrected .
While ICT ’s head hologram has some amazing features that far exceed traditional teleconferencing , I ’m not sure it ’s going to catch on .
You need a special setup and special recording equipment to get it to work .
It may be a select few who are willing to make such an investment when you can use a $ 150 monitor and a $ 50 webcam to accomplish a 2D version .
The 360° image viewing may catch on for object modeling , but again , that ’s not a guarantee .
I think the biggest promise of this technology may be that it shows how many approaches there are to creating realistic 3D images .
Some day we ’re going to have lifelike real time holograms – there ’s too many paths for them all to fail .
Which is good news for those of us who have underlings we need to impress .
Come my Singularity Hub interns , gaze upon my floating head and FEAR ME !
Ripped off from Inspired by the neat Inspired by the neat
In B flat , here 's a little interactive piece of music .
Play some subset of the videos , starting them whenever the spirit moves you .
I like to think the instrument playing is n't " bad " so much as " idiosyncratic " , like , you know , Indie music , or Ed Wood films .
Are you finding the same thing I am ?
Where you ’re having a casual conversation with a friend , and you ’re in the middle of saying something … well , not exactly secret , but not the sort of thing you want shared with the world … and you stop dead , suddenly worried that it might end up in their Twitter stream ?
When I ’m talking to someone with a blog , a Twitter feed or even a Facebook account ( which , these days , means nearly everyone ) , I ’m often just a little guarded .
I have my own guidelines and boundaries when I ’m dealing with other people ’s information – basically , if there ’s any ambiguity , I ask permission before I share – but I know other people draw the line differently .
Sometimes they ’ll reveal a confidence but change a few details to protect identities .
Or maybe they ’d never do that , but they ’ll readily tag an embarrassing party photo of you on Facebook .
While some people lay down hard and fast rules about the new online etiquette , the reality is things are still a lot more fluid than many of us realize .
You ’ve just had lunch with a potential client ; do you tweet that ?
You shot a hilarious video at the company picnic ; do you upload it ?
And do we all just assume we ’re all on the record , 24 - 7 , until and unless we agree otherwise ?
Several years into the social media revolution , we ’re still only making baby steps toward some kind of shared understanding of the terrain we ’re walking on together .
And in some ways , netiquette seems as nebulous a concept as ever .
Consequences of Muslims Targeting Civilians
Posted in notes by Imam Zaid Shakir on 2010-05-06
This essay , written in the immediate aftermath of the failed New York City bomb attempt [ 1 ] , will examine some of the theological implications of Muslims violating civilian immunity .
I have written elsewhere why attacks against innocent civilians are in opposition to fundamental teachings of Islam .
Unfortunately , there are some Muslim ideologues that sanction such actions and a growing number of Muslim civilians and noncombatants are being killed by their coreligionists , in Iraq , Afghanistan [ 2 ] , and elsewhere .
For these reasons , the argument that follows is more than merely hypothetical .
Western military commanders , politicians and philosophers who have sanctioned the widespread bombing of civilian populations –owing to the industrialization of war and its being wedded with nationalist ideology during the 19th and 20th centuries - realize that their actions involve a dangerous moral leap .
The following passage from Phillip Meilinger ’s work on the moral implications of modern warfare illustrates this point :
The Fall of France in 1940 left Britain alone against Germany .
The ensuing Battle of Britain , culminating in the Blitz , left England reeling .
Surrender was unthinkable , but it could not retaliate with its outnumbered and overstretched army and navy .
The only hope of hitting back at Germany and winning the war lay with Bomber Command .
But operational factors quickly demonstrated that prewar factors [ emphasizing precision bombing of military objectives ] had been hopelessly unrealistic .
… Aircrew survival dictated night area attacks , and , in truth , there was little alternative other than not to attack at all .
Moral constraints bowed to what was deemed military necessity , which led air leaders down a particularly slippery slope . [ 3 ]
That slippery slope led to wanton massacres of civilians that were unprecedented in history and they culminated in the nuclear incineration of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Muslims who would sanction gross violations of civilian immunity , owing to strategic desperation , are entering on a similarly slippery slope .
However , there is a huge difference between the norms that govern western strategic thinking and those defined by Islam .
Namely , western norms are socially constructed while those defined by Islam have their origin in revelation – the latter as understood by Muslims .
Hence , from a Muslim perspective , and that perspective is critical for the argument we are making , western norms are subject to change with changes in social , political , economic and especially technological considerations , while Islamic norms are transcendent . [ 4 ]
The idea of total war , which holds that there is no distinction between the combatant and noncombatant elements of an enemy population , and that both groups can legitimately be targeted by an armed force , is ancient .
The Peloponnesian War ( 431-404 BC ) , as documented by Thucydides , involved both the mobilization of entire populations for the war effort and likewise the eradication of entire populations , such as the inhabitants of Milos .
During the Middle Ages , the Mongol invasion of the Muslim heartland of Asia could be described as a campaign of total warfare that left unimaginable death and destruction in its wake .
The existence of total war campaigns during early historical periods is accompanied by efforts to extend immunity from violent conflicts to civilians .
Plato , various Roman philosophers , Medieval Christian theologians , orders of knights and in the early modern period , theorists such as Francisco de Victoria and Hugo Grotius all advocated various degrees of civilian immunity from the scourges of war .
In the western intellectual tradition , thinking surrounding this idea during various historical epochs was associated with prevailing views of just and unjust actions as well as the self - interest of relevant societal actors , as opposed to clear and deeply rooted scriptural pronouncements .
This was true even among Christians .
Hence , we do not see meaningful discussions on limiting the destructiveness of war among Christian theologians until the 4th Christian Century with the work of St. Augustine .
In Europe , changing conditions and circumstances have led to changing positions on the issue of civilian immunity .
For much of the latter Middle Age the prevailing European views were dominated by ideas emerging from the Catholic Church ’s Peace of God movement , and the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas .
The advent of the nation - state in the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 would introduce a new epistemology to govern thinking around strategic affairs , even though Medieval Christian thinking still informed attitudes and policies related to civilian immunity , at least until the French and Industrial Revolutions .
These nearly simultaneous developments led to the idea that the civilian infrastructure needed to support a modern war effort was so essential to its successful prosecution that it transformed civilians into combatants .
As a result , beginning with the Napoleonic Wars and the American Civil War , conflicts in the West would witness the erosion of civilian immunity –at least until the aftermath of the World War Two .
Unlike the situation prevailing in non-Muslim lands , the idea of civilian immunity among Muslims has been rooted in clear scriptural pronouncements from the prophetic epoch .
Qur’anic passages establishing the sanctity of innocent life ( Q. 5:32 ) and not expanding hostilities to noncombatants ( Q. 2:190 ) coupled with prophetic strictures against killing women , children , monks , and other noncombatants created the basis for a strong and enduring Muslim ethic governing civilian immunity .
Although there have clearly been instances when some Muslim rulers and commanders have not respected that ethic , it has generally remained a restraining factor throughout Muslim history . [ 5 ]
Among its greatest fruits has been the existence of large non-Muslim populations in historical Muslim empires , the general lack of forced conversion of non-Muslim populations , a lack of genocidal massacres undertaken by Muslim armies [ 6 ] , and the peaceful coexistence of Muslims and other faith communities in areas such as Andalusia , Bosnia , Palestine and Iraq , historically .
As changing geopolitical and technological realities dictate changes in the norms governing the intentional targeting of civilians in western strategic thinking , there is no inherent damage to the integrity of western secular thought .
Indeed , the socially constructed nature of those norms only serves to reinforce the secularity of the process whereby they are arrived at and the analytical methods governing their assessment .
This is not the case for the transcendental Islamic ideal governing civilian immunity .
When it is abandoned by Muslims , a critical aspect of the religion itself in abandoned .
As Dr. Tim Winter ( Abdul Hakim Murad ) [ 7 ] , expanding the work of John Gray [ 8 ] and others , argues , when that abandonment occurs in the modern context , it is precisely because the transcendental Islamic ideal has been forsaken or lost .
Muslims who target civilians are robbed of any moral high ground in their struggle with opposing forces and are left naked before the bitter winds of political expediency .
If expediency demands suicidal murder , bombs in mosques and marketplaces or in the heart of western cities then in the view of those who have entered upon this vile path , so be it .
At the heart of the Islamic ethic regarding the sanctity of innocent life is the following verse in the Qur’an , alluded to earlier :
Owing to that [ first instance murder ] we ordained for the Children of Israel that whosever takes an innocent life for other than retribution for murder or murderous sedition in the land it is as if he has killed all of humanity , and whoever saves a life it is as if he has saved all of humanity .
Our Messengers have come to them with clear proofs , yet even after that many of them exceed limits in the land .
[ 9 ] ( Q. 5:32 )
من أجل ذلك كتبنا على بني إسرائيل أنه من قتل نفسا بغي ر
نفس أو فساد في الأرض فكأنما قتل الناس جميعا و من أحياها فكأنما أحيا الناس جميعا و لقد جاءتهم رسلنا بالبينات ثم إن كثيرا منهم بعد ذلك في الأرض لمسرفو ن
This verse emphasizes that the immunity extended to innocents is a principle that was upheld by all of the Prophets .
Hence , the specific mention of the Children of Israel , who were the recipients of a long line of Prophets , and the mentioning of the Messengers at the end of the verse .
The idea that to discard the immunity that is extended to innocents is to abandon an indispensible part of the divine law is emphasized by Imam al - Qurtubi in his commentary on this verse ( Q. 5:32 ) .
He states :
The meaning is that whoever makes it lawful to take the life of a single innocent person has made everyone ’s life lawful , because he has rejected the divine law [ establishing the prohibition of killing innocents ] [ 10 ] .
المعنى أن من استحل واحدا فقد استحل الجميع لأنه أنكر الشر ع
Abandoning the divine law when one makes the blood of innocent people lawful to shed is emphasized from a deeper perspective by Imam Fakruddin al - Razi in his commentary on the same verse .
He states :
When he [ a murderer ] resolves to intentionally kill an innocent person he has given preference to the dictates of his bloodlust and anger over the dictates of obeying God .
When this prioritization occurs , in his heart he has resolved to kill anyone who opposes his demands , were he capable of doing so . [ 11 ]
أ نه لما أقدم على القتل العمد العدوان فقد رجح داعية الشهوة و الغضب على داعية الطاعة و متى كان الأمر كذلك كان هذاالترجيح حاصلا بالنسبة إلى كل واحد فكان في قلبه أن كل أحد نازعه من مطالبه فإنه لو قدر عليه لقتله
The murderous campaigns undertaken by some misguided Muslims that have led to the massacre of thousands of civilians in the Muslim world and that are now threatening the innocent people in this country are not manifestations of Jihad , as some claim .
Rather , they are a mirror image of the godless murderous mayhem and carnage this country has inflicted on the innocent civilians of many Muslim countries , and , as explained above , it involves an abandonment of the prophetic legacy .
Every Muslim who is concerned for the future of his or her faith and the future of the prophetic legacy in the world is morally obliged to work in whatever capacity he or she can to stop attacks that target innocent civilians by any party – Muslims or members of other communities .
The basis for this moral obligation is powerfully stated by Imam Razi in his commentary on ( 5:32 ) .
He mentions :
If all of humanity knew that a single individual intends to exterminate them they would undoubtedly try their utmost to prevent him from obtaining his objective .
Likewise , if they knew that he intends to kill a single person then their seriousness and exertion in trying to deter him from killing that person should be just as great as it would be in preventing their own mass murder . [ 12 ]
هو أن جميع الناس لو علموا من إنسان واحد أنه يقصد قتلهم بأجمعهم فلا شك أنهم يدفعونه دفعا لا يمكنه تحصيل مقصوده فكذلك إذا علموا منه أنه يقصد قتل إنسان واحد معين يجب أن يكون جدهم واجتهادهم في منعه عن قتل ذلك الإنسان مثل جدهم واجتهادهم في الصورة الأول ى
The reason for this is that the life of a single innocent person has the sanctity of the lives of all humanity .
This is an ideal we can not let die .
If we allow it to die who will revive it ?
Human history has shown how quickly we can begin a free fall into murderous madness once we have entered upon the path that justifies murdering innocent civilians and other noncombatants .
If the American military and the warmongering interests supporting it are guilty in this regard we condemn them in the strongest terms , and if our fellow Muslims are guilty we must likewise condemn them .
The only difference between the two cases is that when the American military kills innocent civilians it is violating principles of human rights and worldly conventions , which , as we have seen with the current arguments justifying torture , are subject to change or being discarded altogether .
When Muslims do it , we are betraying our faith and the legacy of the Prophets , peace upon them , who have left us a wealth of timeless , enduring wisdom .
Notes :
[ 1 ] I am not assuming that Faisal Shahzad , the Pakistani - American who has been arrested in association with this bomb plot is guilty .
The investigation is ongoing and his guilt has yet to be established .
The affair does provide an occasion to discuss the issues that are raised in this essay .
[ 2 ]
This statement does not discount the existence of black or psychological operations that are undertaken against Muslim civilians by the security apparatuses of Western powers at war in the Muslim world , along with their agents and surrogates .
However , it is undeniably true that an increasingly large number of the attacks against Muslim noncombatants are being undertaken by Muslims themselves .
[ 3 ] Quoted in Ward Thomas , The Ethics of Destruction : Norms and Force in International Relations ( Ithaca , London : Cornell University Press , 2001 ) , 90 .
[ 4 ]
The transcendental nature of Muslim norms does not deny the human effort that went into translating those norms into policy .
Hence , like their medieval Christian scholastic counterparts , Muslim theologians struggled to define the scope and limits of civilian immunity .
[ 5 ]
For an insightful study of the generally peaceful nature of Islam ’s spread among non-Muslim peoples , and its respect for them see Professor Thomas Arnold , The Spread of Islam in the World : A History of Peaceful Preaching ( New Delhi : Goodword Books , 2001 ) .
[ 6 ]
The most notable exception to this assertion is the Armenian Genocide that occurred in Ottoman Turkey in 1915 .
This controversial tragedy occurred during the waning years of a Muslim world governed by a viable Islamic tradition , and after Turkey had been transformed into a nationalist , quasi Islamic state led by the Young Turks .
By that time , the Sultan was a powerless figurehead .
For most of the Ottoman reign Armenians were a self - governing minority that enjoyed the protection of the rulers in Istanbul .
[ 7 ]
See Abdal - Hakim Murad , Bombing Without Moonlight : The Origins of Suicidal Terrorism ( Bristol , England : Amal Press , 2008 ) .
Murad convincingly demonstrates how Muslims who engage in wanton attacks against civilians are merely extensions of a deeply - rooted history of such violence in western civilization .
Likewise , he shows how Muslims who would justify such violence openly reject the Islamic tradition of patience and restraint in strategic affairs .
[ 8 ]
See John Gray , Al Qaeda and What It Means To Be Modern ( New York : The New Press , 2005 ) .
Gray argues that the philosophy of al Qaeda owes more to the positivism of Saint - Simon and Comte than to any traditional Islamic influences , and its organizational structure is a reflection of 21st Century globalization .
[ 9 ]
Their exceeding limits lies in the continuation of their murderous ways .

By Mohammad Fadel on May 14 , 2010 at 8:31 am
Salam alaikum : I read your column with great interest and sympathy , but I am curious about a couple of points which your column does not address that I think are highly relevant to this problem .
First , based on my studies of fiqh , the jurists did not recognize unqualified immunity for non-Muslim non-combatants , or even for Muslim non-combatants .
For example , they permitted Muslims to use medieval siege weapons even if their use would likely result in the death of non-combatants , so long as it was necessary for the campaign 's success and they did not target the non-combatants .
Moreover , the presence of Muslims among the enemy who could be killed as a result of resorting to such weapons did result in a categorical prohibition against their deployment in such circumstances .
Instead , it was again a matter of strategic calculus .
I do n't see how the logic of the fiqh then is that terribly different from that of modern international humanitarian law that permits the killing of non-combatants under certain circumstances , including when they are not intentionally targeted .
Second , you do not address the issue of Muslims who collaborate with " non-Muslim " invaders .
There are many fatwas that declare Muslims who collaborate with non-Muslim invaders to be either apostates , or legitimate targets of the Muslims who resist the invaders .
You might be interested in taking a look at a recent dissertation by Jocelyn Hendrickson , one chapter of which deals in detail with ' Abd al - Qadir 's resistance to the French , and the status of the Muslims who collaborated with them .
The terrorist groups claim that those who collaborate with the Americans are apostates as a result , and therefore , they have lost their immunity .
It seems to me that to refute this view one has to be able to say that the entire conceptual apparatus of this fiqh is obsolete and not applicable to today 's wars , but I do n't know of anyone who has gone that far .
Was -salam , Mohammad Fadel

I must say I have often disagreed with your articles on issues regarding conflicts between Muslims and non-Muslims in this day and age .
That being said , I take my metaphoric hat off to you for a really excellent article .
You have addressed the issue in a way that respects our sensibilities as Muslims towards the bloodbaths we are witnessing in the Muslim world whether they be carried out by Western armed forces or Muslims who have lost any hope and have fallen victim to desperation نسأل الله لنا ولكم السلامة والعافية .
The proves you have shown are quite clear .
One final note , it would be interesting to find a historical document which literally documents how war was understood by famous Muslim warriors like Salahu al - Din al - Ayyubi .
Again , thank you for the interesting reflection .
By Shaw on May 20 , 2010 at 1:24 pm
This article is interesting .
Its seems that the blame is still going on to the west .
As a Muslim I do n't understand why in Kabul the Taliban are killing their own kind .
Blowing up there who brothers and sisters .
The Umma fails to address this issue .
By Tehsin on May 27 , 2010 at 8:09 am
Assalamualaikum , I love reading the essays at the zaytuna 's site .. but sometimes it pains me that such learned scholars are so easily duped into this whole propaganda / carefully crafted deceit that muslims kill civilians , are terrorist etc etc .
Is there any proof that the alleged failed bombing at Times Square was by that Pakistani ?
Could he merely have been scapegoated like so many others , ie the Christmas Bomber etc etc ??
Do we simply believe just because America says so ?
Have you not seen the larger picture here my dear Sheikh ?
Its more justifications engineered to stay in the Af - Pak region and Iraq .
You know how many innocents are framed and killed daily ?
Why do n't you write for the hapless villagers who are bombed by drones daily and tarred as MILITANTS ?
You just make me want to cry in frustration that such learned muslims cannot see what fitna is going on ... even some non-muslims can see it ... try reading Anti-war.com ..try reading this : http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2010/05/09/has-faisal-shahzad-started-a-war/

" Hence , we do not see meaningful discussions on limiting the destructiveness of war among Christian theologians until the 4th Christian Century with the work of St. Augustine . "
Until 313 , Christianity was an illegal sect in the Roman empire .
They were not exactly in a position to make war .
In fact , at almost every turn ( even at the height of the Holy Roman Empire ) , Christians scholars were the greatest advocates for just war .
The moral equivalency just does not hold up to historical scrutiny .
Bartolome de las Casas , a Dominican friar was one of the main reasons that we know about the human rights abuses of imperial Spain in the new world .
Christianity has always taught the inviolable dignity of the human person , because God took on a human flesh ( Jesus , the 2nd person of the Holy Trinity ) .
The challenge is for Muslims to take up this challenge and see jewish people as just as important as Muslims ; because they are created in the Image and Likeness of God Almighty .

Andy Cohen waves his arm at the electrical miscellany hanging around him , showing off his tubular lugs and a box labeled “ 81 - piece terminal assortment ” .
Cohen is holding court at the back of the RadioShack store he owns in Sebastopol , California .
To his left , a tattooed kid fishes through a metal chest of drawers labeled “ fast - acting / slow - blow 3ag - type ” .
Another cabinet is labeled “ capacitors : electrolytic , radial ( pcb- mount ) leads , axial ( in - line ) leads ” .
Behind him , a spinning rack is hung with baggies containing dozens of different brass and gold solderless connectors .
They ’re the little widgets you think of when you think of RadioShack — the sort of electronic parts the company once had a near monopoly on but that are increasingly hard to find there .
Cohen gets much of his supply direct from China .
“ Where are you going to find all these different kinds of solder ?
A selection of five soldering irons ?
All these connectors ? ” Cohen says .
“ Other RadioShacks , they hide this stuff or do n’t buy enough of it anymore .
We go out of our way to show you these things . ”
Cohen is 54 , with a gruff voice and the intense , deep - set eyes of an older Joaquin Phoenix .
As a kid , he built computers , yammered on ham radios , and took special trips to the electronics shops in Lower Manhattan with his dad .
He also pored over the RadioShack catalog the day it arrived , studying up on what was then cutting - edge technology — reel - to - reel tape decks , fax machines — and the pages and pages of arcane electronic components .
Cohen bought this store in 2003 after 25 years as a project manager at companies like Hughes Aircraft and Hewlett - Packard .
Housed in a strip mall between a pet supply shop and a dry cleaner , it is not among RadioShack ’s 4,470 corporate - owned stores but one of about 1,400 franchised dealerships .
In exchange for using the RadioShack name , Cohen is required to buy a certain amount of his inventory from the company .
Otherwise , he has a lot of leeway .
And he has used it to fashion his shop into something like the eccentric , mad- scientist RadioShacks he grew up with .
But he knows that he ’s largely on his own in this , fighting a battle for the soul of the company that ’s pretty much been decided everywhere else .
Recently , RadioShack has been forcefully rebranding itself , trying to shed its image as a temple of transistors , parts , and cables .
Polished executives have parachuted in from the boardrooms of Safeway , Kmart , and Coca - Cola to turn the iconic American retailer around after years of underperformance and uncertainty .
( In 2007 , The Onion summed up the brand ’s decline with the satiric headline “ Even CEO Can’t Figure Out How Radioshack Still in Business . ” )
The plan ?
The new bosses want to turn RadioShack into a hipper , more mainstream place for “ mobility ” — which is what they insist on calling the cell phone market .
( In an interview , RadioShack ’s marketing chief used the word mobility an average of once every 105 seconds . )
Selling phones is central to the new RadioShack .
And so far , it seems to be working .
Per - store sales are up , and corporate profits jumped 26 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 .
Wall Street seems to like the strategy .
After Apple finally deigned to let the chain sell iPhones late last year , the same Morgan Stanley analyst who in 2008 had described RadioShack as “ a decaying business model ” lauded its “ growing relevancy as a wireless destination . ”
And in early March , the company ’s stock price was pumped up by unsubstantiated rumors that it might be taken over by an investment firm .
If nothing else , the gossip could suggest that RadioShack has whipped itself back into respectable - enough shape to be a plausible investment target .
But a small subculture of RadioShack nostalgics , including many former employees , have watched all this unfold with sorrow — if not a feeling of betrayal , then at least loss .
The last nails are being hammered into the coffin of the little electronics hobby shop they once loved .
And the cell phone seems to be an apt symbol for the superficiality and ordinariness they feel are taking its place .
“ You walk into a regular RadioShack and it ’s become like a neurosis , ” Cohen says .
“ ‘ Sir , can I sell you a cell phone today ?
How old is your cell phone ?
What about your family , do they have cell phones ? ' ”
The story of RadioShack ’s evolution over the past half century turns out to be the story of America ’s changing relationship with technology .
The RadioShacks of old catered to customers who could diagnose a busted TV on their basement workbench .
They might be messing around with some project on a Saturday afternoon , find that they were missing a part , and hustle out to the nearest RadioShack for some of the very gear Cohen still stocks .
But his shop is a lone outpost ; in a single generation , the American who built , repaired , and tinkered with technology has evolved into an entirely new species : the American who prefers to slip that technology out of his pocket and show off its killer apps .
Once , we were makers .
Now most of us are users .
“ We are not looking for the guy who wants to spend his entire paycheck on a sound system , ” RadioShack ’s chair , Charles Tandy , bragged to analysts in the mid-1970s .
“ We are in the do - it - yourself business . ”
Craftiness was in Tandy ’s bloodline .
He cut his teeth helming the family business , the Tandy Leather Company , which sold leather and leatherworking tools to veterans ’ hospitals and Boy Scouts .
The cigar - chomping Texan was the kind of eccentric , larger - than - life executive that any modern PR handler would keep tightly muzzled .
He celebrated his 60th birthday by riding a rented elephant around the grounds of his mansion , and he kept a plastic breast on his desk that made a gong sound when he pressed the nipple .
It was how he called for more coffee .
Tandy recognized that leatherworking was probably not a growth industry , and in 1963 he strong - armed his board of directors into buying and pouring money into RadioShack , then a 42 - year - old company with nine stores .
RadioShack quickly ballooned into a chain of more than 6,000 locations , becoming a kind of cluttered general store for the pioneers of the electronic age .
That growth was spurred on in the mid-’70s , when the company smartly got in front of one particular technological fad : the CB radio craze .
At the peak of the boom , RadioShack was opening three new stores a day .
( “ Americans sure like to jabber , ” a befuddled executive told the press . )
This is not to say Charles Tandy himself was an early adopter or technogical visionary .
According to the book Tandy ’s Money Machine , by Irvin Farman , when a RadioShack vice president rushed down to Tandy ’s departing Lincoln Continental to tell him they had created a promising prototype of a computer , Tandy shot back , “ A computer ?
Who needs a computer ? ”
Nevertheless , by 1977 , the company was preparing to unveil the TRS - 80 , the world ’s first mass - produced , fully assembled PC .
“ I remember the TRS - 80 very well , ” says Forrest Mims .
At the time , Mims had already begun his career writing how - to books like Getting Started in Electronics and Engineer ’s Notebook , definitive editions in the world of hobby electronics that have sold more than 2 million copies .
The books were written exclusively for RadioShack and were offered in stores for a few dollars each .
They were essentially giveaways ; the real money came from all the diodes , transistors , and tools that hobbyists needed to build the circuits he diagrammed .
It was a shrewd tactic .
Those little parts and pieces had huge markups — some as high as 500 percent — and RadioShack could fit lots of them in its relatively small stores .
Mims was invited to take a look at the TRS - 80 , before it went on sale , at a RadioShack R&D unit located in a warehouse in downtown Fort Worth .
The two young engineers who had developed the machine led him around .
“ They escorted me into this room , ” Mims recalls .
“ It was all hush - hush . ” Inside , arrayed on long tables , were two dozen TRS - 80s , with cassette decks for data storage and 12 - inch RCA monitors .
They were being tested , and each had an image on its screen of a waving American flag .
“ It was really a shock , ” Mims says .
He had never seen 24 computers in a room before ; in those days , if you wanted a personal computer , you pretty much had to build it yourself .
One of the engineers invited Mims to sit down and try out the TRS - 80 — just fool around on it a little .
He declined .
“ I did n’t have a clue how to use the thing , ” he says .
Mims was an expert engineer , but he did n’t know anything about the machine ’s programming language , Basic .
A new era was beginning .
Computers , and all consumer electronic goods , were on their way to becoming what they are today : slick low - cost commodities heaped in the aisles of big - box stores .
When they break , it ’s cheaper to throw them out than open them up and repair them , and most ca n’t be sold for the kind of profit margins required by small stores like RadioShack .
In retrospect , the launch of the TRS - 80 was probably the most promising moment in RadioShack ’s history — and the start of its decline .
“ Let ’s put it this way , ” Mims says .
“ Hobby electronics peaked with the advent of the ready - made PC .
There was no longer a need for anyone to build digital displays and TTL processors in their garage or spend time messing with circuitry .
Now you could spend time at a keyboard , working on an actual computer . ”
It was a fulfillment of a dream .
But it also served as a portent that the hands - on way of life RadioShack embodied would become irrelevant .
Mims could n’t use the TRS - 80 that day because he knew much more about how that piece of technology was wired on the inside than how to do anything with it .
In other words , he was the exact opposite of today ’s typical consumer .
And that cultural shift is what RadioShack has been struggling with ever since .
The TRS - 80 may have signaled the arrival of modern consumer electronics , but that revolution largely failed to transform RadioShack .
The company , with its roots stuck deep in the DIY business , sold electronic products under the Tandy and Realistic brands , but they suffered in comparison with brands like Sony and Panasonic .
Now the company is trying to engineer a dramatic change of course .
Last August , it launched a $ 200 million “ brand transformation ” effort — not changing its name , exactly , but instead asking America to call it by a nickname : the Shack .
The company ran bizarre animated television spots .
In one , a gaggle of Albert Einsteins scampered into a dump truck ; in another , cell phones in Nordic attire sang in the native tongue of “ Phonelandia . ”
( The message : “ The Shack sells more phones than the population of Scandinavia . ” )
An outdoor party called the Summer Netogether was held simultaneously in San Francisco and New York City in front of two 17 - foot laptop mock - ups and streamed live on the Web .
But as the hours crawled on , the event started to feel like a painfully long red-carpet party with no main event to follow .
At one point , there was a dance contest .
One entrant whipped off his prosthetic leg and air - guitared with it .
Chief marketing officer ` says the aim has been to make RadioShack synonymous with mobile phones and “ unwind decades of brand misconception . ”
The problem , in short , was that Americans did n’t think RadioShack was cool .
To the extent that most people thought about RadioShack at all , it was as a convenient place to grab some printer ink or a hearing - aid battery .
Between 2004 and 2009 , the company ’s profits fell by 39 percent .
It had gotten to the point where , early last year , executives were putting a little too much hope on the nationwide switch - over to digital TV , imagining that folks coming in to buy conversion boxes could be seduced into other , more expensive purchases , too .
But the little old ladies with coupons for government - subsidized antennas were resistant to impulse buys .
Still , where giant specialty retailers like the Good Guys and Circuit City rode the electronics boom and bust right into bankruptcy , RadioShack has survived , although that survival was less a matter of salesmanship than cost-cutting .
Around the time new CEO Julian Day took over in 2006 , the company liquidated poorly selling inventory , closed 481 stores , and squeezed $ 100 million out of administrative expenses ; even the houseplants in RadioShack stores were sold — to employees for $ 5 each — to save on the cost of watering them .
One of Day ’s other priorities has been to meticulously homogenize RadioShack stores , á la McDonald ’s and Starbucks .
Whereas the company once gave store managers an astounding amount of autonomy , a recently distributed internal handbook provides precise instructions for everything from organizing merchandise on the show floor to which cleaning fluid they must use to shine their metallic lower shelves .
( Armor All Original formula , if you ’re wondering . )
Another page presents , with a series of painstakingly annotated photographs , the head - to - toe elements of the only two acceptable styles of dress for salespeople : Traditional Business ( tie , optional vest or blazer , light - colored shirt , dress shoes ) and RadioShack Casual ( black , white , or red shirt , no tie , dress loafers ) .
Day ’s efforts have made the company look better on paper , but it was only when it began to sell itself as a place to comparison - shop for wireless phones and calling plans that RadioShack began to seem viable again .
It may seem strange that , finding themselves in a financial morass , executives decided their best option was to compete head - to - head with both the wireless carriers ’ own stores and the cell phone departments of giants like Walmart and Best Buy .
But they may have had little choice :
The average RadioShack store is only 2,500 square feet and can’t possibly stock a competitive selection of large appliances like flatscreen TVs .
( Managers have had to stash merchandise in the rafters or rent off - site storage units in the run-up to Christmas . )
Cell phones , on the other hand , like the parts and pieces the company once thrived on , are small products with exceptionally high profit margins .
There ’s the handset and the accessories , but most important , there ’s the commission that wireless carriers pay to cell phone retailers for every new contract on a phone .
A phone is like a tiny slot machine that pays off month after month .
The logic is hard to resist , and in fact , RadioShack ’s focus on wireless has been building gradually for at least the past decade — always at the direct expense of hobbyists , says Tim Oldham , a former corporate buyer at the company .
“ They intentionally decided to downsize the product offering for hobbyists , all the capacitors and resistors and connectors , ” in order to cram in more phones , Oldham says .
“ It ’s not coincidental .
The money was just too big . ”
Applbaum says he does n’t want to “ disenfranchise ” hobbyists , but his job is to bust RadioShack out of that niche and reintroduce it to people as a competitive , mainstream retailer of consumer electronics .
Especially mobility .
Applbaum wants to send a message : “ The RadioShack of yesterday … is not the RadioShack of today . ”
Andy Cohen is not an unreasonable man .
He ’s willing to admit — begrudgingly — that he does n’t totally disagree with what RadioShack is doing .
“ As a stockholder at a lot of other companies , I look at what Julian Day is doing and I think , actually , that looks like the right thing to do . ”
His shop is an anomaly , Cohen says — a product of its idiosyncratic community .
He does n’t pretend it ’s some kind of concept store RadioShack ought to roll out nationwide .
Cohen takes pride in the fact that his store carries only a single model of cell phone : a bulbous white handset called the Jitterbug .
It has no features to speak of — it ’s basically the mom jeans of mobility .
Cohen and his store manager , Steven Muscarelli , have made the centerpiece of their shop something they call the Make Case .
Make magazine , the quirky bible of the DIY community , happens to be headquartered down the street , and in a glass showcase right under the register , Cohen and Muscarelli have an exhibit of back issues , tools , printed circuit boards , kits , and a slew of components to screw around with : ultrasonic range finders , dual - axis accelerometers , microbots .
( There are also a bunch of Star Wars action figures in the Make Case , just because . )
Muscarelli says people will come in , pick up an issue of Make , buy all the stuff they ’ll need to build a particular project or hack outlined in the magazine — like a TV - B - Gone or a USB device charger made from an Altoids box — then head off to their garages .
“ They come back in later and say , ‘ Look what I made ! ' ”
But elsewhere , it ’s a grim time for old RadioShack diehards .
Mike D’Alessio , a once - devoted customer in Illinois who grew up playing with crystal radios and electronics kits he bought at his local RadioShack , tells me , “ We ’re living in a disposable world .
It ’s just not worth it to repair things ; it ’s not worth it to build things from scratch .
The magic of that seems to have passed . ”
For reasons he can’t fully articulate , D’Alessio felt moved to scan 67 years ’ worth of old RadioShack catalogs , page by page , and post them online .
He often gets grateful emails from wistful or disenfranchised former customers and employees .
“ Some people say RadioShack is just a store , ” D’Alessio says .
“ But to me it was an idea — a learning and resource center that really shaped people ’s lives . ”
D’Alessio has started talking about the company in the past tense .

The Department of Foreign Affairs advised people to reconsider travel to anywhere in Thailand because of '' widening political unrest and civil disorder occurring in Bangkok and other parts of the country ' ' .
Australia 's embassy will not open today after gun battles raged on the street outside over the past two days .
Soldiers have strung razor wire across Sathorn Road , close to the embassy , while protesters burned telephone boxes , tyres and car parts outside the embassy .
Thai media have reported two protesters were shot by snipers in a closed service station next door to the Australian mission .
As the army slowly strangled the Red Shirts ' central city protest site yesterday , they declared two parts of the city , at Din Daeng and Bon Kai , live - fire zones .
Senior generals have threatened that anybody walking into those zones will be shot on sight .
In response , the Red Shirts sought to gain whatever extra territory they could across the city , hastily constructing new barricades made from tyres and car parts , and where threatened , setting them on fire .
Several houses were also burned , and there were reports closed businesses and buildings in the no-man 's land between the Red Shirts and the army were being attacked .
The army has not yet taken any territory from the Red Shirts , but having strangled the protesters ' supply of food and water , and cut off power and communications to their camp , they are preparing for a final , violent , push to remove them .
The Red Shirts have been on the streets since March 12 , and have occupied the city 's shopping and finance districts for more than a month .
An army spokesman , Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd , said a temple within the Red Shirt zone has been set up as a meeting place for people who wished to leave .
But yesterday , save for a small group of elderly women and some children , the offer was largely ignored .
The army said it planned to allow neutral organisations , such as the Red Cross , into the protest area to encourage demonstrators to leave .
Late yesterday , some Red Shirt leaders indicated they would be prepared to return to the negotiating table , but only if troops were immediately withdrawn from the streets and the UN brought in to broker peace .
" We want the UN to moderate it because we do not trust anyone else .
There is no group in Thailand that is neutral enough , " Reds co-leader Nattawut Saikua said .
But the government appeared determined to continue with its plan to remove the protesters .
" If they really want to talk , they should not set conditions like asking us to withdraw troops , " Korbsak Sabhavasu , the Prime Minister 's secretary - general , said .
The announcement of the curfew brought a wave of anger from demonstrators , but the army later backed down on the proposal , saying it was unnecessary .
A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said any Australian in Bangkok in need of urgent assistance should contact the embassy by phone .

Earlier this week , we noted that the major parties in the European Parliament had all agreed on a resolution trashing the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) and the secret process that has been hashing it out .
That resolution has passed Parliament by a huge margin — 633 yes votes , 13 no votes , and 16 abstentions .
The Greens / EFA coalition praised the vote .
Greens MEP Carl Schlyter of Sweden said that " ACTA risks becoming known as the Absence of Commission Transparency Agreement ...
The EU cannot continue to negotiate on ACTA if the people are not allowed to take part in the process .
It is also a totally absurd and unacceptable situation if MEPs , behind closed doors , have to ask the Commission about the content of the agreements we are supposed to vote on . "
A happy Engström
Christian Engström , the lone Pirate Party rep in Parliament , summed up the vote as an " epic win " that showed " the European Parliament is not a doormat . "
The resolution demanded complete access to the ACTA negotiating texts , and it threatens a lawsuit if the European Commission fails to turn them over .
Parliament was particularly miffed that the process has taken place in such secrecy , when major international IP treaties have in fact been negotiated much more openly at venues like WIPO and the WTO .
The resolution does n't call for an end to ACTA , but instead a limit to the core principles of counterfeiting and piracy — broad new enforcement measures like Internet disconnection should not be a part of it .
The Commission speaks
The EU Commissioner for Trade , Karel de Gucht , tried to head off the vote this week by telling Parliament that he heard their concerns .
" The Commission is in favour of releasing the negotiating documents as soon as possible , " he said .
" However , a few ACTA negotiating parties remain opposed to an early release .
I strongly disagree with their approach , but I can not unilaterally breach a confidentiality commitment .
My credibility as a negotiator is at stake .
Nevertheless , I will see to it that at the next negotiating round , in April , the Commission will vigorously push its negotiating partners to agree to release the text and I will raise European Parliament concerns bilaterally with ACTA parties like the US I am scheduled to meet before then . "
He also offered more detailed briefings with any MEP who wants one , and he pledged that " three strikes " would stay out of the deal .
" I am aware of the concerns expressed by some of you about the introduction of a compulsory ' three strikes rule ' or a ' graduated response ' system to fight copyright infringements and Internet piracy , " he said .
" Let me be very clear on this , so there is no room for ambiguity ...
The EU does not support and will not accept that ACTA creates an obligation to disconnect people from the internet because of illegal downloads . "
As we have reported , the current ( leaked ) ACTA draft would require that ISPs have some policy in place to " address the unauthorized storage or transmission of materials protected by copyright . "
A footnote provides a single example of such a policy : " providing for termination in appropriate circumstances of subscriptions and accounts in the service provider 's system or network of repeat infringers . "
Internet disconnection is n't mandatory , but it is currently encouraged by ACTA .
Obama on ACTA
As Europe 's politicians were calling for transparency and limitations , President Obama went to the US Export - Import Bank and made a speech in which he praised ACTA .
Yes , it was mentioned only once , but the treaty was picked out by name , and without qualification .
" What ’s more , we ’re going to aggressively protect our intellectual property .
Our single greatest asset is the innovation and the ingenuity and creativity of the American people , " said Obama .
" That ’s why USTR is using the full arsenal of tools available to crack down on practices that blatantly harm our businesses , and that includes negotiating proper protections and enforcing our existing agreements , and moving forward on new agreements , including the proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement . "
An Ann Arbor elementary school principal used a letter home to parents tonight to defend a field trip for black students as part of his school ’s efforts to close the achievement gap between white and black students .
Dicken Elementary School Principal Mike Madison wrote the letter to parents following several days of controversy at the school after a field trip last week in which black students got to hear a rocket scientist .
Principal Mike Madison is shown at Forsythe in this 2005 file photo . Â
“ In hindsight , this field trip could have been approached and arranged in a better way , " Madison wrote .
" But as I reflect upon the look of excitement , enthusiasm and energy that I saw in these children ’s eyes as they stood in the presence of a renowned African American rocket scientist in a very successful position , it gave the kids an opportunity to see this type of achievement is possible for even them .
“ It was not a wasted venture for I know one day they might want to aspire to be the first astronaut or scientist standing on the Planet Mars .
“ I also think it ’s important that you know that I have talked to the children who did not go on the field trip , and I think they have a better understanding of the purpose of the AA Lunch Bunch now , as I hope you do .
Â
I ’m sorry if any kids were upset by the field trip or my discussion afterwards with them , and I have let them know that .
“ The intent of our field trip was not to segregate or exclude students as has been reported , but rather to address the societal issues , roadblocks and challenges that our African American children will face as they pursue a successful academic education here in our community . ”
A handful of parents have complained to district administrators about the trip , the group and Madison .
More than a half - dozen parents contacted AnnArbor.com to raise the complaints , but none would agree to talk on the record , citing concerns of reprisals to their children by Madison .
While there ’s no clear agreement between the two sides about exactly what happened , most of the controversy centers on a field trip taken last week by the Lunch Bunch for African American boys and girls to hear a black rocket engineer talk .
District spokeswoman Liz Margolis said after the trip was over , those who went returned to their fifth - grade class and were greeted by boos by those who did n’t go on the trip .
Margolis said Madison , who is black , heard the boos , and went to talk to the class .
She said he and the class had a “ discussion ” about race issues .
“ He was n’t yelling at them .
He was very passionate about it , ” Margolis said .
Parents have complained he was yelling at the class and belittled a Muslim girl who said she also had experienced racism and discrimination .
The program itself began earlier this year after the school received its latest achievement results .
Margolis said the Lunch Bunch came from the school ’s School Improvement Team and is tied to that team ’s goals .
She said several other schools in the district have similar programs targeting specific subgroups of students who are at risk .
According to meeting minutes , Madison introduced the club to the PTO in February as part of the school and district ’s equity work .
Parent Vicki Haviland , who is white and has three children at Dicken , said she is supportive of the overall program .
Haviland is the secretary of the Dicken PTO and has filed papers for the open school board seat .
“ I think the African - American Lunch Bunch is totally in line with the district ’s equity work , ” she said .
“ I think the field trip was a fine idea . ”
She said she hopes the school and the district would “ do a better job in talking about ( race in education ) .
Clearly there are people who do n’t feel heard about it . ”

California State University lost 10 % of its teaching force in the last year , a result of crippling budget cuts that reduced job opportunities on many campuses , according to a faculty union group .
Numbers released by the California Faculty Assn. found that about 2,500 fewer faculty members were employed on the university ’s 23 campuses in May 2010 than in May 2009 .
The figures are based on payroll data and include full - and part - time faculty , coaches , counselors and others .
The numbers represent a loss of about 1,230 full - time equivalent faculty positions .
“ This is a horrific one - year drop in the number of faculty teaching our students , ” said the group ’s president , Lillian Taiz , a history professor at Cal State L.A .
“ These budget cuts are job killers for university faculty and staff , and they are opportunity killers for our students . ”
Job losses varied by campus .
Faculty numbers at Cal State Monterey Bay and the California Maritime Academy increased over the year , while the teacher count at Cal State Long Beach decreased by 237 , an 11 % drop .
At Cal State Dominguez Hills , the number of faculty members dropped from 702 to 601 , according to the group .
But campus spokeswoman Amy Bentley - Smith said the figure did not reflect recent hires for the spring semester .
The faculty union numbers roughly match those calculated by the Cal State system , said spokesman Erik Fallis .
The vast majority of job losses were of lecturers who work on a contract basis and are especially vulnerable to the budget ax .
State funding for Cal Sate was cut by $ 625 million over the last two years , resulting in student fee hikes , course reductions , enrollment cuts and employee furloughs .
Campuses were able to restore 4,000 course sections this spring and hope to add 8,000 more in the fall with money freed up from the receipt of one - time federal stimulus dollars , Fallis said .

Listen to Jonathan Schell and Tom Engelhardt discuss America ’s nuclear trajectory and the dilemma of nuclear weaponry in the Obama era .
Ad Policy
What is the purpose , if any , of the nuclear bomb , that brooding presence that has shadowed all human life for sixty - five years ?
The question has haunted the nuclear age .
It may be that no satisfactory answer has ever been given .
Nuclear strategic thinking , in particular , has disappointed .
Many of its pioneers have wound up in a state of something like despair regarding their art .
For example , Bernard Brodie , one of the originators of nuclear strategy in the 1940s , was forced near the end of his life to realize that " nuclear strategy itself –the body of thoughts that he himself had helped formulate –was something of an illusion , " according to historian Fred Kaplan .
In the introduction to The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy , Lawrence Freedman airs the suspicion that the phrase " nuclear strategy " may be a " contradiction in terms . "
Henry Kissinger , a leading figure in nuclear strategizing for a half - century , has expressed a similar feeling of futility .
In a remarkable reconsideration , amounting to an oblique recantation of his past thinking , he has written recently in Newsweek : Related Article America ’s Nuclear Trajectory TomDispatch
The basic dilemma of the nuclear age has been with us since Hiroshima : how to bring the destructiveness of modern weapons into some moral or political relationship with the objectives that are being pursued .
Any use of nuclear weapons is certain to involve a level of casualties and devastation out of proportion to foreseeable foreign - policy objectives .
Efforts to develop a more nuanced application have never succeeded , from the doctrine of a geographically limited nuclear war in the 1950s and 1960s to the " mutual assured destruction " theory of general nuclear war in the 1970s .
Now a new moment , full of fresh promise but also with novel perils , has arrived in the nuclear story , and all the old questions have to be asked again .
As if responding to some secret signal sent out by a restless zeitgeist , the globe is seething with events large and small in the nuclear arena .
Here in the United States , certainly , all the policy pots on the nuclear stove are at a boil .
Soon , the Obama administration will complete its overdue Nuclear Posture Review , a statement that Congress requires of the president every four years on the disposition of the country ’s nuclear forces .
It will give the administration ’s answer to the key questions :
What nuclear forces should the United States deploy ?
Why ?
What , if anything , does the United States propose to do with them ?
On April 8 the United States and Russia will sign a new Strategic Arms Reduction Talks ( START ) agreement , which will reduce warheads to 1,550 on each side and restrict delivery vehicles to 800 apiece .
Also in early April , President Obama will hold a Nuclear Security Summit with the heads of state of forty - four other nations to consider measures to prevent the diversion of nuclear weapon materials into unauthorized hands .
In early May will come the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference , which is a kind of nuclear posture review for the entire world .
Decisions on passage of the long - rejected Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as well as a resurrected Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty are also likely very soon .
The key question , of course , is whether the policies and actions will meet the mounting perils of the new situation .
What ’s needed for success , I will suggest , is a revival precisely of the discredited art of nuclear strategic thinking , which may , with suitable adjustments , yet have something to offer us .
Strategy , military thinkers have long told us , is the art of marrying up tactical means with broad political ends .
That is exactly what is most sorely missing in nuclear policy today .
Certainly , no mere piecemeal examination will suffice .
A comprehensive approach is needed .
The Nuclear Surge
For taken together , the dangers mark the world ’s arrival at a new stage in the evolution of nuclear danger , forcing fundamental decisions on nuclear and nonnuclear powers alike .
In a word , the nuclear predicament is coming of age , which is to say that it is fulfilling a potential that every competent scientist has known it possessed since the advent of the bomb in 1945 : nuclear technology , no longer the preserve of a few privileged powers , is becoming available on a global basis .
This is because of the simple but decisive fact that the bomb is based on scientific knowledge , which is in its nature unconfinable .
This spread is at the heart of the growing nuclear peril–a kind of nuclear surge–in today ’s world .
To say that the technology is becoming available to all , however , is not to say that it is possessed by all or even that it will be .
It means only that if nations or others want it , they will be able to have it .
Japan , for example , does not have a nuclear bomb .
But one is available to Japan in short order if it so chooses .
According to the State Department , the bomb is thus available to some fifty other countries .
This number of potential nuclear powers is destined to grow .
If those countries do not build the bomb , the reason can only be a domestic and international political decision that they should not .
The more this availability spreads ( as it must ) , the higher and stronger the political barriers against proliferation must become .
Of course , at a certain point , which may not be far off , availability , if not possession , will spill beyond national confines and reach smaller groups .
At that point the political walls will have to be high and strong indeed .
Otherwise , a nuclear 9/11 may be upon us .
Obviously , any deliberate spread of nuclear technology , such as the " renaissance " of nuclear power that has apparently begun , will only accelerate the surge .
This underlying and irreversible pressure of availability is the backdrop for today ’s widespread and well - founded dread that proliferation by just a few countries–above all , North Korea and Iran–will push the world over what the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament , a group set up by the Japanese and Australian governments , calls a " tipping point , " precipitating a " cascade " of proliferation that will wash away the current nuclear order .
South Asia has of course already gone nuclear , with India and Pakistan engaged in an arms race .
India , aping the United States , has planned a triad of air , land and sea nuclear forces while impoverished , crisis - ridden Pakistan struggles to keep up .
The Middle East and East Asia , led by Iran and North Korea , could become the next regions to travel down this path .
According to the Washington Post , A.Q. Khan , the " father " of Pakistan ’s bomb and the arch - proliferator of its nuclear technology , has said that Iranian officials asked him in the 1980s to sell them ready - made bombs .
Since then Iran has appeared to many to be using its right to develop nuclear power technology as a pathway to building the bomb from scratch .
If it does , other countries in the Middle East may well follow suit .
More immediately , Iran and nuclear - armed Israel would find themselves in a perilous balance–or rather , extreme imbalance , since Israel already has an undeclared arsenal of perhaps 200 warheads .
If North Korea , which already has the bomb , refuses , as seems likely , to give it up under pressure from the world community , then something similar could happen in East Asia , and Japan might indeed produce its own bomb .
And yet if it ’s tempting to some in the United States and elsewhere to define the new nuclear moment solely as a crisis of proliferation , they should be brought up short by a single brute fact : more than 95 percent of the world ’s 23,000 or so nuclear warheads remain in the possession of two countries : the United States , with some 9,000 , and Russia , with some 13,000 .
If one ineluctable truth of Year 65 of the bomb is that the sources of nuclear danger are destined to be global , another is that the world ’s existing arsenals are likewise indivisibly global .
They are joined in a kind of unity of hostility .
Each nuclear nation ( Israel , which has no nuclear adversary , may be the odd man out ) cites the arsenal of another or others as the rationale for possessing its own , in multiple chains that link them together into a network of threats and counterthreats .
For example , in one such chain , Pakistan fears India , which fears China , which fears Russia , which fears the United States .
This network of terror and counterterror underscores another truth of the nuclear age : every possessor of the bomb , by its very existence , teaches possible proliferators a pair of lessons that are the prime ( if not the only ) motives for proliferation .
First , you will be living in a nuclear - armed world ; second , if you want to be protected in that world you must have nuclear arms yourself .
( In addition , it has of course occurred to many countries , especially North Korea and Iran , that nuclear weapons could deter overwhelming conventional power such as that possessed by the United States . )
From national points of view , each arsenal is distinct , but from a global proliferation point of view they are a joint inducement for the further spread of nuclear arms .
The necessary conclusion is clear : proliferation ca n’t be stopped unless possession is dealt with concurrently .
In the seventh decade of the nuclear age , the time for half - solutions is over .
The head of state with his finger on the button of some aging cold war arsenal , the head of state itching to put his finger on such a button , the nuclear power operator , the nuclear smuggler and the terrorist in his hideout dreaming of unparalleled mass murder are actors on a single playing field .
In this respect , too , the nuclear dilemma has become indivisibly global .
This is a truth , however , that the world ’s nine nuclear powers do not like to acknowledge , because it has an implication they are reluctant to accept , which is that if they want to be safe from nuclear danger they must commit themselves to surrendering their own nuclear arms .
Strategic Incoherence
And yet that is exactly what Barack Obama did in his speech in Prague on April 5 , 2009 , saying , " So today , I state clearly and with conviction America ’s commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons . "
Encouragingly , his commitment has been accompanied by the widest support for nuclear abolition since President Harry Truman sent Bernard Baruch to ask the world in 1946 to choose between " the quick and the dead . "
For one thing , a remarkable phalanx of former and current officials , Republican as well as Democratic , have embraced the goal .
Their calls originated with the by - now - famous article by the " Gang of Four " –former Secretary of State George Shultz , former Secretary of Defense William Perry , former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Senator Sam Nunn–who in a January 2007 Wall Street Journal article announced their support for " a world free of nuclear weapons " and called for " working energetically on the actions required to achieve that goal . "
This unlikely foursome harked back to the previously underappreciated fact that Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev , at their summit in Reykjavik , Iceland , in 1986 , had come within an ace of agreeing to nuclear abolition .
( The deal foundered because Gorbachev would agree to it only if Reagan dropped his Strategic Defense Initiative , and Reagan would not . )
Today , a majority of former secretaries of state and defense support a world free of nuclear weapons .
A remarkable number of new government and civil panels , commissions and other initiatives have also sprung up to support the goal .
Among them is a new group , Global Zero , which proposes abolition by 2030 and is supported by a Who ’s Who of international as well as American signatories , including , for example , Gorbachev , Jimmy Carter and former GOP Senator Chuck Hagel .
The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , the Henry L. Stimson Center and the Nuclear Threat Initiative all have serious , well - funded programs to scout the path to zero and determine what would be required to stay there .
Meanwhile , the traditional antinuclear movement , led by such groups as Peace Action , the American Friends Service Committee and the Lawyers ’ Committee on Nuclear Policy , are marshaling support for a nuclear weapons convention .
If Obama ’s commitment to abolition and the movement in support of it were setting the tone and agenda of current nuclear negotiations , the world might now be in the first stage of a final solution ( to give that dread phrase a new and positive meaning ) of the nuclear dilemma .
Each proposal in the negotiations would be weighed in the light of the distance it traveled toward a nuclear - weapons - free world .
Unfortunately , that has not been the case .
Instead , what have been offered are at best a series of timid makeshifts or , at worst , de facto subversion of the Prague objective .
If this trend continues , it is entirely possible that the ultimate mockery will occur : nuclear arsenals will march forward into the future under a banner that reads Ban the Bomb .
Let us consider two policy arenas : the START agreement and the Nuclear Posture Review .
Nothing on the nuclear stage today is stranger or less adequately explained than the spectacle , still on view twenty years after the end of the cold war , of the United States and Russia holding each other hostage to nuclear annihilation with arsenals in the thousands poised on alert .
The current agreement , which will remain in force until 2020 , sets a ceiling of 1,550 warheads on each side that must be reached by 2017 .
The reduction from the old ceiling of 2,200 is of course welcome .
The continuation of a system of inspections is even more welcome .
But what are we to make of the 1,550 warheads that remain ?
After all , the limit on the 1,550 is also a permission for the 1,550 .
The arrangement indefinitely leaves intact the essential fact that the United States and Russia are poised to blow each other up many times over , as if the cold war had never ended .
What is that about ?
If strategy is the art of using tactics to achieve political ends , then the persistence of these arsenals represents its nemesis .
What political purpose is served ?
There is no quarrel between the two nations that would justify deployment of even a single nuclear weapon .
An answer is often made that the United States must have such an arsenal because Russia still does–as a " deterrent . "
But this begs the question .
For today , as in the past forty years , since the beginning of arms control agreements in 1972 , the size of the US arsenal has of course been a negotiated figure .
The question is not , as is sometimes pretended , whether in the face of a Russian threat the United States needs to protect itself and size its forces accordingly ; it is what figure the two sides should jointly set in talks like the ones just concluded .
What stopped Hillary Clinton when she went to Moscow from proposing a force on each side of , say , 300 weapons , as has been suggested by a prominent Air Force officer and two Air University professors recently in Strategic Studies Quarterly ?
For that matter , why not zero ?
That step admittedly would require bringing the other nuclear powers into the talks .
But why not do that –or at least set a time frame for doing so , thereby explicitly linking the current agreement to the president ’s announced goal ?
It is here that the strategic deficit becomes most glaring .
It ’s not just that tactics have lost contact with political goals , it is that nuclear tactics ( in this case , deployments ) are weighed without any reference to politics whatsoever .
Admittedly , the possibility of Russia backsliding into hostilities with the United States is sometimes cited as a reason for strategic " hedging , " but the obvious next question is whether the United States would prefer to be in a nuclear confrontation with a backslid Russia or in a merely conventional confrontation .
Has Washington decided that in case of any hostilities nuclear confrontations are preferable to nonnuclear ones ?
Behind this issue looms a larger unasked strategic question .
Are nations in general safer when they aim nuclear weapons at one another ( " deter " one another ) ?
Are some pairs safer and others not ?
Which ones ?
For example , do Americans think India and Pakistan were wise in 1998 to jointly go nuclear and threaten each other with annihilation ?
Are they safer today for having taken that step ?
The refusal of the United States and Russia to show the way by denuclearizing their own relationship is an answer that speaks louder than the Prague commitment and undercuts it .
That refusal says that nuclear weapons are useful and do make you safer .
But this lesson cuts the legs out from under any serious nonproliferation effort .
Was n’t the need for nonproliferation where we began ?
Is n’t that now the main professed goal of the United States in the nuclear field ?
Here is strategic incoherence in its acutest form .
Deployments to meet a vanished threat spoil any effort to deal with a current real one .
What we have heard so far of the Nuclear Posture Review exemplifies the same intellectual debacle .
Reportedly , the document will reject the proposal for " no first use . "
No first use is the policy of using nuclear weapons only in retaliation for nuclear attacks .
All other attacks , including ones with biological or chemical weapons , would be met by conventional forces .
The rejection of no first use would crystallize , as perhaps nothing else can , the strategic disarray of American nuclear policy .
Like the persistence of the forces of mutual assured destruction , it would represent the banishment of politics from strategy ( meaning in fact that strategy no longer is strategy ) .
The first - use policy was born in the 1950s , when US leaders believed they could deter perceived Soviet conventional superiority in Europe only by threatening a nuclear response .
Is it really necessary to state once again that the cold war is over ?
Apparently it is , because in this arena , too , news of the geopolitical revolution of 1989 - 91 has yet to reach the American strategic brain .
There , " extended deterrence " seems to be permanently planted on the basis of a kind of incurable nostalgia for the cold war .
Fantastically , surreally , the United States is still using nuclear arms to repel a Russian conventional attack on Europe , as if it were 1958 .
( We might as well say " Soviet attack , " since the threat is imaginary . )
This obsolete readiness is symbolically embodied in the deployment even today of some 200 American tactical nuclear warheads in Europe , ready at a moment ’s notice to repel Soviet hordes coming through the Fulda Gap .
In February , five of the European countries thus " defended " ( Belgium , Germany , the Netherlands , Luxembourg and Norway ) recommended that the weapons be withdrawn .
Washington is still thinking about it .
More important for today ’s concerns is that a no - first - use policy is the sine qua non of any effective nonproliferation strategy .
If nuclear weapons are needed not only to counter other nuclear weapons but to repel conventional , chemical and biological attacks as well , then what responsible national leader can afford to do without them ?
The problem is not merely symbolic .
If the nine nuclear powers are ready to use their arms to perform a grab bag of tasks , then the dangers to nonnuclear countries really do multiply , perhaps inspiring them to acquire these devices , evidently so versatile and useful , for themselves .
Toward a New Nuclear Strategy
To escape from this scene of halfhearted and ineffectual measures serving unclear or contradictory goals , the United States needs new strategic thinking .
In exploring what it should be , perhaps it will be useful to look back at past strategic thought .
The great intellectual artifact of cold war strategy was the doctrine of nuclear deterrence .
It adopted a new aim for military deployments .
In the renowned words of Bernard Brodie in 1946 , " Thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars .
From now on its chief purpose must be to avert them .
It can have almost no other useful purpose . "
This insight , which was recognized as a basis of policy in the early 1960s by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , marked a true revolution in military affairs .
Broadly speaking , war - fighting strategies were replaced by war - not - fighting strategies .
Not to fight , according to this policy , was to win .
And yet under this policy the way not to fight was nevertheless to plan to fight .
The trick was to restrict the plan for fighting to nuclear retaliation , in the hope that that day would never come .
Thus was born the paradoxical , or contradictory , policy on which survival in the nuclear age was believed to rest .
Safety from nuclear destruction depended not on getting rid of the arms that threatened it but on threats to inflict that same nuclear destruction .
In retrospect , it seems the doctrine of deterrence has been a true Janus : it has been based on one thoroughgoing absurdity and one profound truth .
The absurdity was the idea that you could lastingly and reliably avoid an action–mutual suicide in a nuclear war–by threatening the action .
The problem , as many critics noted , was that at any given moment–but especially in a crisis–you did not know whether you would get the nuclear non-use that was the new strategic goal or the use whose threat was the tactical means to achieve the non-use .
Strategists and moralists twisted and turned in the coils of this dilemma , even as the world lived ( as it still technically lives ) on the knife - edge of catastrophe .
Moralists pondered the virtue of threatening a crime in order not to commit it ; strategists wondered how a threat of " suicide " ( McNamara ) could be " credible " to the one so threatened .
None of them found answers , yet the policy became so deeply ingrained in policy circles that today people refer to the American nuclear arsenal as " our deterrent , " as if the hardware and its alleged purpose were one .
And yet the doctrine did also rest on one profound truth–its acknowledgment that " nuclear war can not be won and must never be fought , " as Reagan and Gorbachev put it in 1985 .
Implicit in this revolution in military affairs was a strategic revolution .
The political gains that governments had pursued through wars were given up , now replaced by a need to preserve the peace , which itself became the only sane strategic objective .
You might say that deterrence has pursued a sane goal by insane means–a cleavage manifested in the fact that even as deterrence fought off nuclear use , and in a certain sense fortified what has been called the " nuclear taboo " and the " tradition of non-use , " it at the same time pinioned the world permanently on the brink of such use .
Is it then possible that abolition can be seen as a rectification and completion of the strategic revolution begun but left unfinished by deterrence ?
How great , after all , would be the shift from the strategic goal of " non-use , " or the " tradition of non-use , " to the strategic goal of " nonpossession , " to a " tradition of nonpossession " ?
Does n’t non-use in a way already cast nuclear weapons on history ’s scrap heap ?
It is a peculiarity of deterrence that the weapons themselves , rather than political developments , dictate the strategic aim ( non-use ) .
In its pathological form , this peculiarity leads to the divorce of deployments and posture from politics that we see now .
But in the benign form of abolition , the strategy dictated by arms and the strategy dictated by policy would coincide .
Both would say , with the new Henry Kissinger : there is no quarrel in the world worth a nuclear war , so do n’t fight one or arm yourself to do so .
The conclusion is strengthened when you recall that even at zero , deterrence does not melt away completely .
The reason is that the roots of the nuclear dilemma lie in inextinguishable advances in scientific knowledge .
For even as this knowledge could permit cheaters to violate an abolition agreement , so it would permit the international community to respond in kind .
The point is not to propose overelaborate schemes of nuclear rearmament if a crisis were to occur at zero ( the conventional forces of the threatened international community would surely suffice ) but to point out that there is no sharp discontinuity , as is often suggested , between the " minimum deterrence " represented by , say , a few hundred weapons and zero .
Rather there is a smooth continuity all the way to zero , and even beyond , as political and legal as well as technical arrangements needed to keep the world at zero gradually strengthened .
Unfortunately , technical bans are all in principle reversible .
It has been otherwise with a few moral and legal revolutions , including the abolition of slavery , and there is reason to hope that the abolition of nuclear arms would be one of these .
When that happened , deterrence would have been left finally and completely behind .
The Architecture of Zero
The needed change is to turn abolition from a far - off goal into an active organizing principle that gives direction to everything that is done in the nuclear arena–in other words , a strategic goal .
The indivisible nuclear surge under way in today ’s world can be mastered only with an indivisible program to defeat it .
Let us , then , borrowing from Obama in Prague , take " the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons " as the new strategic objective –the political goal in the pursuit of which all tactics become the means .
That goal has two requisites .
The first is getting rid of existing nuclear weapons .
The tactical means to that goal are of course negotiations among the nuclear powers .
The second requisite is building a system that safeguards the world from the recrudescence of nuclear weapons once they are gone .
This system will be the true architecture of zero .
The tactical means to that goal are negotiating an ever - tightening web of restrictions imposed on all technology usable for nuclear weapons .
Of the two , the second is more difficult .
For while the process of nuclear disarmament will continue for only a limited time , until zero is reached , the architecture of zero must be built to last forever , since the knowledge that underlies nuclear weapons will never disappear .
The tactics for reaching this goal only begin with the construction of systems of inspection and enforcement .
More important over the long run is building a political and legal order in which the attempt to build a nuclear weapon would be designated a crime against humanity .
More important still would be the moral deepening of the taboo .
The art of strategy –so notably absent in today ’s contradictory mélange of policies–is to combine the measures needed to achieve the two goals into a single , coherent , self - reinforcing plan .
Above all , the nonproliferation efforts that are the precursors to an architecture of zero are in mortal need of the united planetary political will that can be created only by a clear , credible commitment to a time - bound plan for abolition to which all nuclear powers are formally agreed .
It should take the form of a commitment to create the sort of nuclear weapons convention that the antinuclear movement has long advocated–one that , as noted earlier , seeks to ban all weapons of mass destruction .
To postpone abolition is to postpone nonproliferation .
Today arms control and nonproliferation proceed in two parallel negotiating universes –the NPT review on the one side and START talks on the other .
The two need to be brought together in a simple bargain that is already implicit in the provisions of the NPT : the nuclear powers will surrender their arsenals on condition that other powers agree not to obtain any .
Such a strategy would build on the truth underlying deterrence doctrine while gradually retiring its absurd features .
It would enable nuclear strategy , at last , to catch up with history .
It would deliver Russia and the United States from the weapons - forged hostility that politically no longer exists .
It would unify the world around a common goal–one already embraced under the NPT by 184 countries and enshrined in their laws .
Nuclear states ( as long as they persist as such ) would be at one with nonnuclear states in preventing proliferation , even as they all worked together to put in place the architecture of zero that would make the ban permanent and safe .
Finally , the strategy would provide a measuring rod for judging the merit of interim steps , such as START and no first use .
They would be judged by the specific contribution they made to reaching the common strategic goal .
To give some examples : adoption of no first use by all nuclear powers would be highly valued as a way station toward abolition .
In principle at least , nuclear weapons would have been completely retired from use , for if no one strikes first , no one can strike in retaliation –thus no one will strike with a nuclear weapon at all , and no one will threaten to do so .
Arms reductions would , of course , have value as steps toward zero ; but the inspection regimes accompanying them would be especially prized , not just for their own sake but because an ever - stronger regime of inspection is a sine qua non of life in a world without nuclear weapons .
Influence would flow from nonproliferation measures to arms control as well .
The more nonnuclear - weapons states accepted stringent inspections , the more they permitted transparency of their nuclear facilities and the more they accepted restrictions on withdrawal from the NPT , the more ready would the nuclear powers be , less afraid now of cheating , to surrender their arsenals .
What would nuclear weapons then be for ?
They almost tell us themselves .
" We are here , " they say , " to abolish ourselves , and–a big bonus–to put up a barrier to major power war forever after into the bargain .
For even after you are rid of us , we will hover in the wings , as a potential that cannot ever be removed . "
The bomb is waiting for us to hear the message .
It has been waiting a long time .
If we do not , it can always return to what has always been its plan B , and abolish us .

If you 're skydiving and your parachute fails , there 's always a backup .
But what if the backup fails , too ?
That 's when you pray that you 're jumping with a hero like Dave Hartsock , who risked his own life to save someone else's .

Hartsock was the instructor paired with Shirley Dygert for her first ever skydive — a challenge she undertook to celebrate her 54th birthday .
But the jump took a nightmarish turn when their first parachute failed to fully deploy and the backup chute got tangled up along with it .
As they were plummeting toward the Earth at 40 mph , Hartsock pulled the chutes ' control handles to position himself underneath Dygert , hoping to break her fall when they hit the ground .
His plan worked : Dygert walked away with only minor injuries , though Hartsock himself was left paralyzed .
He 's slowly regaining some feeling , but even in recovery he remains humble about his actions :
People keep telling me that it was a heroic thing to do ...
In my opinion it was just the right thing to do .
I mean , I was the one who was completely responsible for her safety .
What other choices were there ?

There 's a trade off here .
I 'm left feeling a lot more skeptical about skydiving but even more optimistic about the ability of individuals to act with extraordinary courage when lives are on the line .

By Davis 's estimate , it took 12 - 15 minutes to get from the rig to the work boat , but it would take another 36 - 40 hours before they were to return to shore – even though there were dozens of boats in the area and Coast Guard helicopters airlifting the most severely injured to hospital .
Some of the men were openly furious , while others , like Davis , were just numb .
He says they were denied access to the onboard satellite phone or radio to call their families .
.... Lawyers say the isolation was deliberate and that Transocean was trying to wear the men down so they would sign statements denying that they had been hurt or that they had witnessed the explosion that destroyed the rig .
" These men are told they have to sign these statements or they can't go home , " said Buzbee .
" I think it 's pretty callous , but I 'm not surprised by it . "
Davis had been awake nonstop for about 50 hours by that point .
He signed .
Buzbee says most of the men did .
Congress should remind these criminal lawyers that contracts signed under duress are invalid .
Then they should pass an increase in the corporate liability limits for oil spills .
Independent video shot from a small plane by Southwings , hat tip to Glynn Wilson , shows the hellish nature of the spill yesterday as it spreads from the open ocean to the Louisiana marshlands .
Today on PBS radio it was reported that 5,000 barrels of oil per day are being recovered by the 4 inch pipe inserted into the main pipe .
The area ratio of the small pipe to the main pipe is about 25 to 1 .
That observation implies that the spill is 25 about times larger than BP previously admitted at approximately 125,000 barrels per day .
Thermal mapping with the AVHRR imager shows the loop current is spinning off multiple eddies that are transporting the oil in opposite directions .
Close examination of the photo shows Mississippi river water turning back towards shore in west Louisiana .
This shoreward current is carrying oil into the west Louisiana wetlands .
Meanwhile on the southern end of the spill the eddy in the Loop Current is rapidly transporting the oil southward .
At the final forecast time the Loop Current sends flow in 2 directions .
The predominant direction is towards the Florida Keys and the Gulf Stream .
Oil could be transported to Cuba by the Loop current within the week .
One week forecast
It could also be heading towards the Florida Keys and the Gulf Stream .
Two week current forecast .
Deep eddies may be transporting oil at 1000 meters across the Gulf of Mexico in ways that have been totally unanticipated .
Dead zones could be spreading by eddies deep in the Gulf in the cold water below the thermocline .
One week forecast at 1000 m
( Newser ) – A 21 - year - old man who jumped out a window to his death Saturday marks the ninth suicide of a worker at Foxconn , the Taiwanese - owned manufacturer of iPhones and iPods .
The deaths of young employees — combined with the fact that the company says it has prevented some 30 suicides in the past 3 weeks — show the signs of a suicide cluster , and have the company so baffled it has brought in a Buddhist monk to purge the plants of evil spirits .
Critics point to more earthly factors that could be motivating the suicides :
The well - educated young migrant workers who staff the factories crack under the demands of 15 - hour workdays , 7 days a week , the Telegraph reports .
Paid too poorly to be able to afford the products they build , the employees also tend to become socially isolated in vast factories where it is difficult for them to get to know their co-workers .

As part of his press conference yesterday , President Obama announced that he was suspending drilling permits for offshore oil temporarily , until environmental officials were able to assess the safety of these operations , now that the consequences of failing to do so are manifesting themselves in the Gulf .
This had Neil Cavuto and Eric Bolling at Fox News in a tizzy yesterday , complaining that the price of oil had already risen on the Obama 's news , and fearing that we might again see $ 5 - a - gallon gas this summer as a result .
Cavuto : I do n't want to sound too jaded or cynical , but -- do you think a lot of this was baked into the energy cake .
In other words , this accident happened , horrific as it was and is , and it -- it provided a very good excuse to just say " no , no " to " drill , baby , drill " .
Evidently , Cavuto still believes " drill baby drill " is a good idea .
But maybe he can explain to us the difference between " an obviously sound reason " and an " excuse " .
Because with Obama 's decision on drilling yesterday , those twenty - mile - long plumes of oil now in the Gulf are clearly the former .
Most of all , it leaves the proponents of " drill baby drill " without the latter .

I have heard that Jesus is God .
Under that belief ,
Did Jesus give the command to kill in the old Testament or God ?

Kill women , men and children .
" Then I heard the LORD say to the other men , " Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked .
Show no mercy ; have no pity !
Kill them all Ãll old and young , girls and women and little children .
But do not touch anyone with the mark .
Begin your task right here at the Temple . "
So they began by killing the seventy leaders .
" Defile the Temple ! " the LORD commanded .
" Fill its courtyards with the bodies of those you kill !
Go ! "
So they went throughout the city and did as they were told . "
( Ezekiel 9:5 -7 NLT )
This is what the Lord of hosts has to say : ' I will punish what Amalek did to Israel when he barred his way as he was coming up from Egypt .
Go , now , attack Amalek , and deal with him and all that he has under the ban .
Do not spare him , but kill men and women , children and infants , oxen and sheep , camels and asses . '
( 1 Samuel 15:2-3 NAB )
Which God is responible for Giving the command for killing , Jesus or God , or both because they are the same ?
peace

That is mans doing .
Why would God give the command " Thou shalt not kill " and then go back on His word ?
Seems kinda stupid to make a law and then tell everyone to kill .
God did not once give the command to kill .

I guess when people say " what would Jesus do ? " they are not supposed to think " what would God in Ezekial chapter 9 do ? "
But since the OT God is supposed to be Jesus as well , how do we pick which one to act like ?
Well if Jesus is God , and God supports killiing young , old , women , children , and infants when someone ticks him off , and we are supposed to spend our lives trying to become as much like Christ as we can , would n't that create a problem ?

Our thoughts and our values mean a lot to God .
He gave us the gift of free will .
he allowed us to come here to experience life for Him since He cannot leave His place in Heaven .
We run the earth , not God .
He has laws and when we break them , we certainly reap what we sow but God does not run the world .

Israel will not suffer meaningful consequence for its brutal attack on a flotilla of ships headed for Gaza earlier today .
It is reported the attack killed 20 humanitarian activists .
The military commando raid set off a storm of international protest and drew condemnations from leaders of Spain , Sweden , France , Germany , the U.N. , the European Union and Arab League .
Not that it matters .
Israel is basically allowed to kill anybody who opposes its annexation of Arab land and the wanton murder of Palestinians .
The Israeli military killed 34 and wounded 171 crew members aboard the USS Liberty on June 8 , 1967 , during the Arab - Israeli war and suffered no consequence .
Israel said it had confused the intelligence ship for an Egyptian vessel .
Many intelligence and military officials dispute Israel ’s explanation , but that does not matter .
Israel has a carte blanche to murder at will .
It is almost completely irrelevant when nations and aggrieved parties complain .
Israel assassins have killed hundreds of people , including the Swedish aristocrat Folke Bernadotte .
It is suspected Mossad attempted to kill ambassador John Gunther Dean , the top U.S. diplomat in Lebanon .
Israel is suspected of recent killings in Dubai , Damascus and Beirut .
“ While Israel ’s Mossad spy agency has been suspected of staging assassinations across the world since the 1970s , it does not officially acknowledge or admit its activities , ” the Times Online reported in February after a bus carrying Iranian officials and Hamas members exploded outside Damascus .
Sovereignty means nothing to Israel .
It has hundreds of agents , including members of Mossad operating in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq , Iran and Syria .
In July of 2006 , Israel killed hundreds of civilians in Lebanon , an effort that included U.S. participation .
At the time , Bush ’s Deputy Secretary of State , the neocon Richard Armitage , said the illegal attack on Lebanon was a template the U.S. should use for an attack on Iran .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
Earlier this year Iran captured Jundallah leader Abdolmalek Rigi .
In an interview , Rigi told Press TV that before his arrest Jundallah had held a series of meetings in Casablanca with a group who had claimed to be NATO contacts and said suspected Israeli or U.S. agents had given him a list of people to assassinate in Tehran .
The media in Israel proudly admits that PM Benjamin Netanyahu authorized the assassination of Hamas commander Mahmoud al - Mabhouh in Dubai on January 19 , 2010 .
The assassins carried Irish , British , French and Australian passports .
Dubai police said that the assassins obtained credit cards issued by an American bank using their passports , and then used them to buy plane tickets and other items related to the assassination .
Non-violent political and humanitarian activists are a favored target of the Israeli state .
In 2003 , an Israeli military bulldozer killed Rachel Corrie , an American member of the International Solidarity Movement .
On 11 April 2003 , Tom Hurndall , a British volunteer for the International Solidarity Movement , was fatally shot in the head by an IDF sniper in the Gaza Strip .
Israel is immune to international condemnation of its murderous efforts to continue the illegal and immoral colonialist occupation of Palestine .
Editorials of outrage and condemnation published in Europe , the Arab world , and the United States over the latest psychopathic episode will not deter Israel in the least , not so long as an AIPAC - mesmerized ( and intimidated ) Congress continues to shower Israel with billions of dollars and remains silent on its homicidal rampages .
Nothing short of ending the generous largess provided by the American taxpayer to the state of Israel will put an end to its murder campaign .
Israel is by far the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid .
Since 1949 , the United States has provided Israel with $ 101 billion in total aid , of which $ 53 billion has been military aid .
For the last 20 - plus years , Israel has received an average of $ 3 billion annually in grant aid , note Kathleen and Bill Christison .
The “ raid ” on the humanitarian flotilla received the “ full backing ” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
Following the murderous attack , Netanyahu canceled this week ’s scheduled meeting with Obama .
Obama “ expressed deep regret at the loss of life in today ’s incident , and concern for the wounded , ” notes a statement released by the White House .
He “ also expressed the importance of learning all the facts and circumstances around this morning ’s tragic events as soon as possible , ” according to CNN .
In order to once again excuse Israeli barbarity , CNN said the lives of the heavily armed and professionally trained Israeli commandos were in danger after they were attacked with “ severe physical violence , including live fire , weapons , knives and clubs . ”
CNN , of course , did not bother to mention reports that Israeli troops came on board shooting .
“ Film footage from the vessel showed armed Israeli soldiers boarding the ship and helicopters flying overhead .
Israelis shot indiscriminately into groups of sleeping civilians , ” reports Pravda .

Pull back all the girl power politics and strong role model manipulation and you have one of the rare actors who understands the needs of the narrative , no matter how outrageous or unrealistic .
I ’ve been doing a little bit ( that is , a very little bit ) of hacking on Padre .
Partly because I wanted to do something different ( it ’s been a long time since I ’ve worked on a non-web UI ) .
Partly because I wanted to contribute to an OSS project .
And partly because I think Padre is pretty important to the Perl community .
Why is it important ?
One thing we can probably all agree on is that it ’s vital for Perl ( or really any community ) to have a steady stream of new blood joining its ranks .
Without new people , even an impressive clan of grey - beards will struggle to prevent the community from going stale .
Perl needs to attract new people , both novices and experienced developers .
How do we do that ?
Obviously , by making the language and key modules awesome .
I think it ’s safe to say we ’re on the right track here , with the improvements to the Perl release process , Moose , Catalyst , etc .
Plenty of words have already been blogged on this , so I wo n’t go into it further .
Making the community accessible is also a big plus .
Perl Monks has always been the envy of other communities , and innovations like Iron Man help too .
But there ’s one other area that helps attract prospective developers : tools .
As chromatic pointed out recently ( and as confirmed by a poll run by Gabor Szabo ) , Perl is a community very strongly biased towards * nix .
It ’s not surprising given Perl ’s heritage .
There are even a bunch of unix - like commands built into the language .
On top of this , another poll by Gabor shows a huge percentage of Perl developers using vi or emacs as their main editor when developing Perl .
( Obviously there are biases in the samples of these polls , but they ’re probably more reflective of people active in the community , who tend to have the most influence ) .
vi and emacs may work for you , but they do n’t for a large part of the rest of the world .
If you talk to a Java developer ( probably the biggest group of developers in the world , right now ) about taking up another language , one of the first questions they ’ll ask is “ what ’s the IDE like ? ”
There are very few Java devs who do n’t use Eclipse , or some other IDE .
OK , so they may have to , because that ’s what work makes them use ( or because Java has become so unwieldy that it ’s near impossible to develop without one ) , but the point is that that ’s what they ’re used to .
That ’s one of the first things they ’ll be looking for , just as a Perl dev might look at the regex support of a language they ’re considering .
One of the goals of Padre has always been to help get beginner developers involved with Perl .
That ’s a no-brainer .
If you ’ve lived your whole life on Windows and not really programmed before , you ’re hardly going to want to wrestle with a unix command - line , vi , and Perl all at once .
Padre can hopefully help those people .
But just as important is the more experienced developer , who ’s maybe heard about some of the cool stuff going on in Perl , and wants to have a go .
Again , going back to the Java world – many Java devs spend most of their time on Windows .
Despite Java being pretty cross-platform , development on Linux can often be trickier than on Windows .
Not to mention , a lot of them are trapped in corporate hell ( a place from which I ’ve recently escaped – thankfully ) , where they do n’t have a choice .
For me , the ideal situation would be that , if a reasonably experienced developer wants to try out Perl , they can be pointed to a simple step - by - step guide that let ’s them download a version of Perl for Windows , Mac or * nix , install an IDE , and be up - and - running within an hour .
Without that , we may find our potential recruits giving up in frustration before they ’ve had a chance to play with the things that we think makes Perl worthwhile .
The point is , while Perl may have come from a * nix , vi/emacs background , that does n’t mean it has to be that way forever .
There ’s a lot more competition in the language market these days , so it makes sense to broaden your appeal as much as possible .
I hope Padre can go some way towards that .
( By the way , I realise there are other IDEs around that work well with Perl .
But as far as I know , Padre is the only one that ’s open source and written in Perl . )
An Afghan prosecutor has issued an arrest warrant for an American special forces commander over allegations that a police chief was murdered by a US - trained militia .
Brigadier General Ghulam Ranjbar , the chief military prosecutor in Kabul , has accused the US of creating an outlaw militia which allegedly shot dead Matiullah Qateh , the chief of police in the city of Kandahar .
The militia , which Ranjbar claimed is armed and trained by US special forces , also allegedly killed Kandahar 's head of criminal investigations and two other officers , when they attempted to free one of their members from a courthouse .
" We lost one this country 's best law enforcement officers for the [ attempted ] release of a mercenary , " said Ranjbar , interviewed for a film to be shown on Channel 4 News tomorrow .
He accused American officials of refusing to hand over evidence or to permit his investigators to interview the special forces commander , known to Afghans only as " John or Johnny " , who he alleges sanctioned the raid .
The arrest warrant , which has been circulated to border posts and airports , is an embarrassment for the US military , which is facing growing criticism for links to militias controlled by warlords .
In Kandahar , the militias have been accused of murder , rape and extortion .
Ranjbar said an investigation found that the force that killed Qateh operated from Camp Gecko , in the hills outside Kandahar , a base for both US special forces and the CIA .
Officials in Kandahar said the militia supplies guards and is trained to work alongside special forces and intelligence officials in raids against Taliban targets .
" If you go to Kandahar , people say these guys pretend to be interpreters but they carry out night raids and assassinations , " said Ranjbar .
" We hear lots of strange and shocking stories . "
He claimed that suspects arrested for the courthouse raid had confessed to being part of a 300 - strong militia unit run by " Johnny " .
They said they " could not move a muscle and could not leave their base without Johnny 's orders " Ranjbar said .
" He was the head of the group and they [ the Americans ] were the ones paying them . "
Colonel Wayne Shanks , a spokesman for the US military , denied that any US or other coalition forces were involved in the attack , and said those involved " were not acting on behalf of US or international forces " .
But , according to the Afghan account , the militia known locally as the " Kandahar Strike Force " , or the " Kandahar Special Group " , arrived at the courthouse last June with US - supplied uniforms , vehicles and weapons .
They demanded the release of a comrade held for a traffic offence .
When police were called to the scene by terrified court officials , the militia opened fire , killing Qateh , and three other policemen .
" The police chief took two steps forward and that 's when they fired , " claimed a witness , who showed Channel 4 the crime scene , pockmarked with bullet holes .
" Within a couple of seconds the chief was sprayed with bullets .
Then the head of CID came over .
He pulled out his pistol and prepared to fire , but he was shot from behind . "
The involvement of the Camp Gecko militia is politically sensitive because of its alleged close ties to Ahmed WaliKarzai , brother of the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai .
Militia members claim to have been recruited by associates of Ahmed Wali , who press reports have claimed is on the CIA payroll .
Interviewed by telephone , Ahmed Wali called for an amnesty for the 41 men convicted of Qateh 's murder , but denied he had any militia connections .
Local militias have also been linked to a raid on 10 November last year when US and Afghan troops allegedly burst into the home of Janan Abdullah , 23 , riddled him with bullets , and left his wife paralysed and the rest of his family traumatised .
" Nothing was left undamaged , they shot at everything , " said one of Janan 's uncles .
" He was just lying in bed .
I 'd say they fired 200 bullets at him . "
The family claimed it was Afghans who did the shooting and stole thousands of pounds in cash .
" We were surprised , " said the uncle .
" It was our own people – Pashtuns – doing this to us . "
A US military spokesman said they had " no record " of the raid .
However , the family were given medical treatment at Camp Gecko , leading to suspicions that it was the same Afghan militia that allegedly killed the police chief .

The status of Iraq has always framed the strategic challenge of Iran .
Until 2003 , regional stability — such as it was — was based on the Iran - Iraq balance of power .
The United States invaded Iraq on the assumption that it could quickly defeat and dismantle the Iraqi government and armed forces and replace them with a cohesive and effective pro-American government and armed forces , thereby restoring the balance of power .
When that expectation proved faulty , the United States was forced into two missions .
The first was stabilizing Iraq .
The second was providing the force for countering Iran .
The United States and Iran both wanted to destroy Saddam Hussein ’s Baathist regime , and they collaborated to some extent during the invasion .
But from there , their goals diverged .
The Iranians hoped to establish a Shiite regime in Baghdad that would be under Tehran ’s influence .
The United States wanted to establish a regime that would block the Iranians .
The U.S. Challenge In Iraq
In retrospect , U.S. strategy in Iraq was incoherent at base .
On one hand , the American debaathification program drove the Sunni community into opposition and insurgency .
Convinced that they faced catastrophe from the Americans on the one side and the pro-Iranian government forming in Baghdad on the other , the Iraqi Sunni Baathists united in resistance with foreign jihadists .
At the same time the Americans were signaling hostility toward the Sunnis , they also moved to prevent the formation of a pro-Iranian government .
This created a war between three factions ( the Americans , the Shia and the Sunnis ) that plunged Iraq into chaos , shattered the balance of power with Iran and made the United States the only counterweight to the Iranians .
All of this turned what was intended to be a short - term operation into an extended war from which the United States could not extract itself .
The United States could not leave because it had created a situation in which the Iranian military was the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf region .
Absent the United States , the Iranians would dominate Iraq .
They would not actually have to invade ( Iran ’s military has a limited ability to project force far from its borders in any case ) to extract massive political and economic concessions from both Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula .
An unchecked Iran , quite apart from its not - yet - extant nuclear capability , represents a profound strategic threat to the balance of power in the Persian Gulf .
Assuming the nuclear issue was settled tomorrow either diplomatically or through attacks , the strategic problem would remain unchanged , as the central problem is conventional , not nuclear .
The United States is set to complete the withdrawal of its combat forces from Iraq this summer , leaving behind a residual force of about 50,000 support personnel .
This drawdown is according to a plan former U.S. President George W. Bush laid down in 2008 , and that U.S. President Barack Obama has sped up only by a few months .
Therefore , this is not a political issue but one on which there has been consensus .
The reason for the withdrawal is that U.S. forces are needed in Afghanistan .
Even more important , the United States has no strategic reserve for its ground forces .
It has fought a two - theater , multidivisional war for seven years .
The Army is stretched to the limit , and should another crisis develop elsewhere in the world , the United States would lack the land power to respond decisively .
Avoiding this potential situation requires drawing down U.S. forces from Iraq .
But simply abandoning the Persian Gulf to Iranian military and political power also represents a dangerous situation for the Americans .
Therefore , the United States must balance two unacceptable realities .
The only hope the United States has of attaining this balance would be to achieve some semblance of its expectations of 2003 .
This would mean creating a cohesive Iraqi government with sufficient military and security capabilities to enforce its will internally and to deter an attack by an Iranian force .
At the very least , the Iraqis would have to be able to hold off an Iranian attack long enough to allow the United States to rush forces back into Iraq and to suppress insurgent elements from all Iraqi communities , both Sunni and Shiite .
If Iraq could do the former , the Iranians likely would refrain from an attack .
Iranian rhetoric may be extreme , but the Iranians are risk - averse in their actions .
If Iraq could do the latter , then they eliminate Iran ’s preferred mode of operations , which is covert subversion through proxies .
The issue therefore boils down to how the United States answers this question : Can the Iraqis form a coherent government in Baghdad capable of making decisions and a force capable of achieving the goals laid out above ?
Both the government and the force have to exist ; if either one is lacking , the other is meaningless .
But alongside this question are others .
Does Iraq have any strategic consensus whatsoever ?
If so , does it parallel American strategic interests ?
Assuming the Iraqis create a government and build a significant force , will they act as the Americans want them to ?
State vs. Faction
The United States is a country that believes in training .
It has devoted enormous efforts to building an Iraqi military and police force able to control Iraq .
The Americans have tried to imbue Iraq ’s security forces with “ professionalism , ” which in the U.S. context means a force fully capable of carrying out its mission and prepared to do so if its civilian masters issue the orders .
As professionals , they are the technicians of warfare and policing .
But perhaps the fundamental question of any military force , one that comes before training , is loyalty .
In some militaries , the primary loyalty is to oneself .
In such militaries , one joins to make a living , steal what one can and simply survive .
In other militaries , the primary loyalty is not to the state , but some faction of the country , be it religious , ethnic or geographical .
No one is going to give his life defending a state to which he is indifferent or even hostile , no matter how carefully trained in handling his weapon or how well - lectured he is on the question of professional responsibility .
Neither of these conditions allows for a successful military in the end .
A man in it for himself is not going to go into harm ’s way if he can help it .
A man in the military to protect his clan is not going to die to protect those to whom he has no loyalty .
The U.S. Army has trained tens of thousands of Iraqis .
And Americans are great trainers .
But the problem is n’t training , it is loyalty .
Professionalism does n’t imbue anyone with self - sacrifice to something alien to him .
And this is the challenge the United States faces in the Iraqi government , which like most governments , consists of many factions with diverging interests .
In viable states , however , fundamental values shared by the overwhelming majority lie beneath the competing interests , be they a myth of country or of the moral principles of a constitution .
It is simply not apparent that Iraqi factions have a core understanding of what Iraq should be , however , nor is it clear whether they owe their primary loyalty to the state or to some faction of Iraq .
Saddam Hussein held the state together by a complex of benefits and terror .
He became the center of Iraq , and in a sense became Iraq .
Once he was destroyed , Iraq ’s factions went to war with each other and with the United States , pursuing goals inimical to a united Iraq .
Therefore Iraq ’s reconstituted military and security forces , however intermixed or homogenized they may be , still owe their individual loyalties to their factions , which will call on them to serve their people , a subset of Iraq .
The United States plans to withdraw its combat forces by the summer .
Leaving aside how well - protected the remaining 50,000 noncombat troops will be , the question persists on who will hold the country together .
The Iranians certainly are not eager to see the Iraqi situation resolved in favor of a government that can block Iran ’s ambitions .
The Iranians have longstanding relations with any number of Iraqi Shiite groups , and even with some Kurdish and Sunni groups .
Iran would have every reason to do what it can to destabilize Iraq above and beyond any indigenous destabilization of Iraq in order to help shape a government it can dominate .
In our view , Tehran has the tools to do this effectively .
The American leadership is certainly aware of this .
It may hope or even believe that a stable Iraqi government will emerge , and it will certainly not say anything publicly that would decrease confidence in the process .
But at the same time , the American leadership must privately know that the probability of a cohesive Iraqi government commanding a capable and loyal security force is far from a slam dunk .
In Search of a Plan B
Therefore , logic tells us that the United States must have a Plan B .
This could be a plan to halt withdrawals .
The problem with that plan is that there is no assurance that in three months or a year the core divisions of Iraq could be solved .
The United States could be left without forces for a strategic reserve without any guarantee that time would solve the problem .
A strategy of delay calls for some clear idea of what delay would bring .
Or the United States could complete the withdrawal on the assumption that the Iranians would not dare attack Iraq directly while the residual U.S. force remained .
The problem with this strategy is that it is built on an assumption .
This assumption is not unreasonable , but it is still an assumption , not a certainty .
Moreover , Iran could covertly destabilize Iraq , putting U.S. forces without sufficient combat capability in harm ’s way from Iranian - supplied forces .
Finally , Iran ’s major audience consists of the oil powers of the Arabian Peninsula .
Tehran wants to show the Gulf Arabs that the United States will withdraw from Iraq regardless of potential consequences to them , reducing their confidence in the United States and forcing them to contemplate an accommodation with Iran .
Halting the withdrawal therefore poses substantial challenges , and completing the withdrawal poses even more .
This is particularly the case if the United States completes the withdrawal without reaching some accommodation with Iran .
But negotiating with the Iranians from a position of weakness is not an attractive option .
The Iranians ’ price would be higher than the United States wants to pay .
Therefore , the United States would have to make some show of power to the Iranians that will convince the Iranians that they are at risk .
Bombing Iran ’s nuclear facilities could fit the bill , but it has two drawbacks .
First , the attacks might fail .
Second , even if they succeeded , they would not have addressed the conventional problem .
Washington ’s way forward depends upon what the American government believes the probabilities are at this point for a viable Iraqi government and security force able to suppress insurgencies , including those fomented by Iran .
If the Americans believe a viable Iraqi government is a possibility , they should roll the dice and withdraw .
But it is not clear from our point of view what Washington is seeing .
If it believes the probability is low , the United States not only will have to halt the withdrawal , it will have to reverse it to convince the Iranians that the Americans are hypercommitted to Iraq .
This might cause Tehran to recalculate , opening the door for discussion .
It is now April , meaning we are four months from the deadline for the completion of the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Iraq .
In the balance is not only Iraq , but also the Iranian situation .
What happens next all comes down to whether the mass of parties in Baghdad share a common foundation on which to build a nation — and whether the police and military would be loyal enough to this government to die for it .
If not , then the entire edifice of U.S. policy in the region — going back to the surge — is not merely at risk , but untenable .
If it is untenable , then the United States must craft a new strategy in the region , redefining relationships radically — beginning with Iran .
As with many things in life , it is not a matter of what the United States might want , or what it might think to be fair .
Power is like money — you either have it or you do n’t .
And if you do n’t , you ca n’t afford to indulge your appetites .
If things in Baghdad work themselves out , all of this is moot .
If things do n’t work out , the Obama administration will be forced to make its first truly difficult foreign policy decisions .

A reader called our attention to an extraordinary statement made in February by Richard Alderman , left , director of the U.K. ’s Serious Fraud Office .
His subject was how Britain ’s new bribery bill will work .
He was asked about transferring a majority interest in a profitable subsidiary of a ( presumably ) U.K. company to the family of the president of a developing country .
The transfer was a condition of continuing to do business there .
Here ’s what he said :
While we cannot compromise overall ethical standards , there needs to be considerable sensitivity as to how those standards play out . . .
And so , what does this mean ?
Let me give you an example .
I was approached by the Board of a corporate that is involved in one of these [ developing ] countries .
They had a 100 % subsidiary .
This was becoming very profitable and so they received an approach from the Government .
They were told that if they wanted to continue to do business in the country then they would need to transfer a 51 % interest in the subsidiary to the family of the President .
That gave rise to all sorts of worries for them for obvious reasons .
One of these was whether or not the SFO would take the view that payment in this way was a bribe .
They were concerned we might investigate and prosecute .
I assured them that I would have no intention of doing that whatsoever .
I said I recognised the very great difficulty of the moral and ethical position that they were in .
This was something they would have to resolve .
What I could do though was to give them comfort that whatever they did , we would be sensitive to the circumstances here and would not seek to take any action , even if technically the transfer of the interest in the subsidiary constituted a bribe .
They found that very helpful .
Under the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act , the transfer to the president ’s family would likely be illegal .
Director Alderman ’s full remarks can be found here .
More modest version of Va. seal unveiled
By Washington Post Editors
Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli is opting for a more modest depiction of the state 's seal .
The seal depicts the Roman goddess Virtus wearing a blue tunic draped over one shoulder with her left breast exposed .
But on the new lapel pins Cuccinelli recently handed out to his staff , her bosom is covered by an armored breastplate .
Workers in attendance when the new design came up at a staff meeting said Cuccinelli joked that it converts a risque image into a PG one .
But the joke might be on Cuccinelli , said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato .
“ When you ask to be ridiculed , it usually happens .
And it will happen here , nationally , ” he said .
“ This is classical art , for goodness ' sake . ”
Cuccinelli has found himself at the center of political controversy numerous times since taking office in January .
The conservative Republican was ridiculed on Comedy Central 's “ The Daily Show ” in March after advising state colleges and universities they lack the legal authority to protect gay employees from discrimination .
Cuccinelli spokesman Brian Gottstein said the attorney general has pointed out the “ more modest attire , ” saying the rendition “ harkens back to an older version of the seal . ”
The pins were paid for by Cuccinelli 's political action committee , not with taxpayer funds , Gottstein said .
The Great Seal of the Commonwealth is a two - sided image that dates to 1776 .
But multiple varieties of the seal have been used over the years , said State Capitol historian Mark Greenough .
The side depicted on the state flag features Virtus standing victoriously over Tyranny , a male figure prone on the ground in defeat , his crown fallen from his head .
Beneath him is the motto Sic Semper Tyrannis : Thus Always to Tyrants .
The modern version is based on language added to the state code in 1930 .
It specifies that Virtus is “ dressed as an Amazon ” while clutching a spear in one hand and a sword in the other .
The secretary of the commonwealth , Janet Polarek , is charged by law with being the keeper of the seal , but declined to offer an opinion on Cuccinelli 's interpretation .
When Virtus was fighting Tyranny , Polarek said , “ a dress code was probably not her first concern . ”
-- The Virginian - Pilot
When it comes to climate change , the only thing the U.S. has more of than culpability is opportunity .
Yet , as a nation , we continue to abdicate leadership .
One of the most serious global challenges we face , climate change is not just coming ; broad scientific consensus indicates that it is already here .
Fossil fuel interests , not surprisingly , predict economic catastrophe will result from climate action .
We ’ve seen these scare tactics before .
Removing lead from gasoline was going to bankrupt the oil companies .
Requiring seat belts and airbags would cripple auto sales .
Federal acid rain , smog , and mercury controls would cause price shocks in electricity bills .
Such claims were n’t believable then , and they ’re not believable now .
The on - the - ground experience of companies already cutting greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions shows huge opportunity for our nation ’s economy .
Stonyfield Farm is a good example .
We started calculating our carbon footprint in the early 1990s – even before the term was coined .
With little more than our mission and elbow grease , our employees raced up the learning curve .
Contrary to conventional wisdom about “ low - hanging fruit , ” our list of innovation opportunities grew rather than shrank .
Even after over a decade of effort , recent accomplishments astonish : each cup of Stonyfield yogurt requires 19 percent less energy than in 2007 , saving more than $ 500,000 per year .
Packaging innovations shed 600,000 pounds of plastic , saving $ 780,000 .
Transportation GHG emissions dropped 40 percent from 2006 to 2008 , saving $ 2.5 million .
Building a digester to treat our wastewater converted an environmental concern into a source of clean energy , saving another $ 500,000 over two years .
All together , our efficiency efforts saved over $ 2.6 million per year over the last three years , supporting more than 45 jobs , about one - eighth of our New Hampshire workforce .
Stonyfield ’s experience is n’t unique .
Companies across the U.S. are finding cost savings and competitive advantage through efficiency .
Nike reduced GHGs from its operations and business travel by 18 percent from 1998 to 2005 , despite an increase in square footage .
Timberland has targeted a 50 percent reduction in absolute GHG emissions for 2010 from 2006 levels .
Wal - Mart ’s new stores are expected to cut energy use by 30 - 50 percent and save five million gallons of water per year .
Other companies are seizing on clean energy solutions to help businesses and consumers save energy and money .
New England Wood Pellet in Jaffrey produces roughly 150,000 tons per year of clean sustainably - produced wood pellets .
That ’s enough to heat 60,000 homes and businesses and staunch some of the $ 10 - $ 14 billion that flows out of the Northeast each year for heating oil , much of it into the pockets of unfriendly countries overseas .
Economical and versatile in their uses , wood pellets are a win - win alternative to fossil fuels , with only 13 percent the carbon footprint of heating oil .
As good as the above efforts are , they must go broader and deeper throughout the entire economy to prevent profound changes to our climate .
That wo n’t happen on its own , so Congress should hasten to impose a market price signal on U.S. heat - trapping emissions .
If the U.S. Senate cannot act promptly in the coming months , on the heels of last year ’s House action , then the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency needs to move ahead with regulating GHGs under the federal Clean Air Act .
Our economy may be weak , but successful companies and economies “ retool ” during downturns to boost future productivity and job creation .
A wave of innovation and jobs in energy technologies is emerging in this region and globally .
The resulting energy transition will exceed even the tectonic shifts we ’ve seen with the Internet .
Initial investments to lead this charge are already happening , but they are small potatoes compared to the investments that policy certainty and a price on carbon will bring .
We do n’t have all day either ; many nations are now racing ahead of the United States on job - creating clean energy technologies .
Washington ’s best contribution would be to limit and put a price on carbon – right now .
Then it should get out of the way of businesses striving to help our nation meet the opportunities of the 21st century .
Morphing our energy system from its historical fossil foundation to a new emphasis on efficiency , innovation , renewables , and distributed generation will provide innumerable new revenue sources and businesses , save money ( and keep it closer to home ) , create millions of new jobs , enhance our global competitiveness , and boost our national security .
What on Earth are we waiting for ?
Let ’s get on with it .

Wendy Dio Responds To Westboro Baptist Church 's Message About Ronnie
Band Photo : Black Sabbath ( ? )
In what would seem to be in response to the highly publicized plans of Westboro Baptist Church to picket Ronnie James Dio's memorial service and the information they posted about the man and his beliefs and legacy , Wendy Dio has issued the following update on RonnieJamesDio.com :
" Ronnie hates prejudice and violence !
We need to turn the other cheek on these people that only know how to hate someone they did n't know .
We only know how to love someone we know ! "
As it 's been discussed quite thoroughly in the comments of our previous article , I 'd venture to say she 's right .
Code : sudo apt - get remove pulseaudio gstreamer0.10-pulseaudio
I just did a clean install of Ubutnu 10.04 .
I then removed pulseaudio and gstreamer0.10 - pulseaudio using : APT then removed a bunch of other pulseaudio related packages .
It also removed the ubuntu - desktop metapackage .
With some trepidation , I let APT do it 's thing .
I have since logged out and rebooted with no ill effects .
Sound works fine with alsa ; and the ubuntu desktop is intact with all my settings preserved .
Pulse Audio is less of a resource hog in 10.04 than it was in 9.10 .
However , it still was using more of my CPU ( around 3 - 4 % with one sound app running , and up to 12 - 14 % with 2 sound apps running ) than alsa , so I removed it !
I have no need for pulse audio .
Hope this helps .

A new , longer look at the ' Fringe ' season finale !
Fringe type TV Show network Fox
Take a verrrry close look at this brand - new , extended Fringe season - finale trailer .
You ’ll see that Josh Jackson ’s Peter Bishop gets “ taken to the other side ” ( ah , that would actually be his true home , would n’t it ? ) .
You ’ll see alternate - universe versions of some of our favorite characters , including a very bad - ass Broyles in black paramilitary garb , and you ’ll hear Walter say with some understandable worry , “ My son is going to be responsible for the end of the world . ”
Nina admitting Massive Dynamic does n’t have a way of getting to the other side , but that Olivia does ?
That certainly pays off a bit on the “ specialness ” she ’s been exhibiting this season , does n’t it ?
And how about that brief glimpse of the alt - Astrid ?
My dear CortexiFans , what do you think of this glimpse of Fringe ‘s finale ?
( The first half of the finale airs this Thursday night . )
Plays kinda like a summer - movie trailer , in a good way , does n’t it ?

For decades , the U.S. dollar has been the reserve currency of the world .
This has given the United States an extraordinary amount of economic power , but as the U.S. economy has started to come apart over the past decade , other nations have increasingly sought to move away from the U.S. dollar and find other alternatives .
For a long time it was thought that the Euro would become the next great reserve currency of the world .
However , the recent Greek debt crisis , along with massive financial instability in nations such as Portugal , Spain and Italy , has caused investors to rapidly lose confidence in the Euro .
In fact there are even some whispers that the Euro may not even survive the sovereign debt crisis as it sweeps across Europe .
With both the U.S. dollar and the Euro looking shaky , investors have been searching somewhere safe to put their money .
Increasingly , they have been turning to gold .
So has gold now become a new reserve currency ?
Will all of this new demand drive the price of gold into unprecedented territory ?
Well , the truth is that as long as paper currencies around the world continue to show instability , gold will continue to be a preferred choice .
Nations all over the world are looking for ways to diversify their very large foreign exchange reserves .
For example , China now has approximately $ 2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves , and has been wanting to reduce its position in U.S. dollars for quite some time now .
But where should they put their money ?
The Euro is coming apart like a 20 dollar suit .
There is a very real fear that Greece is only the first domino to fall and that soon nations like Italy , Spain and Portugal will be begging the IMF for assistance as the sovereign debt crisis sweeps across Europe .
Well , what about the British pound ?
The truth is that the pound is not very appealing right now because the U.K. is facing a massive government debt crisis as well .
In fact , Bank of England governor Mervyn King recently warned that public anger over the “ austerity measures ” that soon must be implemented in the U.K. will be so intense that whatever party wins this election will be out of power for a generation .
Well , how about the Japanese yen ?
Ironically , there has been a move towards the Japanese yen in recent days , but the truth is that the Japanese debt situation is one of the worst in the world .
Japan ’s gross public debt has reached 201 percent of GDP and Japan ’s battle with deflation dragged into its 13th straight month in March .
No , the yen is not safe at all .
So does that bring us back to the U.S. dollar ?
No .
There is a reason why nations all over the world have been wanting to get out of the U.S. dollar .
The United States has piled up the biggest mountain of debt in the history of the world , and even official U.S. government reports admit that the U.S. government is on a financial path that is not even close to sustainable .
The U.S. economy is caught in a death spiral , and that makes the U.S. dollar very unsafe .
So , what is safe at this point ?
Well , gold is .
The price of gold rose to $ 1,210 an ounce on Friday .
The terms “ flight to quality ” and “ safe haven ” are increasingly being used for the precious metal as investors flee all of the major global paper currencies .
Just consider some of the recent comments about gold by financial experts that have shown up in the news … .
Stephen Platt , a commodity analyst at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago :
“ The sovereign - debt panic is spreading and forcing a flight to quality into gold . ”
Citigroup analyst David Thurtell :
“ Gold is now enjoying safe haven status , partly because bonds , particularly peripheral euro zone government and bank paper , is no longer a safe haven . ”
Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk , Virginia - based Gartman Letter :
“ There is a clear flight into quality to the gold market as frightened capital seeks a haven of any sort while confusion reigns . ”
So will this move towards gold continue ?
Sure .
Although anyone who follows the gold market knows that big financial institutions regularly work to suppress the price of gold .
In fact , one industry insider recently decided to be a whistleblower and came forward with “ smoking gun ” evidence of price manipulation in the precious metals markets , but the CFTC did n’t do a thing about it .
Fortunately , the overwhelming demand for gold is now pushing the price up despite efforts to suppress it .
In addition , once it becomes apparent that most of the “ gold ” that is traded in the world is not backed by the actual metal itself , the price of gold will go even higher .
For years , almost everyone has assumed that the London Bullion Market Association ( LBMA ) , the world ’s largest gold market , had actual gold to back up the massive “ gold deposits ” at the major LBMA banks .
But that is just not the case .
People are now starting to realize that there is very little actual gold in the LBMA system .
When most people think they are buying “ gold ” , what they are actually buying are just pieces of paper that say they own gold .
Egon von Greyerz of Matterhorn Asset Management in Switzerland recently elaborated on this point .
He says that “ a lot of people who have studied it closely are convinced that there is a major shortage in physical gold at LBMA .
LBMA trades around 700 tons net of gold daily .
That is 25 % of world annual production and around $ 6 trillion annually .
To back that amount of trading on a 100 % reserve ratio basis , it would need several year ’s production of physical gold , which they definitively have n’t got . ”
So what is going to happen when investors start demanding physical delivery of the gold that they purchase ?
It is going to create a huge mess .
Needless to say , if you are investing in gold make sure that you take physical delivery of the gold .
As the paper currenices all over the globe continue to unravel ( as all debt - based paper currencies always do ) , all precious metals , including gold , will be increasingly in demand .
In fact , the idea of gold being a “ reserve currency ” is not anything new .
Gold has been a “ reserve currency ” for thousands of years , and those who understand history know that it will always remain one .
It still amazes me that when you speak the truth you 're labeled as some sort of cretin who does n't understand what 's really happening .
Such was the case with my last post , when I had the audacity to claim this unprecedented era of Detroit Red Wing hockey was about to end .
And whether you can handle the truth or not , it ’s a fact - an era is about to end .
Regardless of how the playoffs turn out , your red and white clad hockey heroes are about to turn the page .
That does n't mean Detroit is going to freefall to the bottom of the NHL standings .
Ken Holland told me several years ago that his job is to win today with one eye on tomorrow .
The Wings ’ GM was well aware he was part of a brain trust that had assembled a hockey club that would define the ‘ modern era ’ .
Holland also recognized some day it would end .
However , unlike a panic - driven fan base , Holland ’s ‘ end of an era ’ does n’t translate into “ we ’re going to stink . ”
“ We ’re not going to be as dominate as we have been , ” Holland acknowledges .
“ Especially with the salary cap .
It ’s a whole different approach on how to build your team and remain competitive .
I just do n’t want us to sink too far down in the standings . ”
With some carry over from the last era ( Pavel Datsyuk , Henrik Zetterberg , Tomas Holmstrom , and perhaps Nick Lidstrom ) , the next era of Red Wing hockey will have a solid foundation .
If younger players ( Darren Helm , Justin Abdelkader , Jakub Kindl , Brendan Smith , and Gustav Nyquist ) continue to develop , the Wings will remain a force in the NHL .
They simply wo n't be what we have witnessed for the last two decades - the NHL ’s best overall team by a country mile .
Those days are over .
Calm down Red Wing fans .
Your team is changing , but their philosophy remains the same .
They will draft skill and intelligence , and fill out their roster with veteran players who can easily adapt to their puck possession style of play .
Their organization is best the in professional sports , it ’s not even debatable .
We all have confidence in their abilities .
Look at it this way : it ’s Thanksgiving , you take a look around the dinner table and you become reflective because you see over the years your family has changed .
Some members are gone forever and new additions are beginning to grow into a prominent role – contributing to the family legacy .
It may take some time , and mistakes will be made , but through good times and bad it ’s your family .
Life never stands still ; it ’s in constant motion and the Red Wings are about to go through a life - changing moment .
Accept it , embrace it and never forget what they ’ve accomplished in previous generations
CAIRO , March 19 ( Reuters ) - Engineering group Siemens SIEGn .DE has taken another step towards becoming one of the world 's top three wind turbine makers by 2012 by installing a 250 - megawatt renewable energy plant in Egypt 's Gulf of Suez on the Red Sea coast .
Egypt ’s state news agency quoted Emad Ghali , head of Siemens ’s renewable energy , oil and gas operations , as saying Egypt has huge potential in generating renewable energy , but has not used it optimally .
The agency ’s report gave no further details on the project .
Until recently Germany - based Siemens has ranked as the world 's sixth biggest manufacturer of wind turbines in terms of market share , behind Denmark 's Vestas VWS.CO , U.S. General Electric GE.N , Spain 's Gamesa GAM.MC , Germany 's Enercon and India 's Suzlon SUZL.BO .
Siemens , which is Europe ’s biggest engineering conglomerate , said last week it was on track towards becoming one of the world ’s top three wind turbine makers by 2012 .
[ ID : nLDE62B0OD ]
Research shows that the world market for wind turbine installations was worth about 45 billion euros ( $ 61.25 billion ) in 2009 and that global installed capacity will more than double to 340 gigawatts by 2013 .
Egypt , an oil and gas producer , has been developing wind power along its eastern Red Sea coast .
It has wind farms at Zafarana and Hurghada in the area , and has so far installed capacity of 430 megawatts of wind energy .
Officials say Egypt ’s combined oil and gas reserves will last the most populous Arab country roughly three decades , encouraging a shift to alternative energy sources , including wind , solar and nuclear .
The North African country expects to see its wind power capacity reach 7,200 megawatts by 2020 and is already boosting the capacity to 550 megawatts by May .
Egypt also aims to generate 12 percent of its power from wind farms out of a total of 20 percent from renewable sources by 2020 and is seeking to attract $ 110 billion in investments in its energy sector by 2027 .

Its electricity ministry said in November it qualified 10 firms to build a 250 - megawatt wind farm on its east coast , the country ’s first privately owned wind farm . [ n L9384811 ] ( $ 1=.7346 EURO ) ( Writing by Sherine El Madany ; Editing by Rupert Winchester )
Where Does the Name Nylon Originate ?
By : Chris Nickson - Updated : 29 Aug 2020 | * Discuss Tweet
Q .
Was NYLON named after New York and London ?
If so - why ?
( T.S , 7 May 2009 )
A .
The story that the name nylon came from combining the names of New York and London has been around for a long time – almost as long as nylon itself .
It ’s a good tale , and one with possibly even a little romance to it .
Unfortunately , however , it ’s not true .
Nylon was first produced in 1935 ( on February 28 , if you want to be precise ) by a chemist working for DuPont named Wallace Carothers .
A silky thermoplastic material , there is nothing organic about nylon – it ’s completely man-made .
First used to replace real bristles in toothbrushes , it found its great fame as a substitute for silk stockings , so much so that nylons became the generic term .
The uses for nylon multiplied , and now it can be found in so many things , from carpets to tyres .
It ’s become so universal that it can sometimes seem hard to believe there was a world before it , and it was especially useful during World War II , where there was a shortage of natural materials .
As to the word nylon , it ’s actually quite arbitrary .
DuPont itself has stated that originally the name was intended to be No - Run ( that ’s run as in the sense of the compound chain of the substance unravelling ) , but at the time there was no real justification for the claim , so it needed to be changed .
It was the discoverer , Carothers , who was responsible for that .
He changed the name , letter by letter , until finally the management at DuPont accept what he ’d come up with – which was nylon .
Unfortunately , he reportedly committed suicide prior to the name being finalised , and actually was n’t even working on nylon in his last year of life , which casts some doubt on the veracity of that .
That , at least , was the explanation in 1978 .
Back in 1940 it was a little different .
In that year , the company ’s John W. Eckelberry stated that the first three letters – the nyl – had no read meaning at all , whilst the on suffix was inspired by that used in other fibres .
So there are two contrasting , and both official , stories .
But neither mention nylon as coming from NY and London .

I remember seeing a BBC documentary about Wallace Carothers , in which the New York - London idea was debunked .
It seems a lot of people do not want to accept the real origin of the name .
i.e. nothing to do with 2 cities .
Funny how folk cling to fallacies .
In all walks of life .

As to what i have studied , NYLON is the acronym to Now You Lost Out , Nippon , in which Nippon was the japanese name for Japan , and it was named so to taunt japanese silk companies because at that time , japan was at the top of the silk industry
michael - 13 - Apr -16 @ 4:14 PM
I worked for a manufacturer of carpets in South Africa during the mid to late 1960s and was told by a senior ( in both position and age ) Du Pont man at that time , that the name Nylon came about as a combination of the two cities because the first large and meaningful customer for the product was the English government of the time ( 1938/9 ) who were looking for a replacement for the cotton that had been diverted from civilian clothing to military clothing .
That was good enough for me both then and now .

I too was told by a senior management person from Dupont in about 2002 in Martha 's Vineyard that the name was derived from a visit to the UK with a bundle of the fiber in hand with an apocryphal name , let 's say 57444 which was what it was called and when pressed insistently for a ' real name ' and not a number , looked down at the luggage that he had and saw NY Lon and thus the name .
It sounded real and sincere to me .

I worked for a manufacturer of carpets in South Africa during the mid to late 1960s and was told by a senior ( in both position and age ) Du Pont man at that time , that the name Nylon came about as a combination of the two cities because the first large and meaningful customer for the product was the English government of the time ( 1938/9 ) who were looking for a replacement for the cotton that had been diverted from civilian clothing to military clothing .
That was good enough for me both then and now .
Welcome to the official website for the Playa Hermosa Artificial Reef Project , located just north of Playas del Coco in the province of Guanacaste , Costa Rica .
The project has been affectionately nicknamed “ Condo - Fish ” for the fish habitats , or “ condominiums , ” that we have constructed here .
So far , things are moving along swimmingly .
This is the first project of it ’s kind to be approved by the Costa Rican government .
The fish and aquatic plant life are taking well to their homes and multiple species have already begun laying eggs on the structures .
We see more and more life each time we scuba dive down to it .
Our History section gives a detailed story of how this project started and where it ’s headed .
To read more about the drive and energy behind this venture please read the message from the founder .
For those interested in supporting the The Playa Hermosa Artificial Reef Project , Condofish units are now available for adoption 10 meters ( 30 feet ) below the surface .

Washington ( CNN ) --
When Arizona police ask suspected illegal immigrants for IDs , they are protecting your grandchildren 's economic future .
Three years ago , ETS -- the people who administer the SAT -- released an alarming study .
It combined information on test scores with demographic trends to predict that the U.S. work force of 2030 would be less literate , less skilled and worse paid than the U.S. work force of 1990 .
ETS reported : " [ B ] y 2030 the average levels of literacy and numeracy in the working - age population will have decreased by about 5 percent while inequality will have increased by about 7 percent .
Put crudely , over the next 25 years or so , as better - educated individuals leave the work force they will be replaced by those who , on average , have lower levels of education and skill .
Over this same period , nearly half of the projected job growth will be concentrated in occupations associated with higher education and skill levels .
This means that tens of millions more of our students and adults will be less able to qualify for higher - paying jobs . "
Why ?
One word : Immigration .
Since 1970 , America 's largest source of immigrants has been Latin America , especially Mexico .
More than half of these Latino immigrants lack a high school diploma .
Compare the U.S. experience with Canada's .
More than half of all immigrants to Canada possess a university degree .
Half of all Canada's Ph.D.s are foreign - born .
Why does America choose poorly educated immigrants ?
The short answer : America does not choose them .
They choose themselves .
In the last decade , half of all the immigrants to the United States arrived illegally .
Even many of the legal arrivals gained entry courtesy of relatives who originally slipped into the country against the law , then somehow regularized themselves .
By contrast , Canada ( a country of 1/10 the U.S. population that takes proportionately many more immigrants than the United States ) allows almost no illegal immigration .
The result :
While immigration has enhanced the average skill level of the Canadian population , it has detracted from the average skill level of the U.S. population .
Many Americans carry in their minds a family memory of upward mobility , from great - grandpa stepping off the boat at Ellis Island to a present generation of professionals and technology workers .
This story no longer holds true for the largest single U.S. immigrant group , Mexican - Americans .
Stephen Trejo and Jeffrey Groger studied the intergenerational progress of Mexican - American immigrants in their scholarly work , " Falling Behind or Moving Up ? "
They discovered that third - generation Mexican - Americans were no more likely to finish high school than second - generation Mexican - Americans .
Fourth - generation Mexican - Americans did no better than third .
If these results continue to hold , the low skills of yesterday 's illegal immigrant will negatively shape the U.S. work force into the 22nd century .
The failure to enforce the immigration laws in the 1990s and 2000s means that the U.S. today has more poorly skilled workers , more poverty and more workers without health insurance than it would have generated by itself .
Arizona 's new law against illegal immigration can do only so much to address the problem :
• The law does not reach into the workplace , which is where enforcement will have most effect .
• It is not sufficiently neutral : Much better to check the work eligibility of all job applicants than to screen suspicious people at traffic stops .
• It is easily evaded by crossing into another state for work .
Yet there is good reason to expect that effective reduction of illegal work opportunities will slow the illegal immigration flow .
The Center for Immigration Studies estimates the recession has induced a decline of 1.7 million in the illegal population , as some illegals have opted to return home and potential illegals have decided against trying to enter .
Effective enforcement could have further effect .
At a minimum , it seems irresponsible for political leaders in Washington to speculate about amnesty before enforcement has had its full effect .
Amnesty talk invites more illegal immigration , by raising hopes that those who can slip into the country in the next months will be allowed to stay .
Arizona 's law offsets that loose talk .
The law may expose Arizona 's leaders to criticism .
But it is at least a beginning contribution to a stronger American work force and a wealthier American future .

ATLANTIC CITY
-- An 85 - foot research vessel pulled away from Barney ’s Dock in Atlantic City last Thursday , an American flag fluttering from its rigging , and a yellow painted buoy perched on its stern .
Riding the tide , the trawler headed for a spot 2.8 miles as the crow flies from Tennessee Avenue and the Boardwalk before dropping the buoy , bristling with scientific instruments , into the cold waters of the Atlantic .
It is the beginning of a two - year wind and whale study for what may end up being the nation ’s first offshore wind farm , where pylon - mounted turbines perched high above the waves , driven by huge , aerodynamic blades spinning freely to catch the wind , are expected to generate enough power one day to light up thousands of homes .
New Jersey is in a race to have the first offshore wind - generated power project , and the state just might beat Massachusetts , where U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar last week announced the approval of a 130 - turbine wind farm in Nantucket Sound .
That project , under review for nine years , continues to be threatened by lawsuits .

• State gets $ 4 million to aid construction of wind farms
The issue has taken on renewed urgency as the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , which threatens wildlife and beaches along the Louisiana and Florida coastline , has dampened enthusiasm for offshore drilling .
On Friday , a group of New Jersey lawmakers called for a moratorium on oil exploration off parts of the Atlantic Coast , and urged the federal government to speed up the permitting process for offshore wind farms .
The shore of the Garden State slopes to a shallow continental sea shelf — perfect for locating turbines — and at least four sites are under study .
Three are in federal waters as far as 20 miles from shore .
A fourth , the focus of the research being conducted out of Atlantic City , is in state waters much closer to land .
The technology of harnessing energy from the wind harkens back to the iconic windmills of Holland , updated by modern materials .
Conical towers are typically anchored to the seabed , rising above the ocean , where a nacelle on top houses a generator spun by helicopter - like rotors .
The electricity produced is then brought ashore through underwater cables to land - based substations for distribution .
Wind farms , planted like hundreds of steel trees along barren hilltops and wind - swept ridges , are already producing electricity around the world .
But sites offshore offer unique advantages .
The wind blows far more steadily at sea and the sound and vibration from spinning rotors do n’t bother neighbors .
However , the challenges of building and maintaining equipment that will hold up in the harsh marine environment of the coastline , and opposition to the esthetics of the turbine towers , has made for slow going at sea .
The Cape Wind project in Massachusetts , for example , has met with heavy resistance from critics who say the project will endanger wildlife and mar historic vistas .
Ocean research kicks off campaign to create offshore wind farm in Atlantic City
New Jersey officials say offshore wind energy could supply 3,000 megawatts — far more than a nuclear power plant — while helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent in the next decade .
“ We can take the lead on wind energy , ” said Gov. Chris Christie at an energy forum last month .
“ New Jersey can be the first state to get that energy and harness it . ”
Testing the waters
Last year , the state Board of Public Utilities gave development rights , and $ 4 million in rebates , to three off - shore wind companies to build test towers .
The companies were granted interim licenses for four proposed sites off Jersey ’s shore .
NRG Bluewater Wind of Princeton has proposed a 348 - megawatt project more than 13 miles out , with 80 to 100 turbines .
Garden State Offshore Energy , a joint venture between Deepwater Wind , of Hoboken , and PSEG Renewable Generation , will be building a test tower for its 345 - megawatt project more than 16 miles out .
Fishermen ’s Energy of Cape May will use its buoy to test a site in state waters for a proposed 20 - megawatt project less than three miles out , where a meteorologic tower is not needed .
The cost of building nine turbines there is roughly $ 100 million , about $ 5 million a megawatt .
The company is planning a 350 - megawatt wind farm some 10 miles out to sea .
So far there has been little opposition in New Jersey to wind energy .
Indeed , in Atlantic City , wind power has become a tourist attraction .
Trolley tours go out to the five land - based windmills operated by the Atlantic County Utilities Authority , according to Elaine Zamansky , a spokeswoman for the Atlantic City Convention & Visitors Authority .
“ People do stop , ” she said .
“ I ’m not sure there would be any objection to more of them off shore .
Surveys of residents and visitors by developers have found overwhelming support , and while many environmental groups support the projects because they provide clean energy and create jobs , the New Jersey Sierra Club , which supports more renewable energy from the wind , said the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico demonstrates the starkness of the choices to be made .
“ Right now , decisions are being made in Washington on whether to continue with the fossil foolishness of the past or move to clean energy , ” said Sierra Club director Jeff Tittel .
“ This week , we see both happening : the approval of the wind farm off Massachusetts and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
We ca n’t have it both ways . ”
Urging caution
Yet not all advocates agree .
Tim Dillingham of the American Littoral Society , an ocean and avian conservation group , cautioned against a rapid expansion of offshore wind generation without further environmental studies .
“ Our concerns are making sure that these large industrial facilities do not harm the ocean , which they have the potential to do , ” he said .
“ We think the ocean provides a tremendous amount of benefit to New Jersey right now .
We need to take good care of it to make sure it continues to do so . ”
Dillingham noted that whales and marine mammals now migrate off the coast of New Jersey , and the state is a major migratory pathway for birds .
“ What ’s the impact of putting those structures in the migratory pathways ? ” he asked .
“ We ’re talking about 1,000 windmills or more .
That is a lot of structure out there . ”
The Department of Environmental Protection is expected to release a $ 7 million , two - year study of the wildlife in the wind turbine zone in June .
Offshore wind power is going to be a component of any portfolio that addresses the issues of global warming , said Eric Stiles , chief operating officer and vice president for conservation and stewardship at the New Jersey Audubon Society .
But he said it must be approached with reason .
“ You do it in areas where you can expect a high wind return with acceptable impacts , ” he said .
“ It ’s not rocket science .
There are zoning models and we ’ve been doing it on land for over a century . ”
For Dan Cohen , a second - generation fisherman , it represents a new catch to haul from the sea .
Cohen , now president of Fishermen ’s Energy , first opposed wind farms because he thought they would damage his fishing grounds .
“ Then I realized that all of us in society have a responsibility to sustainability , ” he said .

Ash from the Icelandic volcano grounded tens of thousands of flights
Italy has fined Irish low - cost airline Ryanair 3 m euros ( £ 2.5 m ) for failing to help passengers after cancelling their flights during the volcanic ash crisis .
Italy 's civil aviation authority said it knew of 178 cases of passengers who did not receive mandatory assistance , such as food , between 17 and 22 April .
Ash from Iceland 's Eyjafjallajokull volcano triggered a massive shutdown of European airspace last month .
A spokeswoman for Ryanair said the allegation was " complete rubbish " .
" Ryanair fully complies with EU [ Regulation ] 261 and has been complimented by the EU , " she said .
The ash cloud paralysed many airports and left an estimated eight million tourists and business travellers stranded .
Italy 's air agency , Enac , accused Ryanair of failing to provide passengers at Rome 's Ciampino airport with drinks , foods and accommodation as required by European law .
Enac found that most other airlines had managed to meet their obligations despite the difficult circumstances .
Ryanair initially insisted it would only refund the cost of passengers ' tickets , but later agreed to fully implement European regulations and pay all " reasonable expenses " .
Under EU Regulation 261 , if a flight is cancelled , those flying with European carriers into or out of the EU have the right to a refund or to be re-routed .
If passengers chose the latter , they have the right to care - such as accommodation and meals - while they wait .
* SAFER Campus asks why reproductive coercion — - or birth control sabotage — - ai n’t criminalized yet .
One woman shares her story , naturally , on Facebook :
A recent event has caused me to question [ what ] it means to be sexually assaulted . . .
While sleeping with a guy [ he ] decided to take off the condom without me realizing it and when he was fingering me he pulled out my nuvaring without telling me .
I saw [ my ] nuvaring on the ground and he admittedly told me that he had pulled it out .
The next day I wrote Eric an email asking him to never contact me again .
I think that birth control sabotage should absolutely be considered sexual assault ; consenting to one sex act does n’t imply consenting to all of them , and consenting to sex with and without a condom are two very different things .
( Just in the interest of clarification : You can remove the NuvaRing for up to three hours and still be prevented from pregnancy ) .

I ’ve seen cophrophagy porn , senior citizen porn , a porn in which Ron Jeremy appeared as a baby in an adult diaper and a bonnet , midget porn , world - record setting gangbang porn ( I was present for one of those , and it ’s hard to say which was worse ) , so - called “ ready to drop ” pregnancy porn , and a movie in which a series of young women had sex with men and then promptly threw up onto a black tarp spread over a sagging bed after taking what I assumed to be Ipecac .
Suffice to say , it takes a lot to shock this reporter when it comes to porn movies .
Max ’s movies are n’t shocking — not most significantly .

Last night 60 Minutes broadcast a stunning report on the Deepwater Horizon disaster featuring an eyewitness account from crewmember Mike Williams and analysis from Dr. Bob Bea , a UC Berkeley engineering professor asked by the White House to help figure out what went wrong .
According to Williams , several weeks before the explosion , the blowout preventer was damaged but despite the damage , BP ordered the rig operator to ignore critical a safety measure when sealing the well .
BP wanted the rig operator to seal the well without using drilling mud , a heavy liquid used to keep oil and gas from burbling up as cementers completed the seal .
According to Professor Bea , the accident would not have occurred had the drilling mud been used .
Instead , BP cut corners in an attempt to save money , and now we 're left with this enormous economic and ecological disaster .
You can watch part 1 of the report here , but the key section is here in part 2 , starting about 2 minutes into the clip :
It gets worse : 60 Minutes reports a BP insider says he is concerned about another risky rig , the Atlantis platform .
According to the insider -- whose account is confirmed by internal BP e-mails -- nearly 90 % of the safety documents needed to run the platform safely had n't been reviewed by BP .
At best , BP is flying blind on the Atlantis , so this could all happen again .
One important implication of this report : BP's $ 75 million liability cap for economic damages does not apply if the company is guilty of willful negligence , and if last night 's 60 Minutes report on the disaster is accurate , BP will certainly be on the hook for everything .

* Company , creditors agree liquidation is best
* Movie Gallery filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February
NEW YORK , May 10 ( Reuters ) - Movie Gallery Inc MVGRQ.PK , the operator of the Hollywood Video rental chain , said it plans to close its remaining stores and liquidate its operations .
The decision by the second - largest U.S. video rental company after Blockbuster Inc BBI.N was revealed in a Friday filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Richmond , Virginia .
Movie Gallery filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years on Feb. 3 after sales fell and losses mounted .
The Wilsonville , Oregon - based company initially planned to close just one - third of its 2,415 U.S. stores .
But according to the filing , Movie Gallery decided to close after triggering a default provision under one of its loans .
“ It is in the best interests ” of the company and creditors that Movie Gallery wind down operations , the filing said .
The filing did not provide a timetable for the liquidation , which requires bankruptcy court approval .
Movie Gallery ’s answering service was not accepting messages on Monday and a recorded message said the company is not responding to most media inquiries .
A call to a lawyer for the company was not immediately returned .
Video retailers such as Movie Gallery and Blockbuster have suffered as customers switched to Google Inc's GOOG .
O YouTube , the Netflix Inc NFLX.O mail - order service and kiosk operators such as Coinstar Inc's CSTR .O Redbox .
Blockbuster said in March it might need to seek bankruptcy to address a roughly $ 1 billion debt .
Its auditor said there was “ substantial doubt ” about the company ’s survival .
Movie Gallery filed for bankruptcy in October 2007 and emerged the following May with private equity firm Sopris Capital Associates LLC and affiliates as its majority equity owner .
But operating losses mounted and revenue last year fell to $ 1.4 billion from $ 2 billion in 2008 .
Movie Gallery ’s bankruptcy filing did not include its Canadian operations .
The company has also operated stores under the Movie Gallery and Game Crazy brands .
The case is In re Movie Gallery Inc , U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Eastern District of Virginia , No. 10-30696 .

The above is not an exercise in geometric abstraction .
It ’s an attempt to do something seemingly simple , but to the best of my knowledge , impossible in CSS .
The challenge is this :
Given a container , fill the container with n items of variable width , with the leftmost item flush with the left border , and the rightmost item flush with the right border , and an equal amount of space between each .
Unpossible !
Try it .
This is n’t a contrived example .
Being a pixel pedant , when we started in on our app for Shopify , where images may be any size within a bounding square , distributing them equidistantly seemed The Thing To Do .
Here ’s a shot from our test shop with the items properly distributed and the text properly centered under them :
So , let ’s step through the options :
. container { border : 1 px solid # 333 ; width : 520 px ; margin- bottom : 1em ; } .container ul { padding : 0 ; margin : 0 ; } .container ul li { margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; display : inline ; } .container { border : 1 px solid # 333 ; width : 520 px ; margin - bottom : 1em ; } .container ul { padding : 0 ; margin : 0 ; } .container ul li { margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; display : inline ; }
< div class=" container " > < ul > < li ><img src= " 80.png " /></li> < li ><img src=" 100.png " /></li> < li ><img src= " 80.png " /></li> < li ><img src=" 100.png " /></li> < li ><img src= " 60.png " /></li> </ul > </div > < div class=" container " > < ul > < li ><img src= " 80.png " /></li> < li ><img src=" 100.png " /></li> < li ><img src= " 80.png " /></li> < li ><img src=" 100.png " /></li> < li ><img src= " 60.png " /></li> </ul > </div >
That gives us the first box , things are messily clumped along the left side of the container .
I quickly threw in the towel and went for a table .
With a table it was easy to get things distributed evenly , but with ragged extreme borders :
table .container { width : 522px ; border - spacing : 0 ; } .container td { text - align : center ; padding : 0 ; margin : 0 ; } table .
container { width : 522 px ; border - spacing : 0 ; } .container td { text - align : center ; padding : 0 ; margin : 0 ; }
< table class=" container " > < tr > < td > < img src= " 80.png " /></td> < td >< img src=" 100.png " /></td> < td > < img src= " 80.png " /></td> < td >< img src=" 100.png " /></td> < td > < img src= " 60.png " /></td> </tr> </table > < table class=" container " > < tr > < td > < img src= " 80.png " /></td> < td >< img src=" 100.png " /></td> < td > < img src= " 80.png " /></td> < td >< img src=" 100.png " /></td> < td > < img src= " 60.png " /></td> </tr> </table >
But if we want to make the extremities flush , we ’re stuck with a larger - than - mean gap between the first two and last two boxes :
. flush td . first { text - align : left ; } . flush td .last { text - align : right ; } . flush td. first { text - align : left ; } . flush td.last { text - align : right ; }
< table class=" container flush " > < tr > < td class = " first " >< img src= " 80.png " /></td> < td >< img src=" 100.png " /></td> < td > < img src= " 80.png " /></td> < td > < img src=" 100.png " /></td> < td class = " last " >< img src= " 60.png " /></td> </tr> </table > < table class=" container flush " > < tr > < td class = " first " >< img src= " 80.png " /></td> < td >< img src=" 100.png " /></td> < td > < img src= " 80.png " /></td> < td > < img src=" 100.png " /></td> < td class = " last " >< img src= " 60.png " /></td> </tr> </table >
It turns out that the only way to do this seemingly simple task is to compute the margins ourselves and set them via Javascript .
Here we take a table just like our second one , but with a “ adjust ” ID so that we can find it easily :
function adjust ( id ) { var table = document .
getElementById ( " adjust " ) ; var row = table .
firstElementChild .
firstElementChild ; var cells = row .
children ; var totalImages
Width = 0 ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < cells .
length ; i ++ ) { var image = cells [ i ] .
firstElementChild ; totalImagesWidth += image .
offsetWidth ; } var extra = row .
offsetWidth - totalImagesWidth ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < cells .
length ; i ++ ) { var image = cells [ i ] .
firstElementChild ; var padding = extra / ( cells .
length - 1 ) ; var buffer = Math .
floor ( padding * i ) - Math .
floor ( padding * ( i - 1 ) ) ; if ( i == 0 || i == cells .
length - 1 && cells .
length >= 2 ) { cells [ i ] . style .
textAlign = ( ( i == 0 ) ? " left " : " right " ) ; cells [ i ] . style .
width = ( image .
offsetWidth +
Math .
floor ( buffer / 2 ) ) + " px " ; } else { cells [ i ] . style .
textAlign = " center " ; cells [ i ] . style .
width = ( image .
offsetWidth + buffer ) + " px " ; } } } if ( window .
addEventListener ) { window .
addEventListener ( " load " , adjust , false ) ; } else if ( window .
attachEvent ) { window .
attachEvent ( " onload " , adjust ) ; } function adjust ( id ) { var table = document.getElementById(" adjust " ) ; var row = table .firstElementChild.firstElementChild ; var cells = row.children ; var totalImages Width = 0 ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < cells.length ; i++) { var image = cells[i].firstElementChild ; totalImagesWidth += image.offsetWidth ; } var extra = row.offsetWidth - totalImagesWidth ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < cells.length ; i++) { var image = cells[i].firstElementChild ; var padding = extra / ( cells.length - 1 ) ; var buffer = Math.floor ( padding * i ) - Math.floor ( padding * ( i - 1 ) ) ; if ( i == 0 || i == cells.
length - 1 && cells.length >=
2 ) { cells[i].style.textAlign = ( ( i == 0 ) ? " left " : " right " ) ; cells[i].style.width = ( image.offsetWidth + Math.floor ( buffer / 2 ) ) + " px " ; } else { cells[ i].style.textAlign = " center " ; cells[i].style.width = ( image.offsetWidth + buffer ) + " px " ; } } } if ( window.addEventListener ) { window.addEventListener(" load " , adjust , false ) ; } else if ( window.attachEvent ) { window.attachEvent( " onload " , adjust ) ; }
Now things get adjusted just as we ’d want them .
Let ’s walk through the steps :
var table = document .
getElementById ( " adjust " ) ; var row = table .
firstElementChild .
firstElementChild ; var cells = row .
children ; var table = document.getElementById(" adjust " ) ; var row = table .firstElementChild.firstElementChild ; var cells = row.children ;
Here we just get a handle to our building blocks , the table , row and cells .
var totalImages
Width = 0 ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < cells .
length ; i ++ ) { var image = cells [ i ] .
firstElementChild ; totalImagesWidth += image .
offsetWidth ; } var totalImagesWidth = 0 ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < cells.length ; i++) { var image = cells[i].firstElementChild ; totalImagesWidth += image.offsetWidth ; }
Now we compute the total width of all of the images used in the table .
We ’ll use that to figure out how much left - over space we have to distribute :
var extra = row .
offsetWidth - totalImagesWidth ; var extra = row.offsetWidth - totalImagesWidth ;
From there we go in to assign this to each cell :
for ( var i = 0 ; i < cells .
length ; i ++ ) { var image = cells [ i ] .
firstElementChild ; var padding = extra / ( cells .
length - 1 ) ; var buffer = Math .
floor ( padding * i ) - Math .
floor ( padding * ( i - 1 ) ) ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < cells.length ; i++) { var image = cells[i].firstElementChild ; var padding = extra / ( cells.length - 1 ) ; var buffer = Math.floor ( padding * i ) - Math.floor ( padding * ( i - 1 ) ) ;
The padding is simply the extra space divided by the number of gaps that we have , but we compute the buffer for each iteration so that all of the left over pixels do n’t accumulate at the end — i.e. if we had 7 items and the space between each should be in theory 10.333 … pixels , that would leave us with 3 extra pixels stuck into the last gap .
By doing the floor of each iteration and subtracting the previous value , we end up with appropriately distributed spare pixels .
if ( i == 0 || i == cells .
length - 1 && cells .
length >= 2 ) { cells [ i ] . style .
textAlign = ( ( i == 0 ) ? " left " : " right " ) ; cells [ i ] . style .
width = ( image .
offsetWidth +
Math .
floor ( buffer / 2 ) ) + " px " ; } else { cells [ i ] . style .
textAlign = " center " ; cells [ i ] . style .
width = ( image .
offsetWidth + buffer ) + " px " ; } } if ( i == 0 || i == cells.
length - 1 && cells.length >=
2 ) { cells[i].style.textAlign = ( ( i == 0 ) ? " left " : " right " ) ; cells[i].style.width = ( image.offsetWidth + Math.floor ( buffer / 2 ) ) + " px " ; } else { cells[ i].style.textAlign = " center " ; cells[i].style.width = ( image.offsetWidth + buffer ) + " px " ; } }
The second half of the loop just sets the cells at the extremities to be left / right aligned and gives each cell half of the buffer space for each of their internal gaps .
The ones on the edges only need half of the buffer allocation since they do n’t have a buffer on their outside edges .
The sad thing is this is actually a much simplified version of the real code .
The real code also accounts for :
Centering text under these images ( Sounds easy right ?
No .
You have to compute the margins manually also . )
Dealing with stylesheets where images have margins , padding and borders and still making the right thing happen .
Only one item being shown .
Minimum sizes for images , centering them if they ’re smaller ( you do n’t want to try to center text below a 5 pixel wide image that ’s right aligned )
I can get into the mechanics of those in another post if necessary and have been considering stripping the real implementation out of our widget and throwing it up on Github where it can take a nice , clean JSON structure and turn it into a table of images , text , prices and links .
Give a holler in the comments if you ’d find such useful .
And with that , I ’ll leave you with a gallery of what - this - looks - like - in - real - life shops , from the annals of our Shopify customers .
A first - time paraglider broke his back in two places after trying to fly in a machine he bought for £ 300 on eBay .
Roy Dixon did not take any lessons apart from looking at internet clips on YouTube , and made the mistake of tethering his paraglider to his car .
After less than a minute in the air , he fell 40 ft ( 12.2 m ) and was taken from the scene near Hexham , Northumberland , by RAF helicopter to hospital .
Mr Dixon had been with his wife , Catherine and nephew , Michael .
The pain was like an explosion going off inside me
Roy Dixon Speaking from Newcastle General Hospital after the incident on Sunday , the 45 - year - old volunteer for the Mercy Trucks charity , which delivers medical aid to the Third World , said he was embarrassed and had been " quite foolish " .
He returned only a few weeks ago from disaster - stricken Haiti and said he had been looking forward to some fun after months of stress in some of the world 's most deprived areas .
He said : " I should have joined a club and got lessons but I was trying to teach myself and learn from bits I had seen on YouTube . "
Mr Dixon , who used to project manage golf course construction before working entirely voluntarily for the Christian charity , added : " The thing you should never do , which I did , was tether it to a solid object .
" I went shooting up in the air , then banged down on the ground .
Then I went up again .
' Very blessed ' " As I was dropping , I was thinking , ' this is serious ' .
" The pain was like an explosion going off inside me . "
Mr Dixon , who has flown microlight aircraft in the past , broke two vertebrae which might now have to be fused .
But he said he felt lucky not to have been paralysed or killed .
" I am very blessed that I got off so lightly , " he said .
" I am very embarrassed about the cost of the rescue and using all these resources up . "

Series Overview
This is Part V of a comprehensive multi-part article series with in - depth measurements and analysis for the OLED and LCD displays on the Google Nexus One , the Apple iPhone 3GS and the Motorola Droid .
It is produced as a collaboration between DisplayBlog and DisplayMate Technologies .
We will show you the good , the bad , and also the ugly unfinished rough edges and problems lurking below the surface of each of these displays and display technologies .
Each article will be introduced and discussed on DisplayBlog by Jin Kim , followed up with a detailed technical analysis and measurement data on the DisplayMate website .
Part I deals with the Google Nexus One Part II with the Apple iPhone 3GS , and Part III is a detailed point - for - point Shoot - Out comparison between the displays on Nexus One and the iPhone .
Part IV deals with the Motorola Droid and Part V is a detailed point - for - point Shoot - Out comparison between the displays on the Nexus One and the Motorola Droid .
Introduction
There have been lots of articles and discussions comparing the iPhone , Nexus One and Motorola Droid displays , but no one has yet done anything more than superficial eye ball commentary .
This article series is an in - depth scientific analysis of these displays .
The Nexus One display is distinctive and unusual in several respects : it is an Organic LED display , which is an emissive display technology , whereas most mobile devices have an LCD display , which uses a static backlight behind the panel .
The screen is 3.7 inches diagonally and has a high - resolution high - density 800x480 pixel display with a screen Aspect Ratio of 1.67 .
The Motorola Droid has a traditional LCD display with a White LED backlight .
The screen is 3.7 inches diagonally and has a high - resolution high - density 854x480 pixel display with a screen Aspect Ratio of 1.78 , which is identical to standard 16:9 widescreen displays , such as HDTVs , which have an Aspect Ratio of 1.78 .
Both phones use the Google Android OS .
The Nexus One was tested with version 2.1 and the Motorola Droid with version 2.0.1 .
We found so many image and picture quality problems and implementation issues with the display on the Nexus
One that it will be especially interesting to see whether the Motorola Droid , which has the same Android OS , suffers from the same problems and issues , or whether Motorola did a better job of engineering the display hardware , firmware and software than Google and HTC .
Important Note for Android OS 2.1 Upgrade
The tests for this article were performed using the original 2.0 Android OS for the Motorola Droid .
Afterwards , when the Droid was upgraded to version 2.1 , the Gallery ( the principal image viewer for the phone ) surprisingly downgraded to 16 - bit color from its original full 24 - bit color in version 2.0 .
Fortunately , version 2.1 of the Android Browser on the Droid still delivers full 24 - bit color .
Image Scaling for the Gallery ( which adjusts images so they fit the native resolution of the display ) went from Excellent in version 2.0 to Poor in version 2.1 , the same as for the Browser ( both versions ) .
As a result the beautiful screen shots for the Droid in Figure 1 in Part IV now look exactly like those for the Google Nexus One on the left .
Overall , the Droid still delivers substantially better picture quality and accuracy than the Nexus One .
Presumably these errors , which affect both the Droid and the Nexus One will be fixed in a future software upgrade , so the Droid will at some point return to its original excellent 24 - bit color and scaling .
The quality of the 24 - bit color and scaling for the Nexus One remains to be seen …

Google acknowledges these problems for all 2.1 Android phones including the Nexus One and Motorola Droid .
The next major release of the Android OS will fix these issues and provide full 24 - bit color and improved scaling .
Click Here to Read the Google and Cooliris Statements .
The inner details of the display technologies are very interesting , but our concern here is to evaluate the actual image and picture quality that they deliver , so we do n’t really care how they do it , as long as they do it well .
None - the - less with the measurements and analytical test patterns we will learn quite a bit about how they work .
Shoot - Out Overview
First we provide a summary of the Graphical Data from Part I and Part IV , next a comprehensive point - for - point color coded Comparison Table , and then finish with Suggestions and Conclusions for Google and Motorola .

Suggestions and Conclusions :
Below are the suggestions and conclusions for the Nexus One and Motorola Droid from Parts I and IV .
DisplayMate Technologies specializes in advanced mathematical display optimizations and precision quantitative and analytical scientific display factory calibrations to deliver outstanding image and picture quality and accuracy while increasing the effective visual Contrast Ratio of the panel and producing a higher calibrated brightness than is achievable with traditional calibration methods .
We can also make lower cost displays look almost as good as more expensive higher performance panels .
These articles are a brief introductory critical analysis .
Our optimizations correct these deficiencies and much more .
If you are a display or product manufacturer and want to turn a standard panel into a spectacular one Contact DisplayMate Technologies to learn more .
Suggestions for Google :
1. Eliminate the primitive 16 - bit display interface and fix the Browser , Gallery and other applications .
2 . The White Point is too blue , lower it to D6500 , which will improve color accuracy , slow the aging of the Blue OLED , reduce power consumption , and improve battery run time .
3 . Improve the factory display calibration to correct the large color and gray - scale tracking errors and the irregular and non-standard display contrast and Gamma .
4 . The color saturation of the display is way too high .
You can trade this excess color saturation to boost the screen brightness by adjusting the software color calibration matrices .
This will also improve the color accuracy of the display .
5 . Take full advantage of the OLED display : the ambient light sensor now just controls the screen brightness .
You should also use it to control the gamma , color gamut , color saturation , and edge enhancement so that in low ambient light the display delivers beautiful and accurate image and picture quality , but as the ambient light increases slowly turn up these parameters to counter - balance the washed out appearance of the images in bright ambient light .
Also add a display Vivid or Pizzazz control because some people prefer punchy images and pictures , while other people do not .
Suggestions for Motorola :
Keep up the good work …
To make your displays even better follow the detailed comments and recommendations above and in greater detail in Part IV .
Also ask Google to fix the poor image rescaling and its 16 - bit implementation in the Browser and possibly other Android OS applications .
Nexus One Conclusion : The Nexus One Display Looks Like a Prototype
The Nexus One OLED display has many spectacular qualities , but it is also loaded with lots of rough edges , hasty unfinished beta display drivers and Android software including principal applications like the Browser and Gallery , poorly implemented image processing , poor system integration together with sub- standard factory display calibration .
It really looks and behaves like a prototype for a very nice future display , not a finished production display for a world class mobile device that Google markets it to be .
It will be interesting to see the degree to which existing units will be corrected and improved with software updates .
Motorola Droid Conclusion : Excellent Mobile Display wins two DisplayMate Best Video Hardware Guide Awards
The Motorola Droid is an excellent mobile display with just a few comparatively minor shortcomings .
In terms of image and picture quality it comes closer to a high quality computer monitor or HDTV than any other mobile display we have tested – all the more impressive because mobile displays operate under challenging size , power and cost constraints .
In fact , the image and picture quality and accuracy on the Droid is actually better than in most computer monitors and HDTVs ( but smaller , of course ) .
The screen is very bright and very sharp , has excellent color and gray scale accuracy , and has very good Contrast and readability under both dim and bright ambient light .
For these reasons we have awarded the Motorola Droid the DisplayMate Best Video Hardware Guide Award for both Smartphones and the entire Mobile Display category .

Visiting Houston last week to lead a four - night revival for a local church , Ms. Ukpabio , 41 , had no idea that “ Saving Africa ’s Witch Children , ” which brought protesters out to greet her in London , was about to be shown in the United States .
But she was eager to defend herself .
“ Do you think Harry Potter is real ? ” Ms. Ukpabio asked me angrily , in the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express where she was staying .
“ It is only because I am African , ” she said , that people who understand that J. K. Rowling writes fiction would take literally Ms. Ukpabio ’s filmic depictions of possessed children , gathering by moonlight to devour human flesh .
Still , “ Saving Africa ’s Witch Children ” makes clear that many rural Nigerians do take her film seriously .
And in her sermons , Ms. Ukpabio is emphatic that children can be possessed , and that with her God - given “ powers of discernment , ” she can spot such a child .
Belief in possession is especially common among Pentecostals in Nigeria , where it reinforces native traditions that spirits are real and intervene in human affairs .
In Nigeria , many preachers not only identify possessed children but charge dearly to perform exorcisms .
To redeem their children ’s souls — and to keep the child from being killed or banished by neighbors — parents scrimp or borrow to pay the preacher .
Ms. Ukpabio argued that “ Saving Africa ’s Witch Children ” exaggerates or invents the problem of child abandonment .
Asked how she could be so sure , she said , “ because I am an African ! ”
In Africa , she said , “ family ties are too strong to have a child on the street . ”

NEW DELHI , India —
Not long ago , women in the small south Indian town of Coimbatore were convinced that 47 - year - old A. Muruganantham was some kind of pervert .
After a failed attempt with his wife and sisters and a cockeyed do - it - yourself effort with a football bladder full of goat 's blood , he 'd finally hit upon a surefire way to test the low - cost sanitary napkin he was developing for India 's poor .
He was passing out free pads to college girls and collecting their used napkins for study .
And he had a storeroom full of them .
When his mother saw it , she burst into tears and packed her things to move in with his sister .
“ Everybody claimed I am a psycho , [ that ]
I am using this as a trump card to get close to girls , ” said Murugantham , who taught himself English in the course of his research — partly to get past the telephone answering systems he encountered when he called U.S. suppliers .
“ Before going across that automatic , it will cost 300 and 400 rupees .
The moment the operator starts speaking , it will cost 300 and 400 rupees .
Then the person will speak in slang English , ' OK , ' because this is a material that is only used by big companies . ”
Nobody thinks he 's a psycho anymore .
In 2006 , Muruganantham , a high school dropout , perfected a machine for making low - cost sanitary napkins against all odds .
Along the way he'd taught himself English , recruited local college professors to help him draft letters and surf the web for suppliers , worn panties ( not to mention a sanitary pad and a football bladder full of blood ) , and spent many times the cost of his TVS Motors moped on laboratory analyses .
He even invented an alter ego to get past the gatekeepers at the U.S. firms that supplied the pine wood - based cellulose — not cotton — that he discovered was the raw material he needed .
“ The moment they hear that somebody is calling from some remote place , in India , they will ask , ' Who are you ? '
So I said I am a millionaire in Coimbatore .
We are going to start the napkin company , so we want raw materials , ” said Muruganantham .
Eventually , he triumphed .
Capable of producing around 120 pads per hour , the machine Murugantham developed costs only about $ 2,500 — a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that Johnson & Johnson ( J&J ) and Procter & Gamble ( P&G ) spend on their plants .
And while output of 120 pads an hour hardly offers much in the way of economies of scale , Muruganantham 's invention has created its own business model for small “ self help groups ” of low - income women — creating jobs that earn them twice what they made as ordinary laborers .
“ It is an innovative way of addressing the issue of female hygiene and is accessing a market that the Kotex product made by Kimberly - Clark currently does not access , ” said a spokesman for Kimberly - Clark .
But even as Muruganantham has intrigued multinationals , earned accolades from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology ( Madras ) and the National Innovation Foundation and inked a deal with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to supply his machines to women 's self - help groups in Africa , a controversial Indian government scheme threatens to squash his grassroots movement .
According to local newspaper reports , the government is finalizing plans to supply free and “ highly subsidized ” sanitary napkins to India 's poor .
The program is being designed to cover 200 million rural women , using 100 sanitary napkins each per year , at an estimated cost of around $ 450 million .
No details are available yet regarding the supplier , but in India , as in the rest of the world , virtually the only major manufacturers of sanitary napkins are multinationals P&G , J&J and Kimberly - Clark .
“ This is a ' first of kind ' program where public - private partnership is being explored to bring high quality products to rural poor at affordable rates , ” said the Kimberly - Clark spokesman .
“ The proposed model would envisage a complete reworking of the value chain to drive costs down .
The intent is for the project to be self sustainable over a period of time .
The Indian government is in talks with all the major sanitary napkin manufacturers — and nothing is finalized as yet . ”
Muruganantham does n't see it that way .
“ What I am telling is that if the government permits me we are able without subsidy to provide the napkins , ” Murugantham said .
“ Already , we can make napkins for 1 rupee , 50 paise .
If the government comes , we can reduce that by 50 percent . ”
And if the government guarantees orders from rural women , the scheme wo n't cost the state a penny , Murugantham believes .
With orders in hand , the women will be able to get small - business loans from local banks , enabling local entrepreneurs to set up 100,000 manufacturing units across India .
But can a grassroots invention really compete with some of the world 's largest multinational companies ?
Because of poverty and social stigmas surrounding menstruation , today , most Indian women use rags or even scraps of gunny sack instead of modern sanitary napkins — which are unavailable or too costly .
For the government , this represents a public health crisis , raising the likelihood that millions of women will suffer reproductive tract infections or even cervical cancer .
And for the big napkin makers , it represents a huge , untapped market that promises to keep the business growing for decades .
“ Realizing the huge business potential of converting the homemade napkin users to branded napkins , ” J&J launched its Stayfree Secure brand in India in 1997 , and the low - cost product was the largest selling sanitary napkin in the Indian market within four years , according to the company 's web site .
Riding on its
Whisper brand , first launched here in 1989 , P&G 's feminine hygiene division notched growth of 26 percent last year , according to the company 's annual report , generating sales of around $ 100 million .
The future lies in cracking the market comprising the urban and rural poor .
Describing a partnership with the National Rural Health Mission ( NRHM ) to teach rural women of Rajasthan about reproductive health — now set to be expanded in Muruganantham 's home state of Tamil Nadu — P&G 's annual report concludes , “ Significantly , the program has been able to convert 85 percent of cloth users to sanitary pad users who used WHISPER . ”
" P&G and Johnson and Johnson look at this issue merely in terms of sales turnover , ” said PC Vinoj Kumar , a crusading journalist .
“ But as a social entrepreneur Muruganantham 's business model has socio-economic objectives .
It creates employment for thousands of rural women , apart from promoting use of sanitary napkins . ”
One of the first to discover Muruganantham 's invention , Kumar recently launched a Facebook campaign against the government 's plan to subsidize sanitary napkins , which he suspects will be sourced from one of the three multinationals that control the world market .
In March , one of his campaigners filed a Right to Information ( RTI ) request seeking “ copies of all files related to this scheme right from the initiation of the scheme , to any consultations held with any external agencies , the basis on which the scheme was announced and any other relevant details . ”
But according to Kumar , the government 's reply simply stated the obvious : “ This is to inform you that currently the Ministry , Health & Family Welfare does not have a scheme to provide free sanitary napkins for women living below poverty line .
Further , discussions for formulation of the same as well as an assessment of various modalities is taking place in the ministry , after which , the scheme would be proposed . ”
In case you 're not fluent in the lingo , that 's bureaucratese for buzz off :
The ministry provided none of the files related to the plan or any other details requested under India 's RTI law .
Now Kumar plans a letter - writing campaign to approach the president , the prime minister , the health minister and the finance minister and ask them to consider Muruganantham 's proposal before finalizing the free sanitary napkin scheme .
Meanwhile , Murugantham 's not standing still .
His napkin machines are already in place in more than 200 locations across India , where they are empowering local women , and taking the stigma away from menstruation and feminine hygiene by turning it into a lucrative trade .
Though many have flourished , some self - help groups have floundered without management expertise — raising doubts whether a legion of grassroots organizations could truly handle the mammoth job of supplying sanitary napkins to the country .
But Murugantham argues that if the government supports him instead of P&G or J&J , his machines cannot only solve India 's feminine hygiene crisis but also provide employment for a million women .
That 's radical thinking from the bottom of the pyramid .
The question is :
Will the government squash it and make a mockery of the much ballyhooed “ decade of innovation ? ”
Featuring a roof - mounted racetrack outside and 56 separate bars inside , the 708,661 square - foot Autopia Europia in Istanbul , Turkey will be the largest car dealership in the world .
It 's currently under construction , but here 's a peek at the automotive wonder .

As you can expect , its designers do n't envision Autopia Europia as a car dealership , but rather a car mall featuring 200 individual showrooms , 48 service stations , 42 insurance companies and 24 banks .
Over 400 brands ( we did n't realize there were that many ) , will be represented with 2,426 models .
All areas of the mall will be accessible by car .

Rather than racing , the rooftop track is expected to be used for new car test drives , free from the traffic the 6 million annual visitors are expected to create on the surrounding roads .

Good luck , NFL teams .
May Sam Bradford and Jimmy Clausen not turn into Ryan Leaf .
Of the 4,625,918 people with a sports column or sports blog , I am the only one who has n't written an NFL mock draft before .
How is that possible ?
I love mock drafts !
What 's more in my wheelhouse than a column filled with a ton of hyperbole , opinions that can't be proved and , of course , a lot of mocking ?
I allowed nine NFL drafts to sneak by me at ESPN.com like a hanging slider ; this will not be the 10th .
Let 's get it on .
1. St. Louis
Sam Bradford , QB
I guess I 'm confused .
When Ndamukong
Suh left a trail of bodies at Nebraska last season , everyone agreed , " That dude is a wrecking machine , he 's definitely the No. 1 pick . "
Then , the season ended and everyone started picking Suh apart .
He turned 23 in January .
The track record of defensive tackles going first overall is n't great .
I 'm not so sure Gerald McCoy is n't better .
You gotta grab a franchise QB here if you can get one .
As soon as Bradford 's shoulder received a clean bill of health , momentum swung behind him because , you know , any time you can take someone first in a draft when everyone agrees he is n't one of the best two players , you have to do it .
There is no talking the Rams out of this one :
The new owners want a poster boy for their new regime ; their beaten - down fans need a Hope Vessel , and there 's no better way to feed that beast than grabbing a good - looking QB with a Hollywood - ready name like " Sam Bradford . "
It 's probably the right pick .
Hit a draft - day home run with a quarterback and it's a grand slam .
Hit a draft - day home run with any other position and it's a home run .
I just know that three levels of " franchise quarterbacks " have been taken in the top three picks since 1998 :
Level 1 ( no way they were missing ) : Peyton Manning ( 1 ) , Michael Vick ( 1 ) .
Level 2 ( almost definitely were n't missing ) : Carson Palmer ( 1 ) , Eli Manning ( 1 ) .
Level 3 ( hopefully were n't missing ) : David Carr ( 1 ) , Tim Couch ( 1 ) , Alex Smith ( 1 ) , JaMarcus Russell ( 1 ) , Matthew Stafford ( 1 ) , Ryan Leaf ( 2 ) , Donovan McNabb ( 2 ) , Akili Smith ( 3 ) , Joey Harrington ( 3 ) , Vince Young ( 3 ) , Matt Ryan ( 3 ) .
At the time , you would have bet your life on the Level 1 guys making it ( barring injury ) .
You would n't have bet your life on the Level 2 guys , but you would have at least asked for odds .
You would not have wagered your life on any of the Level 3 guys .
Three made it ; seven bombed ; and Young gets an incomplete .
If anything , getting picked that high set those guys up for failure : Expectations skyrocketed ; their teams felt obligated to play them before they were ready ; and they were asked to do too much too soon .
The experts believe Bradford is a Level 2 guy , although it 's worth noting that he qualifies -- potentially -- under everything in the previous sentence .
Digging deeper , let 's say the NFL pressed the reset button , made every QB a free agent , then held a QB lottery for the 32 teams .
The top 12 order of preference would look something like this : Peyton Manning ( picked first overall ) ; Tom Brady ( sixth round ) ; Drew Brees ( second round ) ; Philip Rivers ( fourth overall ) ; Aaron Rodgers ( 24th overall ) ; Ben Roethlisberger ( 11th overall ) ; Mark Sanchez ( fifth overall ) ; Matt Ryan ( third overall ) ; Eli Manning ( first overall ) ; Tony Romo ( undrafted ) ; Joe Flacco ( 18th overall ) ; Matt Schaub ( third round ) .
Translation : Drafting QBs is a freaking crapshoot .
You 're throwing dice .
If you miss with a top - 3 pick , it 's a catastrophe because of the financial hit and the seasons squandered trying to make a bad situation work .
( See : Russell , JaMarcus . )
The six teams that misfired on Carr , Couch , Leaf , Harrington and the Smiths failed to win a playoff game for at least SIX STRAIGHT YEARS after whiffing on those picks ; all six picked in the top 3 of another draft within three years of the whiff ; and the seventh team ( Oakland ) has missed three straight postseasons since whiffing on Russell .
So based on the last 12 years of evidence , it 's just as likely that Bradford will murder the Rams as save them .
Of course , you could have said the same thing about Matthew Stafford last spring and he made it .
That 's why St. Louis will take Bradford .
Just do n't tell me it's a " safe pick " because it 's not .
The next guy is the safe pick .
2. Detroit
Ndamukong Suh , DT
Gives the Lions franchise guys on both sides of the ball , and that 's before we get to Suh 's character ( Did you catch this story about his $ 2.6 million donation to Nebraska ) ?
Are they definitely taking him ?
Of course not !
They 're reportedly open to trading down .
Just take the dude already .
We want to watch a good Detroit game on Thanksgiving before we die .
By the way , my Dad would like to announce that he 'll be calling this guy " Suh " on Thursday night .
3. Tampa Bay
Gerald McCoy , DT
One of those picks that makes you wish they did the NFL draft like we would -- with 32 GMs crammed around a long table , magazines and cheat sheets strewn everywhere , the Bucs taking their sweet time at No. 3 , and a couple of the other GMs finally getting pissed and saying , " Come on , we all know you 're taking McCoy , he 's the best pick by far ; I do n't want to be here until 2 in the morning .
JUST EFFING TAKE HIM ! "
4. Washington
TRADE !
Washington wants a left tackle to protect McNabb .
Picking next , Kansas City does n't need a left tackle which means Russell Okung or Trent Williams could be there at No. 7 a spot where Cleveland wants a playmaker on defense .
Do I need to spell this out for you ?
Cleveland trades No. 7 , No. 85 and No. 92 to Washington for No. 4 and No. 103 .
4. Cleveland
Eric Berry , S
One of many things that bugs me about the NFL draft : Everyone , and I mean , EVERYONE , agrees that Eric Berry is ( A ) one of four no - doubt - abouters in this draft ; ( B ) quite possibly " The Next Ed Reed " ; and ( C ) someone who passes the Champ Bailey Test -- in other words , just glancing at his name makes you think , " That 's a guy who sounds like he 's gonna be good . "
So why would n't Berry go fourth ?
Because the moronic rookie salary structure severely overvalues the top - 10 picks , so teams worry that top - 5 is too expensive for a free safety .
Here 's my counter :
You 're getting a multiyear All - Pro !
Who cares ???
Reed went 24th in the 2002 draft ; if you did that first round over again , Dwight Freeney goes first , Julius Peppers goes second , Albert Haynesworth goes third and Reed goes fourth .
If you asked Baltimore whether Reed was worth No. 4 cap money from 2002 to 2007 , I 'd bet my baseball card collection the Ravens would say yes .
Berry should go fourth .
5. Kansas City
TRADE !
Follow this formula : ( No obvious pick ) +
( Belichick disciple Scott Pioli running the show ) = a Bizarro Jeffersons move ( " We 're movin ' on down ! " ) .
Washington trades No. 7 and No. 92 to Kansas City for No. 5 .
5. Washington ( via fake trade )
Trent Williams , OT
That was fun :
The Redskins made two trades , jumped 18 spots in the third round and landed their tackle at a slightly lower cap spot .
Williams gets the edge over Russell Okung only because he has gained momentum in the past few weeks .
The good news for Okung : Even if he is n't the top tackle drafted , he still gets his own all - star team : the Russell Okung All - Stars for " Athletes who sound like they might be Asian even though they are n't . "
6. Seattle
Russell Okung , LT
On Monday's B.S. Report , Mike Lombardi compared this spot to playing pool : The Seahawks also pick 14th , so they want to make this " shot , " then have the cue ball bounce to a spot where they 'll have another easy shot .
This analogy works splendidly unless it 's 2 a.m. and you have some chain - smoking drunk dude trying to pull it off .
And I guess what I 'm trying to say is this : Pete Carroll might be the chain - smoking drunk dude .
I found it perplexing that Seattle handed the coaching / front - office car keys to Carroll this past winter for two reasons .
First , it 's always weird when NFL teams pay huge money to lure successful college coaches when the jobs are so fundamentally different .
It 's the distant cousin of Hollywood 's allowing star actors to direct ( with a similar track record of success ) .
So you excelled at a job that 's 75 percent recruiting and 25 percent strategy , you 've been basically playing the " Pro " level of " Madden " and now we 're asking you to jump to " All - Madden " without a safety net , and you have no feel for the other 31 NFL rosters because you have n't been following our league at all .
This should work great !
Second , Carroll became the Patriots ' coach the same year I launched my www.bostonsportsguy.com website .
He did such a dreadful job that a reader once e-mailed me , " Pete Carroll answers the question of why Fredo was never given control of the Corleone family , " followed by my immediately nicknaming Carroll " Coach Fredo " for the rest of his tenure .
As it turned out , the comparison was an insult to Fredo .
It took Carroll two years to destroy a Super Bowl team , and after he left , it took the Patriots two years to win a Super Bowl .
You could n't do worse .
Even Fredo has " banged two cocktail waitresses " on his résumé .
Now , this was a good 10 - plus years ago , and I was smoking a ton of pot back then , but I specifically remember thinking to myself in 1999 , " Pete Carroll is definitely not meant to coach professional football or pick the players . "
I did n't think Carroll was meant to coach football , period .
His USC experience revealed that he 's meant to recruit 18 - year - olds , hop around on the sideline , pump his fists , do the rah - rah routine , design fun defenses and give likable news conferences .
We already saw this routine in the NFL : His name was Herm Edwards .
It 's not going to work .
Back to the billiards analogy : Seattle probably can't pass on C.J. Spiller ( the only elite running back in the draft ) here and get him at 14 , but the Seahawks can't take him here because they 'd lose out on an elite offensive lineman .
I say take Okung , then move up from No. 14 for Spiller .
We 'll see whether Fredo has it in him .
Er , Pete .
7. Kansas City ( via fake trade )
Bryan Bulaga , OT
Solid pick .
Although here 's the hierarchy of letdown on first - round picks for fans
A. Trading down .
Like a kick in the teeth every time .
It 's like being super excited for a lamb stew dinner , sitting down at the table , then having your wife / mother say , " Sorry , I miscalculated , it 's gonna be another hour . "
Such a letdown .
What 's funny is that , when your team trades up , it 's the complete opposite and seems 10 times more exciting than it actually is .
What ?
We traded up ?
We 're on the clock ?
Who can we get ?
I love trading up .
B. Picking an offensive lineman who is n't a left tackle .
C. Picking a blocking tight end .
D. Picking a QB when you already have a QB .
E. Any No. 1 pick made by the Raiders if you 're a Raiders fan .
Which reminds me
8. Oakland
Dan Williams , DT
The real shame :
If the Raiders had n't already dumped their 2011 No. 1 pick for Richard Seymour , they could have offered two No. 1s to Pittsburgh for Ben Roethlisberger , who immediately would have become the most perfect Raider since Ken Stabler .
Oh , like the Oakland fans would have judged him ?
Come on .
JUST WIN , BABY !
Quick tangent : I 'm fascinated by the Roethlisberger situation .
If anyone was ever set up to cut bait with him , it 's a family - owned franchise in a blue - collar city that already rode him to two Super Bowl wins .
We allegedly have a guy who sought out a drunk girl , had a bodyguard / personal assistant run interference for him , and took the girl alone into a bathroom while her friends tried to , for lack of a better word , save her because they knew she was blitzed .
Now Pittsburgh fans are being asked to forgive this person even though ( A ) they do n't know exactly how badly he behaved , and ( B ) they are n't sure whether this was the first time .
Many are having trouble with this request .
Look , nobody wants to win THAT badly unless you have n't won in a long time , then you can talk yourself into just about anything .
Steelers fans do n't need him anymore .
He 's like a prize camel that already walked them across the desert twice .
At the same time , Pittsburgh is trying to remain competitive , so it can't trade him without a fair deal -- maybe you do n't have to Godfather Offer them like TBS Godfathered Conan O'Brien , but you 'd better pony up something -- and the Steelers would never trade him within their division or to another AFC contender .
Here 's the question :
What cities need a QB , have the assets for a trade and qualify for the aforementioned " nobody wants to win THAT badly unless you have n't won in a long time , then you can talk yourself into just about anything " statement ?
According to my calculations , Buffalo , Kansas City , Oakland and San Francisco .
That 's it .
I do n't think San Fran and K.C. would gut their teams for him .
The Bills do n't work because they could never put a good enough team around him , and if he ever slipped up again , they would never recover .
That leaves Oakland .
We already know Al Davis is starstruck ; we know he loves gunslinger QBs ; we know he loves to get people talking ; we know he does n't care about the future because he died four years ago ; and we know he could n't care less about someone 's background or character .
In other words , he 's a perfect match .
So what if Al offered Pittsburgh the No. 8 pick and a No. 1 pick in 2012 ?
Would n't the Steelers have to do it ?
If you 're Al Davis , and you died four years ago would n't you have to do it ?
If you 're Roethlisberger , would n't you want a fresh start somewhere else ?
Stay tuned .
I have no inside info whatsoever , and I made this whole thing up three minutes ago , but stay tuned .
9. Buffalo
Anthony Davis , OT
Ca n't take Jimmy Clausen here -- putting a young QB behind a bad line on a bad team in bad weather for a bad coach would n't be fair .
I do not approve .
Speaking of Buffalo , the 2010 Bills brain trust consists of a 91 - year - old owner , a 70 - year - old general manager who 's never been a GM before and a 58 - year - old coach who has only two years of NFL head coaching on his résumé .
Or , as some people call it , The Dream Team !
10 . Jacksonville
TRADE !
The Jags can absolutely talk Pete Carroll into a " Look , if you do n't trade up for C.J. Spiller right now , we 're trading this pick to someone who will " scenario , right ?
Although part of me wants Carroll to abandon the Spiller chase , trade for Matt Leinart and sign Reggie Bush , just because it would be fun to have that trio back together , only this time , Leinart and Bush would be getting paid OVER the table .
( The UCLA fans are giggling right now . )
Screw it , let 's give Seattle Spiller .
Seattle trades No. 14 , No. 60 and No. 127 to Jacksonville for No. 10 , No. 74 and No. 143 .
10 . Seattle ( via fake trade )
C.J. Spiller , RB
My only concern :
It worries me whenever a draft pick ( in this case , Spiller ) looks so enticing partly because it's a weak year at his position .
It 's the distant cousin of Press Box Hot -- how there can be one female reporter in a press box full of dudes , and unless she has a mustache or looks like Babe Ruth , they 're always going to salivate over her .
This does n't necessarily mean she 's attractive , right ?
As recently as last month , Mel Kiper and Todd McShay did their Mock Draft 3.0 and pegged Spiller at 19th and 14th , respectively .
Now some people have him going as high as sixth -- which , extending the Press Box Hot dynamic , means we have talked ourselves into thinking he was " hot " instead of " cute . "
He might be hot , he might be cute .
I do n't know .
I just know that I do n't totally trust this pick .
11 . Denver
Rolando McClain , ILB
Thought it was funny that so many mocks had troubled receiver Dez Bryant pegged in this spot just one week after the Broncos traded Brandon Marshall .
Come on .
When Sandra Bullock dates again -- and Lord knows if she ever will -- I guarantee she wo n't end up with another tattooed TV star who owns a bike shop and used to be married to a porn star .
That 's right , I just mocked the mocks that have Bryant going here .
12 . Miami
Derrick Morgan , DE
Best pass - rusher available , nice fit for their 3 - 4 scheme .
Yup , it 's super easy to sound as if you know what you 're talking about in an NFL mock draft .
( Unrelated , and only because it's an easy chance to extend my " consecutive columns that reference ' Lost ' " streak to six : I liked Miami's Brandon Marshall trade .
He 's petrifying .
The thought of the Patriots playing him twice a year with our usual slew of 5 - foot - 6 corners makes me physically ill .
At the same time , let 's assume that South Beach is like the island in " Lost " and that it brings outsiders to the * island * just because it 's their destiny to live there and get in trouble .
Under that pretense , would n't South Beach rig the 2008 NBA draft lottery so the Heat would get Michael Beasley ?
Would n't it brainwash the Dolphins into giving up $ 47 million and two second - rounders for Brandon Marshall ?
And would n't Roethlisberger be next on deck ? )
13 . San Francisco
Kyle Wilson , CB
Yet another billiards pick allows the 49ers to grab the best corner now , then make another need pick at 17 and pass on Jimmy Clausen twice just one month after passing on McNabb .
You know , because they 're totally set at QB with Alex Smith , who ranked 29th , 24th , 28th and 25th in footballoutsiders .
com 's four advanced QB metrics last season .
This will not end well .
14 . Jacksonville
TRADE !
We need the Jags to keep moving down so they can take Tim Tebow without everyone in the audience laughing hysterically .
So
Philly trades No. 24 and No. 70 to Jacksonville for No. 14 .
14 . Philadelphia ( via fake trade )
Earl Thomas , S
Philly uses two of its excess picks ( six in the top 105 ) to grab an impact player on defense , setting the Eagles up even better for the phenomenal Ewing Theory season that lies ahead .
Drew Bledsoe , Tiki Barber , Donovan McNabb these things come in threes .
15 . N.Y .
Giants
Mike Iupati , G
My Giants friends are freaking out that their team can't tackle anymore ; all of them want the G - Men to trade up to 11 for McClain .
I would urge them to calm down , remember that they won a Super Bowl two years ago because a special - teamer caught the biggest pass of the game off the top of his helmet , then remember we live in a world where Tiki Barber missed a Super Bowl ring by one year , bombed as a TV personality , dumped his pregnant wife for a college coed , had the tri-state area turn against him and is inevitably headed for a job interviewing wrestlers backstage on " Monday Night Raw . "
You 're still playing with house money , Giants fans .
Do n't forget this .
( By the way , Vegas wo n't take odds on the words " The New York Giants select Mike Iupati , guard , Idaho " being followed by this word : " Booooooooooooooooooooo ! " )
16 . Tennessee
Jason Pierre - Paul , DE
Fun moment on my NFL draft preview podcast : Lombardi ( the old - school former GM who studies tape ) absolutely loved Pierre - Paul 's potential , then Aaron Schatz ( the head of www.footballoutsiders.com) came on and introduced his new SackSEER formula for evaluating speed rushers , which , of course , absolutely despised Pierre - Paul .
Now I 'm thinking ESPN needs a weekly show called " You Make My Skin Crawl , " with old - school scouts / executives arguing with sabermetricians about a variety of sports topics and never agreeing on anything .
Not only would I watch this show , I want to host it .
17 . San Francisco
TRADE !
I want to experience the following moment in print because it's never gonna happen in real life ( only because the Patriots love trading down , not up )
New England trades No. 22 , No. 117 and No. 171 to San Francisco for No. 17 .
17 . New England ( via fake trade )
Dez Bryant , WR
Scouts Inc. gave Bryant a 4 out of 5 ( with 5 the lowest grade possible ) for intangibles and wrote , " The NCAA suspended Bryant for the final 10 games of the 2009 season for lying to an NCAA investigator who was looking into Bryant 's offseason meeting with former NFL player Deion Sanders .
Multiple NFL scouts have told us that Bryant comes from a difficult home situation and as a result comes with some emotional baggage . "
And you know what ?
I do n't care .
TOM BRADY NEEDS TOYS !
If the Pats grabbed Bryant here , then landed an explosive running back with one of their three Round 2 picks ( Jahvid Best ) , I 'd be doing backflips .
OK , not really .
I 'm too old .
But there definitely would be some fist pumping along the lines of the Shake Weight commercial .
18 . Pittsburgh
Maurkice Pouncey , C
The Steelers nail the draft 's best center and one of those guys everyone agrees will be really good and yet , by rule , ca n't be taken in the top 12 .
Huh ?
Next year , Pittsburgh can pick his identical twin brother and try to get a Sedin brothers type thing going .
By the way , how fun would a Clausen pick be here ?
That would get a Hall of Fame " Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh " from the New York crowd , would n't it ?
19 . Atlanta
Brandon Graham , DE
The old , " Holy crap did we screw up three years ago with Jamaal Anderson , let 's just take a mulligan " pick .
I love those .
20 . Houston
Joe Haden , CB
Followed by one of the ESPN guys saying , " When you 're playing Peyton Manning twice a year , you can NEVER have enough CORNERBACKS ! "
21 . Cincinnati
Jermaine Gresham , TE
The Bengals have needed a tight end ever since Reggie Kelly blew out his knee on " Hard Knocks . "
Which reminds me , I 'm so excited for " Hard Knocks : The New York Jets " that I can barely stand it .
Rex Ryan coming off gastric bypass surgery and saying Rex Ryan things ?
LaDainian Tomlinson slowly making Jets fans forget he 's washed up by giving a series of intense interviews and looking good in cone drills ?
Santonio Holmes possibly playing the " Why did Pittsburgh get rid of me but keep Roethlisberger is it because I'm BLACK ? " card ?
Woody Johnson doing Woody Johnson things ?
Braylon Edwards dropping pass after pass as the coaches say , " It 's OK , Braylon , keep your head up ! "
Visits from any of Antonio Cromartie 's seven kids ?
Vernon Gholston becoming the first top - six pick to get cut during a " Hard Knocks " episode ?
Any shots of Mark Sanchez 's girlfriend , if he has one ?
( Note : In a " Which ' Hard Knocks ' team would you want for 2010 ? " fantasy draft , my board would have looked like this : [ 1 ]
Jets ; [ 2 ]
Redskins ; [ 3 ]
Vikings ; [ 4 ]
Seahawks .
So this is good . )
22 . San Francisco ( via fake trade )
Charles Brown , OT
Need pick !
Time for my second - to - last tangent
I hate that Round 1 was moved to Thursday night for selfish reasons :
We do n't need more to watch / do on the last Thursday of April .
There 's NBA playoffs , NHL playoffs , the end of college semesters , final exams , spring weather , baseball games , TV programming heading toward May sweeps ( like " Survivor " ) we already have too much going on .
The NFL draft is like a killer bottle of wine .
You do n't want to chug it ; you want to savor it .
You want to swirl it around in your glass , smell it , sip it , discuss it , throw yourself into it .
By putting the draft on Thursday night , now it 's just another liquor option behind the bar .
I think it 's better than that .
So here 's my suggestion :
Move the draft back three weeks .
Make it the first Thursday in April so it misses the NBA playoffs , the NHL playoffs and the Masters .
We want to savor this thing .
Besides , why do they wait so long to have the NFL draft ?
The NBA and NHL bang theirs out right after the season ; really , the NFL needs three months to figure out their picks that have a 50 percent success rate no matter what happens ?
I vote for the first Thursday in April .
Throw us a bone .
23 . Green Bay
Kareem Jackson , CB
Need pick !
Last tangent : I think Roger Goodell should wear a cowboy hat during Thursday 's draft to officially complete his transformation into Timothy Olyphant in " Justified . "
Just let it go , Roger .
You 're feeling it .
You love being the new sheriff in town and handing out vague suspensions for things like , " Even though they did n't press charges , you can't tell me that something did n't happen in that seedy bathroom with that college girl , so here 's a six - game suspension and you 're lucky it 's not worse . "
Wear the cowboy hat .
Send a message .
24 . Jacksonville ( via fake trade )
Tim Tebow , QB
And it 's time .
I 've never been a big " gotta take the local hero " guy .
You know what sells tickets ?
Winning .
But Tim Tebow is n't just a local hero .
He 's a local demigod .
He 's the most popular person in Florida .
He would immediately transform the Jaguars from " The team that 's probably moving " to " Florida 's official pro football team . "
This has to be the move for them .
It 's just smart business .
I mean have you been to Jacksonville ?
Not a lot going on .
To say the least .
If the Tebow thing worked out , that saves the franchise and legitimizes the ( not so fun to visit , believe me , I spent a week there once ) city of Jacksonville .
In the St. Louis / Bradford section , I wrote that it 's " just as likely that Bradford will murder the Rams as save them . "
Same goes for Tebow in Jacksonville .
But here 's the big difference :
You 're picking him 24th instead of first .
Give me home run odds on a $ 500 craps bet ( like Bradford ) and I 'm nervous .
Give me home run odds on a $ 20 craps bet ( like Tebow ) and I 'm giddy .
Tim Tebow should be a Jacksonville Jaguar .
Just not at No. 10 .
Because that would be dumb .
Zooming through the last eight picks because I 'm throwing crap against the wall at this point

In this guest post , Shreen Ayob sets out the situation facing Bita Ghaedi and how to help stop the UK government ’s dangerous plan to deport her
An oft used excuse for apathy is confusion , unknown facts and vague issues .
This story has none of those , and I urge you to take action .
Bita Ghaedi ’s story is simple .
She fled to the UK to escape an unhappy and abusive family situation , as well as an unhappy marriage .
The Home Office denied Bita Ghaedi ’s first application for asylum in 2007 .
In response , she made an unsuccessful suicide attempt .
In the years that passed , Bita feared being sent back to Iran at any time .
She is subsequently suffering from intense , relentless stress which according to her current partner ( a prominent member of the Iranian opposition ) , has turned her hair white .
She also became involved in activism with the People ’s Mujahedin of Iran ( PMOI ) .
Not only is it a very real threat that her family ( brother , father , husband and other male relatives ) may try to kill her for so - called ‘ honour ’ reasons , but her political associations with the PMOI put her at even more risk if she is deported .
Bita ’s partner Mohsen Zadshir writes : “ The Home Office is determined to send Bita to the hands of Iranian brutal regime .
As you all know , Bita has raised her voice against the fundamentalist Shari’a Law .
She has been interviewed by the satellite TV of Iranian opposition and the footage has been broadcasted all over Iran .
According to the Iranian regime Bita ’s support for the PMOI makes her a ‘ Mohareb ’ – enemy of God , and is punished by death penalty . ”
What the British government are doing to Bita is illegal according to UN guidelines .
The deportation was due on April 20th but was delayed by the Icelandic volcanic ash fiasco .
The new date has been set as May 5th .
Let ’s keep the pressure up on the Home Office to stop this deportation .
Five actions you can take to halt Bita ’s deportation

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A woman left locked alone in a plane asleep for about four hours after landing at Philadelphia International Airport is suing United Airlines .
Ginger McGuire , 36 , is suing for false imprisonment , infliction of emotional distress and negligence , her attorney Geoffrey Fieger told the U.S. newspaper Detroit Free Press .
McGuire fell asleep on a late - night United Express flight from Washington , D.C. , to Philadelphia .
She failed to wake up after the 50 - passenger plane touched down at 12:27 a.m. local time and everyone else disembarked .
A cleaning crew eventually roused her , but she was kept locked in the plane until federal officers were satisfied that she was not a terrorist , said the newspaper .
“ We are working closely with our partner Trans States Airlines to investigate the cause and remedy the situation with the customer , ” United Airlines spokeswoman Sarah Massier told the paper .
No one at the UAL Corp unit was immediately available for comment .
Fieger is a high - profile attorney whose clients have included euthanasia practitioner Jack Kevorkian , and a U.S. soldier who claims the producers of Oscar - winning war movie “ The Hurt Locker ” stole his story .

PS : Yes , the code which generated this report is available .
You 're an ass .
Really , what 's the deal ?
Okay , well , as you might know , H.264 is the codec used in everything from YouTube to Flip cams to HD - DSLRs to Blu-ray , and it's the standard Apple 's backing over Flash for video on the web .
Microsoft and Google are also backing H.264 , but neither is being as militant about Flash .
H.264 is thus a Big Deal -- it 's very likely the future of video on the internet and beyond .
That 's got people all hot and bothered , because depending on how you use H.264 you have to pay license fees to the MPEG - LA , which represents various patent - holders that came together to create the standard .
We 're talking some major industry heavyweights here : in addition to Apple and Microsoft , the H.264 patent roster includes Panasonic , Sony , Dolby , Thomson , and Toshiba -- in all there are 26 companies or organizations listed as holding H.264 patents .
( As an aside , Apple has a single patent in the pool , while Microsoft has around 75 , and Microsoft says it actually pays more in license fees than it collects in royalties . )
Oh , and AT&T also has some patents on MPEG - 4 it wants license fees for , but it 's not part of MPEG - LA , and those rates have to be negotiated separately .
That does n't sound very open .
Did Steve Jobs lie to me ?
There 's a crucial difference between " open " and " free " here .
Although H.264 is an open standard , in that it was developed by a consortium of companies and anyone can make and sell an encoder or decoder , it 's not free -- you 've got to pay for a royalty fee to use it , and the rates are set by the MPEG - LA , which collects payments and distributes them to its members .
The basic rate sheet and license terms are publicly available in summary form ( PDF ) on the MPEG - LA 's website -- it 's certainly possible for companies to strike custom deals , but for our purposes the public document offers a good baseline .
So what are the rates , and who has to pay ?
An excellent question that cuts to the heart of the matter .
Remember , patents cover making , using , and selling the patented technology , so the MPEG - LA actually offers two licenses : one for codec developers ( who make and sell the patented H.264 technology ) and one for video content and service providers ( who use it to distribute H.264 encoded content ) .
The rates vary significantly ; the yearly royalties for distributing an encoder range from free to $ 5 m , while the royalties for distributing for - pay content are subject to complex rules about distribution but also range from free to $ 5 m .
In any event , MPEG - LA has said to us that only the parties at the top and bottom of the H.264 tool chain are generally required to pay royalties ; that is , the party who makes the encoder , and the party who distributes the encoded file to the end users .
You can think of that as the first and last transaction , if you like -- the person who sells the encoder and the person who sells the content are the ones who have to pay .
That ultimately means products that come with an H.264 codec do n't also come with a license to use the codec commercially -- in order to distribute H.264 content in a way that makes money , the distributor has to pay for a separate license .
So products like Windows 7 , Mac OS X , Final Cut Pro , Avid , and modern video cameras are n't licensed to distribute video for commercial use -- they all have fine print somewhere that says they 're for personal and non-commercial use only .
It 's language that feels incredibly aggressive and broad , especially since it apparently conflicts with the MPEG - LA 's general position that only the final link in the chain -- the party selling or distributing the video to the end user -- has to pay royalties for using the H.264 encoder .
Ouch .
So people are mad because they have to pay to make and distribute videos for commercial use ?
Using H.264 to distribute free internet video to end users does n't cost a thing , and wo n't cost anything until at least 2015 .
Yes , but it 's not as bad as it seems .
First off , we 've directly asked MPEG - LA whether or not using an H.264 camera simply to shoot video for a commercial purpose requires a license , and the answer is no .
We 've also asked whether an end user watching H.264 videos would ever have to pay or be licensed , and the answer to that question is also no .
Yes , the license terms are worded poorly , but those are the answers straight from the patent horse 's mouth .
Everyone can breathe again , 'kay ?
On top of that , there 's a gigantic exception to the license rules that should put any lingering fears to rest : using H.264 to distribute free internet video to end users does n't cost a thing , and wo n't cost anything until at least 2015 .
After that , it 's up in the air , and that 's a bridge we 'll have to cross when we come to it -- there 's a chance the MPEG - LA could start charging a royalty for free video in five years .
But for right now MPEG - LA president Larry Horn says the group does n't want to " plug a royalty into a business model that 's still unsettled . "
It 's also important to note that the MPEG - LA can't just run off and do whatever it wants ; its decisions are made by the various patent holders it represents , many of whom are also still trying to figure out the economics of video on the web themselves .
Yeah yeah .
Can they sue me or what ?
Even if a license fee for free internet video is required after 2015 , it 's still the apparent provider of the video that 's on the hook for the license , not the content owner or end user -- Google would have to pay the royalty for the YouTube videos it hosts , just Apple now has to pay the fee for the movies it sells through iTunes and DirecTV has to pay for the content it broadcasts .
That 's a huge distinction , and it's one that all of these companies seem comfortable with -- they signed the contracts , after all .
Yes , if you 're a pro and you somehow find yourself selling H.264 videos directly to end users you 'll have to sign a license and potentially pay up , but hey -- if you 're doing that you 're running an actual business and you need to go talk to a real lawyer , not a disembodied third person Q&A on the internet .
To repeat the point : as an end user , you 'll never have to think about your legal liability over H.264 , because there 's no need for you to be licensed unless you 're distributing commercial content to other end users or building an H.264 encoder .
We 'd venture a guess and say you 're probably using a licensed camera and software and uploading to services like YouTube or Vimeo or Viddler , and that means you 're totally in the clear .
Okay , so why all the fuss ?
This seems pretty simple to me .
Well , not really .
This is the internet , where people hate paying for things , and although end users wo n't have to directly pay for H.264 licenses , the very idea of anyone or any company having to pay a license for a video codec has sparked off a firestorm of controversy , most of which is centered around whether or not H.264 is " free " or " open , " and whether or not alternative open - source and royalty - free codecs like Ogg Theora are better for technical , emotional , or moral reasons .
That 's an extremely important and valid debate , but things get messy when you start throwing around terms like " free " and " open " without an understanding of what they specifically mean , and they get even messier when you do n't look at the actual license terms .
And on top of all of that , things get downright heated when you mix in the fact that Apple 's making the biggest push for H.264 , because , well , people get incredibly irrational when it comes to hating or loving Apple .
Damn straight .
But would n't an open - source and royalty - free codec like Ogg Theora actually be better ?
And cheaper ?
Sure it would , and we 'd absolutely love for a free alternative to win out .
But it 's not that simple .
First , many people believe that H.264 is superior to Theora , which is based on the VP3.2 codec released by a company called On2 in 2000 .
Second , it 's also possible that Theora infringes patents held by MPEG - LA members and other codec developers , and that puts whoever uses it at risk of a patent lawsuit -- Larry Horn has flatly said Theora infringes MPEG - LA member patents in recent months .
Nobody knows the answer to that question , since it 's ultimately for the courts to decide , but it injects a healthy amount of fear and uncertainty to the mix , and most businesses tend to shy away from uncertainty -- especially when it 's about potentially massive legal liability .
So the real choice for most companies is to sign up with H.264 and the MPEG - LA in return for a baseline level of legal protection and broad compatibility with a codec that 's been widely adopted in the market , or to go with Theora , save the money upfront and risk a patent lawsuit down the road while shipping a potentially inferior product .
Depending on your point of view , that 's either quite a racket the MPEG - LA 's got going or it's just ruthless tech industry business as usual , but there 's the fundamental situation .
To say that there are a great many smart people out there with passionate viewpoints on either side of this debate would be a tremendously hilarious understatement .
Now , Google actually bought On2 in February , and there 's lots of chatter that it might open - source a codec related to Theora called VP8 at the I/O conference this month , but releasing the source to something does n't erase any potential patent liability , and VP8 would be way behind H.264 in terms of market adoption .
We 're eager to find out what Google has planned , but let 's be straight here : it 's going to take a major , major move for VP8 to have any effect on the H.264 juggernaut .
Let 's agree to call VP8 a big question mark for right now , shall we ?
So why does Firefox support Theora and not H.264 ?
It all goes back to the licensing terms we talked about above -- in order to ship an H.264 decoder with Firefox , Mozilla would have to pay the MPEG - LA something around $ 5 million a year .
That 's not cheap .
Nope .
What 's more , Mozilla remains actively opposed to doing anything that would violate its free - software principles , and shipping code that comes with non-free , non-redistributable license obligations definitely goes against that spirit .
We can totally respect that .
Yeah .
So what to do ?
That 's a rock and a hard place for Mozilla .
For example , Firefox could leverage the H.264 decoders built in to Windows and OS X to play H.264 content without paying the fees , but that gets right back to having content on the web that is n't " free , " and that 's not something Mozilla seems to be interested in supporting .
If H.264 continues to evolve and gain widespread support in the market , Mozilla may eventually have to make an impossible decision between idealism and compatibility , and we 're not even going to try and predict how that one will turn out -- remember , we 're having this H.264 conversation right now because it's in line to replace Flash video , which is arguably even less free and open .
Okay , this all sounds super complicated again .
Well , it sort of is .
But it 's not so complicated that the market can't figure it out -- and since it's not end users who are directly paying here , the market is actually the companies and organizations that have to risk real money and real consequences on their decisions .
And that market is pretty familiar with patent pools : MPEG - 2 has been licensed by the MPEG - LA for 20 years now , while HDMI , WiFi , 2G and 3G cell services , USB , CDs , DVDs , and Blu-ray discs are all standards managed by similar licensing organizations .
We would note at this time none of those arrangements have led to the death of any sort of creativity .
Ke$ha .
Excellent point .
More seriously , it 's obvious the MPEG - LA and its licensees should be clearer with customers about what 's up with commercial licensing and who needs to pay for what .
That hidden personal use fine print feels really sneaky , and pro users need to get some clarity on what 's required of them -- you do n't mess around with people 's livelihoods in the fine print , you know ?
A clarification from the MPEG - LA and some bigger notices at the front of the manuals are needed in short order .
But look , it 's not often Apple , Microsoft , Google , DirecTV , Sony , Toshiba and some 810 other companies all back a standard together .
Barring some insanity -- and we never bar any insanity -- we 'd say H.264 has already won this year 's version of the format war .
You talk a lot .
So when is Engadget going to start offering HTML5 / H.264 videos instead of Flash ?
2200 words later , and you still had to go there , did n't you ?
LOS ANGELES , May 29 ( Reuters ) – Hollywood actor Dennis Hopper , best known for directing and starring in the 1969 cult classic " Easy Rider , " died on Saturday at his home in Venice , California , from complications of prostate cancer , a friend told Reuters .
Hopper was 74 .
The hard - living screen icon died at 8:15 a.m. PDT ( 1515 GMT ) , surrounded by family and friends , said the friend , Alex Hitz .
In a wildly varied career spanning more than 50 years , Hopper appeared alongside his mentor James Dean in " Rebel Without a Cause " and " Giant " in the 1950s and played maniacs in such films as " Apocalypse Now , " " Blue Velvet " and " Speed . "
At the end of 2008 , Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Kin-moon painted a grim picture of the future when he said that the financial crisis – which was just beginning to have a global impact – could lead to social unrest and political instability and could exacerbate many other problems facing humanity .
The UN chief warned that " today 's financial crisis will become tomorrow's human crisis " and that the shockwaves from the financial crash , if not handled properly , could " compound other major threats such as climate change , food insecurity and the terrible persistence of extreme poverty . "
A month later , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the head of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , said that " social unrest may happen in many countries – including advanced economies " if governments failed to adequately respond to the financial crisis .
In May last year , in the midst of the collapse , Robert Zoellick , head of the World Bank , also warned that the global economic crisis could lead to serious social upheaval .
" If we do no take measures , there is a risk of a serious human and social crisis with very serious political implications , " he said .
Greece unrest could provide the spark
Hundreds of thousands of Greeks have taken to the streets to protest the EU - IMF deal
With debt - ridden Greece experiencing periods of strikes , protests and riots , and other governments around the world beginning to feel the anger of societies railing against them , the human crisis of tomorrow that Ban Ki-moon spoke of two years ago looks closer today than at any other time since this current financial crisis - the worst since 1929 - began .
Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have been mobilized across Greece over the past few weeks by left - wing parties and trade unions protesting the austerity measures agreed by the Greek government with the European Union and the IMF .
According to those organizing the protests , Greece is a tinderbox .
" We expect a social explosion some time soon , " Ilias Iliopoulos , secretary general of the Greek public sector union ADEDY , told reporters .
" The possibility of the IMF asking for more measures will trigger this . "
Governments brace for popular revolt as crisis deepens
The situation in Greece is not only making international markets and financially fragile European governments like Spain , Portugal and Italy nervous , but nations all around the world are concerned about rising social discontent over the handling of the crisis .
Spain 's largest union Comisiones Obreras ( CCOO ) has been talking about calling a general strike to protest against the Spanish government ’s planned austerity measures while fears abound that unrest like that seen in Greece may follow .
Thailand has seen the worst violence so far but experts say this level of unrest could happen globally
There have also been recent public demonstrations against perceived government incompetence and financial irresponsibility in Britain , France and Russia , while the ruling elites in Japan , Brazil , Israel , Canada and the United States have all seen protestors take to the streets .
In the Balkans and Eastern Europe , there were large strikes last week in Slovenia , Albania , Croatia , Bulgaria , and Romania – which also saw its largest public protest since the fall of communism .
Thailand , of course , has seen some of the worst violence with banks set on fire , major department stores attacked and protestors staging running battles with armed police and the military .
The protests against the growing divide between rich and poor and the perceived corruption of the government has also led to a number of deaths .
Prolonged crisis stokes fears of global instability
There is a feeling among experts that the deep anger brewing in these countries is fermenting worldwide against the same institutions , the same people , and the failure of global capitalism .
Public discontent is growing in countries across the world as governments struggle to solve the crisis
In the United States , Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair caused a storm when he wrote in a report to the Senate Intelligence Committee that economic crises increase the risk of regime - threatening instability if they are prolonged for a one - or two - year period , adding that the United States would not be immune to the unrest currently being experienced in Europe .
" Instability can loosen the fragile hold that many developing countries have on law and order , which can spill out in dangerous ways into the international community , " he wrote .
" What 's happening in Greece will spread worldwide as economies decline , " Gerald Celente , financial and political trends forecaster and publisher of the Trends Journal , told Deutsche Welle .
" We will see social unrest growing in all nations which are facing sovereign debt crisis , the most obvious being Spain , Ireland , Portugal , Italy , Iceland , the Ukraine , Hungary followed by the United Kingdom and the United States . "
The potential for widespread social unrest in response to the continuing financial crisis has many experts fearing the worst for the world 's current political and social structures with dramatic , perhaps catastrophic , changes ahead .
Continuing unrest could lead to dramatic scenarios
" We could see a rise in power of extreme right governments , secessions of some of the bigger states in the US and more devolution of powers to Scotland , Ulster and Wales in the UK , " Marie - Hélène Caillol , president of the European Laboratory of Political Anticipation , an economic think - tank told Deutsche Welle .
" A similar risk , though in the longer term , exists for China whose growth cannot survive a chaotic evolution in the rest of the world . "
Gerald Celente has an even bleaker , succinct opinion of where the spread of social unrest could lead : " War .
It 's as simple and as horrifying as that . "
Public anger at failing financial and social systems could lead to revoultion , some experts claim
Contrary to some claims that the current wave of unrest is being driven by anarchist and far - left agitators intent on bringing down the global capitalist order , Caillol and Celente believe that its a reaction to a broken system by angry and betrayed citizens of the world .
" Public discontent combined with the lack of centripetal political guidance results in the rise in power of centrifugal forces of all sorts , " said Caillol .
" This crisis is directly connected to the end of the world order as we know it since 1945 – and even earlier since the European colonization process .
Therefore , the whole global fabric centered on the US for 60 years is slowly collapsing , generating turmoil of all sorts . "
" There are no organizations behind this response – it's a public response , " said Celente .
" This is a 21st century rendition of the ' workers of the world unite ' .
The people are fully aware of the enormous bailout going to the ' too big to fail 's ' that they are being forced to pay for .
The higher the taxes go , the more jobs that are lost , the greater the levels of protest . "

NRW - Spitzenkandidatin der Linkspartei für Wikipedia nicht relevant genug
Die Linkspartei in NRW hat derzeit gute Aussichten , bei der kommenden Landtagswahl am 9 .
Mai die 5 % - Hürde zu überspringen .
Die Relevanz - Hürden , welche die Wikipedia dem Informationsbedürfnis ihrer Leser bereitet , scheinen jedoch ungleich schwerer überwindlich , denn speziell die deutsche Version orientiert sich konservativ an Papier - Lexika und zwingt sich bekanntlich in ein Korsett seltsam deutscher Relevanzkriterien .
So wurde denn auch die Spitzenkandidatin der Linkspartei als zu irrelevant angesehen , als dass sich Leser - im Guten wie im Schlechten - über die Politikerin informieren dürfen .
Die effizienteste Manipulation von Medien ist das Verschweigen , was zu selektiver Wahrnehmung führt .
Gerade im politischen Bereich zeichnen sich Medien für ihr Fingerspitzengefühl aus , wenn sie mediale Chancengleichheit mit journalistischer Distanz wahren .
Ausgerechnet das der Form nach in demokratischen Strukturen organisierte Mitmach - Lexikon Wikipedia versagte hier nicht nur selbst , sondern hinderte sogar Dritte an der Anlage eines Artikels über eine Spitzenpolitikerin einer Partei , die bei der letzten Bundestagswahl in NRW über 8 % der Wählerstimmen erhielt und gute Aussichten auf Einzug in den Landtag hat - vielleicht sogar auf eine Regierungsbeteiligung .
Bärbel Beuermann .
Bild : Die Linke NRW
Ein Wikipedia -Benutzer hatte zusammengetragen , was er für wissenswert über Bärbel Beuermann hielt .
Doch sein Beitrag wurde zensiert und er wurde automatisch darauf hingewiesen , dass er eine bereits früher gelöschte Seite erstellt habe .
Einem ( wohl ) weiteren Nutzer mit einer IP , der politische Fairness anmahnte und sich offensichtlich mit dem von Kritikern als " Löschhölle " bezeichneten virtuellen
Ort und den dortigen Gepflogenheiten nicht auskannte , wehte sofort der übliche eisige Wind entgegen .
Ein Benutzer namens " Eingangskontrolle " gab Orchideenbauer schulmeisterlich den Rat " Warte bis nach der Wahl " .
Relevanzkriterien für aussichtsreiche Wahlkandidaten
" Eingangskontrolle " bot in der Löschhölle interessante Einsichten :
So hätte die Kandidatin dann eine Chance auf einen eigenen Wikipedia - Artikel gehabt , wenn sie zuvor Erwähnung im Verfassungsschutzbericht gefunden hätte .
Auch der Bewerber der ( wohl chancenlosen ) Partei " Die Partei " erfreut sich deshalb eines eigenen Artikels , weil er ein bekannter Kriminal - Biologe mit häufiger Medienpräsenz ist .
Frau Beuermann hingegen , über die zwar gelegentlich berichtet wird , kann mit " Dr. Made " natürlich nicht mithalten .
Und gegen die ca. 200 Porno - Darsteller , die von den deutschen Wikipedianern ( im Durchschnitt unter 30 jährige männliche Singles ) für relevant befunden wurden , hat die bislang hochgeschlossen agierende Politikerin keine Chance .
Auch Nico Kern von der Piratenpartei NRW , die aus prinzipiellen Gründen keinen Personenwahlkampf forciert , wird auf Wikipedia - Präsenz verzichten müssen , wenn er nicht bereit ist , sich außerhalb der politischen Bühne zu profilieren .
Gewählte Politiker gelten als relevant .
Doch sollte der Wahl nicht eigentlich eine politische Willensbildung vorausgehen ?
Diese wiederum setzt Kenntnis der wählbaren Kandidaten voraus - ein Zirkelschluss .
Gewählte Politiker genießen also Vorteile gegenüber Newcomern - wie im richtigen Leben , so auch in der Wikipedia - übrigens ein berüchtigter Tummelpatz für Partei - und PR - Strategen jeglicher Couleur .
Nichtberichten ist im PR - Business ein Statement - no news is bad news .
Was wäre der Linkspartei - Kandidatin zu raten , um die Gnade der Gatekeeper zu erfahren ?
Sollte sie sich für den Playboy ausziehen ?
Für den Verfassungsschutzbericht einen Molotowcocktail auf die Staatskanzlei werfen ?
Sich im Container bei RTL - Big Brother einquartieren ?
Eine TV - Kochshow anbieten ( was die gelernte Ernährungsberaterin vermutlich ganz gut könnte ) ?
Fallschirmspringen ?
Einen Clan im E - Sport gründen ?
Drei nationale Fernbuslinien mit eigener Liniengenehmigung unter ihre Kontrolle bringen ?
Kirchliche Heiligsprechung abwarten ?
Eine Ausbildung zum Raumfahrer absolvieren ?
Ein größeres Kriegsschiff werden ?
Eingangskon - Troll
Orchideenbauer und die IP hielten " Eingangskontrolle " offenbar für eine offizielle Instanz , wurden aber darauf hingewiesen , dass es sich nur um einen einfachen Benutzer handele .
Aus gut informierten Kreise hört man jedoch , dass es sich bei " Eingangskontrolle " in Wirklichkeit um eine kollektiv genutzte Sockenpuppe der Admins handeln soll - also einen Gegner , der qua Interessenkonflikt Protektion genießt .
Der Versuch , eine offizielle Stellungnahme zu diesem Vorwurf einzuholen , scheiterte an Unzuständigkeiten .
Kafkas Schloss lässt grüßen .
Die Löschung von Bärbel Beuermann wurde vom Admin stefan64 bestätigt , der zu den derzeit sechs Oversightern gehört , die über die Macht verfügen , das Gedächtnis der Wikipedia zu ändern - selbst den Admins gegenüber .
Das Verdikt der politischen Information über noch nicht gewählte Politiker ist also kein Provinz - Geplänkel im Wiki-Unterholz , sondern quasi offizielle Policy .
Große Schwester
Das Argument , dass es doch eigentlich die Leser sind , deren Informations - Nachfrage über die Relevanz eines Lemmas entscheiden müsste , gilt als irrelevant .
Auch , wenn die Wikipedia im Alltag heute eine hohe praktische Bedeutung genießt , scheint sie vorläufig wohl Selbstzweck einer nicht an Pragmatismus , sondern an konservativer Ordnungsliebe orientierten Community zu sein .
Die Leser sind in der Wikipediawelt unmündig , ebenso Autoren , die von Lesern gewünschte Themen anbieten .
Die Entscheidung darüber , was relevant ist , obliegt der " Großen Schwester " Wikipedia , die wie ihr Bruder weiß , was gut für uns ist .

The company is not a bad barometer of the fast - growing West Bank economy and how , quietly , Prime Minister Salam Fayyad is building the elements and institutions of statehood .
Khoury knows that , as he put it , “ We could wake up one day and all this will be under siege again , ” but he ’s placing his faith in Fayyad ’s “ wise leadership . ”
I asked Khoury what he would say to an Israeli general if he had the chance .
“ I would tell him that Israel is a reality and the Palestinian people are ready to live in peace , ” he said .
“ We are not terrorists but we have the right to resist occupation .
I would say that you are greedy .
You have to give up the West Bank and go back to the 1967 borders , for the sake of Israeli women and children and Palestinian women and children .
Enough is enough . ”
There are Israeli settlements on either side of his village .
Khoury sees one from his window .
Gesturing toward it , he said of the 22 percent of British Mandate Palestine that are the West Bank and Gaza , “ You see , we want this land , not half of it . ”
That is also Fayyad ’s position .
Development is his means to get there .
“ A road , a health care facility , a school — people are beginning to buy into it , ” Fayyad said .
“ There is a sense of self - empowerment . ”
But for now , Palestinian development has to happen in whatever small space is accorded by Israel .
If 6 percent economic growth is to continue , the West Bank must wean itself off massive international aid and become self - sustaining .
But logistics remain a nightmare .
Because of checkpoints , it takes Khoury a day to get his beer into Israel , when Jerusalem is 20 minutes away .
All the beer in kegs has to transit a single checkpoint near Hebron , nearly three hours away .
Bottled beer takes a more direct route , but closures are frequent .
“ The other day it was raining and the Israelis said their dogs could n’t sniff and everything shut down , ” Khoury said .
“ If you complain , ” he continued , “ there ’s just one word — security . ”
Peace is risk , no way around that .
But Israel wo n’t do better than Fayyad .
He ’s a man worth taking risks for .
And if you think the Holy Land could ever be a place where a Jew from Odessa drinks Arab beer in Tel Aviv made by Palestinian entrepreneurs with a joint called Foley ’s in Brookline and a factory in a West Bank village with a church — and thinks nothing of it — then you should get behind Taybeh by paying it a visit .
It ’s the right thing to do .

Warning :
It took Plath less than twelve to boil her head .
The skinny clock hand that creeps around so fox - like
Does n’t care if you made it all the way to the
Platform , just one hair after the last train home
Slips away , slug in a rug , down the chimney tunnel .
And like the cheeky alarm clock that taps its little
Toes all night long , like the fractures that creep
Their way into bingo - playing bones , it ’s coming for you .
While your tea turns to a swamp and your cornflakes
Turn to baby vomit in their bowl , it ’s coming for you .
So kiss me harder next time , because it ’s coming for you
And do n’t let your beer go warm like you have done .
Because it ’s coming for you , and there ’s no way of stopping it .
Benjamin Graham's ' Margin of Safety ' theory suggests stocks are a mediocre buy , but bonds should be avoided at today 's prices .
Correction :
The original version of this article erroneously cited the present value of a 1981 Treasury bond as if interest was compounded at the issued rate ( Treasury bonds pay simple interest ) .
This example has been updated to use a zero- coupon Treasury bond ( first available in mid-1982 ) , that , when purchased at a discount , exhibits the characteristics of compound interest ( in this case , yield to maturity ) .
NEW YORK (
The Street
) --
For all of the complex investment products in the world , a successful retail investor only needs two : a
S&P 500
index fund and U.S. government bonds .
These two investments together provide adequate diversification among equities as well as interest payments and principal guaranteed by the U.S. government .
In
The Intelligent Investor
, Benjamin Graham touted this approach as the best way for an Average Joe to succeed in the market ( Graham 's text pre-dated index funds but suggested holding a diverse basket of 10 to 30 large - cap stocks ) .
Warren Buffett
, Graham 's greatest student , has often recommended that aspiring investors start their research with Graham 's book , specifically : Chapter 20 : " Margin of Safety " as the Central Concept of Investment .
Graham 's " Margin of Safety " principal can be used to confidently guide asset allocation decisions and is easily summarized in two simple points :
Never hold less than 25 % in stocks , and
Judge the attractiveness of stocks vs. bonds by dividing the earnings yield of the stock by the yield of the bond .
To the first point , no investor should ever be fully divested of stocks -- bull markets can last for decades .
Graham 's second point is the financial equivalent of Einstein 's Theory of Relativity ( yet largely ignored by most investors ) .
The earnings yield of a stock is defined as the inverse of the price / earnings ratio ( Example : A stock fund with a P/E of 15 has an earnings yield of 6.67 % ) .
When the earnings yield of a stock fund is two times as great as the yield of a 10 - year Treasury bond , stocks should be considered the better buy ( later in life , Graham considered a ratio of 1.33 times acceptable ) .
When the ratio is less than one time , investors should shun stocks in favor of bonds ( or paying down a mortgage ) .
Had you followed this strategy for the last 100 years , you would have been flashed a warning signal before most stock market panics .
( See chart below . )
Data courtesy of Robert Shiller , Yale Department of Economics .
Interestingly , theoretical data suggests that investors should have avoided the stock market for the better part of the last 30 years -- one of the greatest bull markets in history .
So how would an investor who completely avoided stocks have fared ?
Shockingly well .
Had you been able to purchase $ 10,000 worth of 30 - year zero - coupon Treasury bonds in June 1982 at a yield - to - maturity of 13.91 % ( please note , this is a hypothetical example based on historical interest rates ) , the bonds would be worth nearly $ 500,000 at maturity in 2012 -- even more amazing considering that capital was never put at risk .
Data courtesy of Robert Shiller , Yale Department of Economics .
Sadly , the opportunity to buy government - guaranteed bonds yielding 13.91 % has passed , but investors can still use Graham 's wisdom to prevail in any market conditions .
At current 10 - year interest rates of around 3 % and the
Dow Jones
stuck at 10,000 , the calculated margin of safety ratio sits at around 1.6 , suggesting that stocks are no bargain , but bonds are to be avoided at today 's rates .
In this author 's opinion , an intelligent investor would be wise to hold ample amounts of cash .

Parallellizing the boot in Debian Squeeze - ready for wider testing
These days , the init.d script dependencies in Squeeze are quite complete , so complete that it is actually possible to run all the init.d scripts in parallell based on these dependencies .
If you want to test your Squeeze system , make sure dependency based boot sequencing is enabled , and add this line to /etc / default / rcS :
CONCURRENCY =makefile
That is it .
It will cause sysv-rc to use the startpar tool to run scripts in parallel using the dependency information stored in /etc/ init.d/.depend.boot ,
/etc/init.d/.depend.start and /etc/init.d/.depend.stop to order the scripts .
Startpar is configured to try to start the kdm and gdm scripts as early as possible , and will start the facilities required by kdm or gdm as early as possible to make this happen .
Give it a try , and see if you like the result .
If some services fail to start properly , it is most likely because they have incomplete init.d script dependencies in their startup script ( or some of their dependent scripts have incomplete dependencies ) .
Report bugs and get the package maintainers to fix it . :)
Running scripts in parallel could be the default in Debian when we manage to get the init.d script dependencies complete and correct .
I expect we will get there in Squeeze + 1 , if we get manage to test and fix the remaining issues .
If you report any problems with dependencies in init.d scripts to the BTS , please usertag the report to get it to show up at the list of usertagged bugs related to this .
The Crime and Federalism blog reports on the case of Carlos Alfredo Simon - Timmerman , a New Yorker who was stopped in Puerto Rico last year on his way back from a vacation in Venezuela .
Simon - Timmerman was stopped by U.S. Customs agents , who found a pornographic video in his bag entitled Little Lupe the Innocent ; Do n't Be Fooled By Her Baby Face .
The movie featured Lupe Fuentes , a porn actress who , as the movie title suggests , is a 23 - year - old with a more youthful appearance .
Fuentes is currently under contract with a U.S. porn production company , and has made movies for other U.S. companies in the past .
Those companies are required by federal law to keep records showing that all participants in their adult films are of legal age .
That means Assistant U.S. Attorney Jenifer Yois Hernandez - Vega could have verified Fuentes ' age with as little effort as a Google search and a phone call .
( Hell , she probably could have just consulted one of the porn experts at the Securities and Exchange Commission . )
Instead , the prosecutor pushed ahead with child pornography charges against Simon - Timmerman , even after the man 's attorney was able to show that Fuentes had appeared in movies produced in the U.S. , as well as other documentation that Fuentes was of legal age at the time the movie was made .
Hernandez - Vega still did n't buy it .
Her evidence that Fuentes was a minor was apparently so strong that she not only apparently felt she did n't need to take 15 minutes to look up the proof of Fuentes ' age on file with the federal government , she could also dismiss the evidence produced by Simon - Timmerman 's attorney that his client had n't broken any law — all while keeping Simon - Timmerman locked up for months .
And what was that evidence ?
" Expert " testimony .
At trial , Hernandez - Vega called Alek Pacheco , A U.S. Customs agent and self - described expert in child pornography who concluded ( presumably after viewing the video several times ) that Fuentes was " 13 or 14 " years of age .
The state also called a Dr. Pedro R. Jaunarena who , according to court documents ( PDF ) filed by Hernandez - Vega …
… will explain from viewing the images in question the bodily features he considers in making his determination , such as the face of the minor , the breast area , the genital area to include the existence or non-existence of pubic hair , the height of the minor , among other factors to be considered to establish the approximate age range of the minor depicted and to establish that the relevant images depict minors under the age of eighteen .
Simon - Timmerman 's attorney was even able to get Fuentes to confirm her age over the phone .
That still was n't enough for the prosecutor .
Finally …
Little Lupe herself would have to fly to Puerto Rico , show her passport to the prosecutor , and testify under oath that she was really , really not 13 years old .
" My fans mean everything to me , " Fuentes told Asylum via her publicist .
" It was important to me to make the trip to Puerto Rico to show support to someone who did no wrong . "
That was last month .
After Fuentes ' appearance , Simon - Timmerman was finally released , and the charges against him were dropped .
It took the graciousness of a porn star to keep Simon - Timmerman from going to prison .
If this case follows other clear - cut prosecutorial abuse cases , Hernandez - Vega will suffer little if any penalty for her stunning incompetence , which caused the arrest and months - long incarceration of an innocent man .
And Jaunarena and Pacheco will continue testifying as experts in federal courtrooms , despite the fact that their expertise in this case was off by by about five years .

Many different factors contributed to lower taxes for 2009 .
Tax cuts , less sales tax , stimulus tax breaks and changes in income , which are probably a reflection from the unemployment .
This phenomenon is surely something both parties will jump on because the reasons taxes were so low for 2009 is n't completely because the government is giving everyone a break .
Still , stimulus packages for new homeowners and married couples did help .
High unemployment of course , means less people working and less people paying taxes , which contributed .
The occurrence is a positive in our rough times when attacks from all angles toward government spending and movements do everything possible to be against anything positive in the U.S. system .
" The idea that taxes are high right now is pretty much nuts , " stated Michael Ettlinger in USA Today , head of economic policy at the liberal Center for American Progress .

( Reuters ) - Thirteen killed in crime wave at Mexico ’s Acapulco
Thirteen people were killed in and around the Mexican beach resort of Acapulco early on Saturday in apparent drug - related violence , with four victims found beheaded , security officials said .
WORLD
Five of those killed were police officers whose night - time patrol was attacked by gunmen on the outskirts of Acapulco , a Pacific Ocean resort popular with tourists , the security officials said in a statement .
The bullet - riddled bodies of eight other men were discovered in different areas around Acapulco , and four of them had been beheaded , the officials added .
One of the reasons alcohol prohibition was repealed in the US was the public became fed up with stories just like this .
How many more innocent people must die before we learn the same lesson : that drug prohibition does not decrease addiction or crime ?
The reason for drug prohibition was to protect innocent lives , and yet here again drug prohibition results in the murder of innocent people .
Just as banning pizza would not cause the nation to loose weight because there would still be plenty of other ways to get fat , ending drug prohibition will not lead to an increase in addicts .
It will just give those with addiction problems more ways to destroy their lives .
Those seeking to escape from reality will always find something that is n’t in their best interest to fulfill their desire .
There has been , and always will be , a certain percent of the population that has a propensity to become addicted to something .
There are people who do not touch alcohol even though its legal , because they see it as a harm to their lives .
These same people wo n’t be rushing out to buy illicit drugs once they become legal .
If drug prohibition were ended , there are those that would prefer one addictive drug to another .
They would switch from alcohol to a drug , but the number of addicts would basically stay the same .
How many more murders does it take to see the cure is worse than the disease ?
There is a thought that the plume may last another five days , and even though the cloud is largely invisible to those who are being impacted by it , the damage by neglecting these precautions could be severe .
And given that the British election is on May 6th , the impact of a sustained eruption on the debates in the UK , and the result may go beyond just limiting the travel of those who would campaign , to become more dominant with the length of the flight curtailments and the responses to help resolve what are likely to be growing transportation problems .
While it is early in the morning in Europe the following picture shows the impact of the volcano in Iceland on European air traffic ( as of Thursday ) , if you compare Northern ( none ) and Southern ( 60 ) European flights .
The blue crosses are airports .
The volcano has already had a stunning impact on Europe , although articles about it are already dropping below the lead headlines .
The presence of sulphur dioxide is already obvious to local residents , though there do n't appear to be any concerns over its toxicity .
This is the toxicity information given by gasdetection.com :
WITH ACUTE EXPOSURE , 5 PPM CAUSES DRYNESS OF NOSE & THROAT AND A MEASUREABLE INCR IN RESISTANCE TO BRONCHIAL AIR FLOW ; 6 TO 8 PPM CAUSES A DECR IN TIDAL RESP VOLUME .
SNEEZING , COUGH & EYE IRRITATION OCCUR AT 10 PPM ; 20 PPM CAUSED BRONCHOSPASM ; 50 PPM CAUSES EXTREME DISCOMFORT BUT NO INJURY IN LESS THAN A 30 - MIN EXPOSURE ... 1000 PPM CAUSES DEATH IN FROM 10 MIN TO SEVERAL HR BY RESP DEPRESSION .
The larger eruptions of Katla , have ejected up to 1.5 x 10^9 cu m of material with a Volcanic Explosivity Index ( VEI ) of up to 5 .
For comparison Mt Pinatubo in 1991 ejected 1.1 x 10^10 cu m with a VEI of 6 .
The Times has an interesting graphic that shows some of the concerns and I am going to use a bit of it to show that the problem may be a little bigger than even the article suggests .
To begin with recognize that Iceland is at the intersection of different plates that together form the shell of the planet .
Whereas in some parts of the world these plates are pushing together and riding over each other , in this part of the world they are tending more to separate , so that the magma , on which the plates ride , can make its way up along the joint planes and erupt at the surface .
Map of Iceland showing major volcanoes ( The Times of London )
Now what the picture is concerned about is that generally when Eyjaflallajokull erupts so does Kalta , which is right next door .
But Katla is a larger system and the eruption is generally much more severe .
Unfortunately what has also to be considered is that there are a whole line of craters , not shown on this map , between Katla and Vatnajokull , which are also a worry .
Laki , an even greater threat than Katla , lies along this line .
Iceland 's Laki volcano erupted in 1783 , freeing gases that turned into smog .
The smog floated across the Jet Stream , changing weather patterns .
Many died from gas poisoning in the British Isles .
Crop production fell in western Europe .
Famine spread .
. . . . . .
The winter of 1784 was also one of the longest and coldest on record in North America .
New England reported a record stretch of below - zero temperatures and New Jersey reported record snow accumulation .
The Mississippi River also reportedly froze in New Orleans .
It is at the orange flag in this picture .
( Google Earth )
There is a line of eruption calderas from Katla up to Laki , which is up around Skaftareldar .
The 3.5 earthquake I wrote about on Bit Tooth Energy lies beyond Laki on the line from Eyjaflallajokull , and was centered further north in the Vatnajokull .
Some have blamed the weather created by the eight - month eruption of Laki as a possible contributory cause to the French Revolution .
An eruption of that length , ejecting as much material as it may into the atmosphere , would have consequences that go beyond just the ability to survive the noxious gaseous clouds .
The impact of the dust is shown in this picture from the British Met Office , which shows that plume reaching down past Scotland :
Dust cloud passing Scotland ( Met Office )
And the consequent distribution at different levels of the atmosphere .
High and low level ash distribution ( Met Office via the Guardian )
The agriculture of Europe would be damaged by a prolonged eruption with this distribution , and with it the possible production of biodiesel .
Consider that the growth of rapeseed ( canola ) around the world has been steadily rising over the past few years .
With European countries sitting just behind the leaders .
Somewhere over 4 million metric tons of the crop currently goes to producing biodiesel , mainly in Europe .
( Heading up towards 100,000 bd ) .
Losing a year of that crop ( and large scale volcanic activity can have an impact for over four years on the climate and the ground chemistry ) , particularly given the current possible approach of the peaking of conventional oil production , could have an unanticipated impact on overall liquid fuel availability and price .
Unfortunately rapeseed is only one of the crops that will be affected , and the significant drop in crop yields does not appear to be getting much attention yet .
Beyond that , there should be a little concern for the wind turbines that are now dotted over the horizon .
The concern is with the speed at which the tips travel through the air .
The air , that looks clean , will contain small particles of very sharp glass and other volcanic ejecta , that are the primary cause for the grounding of aircraft across Europe .
While the aircraft can see very sudden loss in engine power , because of the high speeds with which they encounter the clouds , and the volumes of debris sucked into engines that then fail .
( There are also video explanations . )
Wind wing tip speeds have been projected to be in the range from 264 ft/sec to 326 ft/sec .
At impact speeds over 120 ft / sec the particles from the eruption will start to erode the blades of the turbine .
If the eruption continues for weeks , and the turbines rotate in that atmosphere ( which looks clear to normal vision ) then they will lose surface quality , and perhaps the particles will enter into the generators ( as they do on aircraft ) doing significant damage .
Thus , beyond the initial inconvenience of the loss of a way to fly ( bearing in mind I am supposed to fly to Europe myself soon ) , there are the longer concerns over both the crops this summer and for the next four , and for the longer term health of the turbines .
All in all it is a reminder that there is never a time that Nature , with a little nudge , cannot remind us of the risks of complacency .
Jeff Savage says he is being blamed for crimes of others and claims mother is distressed by his arrest
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
A Briton facing jail , or even the possibility of a death sentence , for his alleged part in redshirt rioting in Bangkok last week , broke down in tears in court today , saying his incarceration is distressing his elderly mother .
Jeff Savage is being detained under Thailand 's emergency decree on allegations he incited , or participated in , violence and arson in the chaotic final hours of the anti-government protest , as troops moved in on demonstrators .
Fifteen people were killed on the final day of the two - month protest in the middle of Bangkok .
Led into court barefoot , Savage was manacled in leg - irons , and wearing prison - issue orange shirt and shorts .
He struggled with guards and insisted he was being blamed for the crimes of others .
" We 're being scapegoated .
Where 's all the other people who were in the protest ? …
We 're being made scapegoats .
We 're political prisoners . "
But facing a judge for the first time since being arrested at the weekend , he broke down sobbing .
" This is hurting my mother , she 's 80 years old .
Ca n't anybody help me ? "
The British embassy is providing Savage , of Tonbridge , Kent , with consular assistance .
The 48 - year - old has not yet been charged , but Pathumwan municipal court in central Bangkok today heard that police investigations were continuing into his role with the redshirts .
At this stage he is expected to be charged with violating the emergency decree , which carries a two - year jail sentence , but the Guardian has been told authorities are looking to press further , more serious , charges .
Three more witnesses to Savage 's behaviour in the final hours of the redshirts ' protest will be interviewed in coming days , the court heard .
Video footage circulating on YouTube shows Savage in the days before the protest was ended apparently urging protestors to set fire to Central World shopping centre , the biggest mall in Thailand .
" We 're gonna smash the fucking Central [ World ] Plaza … we 're gonna loot everything , gold , watches , everything , and then we 're gonna burn it to the ground , " Savage says in the video .
Central World was later razed by redshirt protesters fleeing government troops , and a government spokesman has said a " white westerner was involved in the arson attack " , seen at the building as the fire took hold .
Savage has confessed to being at the state - owned TV station Channel 3 building when it was torched on the same afternoon but says he did not help set it alight .
He says he was not near Central World .
The head of Thailand 's Department of Special Investigations – the equivalent to MI5 – has warned that those found guilty of arson could face the death penalty .
The DSI declined to comment on Savage 's case specifically , but directed the Guardian to comments made earlier this week by the chief investigator .
" There are groups of people who are burning state offices and public places , " Tharit Pengdit said .
" The DSI would like to warn these people that they could face a death sentence . "
Thailand 's prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva singled out Savage as long - term member of the anti-government redshirts , and said authorities would continue their investigations into his involvement .
" In the case of the Briton , he 's involved with the [ redshirt ] movement in Pattaya .
In - depth investigations will be carried out to find out whether he had any other role . "
Savage appeared in court alongside an Australian man Conor Purcell , who berated the judge , saying that the court had no authority to try him .
" Nobody in this country has authority over me .
I 'm not under Thai law .
I 'm only obeying international law .
I 'm head of the red gang , " he yelled at the court , brushing off efforts by embassy officials to calm him down .
Purcell , who also claimed to have been beaten in prison , is facing similar charges to Savage .
He is accused of inciting violence through a series of incendiary speeches made on the redshirts ' main protest stage .
The redshirt movement opposes the Abhisit government , alleging that it is illegitimate and a puppet for the vested interests of Bangkok 's military and wealthy elite .
Two months of protests came to a brutal end last week , when Abhisit ordered troops to move on demonstrators .
Fifteen people were killed in the crackdown , bringing to 88 the number of people killed over the course of the protest .
Both Savage and Purcell had their detentions in Bangkok remand prison extended under the emergency decree for another week .
They will reappear in court on 4 June .
Led from the court , Savage was again defiant : " They wo n't gag us .
This is a political case … they 're charging me with a criminal case . "

Steven Seagal is accused of hiring young women as personal attendants whose real job was to serve his strange and sometimes violent sexual desires , according to a civil lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles by a 23 - year - old former model who describes her experience in harrowing detail .
The plaintiff , Kayden Nguyen , said she met the action star in February through an ad on Craigslist seeking an executive assistant and , after three interviews , was told to pack for a trip to New Orleans , where the A&E show " Steven Seagal Lawman " was taping .
When she arrived , the lawsuit says , she discovered that Seagal had been keeping two young female Russian " attendants " who were essentially on - call for sex — 24 - seven .
On that first night , Nguyen was ushered to a secluded house where Seagal was staying with his wife and the two young women .
He then proceeded to treat Nguyen as his " sex toy " despite her complaints , the lawsuit says , responding to her terror as he fondled and manhandled her by saying " Relax , we wo n't do anything special tonight … I 'll save that for another night . ' "
She complained the following morning to some of the other employees , assuming that they would deliver the message to Seagal .
Hours later , the lawsuit says he assaulted her again , this time forcing her to consume " illegal pills " and penetrating her vagina with his hand until she sobbed .
The following morning , when she confronted Seagal herself , he told her there had been a " misunderstanding " ; but hours later , he assaulted her a third time , an attack that stopped only when she ran away .
The ordeal carried on for several days , and it was n't until Feb. 28 — the following Sunday — that she was able to escape the situation .
The lawsuit says Nguyen told Seagal that she had to leave to meet with family members who would be suspicious if she did n't show up .
Nonetheless , he told her not to leave the house and followed her with a gun equipped with a flashlight as she went out to a waiting cab , which sped away as she jumped in the front seat .
A message left by TheWrap with the action star 's attorney , Stuart Rosenthal , was not immediately returned Monday .
Messages left with A&E were also not immediately returned .
It was not clear why Kayden Nguyen chose to file a civil lawsuit instead of a criminal complaint .
Messages left with her lawyers were not immediately returned Monday .
Nguyen 's lawsuit claims that even after she got away , Seagal and his employees tried desperately to persuade her to return .
When she escaped , she left behind " everything of value she owned , " including car keys , her laptop , clothes , and " hundreds of dollars worth of makeup . "
She was told she would not get the items back until she signed an agreement stating she would not report the sexual attacks .
The lawsuit says Nguyen had accepted the job on Feb. 22 , a Monday , and was sped in a limo to a waiting private jet .
Her first indication that something was awry was when Seagal told her , as the plane was taking off , that his wife " would n't mind if we had a sexual relationship . "
Nguyen 's lawsuit said she could identify a " unique physiological reaction " that Seagal has to sexual arousal , which could be corroborated by the other " attendants . "
The suit did not specify what that reaction is .
The lawsuit alleges sexual harassment in violation of federal labor laws ; illegal sex trafficking ; retaliation ; wrongful termination ; and false representations about employment .
Each of the six counts seeks in excess of $ 1 million in damages .

Public belief in climate science has seen a precipitous slide in the US , according to new polling that suggests fewer Americans are concerned about the threat posed by global warming .
Nearly half of Americans – 48 % – now believe the threat of global warming has been exaggerated , the highest level since polling began 13 years ago , the poll published today by Gallup said .
It directly linked the decline in concern to the controversies about media coverage of stolen emails from the University of East Anglia climate research unit and a mistake about the Himalayan glaciers melting by 2035 in the UN 's authoritative report on global warming .
" These news reports may well have caused some Americans to re-evaluate the scientific consensus on global warming , " Gallup said .
Half of Americans now believe there is a scientific consensus on climate change .
Some 46 % believe scientists are unsure about global warming , or that it is not occurring .
A UK poll last month showed adults who believe climate change is " definitely " a reality had dropped from 44 % to 31 % over the past year .
" The last two years have marked a general reversal in the trend of Americans ' attitudes about global warming , " Gallup said .
" It may be that the continuing doubts about global warming put forth by conservatives and others are having an effect . "
The poll feeds into fears among some environmentalists that the furore over the hacked emails has given new fuel to opponents of action on climate change , and stopped short the momentum in Congress for passage of a clean energy law .
A troika of Senators trying to draft a compromise climate bill that could get broad support said this week they may not be able to produce a draft until after the Easter recess , further reducing the chances of enacting legislation in 2010 .
Meanwhile , the Obama administration faces lawsuits from Virginia , Texas , Alabama and a dozen business lobbies challenging its authority to act on greenhouse gas emissions through the Environmental Protection Agency .
Tim Wirth , a former Colorado senator who led the campaign against acid rain , told a conference call the science squabbles resembled a re-run of efforts to discredit that earlier effort for an environmental clean - up .
He said the scientists who worked on the IPCC report were woefully outmanoeuvred in PR by business groups which have the funds to employ legions of lobbyists and communications experts .
" It 's not a fair fight , " he said .
" The IPCC is just a tiny secretariat next to this giant denier machine . "
A majority of Americans continues to believe that climate change is real , but they are less convinced of its urgency .
Only 32 % believe they will be directly affected by the consequences of a warming atmosphere , despite a major report by the Obama administration last year that climate change could bring flooding , heat waves , drought and loss of wildlife to the US .
Chad Barraford is living the dream .
Inspired by Edwin Jarvis , the superhero's man-servant turned computer in the film adaptation of Iron Man , the 27 year old Barraford pieced together a digital life assistant , dubbed JARVIS , to keep his household ( and life ) in order .
JARVIS is built on a 4 - year - old Mac mini linked to everything from his home lighting / security and RFID entry system ( self - built on Arduino ) to his George Foreman grill plugged into his X10 home automation network .
JARVIS is always aware of Chad 's location ( thanks to Google Latitude ) and can be controlled in the house via remote control or a wireless mic and the Mac 's built - in speech recognition software ; or via Twitter and text messages when away .
Chad 's friends each have their own keychain RFID tags .
So does his dog .
When his friends are in the house , JARVIS becomes less chatty and does n't speak any personal information related to his finances or Facebook updates , for example .
When the dog comes home JARVIS turns on the lights in the mutt 's room .
The Chad started the project less than a year ago and cost the man less than $ 700 in gear .
Yes , he hopes to commercialize it .
Until then we 've got a few choice video selections after the break .
Android KitKat 4.4 is both Beautiful & Immersive .
It has a more polished design , improved performance , and a TON of new features .
Infact , this latest Android Update from Google is all set to match Apple ’s iOS 8
In our Complete Android Programming Course , we will walk you through the fundamentals of Android app development in Java .
You will learn ALL the skills needed to develop exciting and powerful Android mobile apps using the latest versions of the SDK and the new Android Studio development environment .
If you are truly interested in learning mobile app development for the Android platform , then this is the course for you .
What You Will Learn
We ’ll start with the basics : activities and layouts .
You ’ll learn how to create user interfaces and how to drive them from activities , and how to harness the power of intents to link activities into a compelling user experience .
Of course , an app is nothing without its data , and Android has some pretty powerful tools to store that data .
We ’ll talk about SQLite , the mobile version of the popular SQL relational database management system .
You ’ll learn how to store data in SQLite databases , and how to retrieve that data later and use it to populate several different types of user interface controls .
Making your apps sparkle with 2D and 3D graphics will also be covered .
You ’ll learn some basic animation techniques to use with any view in the course , but you ’ll also learn how to animate any object – that is , to change its properties over time !
This is a powerful technique that can be used not just for traditional animation , but for any time - bound task .
We ’ll also discuss the OpenGL - ES 3D graphics library .
We ’ve included a bonus One Hour – Live Webinar Introductory Session where Rick will walk you through the basics and advanced features that are covered in the course … at the end of which there will be an open Q&A session .
Pretty much anything a developer can do to an Android mobile device is covered in this course .

Say goodbye to the shutout streak .
And so long to the undefeated streak , too .
The Earthquakes saw too much Stefan Frei on Saturday night in a 3 - 1 defeat to visiting Toronto FC — San Jose ’s first loss in five games that ended a four - match consecutive shutout streak .
The former Cal goalkeeper made save after save at Buck Shaw Stadium , leading to San Jose ’s downfall in front of a vocal crowd of 10,214 .
The second - year Major League Soccer player was credited with six saves , including two momentum - sapping plays that made it difficult for San Jose to rally .
“ They threw up so much firepower at us , and we were still able to hold on to the win on the road , ” said Frei , whose team is 3 - 0 - 1 in its past four MLS matches .
The Quakes had a 3 - 0 - 1 run until facing Toronto , which moved into second place in the Eastern Conference .
Now San Jose ( 5 - 3 - 1 ) has little time to regroup as it plays host to the Eastern - leading Columbus Crew on Wednesday .
The Earthquakes had no explanation for coming out flat at home after earning four points on a two - game trip .
They did n’t play well until the final 20 minutes of desperation while trailing 2 - 0 .
Coach Frank Yallop played five strikers in the final 15 minutes as San Jose made a gallant effort to escape with a tie .
But the Earthquakes just could n’t break Toronto ( 5 - 4 - 1 ) , which lost its chance at a fifth consecutive shutout ( counting two non-MLS matches ) when Ramiro Corrales scored on a Bobby Convey corner kick in the 76th minute .
“ The energy was n’t good , ” Yallop said .
“ We looked hesitant , a little nervous . ”
The lack of confidence — and perhaps the elements — proved the Quakes ’ undoing .
Toronto forward Chad Barrett scored in the 31st minute when San Jose defended its goal while facing the setting sun .
Goalkeeper Joe Cannon said he could n’t see the ball on Barrett ’s score .
“ It was the most brutal elements I ever had to deal with , ” he said .
When a long serve came into the penalty box , Barrett and Jason Hernandez battled for control .
The San Jose defender tried to head the ball to Cannon but mistimed it .
Barrett pounced .
He tapped the ball into the open net , knocking down Cannon , who was drawn off the line to try to make a desperate save .
San Jose fared no better in the 66th minute when Toronto ’s leading scorer Dewayne De Rosario got the game - winner after collecting a long pass downfield .
De Rosario blew by defender Bobby Burling , who stumbled over Cannon , allowing the former Earthquake to tap it home .
De Rosario also scored in stoppage time — his eighth goal of the season — when the Quakes pulled Cannon in an attempt to score the equalizer .
It was tough trailing the Reds at the half , considering De Rosario did n’t start after playing for Canada in an exhibition last week in Argentina .
Canadian star Julian de Guzman , Toronto ’s first designated player , also did n’t start after missing last week ’s game because of a hamstring strain .
He joined De Rosario to start the second half to bolster Toronto ’s lineup .
Yet De Rosario ’s first goal woke up the Earthquakes .
The game turned into fast - break soccer as San Jose sent wave after wave of attackers forward .
Once Corrales got his first goal of the season , the intensity heightened .
“ It shows we ’ll never give up , ” said forward Chris Wondolowski , who was shut out for only the second time in seven matches .
But Frei and Toronto held .
“ Our finishing was n’t great , ” Yallop said .
“ We had our chances . ”

Now that Google has taken the next step with its GMail service and is now allowing you to manage your own domain name via GMail , my tip is it wo n’t be long before the free domain name train rolls back into town .
Remember , during Dot Com V1.0 there were a number of companies offering free domain names .
As far as I know none of those companies are still around , but Squash reckons the idea is about to be pulled out of the closet once more .
Actually , that ’s a given .
Microsoft has already promised that all users of its Office Live offering WILL receive a free domain name .
Google with this latest managed domain announcement has clearly demonstarted it wants to run interference on Office Live .
So , where it can it will almost certainly match Microsoft offer for offer .
Both Microsoft and Google will do this because a free domain is the ULTIMATE lock - in strategy .
I suspect the offer will work along these lines :
We ’ll register your domain for you for free , but we retain ownership of it .
You can use it as the basis for your email and IM identities .
We ’ll also throw in some free webspace tied to your domain for your website , photos , etc .
And all you have to give us in return is your loyalty .
Let ’s face it , if your domain name becomes your online identity , you ’re never going to change it .
If people know that they can check out your webspace at yourdomain.com , email and IM you at yourdomain.com , see your photos at picassa .
yourdomain.com , you tell me how you ’re EVER going to churn to another online provider .
The question is whether the couple of bucks that it costs to attain and then annually retain a customer ’s loyalty returns enough to make it to justify the investment .
You ’d have to say that only Google and Microsoft , maybe Yahoo and possible eBay have the strategy , product offerings and income streams to make this strategy worthwhile .
It appears more and more likely every day that any other online company is going to stand any chance in the future of dismantling the online oligopoly .
