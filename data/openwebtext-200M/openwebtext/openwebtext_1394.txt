Hi , I ’m Mark Nottingham .
I currently co-chair the IETF HTTP and QUIC Working Groups , and am a member of the Internet Architecture Board .
I usually write here about the Web , protocol design , HTTP , and caching .
Find out more .
Are Resource Packages a Good Idea ?
Resource Packages is an interesting proposal from Mozilla folks for binding together bunches of related data ( e.g. , CSS files , JavaScript and images ) and sending it in one HTTP response , rather than many , as browsers typically do .
Intuitively , this seems to make sense ; less HTTP requests is good , right ?
Maybe , maybe not .
AFAICT , there are n’t any metrics comparing RP vs. traditional sites ( has anyone done this ? ) .
In any case , a few concerns come to mind about this approach to making the Web faster .
Packaging and the Web
RP does n’t have any generic metadata mechanism .
The files in a RP are just that — bags of bits , whereas on the Web , we work with representations that include metadata .
So , clients will have to sniff the media type on each individual package member — something we ’re trying to get away from on the Web .
And , forget about using other types of header - based metadata as well .
For example , the draft points out that you can “ even use ETags to invalidate the zip file when needed ” .
However , if a cache already has existing entries , the only things linking them are the URLs ; since zip files do n’t care much more metadata than the modification time , a cache does n’t know their ETags .
Much better would be a generic , Web- centric packaging format , like MIME Multipart or Atom .
It ’s true that ZIP tools are more prevalent , but I ’d be surprised if that would be a barrier once browsers deployed another format ; when that happens , developers tend to fill the gaps quickly .
Getting Granularity and Ordering Right
Another concern I have is that Web sites are complex , and it ’s difficult to choose exactly what to package up and what to leave separate .
The effects of packaging up too much could be profound ; for example , a site that does n’t use every bit of JavaScript and CSS on every page , but puts them all in a package , will cause a client to download more than it needs to start working on a given page .
While that is n’t a big deal if you ’re sitting on a fat connection with a fast computer in your office , it matters when you ’re across the world , or just browsing across a mobile network .
It ’ll also create a lot of duplication in proxy and accelerator caches , since clients that do n’t use RP will request the same things separately .
Likewise , if you do n’t order the items in your package as the browser needs them , it will have a negative impact on performance , because the rendering engine will end up sitting around waiting for a required asset to come down the pipe .
In effect , it ’s enforcing head - of - line blocking on every response contained in the package .
I strongly suspect that choosing the right package granularity and ordering is going to be a very difficult and performance - sensitive task , and for many sites the interdependencies between JS , CSS and images will burn a lot of developer time tweaking packages .
The worst case is that some RP - enabled sites will resemble a Flash site from a UX perspective ; one big serial download with a “ waiting ” graphic , followed by snappy performance .
I do n’t know about you , but I hate that .
Working with TCP
Finally , RP seems to be built on the argument that using fewer TCP connections is better .
While it ’s true that the browsers currently limit a page to six or eight connections , and any connections over that queue up , this is a ) changing ( see this issue ) , and b ) not necessarily a bad thing .
It ’s not ( necessarily ) bad because of TCP slow - start .
As pointed out by Google and many others , a brand - new TCP connection ’s throughput is fairly restricted until it has a number of round trips , and congestion ( e.g. , buffers in intervening routers filling it up ) can slow it right back down again .
In other words , downloading 20 10 k assets across eight parallel connections is often faster and more reliable than downloading one 200k asset over one connection .
Browsers — intentionally or not — exploit this by using multiple parallel connections .
As such , putting all of your data eggs in one basket ( as it were ) can actually slow you down , never mind the ordering and granularity issues discussed above .
So , is RP a good idea ?
Well , it ’s certainly an interesting one , and in some cases — e.g. , when you have a lot of very small assets that you know you ’er going to use — it makes a lot of sense .
However , as it sits I do n’t see any numbers quantifying a benefit ( again , please correct me if I ’m wrong ! ) , and the existing recommendations ( “ serve all the resources … required by a page in a single HTTP request ” ) are a bit worrisome .
Putting that aside , this does n’t feel like a long - term solution ; it ’s more of a band - aid over one set of specific problems in the 2010 Web .
I ’m pretty biased towards a long - term solution here , because the cost of deploying clients is so high .
While it ’s true that more aggressive solutions like SPDY require both client and server support , server support is n’t hard to get once it ’s in clients , and RP requires client support anyway .
So , I ’d put forth that if we ’re going to go to the effort to change clients , we should get the most bang for our buck , and make sure it lasts .
Just my .02 .
* Labour figure calls on others to keep Wilders out of govt
* Wilders , other politicians blast move as undemocratic
* Blocking approach could push more voters towards far right
AMSTERDAM , Feb 23 ( Reuters ) - A Dutch Labour politician ’s call to keep far - right leader Geert Wilders out of a new government has stirred anger among other parties who consider the move undemocratic and likely to drive voters towards him .
Wilders and his Freedom Party have been a focus of debate since the Dutch cabinet collapsed on Saturday , as the election which could be held as early as May will be a key opportunity for the anti-immigration group to increase its influence after a stunning success at European elections last year .
[ ID: nLDE61J08D ]
Frans Timmermans , a member of the Labour party and minister for European affairs , said on Monday that Labour would refuse to govern in coalition with Wilders ’ party , and he called on other parties to consider a similar approach .
“ The Labour party stands for a completely different Holland than the party of Wilders , and for that reason we cannot be in a government with him , ” a spokeswoman for the Labour party said .
“ He ( Timmermans ) dared other parties to think the same thing .
Do they want to be in a government that segregates people by race and religion ? ”
Wilders has described the call as an “ arrogant ” attempt to ringfence his Freedom Party ( PVV ) and said it was an insult to the democratic system , telling Dutch media “ the voter will seek punishment for this ” .
Members of other parties have also described the move as undemocratic and warned that it could push voters into the arms of Wilders , considered a maverick among the political elite .
While the socialist SP said it would not consider working in coalition with Wilders ’ party due to their policy differences , it criticised Timmermans nonetheless .
“ This is unbelievably stupid .
What Timmermans is saying is undemocratic , the voter can surely make up their own mind , ” said SP leader Agnes Kant in the Dutch daily Trouw .
“ Wilders can now say there is a barrier being built around him . ”
Members of other parties also dismissed the calls , with the head of the Liberal VVD party Mark Rutte telling Dutch radio he was not ruling anyone out as a potential coalition partner and Christian Democrat party chairman Pieter van Geel describing the comments as foolish .
POISED FOR GAINS
Wilders ’ party comes first or second in most polls for the next election , and could win up to 24 seats in the 150 - seat Dutch Parliament after becoming the second biggest Dutch party in the EU Parliament last year .
So far the CDA and VVD have left the door open to be in a coalition with Wilders .
But in recent polls , just 27 percent of respondents said their reaction to a combination of the three in a cabinet would be ‘ positive ’ or ‘ very positive ’ .
Wilders , who believes that Islam is a violent religion and what he calls the Islamisation of Europe must stop , has consistently challenged the established order with his ferocious debating style , often accusing the government of cowardice .
He set up his own party after he was forced out of the VVD , and has lived under guard since 2004 , when a Dutch - Moroccan killed filmmaker and Islam critic Theo van Gogh .
He has rallied support amongst many Dutch people who are uncomfortable with the rapid changes in their country , and has filled the void left by populist Pim Fortuyn who had called for an end to immigration before he was gunned down in 2002 .

Binyam Mohamed has been involved in a lengthy legal battle
The foreign secretary has lost an Appeal Court bid to stop the disclosure of secret information relating to the alleged torture of a UK resident .
Ethiopian - born Binyam Mohamed , 31 , says UK authorities knew he was tortured at the behest of US authorities after his detention in Pakistan in 2002 .
Judges ruled that paragraphs which say his treatment was " cruel , inhuman and degrading " should be released .
David Miliband said the ruling was " not evidence that the system is broken " .
The judgement was delivered by the three most senior Court of Appeal judges in England and Wales .
Cruel and inhuman Commenting on the case , the prime minister 's spokesman said the government stood firmly against torture and cruel and inhumane treatment .
Mr Mohamed 's lawyer , Clive Stafford - Smith , said the seven paragraphs were just " crumbs " and there was " a vast body of other information out there showing Binyam Mohamed was abused " .
" There 's really no denying that the British knew all about it , " he added .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The key details are contained in a seven - paragraph summary of what the CIA told British intelligence officials about Mr Mohamed 's treatment in 2002 .
These paragraphs have now been published on the Foreign Office website .
The paragraphs concern a period in which Mr Mohamed was being held by Pakistani interrogators at the behest of the US , who suspected him of having received firearms and explosives training from al - Qaeda in Afghanistan .
They say Mr Mohamed was intentionally subjected to continuous sleep deprivation , as well as threats and inducements , including playing on his fears that he would be passed on to another country .
London learnt that the stress brought on by these deliberate tactics was increased by him being shackled during his interviews and that Mr Mohamed was eventually placed on suicide watch .
The court 's judgement stated : " The treatment reported , if it had been administered on behalf of the United Kingdom would clearly have been in breach of [ a ban on torture ] .
" Although it is not necessary for us to categorise the treatment reported , it could be readily contended to be at the very least cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment of BM by the United States authorities . "
Following the ruling , Mr Miliband gave a statement to the House of Commons , saying he accepted the court 's decision , but that the government 's objection had never been about the seven paragraphs specifically .
" We have fought this case and brought the appeal to defend a principle we believe is fundamental to our national security - that intelligence shared with us will be protected by us , " the foreign secretary said .
' Key partner ' " No - one likes to lose a case , but the force of the judgement is that it firmly recognises that principle . "
ANALYSIS Dominic Casciani , BBC home affairs reporter
This battle was about the control principle - that the UK does not have permission to reveal any intelligence that the US passes on in confidence .
But that position in relation to Binyam Mohamed 's treatment was fatally undermined by two factors .
Firstly , the courts held that the secret seven paragraphs related to potentially criminal ill - treatment , rather than critical matters of national security .
The Lord Chief Justice makes plain in his judgement that he might have thought differently if the material had been genuinely secret .
Secondly , the Obama White House has been busy declassifying material and memos that covered what was done in America 's name after 9/11 .
Lawyers in this case now have a new question :
What were the rules in 2002 for British intelligence officers who discovered a terrorism suspect was being ill - treated elsewhere ?
The prime minister says the revised rules will be published soon but the old ones will remain secret .
Torture detail revealed : Analysis Binyam ruling manipulation claim
He added : " This judgement is not evidence that the system is broken , rather it is evidence that the system is working and the full force of the law is available when citizens believe they have just cause . "
US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton is believed to be " understanding " about the UK government 's position after talking with Mr Miliband , the BBC has learned .
A US senior official has said the judgement " will complicate the confidentiality of our intelligence - sharing relationship with the UK " but the Federal Government is closed because of blizzard conditions and it is thought it will take sometime for the American Government to work out the implications of the lengthy judgement .
It is understood that the UK government would be surprised if intelligence sharing was seriously downgraded , but they are not yet sure of any practical consequences .
A senior US official told the BBC the administration was " deeply disappointed " .
" As we warned , the court 's judgement will complicate the confidentiality of our intelligence - sharing relationship with the UK , and it will have to factor into our decision - making going forward , " he said .
He said the UK remained " a key partner " in the fight against terrorism and both sides would " need to redouble our efforts to work through this challenge " .
It has emerged that a senior government lawyer , Jonathan Sumption QC , wrote to the Court of Appeal criticising the original wording of the judgement .
He argued it would be " exceptionally damaging " if published because it would give the impression " that the Security Service does not in fact operate a culture that respects human rights or abjures participation in coercive interrogation techniques " .
The passages to which Mr Sumption objected did not appear in the version of the judgement that was eventually published .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague said Mr Mohamed 's alleged treatment was " utterly unacceptable " , adding : " These things - if true - are not only morally wrong , but harm our efforts to combat terrorists , play into the hands of their propagandists and weaken rather than strengthen our national security . "
Liberal Democrats spokesman Ed Davey called for a judicial inquiry to investigate " which ministers knew the US was using torture , what they did about it , and whether or not those ministers caused Britain to be complicit in torture " .
BINYAM MOHAMED
Detained in Pakistan in 2002 , questioned there by MI5 officer Transferred to Morocco , claims he was tortured in US custody and asked questions supplied by MI5 Later interned in Guantanamo Bay and eventually released in 2009 Last year , the High Court ruled that the seven paragraphs should be published as the risk to national security was " not a serious one " and there was " overwhelming " public interest in disclosing the material .
However , the summary was kept secret to allow the foreign secretary to appeal .
Mr Mohamed , an Ethiopian granted refugee status in Britain in 1994 , was initially arrested in Pakistan in 2002 over a visa irregularity and was handed over to US officials .
He was secretly flown to Morocco in 2002 .
There , he says , he was tortured while interrogators asked him about his life in London - questions , he says , that could have come only from British intelligence officers .
Mr Mohamed was sent to the Guantanamo Bay detention facility , run by the US in Cuba , in 2004 .
He was held there until his release without charge in February 2009 , when he returned to the UK .
Human rights organisation Amnesty International UK said it welcomed the court 's decision as " another step toward accountability and transparency " , but that a full public inquiry was needed into allegations of British complicity in torture .

A configuration change caused the brief outage , said Microsoft Microsoft has apologised for a brief outage which saw its search site Bing disappear from the internet .
The outage lasted for nearly 30 minutes in the early hours of 3 December .
At that time anyone visiting the site got an error message .
A Microsoft statement said the outage was caused by a " configuration change " made to the site during testing .
This , it said , had " unfortunate and unintended consequences " which included making the site unavailable .
Writing on the Bing blog Satya Nadella , one of Microsoft 's senior vice presidents in its Online Services Division , said the mistake led to people either being unable to find the site or having their queries returned unanswered .
" As soon as the issue was detected , the change was rolled back , which caused the site to return to normal behavior , " wrote Mr Nadella .
Detecting the problem and fixing it took about 30 minutes , he said .
Mr Nadella added that Microsoft was looking into the genesis of the incident to find out what needs to be done to stop such an incident happening again .
Microsoft has worked hard to position Bing as a serious rival to Google and the unscheduled downtime will dent this image .
As soon as the mistake became apparent messages about it on microblogging site Twitter started to appear .
In response Tony Chor , a Bing engineer , tweeted that Microsoft was working on bringing the site back up .
Not all aspects of the Bing service were knocked out by the configuration change .
Many reported that Bing Maps was still available .
This week Microsoft updated Bing Maps to add test features that allows applications , such as real time traffic feeds , to be added to the site .
It also introduced a system that lets people create 360 degree panoramas of locations .

Remember adolescence ?
Raging hormones , awkward moments , embarrassing situations ?
Everyone remembers those years of sexual development with a bit of angst .
It was difficult to navigate then , and it is just as difficult now .
Exploring one ’s sexual identity during adolescence is normal , and we all stumbled our way through it .
But how many of our stumbles resulted in criminal charges ?
Pennsylvania House Bill 2189 would make “ sexting , ” the act of transmitting or receiving a provocative or nude photo of yourself or others , a crime — but only if you are a teenager between the ages of 13 - 17 .
Recent research suggests that up to 20 percent of all teenagers have consensually sent or received some form of sexual message via text or e-mail — that means if found guilty under HB 2189 , all of these teens could become ineligible for college loans , scholarships , military service and employment .
HB 2189 will overwhelm Pennsylvania ’s juvenile court system and harm the children we are trying to protect .
For today ’s adolescents , technology infiltrates everything they do , so when they express themselves — whether it ’s frustration about school or parents , excitement with friends or developing intimacy with a partner — teens often do it through electronic communication .
Teens often feel “ safer ” when they are alone and do not have to be face to face with the person with whom they are communicating .
Electronic communications depersonalize these experiences for today ’s youth , just as the telephone did for previous generations .
This new technology allows kids to explore their sexuality without physical contact , but they fail to recognize the risks involved .
Experts on adolescent development suggest that teens have always found ways to explore their sexual identity and express themselves sexually — sexting is merely the newest form , using the latest technology .
At the same time , we ’ve all heard the widely publicized and sometimes tragic stories of private photos becoming public .
In these instances , instead of utilizing existing harassment laws to prosecute the person who intended to do harm , the bill would seek to also prosecute the victim , potentially resulting in less reported instances of true harassment or abuse .
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that the First Amendment protects images of nude minors as free expression where there is no exploitation or abuse of the minors involved .
When teens engage in sexting , they are willingly sharing photos of themselves and there is no abuse — thus , the child pornography standard constitutionally does not apply .
The existing child pornography laws are meant to safeguard kids from abuse — yet HB 2189 would harm the youth it aims to protect .
As adults , we understand that sexting can have unintended consequences and potentially damage a young person ’s life .
However , research on adolescent development shows that youth often do not consider long - term consequences of actions and are not deterred by the threat of potential future prosecution .
Proponents suggest they want to help youth avoid felony prosecutions under existing child pornography laws , but HB 2189 does not prevent prosecutors from charging children with child pornography .
Instead , it exposes kids to an additional crime , thereby widening the net and potentially bringing thousands more kids into the juvenile justice system , risking permanent criminal records , removal from their homes and disrupted educations .
Rather than taking such harsh measures to criminalize sexting , the General Assembly should take steps toward educating teens about the negative consequences of sending their personal images via text message and the Internet .
Other states have required educational programming in schools or through cell phone carriers to curb the harmful effects of sexting .
These methods seek to protect teens by preventing sexting , rather than punishing them for what is simply normal adolescent development playing out in a new and inappropriate forum .
Parents , legislators , taxpayers and voters need to stop HB 2189 before it does our children more harm than good .

Apple last week began banning iPhone apps containing " overtly sexual content . "
But on Monday the company said it intends to leave apps from major publishers , such as Playboy and Sports Illustrated , untouched .
In an interview with The New York Times , Apple 's vice president of marketing Phil Schiller explained the company was responding to complaints from concerned parents and female customers .
“ It came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading and objectionable , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see , ” Schiller told NY Times ' Jenna Wortham .
Though the move is sure to mitigate complaints , and even please some developers turned off by raunchy content cluttering the App Store , it 's questionable why the Playboy and Sports Illustrated apps , which contain images of partially nude women , would n't offend the same customers .
Schiller explained that the Playboy and Sports Illustrated apps came from more reputable companies .
“ The difference is this is a well - known company with previously published material available broadly in a well - accepted format , ” Schiller said .
The retroactive kind - of - sort - of ban of sex - tinged apps is certainly leaving some developers sore .
Wortham interviewed Fred Clarke , co-president of a small software company called On the Go Girls , who lost 50 apps as a result of the ban .
Clarke had been making thousands of dollars off the App Store , but no longer .
" It ’s very hard to go from making a good living to zero , ” he said .
“ This goes farther than sexy content .
For developers , how do you know you are n’t going to invest thousands into a business only to find out one day you ’ve been cut off ? "
Apple from day one has said porn was not allowed in the App Store , so developers instead coded apps that contained only partial nudity .
( Some were able to sneak full nudity into their apps , but not for long before Apple slammed the ban hammer . )
Apple last year implemented a Parental Controls feature to prevent children from downloading content that Apple deemed " 17 + . "
However , the feature still allows the App Store to display search results for 17 + content even if an iPhone has been configured to prohibit downloading such apps .
Clearly , the Parental Controls tool has not been effective in addressing parents ' concerns .

Despite calls for restraint in multi-million dollar pay packages , Wall Street bonuses jumped by 17 % to $ 20.3 bn ( £ 13 bn ) for 2009 as America 's financial services industry rebounded swiftly from the credit crunch to healthy profitability , according to New York 's tax department .
New York state 's comptroller , Thomas DiNapoli , said the average taxable bonus on Wall Street was $ 123,850 , a figure he described as a " bitter pill " for many people still struggling with record unemployment and ongoing economic weakness on the high street .
Bonuses at banks , fund management firms and stockbrokers are a crucial element in New York 's income tax revenue and the state keeps a careful tally of each year 's projected payout on Wall Street .
DiNapoli said the total bonus pool was down by about a third on 2007 , when the financial crisis had yet to wreak unprecedented havoc on the markets .
But he said Wall Street was on track to make an aggregate profit of as much as $ 55 bn for 2009 , a remarkable recovery after a $ 43 bn loss in 2008 .
" The good news is that Wall Street is back so there 's profitability , " said DiNapoli , who described this as positive from a tax revenue point of view .
But he added : " It 's still a bitter pill for many people with unemployment at a record high in our state , as it is in many other parts of the country . "
At three of Wall Street 's biggest banks – Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley – the total bonus pool rose by 31 % .
This suggests lucrative payouts at levels below the top echelons of management .
Many of the banks were careful to moderate highly publicised bonuses awarded to their chief executives .
Goldman , for example , handed its chief executive , Lloyd Blankfein , a bonus of $ 9 m which was regarded on Wall Street as relatively low in comparison to his $ 69 m pay package at the height of the boom in 2007 .
DiNapoli , a Democrat , said Wall Street was only too aware of public outrage over remuneration : " There 's certainly an accurate point of view that this sector of the economy , while it 's important , had a lot to do with the meltdown . "
The Obama administration has urged Wall Street to be mindful of popular discontent over bonuses .
But the US Treasury has stopped short of any stringent restrictions .
The US government has merely backed " say on pay " votes at annual meetings , giving shareholders a voice on remuneration issues .
And a so - called " pay czar " was appointed to oversee bonuses at banks in receipt of government bailouts , although his remit is highly restricted .
Shortly after taking office last year , president Barack Obama described big bonuses on Wall Street as " the height of irresponsibility " and he threatened to impose pay caps .
But the president has since softened his line – Obama recently said he did not begrudge bonuses to bank chief executives , praising the bosses of Goldman and JP Morgan as " very savvy businessmen " .
Odierno requests more combat forces in Iraq — beyond the Obama deadline
A Best Defense Exclusive :
In a move that could force President Obama to break his vow to get all combat troops out of Iraq by August of this year , his top commander in Iraq recently officially requested keeping a combat brigade in the northern part of the country beyond that deadline , three people close to the situation said Wednesday .
Gen . Raymond Odierno asked for a brigade to try to keep the peace in the disputed city of Kirkuk , but only got a polite nod from the president when the issue was raised during his recent meetings in Washington , according to two of the people familiar with the discussions .
If the brigade in northern Iraq is indeed kept in Iraq past the deadline , there will be a fan dance under which it no longer will be called a combat unit , but like the six other combat brigades being kept past the deadline , will be called an advisory unit .
I can imagine the press releases that will follow - " Three U.S. Army soldiers were killed last night in an advisory operation . . . . "
The feeling in the corridors of the White House is that the general is asking the right questions , but a bit clumsily , and certainly too early for political comfort , especially in Iraq , which is about to hold a national election .
So I suspect the administration ’s bottom line for Odierno was , Hey , Shreko , put a sock in it until after the Iraqi elections , because what we need is a new Iraqi government to be formed so it can quietly begin talking to us about re-visiting some of those 2008 SOFA agreements about future troop levels .
This debate is just beginning .
I expect that Obama actually is going to have to break his promises on Iraq and keep a fairly large force in Iraq , but of course that wo n’t be the first time he ’s had to depart from his campaign rhetoric on this war .
Speaking of which , CNAS , the little think tank that could , plans today to post a report ( Update : now posted ) by me titled The Burden about the way forward in Iraq .
It argues that we need to think about keeping troops there for many years , not because I think it is a good answer , but because I think it is the least bad one .
Let ’s open the betting :
How many U.S. military personnel will be in Iraq four years from today –that is , Feb. 25 , 2014 ?
The person who guesses closest gets a signed copy of any of my books .
My guess : 28,895 .
Not " combat " troops , of course !
Goodness no .
Just " advisory " troops who carry M - 16s and call in airstrikes and such .

Nah ...
That ca n't be Christopher Walken .
Looks more like a buffed - up Mark Hamill .
But , before he specialised as Hollywood 's go - to guy for anybody needing crazies , psychopaths and all - round odd bods , Walken was a fresh - faced , fighting - fit dancer .
One day , we promise to ask him what happened to make him become so unsettling .
Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon
Jack and Tony made cinema history dragging up as Josephine and Daphne , the heroes of Some Like It Hot .
But it was n't their last collaboration : they joined Blake Edwards '
The Great Race in 1965 , determined to prove their manhood by looking as butch as possible .
We think Lemmon 's overdone it a bit with that ... hell , what is that thing on his upper lip ?

On - screen , Brando ’s brooding , intense machismo was the look of the early 50s .
Little did his adoring fans know that in private Brando was a sensitive softie , collaborating with a friend on his pet project - an adaptation of Cats .

Long before Miami Vice , Don Johnson was most famous for another kind of vice - his scandalous relationship with Tippi Hedren 's jailbait daughter .
This pic was taken in 1975 , which would make Griffith legal ... just about .
But bear in mind they 'd already been dating several years by this point .
Jane Fonda
She 'd go on to become an intergalactic sex siren in Barbarella , win an Oscar playing a prostitute in Klute , and give horny teenagers a helping hand by inventing the celebrity work - out video .
But , as this pic shows , she was a flirty / dirty , skirts - up kinda gal long before that .
Plus , she plays a mean hand of cards .

What does it take to scare The Master of Suspense , the man who turned showers , birds and the view out of the window into objects of terror ?
According to this shot , he has a morbid fear of being dragged through the snow by what appears to be a Yeti .
Which is probably why he never made a film about abominable snowmen .

Out came the peroxide curls , full - bodied pout and how - low - can - you - go necklines , and it was goodbye , Norma Jeane .
Yet , as this off - the - cuff shot from early in her career proves , the fragile girl behind the ' Marilyn ' image occasionally resurfaced .
Michael & Kirk Douglas
Few Hollywood father / son dynasties look as alike as the Douglases .
The only way to tell them apart is fashion - while old - school Kirk favours the rugged cowboy look , modern man Michael prefers a fluffy dressing gown .

Eighteen people have been killed in a head - on collision between two passenger trains in Belgium , although the death toll could rise .
Railway officials said the trains collided during the morning rush hour at Halle , south - west of Brussels .
One reportedly missed a stop signal .
" The devastation is enormous , " said an official , as bloodied passengers were helped from the wrecked carriages .
Rail services to south - western Belgium , Paris and London were cancelled .
There were varying reports about the death toll , but eight hours after the crash the crisis centre set up to deal with the accident said 15 men and three women had been killed .
AT THE SCENE Matt Cole , BBC News , Halle
As word spread about what is believed to be Belgium 's worst railway crash in 30 years , crowds of onlookers began to gather .
Among them were small children , being raised aloft by their parents to stare at the scene on the first day of their half - term holiday .
The walking wounded were taken from the crash site and up a hill to a nearby sports centre , where they received basic medical care .
Outside people with sombre faces hugged each other as all around the numbers of emergency personnel grew .
Wintry scene of destruction
Other officials were reported as saying up to 25 people had died .
There were reports of passengers still trapped in the wreckage hours after the crash .
' Enormous devastation '
The two trains collided in the commuter town around 0830 local time ( 0730 GMT ) .
The governor of Flemish Brabant province , Lodewijk De Witte , said one of the trains seemed to have missed a stop signal .
Belgium 's track operator Infrabel said an investigation into the accident was under way , and it was difficult to speculate on the cause at this stage .
Television pictures showed carriages pushed up at an angle or leaning to the side from the force of the crash .
Witnesses said people were thrown around violently inside the trains with one passenger describing the " carriages compacted together " by the collision .
The two trains were carrying a total of about 250 to 300 people , a rail official said , AFP news agency reported .
Emergency workers said there was considerable damage to the overhead power lines at the station in Buizingen , the district of Halle where the trains crashed .
" The devastation is enormous , " said Infrabel spokesman Bram De Saedeleer .
" Officials of the public prosecutor 's office are at the scene and will supervise the investigation .
Our first concern is for the victims . "
Doctors were treating some of the injured at the scene of the crash , including performing amputations , while others had been taken to nearby hospitals .
In pictures : Belgian train crash Passenger describes the shock Slightly injured passengers , said to number about 150 , were taken to a sports hall for treatment .
But there has been confusion over the number of people killed and injured in the collision .
Belgian broadcaster VRT reported that sources with the national railway operator said 25 people had been killed , but the operator , SNCB , said it had not released an official figure .
Local mayor Dirk Pieters said " the most recent information we have is that 20 people died .
I base this on what the police and firefighters tell me . "
' Nightmare '
One passenger in the third carriage , Christian Wampach , told AP news agency : " It was a nightmare .
" We were thrown about for about 15 seconds .
There were a number of people injured in my car but I think all the dead were in the first car . "

Infrabel said one train had been going from Leuven to Braine - le - Comte while the second train had been travelling from Quievrain to Liege .
The accident led to the cancellation of services between Brussels and Tournai or Mons .
And Eurostar said its Brussels trains , including those to and from the UK , were cancelled until further notice .
Other high - speed trains between Paris and Brussels have also been cancelled .
In 2001 , eight people were killed and 12 were injured in a head - on collision between commuter trains outside Brussels .
It was thought that language difficulties between a Flemish - speaking signalman and a French - speaking colleague were a factor in that crash .
Another accident in 2008 left more than 40 people injured when a passenger train travelling in the wrong direction hit a goods train in central Belgium , AFP news agency said .

Even during the ongoing recession , immigration reform legislation that legalizes undocumented immigrants would boost the American economy , according to a new study out of UCLA .
The report said that legalization , along with a program that allows for future immigration based on the labor market , would create jobs , increase wages and generate more tax revenue .
Comprehensive immigration reform would add an estimated $ 1.5 trillion to the U.S. gross domestic product over 10 years , according to the report .
“ If we are going to create a solid recovery with good wages , we have to fix this hole that we have at the bottom of the labor market , ” said the author , Raúl Hinojosa - Ojeda , an associate professor with the UCLA Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies .
“ This is not about bringing in a lot of workers .
This is about your neighbors and if we are better off where everybody in the economy has the ability to fight for their families and to contribute more to the economy rather than staying in the shadows . ”
Hinojosa - Ojeda based the study in part on surveys done after 1986 legislation that resulted in the legalization of nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants .
Those surveys showed that immigrants who became legal moved on to better - paying jobs and became more educated , resulting in more spending and more tax revenue .
That legislation was passed during a similar economic downturn , he said .
The study , being released today , comes shortly after a renewed commitment by the Obama administration to back legislation this year that would provide a path to citizenship for an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States .
The study is being released by two Washington - based immigrant rights organizations , the Immigration Policy Center and the Center for American Progress .
Hinojosa - Ojeda also projected that the economy would benefit from a temporary worker program , by raising the GDP by $ 792 billion .
And the economy would suffer if the U.S. deported all illegal immigrants , which he acknowledged was an unlikely option .
Mass deportation , he concluded , would reduce the GDP by $ 2.6 trillion over 10 years .
Immigration reform advocates said linking economic recovery and immigration reform seems counterintuitive , but the report shows that they are closely connected .
“ You ca n’t build a strong , robust economy on top of a broken immigration system , ” said Angela Kelley , vice president of immigration policy and advocacy for the Center for American Progress .
“ In fact , if you fix our immigration system , it makes our economy stronger and more robust . ”
But Federation for American Immigration Reform spokesman Ira Mehlman said that even with legal status , many immigrants would continue to work in low - wage jobs , meaning their tax revenue would n’t make much of a difference to the economy .
Also , legalization would flood the labor market and drive down wages rather than increase them , he said .
Mehlman said those supporting amnesty know they have a difficult sell because of the state of the economy .
“ They are trying to portray this as an economic shot in the arm , ” he said .
“ But I am not sure the American public is going to buy it . ”

The U.S. Christian Right and the Attack on Gays in Africa
| Printer Friendly
Kapya Kaoma is an Anglican priest from Zambia and project director of Political Research Associates .
He is the author of PRA ’s October 2009 report , Globalizing the Culture Wars : U.S. Conservatives , African Churches and Homophobia .
The Uganda Story
For two days in early March 2009 , Ugandans flocked to the Kampala Triangle Hotel for the Family Life Network 's " Seminar on Exposing the Homosexuals ' Agenda . "
The seminar 's very title revealed its claim : LGBT people and activists are engaged in a well thought - out plan to take over the world .
The U.S. culture wars had come to Africa with a vengeance .
Special Report !
Globalizing the Culture Wars
U.S. Conservatives , African Churches , and Homophobia
To put on the conference , the Uganda - based Family Life Network – led by Stephen Langa with the goal of " restoring " traditional family values and morals in Uganda – teamed with two U.S. hatemongers from the Christian Right , Holocaust revisionist Scott Lively and Dan Schmierer of the ex-gay group Exodus International .
[ 1 ]
Vocal opposition in international circles did not stop the country 's high profile religious leaders , parliamentarians , police officers , teachers , and concerned parents from attending .
Indeed , parliamentary action to wage war on gays was on the conference agenda .
It was not enough that homosexuality is illegal in Uganda .
As someone stated from the podium ,
[ The parliament ] feels it is necessary to draft a new law that deals comprehensively with the issue of homosexuality and … takes into account the international gay agenda … .
Right now there is a proposal that a new law be drafted .
[ 2 ]
The unsuspecting audience heard Lively promote his book , The Pink Swastika , and his argument that not only are gays seeking to take over the world , but they also threaten society by causing higher rates of divorce , child abuse , and HIV / AIDS .
Legalizing homosexuality is on par with accepting " molestation of children or having sex with animals , " he said .
As Lively puts it , LGBT issues cannot be considered human rights issues .
" The people coming to Africa now and advancing the idea that human rights serves the homosexual interests are absolutely wrong , " he said .
" Many of them are outright liars and they are manipulating history ; they are manipulating facts in order to push their political agenda . "
Lively even tarred abortion rights as " a product of the gay philosophy " meant to promote sexual promiscuity in order to " destroy the family . "
In sum , he warned , U.S. homosexuals are out to recruit young people into homosexual lifestyles so they must be stopped .
Photo :
In March 2009 , Scott Lively , the Holocaust revisionist and author of The Pink Swastika , warned Ugandans that gays posed a dire threat to their children and society .
Lively had a receptive audience .
Harry Mwebesa of Family Life Network told the crowd ,
Dr. Scott told us about Brazil where 10 years ago , homosexuality was unheard of ….
Today it is the capital … .
There are people that have been against homosexuality that are having to leave because of the pressure and the threats that they are putting on them .
That is how serious it is .
Another participant who called himself Elijah said ,
The man of God [ Scott Lively ] told us about …a movement behind the promotion of homosexuality and it is called gay movement .
Me , I had never heard of that .
But I got to know that there is a force behind homosexuality which we need to tackle with force .
He also told us that these people who are behind this …evil , they have all resources that they need … to spread this evil . [ In ] Africa , Uganda in particular ... it is more easy for the young generation to get attracted into the evil .
Since that day …we need to stand firm to fight homosexuality .
If only Lively 's influence ended there .
But a few days later , he met with Ugandan lawmakers and government officials , some of whom would draft parliament 's Anti-Homosexuality
Act of 2009 the next month .
This act would ban LGBT organizing and give the death penalty for gays , though not heterosexuals , who have sex with someone underage or while infected with the HIV / AIDS virus .
[ 3 ]
Lively and the " traditional family values " language of U.S. antigay campaigners echoes through the draft legislation :
Research indicates that the homosexuality has a variety of negative consequences including higher incidences of violence , sexually transmitted diseases , and use of drugs .
The higher incidence of separation and break - up in homosexual relationships also creates a highly unstable environment for children raised by homosexuals through adoption or otherwise , and can have profound psychological consequences on those children .
In addition , the promotion of homosexual behavior undermines our traditional family values .
Family Life Network 's Langa pushed people at a follow up meeting to stand up for the tougher law against homosexuality for their children 's sake , echoing Lively in charging that Ugandan gays and activists were being paid by U.S. gays to recruit schoolchildren into homosexuality .
Amid the utter hysteria , any sense that homosexuality has been in Africa from time immemorial was lost .
While hardly embraced , and indeed illegal in many countries , at least LGBT people were not hounded by churches and police alike – until American culture warriors came to Africa .
Bishop Christopher Ssenjonyo , one of the most progressive voices on LGBT issues in Uganda , expressed his own concerns about the Americans ' role to me in March , " I am sure that these lies will incite public hatred against gays . "
How Did We Get Here ?
How did we get to this point ?
Scott Lively and Don Schmierer are just two among a parade of right - leaning American Christians who have brought the U.S. culture wars to Africa .
But unlike the United States , in Africa sexual minorities are only thinly organized and have few allies who will stand up with them .
Those who do are tarred as neocolonialist and racist , because of the effectiveness of U.S. Right organizing in Africa .
The result is tragedy .
Thankfully , because of Kenya 's democratic past and stronger civil society , citizens managed to challenge and slow down efforts for broad criminalization of homosexuality .
But in more authoritarian countries , like Uganda and Nigeria , where some counties punish homosexuality with death , U.S. religious conservatives are better able to promote their anti-LGBT agenda , building on decades of missionary work .
U.S. evangelicals like California 's Rick Warren have turned their attention to Africa as its role in global Christianity has grown .
As Warren recently told Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , " If you want to know the future of evangelicalism , it is in [ Africa , Asia and Latin America . ]
To give you an example , in 1900 there were only 10 million Christians in all of Africa – 10 % of the population .
Today there are 360 million Christians in Africa , over half the population . " [ 4 ]
Warren 's numbers are wrong and fewer than half of Africans are Christian .
Still , 30 million of the Anglican Communion 's 77 million members live in Nigeria , Uganda and Kenya .
Warren is especially influential on the continent , enjoying close ties to African religious and political leaders .
They quote him to justify discrimination against LGBT people , and to support their challenge to U.S. mainline Protestants liberalizing their policies around gay ordination .
" Homosexuality is not a natural way of life and thus not a human right , " Warren said during a March - April 2008 visit with African religious and political leaders in Rwanda , Uganda , and Kenya .
That quote has reverberated ever since . [ 5 ]
Warren 's bestselling book , A Purpose Driven Life is studied across sub-Saharan Africa and his Saddleback Church in Lake Forest , California has close ties with leaders across Africa , including , until recently , Martin Ssempa of Uganda 's Makerere Community Church .
Ssempa is one of the key architects of the antigay bill and persecution of LGBT people in Uganda .
He made global news when he published the names of LGBT people in the local press and destroyed condoms to promote abstinence - only programs in the fight against HIV / AIDS in Uganda .
Ssempa was a regular visitor to Saddleback until Warren distanced himself from him in 2008 .
Within Africa , Warren seems to be progressive when it comes to fighting poverty , illiteracy and HIV / AIDS .
These efforts have painted him as a real partner in development .
However , his antipoverty and education strategies also promote conservative institutional power and ideologies in Africa , including homophobia .
As Warren 's " purpose - driven " projects in Rwanda , Kenya , Nigeria and Uganda have grown , so too have levels of active homophobia and proposed laws against LGBT people .
And Warren 's allies – particularly Anglican Archbishops Henry Orombi of Uganda , Peter Akinola of Nigeria , Emmanuel Kolini of Rwanda and Benjamin Nzimbi of Kenya – are in the forefront of advocating for stiffer laws against LGBT persons in their countries . [ 6 ]
Archbishop Orombi argues that U.S. homosexuals should be kept out of Uganda because they are " taking advantage of the abject poverty in Africa to lure people into their club [ homosexuality ] . " [ 7 ]
In neighboring Nigeria , Archbishop Akinola wrote , " We are especially concerned about those who are using large sums of money to lure our youth to see homosexuality and lesbianism as normative .
We must consistently and faithfully teach about God 's commands on this ungodly practice and help those with such orientation to seek deliverance and pastoral counsel . " [

History of U.S. Conservatives in Africa
If they had faced strong opposition , U.S. conservatives might not have been so successful in promoting their homophobic politics .
Traditionally , evangelical African churches have been biblically and doctrinally orthodox but socially progressive on such issues as national liberation and poverty , making them natural partners of the politically liberal western churches .
But their religious orthodoxy also provides the U.S. Right with an opportunity .
Africans resonate with the denunciation of homosexuality as a postcolonial plot ; their homophobia is as much an expression of resistance to the West as it is a statement about human sexuality .
Similarly campaigns for " family values " in Africa rest on rich indigenous notions of the importance of family and procreation .
In Africa , " family " expresses the idea that to be human is to be embedded in community , a concept called ubuntu .
African traditional values also value procreation , making those hindering this virtue an enemy of life ( see box 2 ) .
Although Rick Warren 's involvement in Africa is the most celebrated , and Lively 's perhaps the most notorious , they are not the first U.S. conservative evangelicals to influence African policies .
Pat Robertson 's television show The 700 Club is watched across sub-Saharan Africa .
Yet most Africans are not aware that Robertson supported the civil war in Angola and the oppressive White governments of Rhodesia ( now Zimbabwe ) and South Africa .
He was one of many U.S. conservative evangelicals , some of whom came to Africa as missionaries in the 1980s , who sided with those
White minority governments in their effort to stop the spread of liberation theology .
Allied with them was – and is – the Institute on Religion and Democracy ( IRD ) , a U.S. neoconservative group that also supported the White regimes and challenged the National Council of Churches as a group of dangerous Marxists supporting subversion .
The group formed in 1981 with the goal of weakening and splitting U.S. mainline denominations in order to block their powerful progressive social witness promoting social and economic justice . [ 9 ]
During this same period , the U.S. mainline churches sided with oppressed Africans living in White regimes .
Along with exposing the crimes committed in the name of fighting communism , these churches provided financial and social support to displaced families in Africa , Asia , and South America .
But today the mainline churches are labeled as neocolonialists and this history is forgotten .
You can still hear snippets of the old right - wing scripts in today 's attacks on the mainline churches .
James V. Heidinger II , the president of Good News , the United Methodist Church 's renewal movement which opposes gay ordination and supports conservative theology , tarred official Methodist churches as lacking " a theology of mission but has bought into liberation theology .
Mission for them involves bringing about social and political change in third world countries .
They favor social ministry at the expense of evangelism . " [ 10 ]
Similarly , IRD 's executive director , Mark Tooley , recently sought an apology from the NCC and World Council of Churches for supporting " Marxist " revolutionaries in Africa .
His organization is a lead force in mobilizing renewal movements like Heidinger 's to use African leaders and the debate about gay ordination and marriage as a wedge in U.S. mainline conflicts – IRD 's latest but perhaps most effective tactic in diminishing the social witness of its mainline church opponents ( for more on the U.S. conflict , see box 3 and my recent report , Globalizing the Culture Wars : U.S. Conservatives , African Churches , and Homophobia ) . [ 11 ]
The torrential flow of conservative Christian resources to Africa helps wash away the memory of their alliances with White regimes .
Through their extensive communication networks in Africa , social welfare projects , Bible schools , and educational materials , U.S. religious conservatives warn of the dangers of homosexuals and present themselves as the true representatives of U.S. evangelicalism , effectively marginalizing mainline U.S. churches that once had strong relationships on the continent .
Right - wing groups have enticed African religious leaders to reject funding from mainline denominations – which require documentation of how the money is spent – and instead to accept funds from conservatives , further empowering the U.S. evangelical viewpoint while giving local bishops the opportunity to line their pockets .
To reach Africans , U.S. evangelicals now broadcast their Christian Broadcasting Network ( CBN ) and Trinity Broadcasting Network ( TBN ) throughout sub-Saharan Africa .
Although generally disinterested in helping poor Blacks in their own backyard , in Africa U.S.
White conservatives driven to convert the continent dominate social services , run orphanages , schools and universities , and provide loans . [ 12 ]
These conservatives and evangelical charities like World Vision , Solar Light for Africa , and the IRD - founded Five Talents use their presence in Africa to address the question of homosexuality from a conservative albeit misleading position .
In this way , almost all U.S. conservative Christians working in Africa are responsible for exporting homophobia to Africa .
Indeed , Africans do not distinguish between moderate evangelicals in World Vision and Hard Right figures like Scott Lively .
For them , the term " evangelical " conveys the notion of Protestant Christianity as a whole , without the substantive distinctions made by U.S. religious groups .
And U.S. conservative evangelicals support diverse Anglican , Presbyterian and Pentecostal church leadership in Africa with which they share no denominational tie .
For instance , the Providence Christian Reformed Church in Holland , Michigan is not an Episcopal congregation yet it provides funding to the Anglican Church of Uganda . [ 13 ]
Some U.S. support goes directly to salaries , and has since 1998 , as Reverend Aaron Mwesigyi of the Ugandan archibishop 's office explained . [ 14 ]
Opposing Mainline Witness
While U.S. evangelicals are actively disseminating their antigay views through their mission work , American mainline renewal movements reach out to African churches for support in fights against gay ordination and marriage , helping to further crystallize this as an African issue .
At their behest , Anglican churches in Uganda , Kenya , and Nigeria rejected funding from The Episcopal Church USA in 2004 over disagreements about gay ordination and other culture war issues .
While these attacks have resulted in schisms within the Episcopal Church USA and the Presbyterian Church USA and continue to threaten the unity of the United Methodist Church , they offer African churches financial and ideological benefits , including a voice in international circles .
As Kenya 's Rosemary Mbongo told me , " Africans , Asians , and Latin American evangelical Christians have the voice today ; they owe it to American conservatives . "
Although conservative circles celebrate this rejection of aid as a sign of Africans ' moral purity , Africans simply responded to U.S. conservatives ' demands .
A Kenyan professor noted , " American conservatives have been in my office several times requesting that we cut ties with The Episcopal Church USA and other progressive funders in exchange for their funds .
They have succeeded in getting small colleges into their camp but we have refused . " [ 15 ]
The apparent plan is to encourage African church leaders to swap their relationships with mainline churches for U.S. conservative organizations and individuals .
While it is largely U.S. evangelical money displacing mainline funds supporting African churches , renewal movements within mainline U.S. churches reap the rewards by securing the alliance of Africans in fighting their battles over gay ordination and other issues at home and in international venues .
This effort started as early as 1999 , when members of the IRD - affiliated renewal movement in The Episcopal Church USA went to Africa to ask African bishops to support suspending the American church from the worldwide Anglican Communion for being too gay friendly and socially liberal .
More recently , IRD and United Methodist Church renewal groups organized African delegates to prevent the United Methodist Church from lifting its ban on the ordination of LGBT clergy during its global General Conference in 2008 .
Jerald Walz of IRD put it this way , " Wherever there is theological agreement , Americans are making ways of helping their brothers and sisters both financially and theologically …
In the UMC , Americans reached out to the African delegates by helping them navigate the system ...
Americans are also reaching out to their African friends by giving them a voice at international gatherings . " [ 16 ]
Africa 's attacks on U.S. mainline churches intensified when The Episcopal Church USA consecrated an openly gay person , Gene Robinson , as a bishop in 2004 .
On the surface , Bishop Robinson 's consecration was an Episcopal issue .
However , renewal movements in the Episcopal , United Methodist , and Presbyterian churches , and other U.S. conservatives used it as an organizing tool to preach hatred against LGBT people .
In addition to citing Robinson as an example of Western corruption , they partnered with African religious leaders to demand that the Episcopal Church USA be excommunicated from the worldwide Anglican Communion and replaced with conservative leadership .
The churches then used their " principled " rejection of mainline money as a fundraising opportunity .
In appeals to U.S. conservatives , Canon Allison Barfoot said the Anglican church of Uganda in Kampala lacked working phones because it had rejected money from the Episcopal Church USA . [ 17 ]
Two years after the Anglican Church of Kenya cut ties with the Episcopal Church USA in 2004 , the Reverend Canon Rosemary Mbogo , its Provincial Mission coordinator , appealed for tithing from U.S. evangelical churches " to help the Kenyan province . " [ 18 ]
Their requests to U.S. conservatives appear to have been answered , since both churches confirmed that U.S. conservatives provide regular funding to churches in both countries .
U.S. evangelical money is attractive because it does not come with the demands for strict accountability made by mainline churches . [ 19 ]
Bishops can spend it as they like .
Ironically , U.S. conservatives have always campaigned against " unrestricted " giving in U.S. mainline churches .
But in Africa , they prefer unrestricted giving as another way of undermining progressives .
Local fears that this lack of accountability breeds corruption appear well grounded .
Canon Alison Barfoot , an American conservative , administers American funding at the Anglican Church of Uganda headquarters without giving African accountants any access to U.S. - related financial information or books , we learned . [ 20 ]
Furthermore , dissident U.S. Episcopal Bishop John Guernsey of Woodbridge , Virginia , vets all U.S. donations and mission partnerships with Uganda to ensure they come from " friendly " churches , and other U.S. conservatives play that role for other countries , bypassing usual safeguards . [ 21 ]
Their safeguards are loose enough that Bishop Samuel Sekadde , the retired Bishop of Namirembe , is under suspicion for alleged misuse of church funds . [ 22 ]
The independent Uganda Monitor observed that the bishop 's estates and private home suggest that " the good bishop was either living beyond his means or helping himself to church property . " [ 23 ]
Neocolonial relationship
Despite historical evidence of homosexuality in Africa long before the Europeans arrived , most conservative African religious and political leaders now view homosexuality as a Western export , and a form of imperialism and neocolonialism .
And of course , U.S. conservatives exploit and encourage this belief .
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni , whose wife is a close ally of Rick Warren , warned , " It is a danger not only to the believers but to the whole of Africa .
It is bad if our children become complacent and think that people who are not in order are alright …
These foreigners should go and practice their nonsense elsewhere . " [ 24 ]
Because Africans are sensitive to neocolonialism , the conservative claim that homosexuality is part of a " Western agenda " gives African church leaders ammunition to demand greater influence and power in the affairs of the church . [ 25 ]
Denouncing homosexuality is Africa 's way of claiming power over the western world .
In this regard , when Africans claim that homosexuality is un-African , they are pointing to a politics of postcolonial identity . [ 26 ]
This history gives the struggle greater depth and tenacity , and for that reason , African involvement in U.S. church issues will continue .
Moreover , rejecting what is claimed to be an imposition from the West gives them power both within the African context and with American conservatives of all persuasions .
Ironically enough , although American conservatives repeatedly accuse progressives of being imperialist , it is their dealings with Africa that are extremely imperialistic .
Their flow of funds creates a form of clientelism , with the expectation that the recipients toe an ideological line .
They put words into the mouths of their African church allies , even writing or rewriting their anticolonial statements to reflect U.S. conservative concerns .
In one of many examples , IRD reworked a statement Rev. Jerry Kulah of Liberia wrote in preparation for a 2008 Methodist conference to use as a general African statement , adding in its anti-Islamic politics ,
Cognizant of the massive silent invasion of Islam upon global community with its excessively and liberal use of Arab - oil funds to propagate its faith , we are afraid that the current unrestricted embrace of liberalism within the United Methodist Church is endangering the chances of our children of not considering Christianity as a possibility .
It creates a breeding ground for the rapid expansion of Islam among our future posterity . " [ italics indicate IRD changes ] [ 27 ]
In contrast , U.S. mainline churches repeatedly demonstrate their opposition to neocolonialism of all sorts , not least by supporting the U.N. 's Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) to fight poverty in postcolonial Africa .
Yet American conservatives succeed in dismissing such efforts as neocolonial attempts to bribe Africans into accepting homosexuality , which they characterize as a purely Western phenomenon .
Sadly , the sensitivity of mainline church leaders in the United States to charges of colonialism can silence them from speaking out on LGBT issues .
The African attacks create a dilemma for them :
How can they be relevant to their own global North context , while remaining connected to global mainline Christianity ?
Unfortunately , the fear of isolation leads many social and theological progressives in the church to ignore social justice issues in their daily proclamations .
While Episcopalians risked schism to support gay bishops , U.S. Presbyterian and Methodist churches do not openly ordain LGBT clergy .
African clergy directly threatened to cut links with Presbyterians in 2004 if they did .
Despite the active role American progressives played and continue to play in Africa , they were out - organized .
The Attack on Islam
Another U.S. conservative ploy is to suggest that mainline churches ' acceptance of homosexuality puts African Christian witness at a competitive disadvantage with Islam in winning converts .
Thus U.S. conservatives whip up concerns about Muslims and homosexuals simultaneously in their attacks on mainline churches ' social witness .
Alan Wisdom , the Director of Presbyterian renewal group Action for Faith and Freedom , observed that the U.S. mainline churches ' " desire to dialogue with Islam ignores the plights of the Christian minorities in Islamic nations . " [ 28 ]
In November 2008 , Jim Tonkowich , then IRD president , announced that his group was " beginning a project to research how the actions of the Episcopal Church promoting homosexuality is negatively impacting Christians in Africa who live within and alongside Muslim cultures . " [ 29 ]
In a February 2009 telephone interview , Faith McDonnell , the Director of IRD 's Religious Liberty Programs and of the Church Alliance for a New Sudan , explained ,
Islam prohibits homosexuality … Radical Muslims would use it as another reason for attacking Christians who would be viewed as infidels …
We are competing with Islam in Africa .
Muslims are going to use the argument that Africans are part of the wider communion which accepts homosexuality .
It has happened in the Sudan where one Bishop has already formed the Reformed Episcopal Church by appealing to the argument that he is not part of the Church of homosexuals .
Homosexuality hampers the witness of the Christian witness in Africa .
When asked whether IRD and its allied renewal movements had evidence for such claims , McDonnell replied , " We do not have any empirical evidence yet .
This is solely what Christians are thinking and it is damaging the witness among Christians . "
However , even African religious conservatives discount this idea and there is no evidence for it in Uganda , Kenya , or Nigeria .
One senior clergyman in Kenya told me , " Such an argument does not make sense … Islam has been part of the African heritage in Kenya .
My grandfather was Muslim and on his death bed he was baptized by his son who was the Bishop . "
Similarly Paul Ssembiro , the Mission Coordinator in Archbishop Orombi's office observed , " Uganda 's opposition to homosexuality has nothing to do with Islam .
I do n't think it is has anything to do with the Islamic faith . "
The Kenyan Anglican priest Michael Kimindu noted that this argument is intended to " elicit support from U.S. conservatives concerned about radical Islam . "
Indeed , Archbishop Orombi has cooperated with Muslims in attacking LGBT people in Uganda .
But in 2007 he told his American allies what they wanted to hear : Muslims are attempting to conquer " not so much by the sword but by the dollar .
Muslims also are offering vocal opposition to laws that protect women 's rights because … ‘ these are not in the Koran . ' " [ 30 ]
Conclusion
The relationship between U.S. conservatives and African religious leaders is inhibiting the right of LGBT people to live freely and without persecution both in the United States and Africa .
In Africa , people 's lives are threatened not only by vigilantism but by government action .
If we agree that African churches should be allowed to map their own agenda in the global church , then the conservatives should let go of Africa .
Unfortunately , they will not , at least not without a fight .
It is important that progressive activists in mainline churches are now taking the fight to conservatives and putting them on the defensive at home .
In the United Methodist Church , progressives managed to expose IRD and renewal movements ' attempt to influence African delegates to the 2008 international church gathering by giving out cellphones .
In the Episcopal Church , progressives exposed the presence of conservative lobbyists at international Anglican conferences .
They are also making new inroads with African religious leaders .
It is a positive sign that the Archbishop of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan and the Congo as well as bishops from West Africa traveled to the United States to attend the 2009 General Convention of Episcopal Church USA .
Not only did American progressives represent their positions in their own words , the African leaders were able to explore the American church 's intentions in Africa .
Most of the African bishops pointed to poverty as one of the biggest challenges Africa faces and sought the church 's support in antipoverty struggles – even though the Episcopal Church lifted the moratorium on blessing of same sex marriages and ordination of gays and lesbians to the office of the bishop .
Although not all agreed with the position taken by the Episcopal Church on LGBT issues , African bishops were generally sympathetic with their U.S. colleagues on the matter .
The campaign challenging Rick Warren to denounce the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda – which he still has not done -- is another example of taking the fight to America .
Because the U.S. Right is so skillful at twisting the mainline church statements in Africa as colonial interference , these challenges on conservatives ' home territory provide vital support for LGBT Africans under attack .
We must make sure that they are not collateral damage in the U.S. culture wars .

Why the MSM loves Palin
Fox News has been making a serious charge about mainstream political reporters :
They hate Sarah Palin .
This is not just wrong ; it ’s absurd .
The reality is exactly the opposite : We love Palin .

And if Palin does not exactly love us , she ’s smart enough to recognize how quickly reporters devour every provocative remark she utters .
She knows how to exploit our weakness to guarantee herself exposure far out of proportion to her actual influence in Republican politics .
It ’s a tangled , symbiotic affair — built on mutual dependency and mutual enabling .
For the media , Palin is great at the box office .
Among modern American political figures , she is second only to Barack Obama in generating clicks ( for websites such as this one ) and ratings ( for the cable news networks hungering around the clock for fresh material ) .
For Palin , the benefit is the exposure she needs to maintain her public profile and stir up chatter about a potential presidential candidacy — both of which help her continue to rake in millions of dollars in speaking fees .
She also gets a villain with which to further energize her supporters :
The more she convinces them “ the MSM ” hates her , the more they love her .
The problem is that this relationship — what in Hollywood they call being “ frenemies ” — treats Palin as though she were the central figure in the politics of 2012 .
No realistic appraisal of Palin ’s current strengths and weaknesses or of the history of Republican politics suggests that this is necessarily true .
A new poll out Thursday should make those of us in the media take a look in the mirror and ask :
Should we really be giving so much attention to somebody who faces so many hurdles to becoming president or even the GOP nominee in 2012 ?
According to The Washington Post / ABC survey , she is viewed favorably by 37 percent of Americans , while 55 percent view her unfavorably .
That ’s what pollsters call being “ upside down , ” which for an incumbent would usually spell defeat .
Furthermore , only a quarter of those polled said Palin was qualified to be president — and 71 percent said she was not .
What ’s more , 52 percent of self - identified Republicans — more than half — said she was n’t qualified to be president .
Similar polls of Republicans do n’t place her first nationally .
At this early stage of the race , it 's the " undecided " option that polls highest .
Also still strong is former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee .
Remember him ?
You would n’t know it from the coverage , but some Republicans still prefer him to Palin .
Take a recent poll of Republicans in Alabama , a deeply conservative state where Palin should be strong .
Huckabee leads her by 10 percentage points there .
Beyond polls , consider this :
If Palin were to announce a bid for the White House , how many party officials would support her ?
Would a single governor or senator get behind her candidacy ?
More than 10 House members ?
And how about donors — how many of the bundlers who seeded President Bush ’s two campaigns would do the same for her ?
Before you can scream “ but those are just elites ! ” recall the traditions of the GOP .
Yes , she could mount an insurgency and run against the powerbrokers in Washington and the state capitals who traditionally control the nominating process .
But has that ever happened in the modern history of the Republican Party ?
Just ask Presidents Huckabee ( 2008 ) McCain ( 2000 ) , Buchanan ( ’92 and ’ 96 ) and Robertson ( ’88 ) .
But how about Ronald Reagan , Palin ’s supporters might respond .
Yes , he was the conservative outsider in 1976 ( when he lost , as did all GOP presidential contenders ) .
But he was also a two - term governor of America ’s largest state who worked diligently between that year and his successful run in 1980 to court the media and convert his opponents , holding scores of news conferences and interviews and even stumping for such Ford supporters as James A. Baker III in the 1978 cycle .
With a cadre of political and policy operatives around him , he launched detailed attacks on President Carter over wonky issues such as arms control , détente and the Panama Canal via policy speeches , a syndicated column and a daily radio program .
In short , he did the opposite of what Palin is doing now .
Do n’t believe us — read conservative Craig Shirley ’s new book about the 1980 election , “ Rendezvous With Destiny . ”
Could Palin raise money somehow other than by leaning on deep - pocketed donors to persuade them to bundle checks from their friends and clients ?
Absolutely .
But even Obama ’s fundraising juggernaut — described in the mythology of the ’08 election as a machine built on small - dollar contributions — was a product of wealthy donors and industry .
She did n’t exactly make a major push , but Palin ’s PAC haul last year was not , for somebody of her celebrity , all that impressive .
She raised just over $ 2 million in 2009 and started the year with less than $ 1 million on hand .
By comparison , Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty raised $ 1.3 million in just the final three months of the year , and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney hauled in nearly $ 3 million last year .
As for party support , most GOP officials and operatives are loath to discuss Palin on the record .
When a reporter forces them to speak about her , as one of us did last November at a Republican Governors Association conference , it tends to provoke much staring at shoes , hemming and hawing and ultimately some form of praise about the “ energy ” she brings to the party .
During an interview last year , former Vice President Dick Cheney , asked about rising talent in the GOP , did n’t even mention Palin ’s name until prompted — a pattern among senior Republicans .
The recent book “ Game Change ” by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin even reported that Cheney told friends that John McCain ’s selection of her as running mate was a “ reckless choice . "
In Virginia and New Jersey last fall , neither Republican gubernatorial candidate even wanted her in his state , for fear images of them with the polarizing Palin would scare moderate voters .
( When asked about his arm 's - length approach , Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell offered the tortured rationale that his schedule of surrogate campaigners was set months in advance . )
The hope among GOP elites is that she ’ll keep annoying liberals , raise money for the party — and stay out of the 2012 sweepstakes .
A National Journal survey — an imperfect measurement , to be sure — of some of the party ’s top strategists illustrated this point .
Palin finished fifth among those Republicans the operatives thought would win the party ’s nomination — behind Romney and Pawlenty , as well as Sen. John Thune of South Dakota , Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels .
So why , given her poll standing and the history of the GOP , is she covered so intensely ?
The bitter pill to swallow is that the Palin obsession says as much about the modern media as it does about the state of American politics right now :
We just ca n’t quit her .
To understand the Palin - media love affair , consider her address last weekend at a tea party convention in Nashville .
Every major news outlet had reporters covering her speech to 600 tea party activists .
CNN had a crew of 11 working the event and , along with the other cable news networks , carried her address live .
The speech itself was unremarkable , largely a red - meat regurgitation of the sort of sound - byte - friendly attacks and folksy witticisms she has offered many times before .
Similarly , her “ disclosure ” to Chris Wallace the next morning on “ Fox News Sunday ” was nothing new — she ’s said before she was open to running for president in 2012 .
Still , both the speech and the appearance on Wallace ’s show generated headlines everywhere .
The New York Times and The Washington Post both carried Page 1 stories on Sunday about the speech and the convention , while three of the broadcast networks carried reports on their evening newscasts Monday , some with correspondents reporting from Nashville .
Palin has also received more attention , thanks to the claim Sunday morning by Bill Sammon , Fox News vice president of News and Washington managing editor , that the MSM hates her and the tea parties .
By week 's end , David Broder was talking up her appeal in his Washington Post column , and Time magazine was blasting Joe Klein ’s column declaring her the front - runner for the GOP nomination in 2012 .
Trust us , Broder ’s columns on deficit reduction and Klein ’s pieces on Obama do n’t get circulated around town like those two Palin columns did .
The fact is , she ’s a draw .
The left loves to mock her , the right rushes to defend her and folks in between seem to be fascinated by the whole spectacle .
We see it at POLITICO .
Whenever there is a Palin story or blog post — and , yes , there have been many — the comments pile up in a way that they do on almost no other topic .
And her impact on the airwaves is as significant .
When Palin kicked off her book tour with an appearance on Oprah Winfrey ’s show — a program that never has trouble attracting an audience — the former governor delivered the Queen of Talk her highest ratings in two years .
When Palin made her debut as a Fox News analyst last month on “ The O’Reilly Factor , ” the cable network got 3.9 million viewers — demolishing the competition .
And about that speech at the tea party convention ?
The ratings were nearly double what Fox usually draws for a Saturday evening .
We know we ’re part of the problem — and we ’ll surely continue to run stories about Palin .
But — we ’re looking at you , top newspaper editors and network executives — listen to your grumbling political reporters when they try to tell you why going overboard on the Hockey Mom beat is n’t wise .
Palin is no doubt a phenomenon — she 's going to draw monster crowds and be an in - demand fundraiser for GOP candidates this fall .
And she may overcome her weaknesses to make a run for the White House .
But to cover her as the chief alternative to Obama and the presumptive front - runner for the GOP nomination in 2012 borders on the dishonest .
Yes , she ’s good copy , and yes she ’s good for business .
But that does n’t mean she should be treated as a president in waiting .

Ron Paul suggests that the GOP should be wary of aligning themselves too closely to protesters .
Paul : Tea parties wo n't rebuild GOP
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) said Wednesday night that despite the groundswell of grass - roots conservative energy , the tea party movement is not likely to revive the Republican Party .
“ I do n't think you can talk about the tea party as a party , ” Paul said during an interview with MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow .
“ It ’s made up of a lot of different people .
And I do n't even see them as being Republicans . ”

“ I think they 're unhappy .
They 're unhappy with the establishment party .
And that 's made up of the Republicans and the Democrats , ” Paul said .
“ If the Republicans do n't catch on to that , they can't build their party . ”
Paul is a favorite among the tea party crowd , but the former Republican presidential candidate suggested that the GOP should be wary of aligning themselves too closely to protesters who can be unpredictable in their actions and messaging .
Asked about a recent photo that has been widely circulated in the liberal blogosphere showing a prominent tea party organizer from Houston holding up a sign with incendiary racial language , Paul said the tea parties sometimes “ act too angrily , and it does n't come off well . ”
“ If they keep doing that , yes , it may not necessarily build the party , ” Paul said .
Knowledgeable sources tell Whispers that Brown has raised over $ 1 million every single day this week .
And that 's just from online contributions .
More contributions are arriving in the mail , said the sources .
Much of that money is expected to go into TV ads this weekend , just days before the election Tuesday that pits state senator Brown against longtime Democratic State Attorney General Martha Coakley .
That spending will probably settle the stomachs of some in the national party who've thought that the National Republican Senatorial Committee has erred in not running its own ads to counter some by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
Party sources say Brown has had such success raising money for his own media campaign that the NRSC has n't had to buy advertising time and is spending its money elsewhere to support him .
Amazon SimpleDB has launched today with a new set of features giving the customer more control over which consistency and concurrency models to use in their database operations .
There are now conditional put and delete operations as well a new " consistent read " option .
These new features will make it easier to transition those applications to SimpleDB that are designed with traditional database tools in mind .
Revisiting the Consistency Challenges
Architecting distributed systems that need to reliably operate at world - wide scale is not a simple task .
There are many factors that come into play when you need to meet stringent availability and performance requirements under ultra-scalable conditions .
I laid out some of these challenges in an article explaining the concept of eventual consistency .
If you need to achieve high - availability and scalable performance , you will need to resort to data replication techniques .
But replication in itself brings a whole set of challenges that need to be addressed .
For example updates to data now needs to happen in several locations , so what do you do if one or more of those locations is ( temporarily ) not accessible ?
A whole field of computer science is dedicated to finding solutions for the hard problems of building reliable distributed systems .
Eric Brewer of UC Berkeley summarized these challenges in what has been called the CAP Theorem , which states that of the three properties of shared - data systems -- data consistency , system availability , and tolerance to network partitions -- only two can be achieved at any given time .
In practice the possibility of network partitions is a given , so the real trade - off is between availability and consistency :
In a system that needs to be highly available there are a number of scenarios under which consistency cannot be guaranteed and for a system that needs to be strongly consistent , there are a number of scenarios under which availability may need to be sacrificed .
These trade - off scenarios generally involve edge conditions that almost never happen , but in a system that needs to operate at massive scale serving trillions and trillions of requests on a daily basis , one needs to be prepared to handle these cases .
Next to this fundamental tension between availability and consistency , there is also a trade - off between concurrency , performance and consistency .
Achieving strict consistency can come at a cost in update or read latency , and may result in lower throughput .
Developers should be aware of these trade - offs , as they are not simply an esoteric concept only impacting the internals of the system .
Rather , the consistency model of the underlying service will have explicit downstream effects on the developer 's application .
Data Consistency Models in the Amazon Services
Within Amazon we strongly favor the use of services that are highly - available and as such we are willing to deal with a relaxed form of consistency called eventual consistency .
Our applications are designed to handle this consistency model and there are many cases where this has allowed us to architect services and applications that can meet the most stringent reliability requirements .
Amazon S3 and Amazon SimpleDB are examples of AWS services that are designed using these high - availability principles using an eventual consistency model .
Our customers have been able to handle this consistency model as well and have built scalable and reliable applications on top of these services .
Now that these services have been in operation for quite some time we have received feedback from a number of our advanced customers asking whether they could get more control over the trade - offs made by the service architects , specifically over the consistency of the read operations .
Under the eventual consistency model there is the possibility of stale reads , while in a strongly consistent model reads always returns the latest update , though with the potential for a performance penalty and lower availability under certain rare partition scenarios .
Two new features released today by Amazon SimpleDB put control over the consistency model in the hands of the customers .
The first is the ability for customers to perform a Consistent Read , which will prevent the read operation from possibly returning stale data .
The second is a Conditional Put and Delete which will ensure that these operations are only performed if certain attribute values are matched .
These new features will make it easier for traditional database application scenarios such as concurrency control , item counters , conditional update / delete , etc. , to be implemented using Amazon SimpleDB .
Consistent Read
Until recently SimpleDB only supported eventually consistent reads .
This meant that under certain conditions a read , for a small period of time , may not reflect the result of a recently completed write .
Yet there is a class of applications that would be much easier to implement if reads would reflect the outcome of writes performed prior to the read .
In order to facilitate building such applications SimpleDB now also supports a strong consistency option called consistent read which will reflect all writes successfully returned prior to that read .
Especially those applications that originally were designed with a traditional database in mind will be easier to adapt to Simple DB .
Select & GetAttributes request parameters now include an optional Boolean flag ConsistentRead which is set to false by default .
If ConsistentRead is absent or set to false , SimpleDB will default to an eventually consistent read .
If ConsistentRead is set to true , SimpleDB will return a consistent read .
The table below summarizes the characteristics of the two SimpleDB read consistency options :
Eventually consistent read Consistent read Stale reads possible
Lowest read latency
Highest read throughput
No stale reads
Higher read latency
Lower read throughput
Since a consistent read may incur higher latency and lower read throughput it should only be used when an application scenario mandates returning the very latest value of an item or attribute .
For all other scenarios an eventually consistent read will yield the best performance .
Conditional Put and Delete
Many developers have asked for primitives in SimpleDB for implementing optimistic concurrency control , item level transactions , locks , counters , etc .
The new conditional puts and deletes feature in SimpleDB enables building these primitives .
Conditional
Puts allow inserting or replacing values of one or more attributes for a given item if the expected consistent value of a single - valued attribute matches the specified expected value .
Conditional puts are a mechanism to eliminate lost updates caysed by concurrent writers writing to the same item as long as all concurrent writers use conditional updates .
Conditional deletes allow deleting an item , an attribute or an attribute 's value for a given item if the expected consistent value of a single - valued attribute of an item matches the specified expected value .
If the current value does not match the expected value , or if the attribute is gone altogether , the delete is rejected .
What about availability
Even though SimpleDB now enables operations that support a stronger consistency model , under the covers SimpleDB remains the same highly - scalable , highly - available , and highly durable structured data store .
Even under extreme failure scenarios , such as complete datacenter failures , SimpleDB is architected to continue to operate reliably .
However when one of these extreme failure conditions occurs it may be that the stronger consistency options are briefly not available while the software reorganizes itself to ensure that it can provide strong consistency .
Under those conditions the default , eventually consistent read will remain available to use .
Summary
By providing developers control over the consistency model , they are now empowered to make the consistency and performance trade - offs .
This flexibility is important in scenarios where they need to adapt existing applications that have been designed with a traditional database operational model in mind .
Developers can now choose to use a consistent read approach if their application can accept the trade - offs .
And with conditional put and delete , developers have the ability to use an optimistic concurrency control approach to managing their database .

Shown in an extremely broad range of color and showcasing more than twelve billion years of cosmic history , Hubble 's recent image is a full - glory cosmic renaissance of the history of the Universe .
The image provides a record of the Universe 's most exciting formative years , from the birth of stars in the early Universe all the way through the materialization of the Milky Way .
Constructed from mosaics taken with the newly installed Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) in fall 2009 and Hubble Space Telescope 's Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) taken in 2004 , the final image combines a broad range of colors , from the ultraviolet , through visible light , into the near infrared .
Such a detailed multi-color view of the Universe has never before been assembled at such a level of clarity , accuracy , and depth .
" It 's like taking off rose - colored glasses and seeing the Universe in a whole new light , and what we 're seeing is fantastic , " says Rogier Windhorst , a professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration , an academic unit of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Arizona State University , and a member of the WFC3 Science Oversight Committee .
" We 're seeing stars on a galactic scale being born , we 're seeing galaxies in formation , galaxies replenished with new fuel for making stars ; we 're seeing a messy Universe , a Universe in action , and we 're seeing it like astronomers have never seen it before . "
Hubble 's sharp resolution and new color versatility , accomplished by combining data from the two cameras , is allowing astronomers to sort out the various stages of galaxy assembly , from the mature spiral and elliptical galaxies in the foreground , to smaller , fainter , irregularly shaped galaxies that are in general farther away , and hence existed farther back into time .
These smaller galaxies are considered the building blocks of the larger galaxies that we see today .
The wide range of new colors now observed with WFC3 also allows astronomers to estimate a galaxy 's distance from Earth , and reveal information about its stellar populations .
Acquiring this image was much more time intensive than simply pointing and shooting .
The data that comes off the telescope is in a raw form that requires processing .
The Science Oversight Committee designed a science program to test and demonstrate the science capabilities of the WFC3 , referred to as Early Release Science ( ERS ) data .
Windhorst and students in the School of Earth and Space Exploration have been involved in the processing and analyzing the ERS data , spending the better part of July and August calibrating the data and removing background artifacts .
" Certain instrumental effects and cosmetic problems have to be taken out , " explains Seth Cohen , a postdoctoral research associate in SESE .
" Some artifacts are due to cosmic rays or satellites , while others are due to the detectors themselves .
You have to remove all these things before you can do the science .
You do n't want to mistake the residual effects of these in your image if they are not due to something in your galaxy of interest . "
" Your eye is very good at picking out the artifacts , but you have to train a computer to do this and use software to reduce these out , " says Michael Rutkowski , a graduate student in SESE who has worked on prepping the image .

The image shows a rich tapestry of 7,500 galaxies stretching back through most of cosmic history .
The closest galaxies seen in the foreground emitted their observed light only 0.9 billion years ago .
The farthest galaxies , a few of the very faint red specks , are seen as they appeared more than 13 billion years ago , or roughly 650 million years after the Big Bang .
This mosaic spans a slice of space that is 10 arc minutes across in its largest diameter , or about one third of the diameter of the full Moon in the sky .
The new Hubble view highlights a wide variety of stages in the galaxy assembly process .
The WFC3 ultraviolet light shows the blue glow of hot , young stars in galaxies teeming with star - birth .
The orange light reveals the nearly final assembly stages of massive galaxies about 8 to 10 billion years ago .
The near infrared reveals the red glow of very distant galaxies --- in a few cases as far as 12 -- 13 billion light years away --- whose light has been stretched , like a toy Slinky , from ultraviolet light to longer - wavelength infrared light due to the expansion of the Universe .
The region covers a portion of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey 's ( GOODS ) Southern field , first observed by Hubble with the ACS in 2004 , and now with Hubble 's new WFC3 from Sept. -Oct. 2009 .
In this ambitious use of Hubble 's observing time , the 2004 ACS exposures totaled over 100 orbits in the optical in this portion of the sky , and the new WFC3 exposures total 104 orbits in the ultraviolet and near - infrared .
The image was made from a mosaic of 2x4 WFC3 ultraviolet pointings , and 2x5 WFC3 near - infrared pointings .
In just two orbits per pointing , the WFC3 peered deeper into the Universe than comparable near - infrared observations from ground - based telescopes .
This set of unique new Hubble observations reveals galaxies to about 27th magnitude in brightness over a factor of 10 in wavelength .
" Having this broad spectrum wavelength coverage allows us to do many different things that we could n't do before without having deep observations at all these wavelengths at the Hubble resolution , " says Cohen .
Astronomers are using this multi-color panorama to trace many details of galaxy formation over cosmic time : the star - formation rate in galaxies , the rate of mergers among galaxies , and the abundance of weak active galactic nuclei , along with many other measurable quantities .
Rutkowski is most excited about the panchromatic nature , particularly the UV capabilities since UV astronomy can't be done from the ground .
" My interest is in elliptical galaxies known as " red and dead galaxies . "
We believed that there was n't much going on by way of current star formation in these galaxies , but as the UV becomes more accessible , there are a lot of red and dead galaxies that are actually quite blue .
This image suggests that they 're neither as red nor as dead as we originally thought . "
A brain - imaging study conducted at the U.S. Department of Energy 's ( DOE ) Brookhaven National Laboratory provides the first definitive evidence that patients suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) have lower - than - normal levels of certain proteins essential for experiencing reward and motivation .
" These deficits in the brain 's reward system may help explain clinical symptoms of ADHD , including inattention and reduced motivation , as well as the propensity for complications such as drug abuse and obesity among ADHD patients , " said lead author Nora Volkow , Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and a long - time collaborator on neuroimaging research at Brookhaven Lab .
The study , published in the September 9 , 2009 , issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association , also has important implications for treatment .
" Finding ways to address the underlying reward - system deficit could improve the direct clinical outcome of ADHD , and potentially reduce the likelihood of other negative consequences of this condition , " said study co-author Gene - Jack Wang , chair of Brookhaven 's medical department .
Prior to this study , it was not clear whether people with ADHD had abnormalities in the brain 's dopamine - mediated motivation / reward system .
Previous studies were relatively small and may have been complicated by the fact that some ADHD patients had undergone treatments , or had a history of drug abuse or other conditions that can affect the dopamine system .
To strengthen the statistics and control for these factors , the current study looked at 53 adult ADHD patients who had never received treatment and 44 healthy control subjects — all of whom had been carefully screened to eliminate potentially confounding variables .
The scientists used positron emission tomography ( PET ) to measure two markers of the dopamine system — dopamine receptors , to which the chemical messenger binds to propagate the " reward " signal , and dopamine transporters , which take up and recycle excess dopamine after the signal is sent .

Lying in a PET scanner , each patient was injected with a minute amount of a " radiotracer " compound — a chemical labeled with a radioactive form of carbon and designed to bind specifically to one of the targets .
Different tracers were used for each target , and patients were scanned for each at separate times .
By detecting the signal from the radiotracers , the PET machine can measure the receptor and transporter locations and concentrations in various parts of the brain .
The results clearly showed that , relative to the healthy control subjects , the ADHD patients had lower levels of dopamine receptors and transporters in the accumbens and midbrain — two key regions of the brain directly involved in processing motivation and reward .
In addition , the measurements of dopamine markers correlated with measures of behavior and clinical observations of ADHD symptoms , such as reduced levels of attention as measured by standard psychological tests .
" Our findings imply that these deficits in the dopamine reward pathway play a role in the symptoms of inattention in ADHD and could underlie these patients ' abnormal responses to reward , " Volkow said .
" This pathway plays a key role in reinforcement , motivation , and in learning how to associate various stimuli with rewards , " she continued .
" Its involvement in ADHD supports the use of interventions to enhance the appeal and relevance of school and work tasks to improve performance .
" Our results also support the continued use of stimulant medications — the most common pharmacological treatment for ADHD — which have been shown to increase attention to cognitive tasks by elevating brain dopamine , " she said .
The findings may also help explain why ADHD patients are more likely than control subjects to develop drug - abuse disorders and conditions such as obesity .
Said Wang : " Other studies from our group suggest that patients who abuse drugs or overeat may be unconsciously attempting to compensate for a deficient reward system by boosting their dopamine levels .
Understanding how deficits in the dopamine system contribute to ADHD and finding ways to improve the functioning of the reward system could help mitigate these troubling consequences in the ADHD patient population . "
This research was supported by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Intramural Research Program and by the National Institute on Mental Health .
The Office of Biological and Environmental Research within DOE's Office of Science provides infrastructure support for the radiotracer chemistry and imaging facilities at Brookhaven Lab .
Brain - imaging techniques such as PET are a direct outgrowth of DOE 's long - standing investment in basic research in chemistry , physics , and nuclear medicine .

I hate to see things like that happen , but was immensely relieved – as it meant that after an incredibly rough start , the trip was finally getting on track and shaping up to be what I ’d paid for .
Our group of 8 set off towards the cave mouth in the lead , pausing briefly to snap pictures and take in the site ’s incredible beauty .
The milky blue - green water , moss - covered rocks , and lush jungle served as an incredible backdrop for a somewhat intimidating start to our cave voyage .
We received a brief safety lecture , a quick warning not to get our headlamps wet , and a reminder that we’d be getting wet before moving towards the entrance to the cave .
At the lead , I was n’t quite sure what to expect .
I ’d been told I ’d need to swim across the cave mouth , but was skeptical .
I ’m 6 ’ 4 ″ – over a foot taller than most of the Mayans .
It could n’t be that deep , could it ?
The 78 degree water prickled up my legs .
Cold enough for a quick intake of breath , but not quite cold enough to be truly unpleasant .
The water was mineral rich , and as a result a murky green .
I slowly made my way forward as the bottom gave out beneath me .
I quickly found myself swimming , camera in hand , across a portal into another world .
Once across , I crawled my way up onto a flat area , before stepping aside to watch as the rest of the group followed in my footsteps .
Once we ’d all gathered , it was once again time to pause for a brief history of the 5 + km deep cave .
It is believed that the Mayans used the cave in some form or another for over 1,000 years before eventually abandoning it around 1000 AD .
After which it sat dormant and unexplored until the 1980s when early explorers re-discovered the ancient Mayan site .
Chomping at the bit , we quickly began to make our way into the cave , carefully – albeit usually quite clumsily – stumbling over rocks , tripping on submerged ledges , and relying heavily on hand holds .
Every so often our guide would issue a word of warning .
Step here , do n’t touch that .
Be careful , it gets deep , etc. – messages which we then transferred dutifully down the line to ensure everyone was kept in the loop .
The cave has n’t been stabilized in any way , shape or form which makes for an , at times , delightfully perilous trip .
The only light we had available came in one of two forms :
The seldom used , hand - held spotlight our guide had and our smaller hard - hat based LED headlamps .
The going was slow , but stunning .
We were almost always in water , though the depth of that water ranged widely .
Most of the time it ran waist deep , though it regularly plunged far deeper , leaving me walking in chest / neck - deep water or carefully clinging to the side of the cave wall as I scooted along seeking slightly shallower ledges .
Unfortunately , my digital camera was locked away in a waterproof bag , however I did shoot video ( attached above ) on my waterproof flip .
As we wound more than half a kilometer into the cave system we paused regularly to examine stunning rock formations .
At times they consisted of odd circular holes carved into the ceiling , other times it was large crystalline sheets which caught , and reflected the glow of our headlamps sparkling like a thousand tiny stars .
All the while the roof ranged from mere inches above my head to large cavernous expanses decorated by stalactites and beautiful , folded , begemmed – almost sheet like – rock pillars .
Eventually we reached a long , narrow cavern with a large , jagged , water worn rock .
The rock rested next to a sheer , overhanging ledge which stood some 10 - 15 feet above water level .
The distance between the rock and the ledge was some 2.5 feet up , and 1.5 feet out .
Just manageable if you were careful , used your height and managed to swallow the sizable lump in your throat that inevitably formed .
One - by - one we made the climb , bridged the small gap , and then scaled another 15 - 20 feet up along a steep , but manageable rock wall , before settling into a small alcove at the top .
There we were instructed to remove our shoes , and don our socks in preparation for the dry leg of the cave .
We set off once again , this time through a tiny , narrow crevice that left me bent nearly in two , as I hop - walked my way through , periodically bouncing my head or shoulder off the rock ceiling .
Once up and out things opened up in a large open area .
The ground was a mixture between slightly water warn rock , and much smoother / softer sandstone .
In the larger open areas the ground was a unique mixture of small depressions where water would normally pool and natural retainer walls which were often semi-circle in nature .
The ground looked in many ways like it was dried and hardened mud sediment , left during mild flooding over hundreds of years .
We quickly learned that the sandstone ’s delicate nature was the reason we ’d been asked to remove our shoes .
Our guide also pointed to several small pieces of red tape laid out on the ground .
He cautioned that those marked artifacts and pleaded with us to be careful .
As we carefully made our way from chamber to chamber – often through narrow / tight / difficult pathways that left me feeling very grateful I was n’t 6 ’ 6 ″ or 50 pounds heavier – we passed a plethora of old Mayan artifacts before eventually arriving at the first skeletal remains .
Each step we took required total attention .
Constantly on the look out for the red tape that market artifacts , we quickly realized that the tape only marked major artifacts .
This forced us to vigilantly navigate between smaller pieces of pottery .
All the while , we carefully avoided stepping in depressions , walking instead along the ridges left between small areas where water had pooled in years past .
These were raised and tended to be more durable than the depressions which also potentially contained submerged / undiscovered pottery or skeletal remains encased in the soft sediment .
As we paused our guide told us a bit about the skull that rested , badly battered but largely intact at our feet .
He shared the individual ’s approximate age , sex , and what little had been discovered about the person ’s life and social status .
The chamber stretched out to either side , with a largely smooth floor , before slipping up into beautiful stalactites that decorated the cavern ’s walls .
The stalactites themselves looked like melted wax , leaving me to ponder the incredible beauty of the place .
I can only image the mystical ambiance the cavern would have held in the dim , wavering light of a hand held torch or small fire .
It ’s easy to see how the ancient Mayans – who had somehow navigated nearly a kilometer into the cave , relying only on torches and gusto – would have envisioned the place as a magical portal into the underworld and afterlife .
With stories of Mayan nobles and religious leaders , heavily reliant on hallucinogenic drugs , celebrating bloody rituals racing through our minds we continued to wind further into the cave system .
Past small depressions which held skeletal remains .
Small platforms which supported old pottery .
Turtle shells , various other artifacts and incredible stalactites .
Eventually we paused in the main gallery to snap a few photos and enjoy the sheer scope of the cavern we were in .
There our guide explained that every single piece of pottery found in the cave had been damaged by the Mayans .
Apparently , after each use they Mayans would leave the pottery as a gift for the dead , punching a hole , or damaging it in some way to free the item ’s spirit .
From there it was up , through another series of tight , jagged passages that left us muttering soft curses as we carefully picked our way over , through , between and under sharp rocks and small broken stalactites .
Eventually we came to a near dead - end : A 10 - 15 foot set of large boulders .
The boulders had an old aluminum roof latter set up against them , and stabilized with a small rope at the top .
Its wobbly , frail looking nature , especially set in the dimly lit light of the cave definitely added to the sense of adventure .
We paused briefly , listening all the while to our guide as he told us what to expect : The Crystal Maiden .
A fully intact female skeleton , left as she ’d died over a thousand years previous .
Near her feet in a small depression , easily overlooked was a second , small / collapsed skeleton .
Unlike the maiden who appeared laid out , the 2nd skeleton was in a position that left us all wondering if it had n’t died with its hands and legs bound .
Sacrifice ?
Honored burial for respected elders ?
Ritual self - sacrifice ?
It ’s hard to know .
Eyes glinting in the harsh light cast by our head lamps we paused and reflected before slowly making our way back to the metal latter .
It looked every bit as intimidating as I expected it to …with a resigned sigh , I swung my body weight out over empty nothingness , slowly stabilizing myself against the rocks , before slowly making my way towards the ground , foot by foot , wobbly rung by wobbly rung .
From there it was back through the winding warren of small tunnels and large chambers to the ledge where we ’d left our shoes .
Smiles on our faces and small goose bumps on our arms we donned our shoes and made the difficult descent back over the small gap , down the large rock formation and into the water .
Hours had passed since we ’d entered the cave and though we did n’t know it yet , the sun had already slid below the horizon .
Bats began to migrate over our heads , typically staying well clear of us .
From time to time , however , we ’d find ourselves started by a gray blur , as it spend past our heads often narrowly missing us and leaving us to start at the quick wash of moving air that tugged at our hair .
The water itself held its own mysteries .
As the last three tours in the cave , things were stone quiet .
The air was still , and the animal life was slowly returning to reclaim its territory .
Before long we spotted small catfish , crayfish and even several fist sized freshwater crabs .
An entertaining addition to our group as we waded , swam , and walked back down through the flooded hallways , past ancient stalactites and stalagmites towards the entrance .
Eventually , wet , and slightly cold we reached the mouth of the cave … pausing briefly to make sure we had n’t lost anyone , our guide pointed to two glowing points along the sheer walls of the cave near the entrance .
The first thing to catch our attention was the stunningly beautiful reflection of eyes – star - like in nature .
Then , as our eyes adjusted , the outlines of massive spiders suddenly sprang into focus .
Eager and slightly anxious , I made my way once more into the deep pool at the mouth of the cave .
This time , careful to stay near the center of the chamber – hoping to stay as far away from the spiders as humanly possible .
Drenched , but thrilled I made my way back over the submerged rocks , dinging my shins every now and then , before scrambling out onto the moss slicked stones that marked the mouth of the cave .
There we spotted another large , freshwater crab , before carefully picking our way up the muddy embankment and back onto the main path .
It was dark .
Long past sunset , with a nearly full moon slowly climbing towards apex .
It was stunning .
The sky and moon brilliantly outlined the jungle canopy as it stretched over our heads , allowing slight moonlight to filter down to the jungle floor .
After a quick pause we set off , back to the parking lot and our cars .
We had a 40 minute walk ahead of us , through the dark , in the middle of nowhere , down a small dirt path and across three large rivers .
THIS was the adventure i’d signed up for .
A glowing smile on my face , I began back towards the parking lot , pausing from time to time to let out a sign of amazement .
I mentioned previously that the spider ’s eyes at the cave mouth had been impressive .
As it turns out , the jungle to either side of the path itself was home to thousands of spiders .
All of varying sizes , but sharing the same brilliantly reflective eyes .
As the light struck the path , I could not help but feel as though I was on a path through space , with stars to either side stretching out into space .
Careful not to stray off the path we wandered along for some 20 minutes before suddenly stopping dead in our tracks .
Sitting smack dab in the middle of the path was a giant toad .
No doubt feasting on the veritable spider smorgasbord .
It stared at us briefly before lazily launching itself to the side of the path , and then off into the thick underbrush beyond .
About half way back to the parking lot my headlamp began to blink .
My battery was dieing .
Luckily , the moon was bright , I still had some battery left , and the other two members of the group still had battery power .
Nervously chuckling and wondering what other animal life was roaming the path , we set back to our trek , before eventually finding our way back to the parking lot where we donned warm clothes , piled into one of the guides ’ trucks and set off for San Ignacio .
The trip , which had started out in what looked to be miserable disappointment ended up being one of my favorite experiences in Belize .
If you ever find yourself in Belize , make sure you track down a guide and explore Actun Tunichil Muknal – but hurry !
People were not kidding when they said this site ca n’t last .
There ’s simply too much exposure to the artifacts and remains .
The site needs something more than red electrical tape marking artifacts if there ’s to be any hope of persevering it .
Add to that the rugged and dangerous nature of the tour and there ’s no doubt in my mind that the government will end up shutting it down in the next couple of years .
Simon Cowell has again blasted the campaign to make Rage Against The Machine number one for Christmas , comparing its organisers to Ebenezer Scrooge .
Music fans have launched an attempt to end The X Factor 's dominance over the festive charts by calling for a mass download of the US band 's 1992 single ' Killing In The Name ' .
If the campaigners are successful , 18 - year - old Joe McElderry will be the first X Factor winner in five years to miss out on having the Christmas chart - topper .
Speaking to the Daily Star , Cowell insisted : " We 've got 500,000 singles going out on Wednesday and Joe will be number one .
" Why not let the kid have his moment ?
It 's all very Scrooge .
It 's miserable to put down young talent .
We should celebrate it . "
Initial sales figures released earlier today indicated that Rage Against The Machine had a narrow lead over McElderry .

EPA Proposes Limits on Fertilizer , Animal Waste , and Sewage Pollution in State Waters

While extreme winter weather in parts of Europe , Asia and the US has brought normal life to a virtual standstill for millions of people , many other inhabited places manage to function where such sub -zero temperatures are routine .
In the north - eastern Russian Republic of Sakha ( Yakutia ) , the village of Oymyakon is commonly called the coldest populated place on Earth .
Situated in an area of Siberia nicknamed " Stalin's Death Ring " ( a former destination for political exiles ) , Oymyakon boasts an average winter temperature of - 45C , with a one - time world record low of - 71.2C .
Welcome to Yakutsk
It is home to several hundred people , and until recently a single hotel with no hot water and an outside toilet .
While a flurry of snow in Western Europe can cause schools there to close for days , Oymyakon 's solitary school shuts only when temperatures fall below - 52C ( the school has only enjoyed the luxury of an indoor toilet since 2008 ) .
Most homes in Oymyakon still burn coal and wood for heat and enjoy few modern conveniences - mobile phones , even if a service was available in the area , would not work in such extreme cold .
Nothing grows there , a single shop provides the town 's provisions and with jobs in short supply most locals resort to reindeer - breeding , hunting and ice - fishing for their livelihoods .
Ironically , Oymyakon means " non-freezing water " , situated as it is to a nearby hot spring .
' Do n't wear glasses '
Oymyakon is a three - day drive away from the nearest population centre , Yakutsk , the capital of Sakha and , perhaps unsurprisingly , the coldest city in the world .
More than 210,000 people live there , despite a constant state of permafrost , and temperatures in the winter which average about - 40C .
COLDEST RECORDED PLACES Vostok , Antarctica : - 89.2C Oymyakon , Russia : - 71.1C Verkhoyansk , Russia : - 67.7C Snag , Yukon , Canada : - 63C Prospect Creek , Alaska , US : -62.1C
The city still manages to run , however .
It is served by two airports and is home to a university and several schools , theatres and museums .
Residents reportedly leave their vehicles running all day and warn visitors against wearing glasses outside , as they will freeze to a person 's face .
Yakutsk sits on the western bank of the Lena River , but winters can be so severe that even the river can freeze sufficiently thick to allow traffic to drive straight across to the other side .
Over in the Western hemisphere , extreme cold is also a perennial feature of many towns and cities .
In the United States , International Falls in Minnesota , and Fraser , Colorado , with average mean temperatures around 0 to 2C , have for years vied for the title of Icebox of the Nation .
The battle was only resolved in the courts , with the accolade being awarded to International Falls .
Of the two places , International Falls has recorded the lowest temperature , of - 40C in 1967 .
Not one for decrying the cold , the city celebrates its wintry fame , with an annual four - day Icebox Days festival , which includes events such as frozen turkey bowling , snow sculpting and candlelit skiing .
Tourism is the city 's second most profitable industry , a side - product of freezing conditions not lost on other places which live year - round in the grip of the cold ( such as in the Swedish village of Jukkasjarvi , which boasts the world 's largest ice hotel ) .
Call that cold ?
The title of the consistently coldest place in the US has frequently fallen to the town of Stanley in Idaho , which had the highest number of coldest days between 1995 and 2005 .
While the town 's 100 or so residents enjoy rafting , hiking and fishing in the summer , outdoor pursuits in the winter are confined to snowmobiling and cross-country skiing .
For some , the freezing cold provides an opportunity for an edifying dip
In Europe , Scandinavia regularly sees some of the continent 's coldest weather and as such is well - equipped to deal with it .
Residents who contacted the BBC News website expressed astonishment at the television pictures and stories of the effect the snow is having in places not used to such conditions .
Maija messaged from Mouhijarvi , in western Finland , deriding the weather in Poland , where temperatures have fallen to as low as - 25C .
" Ha !
It 's 5 pm in Mouhijarvi and the thermometer outside our kitchen window is currently reading - 28C .
With no cloud cover in sight I would expect the temperature to fall at least a couple of degrees during the evening .
Not abnormal here at this time of year , " she said .
Briton Roger Hampton said he travelled 250 km from his home in Oslo , Norway , without problems on Wednesday when it was - 22C .
" In the town Roros , in central Norway , it has been - 40 C the last two nights .
I have not heard of schools closing and the roads are for the most free , " he said .
In several European countries , including Norway , the use of winter tyres on vehicles is required by law .
In contrast , in the UK , where no such law exists , during the wintry weather , drivers there are advised to use their vehicles for essential journeys only .
" Why do the English have this problem every year ? " , asks reader Dario More in Germany .
" Here , in Dresden , at - 13C , I drive my car normally on ice and snow , " he says .

Opponents of same - sex marriage think gays and lesbians want to upend the " sanctity " of the institution .
Never mind the fact that straight people have been doing that on their own pretty well .
But we 've never come across a straight couple that aimed to purposefully mock marriage just to prove a political point .
Brian Feldman and Hannah Miller , two Orlando - area residents and complete strangers , were married last Friday .
Feldman , a performance artist , put out a call to any ladies who wanted to take
.
Three showed up , and he spun a water bottle to decide which one with which he would enter into holy matrimony .
The piece even had a name : " Brian Feldman Marries Anybody , " and to complement the piece , a lesbian couple attempted to get a marriage license at the same court an hour beforehand but was denied .
The words of Pope Benedict are among the quotations published
An atheist group in the Irish Republic has defied a new blasphemy law by publishing a series of anti-religious quotations on its website .
Atheist Ireland says it will fight any action taken against it in court .
The quotations include the words of writers such as Mark Twain and Salman Rushdie , but also Jesus Christ , the Prophet Muhammad and Pope Benedict XVI .
The new law makes blasphemy a crime punishable by a fine of up to 25,000 euros ( £ 22,000 ; $ 35,000 ) .
The government says it is needed because the republic 's 1937 constitution only gives Christians legal protection of their beliefs .
The new law was passed in July 2009 but came into force on 1 January .
Atheist Ireland responded by publishing 25 quotes it considers anti-religious on its website .
The group said its aim is to have the law repealed and to attain a secular Irish constitution .
Chairman Michael Nugent said it would challenge the blasphemy law through the courts if it were charged , the London - based Guardian newspaper reported .
" This new law is both silly and dangerous , " he said .
" It is silly because medieval religious laws have no place in a modern secular republic , where the criminal law should protect people and not ideas . "
Atheist Ireland says it will hold a series of public meetings around the country to launch its campaign .

The alkalinity of the Vamsadhara river downstream of the refinery has risen
An alumina refinery in east India run by a UK - based firm is causing pollution that threatens the health of local people , a human rights group says .
Amnesty International said those living near the Lanjigarh refinery in Orissa breathed polluted air and were afraid to drink from or bathe in local rivers .
It called on Vedanta Resources not to expand the refinery or mine for bauxite nearby before resolving the problems .
Vedanta has consistently rejected the allegations against it .
It points out that India 's Supreme Court has approved its initial plans
The firm has previously argued it has support from the state authorities .
But it did not respond immediately when asked for the comment by the BBC on the Amnesty report .
On Friday , the Church of England said it had sold its £ 2.5 m stake in Vedanta .
The Church said it was not satisfied the firm had shown " the level of respect for human rights and local communities that we expect " .
Vedanta said it was disappointed by the Church 's decision and remained " fully committed to pursuing its investments in a responsible manner , respecting the environment and human rights " .
' Blisters '
In a report published on Tuesday , Amnesty International said the Orissa State Pollution Control Board ( OSPCB ) had documented widespread water and air pollution caused by the Lanjigarh refinery since it opened in 2006 , but failed to share it with those affected .
People have a right to water and to a healthy environment but Vedanta has failed to respect these rights in Orissa
Kate Allen
UK Director , Amnesty International
The OSPCB found the alkalinity of the Vamsadhara river downstream of the refinery had increased , and believes the seepage , leakage or discharge of highly alkaline water from its waste storage facilities is responsible , it said .
Drinking slightly alkaline water is not associated with any health problems .
But water with a high pH value can cause irritation of the skin , and exposure to water with a pH level of 12 or above can cause blistering or burns .
" We used to bathe in the river but now I am scared of taking my children there .
Both my sons have had rashes and blisters , " one woman told Amnesty .
Although it was required to ensure " zero discharge " , the OSPCB reports indicated that the refinery had been operating without having put in place all the necessary systems to adequately manage water - borne waste and pollution , the report said .
Vedanta disputes that it is responsible for the river 's alkalinity , saying it may be related to the increased use of fertiliser by famers .
Amnesty said the Lanjigarh refinery was also failing to limit the impact of air pollution on surrounding communities , caused mostly by dust from its bauxite , coal and lime handling areas and ash from its boilers .
Officials are considering a proposal for a six - fold expansion of the refinery Local people told the group how the dust settled in their homes and on their clothes , left deposits on their trees , fruits , crops and water , and even on prepared food .
" I was finding it hard to see before and now this constant dust from the refinery is making it even harder for me to see .
My throat is constantly sore as I inhale so much smoke and dust , " said a woman in Bandaguda , who also described the continuous noise pollution as " mental torture " .
Local health officials told Amnesty that the refinery 's dust emissions were the most likely cause of the respiratory illnesses and discomfort experienced by those living nearby .
The OSPCB also found in 2007 and 2008 that dust emissions were far higher than permitted .
However , Vedanta officials told Amnesty that there was no dust pollution , and a recent government environmental impact assessment stated that levels were within acceptable limits .
Despite the concerns of the villagers , the Indian government is considering a proposal for a six - fold expansion of the refinery .
" People have a right to water and to a healthy environment but Vedanta has failed to respect these rights in Orissa , " said Amnesty 's UK Director Kate Allen .
" Villagers were given scant and misleading information about the potential impact of the alumina refinery and mining project .
Today they are living in the shadow of a massive refinery , breathing polluted air and afraid to drink from and bathe in a river that is one of the main sources of water in the region .
" The Indian government is responsible for protecting the rights of its people , but that does n't absolve Vedanta from responsibility for the damage that it is causing people .
Vedanta must ensure that its existing operations respect human rights before considering any expansion . "
The Dhongria Kondh say their way of life is threatened by the planned mine Amnesty also called on the Indian authorities to seek the consent of local people before allowing Vedanta to begin mining bauxite in the nearby Niyamgiri Hills .
It fears the proposed mine could destroy the area 's ecosystem and threaten the entire way of life of the 8,000 - strong indigenous Dongria Kondh community , who have lived in the hills for centuries and depend on them for their crops and water .
" The Dongria Kondh do not cut trees or cultivate the top of the hill as they believe that their deity Niyam Raja Penu lives there .
Now they face the prospect of a 700 - hectare open - cast mine in their holiest place , " Amnesty said .
Vedanta did not respond immediately to Amnesty 's report when asked for comment by the BBC , but last year the firm argued that it had the support of the Orissa state government and the Indian judiciary - and that before it went ahead with the project it had consulted exhaustively to assess its environmental and social impact .

The Pope summoned the bishops for two days of meetings
Pope Benedict XVI has upbraided Irish Roman Catholic bishops over their handling of child sex abuse scandals .
He condemned abuse of children by priests as a " heinous crime " , and said Irish bishops must act to restore the Church 's " moral credibility " .
During two days of meetings at the Vatican , the Pope reprimanded the bishops for a " failure ... for years to act effectively " , a statement said .
Last year the Irish Church admitted covering up abuse for decades .
Two state - ordered reports revealed how abuse was rife in many Irish Catholic - run children 's institutions , and how priests who were accused of abuse were just moved by bishops to new parishes .
Investigators found that Church officials compiled confidential files on more than 100 parish priests accused of sexual abuse , but that the files were kept secret .
Victims of abuse have accused the Church of putting its own reputation ahead of concern for abused children .
' Honesty and courage '
Following three meetings with the bishops over two days , the Vatican released a statement saying : " All those present recognised that this grave crisis has led to a breakdown in trust in the Church 's leadership . "
ANALYSIS By David Willey
BBC Vatican correspondent
The proceedings were conducted in total secrecy , but we know from the official Vatican communique issued at the end of this extraordinary crisis meeting that the Pope strongly condemned the child abuse scandal .
The bishops promised the Pope that they were committed to co-operating with the civil authorities over the paedophilia scandal .
Pope Benedict lambasted the bishops for failing to act effectively over cases of sexual abuse of young people .
He wants " structural change " ' in the organisation of his Church in Ireland , which has an unusually high proportion of bishops in proportion to its population .
Vatican picks over Irish scandal The Pope had faulted " the failure of the Irish Church authorities for years to act effectively over cases of sexual abuse against young people " , the statement said .
" For his part , the Holy Father observed that the sexual abuse of children and young people is not only a heinous crime , but also a grave sin which offends God and wounds the dignity of the human person created in his image .
" While realising that the current painful situation will not be resolved quickly , he challenged the bishops to address the problems of the past with determination and resolve , and to face the present crisis with honesty and courage . "
The Vatican also said that the Irish bishops promised to co-operate with civil authorities , " to guarantee that the Church 's standards , policies and procedures represent best practice in this area " .
' Need action ' Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Victims of abuse by Irish priests have written a letter to the Pope calling for the resignation of bishops " who engaged in this culture of cover - up " .
" The lives of thousands of Irish people have been devastated by sexual abuse by priests , " the letter said .
Four bishops have already offered their resignations - though only one has been formally accepted .
A spokesman said the issue of resignation was not discussed at the Pope 's meetings with the bishops .
Victims of paedophile priests said the Pope 's words must be followed by action .
" We are entitled to expect that the Pope makes those who committed crimes or covered up crimes , including bishops , be made accountable , " said Irish Survivors of Child Abuse founder John Kelly .
" The words coming out at the moment seem to be positive .
Whether they will act upon them and whether they will go far enough is another matter .
We need to see the words turned into action , " he told the AFP news agency .

The National Organization of Restoring Men is a non-profit support group for men who have concerns about being circumcised , are considering foreskin restoration , or are in the process of restoring their foreskins .
Our aim is to help men regain a sense of self - directedness -- physically as well as emotionally .
NORM is dedicated to providing an arena in which circumcised men can share their concerns without fear of being ridiculed for a desire to be intact and whole again .
A safe place is provided to discuss goals and learn about methods and techniques of restoration and to discover those methods that will work best for each individual .
Now in its nineteenth year of operation , NORM continues to freely provide information and support to restoring men everywhere .
Men's Voices
When we men discuss our feelings about circumcision , no one listens , not even doctors .
I 'm one of the millions of men who does n't like being circumcised .
I wish I had been able to scream at the doctors , " Hands off , its mine ! "
- S.B. , 47 , Atlanta , GA I 've been restoring for almost two months and it's hard to believe , sex with my wife is getting better .
I actually have more feeling .
It 's great .
- 35 yr old man , CA I was cut at the age of 11 .
As the years have passed , I find that stimulation is difficult to achieve .
It seems as though an excess of manipulation , almost to the point of pain , is necessary to achieve satisfaction .
- V.T. , New Jersey
After thirty years in the natural state , I allowed myself to be circumcised because , in my physician 's view , there might be problems in the future .
For me , the sensitivity in the glans has been reduced at least 50 % .
- T.B. I 'm a 17 - year - old male who is circumcised .
I got to thinking , what am I missing ?
It makes me sad because I 'm not whole as I was intended to be .
Circumcision has deprived me of the most sensual receptor on my sexual organ .
- B.J. , Oregon I 'll always be my parents ' son , but my body belongs to me and no one else .
No one had my permission to circumcise me .
Since there was absolutely no medical threat from my foreskin , it is a clear violation of my basic human rights .
Could some doctors be giving wrong advice on infant circumcision because it is a big business in the U.S. ?

A new toy arrived today – the VisTablet , which is just a rebadged Aiptek 600U ( model number WCK - C121 ) .
They sell as Aiptek or Waltop or Medion or any one of a few other names for about € 65 on ebay .ie at the moment , so I thought what the heck , I do a fair bit of stuff in Gimp so maybe it ’s worth a look .
A few clicks and a week or so later and it arrives .
Cue tearing open the box and unwrapping !
Plugging it into the laptop ( Thinkpad R61 running Debian Squeeze amd 64 ) got an instant result in that it found the device and allowed cursor movement … but no actual buttons or pressure sensor stuff , so it could n’t work as a tablet .
So off to google we go and after trying some frustrating messing about with udev rules ( to create / dev / apitektablet – which is n’t necessary it turns out ) and hal fdi files ( to set up X.org options , which are needed ) and I ’d advanced in a posterior direction .
By now we were through the phase where plugging in the device crashed X and had reached the phase where plugging the device out crashed X .
At this point , I found that the problem lay in the wacom drivers .
See , just because it ’s aiptek hardware does n’t mean the aiptek drivers actually work – in this case , the wacom driver works much better .
But , just to be annoying , the new version of the wacom driver does n’t work because it picks up that it ’s not a wacom device and commits seppku to avoid being of any use .
Note to the coder who thought that was a good idea – go choke on a hairball please .

Go to linuxwacom and download the latest driver , then untar the tarball , go into linuxwacom - 0.8.4-2/src/xdrv and edit wcmUSB .c .
You ’re looking for this line ( it ’s line 530 in version 0.8.4.2 ) :
[ cc escaped =” true ” lang= ” c ” ] /* vendor is wacom */
if ( sID [ 1 ] == 0x056A )
{ [ / cc ]
And you want to change it to this :
[ cc escaped =” true ” lang= ” c ” ] /* vendor is wacom or waltop */
if ( sID [ 1 ] == 0x056A || sID [ 1 ] == 0x172f )
{ [ / cc ]
Now apt - get install xorg - dev and whatever other packages you need like build - essential and call configure and make and then sudo make install .
You now have a working wacom driver and if you copy the wacom .
fdi file into /etc/hal / fdi/policy / ( it ’s /usr/ share/hal/fdi/policy/20thirdparty/10-linuxwacom.fdi on Debian ) and add in the following bit :
[ cc escaped =” true ” lang= ” xml ” ] < match key = ” info.product ” contains = ” WALTOP ” >
< merge key = ” input.x11_driver ” type=” string ” > wacom </ merge >
< merge key =” input.x11_options .
Type ” type=” string ” > stylus </ merge >
< append key=” info.callouts.add ” type=” strlist ” > hal - setup - wacom </ append >
< append key =” wacom.types ” type=” strlist ” > eraser </ append >
< append key =” wacom.types ” type=” strlist ” > cursor </ append >
< append key =” wacom.types ” type=” strlist ” > pad</ append >
</ match >[/ cc ]
into the < device > section of the xml file ( you probably do n’t need the eraser and cursor lines , but what the heck , they do n’t harm anything and I was too tired of restarting X at this point to check ) .
You should now be almost done – restart hal , restart x.org , and log back in and then plug in the tablet ( check dmesg and / var / log / X.0.log so you ’re sure it worked ) and then fire up Gimp , go to Edit -> Preferences ->
Input Devices ->Configure Extended Input Devices and make sure the tablet is listed there and that it ’s not set to disabled , then go to Edit -> Preferences - >
Input Controllers and make sure that Linux Input is in the list of active controllers and is set to look at the tablet , and it should work .
Mind you … if this is what it takes to make cheap hardware work on linux , Linux Hater has a very good point .

Steal This Textbook
eBook “ piracy ” had become an increasing concern for the publishing industry in recent days .
Most bestsellers show up on the torrent sites pretty quickly .
The proprietary content publishers are entirely justified in being afraid .
We ’re going to kill them , and display their rotting corpses on our battlements .
On the P2P Research email list , Andy Robinson speculated on why this phenomenon had n’t yet expanded to include most academic books and articles .
Why do n’t the pdfs you buy from J - STOR wind up on torrent sites ?
Why do n’t people scan them in , for that matter ?
Andy speculates it ’s the relatively small potential readership , and the comparative ease for people in the academic community to obtain them via library J- STOR subscriptions or Interlibrary Loan .
Probably right .
What I wonder about , though , is college textbooks .
it seems to me that there ’d be a major demand for pirated versions given the absolutely monstrous copyright markups , and the deliberately crooked gimmicks used to circumvent competition in the used book market .
Textbook authors introduce the most minor modifications each year , and then assign their own books ( and their buddies ’ books ) as required reading .
The cost of scanning would be much lower , under these circumstances , given the possibility of a modular approach : just scanning the new material that publishers tweak old textbooks with each year .
And a single download site catering to college students would probably have very high traffic .
The main obstacle would probably be finding a secure host in a country where the DMCA is n’t enforced .
And once torrent files were uploaded , they ’d probably be widely duplicated and circulated by other student communities , including via darknets and “ sneakernet . ”
All the proprietary content industries floundering around with lame policies like pressuring ISPs to disconnect file - sharers is about as effective as a far in a high wind .
All they do is drive encryption and anonymization into the mainstream , so that the portion of the population that appears on the ISPs ’ radars shrinks like the dot on an old - fashioned picture tube .
If this happened I would absolutely rupture myself laughing at it .
The way things are now , I find the local University library constantly plastered over with RIAA “ Did You Know ? ” agitprop aimed at “ educating ” students about the dangers of “ stealing ” music .
But imagine if the campus were actually owned by the RIAA .
That ’s pretty much what the reaction will be when students are sharing pirated textbooks and depriving the faculty of their $ 150 cover price ?
The campus security crackdown in response would probably look like Romania in the last days of Ceaucescu–and with pretty much the same results .
So why are n’t there yet high - traffic torrent sites with “ pirated ” texts for freshman and sophomore courses , especially college requirements ?
Speaking ex cathedra from my armchair , as someone with absolutely no geek cred or tech skills whatever , I sure hope someone gets right on it .
Last year saw the smallest increase in rents in eight years , but property analysts warn they are set to rise again .
A report by Australian Property Monitors says nationally , rents grew by only 2 per cent in 2009 , making it the weakest year for national rental growth since 2002 .
That compares with an average 12 per cent in each of the previous two years .
But APM economist Matthew Bell says rental growth is likely to pick up again this year .
" In terms of the relatively flat rental market , it 's just been the weak economy , " he said .
" Renters have been a bit less sure about their job security so it 's just led to them not being able to agree to rental increases .
" But going forward there 's still very low vacancy rates , there 's still strong population growth and there 's simply not enough houses being built to house the rental demand that 's going to be there . "
He says things could get more difficult for alot of people .
" If we do n't start building enough houses to house the increased population and in general the increased income we 're going to get from an improved economy , then things will start getting tough for a lot of people , particularly those who have lost jobs or had to move to part time work , " he said .
" They 'll just be forced to move a bit further out and away from those areas of employment . "
The asking prices for rental properties in Sydney have risen by less than 2.5 per cent over the past 12 months .
In the last quarter , rents for houses remained unchanged , while tenants renting units paid an average of 1.2 per cent more .

The day after President Barack Obama urged members of Congress to be more transparent about their interactions with lobbyists , the House Republican Caucus headed up Interstate 95 for a retreat where they will be able to mingle privately with … lobbyists .
The annual retreat , sponsored by a non-profit group called the Congressional Institute , is meant to be a chance for members to escape the Beltway to talk about big ideas , hear from rising stars in the party , media pundits , and even visit with President Obama , who will address the caucus Friday .
In between these work sessions , though , there will be less formal gatherings involving several of the Institute 's 14 - member board of directors .
The vast majority of the Institute 's board is made up by top Capitol Hill lobbyists whose clients include leading drug manufacturers , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , and such major corporations as American Express and Verizon .
Institute Executive Director Mark Strand said the entire event has been scrubbed for potential ethics problems , and everything will be done above board .
He explained it this way :
" The institute 's supporters , who include lobbyists , do not plan , attend or participate in any session of the annual conference .
They are invited to a reception and dinner and depart the next morning , " he said .
" Such a courtesy for a tax - exempt organization 's supporters is commonplace and within ethical rules , " Strand added .
" All members of Congress who participate in the conference pay their own expenses .
The Institute does not employ a lobbyist nor does it engage in lobbying . "
Lobbyists
So far , though , the receptions involving the group 's lobbyists and sponsors have not been opened to the public .
Mary Vought , the press secretary for the House Republican Caucus , said in an email that the speeches by the president , and by Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell would be open to the press .
But not the reception and dinner .
Vought said she expects the event to provide a poignant setting for Republicans to work " on solutions to fix the failed Democrat policies enacted over the last 12 months . "

The Afghan immigrant at the center of what the authorities described as one of the most serious threats to the United States since 9/11 pleaded guilty Monday to terrorism charges in what he said was a Qaeda plot to detonate a bomb in the New York subway .
The man , Najibullah Zazi , admitted that he came to New York last year near the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks to kill himself and others on the subway using a homemade bomb .
He characterized the plot as a “ martyrdom operation ” that he was just days away from executing when he said he realized he was under government surveillance .
Mr. Zazi , 25 , pleaded guilty in United States District Court in Brooklyn to charges that included conspiracies to use weapons of mass destruction and to commit murder in a foreign country , and to provide material support for a terrorist organization .
He faces a possible life term when he is sentenced on June 25 .
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said at a news conference in Washington that the Zazi case represented one of the most serious threats to the United States since the 9/11 attacks .
El mundo de los videojuegos lleva décadas evolucionando y viviendo en una revolución constante de mejoras gráficas , de nuevas formas de contar historias , gracias a todo lo que ha supuesto la propia evolución de las máquinas , tanto ordenadores como consolas .
De ahí que la industria del videojuego se haya consolidado como el sector cultural más fuerte de nuestro tiempo , por encima incluso de la música y el cine .
Cada año , las grandes distribuidoras , las empresas punteras en el desarrollo de juegos y consolas , compiten por conseguir una parte mayor del pastel , a veces encontrando nuevos nichos o potenciando algunos que ya existen , para darles mayor importancia .
Uno de los últimos en ser aupado por la mayoría de empresas del sector es la realidad virtual .
Jugar con una pantalla es una experiencia indudablemente espectacular , pero meternos dentro del juego , sentirnos allí , rodeados por los paisajes y los sonidos que se escuchan , peleando físicamente contra los enemigos gracias a los mandos independientes …
Eso es una cosa muy diferente , y desde luego , una experiencia que lleva al jugador a meterse más de lleno si cabe en el juego .
Es cierto que suena mejor de lo que es , porque la tecnología todavía no está ni mucho menos desarrollada del todo , y los gráficos y la acción dentro de la Realidad Virtual no se pueden comparar a los que podemos disfrutar en los juegos habituales .
Sin embargo , la potencia de las nuevas consolas tal vez ayuden a darle el sitio que se merece a este nuevo nicho de mercado … si las grandes compañías apuestan por ello , claro está .

The new BMW Concept 5 Series ActiveHybrid
Munich :
The new concept car offers a particularly good rendition of the new BMW 5 Series Sedan in all its dynamic , efficient and innovative qualities , at the same time representing the ongoing development of the BMW ActiveHybrid X6 and the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 with their drivetrain technology already in production .
The drive system featured in the BMW Concept 5 Series ActiveHybrid consists of a straight - six gasoline engine with TwinPower Turbo technology , eight - speed automatic transmission , and electric drive .
Integration of BMW ActiveHybrid technology in a sedan already extremely efficient with its ' conventional ' combustion engine reduces both fuel consumption and emissions once again by more than 10 per cent .
At the same time the electric motor offers a boost function , supporting the gasoline engine in generating particularly dynamic drive power for an even more sporting driving experience in the car .
Intelligent energy management likewise serves to enhance the efficiency of the overall system , its unique functions ensuring appropriate control and management of all energy paths within the car and appropriate interaction of the drivetrain components precisely adjusted to driving conditions .
The drivetrain technology featured in the BMW Concept 5 Series ActiveHybrid allows all - electric , zero-emission motoring in city traffic .
At the same time a special hybrid - based Auto Start Stop function offers additional efficiency by consistently switching off the combustion engine when stopping at the traffic lights , a road junction , or in congested traffic .
Optimised comfort , finally , is provided by the auxiliary climate control function already featured in the BMW ActiveHybrid 7 .
The concept car based on the new BMW 5 Series Sedan for the first time presents the next generation of BMW ActiveHybrid technology , a special solution exclusive to BMW for intelligent interaction of the combustion engine and electric drive focused specifically on the requirements made of a dynamic sedan in the upper midrange segment .
Taking this approach , BMW is consistently continuing the development of hybrid technology according to a modular principle ( best of hybrid ) , thus offering the optimum rendition of BMW ActiveHybrid technology for each concept and vehicle segment .
In accordance with the BMW EfficientDynamics development strategy , this ensures highly effective and practical use of hybrid technology for the reduction of both fuel consumption and emissions .
The combustion engine is supported in the BMW Concept 5 Series ActiveHybrid by an electrical drive system developed specifically for this model and arranged in compact dimensions between the straight - six combustion engine and the automatic transmission .
( posted on conceptcarz.com )
Drawing its energy from a high - voltage battery at the back of the car , the electric motor develops maximum output of 40 kW .
An automatic clutch connects the gasoline engine and the electric motors .
Due to the particularly high level of torque generated from the start through the electric motors , the interaction of the two drive systems ensures extremely spontaneous and dynamic acceleration whenever required .
In overrun and when applying the brakes , the electric drive systems acts as a generator developing electric power fed into the high - voltage battery .
This converts kinetic energy otherwise wasted as heat in the brake system into electric power saved for subsequent use .
Such energy obtained without any further consumption of fuel may then be used to generate drive power or operate electrical functions in the car .
This principle is the same as that of Brake Energy Regeneration already applied in BMW 's current production models , with the level of electrical energy generated by the electric motor being significantly greater and the increase in efficiency correspondingly higher .
The high - voltage battery likewise developed for this specific concept is fitted within a high - strength special case near the rear axle of the BMW Concept 5 Series ActiveHybrid .
This leads to an optimum position in terms of both safety and harmonious weight distribution .
An integrated control unit permanently analyses the charge status of the high - voltage battery and controls both the battery charge process by way of Brake Energy Regeneration and the system cooling process .
Apart from the electric motor , the high - voltage battery also delivers electric power to the car 's on - board network .
Among other things , this allows efficient operation of the car 's auxiliary climate control activated whenever required by a remote control function to cool down the car 's interior significantly even before starting the engine .
Convenient use of the all - electric driving mode and the Auto Start Stop function is likewise guaranteed in this way , with all electrical functions such as the audio system , climate control or navigation remaining fully available even with the combustion engine switched off .
The BMW Group is one of the most successful manufacturers of automobiles and motorcycles in the world with its BMW , MINI and Rolls - Royce brands .
As a global company , the BMW Group operates 24 production facilities in 13 countries and has a global sales network in more than 140 countries .
The BMW Group achieved a global sales volume of approximately 1.29 million automobiles and over 87,000 motorcycles for the 2009 financial year .
Revenues for 2009 totalled euro 50.68 billion .
At 31 December 2009 , the company employed a global workforce of approximately 96,000 associates .
The success of the BMW Group has always been built on long - term thinking and responsible action .
The company has therefore established ecological and social sustainability throughout the value chain , comprehensive product responsibility and a clear commitment to conserving resources as an integral part of its strategy .
As a result of its efforts , the BMW Group has been ranked industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes for the last five years .
David Heineimeier Hansson , the creator of Ruby on Rails and partner at 37signals in Chicago , says that planning is guessing , and for a start - up , the focus must be on today and not on tomorrow .
He argues that constraints–fiscal , temporal , or otherwise–drive innovation and effective problem - solving .
The most important thing , Hansson believes , is to make a dent in the universe with your company .
An Ecosia search engine launching Monday is counting on the world 's fascination with the Internet to help save Brazilian rainforests and battle global warming .
An Ecosia search engine launching Monday is counting on the world 's fascination with the Internet to help save Brazilian rainforests and battle global warming .
A brain child of " green - minded friends " in Berlin , ecosia.org is powered by Bing and Yahoo !
search technology but gives at least 80 percent of its revenue to the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) to protect rainforests .
Ecosia has timed its official launch for Monday to coincide with the start of world climate talks in Copenhagen .
" Ecosia will definitely be the world 's greenest search engine , " WWF said in a statement .
" Each search with Ecosia will protect a piece of rainforest , so by making Ecosia your search engine , you can actually help the environment one search at a time . "
Ecosia is banking on the same online advertising tactics that have pumped a fortune into the coffers of Internet search king Google , with the funds benefiting nature instead of investors .
Advertisers typically pay search engines for each click on sponsored links appearing on results pages .
" Thanks to sponsored links , search engines earn billions every year , " said Ecosia founder Christian Kroll .
" Ecosia believes that there is a more eco- friendly way of using these huge profits and that the money should better be used to fight global warming . "
The WWF estimated that over the course of a year , a typical Internet user relying on Ecosia for search queries could protect a patch of rainforest about the size of an ice hockey rink , or 2,000 square meters ( 21,530 square feet ) .
A rainforest expanse the size of Switzerland could be saved annually with money generated by one percent of the world 's Internet users switching to Ecosia , according to the WWF .
More than half the world 's rainforests have been destroyed in the past 50 years and the amount of rainforest burned or cut down each year is greater than the size of England , according to Ecosia .
Deforestation generates climate changing carbon dioxide while eliminating precious wildlife habitat along with trees that produce life - sustaining oxygen .
Ecosia said it is following through on its green theme by relying on data centers that run on electricity from alternative sources that do not spew heat - trapping gases .
It will be taking on powerhouse Google , a search engine so popular that the California company 's name is used as a verb to refer to searching the Internet .
Unlike Google and other search engines , Ecosia promises to dump all records of users ' activities after 48 hours and not mine the data for marketing purposes .

The Freakonomics e-mail inbox constantly produces interesting material .
Like this one , from a reader we ’ll call G.D. :
I loved your books !
I have found my thoughts drifting to some of the subjects over the past few days , especially altruism and apathy .
I was curious if any of the experiments took into account the subjects ’ religious beliefs .
I do n’t know how one would logistically test that but it would be interesting to see how those claiming to follow a religious doctrine teaching altruism would do in the tests .
This thought led to another about myself .
How would I do in the tests ?
We are agnostics living deep in the heart of Texas and our family fakes Christianity for social reasons .
It ’s not so much for the sake of my husband or myself but for our young children .
We found by experience that if we were truthful about not being regular church attenders , the play dates suddenly ended .
Thus started the faking of the religious funk .
It seemed silly but it ’s all very serious business down here .
We do n’t go to church or teach or children one belief is “ right ” over another .
We expose them to every kind of belief and trust that they will one day settle in to their very own spirituality .
However , for the sake of friends and neighbors , we pretend we are Christians .
We try not to lie but rather not to disclose unnecessary information .
As the children are getting older , this is n’t so easy for them and an outing is probably eminent .
We are not the only ones .
We have found a few other fakers out there .
I would love it if you ever explored this subject in a future book .
I should mention that the friend who recommended Freakonomics to me is the head of the bible study at her church .

So , since you asked for it , here is our concise but clear point of view on these human powered contraptions .
Some readers have observed that we have n't paid any attention to one of the most low - tech innovations ever - the humble bicycle .
We noted the sex - appeal of pedal power ( and this concerns both men and women ) , but that 's about it .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do n't need any new infrastructure , what we need is to clear the existing infrastructure of inefficient vehicles and replace them with efficient ones
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hope that bikes - unlike oven stoves , moonlight towers or trolleybuses - do n't require an introduction .
But , to be sure , for those of you who have been moving exclusively from office garage to home garage via automobile and nothing else for most of your life : a bicycle is a two - wheeled , pedal - powered vehicle that was invented almost 150 years ago and can still be seen on the streets today .
If you slow down a bit in that car , you will be sure to spot one .
Initially , the bicycle was quite a dangerous contraption .
But , by the end of the 19th century , after the invention of the pneumatic tyre and the chain drive ( so that the velocity of the vehicle was no longer determined by the diametre of the front wheel ) it became a very popular means of transportation - a period that historians now label the " bicycle craze " .
Bikes were definitely the " it thing " back in the day , as these paragraphs from a 1896 New York Times article illustrate :
" Young men used to save up their money to buy a horse or a watch .
Now , they save to buy a bicycle , and there are thousands who are cutting off unnecessary expenses in the way of clothing , cigars , and amusements and luxuries , so as to possess a wheel . "
" So great was the crowd assembled in Madison Avenue at 7:30 last evening that the doors of the Madison Square Garden had to be thrown open in order to clear the street , and so the third annual bicycle show was opened a half hour before the hour originally decided upon . "
What bikes can do
One more thing that beginners should know is this : bicycles are not only suited to transport people , but also to carry goods .
There are many sturdy cargo bikes around these days , some of which are inspired by traditional models , and others not .
The amount of stuff you can move around by mere pedal power is surprising .
In short , with the modest bicycle it is possible to transport anything usually transported by cars or vans ( your suitcase , design furniture , a lover - sorry to focus on the sex appeal again but I am trying to catch your attention here ) .
What bikes need
Bicycles themselves are a mature technology with not that much to improve upon .
They do n't need rails , overhead lines , traffic management systems , smart grids , gas stations , batteries or superconductors - but they do need roads .
This is where the trouble begins .
It is interesting to note that the first smooth roads were built for bikes , and not for cars .
Alas , that was a time before the arrival of the automobile made an end to the bicycle craze .
Today , bicycle roads are inadequate or non-existent in most parts of the world .
As a result , riding a bike is dangerous at the very least and plain suicide at worst , in spite of the pneumatic tyres and chain drive .
The reason for this is simple : cars rule the roads .
It does not matter whether cars drive on gasoline , diesel , batteries , biofuels , hydrogen , hot air , dead rabbits or coffee husk : their sheer existence and number makes another bicycle craze almost impossible .
The good intentions
In order to solve this , there is more and more talk surrounding the implementation of bicycle highways .
The idea itself is not a new one : the comfortable ride offered by the elevated CycleWay in California more than 100 years ago is still unrivalled anywhere in the world today .
Some countries , most notably the Netherlands and Denmark , are making progress with fast , safe and separate roads for bikes , tagging them as " bicycle highways " .
Creative minds have designed elevated bicycle roads inspired by the long gone CycleWay ( but not nearly as sturdy if you ask me ) .
Even more creative minds have designed elevated covered bicycle highways that protect bikers from rain , wind and pigeon poop .
Some of these tunnels even have the potential to generate artificial tailwinds that would make you go twice as fast .
They will be heated in winter and cooled in summer .
The solution
While all these ideas are substantially better than many other inventions that are being designed these days ( carbon capture technology , algal fuel and nanotech batteries spring to mind ) this is not the way to go .
The problem is not that there is a lack of good roads - enough of these exist to bike from here to Mars and beyond .
The main problem is that these are occupied by automobiles that are not only dangerous but also very inefficient both in terms of energy use and floor space .
We do n't need any new infrastructure , what we need is to clear the existing infrastructure of inefficient vehicles and replace them with efficient ones .
In other words : give all streets , highways , cloverleaves and motorways exclusively to bicycles and all other human powered wheeled vehicles .
Get rid of cars .
Why make things so complicated if the solution is so simple ?
The arguments
Yes , I do want the motorway .
It takes me more than an hour to pedal from my town to the city , because half of the time I am waiting in front of a traffic light watching cars passing me by .
If I could ride up one of the many large highways or motorways that lead almost straight into the city , I would be there in less than 20 minutes .
If driving from A to B at a stretch was an exclusive privilege for cars for so long , then why can it not be an exclusive right for a much more efficient mode of transport ?
The views are n't bad either .
The transportation problem will never be solved unless we eradicate cars completely .
As we do n't have the courage to do that , all else we try will be in vain .
Streets have a limited capacity and there are few places where you can give all transport modes - pedestrians , bikers , cars , public transport - all that they need .
In order to find a solution , we need to eliminate the most inefficient vehicle type .
This is definitely the automobile - their hunger for space ends up being an even larger ( but underestimated ) problem than their hunger for fuel .
The new roads
Picture this for a second .
If cars are gone , we are left with pedestrians ( on the sidewalk ) , pedal powered vehicles ( one part of the streets and the highways ) and public transportation ( another part of the streets and the highways , separated from pedal powered traffic , or underground ) .
Taxis are allowed to stay , as long as they are equipped with pedals and chain drives .
We can maintain all possibilities that we have today : bikes for people who prefer their personal means of transportation ( freedom ! ) .
Public transportation for those who prefer not to pedal .
It should be noted that installing thousands and thousands of showers is definitely a more cost - effective option than unfolding a charging infrastructure for electric cars .
Maybe it is time for a revival of public baths ?
For long distance passenger transport , we have trains .
For long distance cargo transport , trains again .
Short distance cargo transport could see the revival of cargo trams ( streetcars ) .
Electric vehicles could be a part of the solution , too , both for cargo transport and for the disabled , provided they keep the same speed as bicycle traffic .
Roads would still be available for motorised ambulances , firetrucks and - some - police cars , they have sirens for that .
The result ?
A healthy population , smooth traffic , clean air , silent and safe roads , and oil independence .
The beauty ?
No money or new technology required .

The general who led the 1976 coup d'etat in Argentina is to be put on trial for crimes against humanity .
General Jorge Videla 's government is said to be responsible for kidnapping and murdering 30,000 people .
He was tried and pardoned in the 1980s , but courts in Argentina ruled six years ago that crimes against humanity were not included in the pardon .
So General Videla will now go on trial for more than 500 cases of kidnapping , 30 murders and almost 300 cases of torture .
Under the past two administrations , Argentina has begun prosecuting various high - ranking officials from the dictatorship - which lasted until 1983 - and there are nearly 400 cases pending .
General Videla , however , is considered the most important of the various generals and admirals who ran Argentina during that time .

Last speaker of ancient language of Bo dies in India :
Professor Anvita Abbi said that the death of Boa Sr was highly significant because one of the world 's oldest languages - Bo - had come to an end .
...
" It is generally believed that all Andamanese languages might be the last representatives of those languages which go back to pre-Neolithic times , " Professor Abbi said .

Thousands of Irish fathers are finding they have no option but to take the legal route , writes BRIAN O'CONNELL
PATRICK * IS a father of one , recently separated from his wife and currently going through the courts to gain increased access to his child .
Every day for the past few months he has had to consult his solicitor .
There are legal decisions to be made , letters to draft , court dates to try to tie down , psychiatrists to engage , allegations to respond to , and proposed schedules to draw up and negotiate .
All the time , an expanding file of acrimony between him and his wife is evolving .
It ’s a file that may take years to reverse and pacify .
As matters stand , he has no access schedule for school or annual holidays , and no weekday arrangements .
While maintenance arrangements were put in place with relative ease , his suggestions of an extra Saturday or Sunday afternoon , or earlier pick up on weekends , have not met with approval .
Like thousands of Irish fathers , he finds himself with no other option but to take a legal route to secure and build upon access arrangements .
Prior to the separation with his wife , Patrick said he had heard anecdotes about the difficulties some men faced through the Irish family law system .
Nothing though prepared him for the subsequent real life experience .
“ While I want to minimise the legal adversarial aspect , it is more or less unavoidable .
In our case , it ’s about access to my child .
I feel that access is being rationed out or doled out by my wife , ” he says .
“ It ’s difficult to see the child frequently .
The net result is that you have a child who wants to be with his dad and a dad who wants to be with his child , and it ’s an uphill battle all the way . ”
Many fathers such as Patrick say the law in Ireland has its roots in a different time , when the definitions of family were far more rigid .
“ The Constitution was drafted in 1937 when male and female roles were very different to what they are now .
The child ’s voice is lost in it .
I ’m sure in my case if the child ’s voice could be heard , he would want to see more of his dad , ” he says .
The Law Reform Commission is committed to examining certain aspects of the Irish family law system , and is expected to consider a range of measures including : allowing fathers day - to - day care and contact with their children ; the introduction of automatic guardianship and greater rights also for grandparents , thereby bringing Ireland in line with most of Europe .
Rachel O’Toole , a Cork - based solicitor who practises family law , believes there has already been significant improvement in the past decade in the area of family law and fathers ’ rights .
The current recession though has had an impact on issues of access and maintenance .
“ Anecdotally , we ’re hearing that a very common application is a reduction of maintenance , generally from father to mother , ” says O’Toole .
“ Access is quite a pressing issue also .
I think there is still a sense that access is within the gift of the mother .
What really needs to happen is for the focus to shift from parents to the child .
It is the child ’s right of access to the father in fact that we need to focus on . ”
O’Toole says that decisions in relation to both maintenance and access can vary hugely from judge to judge .
Overall though , she feels that fathers are getting more access and fairer hearings in recent years .
“ Over the last number of years , my experience is that there has been a shift towards increased access for fathers .
There is still ferocious work that needs to be done in respect of children ’s rights , ” she says .
“ There is more of a tendency towards overnight access for example .
Every case is different , but a common arrangement is every second weekend and mid-week access , along with quite generous holiday access .
I see that more often than I did 10 years ago . ”
Ray Kelly , an advocate for fathers ’ rights and founder of Unmarried and Separated Fathers of Ireland ( USFI ) , agrees that fathers are getting more time with their children in comparison to a decade ago .
“ The average access 10 years ago was about six hours a week .
Today , it ’s working out about 24 hours a week and the majority of guys are getting overnights .
I am happy to be able to say that , ” he says .
But while the family law system may be changing , and individual judges are more accommodating , perhaps the slowness in bringing Ireland ’s laws in line with other European countries is due to a lack of public outrage from separated or unmarried fathers .
“ I protest publicly about the bias in the family law system four times a year and between 50 and 70 people attend .
I would deal with that number of fathers on a weekly basis looking for advice and support .
I think that men find it hard to come to our support groups and find it hard to pick up the phone and look for help . ”
Why is it so hard for Irish fathers to make their feelings known ?
“ I think that dads whose main focus is to fight to see more of their children are afraid to put their heads above the parapet in case it affects their standing , ” says Patrick .
“ I think it is probably in the nature of Irish men from the age of 30 up not to bring personal issues like that into the public domain .
There is a sense of wanting to sort it privately rather than take to the streets over it .
That ’s the Irish way . ”

Some Afghans , though , warn that the tribal system is not a panacea and fear that the United States is adopting a quick - fix approach that will not create long - term stability .
They see the tribes as inherently anachronistic , sexist and corrupt — a system that further undermines the already extraordinarily difficult task of creating multiethnic , merit - based national institutions .
They warn that the country would be thrown into the hands of myriad tribal militias that the central government could never control .
Last week , the importance of the tribes to American strategy became clear when the leaders of the Shinwari tribe in eastern Afghanistan agreed to work with the government and forbid cooperation with the Taliban .
The pact was announced as a major first step for the American effort to win over the tribes .
It was not the first time outsiders have turned to Afghanistan ’s tribes as allies and surrogates .
The British , who fought Russia for control of the region in the 19th century , brought with them a practice of enlisting local leaders .
After the British departed , Afghan kings in Kabul relied on the tribal structure to maintain stability and order in remote areas .
But then came Communism in the mid-1970s , which viewed tribes as archaic obstacles to social progress and , most important , as a potential threat to party leaders ’ hold on power .
Hundreds of tribal elders were taken from their homes and killed in a series of brutal crackdowns .
At the same time , the United States , backed by the Saudi and Pakistani governments , unleashed its own assault on Afghanistan ’s tribes .
American - backed Wahhabi fundamentalism created hundreds of thousands of young mujahadeen “ holy warriors ” to attack Soviet troops in Afghanistan .
Religiously indoctrinated and flush with American cash , these young Afghan fighters viewed Muslim clerics and mujahadeen commanders — not tribal elders — as their true leaders .
Lawyers have presented their final arguments in the trial of Alan Ellis .
The prosecution slammed the ex-OiNK admin , saying that the site was set up with dishonest and profiteering intentions right from the start .
The defense tore into IFPI and countered by calling Ellis an innovator with talents to be nurtured .
Today the jury returned a unanimous verdict of not guilty , and Ellis walked free .
After a very long wait of more than two years , last week the OiNK trial got underway with the prosecution making their case against Alan Ellis .
This week it was the turn of the defense and yesterday both sides had the opportunity to summarize their positions by submitting their closing arguments to the jury at Teesside Crown Court .
Peter Makepeace , prosecuting , naturally painted an extremely negative picture , labeling the Pink Palace as a place designed from the ground up as a personal money - making machine for Ellis .
“ 21 million downloads .
600,000 - plus albums .
£ 300,000 .
This was a cash cow , it was perfectly designed to profit him and it was as dishonest as the day is long , ” said Makepeace .
It is common sense to come to the conclusion that Oink was dishonest , claimed the prosecution lawyer , adding that Ellis knows that it ’s dishonest “ to promote , encourage and facilitate criminal activity , ” and accusing him of telling the jury “ persistent , cunning , calculated lies . ”
It would , of course , be dishonest to promote “ criminal activity ” , but Mr Makepeace should be very well aware that the activity engaged in by OiNK ’s users is covered under civil law .
Switching momentarily from criticism to praise and then back again , Makepeace said that the OiNK website was a “ wonderful machine ” for sharing music but noted that while the site had a really good brand name , it was a brand synonymous with “ ripping off music . ”
University of London professor Birgitte Andersenok gave evidence earlier in the trial , stating that file - sharing did n’t hurt the music industry and led to more sales .
Mr Makepeace trashed her evidence .
“ It ’s nonsense , it ’s flannel , it ’s verbiage , it ’s garbage , ” he told the Court .
For the defense , Alex Stein said that Ellis had never knowingly acted dishonestly and that in 2004 when OiNK was launched , it was a “ brave new world ” on the Internet .
“ In many societies he’d be an innovator , a creator , a Richard Branson .
His talent would be moulded , not crushed by some sort of media organization , ” he said .
The media organization being referred to by Stein was the IFPI , who he said had never requested that OiNK be shut down , and had instead “ sat and watched . ”
Gazette Live reports that Stein went on to launch a scathing attack on the IFPI .
“ They used this site .
Their own members used this site to promote their own music and now they ’re crushing him .
Maybe he grew too big for them , maybe they ’ve taken a different marketing approach .
I do n’t know .
But it was decided that this site should be taken down .
“ All of us here are being manipulated to some sort of marketing strategy by the IFPI .
If anybody ’s acting dishonestly it ’s them , ” he said .
At the end of the two week trial the jury returned a unanimous verdict ( 12 to 0 ) .
Alan Ellis is not guilty of Conspiracy to Defraud the music industry .
He walked out of Teesside Crown Court a free man today , his name cleared .
The verdict cannot be appealed and Ellis can finally put the past behind him and move on .
Breaking story …
The Google AdWords blog announced they will be making a policy change to allow certain kinds of pharmaceutical ads to be shown on Google search results .
The policy change will go into affect towards the end of this month .
Here are some of the conditions :
(1) Only VIPPS and CIPA certified pharmacies will be allowed to advertise :
We ’ve made the decision to further restrict the ads we accept for online pharmacy sites in the U.S. and Canada .
Starting at the end of this month , Google AdWords will only accept ads from online pharmacies in the U.S. that are accredited by the National Association Boards of Pharmacy VIPPS program , and from online pharmacies in Canada that are accredited by the Canadian International Pharmacy Association ( CIPA . )
(2) Pharmacies can only target ads within their country :
These pharmacies may only target ads to users in the country in which they are accredited .
This policy change does not affect our online pharmacy policy for countries outside the U.S. and Canada .

Just a hair over nine years ago , the Cassini spacecraft caromed past Jupiter , stealing a tiny bit of the giant planet 's energy to hasten the space probe 's journey to Saturn .
When it passed Jupiter at a distance of about 10 million kilometers ( 6 million miles ) , Cassini saw this :
[ Click to enjovianate .
Seriously , the full - res picture is jaw - dropping . ]
This stunning shot is actually a mosaic of 27 images : 9 images to cover the planet in a 3x3 grid , and 3 images at each location to get red , green , and blue exposures to make this near true - color image .
While the Voyagers ( which also flew past Jupiter ) and Galileo ( which orbited the planet for about 8 years ) took higher - resolution images , this is the sharpest color global view of Jupiter taken .
It 's one of my favorite shots of Jupiter , too , edged out by the crescent view of the planet from Cassini ( with the added bonus of a crescent Io ) as it left on its way to Saturn .
You can see that image and more on the Cassini Jupiter Encounter page .
The probe has been in orbit around the ringed planet for a long time now , but when you peruse those gorgeous images , do n't forget that in space , you can almost always get more than just one bird with one stone .

One of the recent themes here has been the topic of iPhone OS web apps — apps for the iPhone and iPod Touch that are built with nothing more than HTML , CSS , and JavaScript .
And specifically , the issues of how good an experience iPhone web apps can offer , and how easy they are to develop , compared to native Cocoa Touch apps .
One area in particular where iPhone web apps fall short of native iPhone apps is scrolling .
Take for example a long list , such as your full address book in Contacts , or all your songs in the iPod app .
When you scroll these lists , you can fling the list , and the list will scroll at high speed after you let go .
The effect is sort of like spinning a wheel with very little friction .
With iPhone web apps , you can make a list that looks almost , maybe even exactly , like a native iPhone list view .
But all web views on the iPhone scroll with almost no momentum .
You ca n’t fling them .
iPhone web views feel like they have a lot of scrolling friction .
This friction might make sense for regular web pages rendered on the iPhone ’s small screen , where by “ regular ” I mean “ not optimized specifically for display on the iPhone ” .
But it just feels slow — stuck — on iPhone - optimized apps .
If you ’ve never taken notice of it , try it now , comparing something like your Contacts app list with an iPhone web app like Showtime .
( In Showtime , tap “ Watchlist ” and then tap the “ + ” button to get a nice long list to scroll through . )
Another good scrolling comparison : native iPhone Twitter clients like Tweetie and Birdfeed versus iPhone web app Twitter clients like Hahlo and the new Mobile Twitter .
The difference is significant , and far more than cosmetic .
As Justin Williams recently wrote :
I believe that with the current crop of Web technologies available in MobileSafari , apps like Hahlo , PocketTweets and Showtime could thrive as an alternative to their native counterparts if Apple allowed developers to adjust the scrolling / drag coefficient of Mobile WebKit .
If you compare the scrolling speed of your Twitter timeline in Hahlo and Tweetie , the results are drastically different .
Tweetie feels like it effortlessly scrolls based on how much momentum you exert in the scroll action , while Hahlo is being constrained by a fifty pound weight on its back .
Scrolling is n’t the only UI / experience issue where web apps seemingly can’t quite match what native iPhone apps can offer .
Another is that MobileSafari does n’t allow for CSS fixed - position elements , which means you ca n’t make a toolbar that stays put at the very top or bottom of the screen without having it scroll away when you scroll the content .
And that ’s just talking about the user experience side of things .
The other side is that of development .
Last month I wrote :
When you write a Cocoa Touch app for the iPhone , you ’re not starting from scratch .
You ’re starting with the Cocoa Touch framework .
As Faruk Ateş astutely points out in his response to Koch , to discount the framework is to discount everything that sets the iPhone apart as a development platform .
Not only are native iPhone apps faster and more capable than their web - app equivalents , but they ’re easier to write .
Some readers objected to this , arguing , more or less , that no matter how good the Cocoa Touch framework is , native iPhone apps are harder to develop than web apps because one must learn both the app framework ( Cocoa ) and a new programming language , Objective - C .
But that ’s not really a fair comparison .
It ’s like saying it ’s easier to run than to bike if you do n’t know how to ride a bicycle .
Let ’s clarify .
Let ’s specify that we ’re talking about creating iPhone apps with great design and user experiences .
Let ’s acknowledge that to make anything great — anything at all , software or otherwise — one needs talent , experience , and familiarity and expertise with the necessary tools .
If you ’re already an expert web developer but have never programmed Cocoa software , then yes , there ’s large time - consuming Step Zero in front of you before you can attempt to develop a native iPhone Cocoa Touch app .
But , likewise , there are long - time Cocoa Mac ( and a handful of even longer - time NeXT ) developers who have no idea how to create a modern AJAX-y web app from HTML , CSS , and JavaScript — and who think JavaScript is the weird programming language .
What I ’m saying is that talented Cocoa Touch developers have an easier job implementing the same iPhone app than talented web app developers do .
The Cocoa Touch framework makes all sort of things free or easy .
Things like smooth fast animation between views .
Things like buttons and lists and toolbars that look just like other standard iPhone buttons , lists , and toolbars .
There do exist some open source frameworks for iPhone web app developers , so that one need not start from scratch implementing things to mimic Cocoa Touch UI elements .
iUI , started by Joe Hewitt just a few weeks after the original iPhone debuted in July 2007 , is one .
jQTouch , by David Kaneda and based on jQuery , is another .
( Showtime is built using jQTouch . )
But these frameworks do n’t solve the problem with scrolling speed / friction , or fixed - position elements .
It ends up there is a company , however , that has developed an amazing iPhone web app framework which :
Completely hides the address bar , even when running not from a saved - to - the - home app icon , but within a page in MobileSafari itself .
Allows for fixed - position toolbars that never budge from the top when you scroll .
And : sets its own scrolling friction coefficient , allowing you to fling long lists .
The company behind this web framework is Apple .
And the framework is apparently named Pastry Kit .
The Best iPhone Web App in the World
If you have an iPhone or iPod Touch handy , stop reading this and go here :
http://help.apple.com/iphone/3/mobile/
This is not a secret web site .
In fact , it may well already be in your iPhone bookmarks — it ’s where you get redirected when you choose the “ iPhone User Guide ” bookmark that ’s included as one of the defaults for MobileSafari .
I do n’t know when Apple launched this Pastry Kit - powered version of the site , but it ’s been under our noses for a while , with very little notice .
1
If you do n’t have an iPhone or iPod Touch handy , or if you do and you ’re back after trying it out and want to poke at it with Safari ’s Web Inspector , you can also load it in Mac or Windows Safari by setting the user agent string to MobileSafari 3.x in Safari ’s Develop menu .
( Without the MobileSafari user agent string , you ’ll get redirected to a different iPhone help page ; using a MobileSafari 2.x user agent string , you ’ll see last year ’s version of the User Guide , which is far less impressive technically . )
Shrink your Safari window down to roughly iPhone dimensions before loading the site , because the UI will be laid out to fill the dimensions of the viewport when it loads .
The JavaScript source code has been minimized / optimized , but it ’s not obfuscated , per se , so it ’s easy to see that the framework is called PastryKit , and even a dilettante JavaScript hacker like me can follow along and see some of what ’s going on .
Pastry Kit accomplishes all three of the aforementioned things — hiding the MobileSafari address bar , providing fixed - position toolbars , and providing scrolling with momentum — by disabling regular scrolling and setting up its own view hierarchy and implementing its own scrolling .
From WebKit ’s perspective , everything in this iPhone User Guide is in a view that is exactly the size of the viewport , so there ’s nothing to scroll .
Pastry Kit handles all of what the user sees as scrollable content .
This is how on the iPhone it provides for lower - friction scrolling than provided by MobileWebKit itself — Pastry Kit does its own scrolling math .
And it ’s even more noticeable when running the app in desktop Safari with the user agent trick , because you never see Mac scrollbars , and ca n’t use your mouse scrollwheel to scroll the content .
Everything related to scrolling is implemented within the app itself , in JavaScript .
After installing the User Guide app to your home screen and launching it from there , there ’s really very little to suggest that it is n’t a native iPhone application .
No MobileSafari address bar at the top , no MobileSafari toolbar at the bottom .
Scrolling is fast and has momentum .
It even works perfectly offline , because the contents of the user guide are stored locally in a database using HTML5 .
It ’s not perfect .
Scrolling is smooth on my iPhone 3GS , but it ’s a little janky on my old iPhone 3G and original iPhone .
( Still better than the scrolling in any other web app I ’ve ever seen , though — just not native - app - smooth . )
Taps and gestures sometimes do n’t register — this is most noticeable for me when I try to scroll as fast as I can with a quick finger swipe .
Super - quick gestures , I suspect , sometimes slip through the JavaScript event filters .
The rubber - band “ bounce ” scrolling — where if the view is already at the top but you pull down in an attempt to scroll up and you see whitespace and it all just bounces back into place when you let go — breaks if you pull down all the way off the bottom of the display .
What happens there is the view gets “ stuck ” in the position where it ’s displaying the stretched - out whitespace at the top of the view ; you can unstick it by just tapping somewhere in the content area .
And , lastly , it does n’t work at all with the iPhone ’s system - standard gesture where you can tap the status bar at the top of the screen ( the bar that displays the carrier name , signal strength , time , and battery life ) to scroll to the top .
In MobileSafari , if you tap the status bar while running this app , the entire MobileSafari view scrolls to the top , which exposes the browser address bar .
When running the User Guide app from the home screen , tapping the status bar simply has no effect .
I presume the problem here is that there is no JavaScript event in mobile WebKit for status bar taps — the event goes to the iPhone app , and the web app running in WebKit inside the iPhone app ca n’t see it or register a handler to act upon it .
From a user ’s perspective , an iPhone web app launched from the home screen is just another app .
But technically , it ’s like a meta app — it ’s a JavaScript app running inside a native iPhone app that just presents a full - screen WebKit view and loads the web app .
But on the whole this User Guide app and the Pastry Kit framework are rather amazing .
The $ 64,000 question , though , is whether PastryKit is something Apple intends ( or that a team within Apple hopes ) to ship publicly .
It seems like a lot of effort to build a framework this rich just for this iPhone User Guide , so I ’m hopeful the answer is yes .
Perhaps something integrated with the next major release of Dashcode ?
And , perhaps with integrated UI layout tools , along the lines of Interface Builder ?
Here ’s to hoping we have n’t heard the last of PastryKit , and that Apple continues work on making mobile WebKit an open alternative to the App Store .
PastryKit / iPhone User Guide Demos
For the sake of posterity and for those of you without access to an iPhone or Safari , I ’ve made two screencasts showing the iPhone User Guide web app in action .
This article first was first published in Alternet .
While Tea Party movement followers ran around Nashville last week dressed up in their Paul Revere period costumes , blathering about their heroic struggle against Obama ’s Islamosocialist tyranny , the right - wing elite that nurtures them , and their paid libertarian ideologues , have been openly advocating the abolition of America ’s democracy in favor of a free - market junta , because , as they say over and over , voters can not be trusted to rule themselves .
Here , for example , is how one popular libertarian pundit summed up the attitude : “ To be a libertarian in a modern democracy is to say that nearly 300 million Americans are wrong , and a handful of nay - sayers are right . ”
It ’s a quote so common among the Republican and libertarian vanguard that it ’s almost irrelevant which one of them said it — I ’ll get to this guy later , but suffice to know that he ’s a tenured professor , and sitting pretty in the same billionaire - funded world of think tanks , institutes , and PR machines that launched the Tea Party .
That ’s the dangerously authoritarian part of the Tea Party that we ’ve forgotten about lately .
It ’s evident even in Republican Rep.
Tom Tancredo ’s shocking “ Jim Crow speech ” that kicked off last week ’s Tea Party Convention — when the out - of - the - closet xenophobe unveiled his Big Idea on how to preserve America ’s freedom , he was n’t just advocating more bigotry , but also a plan to roll back America ’s overly - free democracy , replacing it with a rule of elites that uses “ civics literary tests ” as the justification for denying voting rights to tens of millions of “ wrong ” Americans , like minorities and people with funny accents .
Tea Party activist demonstrating what “ freedom ” would look like under a pure free - market system .
That ’s what made the whole period - costume fetish party so surreal : the sight of all these people re-enacting the Founding Fathers revolutionary fight for democracy , while at the same time cheering on a plan that overthrows American democracy and restricts power to a vanguard elite — which presumably includes the kinds of draft - dodging rednecks and bipolar government - parasites like Tancredo .
* Most of the gullible rank - and - file fools at the convention who snickered gleefully at Tancredo ’s “ I have a dream … of denying democratic rights to poor black kids ’s families and brown kids ’ families … ” speech did n’t understand that in all likelihood , they too would have their “ irrational ” voting rights canceled , because their masters despise them .
And they do n’t even hide it .
As incredible as it seems , these Republican and “ libertarian ” ideologues have been arguing that the real problem in America ’s democracy is that too many people have voting rights , leaving America at the mercy of “ irrational ” or dangerous voters who elect the wrong people .
They have argued that the only way to save America is by overthrowing this democracy and replacing it with an enlightened , free - market dictatorship .
One reason you do n’t hear much about this is because most of them zipped up their mouths by the middle of 2008 , when there was a real fear of a populist uprising and a new New Deal .
But the Republican right - wing elite was n’t always so shy ; right up through the financial collapse , many boasted as publicly as possible about their dream of overthrowing the democracy and replacing it with a free - market dictatorship .
Take one recent example : Republican ideologue Kevin Hassett , a top economic adviser to Bush and McCain and who heads the right - wing American Enterprise Institute ’s economic policy department where so many brilliant free - market ideas are incubated .
In 2007 , Hassett boldly questioned whether democracy is really the best way to preserve America ’s free - market preeminence , in a Bloomberg column headlined , “ Does Economic Success Require Democracy ? “ :
“ Dictatorships are not hamstrung by the preferences of voters for , say , a pervasive welfare state .
… The unfree nations will grow so quickly that they will overwhelm free nations with their economic might .
…
Meanwhile , democracies may copy many of the market - friendly policies of the dictatorships , but it seems unlikely that free citizens will choose to reduce their own political freedoms . ”
This is a constant meme among libertarian free - market ideologues : Americans have too much freedom to decide their own freedom .
Hassett worries that time is running out for the Republican free - market elites , who are locked in a suicide pact with the boneheaded majority of American voters , a mass of idiots too short - sighted to grasp how unregulated capitalism is the best thing for them .
Instead of acting in their own interests and voluntarily voting to hand power over to a Chinese - style Politburo , we idiots keep on grunting for socialist policies like Medicare , Social Security , and unemployment insurance when we ’re too weak to face unemployment on our own .
You ’d think Hassett would have been driven into a cave after that column , but then again , this is the same guy who co-wrote one of the biggest embarrassments in finance literature :
Dow 36,000 , a book released 10 years ago predicting the Dow would soar to 36,000 in no time .
We ’re dealing with a professional huckster here , but that ’s sort of the point–selling the gullible fools one kind of snake oil in 2000 , pitching them another kind of libertarian snake oil today .
From the Republican elite ’s perspective , abolishing democracy is a matter of self - defense for the rightwing billionaire class , which they expect everyone to sacrifice their lives for .
Bill Archer , an old free - market colleague of Tancredo ’s , let loose the Republican elite ’s loathing for democracy in a Wall Street Journal article back in 2001 , bleating over the fate of his billionaire sponsors :
“ Politicians may find it easier and easier to raise tax rates that apply only to a minority of middle - and upper - income earners in order to finance new government spending primarily benefiting lower - income individuals .
The result will be class warfare at its worst and a sort of tyranny of the majority . ”
You got that ?
Freedom is when an elite minority pushes the tax burden down the class ladder ; tyranny is when the struggling majority votes to put a cramp in the super - rich ’s Marie Antoinette lifestyle .
Which is pretty much what another major inspiration in the Tea Party movement , Grover Norquist , once said .
A few years ago , the notorious tax - slashing Republican lobbyist who heads Americans For Tax Reform told aRepublican Log Cabin conference :
“ Democracies are dangerous .
Look what happens in California where they pick on the richest ten percent . ”
Yup , that ’s dangerous all right .
Norquist , who helped shape Gingrich ’s 1994 Republican Revolution and who practically owned Washington during Bush ’s first term , has always pitched himself as a radical libertarian whose goal is to “ shrink the government until it ’s small enough to drown in a bathtub . ”
Why does he want to shrink and murder government ?
Because government technically can be used by us — the majority — to one day threaten Grover ’s rightwing billionaire circle ’s monopoly on power and wealth .
Kill off the American government , and the American people are left naked and powerless against the super - rich elites .
Bryan Caplan , a George Mason professor , and one of the last up - and - coming libertarian ideologues before the 2008 crash , is one of the newest and most degenerate models in the libertarian cadet system .
A graduate of the familiar Milton Friedman School of Hucksternomics , Caplan laid out this increasingly shrill hatred of American democracy back in 2007 in a book titled The Myth of the Rational Voter .
Here ’s how Caplan described his book :
The central idea is that voters are worse than ignorant ; they are , in a word , irrational — and they vote accordingly .
Despite their lack of knowledge , voters are not humble agnostics ; instead , they confidently embrace a long list of misconceptions .
Economic policy is the primary activity of the modern state .
And if there is one thing that the public deeply misunderstands , it is economics . …
So what remedies for voter irrationality would I propose ?
Above all , relying less on democracy and more on private choice and free markets …
Another way to deal with voter irrationality is institutional reform .
Imagine , for example , if the Council of Economic Advisers , in the spirit of the Supreme Court , had the power to invalidate legislation as “ uneconomical . ”
Similarly , since the data show that well - educated voters hold more sensible policy views , we could emulate pre-1949 Great Britain by giving college graduates an extra vote .
But Professor Caplan also tsk-tsks his billionaire sponsors for their misguided soft - heartedness in their dealings with the rest of us : “ As long as elites persist in unmerited deference to and flattery of the majority , containing the dangers of voter irrationality will be very hard .
Someone has to tell the emperor when he is naked .
He may not listen , but if no one speaks up , he will almost surely continue embarrassing himself and traumatizing spectators . ”
And just in case you ’re wondering if there ’s some nuance you ’ve missed , Caplan drops the high theoretical mumbo- jumbo and lays it in terms any lughead could understand , during a Q&A at the Cato Institute :
Turning to Caplan , [ the moderator ] asked , “ Bryan , is low turnout even a bad thing ? ” “ No , ” he replied to some laughter .
“ Low voter turnout is actually a blessing in disguise .
One of the two key things that predicts turnout is actually higher education , and more educated people generally have more sensible views about policy . ”
As to whether people should perhaps just be more properly informed , Caplan said , “ If you can either encourage people who do n’t know what they ’re doing to not vote or at least not encourage them to vote , or you could have massive public education to raise the level of awareness in everyone up to the level of a Ph.D. — if there are even such resources in the universe —
I think it ’s better to just encourage people to be lazy .
Say , ‘ You know , if you do n’t really know what ’s going on , it would actually be the more responsible thing not to participate . ' ”
That latter option , he said , is “ much cheaper . ”
And here ’s what ’s frightening :
His ideas are celebrated as sheer genius by establishment outlets .
Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times praised Caplan ’s book in 2007 , calling his blueprint for a Pinochet - like dictatorship , “ the best political book of the year ” ; while the Harvard Political Review wrote , “ While one may quibble with his specifics , the overall argument is convincing and applicable across a variety of fields …
Forces the reader to take a second look at our nation ’s unshakable faith in the wisdom of the electorate . ”
Bryan Caplan : Portrait of a Waffentwerp
Caplan is the one whom I quoted at the beginning of the article , sneering at the 300 million Americans whom he ’d like to disenfranchise and would if his Republican billionaire sponsors decided to pull the trigger .
This is a guy who should be chased out of town and out of our hemisphere .
But instead Caplan ’s what passes for “ bold ” and “ thinking outside the box ” in our degenerate era .
And besides , Caplan sits on the shoulders of giants when he talks that way — giant elitist assholes like Ronald Reagan , the hero of the Republican Party and a good part of the Tea Party movement .
In a 1965 speech , he revealed his and his party elite ’s loathing of American democracy , which he argued is the surest path to dictatorship and poverty :
“ A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government .
It can only exist until the voters discover they can vote themselves largesse out of the public treasury .
From that moment on the majority … always vote[s ] for the candidate promising the most benefits from the treasury with the result that democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal policy , always to be followed by dictatorship . ”
Reagan sees us , the electorate the same way that the humans hiding in their vulnerable fortress saw the zombies in Land of the Dead : it was only a matter of time before we ’d learn to use the democracy weapon , bust down the fence and pour into their hard - earned mansions , devouring and destroying everything with our socialist voting tendencies .
And the Gipper stood on the shoulders of other giants , like the crackpot midget Milton Friedman , whose free - market theories shaped the last three decades of our lives .
What few people talk about is Friedman ’s theory about democracy , and our fitness for it : in his mind , we majority of Americans are capable of rational behavior in the free marketplace ( because he thought we behaved according to his models ) , but we are irrational when we act in the political marketplace ( because we had n’t always voted the way he ’d like us to ) .
Or take Friedman ’s free - market rival , Friedrich von Hayek , the Kaiser of Libertarian Crackpots , who famously praised General Pinochet : “ Personally I prefer a liberal dictator to democratic government lacking liberalism . ”
The same Pinochet whom Friedman happily served in the 70s .
What about the $ 23 trillion Republican bailouts ?
Well , again , we ’re too stupid to understand .
The thing is , those bailouts had to be done their way in order to save us from the Road to Serfdom .
It ’s hard to explain , but basically , the anti-government conservatives in the Bush Machine saved us from that Road to Serfdom by turning us into serfs .
You see , all along it was the Road that they warned us about , not serfdom — that road is really treacherous , and government funded , and just a bad place to be .
We were n’t rational or strong enough to wean ourselves off of big government .
So they saved us with their tough love , and stole the $ 23 trillion bailout for themselves before we could get our hands on it — which no doubt we would have done .
In their hands , that $ 23 trillion debt makes us serfs , which is not as bad as the other alternative : we take the $ 23 trillion ourselves , leading us down the road to serfdom .
Confused ?
If we were capable of studying economics , we ’d understand the scientific logic of this reasoning .
Just as it took years for Milton Friedman ’s ideas to go from the circus freakshow to respected state religion , so this budding libertarian idea of abolishing democracy to save America , given the stakes and the forces behind it , should n’t be dismissed .
They ’re thinking about it .
So should the rest of us .

* Note : In 1969 , when Tancredo was finishing his four - year stint as pro-war College Republican campus activist , he received a note in the mail from the Draft Board calling him up for duty in Vietnam — so the wobbly - kneed invertebrate ran screaming and crying to the draft board appealing for an exemption from the very same war told everyone else to die in .
After making a total abject ass of himself squirting into his underwear before the draft board , they finally gave in and handed Tancredo the yellow - striped coward ’s exemption he begged for — ruling him mentally unfit for duty due to “ anxiety bouts ” and “ panic attacks . ”
It was the only government job he ever turned down — he believed that “ sacrifice ” meant sacrificing other people ’s money and lives , not his own .
After squirming out of the war , Tancredo spent the rest of his life sucking on the taxpayer teat , first as a junior high school teacher , then a state legislator , then a Department of Education federal employee ( where he spent most of his time firing his colleagues ) , then Congressman , and finally , a Republican Party foundation - welfare queen .

Another woman who has testified before the U.S. Congress that she was raped in Iraq while working for KBR and that the company did nothing about it has decided to sue .
Dawn Leamon of Illinois filed a lawsuit in Houston federal court on Wednesday against KBR , Halliburton , and a former KBR employee who she believes raped her while stationed as a paramedic at Camp Harper near Basra .
On the evening of February 3 , 2008 , Leamon claims , her co-workers gave her a spiked drink that made her begin to feel strange .
Her last memory of the night was of two men switching places as they sodomized and forced her to give them oral sex , the lawsuit states .
The next morning , " There were blood and feces on Ms. Leamon , and feces in her mouth as well , " according to the lawsuit .
Leamon alleges that a U.S. military investigator later told her that KBR 's camp manager walked in on the rape numerous times while it was taking place .
Leamon says that she was told not to talk about the alleged rape and did not because she feared for her safety .
It was only after she was transferred to another camp that she told KBR what had happened .
Leamon claims that instead of helping her and providing medical and psychological care , KBR " simply left [ her ] alone , unable to speak with anyone about the assault . "
Leamon told her story to Congress in April 2008 .
According to the federal court website PACER , the case is set for an initial pretrial conference on May 5 .
The family of late author Philip K . Dick is threatening to have its lawyers gouge Google 's eyes out over claims that the new Nexus One smartphone violates trademarks established in the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? , better known to the world at large as Blade Runner .
The name may not ring a bell with most mobile phone customers but Isa Dick Hackett , one of the author 's daughters and head of Electric Shepherd Productions , is nonetheless unhappy with it .
" We feel this is a clear infringement of our intellectual property rights , " she said earlier this week .
" Our legal team is dealing head - on with this . "
The problem , according to Ms. Dick , is that the Nexus One name is a clear reference to the Nexus - 6 replicants that featured in the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ?
that ultimately became the basis for the cult classic film Blade Runner .
Furthermore , the phone runs the Android operating system , which she says serves to reinforce the connection .
" [ Google uses the ] Android system , and now they are naming a phone Nexus One , " she added .
" It 's not lost on the people who are somewhat familiar with this novel . "
The case may be difficult to win , however .
Marc Reiner of legal firm Dorsey & Whitney LLP said that characters like Mickey Mouse are much more likely to be protected as a trademark because they 've previously been used in conjunction with other products .
The estate will also have to prove that people are likely to think the novel and phone are somehow connected , he added , asking , " Will people buying the Google phone hear the Nexus One name and think that is just like in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? "
When contacted for comment , a Google representative who wished to remain anonymous said , " Let me tell you about my mother . "

So here 's the thing :
I play videogames on Television , I lost 90 lbs then wrote a blog ( and then made a film ) about the experience called " How to Lose Weight in 4 Easy Steps " , and I got gray hair when I was 14 .
I 'm a weird nerd who wears stupid clothing , reads a lot of books , and sucks at talking to girls .
I like the cut of your jib .

Annular Solar Eclipse of 2010 January 15
On Friday , 2010 January 15 , an annular eclipse of the Sun is visible from within a 300 - km - wide track that traverses half of Earth .
The path of the Moon 's antumbral shadow begins in Africa and passes through Chad , Central African Republic , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Uganda , Kenya , and Somalia .
After leaving Africa , the path crosses the Indian Ocean where the maximum duration of annularity reaches 11 min 08 s.
The central path then continues into Asia through Bangladesh , India , Burma ( Myanmar ) , and China .
A partial eclipse is seen within the much broader path of the Moon 's penumbral shadow , which includes eastern Europe , most of Africa , Asia , and Indonesia .

Is Dias the leader Man City have craved since Kompany left ?
A leader and one of Europe 's most promising centre - backs - meet Ruben Dias , the man Man City hope can fill the void left by Vincent Kompany .
The multiplayer beta for StarCraft II is in full swing , and I 've been spending every bit of free time plugged into my Command Center .
It 's far too early to make any judgments about balance or get a reading on the eventual face of the revamped Battle .
net interface , but the beta tell us many things regardless .
Cynical types would have you believe that StarCraft II is little more than a unit overhaul and a graphical refresh of the original game .
While it 's true that many core mechanics carry directly over to this sequel , once you dig past the top layer , the gameplay has several substantial differences .
The interface remains largely similar , but a few tweaks make a lot of difference .
The twelve - unit selection cap is gone , making managing large forces less frustrating .
Multiple buildings can be selected ( and hot - keyed ) at once , allowing for easier production management .
Flying units have a small tracer displaying their relative position on the ground .
Simple abilities can be set to auto - cast , à la Warcraft III .
In sum , all the small changes bring StarCraft II up to modern RTS standards while retaining the small - scale micromanagement philosophy that defines the franchise .
The factions are even less symmetrical than they used to be , with their signature abilities further integrated into their play styles [ see following pages for faction - specific breakdowns ] .
More units , more abilities , more counters , and new map features diversify the gameplay from match to match .
It 'll take some time to familiarize yourself with the dozens of strategies that each faction can employ .
Add mixed - race teamwork , and the possibilities explode .
Also taking into consideration the Battle . net relaunch with its integrated social networking features and supposedly improved matchmaking , StarCraft II is n't doing anything to disappoint so far .
Nevermind the delays ; if the game improves as much for release as it has since the last time I saw it , the wait will be worth it and then some .
Terrans
As in the original , Terrans are the middle - of - the - road faction , falling somewhere between the numerous - but - weak Zerg and the expensive - but - strong Protoss .
The Terran early game is much different this time , though , thanks to the addition of new infantry types .
Marines are just as you remember them , but the cliff - ignoring , close - combat Raiders are an unbelievable harassment unit in the hands of an expert .
Many maps have starting bases on elevated plateaus , giving Raiders a quick entry / exit over terrain impassable to other units .
More than ever , you have to guard your workers against a Terran opponent .
Marauders are the other new infantry unit , and these heavy assault troops serve as a fantastic counter to any early / midgame vehicle rush .
Late game , Terrans can drop their signature nukes on enemy bases , and the high end of Terran power is more terrifying than ever .
In my experience , Terrans have an easier time switching gears mid-match than the other races do , as they rely less on researching a bunch of specialized upgrades and more on a diverse set of units .
The transforming Viking aircraft / assault mech is a perfect example of this adaptability .
With the Science Vessel replaced by the turret - deploying Raven , Medics removed , and the addition of new beefy infantry and aircraft , Terrans are more straightforward than the other factions .
They 're no less deadly , though .
Zerg
The swarming insectoids have a bunch of new tricks up their carapaces in StarCraft II .
Burrowing is even more central to the Zerg playstyle , with Roaches gaining super - regeneration underground and Infestors able to move while burrowed .
The biggest change is to the early game , where Roaches provide a weaker but cheaper and earlier ranged option than Hydralisks ( which are relatively larger now ) .
Banelings can counter any massed ground assault with their suicidal explosions .
Base defense is much different .
Zerg defensive turrets can now uproot and relocate like Ancients in Warcraft III , though they lose any offensive capability while mobile .
Between that and Queens being changed to a purely defensive unit that empowers Zerg buildings and can speed up Larva generation , Zerg can reasonably turtle and boom to their high - end units more effectively than before .
My favorite StarCraft II unit at the moment is the Zerg Brood Lord , which replaces Guardian Aspects as the faction 's ultimate flier .
Rather than attack directly , Brood Lords spawn and fire short - lived Broodlings , which as before are like crappy Zerglings .
They make a lot of them , though , and like Carriers are able to stay out of harm 's way while their minions do the work .
Protoss
The Protoss feel the most changed to me .
Zealots are still their early - game mainstays ( and their new Charge ability is awesome ) .
The permanently cloaked Dark Templar are still hilarious when your opponent is n't expecting them , as well .
However , the Protoss have gotten far trickier thanks to a renewed focus on their psionic abilities in StarCraft II .
Psi Storm is just the start of it .
Stalkers , which partially replace Dragoons as your primary early Zealot support , can give opponents fits with their short - ranged teleportation .
Sentries are available right off the bat .
They can slow enemy units or shield your own , and can be upgraded to distract your enemies with phantom units via Hallucination .
Finally , the Mothership replaces the Arbiter .
More expensive than a Battlecruiser , the Mothership can bend time and gravity to disable enemies and passively cloaks nearby friendlies .
Most interestingly , Gateways can go into Warp Gate mode and build units directly onto any powered ( via Pylon ) area of the map at the cost of slower builds .
Instant assaults and reinforcements change the course of a match very quickly .
Though they 're not lacking for strength , the Protoss have more potential for deviousness and misdirection than even the Zerg .
Cutting - Edge Robotic Exoskeleton Allows Wheelchair - Bound to Stand and Walk Cutting edge medicine : robotic suit enables wearers to walk again .
Feb . 4 , 2010  --
When Floyd Morrow 's spinal cord was severed in 2006 , doctors told him he would never take another step , but a revolutionary new device will give Morrow and other paraplegics the chance to walk again .
" It 's the greatest thing , " Morrow , 62 , said , speaking about the first time he donned the device called ReWalk , a motorized exoskeleton that enables wheelchair users with permanent lower limb disabilities to stand , walk and even climb stairs .
" Just to be able to push a button and it's like , ' OK , let 's go . '
Go cruising down the hallway , oh , it 's awesome , " said Morrow , who lives just outside of Atlantic City , N.J .
He never imagined he'd be able to walk again after the 2006 boating accident that paralyzed him for good .
" I could n't see or speak , but I heard the break in my back , " he said .
He is among 14 people currently enrolled in the U.S. clinical trials of ReWalk , which is made by Argo Medical Technologies in Israel .
How It Works
ReWalk is a lightweight device comprising an upper body harness , backpack and full leg supports .
The supports have motorized hips and knees .
Advance motion sensors placed in the shoulder and connected to a backpack computer detect subtle changes in gravity , telling the device when a step needs to be taken .
Users control the movement of the leg supports with the help of crutches , so wearers must have the use of their upper bodies in order to control the device .
A battery pack provides three hours of continuous movement .
If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves ReWalk , researchers said they hope it will be available to the public by the end of 2010 .
It 's not yet known how much it will cost .
Device Offers Multiple Benefits
Dr. Alberto Esquenazi is leading the ReWalk's U.S. trials at MossRehab , a rehabilitation and research center in Philadelphia .
" As a physician , you 're improving someone 's health .
Well , that 's hugely satisfactory .
But to take something that 's irreversible , like spinal cord injury , and allow someone to function again , that to me is a major step , " he noted .
In addition to the freedom ReWalk brings , developers say it offers additional health benefits .
Lack of exercise means spinal cord patients tend to have weak and brittle bones , but use of ReWalk can reverse that process , they say .
Woman Finds ReWalk Life - Changing
Alysse Einbender suffered a spinal stroke in 2004 .
The 50 - year - old from Wyncote , Pa. , is among the trial participants .
They get about 24 hours of training on the suit .
" You know , personally what the ReWalk has … meant to me , it 's shown me a lot of what my body can do , instead of all the things it can't do .
And it 's been hugely valuable to me , " she said .
Through ReWalk , 46 - year - old Ralph Filipkowski was able to stand without the use of a walker for the first time since 1985 .
That 's when the truck he was working under fell on top of him , leaving him paralyzed .
Wearing the ReWalk , Filipkowski stood , took a few steps , and offered a big smile .
" Good Morning America " anchor George Stephanopoulos tried the device himself during a recent visit to observe the trials .
He practiced standing up and sitting down , and was shocked at the suit 's power .
" It really does push you , " Stephanopoulos said .
Esquenazi said the system " does it all " for the user , but added , " you are in control .
If you want to take a step , you tell it when to take a step . "
Einbender said that being able to stand and take those steps has changed her life .
" Looking into somebody 's eyes for the first time at that height was ... really incredible , " she said .

The old saw that there is no such thing as bad publicity could be behind the success of The Coming Insurrection , published under the pen name the Invisible Committee , which rejects the official Left and aligns itself with the younger , wilder forms of resistance that have emerged in Europe against immigration control and the " war on terror . "
Published by Semiotext(e ) , a small California press , best known for works of French cultural theory by Jean Baudrillard and Michel Foucault , the book has spent much of the week on Amazon 's top 10 bestsellers list , alongside better known titles like Game Change and The Help .
True , when Semiotext ( e ) launched its Intervention series last August with an English translation of The Coming Insurrection , it hit # 24 at Amazon .
After that it settled back to more typical numbers for a book with a 3,000 - copy first printing , distributed by an academic press ( MIT ) .
Plus it 's available for free online in both English and French .
But even before the official pub date , The Coming Insurrection benefited from an " endorsement " from Glenn Beck .
As part of a seven - minute rant on Fox News in July , he said , " I am not calling for a ban on this book .
It 's important that you read this book . "
Since then , each time Beck has talked about the book , sales have spiked , according to MIT Press associate publicist Diane Denner .
It 's latest jump came after Beck devoted an entire segment to The Coming Insurrection , which he called " quite possibly the most evil thing I 've ever read . "
The book 's initial U.S. launch was equally , well , anarchistic .
It began with an unscheduled reading on a summer evening at the Union Square Barnes & Noble in New York City .
The reader refused to leave until the police arrived .
Then the reading regrouped at a nearby cosmetics store .
As a result of the publicity generated by the reading , which was written up in the New York Times , as well as reviews and Beck attacks , The Coming Insurrection is now in its sixth printing .
" We 're having trouble keeping stock in the warehouse , " says MIT Press assistant director Rebecca Schrader .
" And we 're dealing with reprint quantities that we do n't see every day . "
Written following the 2005 riots in the Paris suburbs , The Coming Insurrection has generated its fair share of negative publicity in France , where it was published in 2007 .
The French government called it a manual of terror and arrested a group of people in 2008 known as the Tarnac 9 , one of whom , it alleged , was the book 's author .
The Tarnac 9 were accused of disabling power lines that stranded thousands of passengers on high - speed trains .
As of last May , The Coming Insurrection had sold 25,000 copies in France , according to its French publisher , La Fabrique .
The French weekly magazine L'Express puts the number higher , at 40,000 .
Facebook Refuses to Remove Group Promoting Anti-Cyclist Violence
Screenshot from the Facebook group promoting dooring , among other acts that injure cyclists .
A
number of Streetsblog readers have noticed a particularly loathsome
group that has sprouted up on Facebook and has a legion of fans .
As of
this writing , more than 32,000 people are fans of " There ’s a perfectly good bike path right next to the road you stupid cyclist , "
a group page with a bunch of anti-cyclist screeds and some pretty nasty
photos of bicycle crashes and car - on - bike violence .
Facebook has
concluded that the group does not violate the site ’s terms of use and
will not shut it down .
" It ’s a stupid and offensive joke and unfortunately there are still
people who do n’t see that bicyclists have the same rights as
everyone else , " said Marc Caswell , Program Manager at the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition .
" It ’s a cruel example of the
ignorance of cyclists ’ rights .
We would encourage people to report it
as offensive . "
The
site is full of the vitriol one has come to expect online and in
anonymous comment sections , but unlike blogs or online forums , all the
fuming leaves a clear path to the users who posted it .
The first user to link the group was from Australia , and several of the references to road rules
are of British provenance or from former British colonies .
In the
" About Me " section , it reads : " No matter how far to the left you are ,
you ’re taking up my road .
My car is hard , and i am not slowing down ! "

In addition to creating a counter group called " HELP REMOVE this HATE GROUP against cyclists ! " ,
a number of cyclists have become fans of the original group and have
posted agitprop in the form of bicycle photos .
While there are
disturbing photos of cars creaming cyclists and road signs promoting
violence against cyclists , the photo album is full of pictures of the
kind of bike porn you might expect on Bike Blog or Fixed Gear Gallery .
And there are easily as many photos of " Share the Road " signs as the opposite .
Streetsblog asked Facebook whether this group violates their Terms of Use , particularly sections 6 and 7 , under
" Safety " :
6 . You will not bully , intimidate , or harass any user .
7 .
You will not post content that is hateful , threatening , pornographic ,
or that contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence .
Facebook’s
Simon Axten told us the group has been reviewed and deemed kosher by
the company ’s staff .
Presumably the reason they are not removing this
group boils down to how one interprets the phrase " actionable threats
of violence . "
Here ’s Axten ’s explanation :
We
take our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities very seriously and
react quickly to remove reported content that violates our policies .
Specifically , we ’re sensitive to content that includes hate speech
and / or actionable threats of violence .
The goal of these policies is to
strike a very delicate balance between giving Facebook users the
freedom to express their opinions and beliefs , even controversial ones ,
and maintaining a safe and trusted environment .
We ’ve reviewed
this group and determined that it does n’t violate our policies .
We
encourage users to report anything they feel does violate these
policies using the report links located throughout the site .
Thanks .

WITH heavy snow covering Britain for the 21st day in a row , people across the country were last night showing the first signs of starting to freak out .
As the Met Office warned that the blizzards would continue indefinitely , friends and neighbours in the midlands and the south east began taking it in turn to lose it , just a little bit , and then hit each other very hard across the face .
On the roads the RAC reported a 48 % increase in nervous laughter and sounding the horn for no reason and in the nation 's pubs , drinkers were making light of the extreme conditions while surveying the room and deciding who they are going to eat and in what order .
Tom Logan , from Finsbury Park , said : " There is something about this that just does n't feel right , you know ?
I mean … you know … what happens if it does n't melt ?
What if Dennis Quaid was right and this really is the start of a new ice age ?
" I 'm telling you now , I wo n't last five minutes in an ice age .
My feet are too small and I 'm really bald .
And I 'll get lost or I 'll fall through the glass roof of a shopping centre that has been completely covered by snow .
And of course I can't go and live in Spain , I 'm a vegetarian .
For Christ 's sake , someone hit me in the face ! "
Jill Kramer , from Peterborough , said : " Just before my husband went to get a loaf of bread this morning , he turned to me , looked deep into my eyes and said that he would always love me and that no matter what happened we would meet again . "
She added : " He 's been gone now for almost six minutes .
I hope he did n't suffer .
If you 'll excuse me I have to go and update the relationship status on my Facebook page . "
Margaret Gerving , a retired headmistress from Guildford , said the conditions were still not as bad as the winter of 1959 , adding : " I 'm going to make a big pot of soup , a big pot of stew and a tray of my famous fudge brownies .
And then I 'm going to rampage up and down the cul de sac with a fucking great axe shouting ' heeeeere 's Margaret ' .
" And to answer your next question – probably leek and potato . "

Owning a home is not everyone ’s dream .
Why buy and pay for repairs and taxes when you can rent and let someone else handle it all ?
True , there are pluses and advantages to both owning and renting , but when you consider moving to a new city , renting is always the best option .
Here are five reasons why Palm Gardens RV Park is appealing to the masses :
1. You ’re Not Tied to One Area
There is nothing worse than buying a home and finding out that you do n’t like the area or your neighbors .
When you rent a luxury apartment , you can pick up and move when your lease is up .
You are not tied down , and you have flexibility .
Owning a home puts a lot of restrictions on your family that you may not want in the short term .
2. Someone Else Pays the Maintenance Costs and Repair Bills
If the HVAC system malfunctions in a home you own , you may need to shell out thousands of dollars to get it fixed .
What if the house floods and causes significant damage ?
Sure , you have insurance , but you must pay deductibles and deal with contractors .
Having a landlord means more than just having someone to collect the rent .
Landlords deal with all the stressful things about ownership .
You just make a call day or night , and they send someone to fix the problem .
It does n’t cost you anything .
Repairs can be quite extensive and expensive , but renting a luxury apartment puts the responsibility on someone else .
3. Forget Real Estate Taxes
Currently , Arizona cities charge a tax rate of .87 percent through 1.5 percent of the value of the home .
It ’s a heavy burden to add to an already high mortgage .
Property taxes are a substantial financial burden as the costs of homes keep increasing .
When you are a renter , you do n’t need to worry about the taxes at all .
You just pay your rent , and the landlord takes care of all the extra costs associated with the building .
4. You Do n’t Need A Big Down - payment
One of the worst parts about buying a home is coming up with a substantial down payment .
When you are renting a luxury apartment , you only need the deposit and first month ’s rent .
There may be some other small fees , like pet costs , but it ’s nowhere near what you will pay to purchase a house .
Save your money to explore the town , and it ’s always wise to build a nest egg for when the time is right to buy .
5. You ’ll Have Expensive Amenities You Can’t Live Without
One thing that makes renting in a luxury situation more appealing than buying is that you get access to amenities .
Putting an in - ground pool in your backyard can cost tens of thousands of dollars .
However , if you choose the right location , you can have more than one pool to enjoy .
What about a fitness facility ?
It ’s expensive to buy one piece of equipment let alone a vast selection .
It ’s just another offering of a high scale apartment community .
It ’s easier to pay a small monthly fee to access all these things rather than the high installation and maintenance costs .
New 360 FF13 Screenshots feature nasty JPEG Compression , Mouse Pointer February 17 , 2010
Square Enix PR is having it a bit rough these past few days , it seems .
Late last week they were accused of faking FF13 360 screenshots by photoshopping 360 buttons onto PS3 screens , and now they 've released a batch of screens that have been seemingly hastily captured .
The screenshots sport particularly nasty JPEG compression , while some feature strange black borders that suggest speedy cropping .
One even features the mouse of the person who captured them , suggesting they may well have been captured from a video using the Windows Print Screen function .
The new batch of screenshots were released to appease the backlash from the edited 360 shots .
Not the best look for the Xbox 360 version .
The screenshot that includes the mouse of the person doing the work trapped in the top left corner has been posted with the mouse circled handily by us below .
The rest of the shots can be found over at IGN and TeamXbox .
SE PR team - we love you guys - but come on !
Do n't take these screenshots as any indication of how the 360 version looks - we 've played it and while it does n't look as good as the PS3 version , it does n't look as bad as this JPEG compression makes out .

( And that is one of like ten other ways he attempted to tie the death of tens of thousands to Barack Obama , somehow . ) [ Related ? ]
WASHINGTON — President Obama yesterday rolled out the red carpet — and handed out doctors ’ white coats as well , just so nobody missed his hard - sell health - care message .
In a heavy - handed attempt at reviving support for health - care reform , the White House orchestrated a massive photo op to buttress its claim that front - line physicians support Obama .
PHOTOS : OBAMA’S BOTCHED PHOTO OP
OBAMA LIFTS HEALTH CARE ADDRESS — FROM HIMSELF
A sea of 150 white - coated doctors , all enthusiastically supportive of the president and representing all 50 states , looked as if they were at a costume party as they posed in the Rose Garden before hearing Obama ’s pitch for the Democratic overhaul bills moving through Congress .
The physicians , all invited guests , were told to bring their white lab coats to make sure that TV cameras captured the image .
But some docs apparently forgot , failing to meet the White House dress code by showing up in business suits or dresses .
So the White House rustled up white coats for them and handed them to the suited physicians who had taken seats in the sun-splashed lawn area .
All this to provide a visual counter to complaints from other doctors that pending legislation is bad news for the medical profession .
“ Nobody has more credibility with the American people on this issue than you do , ” Obama told his guests .
The president was flanked by four white - coated doctors at a podium as he delivered his pep talk .
“ When you cut through all the noise and all the distractions that are out there , I think what ’s most telling is that some of the people who are most supportive of reform are the very medical professionals who know the health - care system best , ” the president said .
“ I want to thank every single doctor who is here , ” Obama said .
“ And I especially want to thank you for agreeing to fan out across the country and make the case about why this reform effort is so desperately needed . ”
Underlying the strictly photo - op nature of the event , The Associated Press noted that Obama broke no new ground in his remarks .
The president told the doctors that if they back him , “ I ’m confident we are going to get health reform passed this year . ”
The Republican National Committee shot back with a response from Rep. Tom Price ( R - Ga. ) , who was an orthopedic surgeon before being elected to Congress .
“ Today , the president wants you to believe that the medical community supports his government takeover of health care .
Do n’t be fooled , ” Price said .
He said he had spoken to “ thousands of my colleagues ” who oppose the Democrats ’ legislation .
House Minority Leader Rep. John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) said large numbers of doctors fear it would cripple their ability to care for patients .
“ Members of the medical community — who deal with red tape day in and day out — rightly recognize that the Democrats ’ government takeover would weaken the doctor - patient relationship that is so critical to making the right health - care decisions , ” he said .
Obama made no mention of the “ public option ” — a controversial government - run insurance plan favored by liberal Democrats — in his Rose Garden spiel .
A key version of the legislation , which does n’t include the public option , is expected to reach the Senate floor for debate later this month .

Here ’s a weird story .
And I think we have the internet to thank for discovering the weirdness .
Last night the New York Times printed an AP story about the United Nations ’ followup to the Goldstone report , titled " UN Chief Praises Israel Probe of Its Gaza Actions . "
Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon says in a 72 - page report Thursday night to the General Assembly that ” Israel followed up on every allegation . ”
It turns out the Secretary - General never said that .
Israel said it .
In today ’s briefing at the UN , the UN made the point that Ban Ki-moon said no such thing .
It explained that the 72 - page report was mostly Israel ’s report .
It included just three pages from the Sec ’y Gen’l .
The Spokesperson noted that in the document submitted by the Secretary - General to the General Assembly on the Goldstone report , only the first three pages are written by the Secretary - General and the Secretariat .
The remainder of the document consists of annexes containing information provided , respectively , by the Government of Israel , the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine and the Permanent Mission of Switzerland .
Confused ?
Here is the 72 - page UN report released yesterday .
The Secy Gen’l ’s judgment at the start is noncommital :
It is my sincere hope that General Assembly resolution 64/10 has served to encourage investigations by the Government of Israel and the Palestinian side that are independent , credible and in conformity with international standards .
I note from the materials received that the processes initiated by the Government of Israel and the Government of Switzerland are ongoing …
As such , no determination can be made on the implementation of the resolution by the parties concerned .
The long Israeli response follows ( and is not clearly identified ) .
In paragraph 185 , Israel pats itself on the back :
Because Israel followed up on every allegation , regardless of whether the source was neutral , hostile , or friendly , it launched investigations into 150 separate incidents , including 36 criminal investigations opened thus far .
AP seems to have revised its coverage .
But as Mark Twain said , a lie goes around the world in the time it takes the truth to tie its shoes .
This discovery was published at reddit , which says that the mistake demonstrates pro-Israel bias in the press .
It was brought to my attention by a reader .
Note that I also published the mistake !
McCain aside , the most common last - ditch argument for preserving “ do n’t ask ” heard last week , largely from Southern senators , is to protect “ troop morale and cohesion . ”
Every known study says this argument is a canard , as do the real - life examples of the many armies with openly gay troops , including those of Canada , Britain and Israel .
But the argument does carry a telling historical pedigree .
When Harry Truman ordered the racial integration of the American military in 1948 , Congressional opponents ( then mainly Southern Democrats ) embraced an antediluvian Army prediction from 1940 stating that such a change would threaten national defense by producing “ situations destructive to morale . ”
History will sweep this bogus argument away now as it did then .

Those opposing same - sex marriage are just as eager to mask their bigotry .
The big arena on that issue is now in California , where the legal showdown over Proposition 8 is becoming a Scopes trial of sorts , with the unlikely bipartisan legal team of David Boies and Ted Olson in the Clarence Darrow role .
The opposing lawyer , Charles Cooper , insisted to the court that he bore neither “ ill will nor animosity for gays and lesbians . ”
Given the history of the anti-same - sex marriage camp , it ’s hard to make that case with a straight face ( so to speak ) .
In trying to do so , Cooper moved that graphic evidence of his side ’s ill will and animosity be disallowed  including that notorious , fear - mongering television ad , “ The Gathering Storm . ”
The judge admitted such exhibits anyway .
Boies also triumphed in dismantling an expert witness called to provide the supposedly empirical , non-homophobic evidence of how same - sex marriage threatens “ procreative marriage . ”
In cross-examination , Boies forced the witness , David Blankenhorn of the so - called Institute for American Values , to concede he had no academic expertise in any field related to marriage or family .
The only peer - reviewed paper he ’s written , for a degree in Comparative Labor History , was “ a study of two cabinetmakers ’ unions in 19th - century Britain . ”
In another , milder cross-examination  on “ Meet the Press ” last weekend  John Boehner , the House G.O.P. leader , fended off a question about “ do n’t ask ” with a rhetorical question of his own :
“ In the middle of two wars and in the middle of this giant security threat , why would we want to get into this debate ? ”
Besides Mullen ’s answer  that it is the right thing to do  there ’s another , less idealistic reason why President Obama might want to get into it .
The debate could blow up in the Republicans ’ faces .
A protracted battle or filibuster in which they oppose civil rights will end up exposing the deep prejudice at the root of their arguments .
That ’s not where a party trying to expand beyond its white Dixie base and woo independents wants to be in 2010 .
Polls consistently show that independents , however fiscally conservative , are closer to Democrats than Republicans on social issues .
( In May ’s Gallup survey , 67 percent of independents favored repealing “ do n’t ask . ” )
This is why Scott Brown , enjoying what may be a short - lived honeymoon in his own party , calls himself a “ Scott Brown Republican . ”
A Scott Brown Republican is n’t a Boehner or Hatch Republican .
In his interview with Barbara Walters last weekend , he distanced himself from Sarah Palin , said he was undecided on “ do n’t ask ” and declared same - sex marriage a “ settled ” issue in his state , Massachusetts , where it is legal .
It ’s in this political context that we can see that there may have been some method to Obama ’s troublesome tardiness on gay issues after all .
But as we learned about this White House and the Democratic Congress in the health care debacle , they are perfectly capable of dropping the ball at any moment .
Let ’s hope they do n’t this time .
Should they actually press forward on “ do n’t ask ” in an election year with Mullen and Gates on board  and with even McCain ’s buddy , Joe Lieberman , calling for action “ as soon as possible ”  they could further the goal and raise the political price for those who stand in the way .
Recalcitrant Congressional Republicans will have to explain why their perennial knee - jerk deference to “ whatever the commanders want ” extends to Gen. David Petraeus and Gen. Stanley McChrystal on troop surges but not to Mullen , who outranks them , on civil rights .
The more bigotry pushed out of the closet for all voters to see , the more likely it is that Americans will be moved to grant overdue full citizenship to gay Americans .
It wo n’t happen overnight , any more than full civil rights for African - Americans immediately followed Truman ’s desegregation of the armed forces .
But there can be no doubt that Mike Mullen ’s powerful act of conscience last week , just as we marked the 50th anniversary of the Greensboro , N.C. , lunch counter sit-in , pushed history forward .
The revealing silence that followed from so many of the usual suspects was pretty golden too .
WASHINGTON  Akio Toyoda , the president of Toyota , was billed as the main attraction at a House hearing Wednesday into the company ’s recalls of millions of cars  recalls for which he profusely apologized and took personal responsibility .
But the transportation secretary , Raymond LaHood , offered more surprises in testimony that was sometimes heated , including many occasions when he was unable or declined to answer detailed questions about his department ’s dealings with the auto company .
Both men spent hours before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , one of three Congressional panels investigating the recall of more than six million vehicles and the delay in responding to problems of sudden acceleration .

This vegan pancake recipe calls for ingredients you might have at hand at home and requires very little time to make .
While you brew your morning coffee , the batch will be ready !
It uses soy milk ( or any other vegan milk substitute ) as the liquid and the result is a batch of perfectly light and fluffy pancakes .
Coconut milk gives a creamier texture , while almond or cashew milk adds a nutty flavor .
You can cook the pancakes in vegan margarine for a really decadent treat ; our favorite vegan butter substitute is Earth Balance , but vegetable oil works well .
Choose an oil that does n't add too much to the flavor ( like hazelnut or avocado ) , unless using coconut oil which will fill the pancakes with an amazing taste of coconut and a beautiful golden color .
Extended jobless benefits start ending
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Depending on extended unemployment benefits to see you through the Great Recession ?
You 'd better not :
The Senate failed to push back the Feb. 28 deadline to apply for this safety net .
Starting Monday , the jobless will no longer be able to apply for federal unemployment benefits or the COBRA health insurance subsidy .
Federal unemployment benefits kick in after the basic state - funded 26 weeks of coverage expire .
During the downturn , Congress has approved up to an additional 73 weeks , which it funds .
These federal benefit weeks are divided into tiers , and the jobless must apply each time they move into a new tier .
Because the Senate did not act , the jobless will now stop getting checks once they run out of their state benefits or current tier of federal benefits .
That could be devastating to the unemployed who were counting on that income .
In total , more than one million people could stop getting checks next month , with nearly 5 million running out of benefits by June , according to the National Unemployment Law Project .
Lawmakers repeatedly tried to approve a 30 - day extension this week , but each time , Sen. Jim Bunning , R - Ky. , prevented the $ 10 billion measure from passing , saying it needs to be paid for first .
" Right now , the 1.2 million workers who will lose benefits in March are being held hostage by partisan attempts to delay and block this critical legislation , " said Christine Owens , executive director of the National Employment Law Project .
Senate Democrats plan to introduce legislation this week that pushes back the deadline as much as a year , an aide said .
The House approved a bill in December that extended the deadline to the end of June .
Sen. Jon Kyl , R - Ariz. , said on " Fox News Sunday " that Republicans will support a temporary extension of the deadline this week .
But he said there would be debate over how to pay for a more long - term extension , saying Republicans want to know how the government will pay for the extended benefits .
Of course , once the measure is approved , the jobless would be able to reapply for federal benefits , though they would not receive missed payments .
Critical checks
About 11.5 million people currently depend on jobless benefits .
Nearly one in 10 Americans are out of work and a record 41.2 % have been unemployed for at least six months .
The average unemployment period lasts a record 30.2 weeks .
The unemployment rate , which now stand at 9.7 % , is expected to rise in February as snowstorms in many states disrupted the economy and stalled hiring .
While unemployment benefits now run as long as 99 weeks , depending on the state , not everyone will receive checks for that long a stretch if the deadline to apply is not extended .
Those extended benefits are vital , experts said .
While the economy is slowly recovering , hiring is expected to remain slow in coming years .
The unemployment rate is expected to remain at about 10 % this year , according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers , and wo n't fall back to its 2008 level of 5.8 % for another seven years .
" Those benefits will expire , but the need to heat their homes and put gas in their cars does n't expire , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , on Friday .
" Those benefits will expire , but the need to take their medicine , or support an aging parent , or take care of their children does n't expire .
Congressional gridlock
The jobless have anxiously watched from the sidelines as efforts to push back the deadlines took many twists and turns in recent weeks .
The extensions were included in an $ 85 billion bipartisan job creation draft bill that was unveiled in the Senate earlier this month .
But then Reid decided to introduce a slimmed - down version that stripped them out , forcing lawmakers to vote on them as a stand - alone measure this week .
In order to speed the process along , the House on Thursday passed a bill extending the deadline to apply for unemployment insurance to April 5 and for COBRA benefits to March 28 .
That way , the Senate could have just approved the legislation and sent it directly to the president 's desk .
However , Bunning 's continued objection blocked Senate approval of the bill Friday .
This is not the first time unemployment insurance benefits -- which enjoy wide bipartisan support -- have fallen prey to politics .
Last fall , the House approved adding up to 20 weeks to the federal benefits period .
But it took seven weeks for the Senate to send it to the president 's desk , during which time more than 200,000 people stopped receiving checks .
When lawmakers finally took up the measure , it passed by a 98 - 0 vote .

“ The assassination of someone as senior as Mabhouh has rung an alarm bell in Hamas , ” the official told .
“ Only a few people in the Hamas leadership knew about Mabhouh ’s secret activities and movements .
” The official said that many Hamas officials in the Gaza Strip and Syria were convinced that the Mossad has infiltrated the movement ’s top ranks .
“ Obviously , the assassination of Mabhouh is a huge security blunder for Hamas , because it shows that the Israeli agents are sitting among our leaders in Damascus .
” The Hamas official said Hamas was also looking into the possibility that Israel has infiltrated the Syrian security services , which are responsible for the safety of the leaders of all the radical Palestinian groups based in Damascus , including Hamas .
“ We do n’t rule out the possibility that the Israelis or some other security agency that works with them have recruited a senior Syrian intelligence officer who feeds them with details about the movements and whereabouts of representatives of Hamas and other groups , particularly Hizbullah , ” he said .
Meanwhile , Hamas appears to be divided over the question of whether it should attack Israeli and Jewish targets around the world to avenge the killing of its top operative .
Some Hamas officials warned that “ exporting ” the fight against Israel to the international arena would jeopardize the movement ’s efforts to seek recognition by the West .
A Hamas representative in the West Bank urged his movement to abide by its long - standing policy of refraining from attacking Israeli and Jewish targets outside the Palestinian territories and Israel .
He predicted that despite the threats , Hamas would not “ change the rules of the game ” by carrying out terrorist attacks abroad .
Hamas ’s “ foreign minister , ” Osama Hamdan , hinted that his movement has no intention to launch terrorist attacks on Israelis and Jews around the world .
“ Hamas wo n’t be dragged to the square where the Israelis want to take us , ” he said .
“ Hamas makes its decisions in a balanced manner and in accordance with the interests of the Palestinian people .
” Hamdan , who is Hamas ’s representative in Lebanon , said his movementdoes not make hasty decisions based on “ emotional ” considerations .
Shortly after blaming Israel for the killing of Mabhouh , a number ofsenior Hamas officials , including Mahmoud Zahar , declared that theirmovement would seek revenge outside Israel and the Palestinianterritories .
Hamas ’s armed wing , Izzadin Kassam , issued a similarthreat .
Interested in Redis ?
You might be interested in the Redis Handbook I 'm currently working on .
I 'm gonna eat my own dog food here , and start you off with a collection of links and ideas of people using Redis .
Redis ' particular way of treating data requires some rethinking how to store your data to benefit from speed , atomicity and its data types .
I 've already written about Redis in abundance , this post 's purpose is to compliment them with real - world scenarios .
Maybe you can gather some ideas on how to deal with things .
There 's a couple of well - known use cases already , the most popular of them being Resque , a worker queue .
RestMQ , an HTTP - based worker queue using Redis , was just recently released too .
Both do n't make use yet of the rather new blocking pop commands like Redactor does , so there 's still room for improvement , and to make them even more reliable .
Ohm is a library to store objects in Redis .
While I 'm not sure I 'd put this layer of abstraction on top of it , it 's well worth looking at the code to get inspiration .
Same is true for redis - types .
Redis ' simplicity , atomicity and speed make it an excellent tool when tracking things directly from the web , e.g. through WebSockets or Comet .
If you can use it asynchronously , all the better .
Using Redis to store any suitable kind of statistics is pretty much an immediate use case for a lot of web applications .
I could think of several projects I 've work on that could gain something from using certain parts of their application to Redis .
It 's the kind of data you just do n't want to clutter your database with .
Clicks , view , history and all that stuff puts an unnecessary amount of data and load on it .
The more data it accumulates , the harder it will be to get rid off , especially in MySQL .
It 's not hard to tell that we 're still far from having heaps of inspiration and real - life use cases to choose from , but these should give you an idea .
If you want it can get a lot simpler too .
When you 're using Redis already , it makes sense to use it for storing Rails sessions .
Redis is a great way to share data between different processes , be it Ruby or something else .
The atomic access to lists , strings and sets , together with speedy access ensures that you do n't even need to worry about concurrency issues when reading and writing data .
On Scalarium , we 're using it mostly for sharing data between processes .
E.g. , all communication between our system and clients on the instances we boot for our users is encrypted and signed .
To ensure that all processes have access to the keys , they 're stored conveniently in Redis .
Even though that means the data is duplicated from our main database ( which is Couch DB if you must know ) , access to Redis is a lot faster .
We keep statistics about the instances in Redis too , because CouchDB is just not made for writing heaps and heaps of data quickly .
Redis also tracks a request token that is used to authenticate internal requests in our asynchronous messaging system , to make sure that they can't be compromised from some external source .
Each request gets assigned a unique token .
The token is stored in Redis before the message is published and checked before the message is consumed .
That way we turned Redis into a trusted source for shared data between web and worker processes .
The library memodis makes sharing data incredibly easy , it offers Redis - based memoization .
When you assign a memodis'd attribute in your code , it 'll be stored in Redis and therefore can be easily read from other processes .
Redis is incredibly versatile , and if you have a real - life Redis story or usage scenario to share , please do .
December is one of our favorite months of the year , and it is not just because of the Christmas season even though the Christmas lights and everything jolly helps of course .
What makes the month unique is the variety of things you can see and do .
Many of them are of course possible to do [… ]
The Linux Foundation says that the market for Linux - related jobs has grown 80 percent over the past five years .
In response to this trend , the foundation is launching a Linux job board to help connect employers with potential candidates for Linux - related jobs .
The Linux Foundation , an advocacy and standardization group , obtained the Linux.com domain name from GeekNet last year .
The website hosts a variety of content and services for Linux users and programmers , including blogs and community - driven technical support .
The job board , which will be powered by th JobThread Network , is the latest addition to the website .
" Linux ' increasing use across industries is building high demand for Linux jobs despite national unemployment stats , " said Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin in a statement .
" Linux.com reaches millions of Linux professionals from all over the world .
By providing a Jobs Board feature on the popular community site , we can bring together employers , recruiters and job seekers to lay the intellectual foundation for tomorrow's IT industry . "
During the Linux Collaboration Summit last year , Zemlin declared Linux the " fastest growing platform " and touted an IDC study which contended that the open source operating system would endure the economic recession better than its competitors .
Although it 's still unclear if IDC 's speculation will prove true , the need for cost - cutting in the current economic climate has certainly helped to boost Linux adoption , a trend that is potentially contributing further to the growth of the Linux job market .
It 's not news that Britain has a lot of surveillance cameras , with around 60,000 run by local authorities alone .
However , most cameras record only images , which are normally kept for a few weeks .
Unless and until facial recognition technology improves significantly , these are not capable of creating a database of people 's movements .
But the police 's network of automatic numberplate recognition ( ANPR ) cameras – which now total 10,502 in England and Wales – already do just that .
The cameras aim to read the numberplate of every passing vehicle , with the data held for two years in the National ANPR Data Centre , regardless of whether the vehicle is linked to crime .
( A move to keeping it for five years appears to have been shelved , following discussions with the information commissioner 's office . )
Furthermore , the locations of most of the cameras , including some run by local authorities on behalf of the police , are secret .
This is unnecessary : normal CCTV cameras are accompanied by signs disclosing the responsible organisation , and speed cameras , which are on roadmaps , are signed and painted yellow .
Police ANPR has not attracted as much attention as other types of surveillance , except when its use has been controversial , such as stopping those who are innocent of crime but have been placed on a police watchlist .
Forces seem to take their own approaches .
Devon and Cornwall has disclosed that it uses ANPR in Torquay , Brixham and Dawlish , without giving precise locations or spending figures .
Thames Valley police , which has released details of spending but not locations , has put nearly £ 2 m into 47 fixed cameras , 31 in road vehicles , 11 portable kits and one in a helicopter .
Police argue that revealing camera locations would allow criminals to drive around them .
But that assumes that such villains lack reconnaissance abilities : ANPR equipment can be easy to spot for those who know what they are looking for .
Most of the cameras on motorways and A roads belong to the government 's Highways Agency ( and its equivalents in Scotland and Wales ) and private company Trafficmaster .
Both use special ANPR cameras that derive non-unique codes from passing numberplates .
Their central systems then look for the same code further down the road , to calculate average speeds for traffic information purposes .
Also , they usually monitor just one lane .
Observations suggest that the 100 - mile stretch of the M5 between Cheltenham and Exeter has lots of single cameras , but just one location with cameras for each lane , which are of a different shape and colour to those used by the Highways Agency and Trafficmaster .
A similar pattern can be seen on other motorways .
If there are relatively few police ANPR cameras on major roads and in forces such as Thames Valley , where are the bulk of the 10,502 ?
An educated guess would be big cities , particularly London .
But the secrecy makes it very difficult for the public to evaluate the worth of the technology .
Police forces should end the mystery of their fixed ANPR camera locations .
If these were published , rings of fixed cameras – such as that which covers every entrance to the centre of London – would still be effective , as they should catch all traffic entering the zone , and could in fact have a greater deterrent effect .
It would not affect mobile use of ANPR , and overall the use of the technology would become more accountable .
And if disclosure of location would make some standalone fixed cameras useless , it suggests that their efficacy is already dubious , and will decline as more people realise where they are .
Finally , it would mean the police were no longer using secret cameras to record the movements of millions of the people who pay their wages .
No policy is ever put forward by the Government without the use of the word " stakeholder " .
MPs could begin to address the problems raised in the Adair Turner report by becoming stakeholders in the pension crisis .
They , and other public sector workers , should be required to ditch their final - salary pensions and switch to schemes where the worker takes the risk .
The money saved should be used to boost the value of the state pension , which for many pensioners is the only income they have to show after 50 years ' worth of hefty taxes .
In the years approaching the credit crunch , whistleblowers were limited to a few insightful economists and financial journalists .
Now whistles are blowing again about another grave threat to the global economy and the security of nations .
They warn of an oil crunch : an unexpected crash in global production such that supply can no longer meet demand , even if China and India throttle back .
This time the warning is not limited to a prescient few individuals .
Major British companies , led by Virgin , Scottish and Southern and Stagecoach , are flagging the danger , in today 's report from the UK industry taskforce on peak oil and energy security .
So too are the CEOs of oil companies themselves , in the case of Total and Petrobras , and growing numbers of other senior oil industry figures , usually recently retired .
Even the International Energy Agency is sounding the alert , in a coded sort of way .
With modern economies geared to their rivets on just - in - time supply of copious amounts of affordable oil , society surely ignores this risk issue at its massive peril .
But that is what BP , Exxon , Saudi Aramco and many other institutions of the hydrocarbon era would have us do .
And theirs is the perceived wisdom .
I do not know of a single company , outside the taskforce group , where peak oil is on the agenda as a serious risk issue .
As for government , Whitehall 's official line is typical , as things stand : there is 40 years of oil supply , no need to worry , and certainly no crisis .
To be fair , that view may be in the process of changing , in the light of recent events in the energy markets .
The taskforce report is the second such .
The first , published during the financial crisis in October 2008 , charted global production capacity coming onstream , factored in depletion , and found that overall global production would peak in 2013 , and then fall rapidly while demand continued to rise .
The taskforce worried that things could be worse even than this early peak in oil production , if other risks we are concerned about kick in : more giant - oilfield production collapsing in the manner of Mexico , flaws emerging in reserves estimates in Opec countries , and so on .
In 2009 came the recession , and a steep fall in global demand for oil .
This has helped , in the narrow sense of that word .
It may have bought us two more years .
The new report projects production dropping in 2015 , though the risks that it could be earlier remain .
The CEOs and chairmen of the taskforce companies have a simple message for government .
This monster threat is very likely to descend on the next government in office , in their first term , and the nation needs to act now .
The stakes are arguably higher than with the financial crisis .
The taskforce 's worst - case fear is that premature peak oil will involve not just global energy crisis , but potentially energy famine for some oil importing nations – including the UK .
During the financial crash the world went within weeks from a received wisdom that investment banks had squeezed risk out of complex derivatives , to a spiralling doubt , to a tipping point of disbelief and panic .
With peak oil , officials around the world , corporate and governmental , would experience exactly the same collapse of confidence in their cosy cultural assumptions .
A second giant industry would have been found to have its asset assessment systemically and ruinously wrong .
The net impact would be that oil - producing nations would begin to husband their own resources : keeping exports back for use in their own oil - hungry multi- hundred - billion dollar - and - rouble infrastructure programmes .
This is a scenario that could lead to food delivery lorries failing to reach Tesco in time for Friday - night shopping .
The lessons from the financial crash ought to be stark .
The prevailing culture mocked the disbelievers , ahead of the crash .
Gillian
Tett , capital markets editor at the FT , saw the crisis coming because she was a trained anthropologist and knew how to recognise a cult when she saw one .
She was accused of scaremongering from the stage of the World Economic Forum .
The pattern is the same this time .
BP , in particular , has a tendency to mock the concept of peak oil and its advocates .
Meanwhile , as with the climate crisis , there is a general desperation to believe the comforting narrative ahead of the uncomfortable one .
This is why it is so important that companies who understand risk speak out , as the taskforce companies have .
It is why governments – who must lead in matters of national security – should listen to the uncomfortable arguments and , given the stakes , buy insurance against them .
History is going to judge us all on how we manage the risk of premature peak oil .
And soon .

John McCain 's staunch opposition to gay marriage was one of the key parts of his presidential campaign .
But it has become clear this was not supported in his own household .
His daughter , Meghan , is a vocal advocate of gay rights .
Now his wife , Cindy , has appeared in a poster campaign against California 's proposition 8 – a law banning same - sex marriage .
The move has shocked and delighted gay rights campaigners and led to questions about the state of the McCains ' own marriage .
Cindy McCain appears in the poster with silver duct tape across her mouth and the campaign slogan , " NOH8 " , marked on her cheek .
Unveiling the image on his website , Adam Bouska , the founder of the campaign , said : " In the year since we 've started the NOH8 Campaign we 've often been surprised at some of the different individuals who have approached us showing their support .
Few , though , have surprised us more than Cindy McCain .
" Aligning yourself with the platform of gay marriage as a Republican still tends to be very stigmatic , but Cindy McCain wanted to participate in the campaign to show people that party does n't matter . "
John McCain 's office said in a statement that he respected the views of his family but remained opposed to gay marriage .
" Senator McCain believes the sanctity of marriage is only defined as between one man and one woman , " it said .
In 2008 McCain backed a measure in his home state of Arizona to ban same - sex marriage .
Meghan McCain also appears in the poster campaign .
" I could n't be more proud of my mother for posing for the NOH8 campaign , " she wrote on Twitter .
" I think more Republicans need to start taking a stand for equality .
" I was there when she did it and I almost started crying during the photo shoot . "
Bloggers are suggesting that Cindy McCain 's move is a deliberate public dig at her husband .
Writing on gossip site Gawker , Maureen O'Connor praised both Cindy McCain and Elizabeth Edwards , the wife of the 2008 Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards , for defying their husbands on gay marriage .
" Is it a coincidence that these two couples are also in the public eye over marital woes ? " she wrote .
Pam Spaulding , who blogs on gay issues , was reminded of an infamous and foul - mouthed bust up between John and Cindy during a campaign in 1992 .
" Given the Senator 's hot temper , and the fact that he called his wife a trollop and ' you c*nt ' … this was a nice ' screw you ' for picking that dimwit Palin and derailing the campaign , " Spaulding wrote .
( The asterisk is Pam Spaulding 's , not ours . )
Eleven terrorists , including two “ foreigners , ” were killed in the latest US airstrike in Pakistan ’s Taliban - controlled tribal agency of North Waziristan .
Unmanned US aircraft struck a Taliban training camp in the Datta Khel region in North Waziristan twice today .
The second strike hit the Taliban as they attempted to recover bodies from the first strike .
“ Two foreigners died in the initial attack , ” a senior Pakistani security official told AFP .
“ Five militants were killed in the previous attack and six in this attack . ”
Dawn later put the number killed at 17 and said the death toll could go as high as 25 .
The identity of the foreigners , a term used to describe Arab members of al Qaeda , has not been disclosed .
No senior al Qaeda or Taliban leaders have been reported killed .
The Taliban were using a mud-brick fort in the village of Sanzali to carry out training .
The fort was run by North Waziristan Taliban commander Hafiz Gul Bahadar .
The Pakistani military signed another peace agreement with Bahadar this year .
Today ’s strike is the third this year and the fourth in one week .
It is also the fourth strike since an al Qaeda / Haqqani Network suicide bomber killed seven CIA officials , including the station chief , and a Jordanian intelligence officer , in an attack at Combat Outpost Chapman in Khost province .
The outpost was used to gather intelligence for strikes against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
The US has ramped up the strikes against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Pakistan ’s tribal areas since August 2008 .
There were 53 strikes in 2009 , 36 in 2008 , and 10 from 2004 - 2007 combined [ See LWJ report , “ Analysis : US air campaign in Pakistan heats up ” for more information . ]
North Waziristan has become the focal point of the US air campaign in Pakistan .
Since the Aug. 5 strike in South Waziristan that killed Baitullah Mehsud , the leader of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan , 18 of the 22 reported airstrikes have taken place in North Waziristan , while the other four were in South Waziristan .
The Datta Khel region in South Waziristan is a known haven for al Qaeda and allied Central Asian jihadi groups .
The US has conducted multiple strikes in the Datta Khel region , which is administered by Hafiz Gul Bahadar and the Haqqani Network .
The latest strike in Datta Khel , on Dec. 17 , 2009 , targeted Sheikh Saeed al Saudi , Osama bin Laden ’s brother - in - law and a member of al Qaeda ’s Shura Majlis , or executive council .
Al Saudi is thought to have survived the strike .
Datta Khel borders the Jani Khel region in the settled district of Bannu .
The Jani Khel region has long been a strategic meeting place and safe haven for al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Jani Khel was identified as the headquarters for al Qaeda ’s Shura Majlis back in 2007 .
Ayman al Zawahiri , al Qaeda ’s second in command , has operated in the Jani Khel region .
The US has struck al Qaeda safe houses in Jani Khel twice since last year .
These strikes are the only two Predator attacks that have occurred outside of Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
The town of Jani Khel is a known haven for al Qaeda leaders and fighters .
Senior al Qaeda operative Abdullah Azzam al Saudi was killed in a Predator strike in Jani Khel on Nov. 19 , 2008 .
Azzam served as a liaison between al Qaeda and the Taliban operating in Pakistan ’s northwest .
Al Qaeda is known to have deposited its donations received from Europe into the Bayt al Mal , or Bank of Money , in Jani Khel , according to a report at the NEFA Foundation .
The Bayt al Mal served as al Qaeda ’s treasury .
“ The money can only be released on Osama bin Laden ’s direction , and when such an order is given , it is Mustafa Abu Yazid who executes it , ” the NEFA Foundation report said .
Yazid , who is also known as Sheikh Saeed al Masri , is the leader of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and also serves as the group ’s chief financial operative .
US strikes in Pakistan in 2010 :
• US kills 11 in latest North Waziristan strike
Jan. 6 , 2010
• US airstrike kills 2 Taliban fighters in Mir Ali in Pakistan
Jan. 3 , 2010
• US kills 3 Taliban in second strike in North Waziristan

And there ’s not much that Spain ’s government can do to make things better .
The nation ’s core economic problem is that costs and prices have gotten out of line with those in the rest of Europe .
If Spain still had its old currency , the peseta , it could remedy that problem quickly through devaluation  by , say , reducing the value of a peseta by 20 percent against other European currencies .
But Spain no longer has its own money , which means that it can regain competitiveness only through a slow , grinding process of deflation .
Now , if Spain were an American state rather than a European country , things would n’t be so bad .
For one thing , costs and prices would n’t have gotten so far out of line : Florida , which among other things was freely able to attract workers from other states and keep labor costs down , never experienced anything like Spain ’s relative inflation .
For another , Spain would be receiving a lot of automatic support in the crisis : Florida ’s housing boom has gone bust , but Washington keeps sending the Social Security and Medicare checks .
But Spain is n’t an American state , and as a result it ’s in deep trouble .
Greece , of course , is in even deeper trouble , because the Greeks , unlike the Spaniards , actually were fiscally irresponsible .
Greece , however , has a small economy , whose troubles matter mainly because they ’re spilling over to much bigger economies , like Spain’s .
So the inflexibility of the euro , not deficit spending , lies at the heart of the crisis .
None of this should come as a big surprise .
Long before the euro came into being , economists warned that Europe was n’t ready for a single currency .
But these warnings were ignored , and the crisis came .
Now what ?
A breakup of the euro is very nearly unthinkable , as a sheer matter of practicality .
As Berkeley ’s Barry Eichengreen puts it , an attempt to reintroduce a national currency would trigger “ the mother of all financial crises . ”
So the only way out is forward : to make the euro work , Europe needs to move much further toward political union , so that European nations start to function more like American states .
But that ’s not going to happen anytime soon .
What we ’ll probably see over the next few years is a painful process of muddling through : bailouts accompanied by demands for savage austerity , all against a background of very high unemployment , perpetuated by the grinding deflation I already mentioned .
It ’s an ugly picture .
But it ’s important to understand the nature of Europe ’s fatal flaw .
Yes , some governments were irresponsible ; but the fundamental problem was hubris , the arrogant belief that Europe could make a single currency work despite strong reasons to believe that it was n’t ready .
With Windows 7 only recently released and by all accounts faring quite well amongst business and home users alike , it 's hard to imagine Microsoft plotting the release of Windows 8 for any year in the near future .
However , an ex-employee blog suggests otherwise .
Microsoft 's Windows 7 was released only in October ( the 22nd , to be exact ) , and since that time has turned Vista - haters and other critics into big fans of the Windows platform once again .
In a recent Windows 7 survey , digital content distributor Steam found that almost 1 in 4 of its users had converted to the new operating system ( OS ) -- a rather incredible adoption rate .
Rumor : Windows 8 Release July 2011
It 's surprising , then , that Microsoft may at this very moment be working on an update in the form of Windows 8 , its next OS .
How do we know ?
Well , we can't say for sure , but yesterday the blog of a recently - departed Microsoft employee showcased an early version of the Redmond - based firm's " roadmap " for upcoming critical software , including Windows 8 . ( Source : electronista.com )
If the roadmap is to be believed , Windows 8 could be released to manufacturing , a process often referred to as " RTM " as early as July 1st , 2011 -- about two years after the completion of Windows 7 .
The roadmap suggests Windows Server 2012 and Office 2012 would be shipped 366 days later , on July 2nd , 2012 .
( Source : ubergizmo.com )
Is Microsoft ' Speeding Up ' the Development Process ?
If the roadmap is to be believed , it would indicate Microsoft is significantly accelerating the development process and shortening the life - cycle of its operating systems .
While Windows 7 did ship only 2.5 years after Windows Vista , the latter was considered by many experts a failure -- forcing Microsoft to go back to the drawing board earlier than usual .
Similarly , the mostly - forgotten Windows ME was shipped two years after Windows 98 , but it was considered little more than a stopgap between that OS and Windows XP .
So , what should we believe ?
Expect that date will change significantly or that , if accurate , Windows 8 is a far less intensive project Microsoft will more casually push upon a rather confused marketplace .
The proliferation of NVIDIA's
Ion GPU
has been a long time coming .
We 've been talking about
its merits
for the better part of this year , but only recently has it been able to find its way into more than a handful of mainstream , shipping netbooks .
We recently had a look at
HP's Mini 311
with Windows 7 Home Premium , and while the Ion definitely enabled smooth HD playback where it was previously impossible with a paltry 1.6GHz Atom N270 and Intel IGP , the CPU bottleneck held back the entire system .
Today , however , we 're taking a look at a much more powerful system .
Asus has come a long way since the launch of its original Eee PC. 7 " and 8 " netbooks are no longer the norm , and the availability of 12 " netbooks is on the rise .
The newest member of the stylish Seashell lineup is the
Eee PC 1201N
, which easily bests any other
netbook
we 've tested in terms of specifications .
It 's also one of the larger netbooks out , blurring the line between the netbooks of old and the ultraportables of today .
Featuring a 12.1 " HD display , dual - core Atom 330 CPU , 2GB of DDR2 RAM , Windows 7 Home Premium , an HDMI output and NVIDIA 's Ion GPU technology , there 's not much to dislike about the newest Eee PC based on its build sheet .

Socialism / Anarchism / Libertarian Communism in one country
Does anyone think this is possible ?
Or does it require a world revolution ?
( for the record , i side with the latter , and hae been really confused by the numbers of anarchists who think you can build anarchism in one country , hence this post . )
Dear Cecil :
Where did the Grateful Dead get their name ?
What does it mean ?
I 've heard a lot of tales , but I 'll believe only you .
S. Seidman , Stevenson , Maryland
Cecil replies :
I am a rock of comfort , ai n’t I ?
The official story on the Grateful Dead , as related by Jerry Garcia in the book Playing in the Band , is as follows : “ We were standing around in utter desperation at Phil [ Lesh ] ’s house in Palo Alto [ trying to think up a name for the band ] .
There was a huge dictionary , big monolithic thing , and I just opened it up .
There in huge black letters was ` The Grateful Dead . ’
It … just cancelled my mind out . ”
I ’ll say — how often does the phrase “ grateful dead ” pop up in the average dictionary ?
But it turns out Garcia may not have hallucinated the whole thing after all .
In the Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore , Mythology and Legend , we find a page headed “ GRATEFUL DEAD ” in big type .
Beneath this is an entry to the effect that the “ grateful dead ” is a motif figuring in many folktales .
Further investigation has turned up a rare volume of folklore entitled The Grateful Dead by G.H. Gerould ( 1908 ) , lent to me by Straight Dope reader Charles Kroon .
In it we find a typical grateful - dead story :
Graf Willekin von Montabour … learned that a beautiful and rich maiden had promised her hand to [ whichever ] knight should win a tourney she had established .
Thereupon he set forth and came to the place announced for the combats .
There he found lodging in the house of a man who would only receive him if he paid the debts of a dead man , whose body lay unburied in the dung of a horse - stall .
Willekin was moved by this story and paid seventy marks , almost all his money , to ransom the corpse and give it suitable burial .
He then had to borrow money from his host in order to indulge in his customary generosity .
On the morning of the jousting he obtained from a stranger knight a fine horse on condition of dividing everything he won .
He succeeded in [ beating ] all the other contestants , and so wedded the maiden .
On the second night after the marriage the stranger entered his room and demanded a share in the marital rights .
After offering instead to give all his possessions , the hero started from the room in tears , when the stranger called him back and explained that he was the ghost of the [ presumably grateful ] dead , then disappeared . ”
Puts a different spin on “ Sugar Magnolia , ” I ’ll tell you that .
In other Dead news , I learn that John Epler , a leading bug authority and loyal Straight Dope reader , has named a newly discovered species of chironomid midge after the Dead , namely Dicrotendipes thanatogratus .
( Thanatos is Greek for death , gratus Latin for grateful . )
Abrim with boyish enthusiasm , he sent the band a note , but can you believe it , the ingrates ( oh , rich irony ! ) never bothered to reply !
Maybe they were turned off by the gauche commingling of Latin and Greek .
Or maybe they ’re just too jaded .
Whatever , when John names his second new bug , you can be sure I wo n’t forget the thank - you note .
Grateful Dead :
Not ungrateful after all
Dear Cecil :
As John Epler may already know , the Dead are no more efficient than they have to be .
The mail answerers are rummaging through the backlog in search of the Dicrotendipes thanatogratus note .
Your column was the first anyone had heard about it , and it ’s a nice flash .
For the record , naming the Dead took place at the house on High Street in Palo Alto on a November afternoon in 1965 .
The name was found in a regular Funk and Wagnalls dictionary , probably the 1956 edition .
Gerould ’s book on the “ grateful dead ” legends is lovely .
Stith Thompson also discusses them .
[ Typically the hero pays a dead man ’s debts so his corpse can be buried .
Later a stranger , who turns out to be the grateful dead man , joins the hero and offers his help , on condition that all winnings be equally divided . ]
Is the grateful dead man tempting you ?
Are you making a moral decision ?
The flat hit you get from the words “ grateful dead ” can be enhanced by pondering what life situations the g.d. tales represent .
When you listen to such tales you ’re living on that level of symbolic transaction .

Pour une fois , l'histoire se termine bien .
Le scénario : vendredi , vers 18 heures , une coulée de neige recouvre une voiture sur une petite route de montage non loin d'Uvernet - Fours , dans les Alpes de Haute - Provence .
L'engin et ses quatre occupants , trois Isérois et un Britannique , sont ensevelis sous quatre mètres de neige .
Panique générale .
Mais l'une des passagères parvient à creuser dans la neige .
Alors que ses amis randonneurs , tous âgés d'une trentaine d'années , sont coincés sous un enchevêtrement de tôle , elle creuse durant deux heures et parvient à se dégager un passage .
« Ce qui nous a sauvé , c'est qu'on avait les skis et les bâtons dans la voiture , raconte la miraculée sur RTL , lundi matin .
J'ai pu creuser avec une rondelle de bâton » .
La jeune femme s'extrait de la coulée de neige , marche pendant près d'une heure et , enfin parvenue dans un hameau , donne l'alerte .
« J'ai vu arriver une jeune femme complètement choquée , en pleurs » explique un habitant au Parisien .
Une quinzaine de secouristes s'activent alors .
Au final , tout le monde est sauvé .
Seuls deux des passagers sont légèrement blessés au visage , mais tous ont subi « un traumatisme fort » .
« Un petit miracle »
« C'est un petit miracle » se réjouit le sous - préfet de Barcelonnette , Jean - Marc Bassaget .
Il rappelle toutefois que la route empruntée par les randonneurs avait été fermée par le conseil général pour cause de manteau neigeux instable en raison du redoux .
« Cela doit servir d'exemple .
Quand le conseil général décide d'une fermeture de route , c'est qu'il y a des dangers potentiels , quand une route est fermée on ne s'engage pas » , a - t - il averti .
Aujourd ' hui encore , la route est fermée alors que le département reste en forte vigilance avalanche .
“ I find it interesting that you have a lot of the Republicans running around and pushing back on the stimulus money and saying this does n’t create any new jobs .
Then , they go out and they do the photo ops and they are posing with the big check and they say , ‘ Is n’t this great ? ' ”
A quote from a high - ranking Democratic official ?

Nope : Arnold Schwarzenegger , the Republican governor of California .
Democrats have begun to push back against GOP criticisms of their $ 862 billion stimulus package , noting that many of the Republicans who ’ve attacked the measure have sought funds themselves .
And the number of those who voted against the bill who have cashed in is growing .
According to a count by Bloomberg News , more than 100 Republicans and several Democrats who voted against the bill have written to collect on the cash they did n’t want spent .
Among the critics who ’ve now sought money from Obama Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood :
* Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham “ wrote LaHood asking for $ 360 million to improve Interstate 73 near Myrtle Beach .
The construction funding ‘ is expected to create 5,789 new jobs in the I - 73 corridor region , ’ said the letter , one of a dozen grant pitches signed by Graham . ”
Spokesman Kevin Bishop told Bloomberg : “ We have to pay it back , so we might as well ensure that we get our share of the money . ”
* Republican Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole called the stimulus a “ recipe for disaster ” last year ; today he ’s seeking “ funding for a grant to help develop an international trade center on a 2,700 - acre industrial park , a project he called ‘ a catalyst for the potential creation ’ of almost 30,000 jobs . ”

* Republican Texas Rep. Kay Granger sent out a statement on the anniversary of the stimulus calling the measure “ government waste at its worst . ”
Just months before , she signed her name to six grant proposals , including a toll - road project in the suburbs of Dallas and Fort Worth that she posited “ would create approximately 3,500 jobs in the local community , ” the wire service said .
* Republican Texas Rep. Pete Sessions dubbed the stimulus “ a massive spending binge by the Democrat - controlled Congress , ” only he requested money for four different projects — among them a proposal to add a Dallas streecar line .
Bloomberg notes the project got $ 23 million .
* Republican Florida Rep. John Mica said he applauded “ President Obama ’s recognition that high - speed rail should be part of America ’s future , ” shortly after the House passed the Democrats ’ stimulus bill — which he ’d just then voted against .
ADVERTISEMENT
* Republican Indiana Rep. Steve Buyer labeled the stimulus bill a “ sham ” last year , but fired off a personal missive to Obama ’s Transportation Secretary seeking $ 80 million for highway construction , which he called “ vital to the economic health of North Central Indiana . ”
In closing , Bloomberg notes that Buyer wrote : “ Ray , appreciate your personal attention .
Steve . ”
Democrats who voted against the stimulus and then sought stimulus money included Rep. Heath Shuler ( D - NC ) , Rep. Walt Minnick ( D - ID ) and Rep. Parker Griffith ( R - AL ) — a Democrat at the time who has since become a Republican .

But perhaps the best was Alaska Republican Rep. Don Young , who said the “ bill was not a stimulus bill .
It was a vehicle for pet projects , and that ’s wrong . ”
He promptly cheered his own success in getting a pet project into the bill , saying that he ’d “ won a victory for the Alaska Native contracting program and other Alaska small business owners last night in H.R. 1 , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act . ”

Oh , how it snowed .
It snowed like a bitch .
It snowed so hard you could be forgiven for thinking God had decided planet Earth was naught but an embarrassing celestial typo and was desperately trying to Tipp - Ex it out of existence .
The build - up was unrelenting : everywhere you looked a compacted strata of white powder looked back at you .
It was like being trapped in one of Shaun Ryder 's nostrils circa 1992 .
But colder .
Much colder .
It was so cold your breath hung in the air before you , then froze , plummeted and broke your foot .
And icy .
Did I mention it was icy ?
It was so icy that if you lived in a south - facing house in Edinburgh and slipped outside your front door , you 'd slide all the way to Plymouth and fly off the edge of Britain without passing a single frictional surface along the way .
Not that you 'd drown : the sea was frozen too , so you 'd simply carry on skidding , all the way around the entire circumference of the globe , eventually ending up back where you started .
Where you 'd find a news crew waiting to interview you .
You may think I 'm exaggerating .
So do I .
But I 've been watching the saturation news coverage of Britain 's cold snap and consequently it's hard not to view the snowfall through apocalyptic eyes .
The thick layer of snow received , quite literally , blanket coverage .
As far as the 24 - hour rolling networks were concerned , this was n't a freak weather condition .
This was war .
Death from the skies .
Earth versus the Ice Warriors .
Snowmageddon .
Actually , " Snowmageddon " would 've been a good name for it .
Every news crisis needs a snappy name .
The BBC initially christened it " Frozen Britain " .
Sky opted for " The Big Freeze " , and everyone else eventually fell into line .
The minute the government started issuing guidance about not making journeys unless strictly necessary , the reporters hit the road .
Every five minutes we had to go live to some poor sod standing outdoors in Benson or Brome or Bromsgrove or Birmingham , shivering like a man with a vibrator in his pocket , telling us how cold it was through his chattering teeth .
Not that you could actually see him : chances are he was obliterated by an alabaster flurry .
Presumably at some point the British climate had promised to behave and then unceremoniously reneged on the deal , because everyone kept referring to the weather as " treacherous " .
The phrase " treacherous conditions " was repeated like a mantra , like a catchy tune the news could n't shift .
Every witch - hunt has its victims , and before long the accusing finger pointed at roads and pavements : the reporters screamed that these too were " treacherous " , and presumably had been in cahoots with the weather all along .
Icy patches on pathways provided the news with chucklesome footage of people falling over and agitated soundbites in which aggrieved pratfallers complained about the lack of grit on pavements .
You can't please some people .
One minute they 're whining about the mollycoddling nanny state , the next they 're insisting the council employs a man to walk directly in front of them , shovelling grit beneath each potential footfall .
Not that there was grit to spare for the pavements .
The news was neurotic about dwindling grit .
When they were n't throwing live to a man with snow up to his balls they were linking to a woman in a Puffa jacket close to tears at a gritting depot .
Gritting depots do n't usually get this much prime - time TV exposure .
There 's never been a rough - and - tumble comedy drama starring Jimmy Nail set in a gritting depot , or a Live From the Gritting Depot variety hour .
Why ?
Because gritting depots are unbelievably fucking boring , a fact the news did its best to prove for several thousand hours .
At the time of writing , the Big Freeze began to thaw – or at least it did in the south , where the news is – and consequently fell off the running order .
Still , it was fun while it lasted .
But only if you prefer gazing into a snow globe to actually watching the news .

Brazil 's controversial plan to build the third - largest dam in the world right in Amazon rainforest got the go - ahead from the environmental ministry this week .
The ministers approved the permits for the dam project , and now companies can begin to bid on the building rights .
But whoever wins will have to pay out at least some money to protect the local environment .
Xingu River , has the additional trouble of being in one of the most important habitats in world and near to populations of indigenous peoples .
The Xingu is a tributary of the Amazon River .
In the announcement yesterday , environment minister Carlos Minc tried to reassure everyone that Belo Monte would not be an ecological disaster .
The 11,000 - megawatt Belo Monte dam is part of Brazil 's largest concerted development plan for the Amazon since the country 's military government cut highways through the rainforest to settle the vast region during its two - decade reign starting in 1964 [ Reuters ]
.
Nearly all huge dam projects raise environmental concerns because they flood vast areas and can change ecosystems so drastically .
But the Belo Monte , to be built on the
" Not a single Indian [ sic ] will be displaced .
They will be indirectly affected , but they will not have to leave indigenous lands , " he said [ The Guardian ]
.
But Brazilian officials say that about 12,000 people living in towns beyond the protected wild areas will be affected by the construction , and may have to be relocated .
Whatever company wins the bid to build the dam will have to pay in excess of $ 800 million to protect the environment and offset damage caused by the dam , and to resettle the displaced .
But Minc 's assurances did n't satisfy all the project 's critics , who
say diverting the flow of the Xingu river will still lead to devastation in a large area of the rainforest and damage fish stocks [ BBC News ]
.
They also contend that his pledge not to displace native populations is untrue , because the dam could flood nearly 200 square miles and affect 40,000 people there .
When completed , the dam could power the homes of 23 million people , the BBC reports .
And with Brazil 's population growing steadily , Belo Monte wo n't be the last dam project in the Amazon : 70 more are in the planning stages .

Over the past year the economy has shed millions of jobs .
Although job loss has slowed , the economy has yet to enter a period of net new job creation .
The trend in private employment appears particularly intractable .
Indeed , as Thomas Cooley and Peter Rupert put it , the labor market presents a dismal view by comparison with other indicators of economic activity , and not just because employment is a lagging indicator of recovery .
In their column Cooley and Rupert provide striking graphs showing total employment and the fraction of the population over 16 years of age who are employed .
Here is the graph comparing total employment in the last five recessions .
Here is the graph depicting the ratio of employment to population in the last five recessions .
Cooley and Rupert comment : “ Although job losses slowed in December , there is no evidence of recovery in employment .
This will be a continuing drag on the economy and on the fiscal condition of both state and federal governments . ”
In his most recent column , Cooley asks where job growth will come from .
Nor surprisingly , Cooley urges that “ policies designed to create new jobs in the economy should be directed at encouraging new firms . ”
I see no evidence that such policies will be forthcoming from the federal government in the next year .
On the contrary , among other things , the tax increases built into Obama ’s budget will discourage new firms .
Cooley appears to be a moderate man .
He is the Paganelli - Bull professor of economics and former dean of the NYU Stern School of Business .
Yet Cooley allows that the Obama administration has “ created some very large sources of uncertainty that impact small businesses and those who would finance them .
By pursuing a huge policy agenda without much success they have created large - scale uncertainty about health care costs , cap - and - trade policies , corporate taxes , taxes on incomes over $ 250,000 and estate taxes . ”
Will new jobs be formed on net with the scheduled tax increases and regulatory overhang ?
It is odd that so little serious attention has been devoted to the problem of job growth in the private sector except insofar as it can be used as an argument to enlarge the size and scope of the government itself .
Of all the bands experimenting with the Internet and its role in enriching their creativity and commerce , OK Go has become one of the canonical success stories , having produced two low - budget , immensely successful viral videos ( " A Million Ways " and " Here It Goes Again " in 2006 ) that together drew more than 50 million views and broadened their fan base considerably .
With their status as the de facto princes of the viral music video , imagine the fans ' surprise in seeing OK Go's new video branded with this handy instruction to anyone interested in spreading the word : " Embedding disabled by request . "
In a revealing rant detailing the modern woes of a band under the thumb of a major label , OK Go singer Damian Kulash writes :
And , voilá : four years after we posted our first homemade videos to YouTube and they spread across the globe faster than swine flu , making our bassist 's glasses recognizable to 70 - year - olds in Wichita and 5 - year - olds in Seoul and eventually turning a tidy little profit for EMI , we 're – unbelievably – stuck in the position of arguing with our own label about the merits of having our videos be easily shared .
It 's like the world has gone backwards .
In the letter , Kulash articulates a winding response to fans ' complaints about the inability to embed the OK
Go video on their own sites , as well as complaints from some international users who simply are n't allowed to view the video .
His explanation contains threads that should be familiar to anyone paying attention to the music industry and its contortionate attempts to cope with the Internet .
Labels are desperate for any opportunity to make money , and because they only make money when videos are viewed on YouTube ( and not when embedded elsewhere ) , OK Go's label is adamantly exerting controls to force users to view it on YouTube .
The flailing of stubborn major labels against anything associated with the Internet hurts plenty of regular people , but it 's particularly stinging to see them holding artists back -- the very people whose creativity they exist to support .
When Warner Music Group pulled the plug on their YouTube videos over a revenue spat , a significant body of Death Cab for Cutie 's videos hosted on the site and embedded elsewhere went dark as well -- collateral damage in Warner 's crusade for a bigger piece of the pie .
With drama like this , it 's no wonder that top artists like Trent Reznor , Radiohead , and other notables have made headlines for selling and distributing music sans label , and that the market for tools to help artists manage marketing and distribution independently ( Topspin or Bandcamp , for example ) is growing as well .
These shifts are just the most up - to - date notes in a dirge for major label - artist relations that 's been sung for years .
At the end of the letter , Kulash provides the embed code for video sharing from Vimeo , then closes on a bum note , resigned to the limitations imposed by EMI :
So , for now , here 's the bottom line : EMI wo n't let us let you embed our YouTube videos .
It 's a decision that bums us out .
We 've argued with them a lot about it , but we also understand why they 're doing it .
They 're aware that their rules make it harder for people to watch and share our videos , but , while our duty is to our music and our fans , theirs is to their shareholders , and they believe they 're doing the right thing .
So , the next time you see the music labels pressing for Internet - wide copyright filtering or three strikes laws in the name of protecting the artists , remember OK Go's reaction to their label 's methods : " It 's like the world has gone backwards . "
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel said on Sunday it wanted to include two Jewish shrines in the occupied West Bank in a national plan to rehabilitate some 150 Jewish and Zionist heritage sites , drawing condemnation from the Palestinians .
Slideshow ( 10 images )
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quoted in a statement as saying that Rachel ’s Tomb , near the city of Bethlehem , and the Tomb of the Patriarchs , a site holy to Muslims and Jews in the tinderbox city of Hebron , would be part of the plan .
“ Since I was asked , I would like to make my intentions clear , and this is what will be , ” Netanyahu said during a special cabinet meeting held in Tel Hai , a historical site in northern Israel where Jews and Arabs fought battles in 1920 .
Israeli media reported that the two disputed sites had been included in the plan only after pressure from nationalist ministers in Netanyahu ’s right - leaning coalition government .
The Fatah party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement that the decision was an attempt by Netanyahu ’s government to “ wreck international efforts aimed at returning to ( peace ) talks , ” which were suspended over a year ago .
Rachel ’s Tomb which is revered by Jews as the gravesite of the matriarch Rachel , is guarded by Israeli soldiers and surrounded by a fence .
Israeli security is also tight at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron , where a Jewish settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshippers in 1994 before being beaten to death at the scene .
Some 400 Jewish settlers live in heavily guarded enclaves in the city , which is also home to some 150,000 Palestinians .
“ This particular violation is especially dangerous because it will add to the religious component of the conflict in a way that might bring dangerous consequences , ” said Ghassan Khatib , a spokesman for the Palestinian government in Ramallah .
Also on Sunday , some 50 Jewish settlers and Israeli right - wing activists entered the Palestinian city of Jericho and barricaded themselves inside a synagogue .
An Israeli army spokesman said soldiers had evacuated the settlers .
It was unclear whether the Jericho synagogue was part of Netanyahu ’s restoration plan , which he said would cost some 400 million shekels ( $ 107 million ) .
Netanyahu , who last year ordered a limited 10 - month freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank , says he is ready to resume peace talks immediately and without preconditions .
Abbas says peace talks cannot resume without a full settlement freeze that includes East Jerusalem .
I was able to ( under the cover of dark ) get my hands on a early copy of Vandal Hearts : Flames of Judgment , and it did what it said it would : Flame my Judgment !
The plot of the story is so cliche that I am forced NOT to tell you any of it , because it would give away the “ ending ” … I would n’t suggest this game to a major fan of these types .
But that does n’t mean I would n’t suggest it to anyone who wants to start getting into the genre .
If you were around for the early days of the Playstation you may have , at one point , got your hands on a little game called Vandal Hearts .
If you did , then the mere mention of it should send you into a corner , trying to claw your way out .
For you kids out there who did n’t play it then I ’ll let you in on a secret .
Vandal Hearts was f - u - c - k - i - n -g hard !
It had no side - quests , no ability to level up on random battles , and the only money you got was from what you got in the story battles .
If you did n’t save up , or stretched yourself to far you went the way of J.J. Abrams : You LOST !
Vandal Hearts : FoJ on the oth …
…er hand decided to take anything looking like challenge and throw it out the window .
Ok , that ’s a bit harsh .
The game is challenging , if you put absolutely no attempt to try into it .
This is due to the way the game is set up on it leveling front .
the leveling system is not based on experience points , but on the Final Fantasy 2 kind of system where the more you do something the better you get at it .
Thus , if you hit guys with your sword alot , you get really , really good at hitting guys with your sword .
The same goes for bows , magic , etc .
What ’s the problem with that you ask ?
Well on my first playthough ( yes , my first , cuz some dick erased my save ) I discovered that I could go back to the first encounter after I had beaten it .
Endlessly .
Yes , at THIS specific point in the game it was really hard .
The fist real battle pits you against 4 wolves , whatever .
When you go back to the area , though you have to fight 12 .
A bit of a jump , yes , and I barely survived it .
( Hint : Wolves have to range , so if you go into a corner only so many can attack you at one time )
After that I was pleased with the difficulty of the ga …
… me .
Until , of course , I went back again and discovered that my survivor characters were about as O.P. as Demon Akuma .
I could n’t lose after that .
Ever .
In all subsequent story battles I was never in danger .
The game has in all only 6 characters , all of whom you get very early on in the game .
They are built to all be different classes :
Archer , paladin , mage , etc , but due to the skill use level up system they become more or less the same .
The only thing that really keeps them separate from each other is that they all have special powers that they use automatically if special conditions are met .
That sounds cool , but only 2 of them are of an real use .
One is used by the main character who , if killed , will be brought back to life once per battle .
Of course , I ’ve never actually SEEN it , as the situation has never come close to happening .
Partly due to the second useful power , which is used by the “ rogue ” character .
If he kills an enemy he may go into a frenzy which gives him a second turn to kill another enemy which may cause him to go into a frenzy which gives him a second turn to kill …. do you see what I ’m going at here ?
My personal record was 4 turns all of which were kill shots .
Thus , making him my favortie character , but NOT becuase I like him as a chara …
…cter .
The plot of the story is so cliche that I am forced NOT to tell you any of it , because it would give away the “ ending ” .
I never saw the ending , but I can almost guarantee you ’ve seen them before , despite the fact that the game supports a “ choice ” system that says that there are multiple endings depending on your choices through the game .
I sure hope so .
Let me give you a brief synopsis of the opening part of the game .
You find yourself at from what I can tell is “ War School ” , training with 3 other students under a wise teacher .
The student are You , a kid in glasses , a chick , and a bully .
Take a look at this picture and let me know which character you think is you , and which is the bully .
Yeah , you wonder which one is going to go bad sometime in the game about as much as you wonder which way your Ice Cream cone is going to melt .
The actual gameplay is n’t too bad .
You switch between short and long range weapons freely , without taking your whole turn to do it .
There are team attacks that happen randomly that allow you to do double damage to enemies , archers get buffs if they are on higher ground , and the magic you can use are worth the mp they cost to use .
Even the low level spells .
There are even sometimes map intractable items that you can use to tactically deal with enemies or obstacles .
Other hidden map zones can also be unlocked by exploring battle areas .
Unfortunately , that ’s about the only reasons to explore the maps since most search - able items give horrible items that you never use .
Chests are the only real exception , and even then ….* sigh * .
Character movement is also inherently flawed .
You move and then do something , but you ca n’t do something THEN move .
OH NO !
That would be too much to ask .
This is the only tactical game is seen that does this .
Trust me it is annoying .
You may have also noticed that this post was plagued with loading screens .
What a strange coincidence , so is Vandal Hearts : FoJ .
For a DLC game it has an odd amount of loading screens .
To go or do anything of real significance , you will go through no less than at least 3 loading screens .
Have fun with that !
Ok , I tore this game a new one , but despite all I said , It is n’t a bad game .
It just wont be that hard to veteran tactical players , and it has some gameplay issues .
I would n’t suggest this game to a major fan of these types of games .
But that does n’t mean I would n’t suggest it to anyone who wants to start getting into this genre of game .
As a beginners game , FoJ is a great stepping stone for new players .
Let you little brother play it , while you slam your head against the original Vandal Hearts .

BEIJING , Dec. 19 ( UPI ) --
China has started selling tickets for what it says will be the world 's fastest train , running an average speed of 217 mph .
The Wuhan - Guangzhou high - speed railway , which begins service Dec. 26 , will travel the route 's 664 miles in three hours , compared with more than 10 hours previous trains took , the news agency Xinhua reported Friday .

Tickets for the journey range from about $ 72 to $ 114 , close to the price of airline tickets , Xinhua said .
" The price for the Wuhan - Guangzhou line is reasonable , although it is a little bit higher than discounted flight price , " said a businessman who traveled between the cities frequently .
" The time of the rail journey is even shorter than by air , because I can avoid security checks as well as long trips between the airports and city centers . "
Officials expect a network of high - speed passenger rail lines covering most major cities in China to be operational by 2012 , Xinhua reported .
" We can only survive the competition by reducing costs and improving services , " said Si Xianmin , general manager of China Southern Airlines .

Adams does n't live in the

graduate entitles him to complain about a book that 's part of the school 's 11th - grade Advanced Placement English curriculum .
Adams has formally challenged the book ,
saying it contains objectionable material and advocates socialist ideas .
He claims the book promotes marijuana use and belittles Christians .
The 2001 book is a nonfiction account written by author

A committee of seven teachers and four administrators met in December to review Adams ' complaint and deemed the book appropriate for study at the school .

Harry Patch was the last surviving British World War I veteran .
Radiohead wrote a song about him earlier this year .
Harry Partch was an experimental music composer who worked with microtonal scales .
The Fiery Furnaces ' Matt Friedberger thought Radiohead wrote a song about him and got pissed about it ( " How 's the song ?
Is it 48 notes to the octave ? " he scoffed ) , igniting one of the more confusing ( and pretty dumb ) band beefs in recent memory .
Radiohead did not respond .
Friedberger tried to cover his fuck up with a statement that said : " Matt has not heard the Radiohead song about Harry Patch , but if he did , he is sure he would n't like it .
No doubt Radiohead and their fans can ignore his opinion of this matter and continue with their triumphant artistic interventions .
Matt would have much preferred to insult Beck but he is too afraid of Scientologists . "
Now , Beck seems to actually be responding .
He 's putting up a new song called " Harry Partch " on Beck.com later today .
According to a post on the site , the track " employs Partch 's 43 tone scale , which expands conventional tonality into a broader variation of frequencies and resonances . "
It is n't clear yet if the song is directly related to Friedberger 's remarks , or just one hell of a coincidence .
In other awesome Beck news , he 's currently honoring the 10th anniversary of the still - great Midnite Vultures album by posting all the videos from the record on his website , including the absolutely essential " Sexx Laws " clip , which is embedded below .
And he co-stars with Charlotte Gainsbourg in one of the best videos of the year , for their duet " Heaven Can Wait " , which we just posted .
A banner day for all things Beck .
We should have realized long ago that the State keeps existing only through the manufacturing of mass irresponsibility , and by our passive acceptance of our own irresponsibility and inability to solve our own problems .
That is why the message of Butler Shaffer about the irrelevance of the State to solve our problems is so appropriate and so powerful .
And it is only by recognizing this fact that we can erase the State from our horizon .
However , the essential condition for doing so is to become adult and mature human beings instead of remaining infantile and impotent state servants .
This is one of the best short texts on the State .
This quality derives from the fact that it goes straight to the core of the matter , right from the beginning .
The central aspect the author wants everybody to be aware of is that the State is an inane and dangerous illusion , totally irrelevant for the solution of any personal and social problem .
So , whoever looks for a political authority or searches for political blueprints in order to overcome the current ( and the future ) crises is a hopeless individual besides being an irresponsible human being ( an eternal minor ) .
I continue to receive responses from readers who cannot understand why I do not have a " what can we do ? " answer to the problems that beset not only America , but the entire world .
There is a sad , childlike quality to many of these e-mails , as though there is some authority figure - be it a politician or a writer - who can offer a magic solution to any difficulty .
When I suggest to them that there is nothing that anyone " in authority " can do to change any of this , and that the only change that can begin to correct our present course is to be found within their , their shattered confidence in me to offer yet " bold new program " turns to frustration and anger .
For so long we have abdicated our individual responsibility for the direction of our lives , that any suggestion that it is now timely to reclaim it meets with cries of contempt .
For those who have not yet gotten the message that our present condition is beyond institutional repair , and that civilization itself has run out of " solutions " to the problems it has created and is now in a State of collapse , you might wish to consider the warnings of a top CIA official .
In an address at Duke University over two weeks ago , CIA Deputy Director for Operations , James Pavitt , declared : " Now for the hard truth .
Despite the best efforts of so much of the world , the next terrorist attack - it ’s not a question of if , it ’s a question of when . "
Even though , today , his agency has " more spies stealing more secrets than at any time in the history of the CIA , " Pavitt noted that " with so many possible targets and an enemy more than willing to die , the perfect defense is n’t possible . "
To his credit , he added that increased counter - terrorism measures would require the sacrifice of so many liberties as to turn America into a system " not worth defending . "
Pavitt ’s words confirm one of the central theses of " chaos " theory : complex systems are too unpredictable to be controlled in furtherance of a given objective .
This is why the Soviet Union and other systems of pervasive State planning have either collapsed or are in a State of disrepair .
When this man declared " we in the government of the United States could ( sic ) neither prevent or precisely predict the devastating tragedy of the September 11th attacks " he was , whether knowingly or not , confirming the irrelevance of the State in a complex world .
There you have it , from someone at the top of the political food - chain : short of turning America into the kind of vicious police - State so familiar to KGB and SS operatives of the past , there is nothing that the most powerful nation - State in the history of the world can do to prevent more attacks such as occurred on September 11th .
Out of respect for this man ’s candor , please do not deluge him with e-mails berating his stance .
Take his words as yet another wakeup call to your own sense of responsibility .
You and I are the only persons who can bring about any fundamental changes in the butcherous madness that now besets our world .
And our only means of doing so requires you and me to go deep within our own thinking , in order to identify - and discard - the divisive , conflict - ridden , and destructive assumptions whose ancestral voices we continue to channel .
Each of us must learn to energize our minds , to give up our habits of passively recycling the lies that are told us - as well as the truths that are withheld - by institutional voices .
We must cease the practice of allowing others to formulate what should be our questions , heeding the warning of Andre Malraux : " [ A ] civilization can be defined at once by the basic questions it asks and by those it does not ask . "
We must also give up our eagerness for quick and easy answers - which any sharpie is well - equipped to provide - recalling the words of Milton Mayer : " The questions that can be answered are n’t worth asking . "
In short , each one of us must pursue what we most dread in this world : our own sense of responsibility .
The apparatus of the State has neither the capability nor the inclination to protect any of your interests .
To the contrary , you are expected to provide the means - including your very lives - in order to protect the State .
This is why wars have always increased the powers of political systems as they diminish individual liberties .
The State is as dependent upon wars as orthodontists are on overbites , or lawyers are on disputes .
While the ostensible enemy is always portrayed as faceless " others , " in reality every war is conducted by the State against its own citizenry .
If you doubt this , ask yourself these questions : whose liberties have been more greatly curtailed since September 11th , Osama bin Laden ’s or yours ?
Whose belongings are being searched at airports and other public buildings ; whose telephone , computer , credit card , medical , bank , and employment records are being monitored : Al Qaida operatives or yours ?
Whose taxes will be increased and whose children will be called upon to die in this eternal war : leaders of the Islamic Jihad or yours ?
If you have not already figured out the essential nature of the State , it is now time for you to do so .
Every political system is a racket , run by and for the benefit of the most disreputable people in any society , and employing those methods that , to any decent folk , represent the lowest qualities in human behavior .
Lying , threatening , coercing , killing , corrupting , deceiving , are such common characteristics in political life that we scarcely comment upon it anymore .
And yet , if your child grew up exhibiting such traits , you would rightfully regard yourself as a parental failure !
Government schools have conditioned us in the belief , long ago Stated by Thomas Hobbes , that without the direction and supervision of the State , our lives would be " nasty , brutish and short . "
We have been told that , while we are incapable of managing our own lives , we are capable of electing wise leaders to do this for us !
We have learned how to recite all of our socio-political catechisms with nary a glitch in meter .
We laugh at notions of " political correctness , " not realizing that the joke is on us : our minds have become little more than a mélange of contradictory beliefs and bromides about the necessity for the political domination of our lives .
How many among us , while chortling over some bureaucratic nonsense , are prepared to admit to the absurdity of all of politics ?
" The Emperor ’s New Clothes " is a story that every parent should not only read to his or her children , but should discuss with them its significance .
The " War on Terror " is the clearest expression of the failure of the State to foster a harmonious and orderly society .
Having a diminished appeal to the minds and souls of increasing numbers of people , the American State has had to resort to ubiquitous fear and violence in an effort to sustain its authority .
In so doing , it has revealed its own terrorist inclinations , the " dark side " of its character that it prefers to project onto others .
There are many otherwise intelligent people declaring that the attacks of September 11th were occasioned not by policies and practices of the United States government , but by some combination of " evil , " petulance , and cultural envy !
According to this view , some dozen and a half " terrorists " carefully plotted and carried out the destruction of the World Trade Center - knowing full well that they were going to be killed in the process - for no other reason than resentment of the fact that we have MTV and Calvin Klein jeans and women who can go out into public without being covered by a tent .
In the end , their sandbox syllogism comes down to nothing more than this : " we " are " good , " but " they " are " evil . "
These same babblers are quick to condemn any who would doubt the validity of the party line .
To suggest that these attacks were brought on by American government policies , they intone , is to justify them ; a proposition reflecting not only an intellectual bankruptcy , but their ignorance of Newton ’s " third law of motion . "
The men and women who died in the WTC collapse no more " deserved " to die than did those killed by an earthquake or tornado .
If one is to speak intelligently about such matters , he or she ought to have proper respect for distinctions between causation and justification .
But intellectual clarity is not what these apologists for statism have in mind .
I suspect that they are aware of the deeper implications these attacks have for the future of the State .
The order and liberty that most people have been conditioned to expect from hierarchically structured political systems has been called into grave doubt by a handful of men armed only with box -cutters .
Many of those who had been trained to believe that an all - powerful State could protect them from any threat , are now beginning to ask the sorts of questions left behind on government school playgrounds .
Having just completed a century that witnessed the State - caused deaths of some 200 million human beings in wars and genocidal practices ; and having become aware of how politicians have manipulated wars and other crises in order to advance State powers , many of us have been looking elsewhere for the peace , liberty , and order that is not to be found in political systems .
But to the statists , such inquiries are to be discouraged .
And so , we are witnessing a spate of attacks upon " libertarian " thinking of late - some of it even coming from those with pretensions of libertarian sentiments .
Those of us who understand that war has always been the greatest threat to liberty , have been accused of being " people who hate America , " " delusional , " " anti-American , " " naïve , " and " anti - free market , " by men and women with a more restricted sense of what it means to live freely .
One can only ponder the vision of humanity shared by those who can , simultaneously , support the marketplace as a regulator of our economic needs while embracing the war system that negates the value of human beings .
Do they believe that the collective exercise of deadly force is the essence of human values ?
Are missiles , invading armies , and F - 16 fighter - bombers what they conceive of as market forces ?
Shall this become the mantra of the incestuous marriage of political and economic systems - to be emblazoned on allegedly " libertarian " think - tank T - shirts - " General Electric : Love It or Leave It " ?
Perhaps the silliest attack on libertarianism came from the conservative Francis Fukuyama , a man whose earlier misprognosis of " the end of history " has not dissuaded him from offering this self - contradictory twaddle : after noting " the hostility of libertarians to big government , " he declared that
" Sept. 11 ended this line of argument .
It was a reminder to Americans of why government exists , and why it has to tax citizens and spend money to promote collective interests .
It was only the government , and not the market or individuals , that could be depended on to send firemen into buildings , or to fight terrorists , or to screen passengers at airports .
The terrorists were not attacking Americans as individuals , but symbols of American power like the World Trade Center and Pentagon . " [ emphasis added ]
One must accumulate the benefits of many doubts in Mr. Fukuyama ’s favor in endeavoring to explain this absurd paragraph .
Perhaps he was lacking in the study of both history and evolutionary biology when he declared , earlier , that human history had come to an end ; or perhaps , like so many others , his understanding of basic physics , chemistry , or engineering , gave him a diminished understanding of causality .
Then , again , perhaps his parents never read " The Emperor ’s New Clothes " to him when he was a child .
That he could fail to recognize that his own words confirm the libertarian critique of the State is remarkable .
" The terrorists were attacking . . . symbols of American power " on September 11th , and this is why the libertarian criticism of State power is flawed ?
Perhaps Mr. Fukuyama should read Mr. Pavitt ’s assessment not only of September 11th , but of the capacity of the State to prevent future attacks !
There is desperation in the voices of those statists who hope that , by declaring libertarian thinking dead , they will have a clear field for what is the core premise of their social thinking : the subjection of human beings to domination by the State .
They may have differing ideas as to how much leg chain to give to each of us - so that we may enjoy the illusions of liberty - but share that attribute so well observed by Hayek : " a fear of trusting uncontrolled social forces . "
In this outpouring of writings about the demise of libertarian thinking , one is reminded not only of Shakespeare ’s admonition about people who " protest too much , " but of Mark Twain ’s retort that reports of his death had been " greatly exaggerated . "
There is more wishful thinking than credibility in such assessments , not unlike that of the Elvis worshippers who would have us believe that he is really alive .
By any standard with which you judge the efficacy of any system , the State is irrelevant .
Neither your health , economic well - being , the education of your children , the protection of your life and property , are in any way facilitated by the State : to the contrary , such interests are threatened by political institutions .
In one of those last remaining functions that defenders of the State have clung to - i.e. , national defense - events of 9/11 have shown the utter uselessness of the State , a fact that finds confirmation in the remarks of this CIA official .
The State may not be able to survive in a world of instant global communication , decentralized decision - making , and computerized " virtual realities . "
If so , its demise will come about not through " terrorists " or violent revolutionaries , but out of a sense of boredom ; it will simply cease to entertain .
The statists understand this .
They know that , in a world of competing amusements , they must stage a Cecil B. DeMille extravaganza - a never - ending war against the entire world - if the boobs are to be induced to keep buying tickets .
While working on my uncle ’s farm as a child , I recall seeing him behead chickens .
The birds flapped and fluttered about , spattering blood wherever their dying bodies took them .
They made a mess of everything and a lot of noise , giving every appearance , to a young child , of purposeful behavior .
But the chickens ’ fates were sealed .
So too , I believe , is that of the State , which insists in going out with the same bloody fanfare as the chickens .
In this age of decentralizing systems , there remains only one State function of which free men and women would readily approve : to go out of business .
Its functions are no longer relevant to a complex and interrelated world .
Politicians , bureaucrats , police officers , judges , prison officials , tax collectors , one and all , would then be freed up from the burdens of " public service . "
They could then return to their homes there , in the words of Lysander Spooner , to " content themselves with the exercise of only such rights and powers as nature has given to them in common with the rest of mankind . "
( A Letter to Congressman Thomas Bayard , 1882 )
Not unlike previous years , 2009 was filled with celebrity slip ups , publicity stunts and political blunders ( however in the Obama era there have been less of these ) .
As we ring in 2010 , we take a look at the craziness in 2009 that made us shake our heads and wonder what they were thinking , or even if they were thinking at all .

Octomom
On January 26 , Nadya Suleman gave birth to only the second set of octuplets ever born in the United States .
This of course caught the media ’s eye , but when they found out that she had them through in vitro fertilization , that she had six other children and that she was looking after them with the help of public assistance programs , it turned into a media feeding frenzy .
She was dubbed octomom and turned all the media attention she was getting into several television appearances , including Oprah , where both she and her doctor have been heavily scrutinized .
With the media attention fleeting she signed on with European production company Eyeworks to film a reality show that will follow the growth of the octuplets and will be aired in England .

Chris Brown and Rhianna
On February 7 , the night of the Grammy Awards , Chris Brown hit Rhianna after they had argued over a text he had gotten from another woman .
No Matter who you are or what happens , violence is never the answer .
When the police arrived , they found her with a split lip , bite marks on her hand and contusions on either side of her forehead .
Chris was arrested and charged with felony battery and making criminal threats , however , a plea bargain was reached and he only had to spend 180 days in a labor domestic violence program instead of being sent to jail .
What makes it even worse is that Rhianna seems not to care what he did to her and they have been seen together several times since , and she even protested to a strict stay - away order that was part of Chris ’ plea bargain .

Joaquin Phoenix ’ Letterman Interview
A definite contender for the most bizarre interview ever happened on February 10 when Joaquin Phoenix appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman .
First of all he came out looking like he had been marooned on a deserted island for the past few years , think Tom Hanks in Castaway .
He then proceeded to say no more than one or two sentences to any question Letterman threw at him and seemed like he was n’t all there .
He could n’t even set up the clip he had brought with him .
I was actually watching that night and it was like a train wreck , you know , so bad that you did n’t want to watch but you could n’t turn away .

Jon and Kate
Ok , first of all why is this one of the biggest stories of the year , everywhere you went this year it was Jon did this and Kate said that , enough already people .
In February evidence came out that Jon had been cheating on Kate and the media felt like everybody had to know about it .
In the months that followed , the couple and their eight children graced the front page of every tabloid in the country and Kate hit the talk show circuit to sell herself as the wronged wife and let the world know that everything they were doing was for the good of their kids .
If that were really true , they would n’t have sold the TV rights to their childhood and dragged them through a messy public divorce .

Jamie Foxx vs. Miley Cyrus
At an April 11th taping of his Sirius radio show , The Foxxhole , Jamie Foxx made several inappropriate comments while criticizing Miley about not being able to meet Radiohead at the Grammy Awards .
When someone on the show brought up the teen star , he asked “ Who is Miley Cyrus ?
The one with all the gums ? ”
He then told her to “ make a sex tape and grow up .
Get like Britney Spears and do some heroin .
Do like Lindsay Lohan and get some crack in your pipe …
Catch chlamydia on a bicycle seat . ”
And this is from the father of a teenage daughter .
Foxx later apologized to her on Leno saying that he is “ a comedian and you guys know that whatever I say , I do n’t mean any of it .
And sometimes , as comedians , as we do , we go a little bit too far . ”

Susan Boyle
Also on April 11th in Britain , an unlikely star was born .
On an episode of Britain ’s Got Talent , Scottish born Susan Boyle blew the audience and judges away with her rendition of “ I Dreamed a Dream ” from Les Miserables .
Within days she was a world wide sensation known as much for her frumpy appearance as for her angelic voice .
Despite earning the most votes in the semi-finals , she finished in second place to Diversity , a street dance group .
After the final she was admitted to The Priory ( a psychiatric clinic in London ) where she was treated for exhaustion .
After the Britain ’s Got Talent tour , she began work on her debut album “ I Dreamed a Dream ” which was released in November .

Obama Kills a Fly
On June 17 during an interview with CNBC President Obama killed a fly that had been buzzing him .
He had shooed it away but when it landed on his arm he smacked it , he then said “ That was pretty impressive , was n’t it ?
I got the sucker . ” PETA fired back calling the incident and “ execution ” and stating on the group ’s blog “ In a nutshell our position is this :
He is n’t the Buddha , he ’s a human being , and human beings have a long way to go before they think before they act . ”
They also sent him a device that traps flies so they can be released outside .
I want to know how this qualifies as news ?
Most people have killed flies in our lifetime , including , I ’m assuming other presidents so why does it matter if Obama did it .
All I can come up with is that it must have been a slow news day .

Black Eyed Peas vs. Perez Hilton
This is just a bunch of people fighting like they are in kindergarten .
At a club in Toronto after the Much Music Video Awards on June 21 , will .i.am of the Black Eyed Peas confronted celeb blogger Perez Hilton about comments he had made about band - mate Fergie , which escalated into an argument where Hilton ( who is gay himself ) decides to call him a “ faggot ” of all things .
It got really ugly when band manager Polo Molina joined in and threw a few punches at Hilton .
But instead of just calling the police like a normal person , Perez begged his fans to call them via Twitter … from his cell phone !
The next day will .i.am posted a video telling his side of the story and Hilton could n’t help but post his own video in retaliation .
Molina turned himself in and was arrested for assault , but the charges were eventually dropped .

The Death of a Legend
On June 25 , the world lost one of the greatest performers of all time .
But what shocked all of us was that we initially had no idea how it could have happened … he was gearing up to go on tour and everything .
There were rumors swirling over what really killed the King of Pop until the LA County Coroner made his official statement on August 28 , ruling his death a homicide .
The autopsy report showed that he was a perfectly healthy 50 year old but that he had been taking several medications including alprazolam , sertraline , omeprazole , hydrocodone , paroxetine , carisprodol and hyrdomorphone , as well as one that really troubled doctors , propofol which is used as an anesthetic for surgery patients .
It was most likely the combination of these drugs that killed him .
This conclusion has fueled outrage toward the several doctors involved and those in his entourage .
Members of the Jackson family , La Toya especially , has been very vocal about charging anyone found at fault for Michael ’s death .
Specific chemical modifications to proteins called histones , which are found in the nucleus of cells and act as spools around which DNA is wound , can be used to predict prognosis and response to treatment in subsets patients with pancreatic cancer , a study by researchers at UCLA 's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center has found .
High levels of two specific histone modifications in tumor cells of patients who underwent surgical resection of their pancreatic cancer predicted those patients more likely to derive survival benefit from the commonly used chemotherapy drug Fluorouracil , or 5 - FU .
Along with Gemcitabine , 5 - FU is a common chemotherapy used to treat patients with pancreatic cancer , the fourth deadliest cancer in the United States .
" These histone modifications were useful in predicting whether or not a patient was likely to respond favorably to 5 - FU " said Dr. David Dawson , an assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine , senior author of the study and a Jonsson Cancer Center researcher .
" Using a specially devised test and algorithm , we were able to discriminate two groups of pancreatic cancer patients who were more or less likely to have longer disease - free remissions and overall survival . "
The histone modifications themselves also may prove to be future targets for drug therapies , Dawson said .
The study , which needs to be validated in a prospective study , was published this week in the peer - reviewed Journal of Clinical Oncology .
Jonsson Cancer Center researchers , led by Dr. Siavash Kurdistani and Dr. David Seligson , developed and patented the immunohistochemistry assay , or antibody test , to measure the levels of the specific histone modifications within cells .
The rights to that technology have been licensed by an outside company .
Kurdistani and Seligson , also authors on the study , previously used the test to identify the same histone modifications in subsets of patients with prostate , kidney and lung cancers .
They showed that low cellular levels of the histones could determine which prostate cancer patients were more likely to suffer a recurrence and which patients with lung and kidney cancers would experience poorer survival rates .
The current study centered on a field known as epigenetics , which focuses on inherited information other than that directly encoded by DNA .
In addition to genetic mutations , epigenetic changes such as alterations to histone modifications contribute to the development of cancer , said Kurdistani , an assistant professor of biological chemistry .
" Overall , these histone modifications are providing useful information as to how a cancer may behave , " he said .
" In addition , there may be a direct causal link between these changes and tumor aggressiveness . "
The tissues used in the study came from a 195 - patient cohort enrolled in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9704 trial , a multi-center , phase III study of pancreatic cancer comparing adjuvant Gemcitabine with 5 - FU , and a separate , 140 - patient cohort of patients with stage I or II pancreatic cancer from UCLA .
Generally , low levels of histone modifications were found to be predictors of poor survival in both patient cohorts , and to identify those less likely to respond to 5 - FU in the 9704 patient cohort , the study reports .
" Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive and lethal cancer for which there are limited therapeutic options , " the study states .
" Along with genetic events , tumor - associated epigenetic alterations are important determinants in the initiation and progress of pancreatic cancer and represent promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets . "
It may take three to five years to develop a commercially available test that could be used on prostate , kidney , lung and pancreatic cancer patients , Kurdistani said .
Next , Kurdistani and Dawson will be pursuing studies in cell lines and animal models to determine what if any role the histone modifications have in causing the development of aggressive forms of pancreatic cancer .
" If you can uncover the mechanism of how the histone modifications are associated with cancer development and / or progression , you may be able to design strategies to interfere with that process , " Kurdistani said .
" Such a strategy could be the basis for a targeted therapy or chemoprevention approach . "
Kurdistani said the current study could not have been done if not for the collaborative and multi-disciplinary research within the Jonsson Cancer Center and UCLA .
The study was funded through grants from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Translational Research Program , the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine and the Hirshberg Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research .

Diabetes disrupts blood sugar levels Intense treatment to lower blood sugar in patients with diabetes could prove nearly as harmful as allowing glucose levels to remain high , a study says .
Cardiff researchers looked at nearly 50,000 patients with type 2 diabetes and found the lowest glucose levels linked to a heightened risk of death .
Significant differences in death rates between patients on insulin and those taking tablets are also flagged up .
But there could be various explanations for this , experts noted .
Patients taking insulin - based treatments have been urged not to stop taking their medication as a result of the Cardiff University study , which is published in The Lancet .
Changing treatments
Using data from GPs , the team identified 27,965 patients aged 50 and above with type 2 diabetes whose treatment had been intensified to include two oral blood glucose lowering agents - metformin and sulphonylurea .
It is crucial to remember that blood glucose targets should always be agreed by the person with diabetes and their healthcare team according to individual needs and not according to a blanket set of rules
Dr Iain Frame
Diabetes UK
A further 20,005 patients who had been moved on to treatment which included insulin were added to the study .
Patients whose HbA1c levels - the proportion of red blood cells with glucose attached to them - were around 7.5 % , ran the lowest risk of dying from any cause .
For both groups this risk went up by more than half if levels dropped to 6.4 % , the lowest levels recorded .
For those with the highest levels the risk of death increased by nearly 80 % .
But the risks appeared to be particularly pronounced among those on the insulin - based regimen than those on the combined treatment .
Irrespective of whether their HbA1c levels were low or high , there were 2,834 deaths in the insulin - taking group between 1986 and 2008 , nearly 50 % more than in the combined group .
' Do n't stop '
The authors acknowledged there could be various factors associated with this , such as these being older patients with more health problems , who perhaps had had diabetes for a longer period of time .
They also make reference to a possible link between use of insulin and cancer progression that had been reported in a different study .
" Whether intensification of glucose control with insulin therapy alone further heightens risk of death in patients with diabetes needs further investigation and assessment of the overall risk balance , " wrote lead author Dr Craig Currie .
" Low and high mean HbA1c values were associated with increased all - cause mortality and cardiac events .
If confirmed , diabetes guidelines might need revision to include a minimum HbA1c value . "
These findings were in line with those of a major ongoing trial in the US , which pulled patients off a regimen of intensive blood sugar management after noting an unexpected increase in total deaths among this arm of its study .
Dr Iain Frame , head of research at Diabetes UK , described this latest study as " potentially important " but stressed it had limitations .
" It is not clear what the causes of death were from the results reported .
Furthermore , when it comes to the suggestion made in this research that insulin could increase the risk of death , we must consider important factors such as age , the duration of their diabetes and how the participants managed their condition . "
While people would be able to manage their condition for a period with diet , exercise and even tablets , many would eventually have to move on to insulin , he noted .
" We would advise people with type 2 diabetes who use insulin not to stop taking their medication .
However , if they are worried about blood glucose targets , they should discuss this with their healthcare team . "

( CNN ) --
The assistant coach of Togo 's national soccer team is among the victims of Friday 's machine - gun attack on a bus carrying the squad to a tournament in Angola , the country 's official news agency reported Saturday .
As many as three people were killed and nine injured in the strike , which prompted the team to decide Saturday to pull out of the Africa Cup of Nations tourney .
Angola 's official ANGOP news agency reported that assistant coach Hamelet Abulo and a Togolese journalist died Saturday .
There were conflicting reports about the driver of the bus .
Fraser Lamond -- regional medical director of SOS International , a group that transports injured people to hospitals -- said the driver was among the dead , but Togo government officials indicated he was still alive .
Lamond said a third wounded person was being evacuated to Johannesburg , South Africa , for treatment .
ANGOP reported that goalkeeper Kodjovi Kadja , was sent to South Africa for an injury to his back .
It was unclear whether Lamond and ANGOP were referring to the same person .
The team was headed to Angola for the tournament when it was attacked near the border between Angola and the Republic of Congo .
An armed wing of a separatist group -- the Forces for Liberation of the State of Cabinda ( FLEC ) -- has claimed responsibility for the attack and has threatened to strike again .
CNN cannot independently verify the claim .
Emmanuel Adebayor , the Togo team 's captain and a star for England 's Manchester City team , said he and his teammates met Saturday morning " before deciding that they wished to pull out of the tournament , " the Manchester City Football Club Web site said .
He was not injured in the attack , Manchester City said .
" It 's as if we 've gone to war , " said goalkeeper Kossi Agassa .
" It 's deplorable for Africa .
I do n't know what other countries will decide , but it 's hard .
Too hard for us footballers . "
Angolan officials -- trying to assuage security fears that could dampen the war - torn nation 's sporting aspirations -- vowed to heighten security , particularly in Cabinda , a disputed oil - rich enclave located within the Democratic Republic of Congo and the site of eight matches in the tournament .
Togo had been scheduled to play Ghana on Monday in Cabinda .
" We vehemently condemn the ignoble action , lament the loss of lives , and we reiterate our commitment to guarantee security so that the CAN ORANGE 2010 ( tournament ) will firm itself as a great sporting event and a manifestation of friendship and solidarity among the African people , " an Angolan government statement said .
Arriving Saturday with a high - level delegation to Cabinda , Angola 's Prime Minister Antonio Paulo Cassoma insisted his government provided proper security .
" Security was guaranteed .
Nevertheless ... we will provide more security and protection to the delegations , " Cassoma told Angola 's TPA Television .
Leaders of the Confederation of African Football were expected to meet Saturday with Cassoma " to take decisions to guarantee the smooth running of the competition , " a statement on that organization 's Web site said .
Host nation Angola is scheduled to kick off the tournament against Mali on Sunday in Luanda .
The tournament -- one of the world 's biggest -- is Angola 's first major sporting event since a 2002 peace deal brought the southern African country 's decades - old civil war to an end .
It also marks the beginning of a year in the spotlight for African football , with South Africa set to become the continent 's first country to host the FIFA World Cup in June .
The Angola tournament has been eagerly anticipated as an early chance to assess the form of African powerhouses such as Drogba and Toure 's Ivory Coast , Essien 's Ghana and Eto'o 's Cameroon ahead of the World Cup .
Football world government body FIFA said it was " deeply moved " by the incident and expressed " utmost sympathy " with the Togolese players .
It said it expected a full report from the CAF on the situation .
Togo striker Thomas Dossevi , who plays for French team Nantes , told CNN " armed rebels " with AK - 47s had opened fire .
" We were attacked by armed rebels who used Kalashnikovs .
We had just passed the border and a couple of minutes later we were attacked from both sides .
" We hid below the seats -- we had police protection in front and behind but we were attacked from both sides .
As soon as I heard the bullets I went to the floor .
...
The attack lasted for 10 - 15 minutes , " Dossevi said .
Cabinda is located within the Democratic Republic of Congo .
A strip of that nation separates it from Angola , one of the world 's largest energy producers and a major supplier of petroleum and liquefied natural gas to the U.S. market .
Angola , which was wracked by civil war for nearly three decades , brokered a peace deal in 2006 with separatists seeking an independent republic of Cabinda .
Togo is a strip of a nation that averages about 60 miles wide , nestled between Benin and Ghana in West Africa .
It is smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia .
The G - spot ' is a fantasy ' :
That elusive erogenous zone does n't exist , say researchers
You can call off the search , chaps – the G - spot may not exist after all .
Researchers who studied 1,800 women have found no evidence of the female erogenous zone .
They believe that it may be a figment of women 's imagination , encouraged by magazines and sex therapists .
They add that the ' myth ' has made many men and women feel inadequate about their sex lives .
Subjective : British scientists claim the G - spot may not exist at all
The G - spot is supposed to be a small area of the female body where nerve endings are concentrated .
If activated by a sexual partner , it is supposed to give supreme sexual pleasure .
Sex therapists have made careers out of telling women they can boost their G - spot through diet or exercise .
But the study of British women at King 's College London has cast doubt on the science behind it .
Co-author Tim Spector , professor of genetic epidemiology , said : ' Women may argue that having a G - spot is due to diet or exercise , but in fact it is virtually impossible to find real traits .
' This is by far the biggest study ever carried out and it shows fairly conclusively that the idea of a G - spot is subjective . '
Andrea Burri , the other author , said she was concerned that women who feared they lacked a G - spot were suffering from feelings of ' inadequacy or underachievement ' .
She said : ' It is rather irresponsible to claim the existence of an entity that has never been proven and pressurise women – and men too . '
In the study , 1,804 women aged between 23 and 83 filled in questionnaires .
All were pairs of identical or non-identical twins .
If a G - spot did exist , it would be expected that both identical twins , who have the same genes , would report having one .
But in cases where one twin reported having the zone , the scientists found that no pattern emerged of the other one having it .
In fact , identical twins were no more likely to share a G - spot than non-identical twins , who only share half their genes .
Some 56 per cent of women said they had a G - spot , but they tended to be younger and more sexually active .
Gedis Grudzinskas , consultant gynaecologist at London Bridge Hospital , said : ' I think this study proves the difference between popular science and biological or anatomical science . '
Popularised :
The location of the purported G Spot , which became well known in the 1980s
The idea of the G - spot was popularised by sexologist Professor Beverly Whipple of Rutgers University in New Jersey in 1981 .
It was named in honour of German gynaecologist Ernst Grafenberg who claimed to have discovered the erogenous zone in 1950 .
Professor Whipple says she found G - spots in a study of 400 women , and described the new British study as ' flawed ' .
She said it did not look at lesbians and failed to take into account the prowess of different men .
She said : ' The biggest problem with the findings is that twins do n't generally have the same sexual partner . '
The British study will be published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine this week .

Two interesting bits of news :
First , a new poll shows that only 6 % of Americans think the stimulus bill created any jobs .
Second , two non-partisan , well - regarded economic research firms report that the economic stimulus bill passed by Congress has created between 1.6 and 1.8 million jobs and has definitely helped get the economy moving in the right direction .
And you do n’t have to be an economist to see that the stimulus bill created lots of jobs — the evidence is simply everywhere .
State governments were able to keep teachers , firefighters , and other jobs that would have been lost without the stimulus .
Corporate spending also surged because of a tax credit for corporate investment that was part of the stimulus bill .
And it increased consumer spending by at least $ 100 billion .
I posted this graph over a week ago , but it deserves repeating :
The question is , why do so few Americans think the stimulus bill helped ?
Hmmm , could it be because a Republican PR campaign against the stimulus bill ?
Like here , where Scott Brown , the new Republican senator from Mass. , says that the stimulus bill “ did n’t create one new job “ ?
Non-partisan PolitiFact rated that line a “ pants on fire ” lie .
Or maybe like here , an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal ( now owned by the same company as Fox News ) with the headline “ The Stimulus Did n’t Work ” .
Ironically , two of the authors of this article work for The Hoover Institution , named for the Republican president that famously presided over the start of the Great Depression ( mirroring Dubya ’s role in the current economic mess ) and whose economic policies are frighteningly similar to those of the current Republican party .
Or could it be the tea partiers , constantly screaming against any spending from Obama , but who were curiously silent when Dubya spent even larger amounts of money on two wars and an unfunded Medicare giveaway to the drug companies .
The media gives tons of coverage to Tea Party events , but when was the last time they honestly discussed the economy and how it is improving ?
Still think there is a “ liberal media ” in this country ?

Since the last Jason Bourne movie was released , everyone has wondered when another sequel would be made .
With the huge worldwide box office grosses and critical success , you ’d think it would be easy to get another sequel off the ground .
But time and again , Matt Damon has said they ’d only do another sequel if the script was good .
Add to that , director Paul Greengrass recently said he was n’t going to do another Bourne sequel .
So when I sat down at today ’s press junket for Green Zone and was able to participate in small roundtable interviews with the star and director , the one thing I really wanted to know was what exactly was up with another Bourne sequel .
Thankfully , I was able to ask both of them that question .
Unfortunately for fans of the Bourne franchise , it ’s very bad news .
First off , Greengrass told me he ’s definitely not making another Jason Bourne movie .
And on top of that , Damon told me he would never make another Bourne movie without Greengrass .
So … that ’s it .
The nail is in the coffin .
I hope you enjoyed the three Bourne movies cause it ’s over .
Or is it ?
Hit the jump for more :
While Damon said he was done with Bourne , he did tell me an idea for more Bourne movies without him in it .
Here ’s what he said :
Collider :
So does that mean there ’s no more Bourne ?
Damon :
Well , I think that they have a good way to do a prequel with someone else , and basically make it about the Bourne identity , the actual identity .
What any studio is interested in is making it like an evergreen , so it can just go on , and on , and on , and it never will with our character because he ’s going to resolve himself and he ’s resolved his issues now .
He ’s got his memory back three times .
I do n’t think anybody wants to see me say , “ I do n’t remember ” again .
But I think what we could do , is like , you know , so you can do some movies with another actor , anyway , whether it ’s Ryan Gosling or Russell Crowe or Denzel Washington , and he ’s Jason Bourne .
And then at the end of his one movie , or two movies , or three movies , you see them getting ready to pass the identity on to me , so it just becomes like a 007 , it becomes a name that they give this certain person who ’s uniquely positioned .
Right ?
And so then , if Paul and I come back and do a fourth one in 10 years , right , we ’ll pass it on to someone else , and then it can kind of go on .
But I think the only way to make it go away from us is to say no .
I guess he ’s trying to say Universal might make more Bourne movies with another actor playing a Bourne type character .
While that might be cool , one of the reasons people love the franchise is Matt Damon playing the role .
Who knows if another actor playing that kind of part would even work .
On a positive note , Damnon revealed that he ’s been talking to Greengrass about doing another film together and it ’s about the economic meltdown .
While it ’s not another Bourne film , I welcome with open arms any future collaboration .
Here ’s exactly what they both said on the Bourne franchise .
I wish it was better news .
MATT DAMON ON BOURNE
Collider : I ’m going to ask the question , I ’ve asked you this a few times in the past , about Bourne .
We spoke to Paul today , and he was like , “ I ’m out .
You know , it ’s done . ”
So the question then becomes , are you willing to make a Bourne movie without Paul .
Matt Damon : No .
Collider :
So does that mean there ’s no more Bourne ?
Damon :
Well , I think that they have a good way to do a prequel with someone else , and basically make it about the Bourne identity , the actual identity .
What any studio is interested in is making it like an evergreen , so it can just go on , and on , and on , and it never will with our character because he ’s going to resolve himself and he ’s resolved his issues now .
He ’s got his memory back three times .
I do n’t think anybody wants to see me say , “ I do n’t remember ” again .
But I think what we could do , is like , you know , so you can do some movies with another actor , anyway , whether it ’s Ryan Gosling or Russell Crowe or Denzel Washington , and he ’s Jason Bourne .
And then at the end of his one movie , or two movies , or three movies , you see them getting ready to pass the identity on to me , so it just becomes like a 007 , it becomes a name that they give this certain person who ’s uniquely positioned .
Right ?
And so then , if Paul and I come back and do a fourth one in 10 years , right , we ’ll pass it on to someone else , and then it can kind of go on .
But I think the only way to make it go away from us is to say no .
Collider :
So what would be the title then , I mean , with James Bond it ’s James Bond , 007 .
How would it be in the title what they are thinking about going with ?
Damon : I do n’t know .
I have no idea .
Collider : The Bourne Infancy
Damon : Yeah , it ’s like a Look Who ’s Talking .
Collider : You and Paul have a phenomenal working relationship , how much , when you guys talk about other things , how much do you want to continue in the vein you have been going in , or possibly just go and branch into a whole new direction with his style ?
Damon :
Well , I think , what we have been talking about is something , maybe a movie , about the economic meltdown , and trying to figure out what the way in is .
But yeah , I love making these movies with him , and they give us … and we ’re making them for pretty good budget so we can kind of tell it on a bigger scale .
This is a big movie , you got helicopters blowing up and it ’s like a big deal .
So hopefully we ’ll be able to keep making big stories , but I ’ll kind of go anywhere he wants to go .
I think he ’s a great director and I learn a ton , every time I work with him , about directing and about acting .
So I ’ll follow him pretty much anywhere .
PAUL GREENGRASS ON BOURNE
Collider : I ’m going to ask the question that every fan out there of the Bourne franchise wants to know .
Are you definitely not doing another one ?
Can you give people the status what ’s up with that .
Paul Greengrass :
What happened was that I just felt , listen , I love the Bourne franchise , number one , a great deal , and I gave my all on the two films that I made .
But when I was honest with myself , in the last autumn , and I was starting to get going on other things , you just ca n’t top once you ’ve realized you ’ve done it .
You do n’t have anything more to contribute to the franchise that needs to continue , obviously .
And in order for a franchise to continue it needs to be rebooted and reenergized by new perspectives .
I just felt that I had done it , and there ’s nothing unnatural about that .
To make a film , it ’s 18 months of your life , seven days a week , 20 hours a day , you got to have real , real … and there was just too many other things I was interested in .
I felt I had a wonderful , wonderful time , loved it , and I want it to continue .
So , in the end , contrary to reports , there was never an argument with the studio of any kind at all .
I was , I did spend some time thinking that I might , and sort of getting myself to a place , you know , “ what would it be , ” and that was really it .
It ’s only when you do that that you actually find , “ you know what ?
I ’m sort of gone .
I ’m on top of things . ”
We had a really nice discussion , they were completely understanding , and I said , “ you know what ?
We ’ll make some other movies . ”
Collider :
So this is it .
We can put a nail in the coffin , this is official , you are definitely not doing another one .
Greengrass : I ’m doing some other things .
Collider :
Which is the follow - up .
What are you thinking about for other projects ?
Greengrass : ‘ Dunno .
Have n’t gotten anything definite yet , but I ’m enjoying reviving , you know , doing some … those four films …
Question :
What was it ?
Like eight years ?
Greengrass : Yeah , I mean it ’s , Supremacy …actually six …Supremacy , what are we now ?
2010 .
Greengrass : Supremacy , 93 , Ultimatum , Green Zone .
I think this is also part of my sort of feeling , although I did n’t realize it then , but you sort of sit down and go , “ Actually , it ’s like the end of a chapter . ”
They ’re all four films that are really about this decade and they ’re all sort of interlinked in a funny kind of way , even though some of them are quite different from the others .
They are all really sort of about those years , and that world , and that sort of a film , the big , high - octane , action movie type of thing , so I just thought I need to find some new tricks for this old dog .
Well , not so old .
So you kind of go , actually , I need to do some different things , engage in some new material .
I ’d like to do something that ’s a bit more with boys and girls , and men and women .
Love .
Romantic comedy .
Greengrass :
You never know .
A family film … you know , listen , I ’ll still make , I want to do …
Matt and I want to do some things , continue our partnership .
We ’ll certainly be doing that .
You know , it ’s just time to move on .
That ’s what happens .
Listen , you be the first to say if I came back and did a bad one , you ’d go , “ they should have found somebody else .

The public option is dead this morning .
And this time , it is n't coming back to life .
The Senate is n't going to include any version of the idea in its bill .
And while the House can still demand a public option in conference , nobody I know expects the House to prevail .
The primary causes of death were the fierce opposition of special interests and the institutional habits of the United States Senate , in which a clear majority of senators representing an even clearer majority of the people lack the power to pass a bill .
The time of death ?
Somewhere around 6:30 p.m. last night , during a meeting of the Democratic caucus , in which Majority Leader Harry Reid announced that the votes for a public option just were n't there -- and that passing a health care reform bill , as quickly as possible , was too important to risk further debate and delay .
After the meeting , even stalwart public option defenders like Sherrod Brown and Jay Rockefeller signaled their grudging agreement .
And that 's because they knew Reid was right .
The Majority Leader had spent most of the last month trying to round up the votes for a public option and , when the votes were n't there , he put negotiators in a room to come up with an acceptable compromise .
They did , only it still was n't acceptable enough for Senator Joe Lieberman .
And without Lieberman , the Democrats could n't move forward , at least not without great risk to the broader project .
At the end of the day , Brown and Rockefeller and their allies simply care too much about people struggling with their medical bills -- people who would still benefit , clearly , from reform without a public option -- to mount further resistance .
Lieberman , by all appearances , felt no compunction to put people over pique .
That 's why he won .
Disappointed progressives may be wondering whether their efforts were a waste .
They most decidedly were not .
The campaign for the public option pushed the entire debate to the left -- and , to use a military metaphor , it diverted enemy fire away from the rest of the bill .
If Lieberman and his allies did n't have the public option to attack , they would have tried to gut the subsidies , the exchanges , or some other key element .
They would have hacked away at the bill , until it left more people uninsured and more people under-insured .
The public option is the reason that did n't happen .
And if public option supporters lost in the Congress , they won in the country as a whole .
The underlying political problem for liberals remains what it has been for a generation : profound and widespread distrust of government .
But polls consistently showed voters thought the public option advocates were right -- that , at least when it comes to health insurance , government can be trusted .
It was a small victory , but it's on top of such small victories that political movements are built .
Someday in the future , that movement may be powerful enough to win more sweeping changes .
Who knows , maybe those changes will include a government - run insurance plan .
With the client requested of a ‘ cloud - like ’ impression form the new interior .
The architects have focused on the ceiling to get new looks and reorganize existing space since the existing structure from seventies was extraordinary .
In many ways the building is particular but above all for its synthesis between architectural and structural reasoning .
The main volume of the building , triangular in plan , is elevated some fifteen meters above the river and the ground level with the pedestrian esplanade .
It is supported solely by the central core which contains two elevator shafts and double spiral staircase .
Cantilevers are reaching out some twelve meters giving a levitating feel to the building .
In addition one more structural move is crucial for seamless interaction between exterior and interior of the building .
Concrete floor - slab and ceiling shell are not connected at the perimeter of the building , allowing for the continuity of the glass façade to the full extent .
Uninterrupted glass strip , with the total length of 150 meters , is wrapping around the building to give constant presence of the Danube River in the interior , with sweeping views reaching far out , both upstream and downstream .
Defining moment of the new spatial expression is the ceiling .
Its design is the sequence of geometric transformations and subdivision applied to the original grid .
As a result , approximately 390 backlit panels with the finite variation in shape and size are suspended from the triangular steel construction .
The idea was to create light and spacious space so that visitors should be getting an impression of entering a cloud on arrival .
In response 4of7 have opted for reflective resin floor finishes throughout and semi translucent ceiling ; both aiming to expose sleek forms of Technogym training equipment in the open plan arrangement.via 4of7
Since signing up for Mike Adams ’s newsletter the other week ( to get this full post from him ) , I ’ve been getting a daily load of “ Health Ranger ” woo in my mailbox .
I ’ve been ignoring most of it , but I thought it worth deconstructing Wednesday ’s rather dangerous piece of Adams misinformation ( some redundancy there , admittedly ) .
Adams thinks he has found something that shows vaccination against the mumps means you are more likely to get the mumps than if you forego the vaccine .
He ’s wrong , of course ( as I will show below ) .
All it shows is that Adams does n't understand his own numbers .
First , check out Adams ’s post , Mumps outbreak spreads among people who got vaccinated against mumps :
To hear the vaccine pushers say it , all the recent outbreaks of mumps and measles are caused by too few people seeking out vaccinations .
It 's all those " non-vaccinated people " who are a danger to society , they say , because they can spread disease .
Reality tells a different story , however :
It is the vaccinated people who are causing these outbreaks and spreading disease !
Just this week , an outbreak of mumps among more than 1,000 people in New Jersey and New York has raised alarm among infectious disease authorities .
The outbreak itself is not unusual , though .
What 's unusual is that the health authorities slipped up and admitted that most of the people infected with mumps had already been vaccinated against mumps .
In Ocean County , New Jersey , county spokeswoman Leslie Terjesen told CNN that 77 percent of those who caught mumps had already been vaccinated against mumps .
[ Bold in original . ]
What he is saying is that more vaccinated kids ( 77 % ) than non vaccinated , got the mumps , therefore you are more likely to get the mumps if you are vaccinated .
He is wrong , because he is asking the wrong question .
He is asking , “ did more vaccinated kids get the mumps than non-vaccinated ? ” ( Answer – yes . 77 % v 23 %. )
The question he should be asking is , “ if you are vaccinated , are you more or less likely to get the mumps ? ” A subtly different question .
The answer to that question is “ less ” – you are less likely to get the mumps if you are vaccinated .
In fact , if you are vaccinated you are one seventh as likely to get the disease , compared with the unvaccinated .
As I will now demonstrate .
Adams is quoting this CNN report as the source for his “ 77 % ” New Jersey figure , so that ’s what I will go with .
From this CNN report , we know that :
The mumps outbreak also spread to Ocean County , New Jersey , where 159 confirmed cases have been diagnosed since September , county spokeswoman Leslie Terjesen told CNN . [...]
Of the New Jersey cases , 77 percent were vaccinated , Terjesen said .
Now , if you look at this CDC table you will see that 96.1 % of New Jersey kindergarten pupils are fully vaccinated against the mumps .
I ’ll round this down to 96 % .
That means , the number of vaccinated children is 24 times ( 96 divided by 4 ) the number of unvaccinated .
Remember that figure .
Now consider this : if in New Jersey , 159 children got the mumps , and 77 % of those were vaccinated , then that means that 122 ( 159 x 77 % ) vaccinated children got the mumps , while 37 unvaccinated children got the mumps .
Hold those numbers too .
Suppose 1,270 * children were exposed to the mumps .
We know that 96 % of these ( on average ) were vaccinated – that ’s 1219 vaccinated children .
51 children ( 4 % ) were unvaccinated .
I ’ll remind you again that 159 children in New Jersey were infected , and that 122 of these ( the infamous 77 % ) were vaccinated .
So , what is the answer to my question , if you are vaccinated , are you more or less likely to get the mumps ?
Some elementary arithmetic :
Vaccinated and got the mumps
122 / 1219 = 10 %
Unvaccinated and got the mumps
37 / 51 = 73 %
Answer – if your child is unvaccinated , he or she is seven times more likely to get the mumps .
So how do we explain the 77 % figure ?
Easy : more vaccinated children got the mumps because there were more vaccinated children to start with .
24 times more as many , to be precise .
If the vaccine were completely useless and offered zero protection against the mumps , we would expect 24 times the number of infected children to be vaccinated , compared with unvaccinated .
( Since both groups would be infected equally , but the vaccinated group is 24 times larger . )
The fact that we only get about three times ( 77/23 ) the number of vaccinated children with the disease , demonstrates how effective the vaccine actually is .
Ironically , the higher the vaccination rates , the higher is the proportion of vaccinated children out of the total who will get the disease .
For example , suppose we have 100 % vaccination rates .
Obviously this would never happen in reality , but just suppose for argument 's sake that the vaccination rate is 100 % .
Also suppose the vaccine is not 100 % effective ( which does reflect reality - the mumps vaccine is only about 90 % effective ) .
What percentage of infected children will be vaccinated ?
Obviously 100 % , since there are zero unvaccinated children in our hypothetical .
Now imagine instead that 0 % of children are vaccinated .
What percentage of infected children now will be vaccinated ?
Obviously 0 % .
So the higher the vaccination rates , the higher the proportion of vaccinated children out of the total who get the disease .
Which is , of course irrelevant .
The relevant fact is that with higher vaccination rates , fewer children overall will get the disease .
I ’ve tried to show this in a table :
Group Total % of Total Infected Group % of Infected Infected % of Group Vaccinated 1,219 96 % 122
77 % 10 % Un- vaccinated 51 4 % 37
23 % 73 % Total 1,270 100 % 159
100 %
Adams is looking at the percentage of each group ( vaccinated v. unvaccinated ) that are infected .
This error is what causes him to write nonsense like this :
Vaccines may actually increase your risk of disease .
Notice that far more vaccinated children were stricken with mumps than non-vaccinated children ?
But , as I ’ve shown , that ’s irrelevant .
The relevant information is the percentage in each group that will become infected .
And seven times the number of unvaccinated children , compared with unvaccinated , get the mumps .
While I understand that this 77 % figure can be confusing for people who are n't used to thinking about these things , Mike Adams does this for a living and so he has no excuse .
And it 's not as if this is a new phenomenon - I remember discussing this exact same thing eight or nine years ago on the JREF forum .
The answers have been out there for a while , so why does Mike Adams still promote these kinds of false conclusions ?
(* I chose the 1,270 figure because according to the CDC the effectiveness of MMR against mumps is approximately 90 % after two doses – which matches the calculated 10 % infection rate with 1,270 children .
The ratio ( 1:7 ) works out exactly the same though , no matter what number of children you assume . )
Senior Apple Exec Jeff Dauber 's passion for technology is matched only by his passion for contemporary art , which is why he called on architect Thom Faulders to build him a backyard deck that is a mind - bending combination of both .
The Japanese maple in Jeff Dauber 's San Francisco backyard is not at the center of a carbon - sucking vortex .
Sorry , sci-fi fans , but the Berkeley - based architect Thom Faulders 's perfectly flat deck only looks like its far corner has its own warped gravity .
Ever since Francesco Borromini's Gallery Spada , in Rome , forced perspectives and architectural patronage have gone hand in hand , but whereas the Renaissance architect employed a mathematician to make that arcade seem longer through foreshortening , Faulders used 3 - D–modeling software to achieve Deformscape 's dipping effect .
" I wanted someone to barf when they look at it , " says Dauber
So Dauber serves guests burgers on the built - in grill only to get a perverse satisfaction when they puke it up later on .
Nice .
But the weirdness does n't end there .
Faulders also designed much of the interior space of the home , turning it into a bachelor pad / art gallery with crazy walls and ceilings that appear to undulate .
Needless to say , if you suffer from motion sickness do n't hang out with this man .

No Deaths from Vitamins , Minerals , Amino Acids or Herbs

Nutritional Medicine is Orthomolecular Medicine
( Natural News )
To hear opponents of natural medicine say it , vitamins and herbs are extremely dangerous for your health .
They should be regulated , we 're told , because they 're so dangerous !
Statistics from the U.S. National Poison Data System prove otherwise .
According to a 174 - page report just published , the number of people killed in 2009 across America by vitamins , minerals , amino acids or herbal supplements is exactly Compare that to the 100,000 ( or so ) Americans killed each year by FDA - approved pharmaceuticals -- and that 's even according to studies published in JAMA .
Also consider the thousands of women harmed or killed by medically - unjustified cancer treatments following false positives from faulty mammograms .
And do n't forget about the more than 16,500 Americans killed each year from internal bleeding caused by NSAIDs ( over - the - counter painkillers ) .
As the July 1998 issue of The American Journal of Medicine explains : ( Singh Gurkirpal , MD , " Recent Considerations in Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug Gastropathy " , The American Journal of Medicine , July 27 , 1998 , p. 31S ) So if NSAIDs alone are killing 16,500 people a year ( or likely much more now , as use of these drugs has risen significantly since 1998 ) , and nutritional supplements are killingpeople a year , why do health regulators try to scare everybody about vitamins being so " dangerous ?
" Pharmaceuticals , meanwhile , are openly allowed to be prescribed for , meaning that doctors can prescribe them for diseases and health conditions for which they 've never even been tested !
What 's wrong with this picture ?
It 's clearly a war against nutrition -- a war against natural medicine -- being waged by the health regulators of the world who are conspiring with Big Pharma to keep the people trapped in a state of malnutrition ( all while profiting from their disease by selling them more patented pharmaceuticals ) .

Here 's what they had to say about the safety of nutritional supplements and the misguided attempts by world governments to limit or outlaw many supplements .
There was not even one death caused by a dietary supplement in 2008 , according to the most recent information collected by the U.S. National Poison Data System .
The new 174 - page annual report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers , published in the journal Clinical Toxicology , shows zero deaths from multiple vitamins ; zero deaths from any of the B vitamins ; zero deaths from vitamins A , C , D , or E ; and zero deaths from any other vitamin .
Additionally , there were no deaths whatsoever from any amino acid or herbal product .
This means no deaths at all from blue cohosh , echinacea , ginkgo biloba , ginseng , kava kava , St. John 's wort , valerian , yohimbe , Asian medicines , ayurvedic medicines , or any other botanical .
There were zero deaths from creatine , blue - green algae , glucosamine , chondroitin , melatonin , or any homeopathic remedies .
Furthermore , there were zero deaths in 2008 from any dietary mineral supplement .
This means there were no fatalities from calcium , magnesium , chromium , zinc , colloidal silver , selenium , iron , or multimineral supplements .
Two children died as a result of medical use of the antacid sodium bicarbonate .
The other " Electrolyte and Mineral " category death was due to a man accidentally drinking sodium hydroxide , a highly toxic degreaser and drain - opener .
No man , woman or child died from nutritional supplements .
Period.61 poison centers provide coast - to - coast data for the U.S. National Poison Data System , which is then reviewed by 29 medical and clinical toxicologists .
NPDS , the authors write , is " one of the few real - time national surveillance systems in existence , providing a model public health surveillance system for all types of exposures , public health event identification , resilience response and situational awareness tracking .
" Over half of the U.S. population takes daily nutritional supplements .
Even if each of those people took only one single tablet daily , that makes 154,000,000 individual doses per day , for a total of over 56 billion doses annually .
Since many persons take more than just one vitamin or mineral tablet , actual consumption is considerably higher , and the safety of nutritional supplements is all the more remarkable .
If nutritional supplements are allegedly so " dangerous , " as the FDA and news media so often claim , then where are the bodies ?
Those who wonder if the media are biased against vitamins may consider this : how many television stations , newspapers , magazines , and medical journals have reported that no one dies from nutritional supplements ?

The Tropicana fruit juice company recently paid to film a commercial in Inuvik .
The shoot coincided with the Sunrise Festival , and the production brought along something amazing : A globe that the Inuvik Drum drescribed as “ a 15,000 pound helium balloon equipped with 40,000 to 70,000 watts of electricity . ”
Amazingly , this bulb was kept floating and intermittently lit for about two days .
The device is from France and is apparently unique in the world .
The globe was used to simulate the sun reappearing over Inuvik in the winter .
Apparently it cost about $ 100 a minute to keep lit , and the commercial is estimated to have cost almost $ 1 million .
AMES , Iowa --
The search for missing Iowa State University senior Jon Lacina , who has not been seen since Jan. 22 , continues .
Lacina 's father called ISU Police the morning of Jan. 30 to report he had not been able to contact his son .
Lacina was last seen leaving a friend 's residence at 300 Stanton Ave. the night of Jan 22 .
ISU Police and other local law enforcement agencies have conducted ground searches in the area between Campustown and Lacina 's residence at Buchanan Hall on the south side of the ISU campus .
The STAR 1 Search and Rescue team began a more extensive search on Sunday morning , Jan. 31 .
ISU staff are additionally searching mechanical rooms , elevator shafts , garages , sheds and other remote locations .
All areas in and around ISU residence halls and apartments are being searched .
Fraternity and sorority leaders also are checking those houses .
ISU Police has requested an air search from Mercy One , a lifeflight helicopter from Des Moines , also to occur today .
Dive teams will search waterways , including Lake LaVerne on the Iowa State campus , to eliminate those areas as possible locations .
" We are leaving no stone unturned , " said Story County Sheriff Paul Fitzgerald .
At this time , the initial search efforts will be done only by trained personnel .
" We appreciate the early offers of help , and ask that any potential volunteers stay available -- but we have adequate resources at this time , " said ISU Police Chief Jerry Stewart .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Genetically Modified crops ( or GM ) are genetically modified organisms ( GMO ) that have been altered to meet a specific profile .
They have also been the subject of controversy almost since their introduction two decades ago .
A new study pinpoints three variations of GM corn ( maize ) as being linked to organ damage in mammals .
The three varieties in question are Mon 810 , Mon 863 , and NK 603 .
The " Mon " is for , you guessed it , Monsanto and the NK is also a Monsanto product , being engineered for herbicide tolerance .
The study was conducted by the Committee of Research and Information on Genetic Engineering ( CRIIGEN ) and the Universities of Caen and Rouen in France .
The study used the same data that was used by Monsanto to gain approval in several parts of the world .
The data was released publicly in 2005 by European authorities when the three GM strains were approved for human consumption in both the U.S. and Europe .
Gilles - Eric Seralini , a molecular biologist at the University of Caen and one of the principals in the study , says that the data " clearly underlines adverse impacts on kidneys and liver , the dietary detoxifying organs , as well as different levels of damages to heart , adrenal glands , spleen and haematopoietic system .
" Each of the three strains produced differing amounts of adverse impact , but the impact on vital organs was universal for all three GM crops .
The study was completed in December 2009 and appears in the International Journal of Biological Sciences ( IJBS ) .
It conforms with and substantiates an earlier study done by CRIIGEN in 2007 on Mon 863 .
The results of that study were rejected by Monsanto .
One controversy many point to when criticizing Monsanto 's counter - analysis as well as the governmental acceptance of the GM crops is in the way Monsanto 's studies were carried out .
Traditionally , when testing drug , pesticide , or other human - ingested items ' safety , the standard protocol is to use three different mammalian species .
Monsanto used only rats for their studies , but still managed to win GMO approval in at least a dozen countries .
Further , the studies were carried out in only 90 day spans , which is not long enough to find most chronic problems .
Other problems with Monsanto's studies should have raised more red flags , but they were ignored by the governmental panels put in charge of making the decision to allow the company 's genetically modified crops into wide distribution in their countries .
The new CRIIGEN study concludes that the raw data makes it clear that all three GMO crops have real problems and should be put under " an immediate ban on the import and export of these GMOs . "
The study also strongly recommends additional long - term , multi-generational animal feeding studies be done on at least three species to provide truly scientific " data on the acute and chronic toxic effects of GM crops , feed and foods .

A couple of companion deals that would send Roy Halladay to Philadelphia and Cliff Lee to Seattle are " close " but " not done , " according to two sources familiar with the negotiations .
As part of the deals , Halladay would agree to a three - year extension through 2013 , with a vesting option that could lengthen the deal by another year or two , one source said .
The extension is expected to guarantee Halladay in the neighborhood of $ 60 million , plus the $ 15.75 million he would make in 2010 , the final year of his current contract .
The specifics of the trades took some twists and turns on Monday .
The latest structure would send three Phillies -- outfielder Michael Taylor , catching prospect Travis d'Arnaud and pitcher Kyle Drabek -- to Toronto , sources said .
Under that scenario , the Phillies would not have to include their top position - player prospect , Domonic Brown , and they would receive Seattle 's top pitching prospect , Phillippe Aumont , who originally appeared ticketed for Toronto .
The Phillies would receive one other prospect -- believed to be 21 - year - old outfielder Tyson Gillies -- from Seattle in the other trade for Lee , who is a year away from free agency .
Indications are that the Phillies also will receive a third prospect in the deal , but it was n't clear Tuesday morning whether that player would come from Toronto or Seattle .
However , ProspectInsider.com reported the third prospect is Mariners right - hander Juan Ramirez .
Initially , sources said , Toronto was to receive Aumont , d'Arnaud and another Phillies prospect in exchange for Halladay .
The Phillies had balked at sending Brown .
Phillies doctors also have to sign off on Halladay 's physical .
The Associated Press reported that J.A. Happ , Joe Blanton and Brown also took physicals in Philadelphia on Monday , but that was before specifics of the deals started to come out .
The AP also reported that the commissioner 's office granted a 72 - hour window on Sunday for Toronto and Philadelphia to complete their trade .
If all of the names being bandied about wind up in this deal , the Phillies would get back what Baseball America rates as the Mariners ' top two pitching prospects , plus an outfield prospect ( Gillies ) they view as being similar to Taylor .
So although the Phillies would be giving up two of their most highly regarded prospects in Drabek and Taylor , they would look at this deal as not significantly depleting their system for the long haul .
Brett Favre 's return for another season is " highly unlikely , but it has been an awesome year , " the Minnesota Vikings quarterback told ESPN's Ed Werder after the Vikings ' loss to the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship Game on Sunday .
Favre , who returned to the NFL from retirement with the goal of leading the Vikings to a championship , fell just short when his pass with seconds left in regulation was intercepted .
The Saints won in overtime to advance to the franchise 's first - ever Super Bowl .
The physical punishment Brett Favre absorbed during Sunday 's NFC Championship left the veteran QB hurting late in the game .

Favre also told Werder before the game that not one Vikings player had inquired about his future because they were so focused on the game .
Favre was n't quite ready to make a decision on his future immediately following the loss , but he said he would n't take long to make his plans known this time .
" Just wondering if I can hold up , especially after a day like today , " Favre said after throwing for 310 yards , one touchdown and two interceptions .
" Physically and mentally .
That was pretty draining .
I am going to go home , a couple of days and just talk it over with the family . "
Without prompting , player after player brought up how fun Favre was to play with .
Respectfully , they declined to speculate about his decision , but the consensus was that he can take all the time he needs even if it means skipping training camp again .
" It 's still early .
Way too early .
Brett is liable to change his mind five , 10 times down the road , " wide receiver Bernard Berrian said .
" He already knows that we want him back .
It 's more or less letting him go off and do his thing . "
After Sunday 's game , Favre staggered to the podium , an abrasion between his eyes , welts on his forehead and tears in his eyes from the beating he took at the hands of the Saints and the realization that his quest to get back to the Super Bowl fell just short again .
For a quarterback who derived so much joy during an improbably successful season for the Vikings , Favre sure did n't look or sound like a player who had much left after a heartbreaking 31 - 28 overtime loss to the Saints .
Favre has one year left on the two - year contract he signed with Minnesota in August , but Vikings coach Brad Childress is n't going to rush him into making a decision on returning for a 20th NFL season .
" I told him go home and lick your wounds and I 'll do the same and we 'll catch up down the road , " Childress said .
" Nobody wants to be rash about any decision - making , I 'm sure , right now . "
A total of 199 wind turbines with a combined capacity of 577 MW were installed at eight new offshore wind farms and connected to the European grid during 2009 .
The development represents a growth rate of 54 % compared to the 373 MW completed during 2008 while for 2010 , the European Wind Energy Association ( EWEA ) expects the completion of 10 additional European offshore wind farms , adding 1000 MW and equivalent to market growth of 75 % compared with 2009 .
According to the trade group there are currently 17 offshore wind farms under construction in Europe , totaling more than 3500 MW , with just under half being constructed in UK waters .
In addition , a further 52 offshore wind farms have won full consent in European waters , totaling more than 16000 MW , with just over half of this capacity planned in Germany .
More than 100 GW of projects are at various stages of planning and could provide enough power to meet 10 % of European electricity demand .
In 2009 , the turnover of the offshore wind industry was approximately € 1.5 billion , and EWEA expects this to double in 2010 to approximately € 3 billion .
“ This is an incredibly good result considering the continued difficulties of obtaining project finance for large projects ” , said Christian Kjaer , EWEA chief executive .
Kjaer also commented : “ Independent project developers , in particular , are still struggling .
For the offshore wind power industry to continue its development , it is vital that governments and the European Commission provide policy frameworks that stimulate investor interest and allow project developers to move their plans forward . ”
He added : “ The push given by the decision to inject €255 million under the European Union ’s European Economic Recovery Plan into the offshore wind sector showed that decision makers understand that offshore wind is key to Europe ’s future energy supplies .
The European Investment Bank ’s ( EIB ) increased involvement will also be instrumental for the future success of offshore wind ’s contribution to European recovery , job creation and technology leadership . ”

Dude , Is That Gold Bar for Real ?
By Doug Hornig , Sr. Editor , Casey ’s Gold & Resource Report
As the 10 - year gold bull continues its stunning run , rumors of fakery seem to be cropping up as fast as new Eagles can be minted .
Should you be worried ?
Do you need to run to the coin shop for a home test kit ?
Well , the counterfeiters are out there , and have been for millennia , but how to counter them ?
You probably remember movies about the Old West , wherein a shady - looking character would offer to exchange a gold coin for a horse , and the nag ’s owner would bite down on the coin .
That was about all you could do , if you lacked proper assaying equipment and had to make a snap judgment on the fly : depend on your teeth to tell you whether the metal in your hand was sufficiently soft to be genuine gold .
The bite test is actually a pretty good one since gold , despite being among the heaviest metals , is also very soft .
If you chomp down and shatter a tooth , it ai n’t gold .
But does that mean you need to munch your way through your coin collection ?
In a word , no .
Not that faking coins would be that hard to do .
This is the 21st century after all , and if there ’s one thing we do well , it ’s making copies of things .
Given contemporary 3 - D laser imaging , a die could be created that mimicked the real deal in perfect detail .
It ’s not as if you could hold your coin up to the light and see the kinds of safeguards built into paper currency these days .
Predictably enough , counterfeiting concerns eventually hit the Internet .
About a year ago , the blogosphere bloomed with doomsday warnings after the publication of a series of articles in Coin World , dealing with the subject of coin counterfeiting in China , where it ’s quasi-legal .
The Web was abuzz with the worries of coin holders and eBay shoppers , as well as the pontifications of pundits about the coming flood of knockoffs from the far East .
Now that did n’t seem right to us .
We ’ve been at this a goodly while , and we ’ve never heard of anyone being slipped a fake Eagle or Maple Leaf .
Just to be on the safe side , though , we checked with a dealer of 30 years ’ experience and got the same answer .
Nope .
Only seen a couple over the past three decades .
The thing is , it ’s really impractical .
Any counterfeit bullion coin would have to be gold in order to pass .
If it were pure , then what would be the point ?
And if the counterfeiter skimped on the gold content , the coin ’s weight would be a dead giveaway .
The only alternative would be to gold - plate a coin made out of some other metal .
But again , getting the weight right while preserving the correct size would be a challenge .
In the end , there ’s just not enough of a profit margin to make it worthwhile .
The exception is rare coins .
These can be made with the proper gold content , then artificially aged so that only an experienced numismatist could pick them out .
Because of the premium they command , faux rare coins made with real gold could be highly profitable where a bullion coin would not .
This is one of the reasons ( impartial grading is the other ) why many collectors will only trade coins graded and slabbed by third - party specialists like Professional Coin Grading Service ( PCGS ) or Numismatic Guaranty Corp. ( NGC ) .
Ominously , though , some counterfeit coins are turning up inside phony slabs , and the graders are taking the threat seriously .
Both the major services have warned about this , with NGC providing guidelines about how to spot fakes of their slabs here http://www.ngccoin.com/news/viewarticle.aspx?IDArticle=954 .
The counterfeits all seem to be originating in China , so one prudent response would be not to trust rare coins offered for sale from that country , especially on eBay .
Gold bars are a separate category .
Fakes do show up in the market from time to time , and they ’re hard to identify .
Generally speaking , counterfeiters do n’t bother with the smaller ones , which are stamped , numbered , and sealed .
They concentrate on 1 - kilogram or larger sizes .
These are poured , rather than stamped , and can be easily adulterated or even hollowed out and filled with some other , cheaper metal .
And that ’s exactly what has happened , on a massive scale … at least if you believe the rumor that exploded across the Net late last year , stating that “ someone ” in Hong Kong had blown the whistle on thousands of tungsten - filled 400 - oz .
“ gold ” bars that are now circulating throughout the world .
Others picked up the story and ran with it , some going so far as to allege that Fort Knox is filled with 640,000 fakes .
Either because we were duped many years ago , or because the government deliberately put them there to hide the fact that most of our gold is gone .
Take your pick .
That tungsten was cited as the culprit is no surprise , because it ’s the metal of choice if you want to imitate a big chunk of gold .
Put some gold plating on tungsten and it will fool all the cheap , non-invasive tests , such as specific gravity , surface conductivity , scratch , and touch stone .
For a conclusive result , you have to drill into the bar , take a core sample , and submit it to more sophisticated verification techniques – fire assay , optical emissions spectroscopy , or X - ray fluorescence – and that involves a lot of time , trouble , and expense .
The market , of course , long ago realized it would be a hassle to fully assay every large gold bar every time it changed hands .
That would create bottlenecks all over the place .
Thus , to facilitate liquidity and protect large traders , the London Bullion Market Association ( LBMA ) came up with the good - delivery bar system , otherwise known as the “ good delivery circuit . ”
The system begins with a group of accredited refiners , all of whom have been certified by equally accredited assayers .
The refiners manufacture the 400 - oz. bars , applying their stamps and serial number before sending them out .
Requirements for making and remaining on the LBMA ’s good - delivery list are stringent , and those on it zealously guard their status .
It ’s of great importance to them because most of the vaults to which they ship product – the next step in the circuit – wo n’t accept anything but good - delivery bars .
This thing is n’t foolproof , nothing is , but it ensures a pretty decent paper trail , a formal , recorded history of who held the bars , when , and in which approved facility – all the way from refiner to end user , whether that be an individual , a central bank , or an ETF .
No buyer wants something from a non-accredited seller , and no one else in the chain wants to get fingered for supplying phony gold .
That would get them kicked out of a very lucrative loop , and sued into the bargain .
What about gold bars that come from a non-accredited source or are otherwise circulating outside the good - delivery circuit ?
That could mean you .
You ’re not part of the circuit to begin with .
And yes , if you bought something that was n’t good - delivery certified , the possibility that you have acquired some fake gold exists .
If you ’re concerned about the source , you might want to have your gold assayed in order to alleviate your worries .
This will become an issue when you choose to sell .
In that instance , a dealer will almost certainly require an assay as part of the bargain , even if you have the chain of custody paperwork and it all checks out .
And you ca n’t blame him .
There ’s no way he can be certain of what you did to it while it was in your possession .
The only exception might be if you have a long - standing , mutually trusting relationship with him , originally bought it from him , and are selling it back to him .
But even that ’s no guarantee .
What you most emphatically want to avoid is the worst - case scenario : arranging a sale , then having your gold flunk an assay , laying you open to charges of fraud .
If you sell to another private owner , rather than a dealer , he will surely ask for an assay , and you should n’t be offended if he does .
Nor should you hesitate for an instant to demand one if you buy from a private party .
Although this is not a recommended way to acquire gold bars , it may be possible that something comes along that you ca n’t refuse .
Just be very careful .
If someone has a gold bar for sale but is in too much of a hurry to wait for an assay , walk away .
Your takeaway from all the hoo - hah about tungsten bars should be that whenever a sensational rumor like this hits the Internet , and it does n’t immediately graduate to Bloomberg , you always have to ask why .
Financial reporters read blogs , too .
You can be sure they ’ve seen the rumor and asked the obvious questions :
What ’s the source ?
Who are the people who reported the appearance of the tungsten bars named ?
For that matter , why are n’t they raising holy hell if they ’ve been ripped off ?
Where are the lawsuits ?
No serious journalist who ca n’t turn up the answers is going to give the story credence .
If it were true , the appearance of several thousand tungsten bars , for each of which someone has been suckered into paying a hundred grand or more , this would be big , big news .
It would n’t stay confined to a few websites for long .
This is n’t to say that someone good is n’t digging deeply into this story right now .
Nor that they wo n’t be able to prove it out .
It is to say that , more than likely , the rumor is false .
In summary , there ’s no reason to believe that there is a real issue with counterfeit bullion coins at the moment .
That does n’t mean they do n’t exist , nor does it mean that evolving technology might not make them more profitable in the future than they are now .
If you ’re at all worried , simply deal with someone you trust .
Establish a relationship with a gold dealer who has built a strong reputation , preferably over a matter of decades .
Buy from them even if you stumble across some mail order supplier who is charging less of a premium .
Some basic guidelines :
For coins , avoid “ commemoratives . ”
Stick with universally recognized government bullion coins ( American Eagle , Canadian Maple Leaf , Austrian Philharmonic , Australian Kangaroo , South African Krugerrand ) .
For small bars , purchase only those that carry the stamp of one of the known , trustworthy refiners , such as PAMP , Credit Suisse , or Johnson Matthey .
For bigger orders , 1 kilo and up , ask your dealer if he has an assay or is willing to have one done .
If you want 100 ounces , insist on an assay or consider buying directly from the Comex , which means you ’ll be assured of getting a good - delivery bar that has never left the circuit .
And the Comex will also vault it for you if you like .
Do not , under any circumstances , buy a larger gold bar on the Internet ; we ’d even balk at buying coins there unless it was from someone we already knew .
We do n’t believe there is reason to be concerned about bullion coins , but if you are the supremely cautious type or perhaps already own some commemoratives , there are tests you can perform at home to check them out .
• First off , you can simply apply a magnet .
Gold is non-magnetic , but if you ’re unlucky enough to have gold - plated steel , it ’ll stick .
• Size and weight are good measures .
Get a scale calibrated to hundredths of a gram .
If a bullion coin weighs light ( or possibly heavy ) , it ’s bogus .
Here ’s a handy list of the major gold coins with their weights , diameters and thicknesses :
http://www.onlygold.com/TutorialPages/Coin_specsFulScreenVersion.htm
• Since real gold has a higher specific gravity than other metals , you can test for that .
Many Internet reference sites will tell you how .
• You could buy a commercial counterfeit detector .
They are n’t cheap , but will quickly and easily perform the basic tests .
• If you have any suspect , non-governmental coins and happen to have some nitric acid handy , you can immerse your coin in the acid .
Base metals will react , gold wo n’t .
However , this is not something to try unless you are highly competent at handling dangerous chemicals ; you do not want to test your skin along with the coin .
In addition , of course , if you do have an alloy coin , the acid will ruin it .
• Rare coins are more of a challenge .
If that ’s where your interest lies , look for specimens that have been graded and slabbed .
Buy from someone you trust .
Never fall for a salesman ’s pitch that a particular numismatic coin is a premier investment , sure to double your money .
Do n’t merely dabble in this area .
What ’s best is if you ’re in it because coin collecting becomes a hobby you ’re passionate about ; worst is if you know and care nothing about what you ’re buying .
Read up on the subject , examine coins , get to know what the real thing looks and feels like , learn to spot the kinds of imperfections that characterize phonies .
Become your own expert , or else risk being the dupe of the day .
And if you do decide to pick up something on your own , send it to NCG or PCGS for grading .
You ’ll quickly learn whether you ’ve been had .
Precious metals are going to be attractive to con artists , just like anything else of real value .
No question about it .
But there are some decent safeguards already built into the system .
If you supplement them with your own knowledge and common sense , it should n’t be difficult to avoid becoming a victim .
And for goodness sake , look after your own interests and do n’t fret about what ’s in Fort Knox .
If it truly is full of tungsten , so much the better for your own holdings .
" I began thinking about how illnesses like diabetes , and hypertension , and asthma were treated , " McLellan said .
" It turns out that they do n't have diabetes programs where you go for 28 days and then stop treatment .
I think that would be called malpractice .
. . .
So those treatments try to retain patients in care , use medications , and education , and family training to reduce symptoms , but also to change behavior to deal with the fact that these illnesses will not be cured - only managed . "

Advertisement British banking chiefs have reacted angrily to news the Treasury is considering a one - year windfall tax on bonuses paid to some UK - based bankers .
A scheme could be unveiled in Alistair Darling 's pre-Budget report this week .
Angela Knight from the British Bankers ' Association ( BBA ) called such taxes " populist , political and penal " .
Chancellor Alistair Darling has said the government would not do anything to damage London 's position as a global financial centre .
" I am determined we do not do anything that undermines that position , " he told a business audience in Horsham .
BBC business editor Robert Peston said taxing bankers might raise no more revenues than a " few hundred million pounds expected by the Treasury " .
Ms Knight said such windfall taxes on bonuses would send the wrong message to the rest of the world about the UK 's position as a banking centre .
" We have already seen quite a few companies shift out of the UK , " the BBA 's chief executive told the BBC .
" It might be popular to put very high taxes on a few [ bankers ] , but we need to know how we would look internationally . "
She added that one million jobs in the UK were supported by the banking industry .
' Serious damage ' Options in Mr Darling 's pre-Budget report on Wednesday may include a super - tax on big bonus earners or a larger employers ' National Insurance charge on banks .
It would not be great for the economic prospects of the UK if wealth - creating bankers and financial institutions emigrated to rival financial centres
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog in full Send us your comments Q&A : Windfall tax on bankers ?
Writing in his blog Robert Peston said : " The advantage of taxing these bonuses are first that they are likely to be pretty popular with more - or - less everyone apart from the bankers , if opinion polls are to be believed .
" But also , taxing bankers rather than banks would not weaken the banks themselves , at a time when they need to accumulate capital . "
He added : " But there might be almost no revenue from it for the Exchequer - even less than the few hundred million pounds expected by the Treasury . "
And one tax expert , Mike Warburton of accountants Grant Thornton , said there were potential problems in identifying who would have to pay any new tax .
" How do you define bankers ?
Would it include people working at Goldman Sachs , who did n't receive a government bail - out ? "
He added : " There is any number of ways I 'm sure that able minds will find to get around any sort of selective tax that 's brought in bonuses . "
State - owned Royal Bank of Scotland reportedly wants to pay a total of £ 1.5 bn in bonuses to investment banking staff , and the board has threatened to quit if the government blocks the move .
Government veto RBS ' financial statements show that one reason why its investment bank has seen a surge in profits has been due to a big change in the way the group presents its accounts
Ian Pollock , Personal finance reporter , BBC News
Analysis : RBS profits - real or illusion ?
Speaking on BBC One 's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday , Mr Darling played down speculation about a windfall tax .
He said the government had a " veto " over bonuses at RBS but said the bank had " not come to us with any proposals at all at the moment because they do n't yet know what the end of year position will be " .
But he stressed : " These bonuses have to be reasonable and they have to be responsible and I think everyone has to accept that . "
He added : " We are not going to be held to ransom by people who believe you can pay extraordinarily high bonuses without regard to what 's going on . "
But he also acknowledged that there had to be " sufficient incentives " to ensure RBS got back onto a " proper footing " and off the government 's books .
' Gifted vast profits ' Robert Peston said if a windfall tax was imposed it would not just apply to UK banks such as Barclays , HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland , but also to the British arms of overseas firms , such as Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank .
When the banks start making profits again they should start paying taxes again
Shadow chancellor George Osborne
Darling warns banks over bonuses Analysis : Manifesto clues ?
" The fact is that we have gifted vast profits to the banks as a result of our actions , " our correspondent quotes one minister as saying .
" If they were using those profits simply to strengthen themselves that would be okay .
But what we can't accept , and what society can't accept , is that they are using those profits to pay enormous bonuses " .
Our correspondent also said taxing the bankers may not be cost - free for the UK .
" It would not be great for the economic prospects of the UK if wealth - creating bankers and financial institutions emigrated to rival financial centres - for fear that the UK is becoming irredeemably hostile to them , " he said .
Mark Tilden , a consultant at CRAI , carries out research on how taxation influences company decisions , said : " I think everyone has always been a bit offended by bonuses of £ 5 m or £ 10 m ... but the fact is these people are mobile and they will leave . "
In the longer term , the prime minister and chancellor want a permanent levy on bank transactions , a so - called Tobin tax .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne , for the Conservatives , said he " would n't rule out " a windfall tax on bonuses , but would prefer reforms to ensure banks pay tax on future profits .
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable told the BBC " a special tax on the banks ' profits " should last as long as the " banks continue to depend on taxpayer guarantees " .

An excellent article published in this month ’s California Lawyer Magazine explores the origins of the federal court challenge to Proposition 8 , aka Perry vs. Schwarzenegger , and how a group of Hollywood activists took on the fight to restore marriage equality , not just in the state of California , but nationwide .
From the article :
As Chad Griffin tells it , the idea for filing a federal challenge to Prop. 8 took shape ten days after it passed with 52 percent of the vote .
Griffin and Kristina Schake , his business partner in the Los Angeles communications firm Griffin / Schake , had joined director Rob Reiner and his wife , Michele , for lunch at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel .
Griffin had produced three television ads and raised money for the “ No on 8 ” campaign ; the Reiners were contributors , as well as Griffin ’s longtime clients .
The four discussed the failed campaign and other election results .
After Griffin left , an acquaintance of the Reiners , Kate Moulene , stopped by and learned that they had discussed Prop .
8 . Moulene later phoned Michele Reiner to suggest they talk to her former brother - in - law , Ted Olson , because , she said , he supported gay marriage .
Though Olson has a long history as a prominent Republican lawyer — he served in both the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations — his leanings tend to be more libertarian than socially conservative .
The Reiners phoned Griffin about contacting Olson .
“ I would have been crazy not to talk to him if it were true that such a prominent conservative and legal scholar was on our side , ” Griffin says .
Because Olson ’s involvement would be major news , secrecy was imperative .
On November 21 , a week after the Polo Lounge lunch , Griffin met Olson at Gibson Dunn ’s Washington , D.C. , office .
There , Olson declared his interest in taking a case challenging the constitutionality of Prop .
8 . It was “ terribly unfortunate ” that Prop. 8 passed , Olson said , particularly because “ Californians have always been in the forefront of liberty and individualism . ”
His own support for gay marriage , he said , dates back more than a decade .
The article goes on to detail much of the friction and the mending of fences between gay groups and those litigating the case .
Though spurned by the court , the LGBT legal groups chose to cooperate with the Perry team .
They have provided background material that includes expert witnesses who had been used in other cases , and briefs from gay - rights litigation .
“ We are interested in doing whatever we can to make sure their case is as successful as possible , ” says James Esseks , co-director of the ACLU ’s LGBT Project .
“ And we wish the plaintiffs ’ legal team the best .
We know they ’re doing everything they can to put together a great case . ”
But does he support the litigation ?
“ What I ’d say is :
We think they ’ve got it right about the law , ” Esseks replied .
“ We think that Prop. 8 violates the federal Constitution .
We think that is crystal clear . ”
The LGBT legal groups also agree that Olson ’s involvement is a significant and positive development .
Kendell says , “ Seeing this person , who was a star of the conservative right , speaking out for the rights of LGBT couples to marry really did feel like , ‘ Gosh , this really could help change people ’s hearts and minds . ’ ” In one of her early conference calls to discuss the complaint , Kendell jokingly named Olson an “ honorary lesbian . ”
It ’s a long , but fascinating read .
And definitely worth the time .

Photographers can do some pretty cool stuff with their cameras .
Everything from macro-photography to high - speed captures of almost instantaneous moments in time .
As much as it might take some pretty hefty equipment to capture those moments the real skill comes in being able to recognize when those moments might happen and then catching them on film .
This is only a portion of a larger collection pulled together by the guys over at Smashing Apps but they ’re the one ’s that caught my eye and I thought I would share .

Port - au - Prince , Haiti ( CNN ) --
The Dominican consul general Wednesday rejected the claim from an American church leader that she thought her paperwork was in order when she attempted to take 33 Haitian children out of the country , saying he had told her it was not .
" I warned her , I said as soon as you get there without the proper documents , you are going to get into trouble , because they are going to accuse you , because you have the intent to pass the border without the proper papers and they are going to accuse you with kids trafficking , " Carlos Castillo said he told the group 's leader , Laura Silsby , during a meeting Friday .
Four hours later , Silsby and nine other Americans were turned back from the border .
They were arrested and taken to a jail in Port - au - Prince .
" This woman knew what she was trying to do was not legal , " Castillo said .
A CNN reporter attempted to get reaction to Castillo 's comment from the jailed Americans , but they would not discuss the matter , responding to questions by singing " Amazing Grace " and praying .
Told earlier that many of the children had living parents , Silsby said , " I did not know that . "
She added , " In our hearts , our intention was to help children that had been orphaned or abandoned by their parents . "
But the interpreters the group had used said the conversations between Silsby and the parents in the Haitian town of Calebasse made clear to them that Silsby must have been aware of the children 's status .
Full coverage of Haiti earthquake aftermath
SOS Children 's Villages , an Austrian charity , said that it has determined that at least two - thirds of the children are not orphans .
Authorities on Wednesday questioned a Haitian police officer who works at the Dominican Embassy about whether he provided illegal paperwork to Silsby and the other Americans to facilitate their efforts as alleged by interpreters who had translated for the Americans .
The interpreters told CNN the Americans met at least twice last week with the officer , at the embassy and consulate .
" He told them that he could help , and he was helping them with some paper , " said interpreter Steve Adrien .
" We did not meet him in a police station , but in the street in a car . "
The Americans met again with the man in Port - au - Prince on Thursday , near the Dominican Embassy , the translator said .
Isaac Adrien , Steve 's brother and another of the interpreters , said the group came away from the meeting with a document from the embassy that the Americans took with them to the border Friday in their unsuccessful attempt to cross .
i Report : How you can help
A Haitian lawyer representing the Americans told reporters that the arrests themselves were illegal and that their clients had only been trying to help .
They are to appear Thursday before the attorney general .
The group , New Life Children 's Refuge , said it was rescuing abandoned children by moving them to the Dominican Republic , where it was building an orphanage .
At least some of the group are members of the Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian , Idaho .
Several residents of the village of Calebasse , more than an hour from Port - au - Prince , told CNN they voluntarily handed over their children after Silsby told them she would give them a better life .
Pastor Jean Sainvil told CNN he rounded up 20 children from a camp in the Delmas neighborhood of the capital .
" I just got the word out that I am going to look for some children to be going with a group of missionaries , " he said .
Some of those who responded apparently included parents .
" One of them turned five children over , " he said .
He said no money changed hands .
The group has no experience running an orphanage , has not registered as an international adoption agency and has not filed with the U.S. government as a nonprofit .
Church pastor Clint Henry was unfazed .
" I believe that the kind of knowledge that it takes to begin an organization that works that way was in place , " he told CNN .
" The kind of employees that it takes to successfully run an orphanage , those were going to be hired . "
The matter drew attention Wednesday from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
" It was unfortunate that , whatever the motivation , that this group of Americans took matters into their own hands , " she said .
The number of Haitian orphans taken to the United States -- those whose approval and paperwork had been in the bureaucratic pipeline at the time of the disaster -- stands at 578 , with 44 others processed and awaiting transportation , said U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley .
CNN 's Dan Simon in Meridian , Idaho ; Karl Penhaul in Port - au - Prince , Haiti ; Jill Dougherty in Washington ; and Fionnuala Sweeney in Atlanta , Georgia , contributed to this report .
If you are living in the United States and are into food and sourcing your own local ingredients , there has never been a better time .
All over the country , farmers markets are popping up , and more people have access to small , local producers and purveyors .
Here in Northern California , we have a plethora of small farms doing amazing stuff , all organic , free - range , and devoid of antibiotics .
One of my favorite farms is Prather Ranch .
While they produce mostly beef , retail shop owner Doug Stonebreaker recently started a herd of pigs under the Range Brothers label , and they are absolutely fantastic .
I caught up with Doug at his retail shop at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market in San Francisco to ask him what makes his pork so special .
Doug looks like a real cowboy and is wearing a shirt bearing the words “ PRAISE THE LARD . ”
Read the eBook for the full interview and a delicious recipe that is tailored to this high - quality pork .

Range Brothers Bone - In Pork Shoulders Chop with Sauteed Brussel Sprouts
Recipe courtesy of James Stolich of CookWithJames.com .
This has to be one of my favorite pork cuts .
It really only works with the best quality pork , so make sure you are either buying direct from Prather Ranch / Range Brothers or from a small , local producer of heritage pigs .
The fat and marbling on this cut are amazing , and I like to simply grill it like a steak .
When done right , it ’s incredibly tender and succulent with loads more flavor than your typical loin or even rib chop .
Ingredients
4 bone - in shoulder cut heritage pork chops
salt & pepper
extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 pound brussels sprouts , peeled and trimmed of excess leaves , cut into
¼ ” round slices
¼ ” round slices ½ pound maple - wood - smoked bacon ( or any good - quality artisan bacon
or pancetta from a heritage pig )
or pancetta from a heritage pig ) ½ cup dry white wine
2 tablespoons of best - quality dried Herbs De Provence
Instructions
Take your shoulder chops out of the refrigerator at least one hour prior
to cooking .
Liberally season them with salt and drizzle with olive oil .
Rub the oil and salt into them and allow them to come to room temperature .
Meanwhile , prepare your brussels sprouts for cooking by cutting off
the bottom and peeling off the tougher outer leaves .
Then slice each
sprout — depending on size — into 2 - to - 3 ¼ ” round pieces .
Cut your bacon
up into a medium dice .
Now that all your “ mise en place ” is done , you are ready to cook .
In a
medium sauté pan , heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil with the butter over
high heat until almost smoking .
Add the brussels sprouts and cook on one
side until nicely brown and caramelized , approximately 4 - 5 minutes .
Gently
salt them and season with the herbs .
Flip the sprouts and continue cooking .
Add the bacon and stir through .
Lower the heat to medium and cook
until the other side of the sprouts is slightly brown and the bacon is
rendered but not overly cripsy .
Turn the heat down to low and de-glaze the
pan with white wine .
Continue cooking at a simmer until the alcohol has
burned off , approximately 3 - 4 minutes .
Take off the heat and set aside and
keep warm .
Heat up your countertop grill on high or a grill pan over a high flame
( or do this over a wood fire or barbecue ) .
For countertop grill :
When ready , place pork shoulder
on grill and close .
Cook for 3 - 5 minutes or until an instant read thermometer inserted
into the thickest part of the pork ( not touching the bone ) reads 130º .
For grill pan :
When the grill is very hot , place the pork shoulder into the center of the grill pan .
Cook without disturbing for approximately 4 - 5 minutes ,
depending on the thickness of the cut .
Flip and cook another 3 minutes on
the other side or until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest
part of the pork ( not touching the bone ) reads 130º .
The chops should be nicely browned on both sides .
Remove to a cutting board
and let rest for at least 8 minutes .
To plate , arrange several spoonfuls of the brussels sprouts / bacon mixture
onto the center of four plates .
Place a cooked pork shoulder chop over
the top of each and drizzle with pan juices .
Buon Appetito !

WASHINGTON --
Do you believe in miracles ?
I do , and here 's the proof : Dick Cheney said something reasonable .
I heard it with my own ears .
In the latest of his regular Sunday morning fireside chats , when he customarily tries to scare the nation silly with ghost stories and other tall tales , Cheney said it 's time to " reconsider " the ridiculous " do n't ask , do n't tell " ban on gays in the military , and added that he believes the policy will be changed .
Unsurprisingly , that nugget of good sense came amid an avalanche of the usual blather .
Speaking on ABC's " This Week , " Cheney demonstrated once again that he spends most of his time in some parallel universe .
In the real world , the Obama administration inherited an unnecessary and ill - advised war in Iraq whose main geopolitical impact has been to strengthen neighboring Iran and its dangerous regime .
But in Bizarro Cheney World , apparently , Obama somehow owes his predecessor " a healthy dose of ' thank you , George Bush . ' "
Cheney also criticized the administration 's anti-terror policies -- or rather the Obama team 's " mindset . "
One of his specific gripes was Obama 's ban on torture .
" I was a big supporter of waterboarding , " said the former vice president of the United States .
If the Bush - Cheney administration 's White House lawyers could invent a legal justification for torture , can't somebody come up with a theory that would allow retroactive impeachment ?
But back to the news :
Cheney became perhaps the most prominent conservative voice thus far to speak out in support -- or , at least , acceptance -- of the Obama administration 's decision to end " do n't ask , do n't tell " and allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military .
Cheney stopped short of saying flatly that he advocated a change .
He based his view that " it 's time to reconsider the policy " on the public statements of Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and other military brass in support of ditching " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
But Cheney did volunteer that " things have changed significantly " in the two decades since he ran the Pentagon as secretary of defense under George Bush the Elder .
" I think the society has moved on , " he said .
" I think it 's partly a generational question . "
Last week , a Washington Post - ABC
News poll found that 75 percent of Americans favor letting gay people serve openly in the military .
This compares with just 44 percent when the poll asked the question in 1993 .
Those in favor of tolerance include 64 percent of Republicans -- along with bigger majorities of Democrats and independents -- and , in what may be the poll 's most significant finding , 81 percent of young adults under 30 .
In other words , abandoning the policy has overwhelming support among the age group that the nation depends on to enlist in the all - volunteer armed forces .
Four out of five respondents who said they have a gay friend or family member favored allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly .
It 's relevant to note that one of Cheney 's daughters , Mary , is a lesbian who lives with her longtime partner , Heather Poe , and their two children .
It 's also worth mentioning that Cheney has said he has no objection to gay marriage and believes the issue should be left up to the states -- a stance that puts him considerably to the left of President Obama , who says he opposes gay marriage .
" I think that freedom means freedom for everyone , " Cheney said last June .
" As many of you know , one of my daughters is gay and it is something we have lived with for a long time in our family .
I think people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish . "
What does this tell us ?
Basically , just that once or twice a year Cheney says something reasonable about gay rights before hastily retreating to his fortress of solitude , where he worries that archvillain Saddam Hussein still plots to use his stockpile of imaginary weapons of mass destruction against the United States , despite the impediment of being deceased .
But Cheney 's burst of lucidity should help Republicans in Congress understand that there is no longer any reliable constituency for the troglodyte position on " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
If a long - overdue policy shift that would allow gay people to serve openly in the armed forces is fine with three - fourths of the American public , the top officers in the Pentagon hierarchy and Dick Cheney , too , then the times are n't just a -changing .
They 've already changed .
Last week , couple of videos surfaced of pyramid shaped UFO hovering over Kremlin in Russia , Moscow .
The videos ( check below ) sent shockwaves throughout Russia .
The flying object , which witnesses said could be up to a mile wide , was filmed by two amazed spectators – one at night from a car and another during the day .
The hovering pyramid has been likened to Darth Vader ’s Imperial Cruiser in Star Wars and has been showed repeatedly on Russian news channels .

One question though – with the current times where everyone has a video camera in almost every cellphone , why one two videos ?
Fake or real – what do you guys think ?
It ’s official , the next iteration in the Call of Duty franchise will be set in the late 1960s , during the Vietnam War .
Rumors had been flying around all week about Call of Duty heading to Vietnam but it has been confirmed by CVG through a senior UK trade source that the title will be developed by Treyarch and a release date close to November this year could be a possibility .
The source also mentioned that the game ’s development is on course and it takes particular influence from Platoon and Apocalypse Now .
So those of you who skipped through the Russian airport level in Modern Warfare 2 , can expect a similar dilemma i.e whether or not to play through the My Lai Massacre level , which , we can bet , will be featured in the game .
The gaming world was set alight today after Infinity Ward , the development team behind the popular Call of Duty gaming series , announced that patch # 489 will include a new ' super awesome ' in - game feature that will indefinitely put an end to the culture of cheating that has plagued their newest game since its long - awaited release .
In a bid to glean some more information , we contacted
" I 've been working for the safety of children for twenty five years now , and what do I get back in return ?
A nuke up the ass !
Yea , that 's right - I get nuked by some little cunt who was boosting with his friends .
I was two kills away from a chopper gunner and this little shit nukes my fucking balls off .
I 'll say this loudly and clearly ; anybody that is caught boosting or glitching is fair game for a beating in my eyes .
The little fucks . "
" This might surprise some , but President Obama is a huge Call of Duty fan .
He even has the Fall camouflage on his ACR .
Nothing annoys the President more than glitchers .
The other night him and Gordon Brown were playing domination in Kirachi , when a guy on the opposite team called xXx - SxYbOyNoScOpeZ-xXx started glitching , costing Barack and Gordon the match .
Nothing is more important to Obama than his Win-Loss ratio .
The next day Obama was in such a foul mood that he decided to send more troops into Afghanistan and was literally seconds away from invading Iran .
All of this online cheating really does have a negative effect on the world of international politics .
For instance , it is common knowledge that Bush invaded Iraq , not because of WMDs or oil , but because Saddam and his sons would simply not stop camping . "
When asked about the legal implications of having such a feature , Bowling replied that every lawmaker and judge he has contacted about the tool have all shown their complete support .
One judge , who can't be named for legal reasons , even went so far as to say that he 'll have his golf shoes sharpened and ready for the day the patch is released .
We decided to contact George Hammertoes over at the IPC ( International Protection for Children ) and ask him for his opinion on the matter : Speaking to a source from inside the White House :
We 'll stay tuned to this story and provide you with updates about developments as they happen .
Iris Robinson obtained £ 50,000 for Kirk McCambley with whom she was having a sexual relationship Northern Ireland 's First Minister Peter Robinson is coming under increased political pressure over allegations about his wife 's financial affairs .
A BBC programme asked why the DUP leader did not tell the authorities his wife had not registered £ 50,000 she obtained from two property developers .
Iris Robinson used the money to help her young lover start a business .
Mr Robinson said he will " resolutely defend " attacks on his character and " contest any allegation of wrongdoing " .
He is to speak to the media later on Friday .
BBC Northern Ireland 's Spotlight programme said Iris Robinson broke the law by not declaring her financial interest in the business deal .
ANALYSIS Mark Simpson , BBC Ireland Correspondent
At first it seemed that the family turmoil of Peter and Iris Robinson was simply a personal matter , but now it has become political .
It has been a sudden change .
As the couple 's marriage troubles were splattered over every media outlet in Belfast earlier this week , even their most bitter opponents held back .
There was no party - political gloating or opportunism .
The public appeared to be overwhelmingly supportive too .
The revelations were such a surprise that the reaction of most people was simply to gulp .
However , no sooner had the credits rolled on the BBC Spotlight programme at 11 pm on Thursday than politicians started reacting by text , telephone and Twitter .
The most significant response came shortly after 1 am , when Ulster Unionist Party leader Sir Reg Empey e-mailed a statement calling for an investigation into the conduct of Mr Robinson .
The political ceasefire is over and Mr Robinson faces a bruising battle for survival .
Reaction : Iris Robinson revelations
Peter Robinson rejects allegations
Who 's involved ?
Timeline of allegations
She obtained the money from two property developers , which was paid to her 19 - year - old lover to help him launch a cafe .
She later asked him for £ 5,000 for herself .
Deputy First Minister , Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness , has said he is seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Robinson .
Mr McGuinness said he was " shocked " by what he watched on the Spotlight programme and wants to discuss specifically the financial issues raised and the implications it has for the Office of First and Deputy First Minister .
The Prime Minister 's official spokesman said that the prime minister 's view was that completing the devolution process in Northern Ireland was very important .
He said it was not for the prime minister to comment on personal issues .
Sir Alistair Graham , the former chair of committee on standards in public life , said a major investigation into the allegations was called for .
" On the basis of these allegations it seems to me that , prima facie , there are grounds for a major investigation by the various commissioners who have responsibility for standards in Westminster and the Northern Ireland Assembly , and presumably at a local council level as well , " he said .
Councillors in Castlereagh have ordered their acting chief executive to investigate the claims made in the programme which relate to the council .
Mrs Robinson , who tried to kill herself after her affair , was said to be unable to comment for health reasons .
Spotlight also reported that her husband Peter Robinson became aware of the money she had received from the developers .

The programme said that while he pressed his wife to return the money , he failed to tell the proper authorities about the transaction , despite being obliged to act in the public interest by the ministerial code .
Mr Robinson said on Friday comments and conclusions were made on the programme " without any supporting facts " .
" While I have learned from Spotlight for the first time some alleged aspects of my wife 's affair and her financial arrangements , I will be resolutely defending attacks on my character and contesting any allegations of wrongdoing , " he said .
Inn Much of the information in the programme came from Selwyn Black , a former RAF chaplain , who worked for Mrs Robinson for two years .
He showed the programme makers over 150 text messages he received from Mrs Robinson .
Iris Robinson said in December that she was retiring from public life because of an ongoing battle with mental illness .
On Wednesday , she released a statement in which she admitted that she had tried to take her own life after what she described as a brief affair .
Spotlight revealed that the man with whom Mrs Robinson had the affair was Kirk McCambley , now 21 , and the joint owner of Lock Keeper 's Inn in south Belfast .
The programme reported that a sexual relationship between the two began in the summer of 2008 .
Mrs Robinson then revealed to Selwyn Black she intended to set up Mr McCambley in business .
At that time Castlereagh Borough Council , on which Mrs Robinson serves as a councillor , had advertised for a tenant to run a cafe at a new project on the banks of the River Lagan .
The programme reported that Mrs Robinson then sought to provide Mr McCambley with capital to open the business .
She obtained a total of £ 50,000 from two developers , Fred Fraser , now deceased , and Ken Campbell to fund the project .
Spotlight reported that while Mrs Robinson was asking Mr Campbell for the money , she also lobbied on his behalf for one of his building projects in her parliamentary constituency .
Mr McCambley said he received two cheques , which he invested in kitchen equipment and furniture .
He also told the programme that after he received the money Mrs Robinson had then asked him to give her £ 5,000 in cash .
Spotlight reported that in July 2008 , six weeks after Castlereagh Borough Council advertised for expressions of interest in the cafe project , only one applicant met the criteria - Mr McCambley .
The deal was sealed on 28 August and Iris Robinson was in attendance as the council authorised the signing of the lease .
The laws covering local government state that once Mrs Robinson had a financial interest in the business , she was obliged to declare it at any meeting she attended where it was being considered .
She failed to do so .
Code of conduct Spotlight reported that she also broke a cluster of other rules in the Code of Conduct for councillors - as many as five elements of the code .

As an MP , she was also legally obliged to declare the £ 50,000 she received from the developers in the register of members ' interest at both Stormont , where she served as an MLA , and Westminster .
She failed to do so .
Some time later , Mrs Robinson 's relationship with Mr McCambley ended .
At some point afterwards , she decided that he should pay back the money that had been given to him .
Mrs Robinson told Mr McCambley that half the money should be paid to her and the other half to a church in east Belfast where her husband 's sister worked as a pastor .
It is understood she later decided that the money should be returned to Ken Campbell .
When Peter Robinson found out about his wife 's financial dealings , he insisted that the money should be returned .
However he did not tell the proper authorities despite being obliged by the ministerial code to act in the public interest at all times .
On Thursday , Mr Robinson 's solicitors said he was thoroughly satisfied that he has at all times acted properly and fulfilled all requirements , and would robustly challenge any allegation to the contrary .

We do n't know what went wrong exactly , but the little geniuses wo n't be coming to Fox after all .
In a strange turn of events , Fox announced today that " Our Little Genius " wo n't premiere on Jan. 13 because executive producer Mark Burnett ( " Survivor " and " Celebrity Apprentice " ) does n't want the episodes to air .
“ I recently discovered that there was an issue with how some information was relayed to contestants during the pre-production of ‘ Our Little Genius , ' Burnett said in a statement released by Fox .
" As a result , I am not comfortable delivering the episodes without reshooting them .
I believe my series must always be beyond reproach , so I have requested that Fox not air these episodes . ”
A Fox spokesman would not elaborate as to what went wrong .
The show , which gives preteen prodigies a change to test their knowledge for a lot of money , has been under fire by some critics for its potential for harming children emotionally or psychologically .
A New York Times story on Wednesday described producers shooting alternate endings with families because children were taking their losses really hard .
The Fox spokesman said the status of the show is unknown .
The network may reshoot the episodes , but it may not .
[ Updated 4:04 p.m. : Mark Burnett Productions will reshoot the episodes , but Fox has not decided if it will air the series . ]
Fox also released a statement : “ Mark Burnett is one of the preeminent producers of unscripted programming on television .
Even though we were incredibly pleased with the quality of ‘ Our Little Genius , ’ we respect and appreciate his due diligence and the decision to pull these episodes .
We agree there can be no question about the integrity of our shows .
While these episodes will not air , the families who participated in the show will receive their winnings , and we are grateful for their participation . ”
Burnett could not immediately be reached for an interview .
[ Updated : 4:04 p.m. : Sources say Burnett 's concerns have to do with contestants being given more information than they should have and are not related to the concerns expressed by outsiders in the New York Times . ]

The US Senate has passed a sweeping healthcare reform bill , bringing Barack Obama a step closer to enacting one of his signature campaign promises and to meeting a goal sought by US presidents for decades .
The early - morning vote in the first Christmas Eve session for decades came after months of intense negotiations by the president 's allies in the Senate , who were forced to wrangle for every Democratic vote in the chamber to overcome Republican opposition .
Obama welcomed the outcome , saying it brought decent healthcare closer to all Americans .
" We are now finally poised to deliver on the promise of real , meaningful health insurance reform , " he said at the White House .
" With today 's vote , we are now incredibly close to making health insurance reform a reality in this country .
Our challenge then is to finish the job . "
The $ 871bn bill will be merged with similar legislation passed by the House of Representatives , with a final version expected to reach the president 's desk by mid-February .
Negotiators will have to iron out differences between the two bills on coverage for abortion .
Among other distinctions , the Senate - passed bill does not establish a government - run health insurance programme , a provision sought by Obama and congressional liberals .
The Senate bill passed on a 60 - 39 party line vote .
The overhaul is expected to extend health insurance to 30 million Americans who currently lack it .
For the first time , Americans will be required to obtain health insurance , and insurers will be forbidden from denying coverage based on patients ' pre-existing conditions .
Those who cannot get insurance through their employers will have access to a government - regulated health insurance exchange and may receive subsidies .
A government - run insurance programme for the poor will be vastly expanded .
The bill was denounced by Republican leaders who vowed to maintain their opposition , despite using every parliamentary tool permitted to slow the legislation 's progress .
They say the bill is too costly and amounts to a government takeover of healthcare .
The party hopes that voters infuriated by the bill will turn the Democrats out office in the November 2010 elections .
" This debate was supposed to produce a bill that reformed healthcare in America , " said the Republican senate leader , Mitch McConnell .
" Instead , we 're left with party line votes in the middle of the night , a couple of sweetheart deals to get it over the finish line , and a public that 's outraged . "
The bill has angered the president 's allies on the left , who have criticised the exclusion of a public health insurance programme and restrictions on abortion coverage , both modifications necessary to win over conservative Democrats .
Senator Joe Lieberman , of Connecticut , an independent who is nominally allied with the Democrats , forced the removal of a public insurance programme , angering many Democrats , while Ben Nelson , a Nebraska Democrat , agreed to support the bill only after it was amended on insurance coverage for abortion .
Although repeated rounds of sanctions over many years have not dissuaded Iran from pursuing nuclear technology , an administration official involved in the Iran policy said the hope was that the current troubles “ give us a window to impose the first sanctions that may make the Iranians think the nuclear program is n’t worth the price tag . ”
While outsiders have a limited view of Iran ’s nuclear program , the Obama administration officials said they believed that the bomb - development effort was seriously derailed by the exposure three months ago of the country ’s secret enrichment plant under construction near the holy city of Qum .
Exposure of the site deprived Iran of its best chance of covertly producing the highly enriched uranium needed to make fuel for nuclear weapons .
In addition , international nuclear inspectors report that at Iran ’s plant in Natanz , where thousands of centrifuges spin to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel , the number of the machines that are currently operating has dropped by 20 percent since the summer , a decline nuclear experts attribute to technical problems .
Others , including some European officials , believe the problems may have been accentuated by a series of covert efforts by the West to undermine Iran ’s program , including sabotage on its imported equipment and infrastructure .
These factors have led the administration ’s policy makers to lengthen their estimate of how long it would take Iran to accomplish what nuclear experts call “ covert breakout ”  the ability to secretly produce a workable weapon .
“ For now , the Iranians do n’t have a credible breakout option , and we do n’t think they will have one for at least 18 months , maybe two or three years , ” said one senior administration official at the center of the White House Iran strategy .
The administration has told allies that the longer time frame would allow the sanctions to have an effect before Iran could develop its nuclear ability .
MyFreeRead.com : Not Quite What It Appears
Earlier this week , I received an email from a company called MyFreeRead.com , enticingly titled , “ Authors : We Want Your e-Books & Articles ! ”
Dear Authors ,
We want your e-books — and we ’ll pay you for them !!
* e-Books
* Newsletters
* Excerpts from books
* Self - Published Articles
Now , there ’s a new idea … actually get paid for writing your e-books and articles !
We ’re launching a brand new website , where visitors can download free e-books on everything from running a business to fixing a car … and WE PAY OUR AUTHORS US $ 0.20 every time an e-book is successfully downloaded !
Gee , 20 cents a download–who could resist ?
Me , for one .
I might have written this off as just one more random spam–but then I began hearing from writers who ’d gotten the very same email offer .
The volume of questions began to suggest a sizeable spam campaign , which always gets my Writer Beware radar twitching .
Visiting the MyFreeRead website , I learned that “ MyFreeRead.com works with a leading cost - per-action ad network .
Visitors simply take a fun online survey and look at a few ads , then they can download their favorite e-book ABSOLUTELY FREE !
All offers are optional , and visitors never have to buy anything . ”
( Per Wikipedia , cost - per-action “ is an online advertising pricing model , where the advertiser pays for each specified action ( a purchase , a form submission , and so on ) linked to the advertisement . ” )
I searched MyFreeRead ’s website , but nowhere is the “ leading CPA ad network ” named .
So I emailed Lisa Davis , MyFreeRead ’s Coordinator , to ask .
Within minutes , I received this response :
That ’s confidential .
Why should it matter ?
Well , I wrote back , because of concerns about malware , tracking cookies , and the like .
There ’s a lot of that stuff about , and I would n’t want to think my readers were targets .
I was n’t entirely surprised when I did n’t hear back .
MyFreeRead appears still to be building its catalog , so there are currently no actual ebooks available for download .
However , there ’s a sample download page , and if you click the “ Download ” button , a window pops up with a choice of surveys .
Hovering my mouse over these surveys , I discovered that their source is CPAlead.com ( warning : if you click that link you will be ambushed by audio ) , “ a performance - based , online advertising network that develops technologies to promote incentive - based advertisements across niche websites . ”
In other words , as a website owner offering products to the public , you can sign up to become a CPAlead “ Publisher , ” which enables you to create a “ gateway ” that forces would - be consumers of your products to take a survey ( examples : “ Which Twilight Character Are You ? ” “ Do You Shop at Target ? ” “ Want a Free BMW ? ” ) , and then watch ads from CPAlead ’s advertiser clients , before they can download your product .
You can see why this would be popular with website owners .
Scroll down to the bottom of this blog post , and you ’ll see some examples of the kinds of payouts CPAlead provides for each completed survey –from a high of $ 4.50 ( for “ Win a Dell Laptop ” ) to a low of 45 cents ( for “ Can You Spot the Frogs ? ” ) .
This extremely long discussion thread at the Digital Point Forums contains testimonials from people who claim to have earned substantial income with CPAlead .
Plus , per CPAlead ’s Terms and Conditions , you can set yourself up like a multi- level marketing scheme , recruiting “ sub- publishers ” to distribute CPAlead ’s offers and surveys , and , presumably , to give you a cut of their income .
But how do consumers respond ?
Not well .
Google CPAlead.com , and you ’ll find numerous conversations about how to block it .
Worse , on the discussion boards at Web of Trust , a safe - surfing utility , there are complaints about phishing , malware , and adware associated with CPAlead ’s advertisers .
It seems clear that MyFreeread.com is not an epublishing endeavor , but a way for Ms. Davis to make money via an advertising network .
The 20 cents that authors are paid for downloads will , in many cases , barely make a dent in her profit .
Authors , is worth 20 cents to you to annoy your readers in this way ?
Especially when you can self - publish to the Kindle , and set your own price ?
The latest Hollywood blockbuster Sherlock Holmes revolves around occult murders and world conspiracies .
The movie is riddled with occult symbols and allusions to a “ New Order ” .
We ’ll look at the history of Sherlock Holmes , the origins of the symbols found in the movie and its meaning in today ’s context .
Inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ’s stories , the movie Sherlock Holmes brings back to life the famous detective of the nineteen century .
The plot revolves around murders that are apparently connected with occult rituals .
This leads Sherlock into the mysterious world of secret societies and political conspiracies .
Doyle ’s works contained some vague references to occultism or Freemasonry ; the movie , however , focuses solely around those themes and incorporates elements that are very relevant in today ’s context : a New World Order lead by secret societies .
Although no real - life secret society is actually mentioned , numerous symbols and references are peppered throughout the movie taken directly from Freemasonry , Rosicrucianism or the Illuminati .
Cleverly embedded into the scenes and never really explained , those symbols can almost be considered hints to insiders concerning the real inspirations of the movie .
Let ’s look at the Masonic background of the original author of Sherlock Holmes , Arthur Conan Doyle , and how this influence has been taken to the “ next level ” in the movie .
Arthur Conan Doyle “ Spiritualist and Freemason ”
Doyle was born into an Irish Catholic family in Edinburgh , Scotland in 1859 .
At age eleven , he was sent to a Jesuit school , Stonyhurst College , in which he was said to have spent “ five unhappy and lonely years ” .
After obtaining his Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery from Edinburgh University , Doyle developed a great interest in spiritualism .
In an article appeared in MQ ( the official Journal of the United Grand Lodge of England ) , Freemason Yasha Beresiner explains Conan Doyle ’s interest in spiritualism and Masonry :
“ He first set up a practice with a fellow student Dr Budd , but soon parted company having been accused of not pulling his weight , and moved , with his newly wedded wife Louise Hawkins , to Southsea near Portsmouth in Hampshire where he established himself as an eye specialist .
It was here that between 1885 and 1888 he attended a number of table turning sittings at the home of General Drayson a teacher at Greenwich Naval College , who was one of his patients .
These sessions were experimental and Doyle was critical both of the procedures and the ritual involved , which he called a farce .
He also questioned the intellect of the sitters .
But he was hooked .
In 1887 , the year he became a freemason , he joined the Society for Psychical Research , this was a public declaration , as it were , of his interest and belief in the occult .
It was in this state of mind , exceedingly curious and now seriously delving into the world of spiritualism , that on the 26th of January 1887 Arthur Conan Doyle was initiated into Freemasonry at the Phoenix Lodge No 257 in Southsea , Hampshire .
He was 27 years old . ”
- Yasha Beresiner , Arthur Conan Doyle Spiritualist and Freemason , MQ , July 2007
It was the Phoenix Lodge no. 257 where Doyle befriended a certain Dr. James Watson , who became the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes ’ trusty sidekick .
Beresiner continues :
“ It would be logical to presume that Doyle came into Freemasonry expecting , maybe hoping , to discover elements of the spiritualism that now occupied his mind .
He was certainly well recommended .
His proposer was W. D. King , later Sir William David King , Deputy - Lieutenant for Hampshire , a most prominent public man in Portsmouth who was elected Mayor of the borough on four separate occasions .
His seconder was Sir John Brickwood an equally respected and successful Brewer in the city .
Doyle rose rapidly through the degrees .
On 23 February 1887 he was passed to the second degree and a month later , on 23 March he was made a full - fledged Master Mason . ”
– Ibid
Doyle then resigned from Freemasonry only to rejoin several times during his life .
Masonry was sometimes mentioned in Doyle ’s writings , which were not all focused on Sherlock Holmes .
In The Land of Mist , published in 1926 , Doyle describes the character Weatherby :
“ … that is a pompous a-s named Weatherby .
He is one of those who wander about on the obscure edges of Masonry , talking with whispers and reverence on mysteries where no mystery is .
Spiritualism , with its very real and awful mysteries , is , to him , a vulgar thing because it brought consolation to common folk , but he loves to read papers on the Palladian Cultus , ancient & accepted Scottish rites and baphometic figures .
Eliphas Levi is his prophet . ”
Throughout his adventures , Sherlock Holmes ( who was not a Mason ) has proved to be quite knowledgeable of Freemasonry , spotting Masonic rings and other clues with ease .
Symbols in the Movie
This analysis wo n’t focus on the actual storyline , but rather on the numerous symbols peppered throughout the film .
There might be some spoilers in here , though .
Sherlock Holmes contains plenty of themes and symbols taken directly from today ’s secret societies .
They are very subtle and rarely explained in the movie , making them almost invisible to everyday viewers .
To “ educated ” viewers , however , those symbols can easily be recognized and placed into context .
Although some of them are not historically accurate or have been modified to make them “ fictional ” , the presence of those themes are in perfect accord with the unprecedented wave of occult symbolism in mass media today .
So let ’s take a look at some of them .
Black Magic Ritual
The movie starts off with Sherlock interrupting a Black Magic ritual .
A hooded man ( Lord Blackwood ) is reciting incantations in front of a woman laid on a sacrificial altar .
The occult theme of the movie is pretty much laid out , right from the start .
Order Out of Chaos
In a seemingly trivial scene , a slightly “ altered on morphine ” Sherlock plays violin notes to flies in a tube .
He explains to Watson his discovery : when he plays atonal clusters to the flies , they synchronize and start flying in concentric circles .
Thus , using musical theory , he has created order out of chaos .
“ Ordo ab Chao ” ( which is translated to English to Order Out of Chaos ) is probably the most famous Masonic maxim .
Mackey ’s encyclopedia documents the use of this phrase since 1395 as the official motto of the Ancient Craft Masonry .
“ Ordo ab Chao ” is now the official motto of the highest and honorary degree of Scottish Rite Masonry , the 33rd degree .
Some occult researchers claim that the saying refers to the elite ’s propensity to create crises which generate fear and confusion in the masses ( chaos ) in order to introduce new policies and laws that are favorable to them ( order ) .
The “ pièce of résitance ” would be the creation of a New World Order lead by the occult elite after a period of generalized chaos , which would be of their creation .
In this context , can Sherlock ’s insects fly in concentric circles represent the masses hypnotized by the New World Order ’s atonal notes ?
Blackwood ’s Cell
When Sherlock visits Lord Blackwood at his prison cell , he notices strange engravings on the walls .
One of them stands out :
This symbol of a crucified rose is considered to be the first symbol representing the Rosicrucian Order , a hermetic brotherhood dating from the Middle - Ages .
Was Lord Blackwood a Rosicrucian ?
“ Rosicrucians , a name assumed by a sect or cabal of hermetical philosophers ; who arose , as it has been said , or at least became first taken notice of in Germany , in the beginning of the fourteenth century .
They bound themselves together by a solemn secret , which they all swore inviolably to preserve : and obliged themselves , at their admission into the order , to a strict observance of certain established rules .
They pretended to know all sciences , and chiefly medicine : whereof they published themselves the restorers .
They pretended to be masters of abundance of important secrets , and , among others , that of the philosopher ’s stone : all which they affirmed to have received by tradition from the ancient
Egyptians , Chaldeans , the Magi , and Gymnosophists .
They have been distinguished by several names , accommodated to the several branches of their doctrine .
Because they pretend to protect the period of human life , by means of certain nostrums , and even to restore youth , they were called Immortals ; as they pretended to know all things , they have been called Illuminati ; and because they have made no appearance for several years , unless the sect of Illuminated which lately started up on the continent derives its origin from them , they have been called the Invisible Brothers . ”
– Enc. Brit. , 3rd Edition , Vol. 16 , 1797
Some researchers have claimed that the Rosicrucians had “ taken over ” Freemasonry during the beginning of the 18th century .
It has played an important , yet secretive role in the shaping of today ’s world .
The Lab
When Sherlock and Watson inspect “ The Dwarf ’s ” lab for clues , some interesting symbols are engraved on the wall .
The detectives discover that the lab seems to mix advanced science with occultism .
Another interesting symbol is found on a wall .
“ The Tree of the Sephiroth may be considered an invaluable compendium of the secret philosophy which originally was the spirit and soul of Chasidism .
The Qabbalah is the priceless heritage of Israel , but each year those who comprehend its true principles become fewer in number .
The Jew of today , if he lacks a realization of the profundity of his people ’s doctrines , is usually permeated with that most dangerous form of ignorance , modernism , and is prone to regard the Qabbalah either as an evil to be shunned like the plague or as a ridiculous superstition which has survived the black magic of the Dark Ages .
Yet without the key which the Qabbalah supplies , the spiritual mysteries of both the Old and the New Testament must remain unsolved by Jew and Gentile alike .
The Sephirothic
Tree consists of ten globes of luminous splendor arranged in three vertical columns and connected by 22 channels or paths .
The ten globes are called the Sephiroth and to them are assigned the numbers i to 10 .
The three columns are called Mercy ( on the right ) , Severity ( on the left ) , and , between them , Mildness , as the reconciling power .
The columns may also be said to represent Wisdom , Strength , and Beauty , which form the triune support of the universe , for it is written that the foundation of all things is the Three .
The 22 channels are the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and to them are assigned the major trumps of the Tarot deck of symbolic cards . ”
– Manly P. Hall , Secret Teachings of All Ages
Blackwood ’s Spellbook
After being summoned by “ The Order ” , Sherlock is told that Blackwood ’s spell book is the key to stop him .
This spellbook contains some symbols that might be recognizable to readers of this site .
The creature in the middle looks remarkably like Baphomet .
Here ’s the next page of Lord Blackwood ’s spellbook :
This image is heavily inspired by an engraving of French occultist Stanislas de Guaita , which can be found in the 1897 book La Clef de la Magie Noire ( The Key to Black Magic ) :
The Order
In Sherlock Holmes , The Order is an occult brotherhood that can easily be compared to the “ real world ” Freemasonry .
It is said in the movie that their “ secret system has stirred the world towards the greater good for centuries , but it can also be used for more nefarious purposes … the Dark Arts or practical magic ” .
The Order has many members in government and police .
Blackwood , a practitioner of Black Magic , takes over The Order by force , claiming that he has a “ magnificent purpose ” : to create a new future , a future ruled by the Brotherhood .
Later in the movie , Blackwood says “ The new order … begins now ” , which is a reference to the New World Order ushered in by the Illuminati that is said to be taking place today .
Blackwood ’s takeover of The Order probably refers to the take over of Freemasonry by German Illuminism and Rosicrucianism during the 18th century , which drastically changed some of its doctrines and lead to its worldwide spread .
So , here ’s the major spoiler :
All of this occult , magical stuff turned out to be trickery that Sherlock explained with logic and science .
So , after the viewers are exposed to the symbols and the Brotherhood , they are told that these things are fiction , and even rather ridiculous .
This is kind of surprising , considering that director Guy Richie was married to Qabbalah adept Madonna .
Further , the occultism presented in the movie is rather dark , threatening and borderline satanic , which can encourage viewers to associate everything occult with evil , which is not the case .
In a rather ominous final scene , Sherlock describes a machine that could exist in 2010 : “ Imagine a device able to control anybody simply by saying a command using radio waves … it ’s the future ” .
HAARP anyone ?
To Conclude
Although the occult elements of the movie are presented as being fictional products of director Guy Richie ’s imagination , many of the symbols used are taken from actual occult works .
There is no doubt that some research has been done in order to give the movie some “ occult authenticity ” , but it seems to go further than this .
There is a certain cohesiveness in the symbols used , which makes them more than decorative additions , but rather a series of clues pointing towards actual Secret Societies .
Were they placed for “ those in the know ” as a sort of cryptographic message or insider ’s joke ?
Did the director want the viewers to play Sherlock Holmes ?
These symbols mean one thing for sure :
We are witnessing a definite “ occultization ” of mass media .
A Fox News legal analyst says the ACORN employee who last week filed a lawsuit against two filmmakers who secretly recorded her has a strong case .
In a heated discussion on Fox & Friends , former prosecutor Arthur Aidala told host Gretchen Carlson that , under Pennsylvania law , it is illegal to record someone without their knowledge .
He also said that because the filmmakers were there ostensibly to get financial advice , ACORN staff had a reasonable expectation of privacy that the filmmakers violated .
ADVERTISEMENT
Asked by Carlson if Katherine Conway - Russell the ACORN employee who filed the suit , had a case , Aidala said “ absolutely . ”
“ Pennsylvania has a law .
You cannot do exactly what they did , ” Aidala said .
“ I can not come into your office … have a secret recording of a confidential conversation with you , and then disseminate it .
I am in clear violation of Pennsylvania law . ”
James O’Keefe and Hannah Giles , who posed as a pimp and prostitute and recorded themselves receiving advice from ACORN staff last summer , are facing a civil suit in a Philadelphia courtroom over their recording of a July , 2009 , meeting at the ACORN office in that city .
Conway - Russell , the ACORN employee who met with O’Keefe and Giles , says she never gave them advice on any illegal matter , and asked them to leave the office when their questions became “ suspicious . ”
“ Unlike the videos [ O ’ Keefe ] has been showing on the Internet , we refused to help him and called the police and filed this report , ” Conway - Russell says in a video produced by ACORN ( see below ) .
Conway - Russell says the filmmaker duo asked questions about getting help with an election campaign and buying a home , and “ then the questions got strange . …
They asked about bringing girls from El Salvador and getting them papers , etc .
I told them that there was nothing we could do to help them , that I did n’t know anything about what they were asking .
I emphasized that ACORN is a counsel agency , that we educate people on the steps of buying a home .
I then told them they had to leave , that I had other things I needed to do . ”

Conway - Russell says that after the meeting , she contacted other ACORN offices and discovered they had also been visited by O’Keefe and Giles .
One of the other employees then contacted the police , she says in the video .
“ I do n’t know what happened in the other offices , ” Conway - Russell says .
“ But in our case , it appears Mr. O’Keefe lied to get his appointment .
He was not dressed like he was on the Internet [ like a pimp ] .
And when we got suspicious about the questions he was asking … we called the police and filed this report . ”
On Fox & Friends , Aidala argued that ACORN ’s lawsuit was strong because it involved “ a confidential conversation for both parties , because people are going in there disclosing all their financial needs , so ACORN ca n’t talk about what they ’re saying . ”

But former defense attorney Tom Kenneth argued that ACORN offices are , in effect , public places and ACORN employees do n’t have a reasonable expectation of privacy .
The difference is crucial because under Pennsylvania law , it is illegal to videotape a conversation if the person being videotaped does n’t know about it , and has a “ reasonable expectation ” of privacy .
This is the second lawsuit in which ACORN or its employees have alleged wrongdoing against O’Keefe and Giles .
Last fall , ACORN filed a similar suit with a Maryland court over the filmmakers ’ recording of ACORN ’s Baltimore office .
Maryland ’s laws on secret recording of conversations are similar to Pennsylvania’s .

One of the most persistent myths about Windows is that you need to reinstall the operating system regularly to keep it running at top performance .
Let 's take a look at the real problem and how to fix it .

Today we 're talking about the myth that Windows slows down over time , and how to solve the problem .
The reality is that Windows does n't slow down if you just take care of your PC a little more .
Follow these procedures , and you wo n't have to wonder if spending hours backing up data , installing from disc , and re-installing your essential applications is really necessary .
What Does Slow Windows Down Over Time ?
I 'm not going to sit here and tell you that your Windows PC will never slow down — because for many people , they almost always do .
What actually slows your PC down are too many poorly written applications that stay resident in memory and waste CPU cycles , having too many badly written low - level applications that hook into Windows , or running more than one antivirus application at a time .
And of course , if you 've run your PC's hard drive out of space , you can hardly blame Windows for that .

If you are n't getting the picture , the problem is usually the person behind the keyboard that installed too many junk applications in the first place .
More gently put , it 's often that ( very well - meaning ) person 's gradual easing of their safeguards and cleaning regimens as time goes by .
Stop Installing Junk Applications
Installing software should be thought of like feeding your PC .
If you constantly feed your PC garbage apps , it 's going to get sick and wo n't be able to run fast anymore .
These poorly written applications clutter your drive with unnecessary DLL files , add always - resident Windows services when they do n't need to , bloat up your registry , and add useless icons to your system tray that waste even more memory and CPU cycles .
Usually you can get away with using a few terrible applications , but as you continue to install more and more of them , your PC will slow down to a crawl .

We feature and recommend a lot of software applications around here , but you should keep in mind that we are n't trying to tell you to install every single one of them at the same time - just install the applications that you actually need and you 'll generally prevent the dreaded format and reinstall .
Here 's a few tips to help you know what applications you should be careful with :
Apps that function as an Explorer plug - in , because they directly hook into the shell and any problem will make your entire PC slow or in the worst case , crash repeatedly .

Keep Your Computer Clean and Trim

Once you 've rid yourself of your junk application habit and resolved to only use healthy , useful applications , you 'll want to make sure to keep your PC clean of any remaining clutter that does n't need to be there .
You can set up a shortcut to manually run CCleaner silently with the push of a button , but your best bet is to set up CCleaner to run automatically on a schedule , so you do n't have to remember to do it .
Since CCleaner is only going to clean up temporary files , you 'll still need a good solution for keeping the rest of your PC clean - and Lifehacker 's own Belvedere can help you automate your self - cleaning PC or automatically clean up your download folder .

With all of this automated file deletion going on , your hard drive is likely to get a bit fragmented .
If you 're already running Windows 7 or Vista , automatic defrag comes out of the box and probably should n't be messed with , but Windows XP users will need to use Windows Tasks to setup a schedule and automatically defrag their drives .

Use a Virtual Machine or Sandbox to Test Software
Advertisement
If you still want to test out all of the latest software , including apps that look a bit rough around the edges , your best bet is to use a virtual machine to test out anything before putting it onto your primary operating system .
You can install all of your software in an XP or Windows 7 VM just like it was a real PC , and with the latest VMWare player releases , you can even enable Windows Aero in a guest VM .
If you are new to the idea and need some more help , you should check out our beginner 's guide to creating virtual machines in VirtualBox , or Windows 7 users can check out our guide to using XP Mode .
If you do n't want to go the virtual machine route , Windows XP and Vista users can alternatively use Windows SteadyState to protect their PC and roll back all of the changes on a reboot .

Radar image of the Port - au - Prince area .
Red arrows show direction of movement of tectonic plates .
( Jet Propulsion Laboratory )
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The earthquake that struck Haiti took place along what is called a strike - slip fault -- a place where tectonic plates on each side of a fault line are moving horizontally in opposite directions , like hands rubbing together .
When these plates lock together , stress builds ; eventually they slip ; and this produces shaking .
This quake was fairly shallow ; it involved compression of the plates directly against each other as well as sliding ; and it occurred near the densely populated capital of Port - au - Prince .
This is a deadly combination , but large , sudden movement was not the only thing ; because buildings in this impoverished country were not made to withstand heavy shaking , the destruction was extraordinary .
Below , Arthur Lerner - Lam , head of the division of seismology , geology and tectonophsyics at Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory , discusses details quake physics and what might happen next .
How powerful was this event ?
Magnitude 7.0 on the Richter scale is the measurement used in the official U.S. Geological Survey summary .
However , seismologists use different ways of measuring magnitude for these very large events .
You may see references to a “ moment magnitude . ”
On that scale , this one is estimated at 7.1 .
Technically , this is a more accurate measure and is closely related to other measures of earthquake strength , such as its slip ( movement of crust ) , and the length of the rupture .
Each magnitude increase means an earthquake shakes the ground with 10 times more the amount , or amplitude , than the next lower number .
So , an M7 is 10 times shakier than an M6 .
But the relationship between amplitude and energy means that an M7 is actually 30 times more energetic than an M6 .
Where did it occur ?
The epicenter , or the point on the earth ’s surface above the nucleation of the event , was about 25 kilometers , or 15 miles , southwest of Port - au - Prince .
When you add depth - 13 kilometers , or 8.1 miles — you have the “ hypocenter . ”
However , large earthquakes are not point phenomena : they rupture a fault with a measurable length and width .
Though final measurements have not yet been made , this rupture is probably about 75 kilometers ( 30 miles ) in length and 13 - 15 kilometers in width .
We estimate this in the early days from the distribution of aftershocks and measurements of complexities in recordings of the earthquake from nearby seismometers .
Tectonic plates and fault zones of the Caribbean .
Port - au - Prince is the red star .
( After P. Molnar / L.R. Sykes , “ Tectonics of the Caribbean , ” 1969 )
Were there warning signs , and will there be signs of future danger ?
A global system of seismic instruments run by many institutions routinely detects sizable quakes anywhere .
But there are no such stations in Haiti , and not even any local system there .
So , there have almost certainly been many small events near Port - au - Prince both before and after the big quake , but they have not been picked up .
The closest seismometers are reporting from the Dominican Republic , Jamaica and other nearby countries .
That said , no matter how many instruments you have , scientists still do not yet have a reliable way to predict the timing of an earthquake .
In this case , there was no evidence of precursory activity that could have delivered a short - term warning .
How frequent are aftershocks , and how dangerous are they ?
Once there is a big quake , the earth keeps rearranging itself for a while , so there is heightened risk of more , smaller quakes in following weeks , months and even years .
Typically , as time goes by , the intensity and frequency taper off .
There were 45 aftershocks in just the first three days with a magnitude of more than 4.5 .
The largest four had magnitudes ranging from 5.5 to 5.9 , and all occurred in the first eight hours after the main shock .
The biggest one so far — magnitude 6.1 - hit a week after the main shock and caused panic all over again .
There will be more .
What do we know about faults around here ?
The existence of dangerous faults in this region is not a surprise .
Published studies have documented their locations , and strain building on them .
This earthquake came along a fault that forms part of the boundary between the Caribbean plate ( to the south ) and the North American plate ( to the north ) .
Relative to North America , the Caribbean plate moves east at about 20 millimeters a year , or slightly less than an inch .
This is about half of the rate of motion between the plates that underlie California .
However , this motion is divided among at least two and probably three major faults , running east - west .
The main shock occurred on part of what is known as the Enriquillo - Plantain Gardens fault , which follows the peninsula of southern Haiti , then continues offshore westward to Jamaica .
Recent measurements show that it is building up strain at about 7 millimeters a year .
The other major one is the Septentrional fault , running parallel to the Enriquillo along the northern side of the island of Hispanola ( which Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic ) .
The Septentrional continues westward to the southern coast of Cuba .
Well - developed strike - slip faults often “ lock ” in place , with little evidence of activity except for large earthquakes that occur several hundred years apart .
The system around this region has not been totally inactive ; it has seen dozens of earthquakes of at least magnitude 5 since 1964 .
But the last big one we know of on the Enriquillo fault was in the late 1700s .
The Northern Caribbean has been hit by many quakes greater than magnitude 5 since 1964 .
Blue circles show the shallowest , within 25 kilometers of the surface .
Gray circles show immediate aftershocks from the Jan. 12 , 2010 , quake .
( Geoffrey Abers / Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory )
Is there danger to the Dominican Republic or other nearby countries ?
The fault appeared to rupture to the west , starting from the hypocenter , away from the Dominican Republic .
The Enriquillo fault does indeed continue to the east , though there is some question as to how far .
The relative motion of the plates is transferred to the northern branch of this fault system , along the northern coast of the Dominican Republic .
The Dominican Republic has been struck by large earthquakes in the past , but not this time ; shaking is generally greater closer to the rupture .
More generally , though , there are often interactions among such closely spaced faults , which can trigger new earthquakes .
One of the questions being addressed now is whether the sudden release of stress in the Haiti earthquake has adversely affected other faults in the region , which may hasten the occurrence of another earthquake along those faults .
This kind of triggering has been observed along the North Anatolia Fault in Turkey in 1999 , in Sumatra in 2004 - 2005 , and elsewhere .
There ’s speculation that this happened along the Enriquillo fault in the late 18th century , though definitive geological mapping has not yet been done .
Why was damage so great ; ca n’t places like Haiti be made less vulnerable ?
A strike - slip earthquake produces lots of lateral shaking , and that is very damaging to buildings .
Strike - slip faults also produce shallow earthquakes , which are more damaging simply because they are closer to the surface , where people live .
But the earthquake itself is only part of the answer .
This was roughly similar to the 1989 quake that hit the San Francisco area while the World Series was going on .
There , only several dozen people died .
Much of the difference can be attributed to construction practices .
Haiti is very poor , and had a lot of weak buildings , sitting on soft soils .
That is a disastrous combination .
This is not a new lesson .
Plenty is known about how to build strong buildings , but application of this knowledge is of course problematic in less developed countries .
Attention is now being paid to saving lives and providing the immediate necessities of water , food , medicine and temporary housing .
Haiti is exposed to other hazards , including hurricanes and landslides — and we have to watch out for landslides triggered by aftershocks , especially if it rains in the coming days .
But the long - term rebuilding program - perhaps decades long - must try to use best practices , fine tuned to Haitian society .
“ Multihazard resilience ” is a touchstone concept for developing countries .
Resilience is as much a statement of civic and cultural strengths as it is a reflection of a well - built infrastructure .

RITE AND REASON : “ Paul ” , who suffered clerical sex abuse , explains why he believes the Catholic Church has failed properly to deal with the problem in its midst
I AM writing because I know why the church hid the abusers and is still evasive about blaming the perpetrators and the people who hid them .
Naturally I am a victim , so I am limited by the anger I feel , but also it seems I am unique in remembering the most important aspect of it all , the aspect that explains everything .
My priest ( abuser ) has the distinction of being the highest placed individual that I am aware of as having been accused .
He is dead many years .
I want to remain anonymous because I do not want a label attached to myself .
Understand , I am not ashamed in any way , but that is not who I am and I do n’t want all my actions or inactions explained away with reference to the abuse I experienced .
The reason why the church covered up the abuse and moved priests about is because they did not blame the priests , they blamed the children .
With this knowledge observe the reaction of church authorities .
They look as if they would like to say it , but can’t .
And that is it .
They ca n’t because they believe society is now over - sentimental about children and they would not be understood .
This was confirmed to me when I met an old priest tucked away in a nursing home despite the fact he was not unwell .
At one point he suggested Cardinal Ó Fiaich should be canonised , I rejected the idea , pointing out he was involved in the cover - up of abuse .
The old priest said : “ People should forgive him , after all we are prepared to forgive the children . ”
I asked : “ Forgive the children what ? ”
He replied : “ Their share of the blame . ”
Of course in that moment I realised he was himself an abuser , hidden away there .
In my own case the priest treated the abuse as punishment for some contrived wrongdoing by me .
Afterwards he would recoil , claiming that I was the cause of it and he was merely a weak sinner who had been tempted by me .
You can see ; firstly , the damage this would do to the child , ( the child is unlikely to report it as the child has been led to believe that he / she is to blame ) and , secondly , you can also see the moral get - out clause this gives the priest and the church .
They see themselves as the victims and everything that has happened , up to and including the Murphy report , is part of the attack that these Devil - inspired , tempter children have been responsible for in their attempts to destroy the church .
Every victim who then claims against the church is simply acting in the role in which they have been cast .
Having tempted the poor , weak priest into sin they then add insult to injury by trying to destroy the church by attempting to steal its money .
With this logic in mind everything falls into place .
The problem is not a legal or a moral one , it is spiritual .
This explains their moving the priests on ; giving them a fresh start ; and pleading that “ lots of prayer will help you ” .
And when they offend again , they will have been preyed upon by another agent of the Devil in child form .
Of course this is all self - deluding rubbish .
It is a product of a “ closed society ” which has drifted into a terrible place because it has no outside agency ( such as the law ) to regulate it .
All closed societies are dangerous for this reason .
Furthermore , we are dealing with an organisation that still retains medieval beliefs .
It may play them down ( exorcism for example ) but they are still on the books and inform the day - to - day running of the church .
I believe strongly that the church , despite all its mistakes , was a major contributor to the stabilisation of western civilisation .
But that day has passed .
Law and constitutional democracy have superseded the need for the rules the church enforced .

To use the tattoo database , detectives can enter either words or images they believe may be in the tattoo .
A search request can also include the part of the body that bears the tattoo .
The phrase “ I love ” comes back 596 times .
Dozens of people have “ I love Mom ” tattooed on their arms .
One person has “ Chi - Chi I love you . ”
Another has “ Dollar Bills I love Money ” tattooed on a hand .
Then there is the New Yorker whose affection , perhaps for a former mayor , has been duly recorded : “ I love Rudy . ”
A search for the word “ kill ” in a tattoo produces 72 hits .
Two people have the tattoos “ Kill all rats . ”
Others say “ ambition is a killer ” and “ kill cops . ”
Investigators sometimes struggle to identify tattoos , said Sgt. Kevin C. Lonergan , who works at the crime center .
“ Jailhouse tattoos , tribal tattoos , those are sometimes hard to write down descriptions for because either we do n’t know what they are or what they mean , ” Sergeant Lonergan said .
“ Asian symbols are easier . ”
The Police Department does not keep arrest reports when criminal cases have been dropped , said Paul .
J. Browne , its chief spokesman .
Nevertheless , the use of such databases has raised some questions about whether the department tracks too much information .
The New York Civil Liberties Union , for example , has criticized the department ’s use of technology to collect data on people , regardless of their backgrounds .
It has , for instance , questioned how the department handles images picked up by surveillance cameras and how that information is cataloged and stored .

One of Winston Churchill 's lesser - known achievements is the setting up of labour exchanges , more recently known as job centres , 100 years ago .
They are almost unrecognisable from those days , but how do these changes reflect evolving social attitudes ?
Before 1910 , the jobless had to hang around outside the factory or shipyards , relying on rumour and hearsay to find work .
Or if they were really desperate , head to the workhouse .
Dawn of a new era in job seeking - the launch of the Labour Exchange in 1910
But that all changed when as part of a series of reforms tackling poverty , 62 labour exchanges opened their doors on 1 February of that year .
Unemployment was rising at the beginning of the 20th Century and the ill - fated Boer War had engendered a crisis of confidence in the health of Britain 's workforce .
Winston Churchill , appointed as President of the Board of Trade in 1908 when he was a Liberal MP , was given the task of solving the problem .
He immediately started drafting a new social programme that included Labour Exchanges and unemployment insurance .
WHY IN 1910 ?
A study by Seebohm Rowntree had found previously undiscovered levels of poverty Two - thirds of Boer War recruits had been unfit to join up
There were fears that Germany , with a more advanced welfare state , was overtaking Britain
The newly founded Labour Party was attracting working class votes Trade unionism was gaining in strength so there were fears that unrest could stoke communism
The groundwork had been done by a young William Beveridge , whose report on deprivation decades later led to the founding of the modern welfare state .
The exchanges were set up in offices , factories , shops , chapels and other locations , evident from the queues of people , some as young as 11 , snaking down the street .
They were painted green and contained separate rooms for men , women , employers and children .
At the Shoreditch office in London , vacancies on the first day included a piano regulator and picture frame gilder .
In nearby Camberwell , and in an era when sexual discrimination in the workplace was n't even a consideration , there was a job for a " girl confectioner 's packer " .
" The initial scheme was part of a particularly radical , free - thinking element of the Liberal Party , " says Derek Fraser , author of The Evolution of the British Welfare State .
" Lloyd George and Churchill were rivals for the leadership of the radical wing of the party .
This was one plank in a broad social policy trying to deal with the consequences of industrialisation . "
Conscription agencies
They were also trying to outflank the infant Labour Party , and reach out to ordinary working people , says Mr Fraser , a professor of history at the University of Teesside .
Rebranded in the early 70s and sited , for convenience , on High Streets " Beveridge had identified the fluidity of the labour market and the intervals between periods of employment that labour exchanges could help to plug . "
What was important was that they were removed from the workhouses set up under the 19th Century Poor Laws , which were so stigmatised that people only went to them when in extreme distress .
" Labour exchanges had a different set of values , that did not describe people as deserving or undeserving - if you paid your national insurance then you got benefits . "
But the first exchanges had little impact because unemployment was falling in the build - up to war , says social historian Noel Whiteside , and the unions were controlling the skilled jobs .
" The exchanges were left with the unskilled end of the labour market .
If employers were looking for skilled workers they did n't turn to labour exchanges . "
But war itself gave them a relevance that had been unanticipated - in both the World Wars I and II the labour exchanges became agencies for military conscription , she says .
They registered the men who were heading off to fight , and regulated the women who replaced them .
Orange and black
And in peace time , post 1918 , they took on a deeply unpopular role - testing people for their suitability for work .
Labour Exchange staff would even inspect the family home to assess the family income .
A Jobcentre ' library ' - the idea was to make the centres less intimidating
It was the early 70s , when , after years of growing prosperity , Britain 's economy began to waver and unemployment started to creep up , that the Labour Exchange became the subjected of a major rebranding exercise .
In 1973 , they were renamed Jobcentres and began cropping up on High Streets , complete with a highly conspicuous orange and black decor .
But the more user - friendly appearance could n't pacify a growing hostility in some quarters towards Jobcentres and the belief they were a sticking plaster on the open wound of growing unemployment .
" The new branding dates from the 1970s but because of high unemployment [ in the 1980s ] of three million , there was a lot of hostility about welfare dependency and the thought that people could get a job if they picked themselves up .
It was still stigmatised .
WHAT WERE THEY LIKE IN THE 60s ?
" At the Portsmouth office there was a separate section for women , " says Barry Burton , pictured now and in the 1960s .
" Offices were smoky , smelly and very crowded as there were no appointments and unemployment was high .
" A normal pay day consisted of a long queue to sign followed by another long queue to receive any benefit payments .
Could be well over an hour in total per person so personal hygiene or lack of was noticeable particular on a hot day .
" Big high wooden old fashion counters greeted those receiving benefits , which separated customers from staff .
No vacancies on display - employment officers kept them all on a card in a desk drawer and would choose which ones to offer clients . "
" The design of public buildings can tell you a lot about their function .
From the austere , bleak , almost Soviet - style buildings , in some cases complete with fences between officers and clients because of fear of physical assault , people were viewed as morally suspect for claiming benefits . "
Alan Bleasdale 's TV series The Boys From The Blackstuff , in which protagonist Yosser Hughes immortalised the phrase " Gissa job " , reinforced this image .
But in the past 15 to 20 years , says Mr Fraser , they have become open , modern offices that look more like banks ; places with a professional and user - friendly service .
The centres have also been combined with benefits offices to create the brand Jobcentre Plus .
Advent of carpets
When " unemployment benefit " was itself rebranded into the less judgmental JobSeeker 's Allowance , the rehabilitation was complete .
The glossy , Jobcentre Plus branding familiar today Barry Burton , 64 , followed in his father 's footsteps when he began working in the Portsmouth Labour Exchange in 1966 .
He has witnessed the changing face of job centres first hand .
" There were no job adverts , so people had to ask officers if there was a vacancy in their preferred field .
If you had an open mind about what you wanted to do you were disadvantaged , " recalls Mr Burton .
" It 's a nice place to come into now .
The offices were very scruffy and poorly decorated and when carpets and modern furniture were introduced there were concerns that clients would damage them , but the reaction was favourable and this encouraged further improvements in making jobcentres more attractive .
" In the 70s , they started to make a real effort in appearances and better clients started to come in .
Some were already in work and wanted a new job , so we had late night openings and Saturday mornings .
The places looked more appealing to people .
The cards came out too , so people could browse for jobs . "
Mr Burton found his role rewarding , but not without its difficulties .
" It 's difficult when you really want to help people and you can't always produce the job they want , but it 's very satisfying when you do that , and sometimes they come back to say thank you . "

As someone who become an unwilling frequent visitor to Jobcentre Plus due to the recent climate I found this arcticle very interesting .
In future Id like to see Jobcentres offering ; proper career advice , guidance on benefits and filling out forms and a good range of back - to - work schemes .
Dave , Huddersfield , UK A " professional and user - friendly service " Really ?
Perhaps too professional - given how many people they have to deal with it 's all too easy for staff to treat jobseekers as numbers rather than real people .
Little actual help was given to me except to destroy any ambitions I had as a new graduate .
The trip to the jobcentre to sign on was the most depressing time of the week while I was unemployed three years ago .
Lois , York I worked in the Benefits Agency before it was merged with the Jobcentre to become Jobcentre Plus , but I transferred to another civil service department before the open - plan office was implemented because I just was n't comfortable with it .
The Benefits Agency receptionists had to call the police out at least on a weekly basis ; on one occasion armed police had to be called .
Open - plan works for job searching but not for when giving bad news to the 1 % of benefit customers who are potentially violent .
I still believe the two should not have been put together , and tales from a friend of the family who has worked in Jobcentre Plus since the early pilots just reinforce I made the right move .
Michaela , Runcorn , UK How is jobseekers ' allowance the less judgemental version ?
It tells you that if and only if you 're not feckless and idle , you will be patronisingly granted pocket money .
Unemployment benefit , on the other hand , is exactly what it says on the tin - I was out of work for a year , and one of the reasons I never went near a jobcentre was the humiliating name of the funding I would have to sign up to .
Charlie Grove , London
When I joined the Jobcentre Service in 1978 it was a key part of a combined service dealing with the majority of vacancies in the country .
We had two specialist services ; the Professional and Executive Recruitment , which charged for its services , while the Occupational Guidance Unit provided specialist advice to people who had either been longer term unemployed or who simply were uncertain what area their skills were suitable for .
In common with many other government departments , we suffered a series of re-organisations , in our case bringing us closer or further away from others working in the area of employment , unemployment and training .
We had a wide mixture of people we were trying to help , including some referred from the Benefit Offices .
I 've almost lost count of how many different iterations of departmental names and responsibilities we went through in the 10 years or so that I worked in jobcentes , but it included the Manpower Services Commission , Employment Services Agency and Employment Division .

Perceived Risk vs. Actual Risk
I ’ve written repeatedly about the difference between perceived and actual risk , and how it explains many seemingly perverse security trade - offs .
Here ’s a Los Angeles Times op - ed that does the same .
The author is Daniel Gilbert , psychology professor at Harvard .
( I just recently finished his book Stumbling on Happiness , which is not a self - help book but instead about how the brain works .
Strongly recommended . )
The op - ed is about the public ’s reaction to the risks of global warming and terrorism , but the points he makes are much more general .
He gives four reasons why some risks are perceived to be more or less serious than they actually are :
We over - react to intentional actions , and under - react to accidents , abstract events , and natural phenomena .
That ’s why we worry more about anthrax ( with an annual death toll of roughly zero ) than influenza ( with an annual death toll of a quarter - million to a half - million people ) .
Influenza is a natural accident , anthrax is an intentional action , and the smallest action captures our attention in a way that the largest accident does n’t .
If two airplanes had been hit by lightning and crashed into a New York skyscraper , few of us would be able to name the date on which it happened .
We over - react to things that offend our morals .
When people feel insulted or disgusted , they generally do something about it , such as whacking each other over the head , or voting .
Moral emotions are the brain ’s call to action .
He does n’t say it , but it ’s reasonable to assume that we under - react to things that do n’t .
We over - react to immediate threats and under - react to long - term threats .
The brain is a beautifully engineered get - out - of - the - way machine that constantly scans the environment for things out of whose way it should right now get .
That ’s what brains did for several hundred million years — and then , just a few million years ago , the mammalian brain learned a new trick : to predict the timing and location of dangers before they actually happened .
Our ability to duck that which is not yet coming is one of the brain ’s most stunning innovations , and we would n’t have dental floss or 401 ( k ) plans without it .
But this innovation is in the early stages of development .
The application that allows us to respond to visible baseballs is ancient and reliable , but the add - on utility that allows us to respond to threats that loom in an unseen future is still in beta testing .
We under - react to changes that occur slowly and over time .
The human brain is exquisitely sensitive to changes in light , sound , temperature , pressure , size , weight and just about everything else .
But if the rate of change is slow enough , the change will go undetected .
If the low hum of a refrigerator were to increase in pitch over the course of several weeks , the appliance could be singing soprano by the end of the month and no one would be the wiser .
It ’s interesting to compare this to what I wrote in Beyond Fear ( pages 26 - 27 ) about perceived vs. actual risk :
People exaggerate spectacular but rare risks and downplay common risks .
They worry more about earthquakes than they do about slipping on the bathroom floor , even though the latter kills far more people than the former .
Similarly , terrorism causes far more anxiety than common street crime , even though the latter claims many more lives .
Many people believe that their children are at risk of being given poisoned candy by strangers at Halloween , even though there has been no documented case of this ever happening .
People have trouble estimating risks for anything not exactly like their normal situation .
Americans worry more about the risk of mugging in a foreign city , no matter how much safer it might be than where they live back home .
Europeans routinely perceive the U.S. as being full of guns .
Men regularly underestimate how risky a situation might be for an unaccompanied woman .
The risks of computer crime are generally believed to be greater than they are , because computers are relatively new and the risks are unfamiliar .
Middle - class Americans can be particularly naïve and complacent ; their lives are incredibly secure most of the time , so their instincts about the risks of many situations have been dulled .
Personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks .
Joseph Stalin said , “ A single death is a tragedy , a million deaths is a statistic . ”
He was right ; large numbers have a way of blending into each other .
The final death toll from 9/11 was less than half of the initial estimates , but that did n’t make people feel less at risk .
People gloss over statistics of automobile deaths , but when the press writes page after page about nine people trapped in a mine — complete with human - interest stories about their lives and families — suddenly everyone starts paying attention to the dangers with which miners have contended for centuries .
Osama bin Laden represents the face of Al Qaeda , and has served as the personification of the terrorist threat .
Even if he were dead , it would serve the interests of some politicians to keep him “ alive ” for his effect on public opinion .
People underestimate risks they willingly take and overestimate risks in situations they can’t control .
When people voluntarily take a risk , they tend to underestimate it .
When they have no choice but to take the risk , they tend to overestimate it .
Terrorists are scary because they attack arbitrarily , and from nowhere .
Commercial airplanes are perceived as riskier than automobiles , because the controls are in someone else ’s hands — even though they ’re much safer per passenger mile .
Similarly , people overestimate even more those risks that they can’t control but think they , or someone , should .
People worry about airplane crashes not because we can’t stop them , but because we think as a society we should be capable of stopping them ( even if that is not really the case ) .
While we ca n’t really prevent criminals like the two snipers who terrorized the Washington , DC , area in the fall of 2002 from killing , most people think we should be able to .
Last , people overestimate risks that are being talked about and remain an object of public scrutiny .
News , by definition , is about anomalies .
Endless numbers of automobile crashes hardly make news like one airplane crash does .
The West Nile virus outbreak in 2002 killed very few people , but it worried many more because it was in the news day after day .
AIDS kills about 3 million people per year worldwide — about three times as many people each day as died in the terrorist attacks of 9/11 .
If a lunatic goes back to the office after being fired and kills his boss and two coworkers , it ’s national news for days .
If the same lunatic shoots his ex-wife and two kids instead , it ’s local news … maybe not even the lead story .

With a wide war on terrorism still being fought , an appellate court said Tuesday that Guantanamo Bay prison detainees had few legal rights , so long as the government could show they fought for or actively supported the Taliban or Al Qaeda .
A three - judge panel of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the government ’s broad power to hold indefinitely suspected former Taliban fighters and their supporters who were captured abroad and sent to the U.S. military prison in Cuba .
The decision was the first by the appeals court to interpret what legal rights and rules apply to the Guantanamo detainees who are seeking their freedom through the courts .
Two years ago , the Supreme Court ruled that these long - term prisoners had the right to appeal their detention before a judge , but the justices did not spell out the law that would apply in such hearings .
The appellate judges rejected the claim of Ghaleb Nassar Bihani , a Yemeni native who served as a cook for a Taliban brigade in the fall of 2001 , that he deserved to go free because the U.S. war against the Taliban ended when the Islamist forces surrendered in 2002 .
Judge Janice Rogers Brown said nothing in the law required the release of military prisoners just because the fighting ended in one sector .
The law permits “ what common sense tells us must be true : release is only required when the fighting stops , ” she wrote .
Otherwise , “ each successful campaign of a long war . . . would trigger an obligation to release Taliban fighters captured in earlier clashes ” who could then return to battle .
The judges also rejected the notion that these military prisoners were entitled to the full protections of the criminal law .
For example , Bihani asserted that when he admitted to U.S. military investigators in Afghanistan that he fought alongside the Taliban , his statement should be deemed as “ hearsay ” and not used against him in a federal court hearing in Washington .
But Judge Brown said the habeas corpus hearing was not the same as a criminal trial .
Otherwise , the military investigators from Afghanistan would be required to appear in a court to be cross -examined by the defense lawyers , she said .
“ In a detainee case , the judge acts as a neutral decision maker charged with seizing the actual truth of a simple , binary question : Is detention lawful ? ” she wrote .
“ This is why the one constant in the history of habeas has never been a certain set of procedures , but rather the independent power of a judge to assess the actions of the executive . ”
In this case , U.S. District Judge Richard Leon had decided there was ample evidence to conclude that Bihani had fought with the Taliban .
That was reason enough to uphold his detention , Brown concluded .
Appellate judges Brett Kavanaugh and Stephen Williams joined her in the ruling on Bihani , though Williams said he thought Brown ’s opinion had gone too far on the legal issues .

There is not one universe , but there are many , which is a multiverse .
Supposing you are just one person , there are many other versions of you in the other universes , there are ways to travel , but only a police agency , MVA , can travel only for police procedures .
Gabriel Yulaw is a former MVA agent , who killed another version of himself in self - defense .
It made the other versions of him stronger .
When Yulaw found out about this , he became power - hungry killing the 122 other versions for two years .
After killing Lawless and getting captured by his former partner Roedecker and a new MVA agent Funsch , Yulaw managed to escape the prison and is trying to kill his last target , Gabe Law who is a police officer .
He is also at Yulaw 's strength .
Roedecker and Funsch now have to arrest Yulaw before he can kill Gabe .
There is a possibility that the universe could die or make Yulaw invincible .
After encountering Yulaw for the first time , Gabe thought that it was his split personality , but it was n't .

Overcrowded Train Station in China
When people in China go to vacation , their train stations look like this :
Four U.S. senators have told the chairman of the Washington area ’s subway system — the second largest in the country — that the recent string of accidents is unacceptable and direct federal intervention is possible if he fails to promptly fix the problems .
“ As senators charged with overseeing federal transit policy , we write to express our concern regarding the safety record of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority ’s Metrorail system , ” said the letter from Sens. Christopher J. Dodd , Connecticut Democrat ; Robert Menendez , New Jersey Democrat ; Richard Shelby , Alabama Republican ; and David Vitter , Louisiana Republican .
The letter follows a Feb. 12 derailment of a subway train , which the lawmakers described as the most recent accident in a “ troubling pattern ” of safety incidents involving the Metrorail system .
There have been 17 deaths within the Metrorail system in seven incidents over the past five years .
Nine people were were killed and 80 injured in the agency ’s most deadly accident — a June 2009 crash in which one train struck another from behind .
Five Metrorail employees working on the tracks have been killed in the past year .
“ Such a pattern cannot be viewed as a string of isolated accidents , ” says the letter to Metro Chairman Peter Benjamin .
“ Rather , it is clear that there is an institutional failure on the part of WMATA .
If these failures cannot be addressed immediately and comprehensively , then we believe that the federal government should consider all possible options to ensure the safety of the Metrorail system , including direct federal intervention . ”
The lawmakers also said they wanted the agency to tell them about long - and short - term plans for ensuring “ riders can once again feel safe and secure using the Metrorail system . ”
Metro spokespeople said the agency plans to meet with the senators to explain how it is trying to improve safety .
The letter was sent Monday , the day before the National Transportation Safety Board holds three days of hearings into the June 22 crash .

' I knew this was a special moment that also humanized the President in a way that people do n’t normally see . '

President Barack Obama bends over so the son of a White House staff member can pat his head during a visit to the Oval Office May 8 , 2009 .
I consider myself one of the luckiest photographers on the planet to be in the position I ’m in : documenting President Obama as his chief official White House photographer .
Rather than choose a “ weighty ” picture , I went with a photograph from what was essentially a grip - and - grin situation to show that you never know when a good photograph may come about .
Carlton Philadelphia was a national security aide temporarily dispatched to the White House for a few months at the start of the administration .
As is customary , when it was time for him to move on , he brought his family into the Oval Office for a quick departure photo with the President .
That ’s all it was supposed to be .
Until his young son shyly and quietly asked the President : I just had my haircut like Barack Obama ; can I feel your head to see if it feels like mine .
The President bent over , and the boy felt his head .
It happened so fast that I only shot one frame .
It was n’t until I looked at it on my computer monitor at the end of the day , that I knew this was a special moment that also humanized the President in a way that people do n’t normally see .
We had already rolled out the first official White House Photo Stream ( www.flickr.com/whitehouse) with regular updates of behind - the - scenes photographs per the administration ’s calling to be more open and transparent .
But I was being very cautious of uploading photos with kids from non-public events .
So we emailed the photo to Mr. Philadelphia , explaining the concept of Flickr and seeking permission to post the photograph .
Yes , he said , he thought it would be good for people to see it .

Astronomer sleuths have solved a cosmic mystery by finding primitive stars that have been stealthily concealed .
Using ESO ’s Very Large Telescope a group of astronomers have uncovered an important astrophysical puzzle concerning the oldest stars in our galactic neighborhood — which is crucial for our understanding of the earliest stars in the Universe . .
“ We have , in effect , found a flaw in the forensic methods used until now , ” said Else Starkenburg , lead author of a paper reporting the new findings .
“ Our improved approach allows us to uncover the primitive stars hidden among all the other , more common stars . ”
Primitive stars are thought to have formed from material forged shortly after the Big Bang , 13.7 billion years ago .
They typically have less than one thousandth the amount of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium found in the Sun and are called “ extremely metal - poor stars . ”
They belong to one of the first generations of stars in the nearby Universe .
Such stars are extremely rare and mainly observed in the Milky Way .
Cosmologists think that larger galaxies like the Milky Way formed from the merger of smaller galaxies .
Our Milky
Way ’s population of extremely metal - poor or “ primitive ” stars should already have been present in the dwarf galaxies from which it formed , and similar populations should be present in other dwarf galaxies .
“ So far , evidence for them has been scarce , ” said co-author Giuseppina Battaglia .
“ Large surveys conducted in the last few years kept showing that the most ancient populations of stars in the Milky Way and dwarf galaxies did not match , which was not at all expected from cosmological models . ”
Element abundances are measured from spectra , which provide the chemical fingerprints of stars .
The Dwarf galaxies Abundances and Radial - velocities Team used the FLAMES instrument on ESO ’s Very Large Telescope to measure the spectra of over 2000 individual giant stars in four of our galactic neighbors , the Fornax , Sculptor , Sextans and Carina dwarf galaxies .
Since the dwarf galaxies are typically 300,000 light years away — which is about three times the size of our Milky Way — only strong features in the spectrum could be measured , like a vague , smeared fingerprint .
The team found that none of their large collection of spectral fingerprints actually seemed to belong to the class of stars they were after , the rare , extremely metal - poor stars found in the Milky Way .
The team of astronomers around Starkenburg has now shed new light on the problem through careful comparison of spectra to computer - based models .
They found that only subtle differences distinguish the chemical fingerprint of a normal metal - poor star from that of an extremely metal - poor star , explaining why previous methods did not succeed in making the identification .
The astronomers also confirmed the almost pristine status of several extremely metal - poor stars thanks to much more detailed spectra obtained with the UVES instrument on ESO ’s Very Large Telescope .
“ Compared to the vague fingerprints we had before , this would be as if we looked at the fingerprint through a microscope , ” explains team member Vanessa Hill .
“ Unfortunately , just a small number of stars can be observed this way because it is very time consuming . ”
“ Among the new extremely metal - poor stars discovered in these dwarf galaxies , three have a relative amount of heavy chemical elements between only 1/3000 and 1/10 000 of what is observed in our Sun , including the current record holder of the most primitive star found outside the Milky Way , ” said team member Martin Tafelmeyer .
“ Not only has our work revealed some of the very interesting , first stars in these galaxies , but it also provides a new , powerful technique to uncover more such stars , ” concluded Starkenburg .
“ From now on there is no place left to hide ! ”

I recently played the PC version of .
The Xbox 360 original released around a year ago , and the PC version , launched in North America late last year , finally hit the UK last week .
The day I spent reviewing it became one of my least favorite of the year so far .is an insane game .
It 's generic and predictable , but you almost suspect it wants to be , and it magnifies those genre quirks into something utterly overblown and ridiculous .
I 'm not really into that anyway , and even without the impenetrable wall of PC - specific problems , I still do n't findto be anything above utterly mediocre .
That 's fine , though - a lot of people will be okay with the game 's approach .
It 's okay for players to disagree over a game 's quality .
Except , I must admit to being completely dumbfounded by the handful of positive reviews this PC version has received .
That 's because , as a PC game , I found it to be borderline unplayable .
With an Xbox 360 pad plugged in , it basically works - aside from a couple of controller glitches here and there .
But to what extent is it acceptable to release a game for one format , while essentially demanding you use the controller from another one ?
Just as a quick guide to what we 're dealing with here : when you create a new save file at the start of Ninja Blade on the PC , it warns you not to " turn off your console . "
Yes , Ninja Blade is one ofconversions : not so much converted as made to perfunctorily run on a different machine .
In - game , you 're asked to press A , B , X and Y in various sequences as part of 's extraordinary abundance of quick - time events .
Whether you have an Xbox 360 pad plugged in or not , the game captions these button icons with text describing the PC equivalent controls .
Only it does n't always do that .
Sometimes , you 're left staring at a giant , pulsating , green letter A , and no idea what to do with it .
It 's true that many PC gamers now have an Xbox 360 pad set on the desk next to their mice and keyboards .
And there are games on the PC that I would never have dreamed of playing without a gamepad.
certainly relies on the ease of combo-chaining that a more traditional PC set - up simply would not be able to provide .
But the PC version ofstill gave you the very reasonable option of playing it with that format 's default control mechanism .
The game remained entirely playable , and the on - screen prompts adjusted depending on which input you 'd opted for .
The latest , for all its quirks , was another hero in this respect , seamlessly altering its instructions and icons the second you plugged in or removed that Xbox 360 pad .
With that pad plugged in , becomes more than playable - and although I have heard reports of controllers glitching and not recognising , I only experienced a couple of minor problems myself .
The game , while uninspired , effectively does work as a game .
It 's fit for purpose .
But , actually , is it ?
That label on the front tells me it 's a PC game .
The minimum system requirements do n't mention an Xbox 360 pad .
I can play it , because I happen to have one , but what if I did n't ?
Would I still be stuck on that first level , trying to work out what on Earth the game meant when it told me to waggle the left stick ?
And would that be my fault for not owning something increasingly widespread in PC gaming , or the fault of those responsible for such a catastrophic port ?
I can't help but feel it 's the latter .
When you 're creating a game for a particular format , it makes absolutely no sense not to optimise it for that format .
And there 's this nagging , though perhaps overly dramatic , voice in my head that says : .
It is described as a game for my PC .
Unless I own a peripheral designed for a different system entirely , one not mentioned in the game 's accompanying literature , I cannot progress past the first level .
Picking specifically onmight be a little cruel .
It 's happened a great many times before , with conversions of some of the finest games around .'s PC release famously omitted a menu option to quit the game , such was the laziness of the conversion .
There have been countless occurences of this type , and there will undoubtedly be more .
And it 's time we start getting a little bit irked about it , each and every time the issue crops up .
But these good reviews of ?
Bizarre .
I cannot understand them .
I 've yet to read a review that does n't at leastthe sloppiness of the conversion , but I have read a couple that suggest it does n't really matter .
Try as I might , I can't get behind that .
It 's a PC game that does n't work properly with PC hardware .
Whatever 's merits as a game may be , it utterly fails as a product .

If he'd been paid for such a shoddy conversion job , he 's not sure he'd be able to live with the guilt . ]
Troubled from your low credit score ?
If that 's the case , then you definitely should have not necessarily found out about a bad credit score cash mortgage .
The whole range of a low credit score cash home loan has appeared since the most suitable choice for the people people who are held in an instantaneous economical will need and should not strategy the original affordable financial loans because of their negative reputation credit score .

The aggressive spirit within the affordable market has attained to an acme and because of this kind of numerous top money loaning information mill supplying this helpful mortgage loan technique from affordable sum .
Therefore , when you have a sudden health - related cost to or even desire to spend your son or daughter 's school costs next staying with the process of a a bad credit score rating money mortgage loan would probably sound because the most appropriate idea .

Consequently , dozens of consumers , who would like to use a tangible economic help in the short time period of time , can simply progress using this mortgage help .
So far as implementing for the a low credit score money mortgage loan is concerned , nowadays folks largely go with the choice of on the web remedies rather than the standard way of visiting Auto Insurance Quotes Florida & Texas company 's business office .
Whilst implementing by means of world wide web , a job candidate is needed to submit proper details about his or her name , address and contact figures .
In addition to this , total information regarding the location placement , consideration particulars , economical establishment statements and also replicates of one 's driving permit are also needed to be sent in .
Each one of these documents can be delivered digitally through a secured network relationship .
Therefore , the actual consumers usually stays confident with the stage in which absolutely no chances of identity fraud or perhaps improper use of the provided specifics is going to be entertained .
The Digital Copying Glass is Half Full
It ’s common , in jeremiads against filesharing and free culture “ communism , ” to earn some populist cred by sympathizing with the little guy .
Sure , they say , big artists with name recognition can make money from “ Freemium ” ( i.e. , using free content to promote the sale of paid auxilliary goods ) .
But the little guy ca n’t do that .
I ’m more than a little skeptical of such claims .
I ’m more inclined to credit Cory Doctorow , who says that for the little guy , obscurity is a lot bigger danger than “ piracy . ”
I suspect a lot of them are pretty unimaginative when it comes to thinking of alternative ways to monetize their products .
All they ’re thinking of is the stuff the record companies can’t charge money for to pay them .
They ’re not thinking of the new possibilities opened up by all the things they can now do for themselves , at virtually zero cost , that formerly only a highly capitalized record company could do for them .
Their entire view of the world is still shaped by a time when producing and selling records required capital assets costing many millions of dollars , and the way to make money from music was to convince some such giant company that your work was worth producing and marketing .
What ’s more , even assuming that filesharing really does cut into the total revenues of the little guy who ’s trying to make a full - time career out of music , that ’s looking at only one side of the picture .
It neglects what Bastiat called “ the unseen . ”
Let ’s move from music to writing and consider my case .
I do n’t waste time pissing and moaning about the sharing of pdf files of my books at torrent sites , or how much money it ’s costing me .
To me , the proper basis for comparison is the money I still can make that I never could have made at all in the “ good old days . ”
In the good old days , I ’d have painstakingly put together a manuscript of hundreds of pages , and then put it away to gather cobwebs when I could n’t persuade the gatekeepers at a conventional publisher that it was worth marketing .
Never mind whether online file - sharing ’s costing me money ( I do n’t think it is –I believe the ebooks are more like free advertising ) .
More importantly , if it were n’t for digital publishing technologies and free publishing venues on the Internet , I would probably have lived and died doing menial labor with nobody anywhere ever hearing of my ideas .
Thanks to digital culture , I ’m able to make my work directly available to anyone in the world who has an Internet connection .
If only a tiny fraction of the people who can read it for free decide to buy it , giving me a few thousand dollars a year in royalties , I ’m richer by exactly that amount than I would have been in the “ good old days ” when my manuscripts would have yellowed in an attic .
For every small full - time musician who has a harder time scraping by , and may have to supplement his performing revenues with a day job , I suspect there are ten people like me who would have spent their entire lives as ( if you ’ll pardon the expression ) mute inglorious Miltons , without ever making a goddamned cent from their music or writing , but who can now be heard .
And for every blockbuster writer or musician , who has a few million shaved off his multimillion dollar revenues as a result of online “ piracy , ” I suspect there are probably a hundred people like me .
I ’m sure there are plenty of people like Jaron Lanier and Mark Helprin who would n’t consider it any great loss had my work been stillborn in a world without the Internet .
I ’m just another one of those “ hive mind ” people who write like Popeye talks , destroying authorial voice , and yada yada yada .
Well , fuck ’em .
For 80 years it has been accepted that early life began in a ' primordial soup ' of organic molecules before evolving out of the oceans millions of years later .
Today the ' soup ' theory has been over turned in a pioneering paper in BioEssays which claims it was the Earth 's chemical energy , from hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor , which kick - started early life .
" Textbooks have it that life arose from organic soup and that the first cells grew by fermenting these organics to generate energy in the form of ATP .
We provide a new perspective on why that old and familiar view wo n't work at all , " said team leader Dr Nick lane from University College London .
" We present the alternative that life arose from gases ( H 2 , CO 2 , N 2 , and H 2 S ) and that the energy for first life came from harnessing geochemical gradients created by mother Earth at a special kind of deep - sea hydrothermal vent -- one that is riddled with tiny interconnected compartments or pores . "
The soup theory was proposed in 1929 when J.B.S
Haldane published his influential essay on the origin of life in which he argued that UV radiation provided the energy to convert methane , ammonia and water into the first organic compounds in the oceans of the early earth .
However critics of the soup theory point out that there is no sustained driving force to make anything react ; and without an energy source , life as we know it can't exist .
" Despite bioenergetic and thermodynamic failings the 80 - year - old concept of primordial soup remains central to mainstream thinking on the origin of life , " said senior author , William Martin , an evolutionary biologist from the Insitute of Botany III in Düsseldorf .
" But soup has no capacity for producing the energy vital for life . "
In rejecting the soup theory the team turned to the Earth 's chemistry to identify the energy source which could power the first primitive predecessors of living organisms : geochemical gradients across a honeycomb of microscopic natural caverns at hydrothermal vents .
These catalytic cells generated lipids , proteins and nucleotides which may have given rise to the first true cells .
The team focused on ideas pioneered by geochemist Michael J. Russell , on alkaline deep sea vents , which produce chemical gradients very similar to those used by almost all living organisms today -- a gradient of protons over a membrane .
Early organisms likely exploited these gradients through a process called chemiosmosis , in which the proton gradient is used to drive synthesis of the universal energy currency , ATP , or simpler equivalents .
Later on cells evolved to generate their own proton gradient by way of electron transfer from a donor to an acceptor .
The team argue that the first donor was hydrogen and the first acceptor was CO 2 .
" Modern living cells have inherited the same size of proton gradient , and , crucially , the same orientation -- positive outside and negative inside -- as the inorganic vesicles from which they arose " said co-author John Allen , a biochemist at Queen Mary , University of London .
" Thermodynamic constraints mean that chemiosmosis is strictly necessary for carbon and energy metabolism in all organisms that grow from simple chemical ingredients [ autotrophy ] today , and presumably the first free - living cells , " said Lane .
" Here we consider how the earliest cells might have harnessed a geochemically created force and then learned to make their own . "
This was a vital transition , as chemiosmosis is the only mechanism by which organisms could escape from the vents .
" The reason that all organisms are chemiosmotic today is simply that they inherited it from the very time and place that the first cells evolved -- and they could not have evolved without it , " said Martin .
" Far from being too complex to have powered early life , it is nearly impossible to see how life could have begun without chemiosmosis , " concluded Lane .
" It is time to cast off the shackles of fermentation in some primordial soup as ' life without oxygen ' -- an idea that dates back to a time before anybody in biology had any understanding of how ATP is made . "
New laws cracking down on children 's use of mobile phones are to be introduced in France amid growing fears that they may cause cancer and other diseases .
All advertising of the devices to children under 12 is to be prohibited under the legislation – announced by the Environment Minister , Jean - Louis Borloo , last week – and he will also take powers to ban the sale of any phone designed to be used by those under six .
The French government will also introduce new limits for radiation from the phones and make it compulsory for handsets to be sold with earphones , so that users can avoid irradiating their heads and brains .
And one of the country 's largest cities last month started an advertising campaign to discourage the use of the phones by children .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The clampdown represents the most comprehensive action yet taken by any government worldwide .
It contrasts sharply with the stance of British ministers , who have largely ignored the recommendations of an official report nine years ago that people aged under 16 should be discouraged from using mobiles , and that the industry should be stopped from promoting them to children .
Since then their use by the young has almost doubled , so that nine out of 10 of the country 's 16 - year - olds own a handset .
Swedish research indicates that children and teenagers are five times more likely to get brain cancer if they use the phones , causing some experts to predict an " epidemic " of the disease among today 's young people in later life .
But consideration of the threat to them has been specifically excluded from Britain 's official £ 3.1 m investigation into the risk of cancer from mobiles .
The French ministry warned that " mobile phone use is increasing at a rapid pace among youths " , and warns that the young may be " more sensitive because their bodies are still developing " .
Children 's heads are smaller and their skulls thinner .
Lyon , France 's second city , launched an advertising campaign before Christmas aimed at dissuading people from buying mobiles for children as presents , with the slogan " Let 's keep them healthy , away from mobile phones ! "
A year ago France 's official Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health Safety said that parents should not give small children mobiles .
And France 's Health Ministry urged using them in moderation .
The French legislation is the latest evidence of growing official alarm at the hazards of the radiation caused by mobile phone use .
In September , the European Parliament voted 522 to 16 to urge ministers across Europe to bring in stricter radiation limits , and the European Environment Agency has also issued a warning .
Toronto's Department of Public Health has advised that children under eight should only use mobiles in emergencies and teenagers should limit calls to less than 10 minutes .
The Russian Ministry of Health says that young people under 18 should not use the devices , and Israel 's Health Ministry has also advised caution .

Oh boo fucking hoo .
For the first time in my life I 'm really beginning to understand why the French went so nuts with the Guillotine .
They were just sick to death of having to watch spoiled aristocrats behave as if a bunch of hungry , armed , very pissed off peasants presented absolutely no threat to them whatsoever .
At some point you want to kick their privileged asses just to shut them up .

" Accepting death is better than letting the elites rule us , " said Thonglor Manglat , a retiree and Thaksin supporter , outside the Supreme Court before the verdict was announced .
" Even if the soldiers come out and shoot at us next month , we wo n't run in fear . "
Although pro-Thaksin leaders have called for nonviolent disobedience , rallies have turned violent , including an assault on Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva 's motorcade last April and rioting at a summit of world leaders a few weeks later .
And Thaksin opponents seized the capital 's two airports for a week in 2008 .
America -- in terms of the country 's collective consciousness -- tries its darnedest to not learn from itshistory let alone from events in other countries .
The right - wing party in this country has gone so far as to discourage education itself .
Earlier today we met North Carolina Democrat Billy Kennedy , who is running against an elected Republican congresswoman , Virginia Foxx , who tries to make a case against public education , her point being that why should rich people pay for poor people 's children to get an education .
In Utah we learned a couple weeks ago how elements of the GOP were determined to continue chipping away at public education by abolishing the 11th and 12th grades , although the state seems perfectly happy with the " compromise " position of making the 12th grade " optional , " while the system discourages the option .
It 's called " dumbing down " the population , a dream for right - wing politicians who can only thrive on an ignorant and easily manipulated , uneducated voter base .
The Founding Fathers could n't have been clearer on the importance of the separation of Church and State , based on catastrophic experiences in European religious wars .
And yet religionist divisiveness is a keystone of reactionary political thought in America .
I remember reading in Rep. Robert Wexler 's entertaining book , Fire - Breathing Liberal about his adventures on the House Foreign Relations Committee , meeting Republicans for whom it was a Badge of Courage to brag aboutever traveling abroad or even owning a passport !
The current crop of ideologically self - justifying robber barons at theapex of the GOP is apparently completely unaware of the lessons of the French Revolution .
They may be in for an unpleasant surprise .
Yesterday Digby pointed out the unseemly whining of JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon -- who still has n't digested his $ 17 million bonus this year -- about how " Washington has become increasingly erratic and unfair in its treatment of the banks over the last few months . "
Like me , I see Digby has also been thinking about the French Revolution .
Unlike Republican members of Congress , Ito travel and I love studying history .
I 'm proud to say I 've lived all over the world for years on end and still travel to remote and foreign places annually .
I write a travel blog as well and love learning from the experiences other countries have .
One place I 've been to over and over is Thailand .
In February of 2006 I write about that country 's Bush - buddy fascist -- Thaksin Shinawatra , a plutocrat demagogue appealing to desperate and ignorant populism .
He was eventually overthrown but today ' scatches us up with this powerful criminal who could well serve as an idol for American teabaggers .
The Thai Supreme Court is confiscating $ 1.4 billion after determining that he was , simply put , a crook .
America needslots and lots and lots of that .
Maybe it would stave off Madame Guillotine .
Oddly , the Court has decided to leave Thaksin with nearly a billion dollars in his ill - gotten gains !
Thaksin and his former wife , Potjaman na Pombejra , were unanimously found guilty of 5 counts of corruption ( and of pursuing policies with Myanmar that would enrich his family ) and convicted of hiding ownership of shares in family business Shin Corp.
during his five years in office , and of abusing his power by crafting policies that benefited the company .
Thai teabaggers are outraged that their hero was found guilty and that his stolen loot is being returned to the people of Thailand .

Yes , according to online market research firm OnePoll , women may say they 're looking for a handsome , trim , clean - cut , manly man , but what they really want is a scruffy , pudgy geek .
This is surely not news to those of us who had to fend off hordes of female admirers in high school and college .

You have to admire this article on the research from the UK newspaper Daily Mail 's website .
It takes a rare and special editing talent to adorn an article about women finding men who are not conventionally handsome attractive with pictures of such noted geeks as David Beckham , Gerard Butler and Johnny Depp .
And assuming that Tobey Maguire is a geek based entirely on his portrayal of Spider - Man : brilliant !
This research does raise an important question , though : where are all the GeekDad groupies ?

An article in Saturday ’s Section A about the murder conviction of Scott Roeder in the death of Dr. George Tiller said Tiller was the eighth abortion provider since 1993 to be killed by antiabortion extremists .
He was the fourth doctor and the eighth person . —
When he was slain in the vestibule of his church last May 31 , Tiller became the fourth doctor since 1993 to be killed by antiabortion extremists .
In June , his family announced that his clinic would close permanently .
The jury of seven men and five women deliberated for only 37 minutes before finding Roeder guilty of premeditated murder .
He faces life in prison .
Sentencing is set for March 9 .
Roeder , who testified Thursday that he had methodically stalked and killed Tiller , 67 , to stop him from performing abortions , reacted little to a verdict his attorneys said he expected .
His face flushed slightly , but he did not move .
Whether Roeder shot Tiller at point - blank range in the forehead was never at issue ; Roeder had admitted it to reporters , in court filings and finally in calm , measured tones to a jury on Thursday .
“ If someone did not stop him , ” said Roeder , “ these babies were going to continue to die . ”
The tall , balding defendant said he felt relief after the killing .
In the 3 1/ 2 hours after the killing , he drove toward Kansas City , he said , stopping to stash his gun in a rural dirt pile , change his shirt and eat a pizza .
Advocates for abortion rights praised the verdict .
“ We now strongly urge the U.S. Department of Justice to follow through on its announcement to investigate Dr. Tiller ’s murder to determine whether Roeder planned the shooting with anyone else , ” said Nancy Northup , president of the Center for Reproductive Rights .
The Justice Department has confirmed it is investigating Roeder , who it alleges was caught tampering with the locks of an abortion clinic in Kansas City the day before he shot Tiller .
Nancy Keenan , president of NARAL Pro-Choice America , urged abortion foes to tone down their “ inflammatory rhetoric and tactics that inspire this kind of violent action from the most extreme factions of the anti-choice movement . ”
Some here , however , had words of support for the defendant .
“ I do n’t condone what Scott Roeder did , but I cannot condemn the consistency of his logic , ” said Randall Terry , a founder of antiabortion group Operation Rescue .
“ George Tiller killed 60,000 innocent human beings in barbaric ways , and Scott felt the way to protect more babies from a grisly death was to kill Tiller . ”
Jan Holman , an elderly antiabortion activist , drove from Iowa for the trial .
She came in a truck covered with photographs of aborted fetuses .
“ I support Scott Roeder , ” she said .
“ I guess you might say he ’s my hero . ”
After the shooting , mainstream antiabortion groups denounced the killing .
Roeder hoped to claim the killing was justifiable homicide , based on his belief that abortion is murder .
Sedgwick County District Judge Warren
Wilbert ruled that that defense was not legal , but he initially left open the possibility that he would allow the jury to consider a voluntary - manslaughter defense .
But Wilbert ruled Thursday , after the defense concluded its case , that the jury could consider only whether Roeder had committed premeditated first - degree murder , because the defendant ’s actions did not meet the state ’s criteria for the lesser crime .
That decision in effect ended Roeder ’s defense , said one of his public defenders , Mark Rudy .
In a brief closing argument , Rudy tried to compare Roeder to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , and by inference Rosa Parks -- people whose acts of civil disobedience had righted social wrongs .
Roeder also was convicted on two counts of aggravated assault for threatening to shoot Keith Martin and Gary Hoepner as he fled Tiller ’s Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita .
Dr. Warren Hern of Boulder , Colo. , a friend of Tiller ’s who is one of the few U.S. physicians who continue to perform late - term abortions , said Friday he was furious that the judge ever considered allowing the defense to raise the idea of voluntary manslaughter .
“ The judge gave this assassin a national platform for his inflammatory propaganda , ” he said .
“ How many more abortion doctors will have to be assassinated before the American people understand that this is a violent terrorist movement ? ”
Advocates on both sides of the abortion divide found themselves squeezed uncomfortably together on the hard courtroom benches during the trial .
One spectator was Michael Bray , who spent nearly five years in prison for bombings in the 1980s related to his antiabortion views .
He said he hoped Roeder would eventually be released and did n’t think he ’d kill again .
“ There are bombers who have been released from jail who have n’t bombed again , ” he said with a wide grin .
“ There is precedent . ”
The conviction brings a kind of closure to the city of Wichita , which became a center of the antiabortion movement in the late 1980s and 1990s because of Tiller ’s presence .
In 1993 , antiabortion activist Rachelle Shannon shot Tiller in both arms .
Roeder testified that he had befriended Shannon , who is in prison in Kansas for firebombing abortion clinics .
“ I admired her , ” he said .
Many of Tiller ’s patients were women who discovered late in pregnancy that their fetuses were severely compromised by genetic anomalies .
In a statement Friday , Tiller ’s family thanked the jury , police and prosecutors :
“ At this time we hope that George can be remembered for his legacy of service to women , the help he provided for those who needed it , and the love and happiness he provided us as a husband , father and grandfather . ”

Reporting from Washington and New York Richard A. Serrano --
An Afghan immigrant admitted to a federal judge Monday that he was so enraged by U.S. military actions in Afghanistan that he attended an Al Qaeda training camp and planned to commit a suicide bombing in New York -- possibly on the subway -- to protest the war .
The plot was thwarted in September after the immigrant , Najibullah Zazi , began to fear that police were trailing him and left the city , but Zazi ’s chilling statement during a plea hearing in federal court suggested that it came close to fruition .
“ The plan was to conduct a martyrdom operation . . . as soon as materials were ready , ” said Zazi , 25 , after he pleaded guilty to three counts that could put him in prison for life .
The charges included conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against U.S. targets ; conspiracy to commit murder in a foreign country ; and providing material support for a foreign terrorism organization -- in this case , Al Qaeda .

Asked by U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Dearie to explain exactly what the martyrdom operation would have entailed , Zazi replied , “ To me , it meant I would sacrifice myself to bring attention to what the U.S. military was doing to civilians in Afghanistan . ”
The purpose , he said , was to “ sacrifice my soul for the sake of others . ”
In Washington , Atty .
Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. called the case “ one of the most serious threats to our nation since Sept. 11 , 2001 . ”
“ This attempted attack on our homeland was real , it was in motion , and it would have been deadly , ” Holder said .
Advertisement
Zazi ’s guilty plea came five months after his arrest in Denver and suggested he was prepared to provide information on alleged co-conspirators .
“ The criminal justice system also contains powerful incentives to induce pleas that yield long sentences and gain intelligence that can be used in the fight against Al Qaeda , ” Holder said at a news conference .
Zazi ’s lawyer , William Stampur , refused to comment when asked why his client decided to plead guilty .
The Associated Press reported that Zazi was swayed by law enforcement officials ’ warnings that his mother could face criminal charges related to immigration issues .
The plea agreement was sealed .

Holder used the Zazi case to strengthen his argument -- one embraced by the White House -- that terrorists should be prosecuted in civilian courts in this country .
Holder recently had to reconsider his plan to try the top Sept. 11 plotters , including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , in New York City because of an outcry by conservatives who say it would be too costly and too dangerous to have such a trial so close to where the attack took place .
“ In this case , as it has in so many other cases , the criminal justice system has proved to be an invaluable weapon for disrupting plots and incapacitating terrorists , ” the attorney general said .
In court , Zazi , who attended high school in Queens , N.Y. , spoke lightly accented English as he confessed in a calm and polite demeanor .
Advertisement
He addressed Dearie as “ sir ” and “ your honor ” as the judge explained the ramifications of a guilty plea and sought to ensure that Zazi understood the process .
Zazi , whose thick black beard was neatly trimmed and whose hands were uncuffed , spoke in a clear , dispassionate tone .
The transition from airport shuttle driver in Colorado -- the job Zazi had when he was arrested -- to would - be terrorist came in spring and summer 2008 , Zazi said in a statement .
According to his account , Zazi and his co-conspirators -- whom authorities have not yet named -- met up in Queens and discussed their opposition to the war in Afghanistan .
Advertisement
In particular , Zazi said , they were bitter over the deaths of civilians in his homeland -- an issue that has become a major concern of U.S. military commanders as they try to win public support from Afghans for major anti-Taliban offensives .
Zazi said he and his co-conspirators decided “ to join the Taliban -- to fight alongside the Taliban against the United States . ”
“ We agreed to this plan .
I did so because of my feelings about what the U.S. was doing in Afghanistan , ” he said .
The first step was to travel to Pakistan , which they did in August 2008 .
But before Zazi could join the Taliban , he was recruited by Al Qaeda and sent to a training camp in Waziristan , near the Afghan border .
Advertisement
While there , Zazi said in court , he took notes on bomb - making instructions and e-mailed them to himself for future reference .
He and his trainers discussed locations for future attacks , which included the New York subways .
After he returned to the United States in January 2009 , Zazi said , he accessed his e-mailed notes and began researching places to purchase bomb - making supplies .
His research led him to beauty supply stores in the Denver suburb of Aurora , where he stocked up on items such as acetone and hydrogen peroxide .
They are among the ingredients used to make triacetone triperoxide , the explosive that Zazi had planned to use in his attack .
Zazi , equipped with his supplies , then drove to New York , where he arrived Sept. 10 to undertake the suicide bombing as soon as materials were ready , he said in court .
Advertisement
Instead , Zazi began suspecting that police were watching him , so he got rid of the materials and flew back to Colorado , where he was arrested Sept. 19 .
The guilty plea was the latest twist in a case that FBI Deputy Director John S. Pistole said Monday “ illustrated the evolving nature of the terrorist threat , ” involving international travel and training on foreign soil to carry out attacks on domestic targets .
In January , two more men who were classmates of Zazi when he attended high school in Queens were arrested in New York in connection with the case .
One of them , Adis Medunjanin , has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to commit murder on foreign soil , a charge prosecutors say involves plans to fight the U.S. military in Afghanistan .
The other , Zarein Ahmedzay , was charged with lying to authorities and has pleaded not guilty .
Advertisement
Zazi ’s father , Mohammed Wali Zazi , and a Queens imam , Ahmad Wais Afzali , also were arrested in connection with the case , but neither has been accused of direct involvement in the plot .
Both have been freed on bail after pleading not guilty to charges that include lying to authorities .

Think Progress has more on this -- Republicans dismayed by Obama ’s strong performance , say it was a ‘ mistake ’ to let cameras roll .
Apparently things were going so well for the President that ClusterFox decided they had better cut away from their coverage and proceed to bashing him -- Fox Cuts Away From Obama - GOP Conversation In Order To Get A Head Start On Attacks : He Was ‘ Lecturing ’ .
Somehow I doubt the Republicans are going to want to do this again , or at least with the cameras on , any time soon .
RUSSERT : On the bigger picture though that I found extremely interesting today is the decision to allow the cameras present for the Q&A .
Last night the White House called the GOP leadership and requested this .
It obviously turned out to be a brilliant political move .
Tom Cole — former head of the NRCC , congressman from Oklahoma — said , “ He scored many points .
He did really well . ”
Barack Obama , for an hour and a half , was able to refute every single Republican talking point used against him on the major issues of the day .
In essence , it was almost like a debate where he was front and center for the majority of it .
It 's very , very interesting to see what this will do to the political dialog for the rest of next week .
Final point on that I do believe one Republican said to me , off the record , and saying behind closed doors : “ It was a mistake that we allowed the cameras to roll like that .
We should not have done that . ”
Very interesting .
WITT : Why ?
Why ?
Because they did n't fire away the way they really wanted to for fear of repurcussions you know , ala Joe Wilson " You lie " if there was disrespect shown ?
RUSSERT : Well , when the Democrats did this they had a closed camera session right , when he had a meeting with the Democrats last month ...
WITT : Right ...
RUSSERT : By allowing these cameras to roll , it allowed Obama to sit there for an hour and a half refuting every single Republican talking point , which he really has not had an opportunity to do in his campaign rally speeches that he 's been doing in Florida yesterday , that he 's been doing addresses in the White House .
He was able to directly refute Republicans to their face for an hour and a half on T.V .
I think he scored a lot of political points .

DAWN.COM | Pakistan | Death toll climbs to 93 in Lakki Marwat blast
Only a few days after Monday ’s horrific bombing of a Shiite procession in Karachi , the Pakistani Taliban struck again , blowing up a truck bomb in the middle of a volleyball match at a Pashtun village bordering South Waziristan .
The village is the center of a tribal militia that has fought Taliban forces .
The Federally Administered Tribal Area is a headquarters for the Taliban Movement of Pakistan , and a major campaign against the latter has been being waged by the Pakistani army .
The bombings are the small terrorist group ’s way of inflicting damage on a much stronger Pakistani establishment– and one that is attracting the allegiance of Pashtuns in the struggle against Talibanism .
Al - Jazeera English has video :
At the same time , a CIA drone attack killed 6 persons in North Waziristan , the HQ of the Haqqani network of militants who are allied with al - Qaeda and the Taliban .
Unreported in most Western press accounts was that Friday also saw a coordinated series of peace marches in 53 cities of Pakistan by civil society organization protesting both Taliban bombings , especially the attack on Shiites in Karachi on Monday , and the American drone strikes .
A general strike was called by largely Sunni parties in interior Sindh province to protest Monday ’s bombing of Shiites .
In Karachi itself , Shiites staged marches and rallies .
The violence at the volleyball game and the drone strikes are big stories .
But they should not overshadow the peace rallies and the gesture of Sunnis protesting Taliban bombings of Shiites .
The Pakistani public is clearly fed up with the Taliban , and is cheering on the army in its struggle against them .
If it were n’t for the American drone attacks , in fact , there would not be the slightest ambiguity in the politics of peace and anti-terrorism .
For the hatred for the Taliban in the Swat Valley , which they briefly took over last spring see this Aljazeera English video– note especially the reaction of students and teachers at girls ’ schools :
For an end of the year review of the state of political play in Pakistan see Maliha Lodhi .
It is a judicious assessment .
But I see the big sea change as the turning of the Pakistanis against the Taliban , which they had earlier seemed to think of as anti-imperialist and committed Muslims , even if a bit rigid .
Now , I think most Pakistanis see them as thugs and terrorists , a remarkable change .
She is right , though , that this change does not alter their suspicion of and fear of the ambitions of the United States in their country and their region .

Savage Love The 15 - Year Itch
I am a 15 - year - old kid who lacks self - esteem , self - confidence , and just plain good looks .
I 've spent my entire life without a kiss from a girl , and even spent a year thinking I was in love with my sister .
My right hand is in extreme pain from the amount of whacking I do , and I 'm looking for some advice on how to get off my ass and go get that girl .
The thing is , girls just do n't seem to want me .
I even have a hard time talking to girls .
Can I get some advice ?
Boy in Need of Sex
There 's nothing remarkable about being 15 , horny , and hard - up , BINOS .
And do n't be such a whiner .
You have n't gone 15 years without a kiss from a girl .
Before you hit puberty , you probably were n't even that interested in girls -- so at most you 've gone without for three years , not 15 .
If you can stop wallowing in self - pity , you 'll have an easier time keeping your problem in perspective .
Here are a few more perspectives you may or may not find comforting :
That crush on your sister ?
That sometimes happens to straight boys .
You hit puberty , your sister hits puberty , and suddenly she 's a strange new animal , barely recognizable , and soon you 're thinking some mighty discomforting thoughts .
But then the ol ' reliable incest taboo starts whispering in your ear --" She 's your fucking sister , you fucking pervert ! " -- and you snap out of it .
If you did n't get your sister pregnant or wind up with a creepy incest fetish , BINOS , you got through it fine .
On to your real heartache : Girls do n't want you .
That hurts .
I remember what it was like when I was 15 years old and I wanted boys and boys did n't want me .
It sucks .
But the sad fact is that most 15 - year - old boys are repulsive -- that is , most 15 - year - old boys are awkward , half - formed works in progress .
I certainly was at 15 .
The fact that girls mature physically more quickly than boys just compounds your misery ; most girls your age already look like young women , and most are attracted to boys who look like young men , and there you are , aching for that first kiss but still looking like a short , hairless chimp no girl will look at twice .
But take heart , BINOS , because your awkward / repulsive stage will pass -- just like that crush on your sister .
While you can't hurry the process along , you can prepare .
Here 's how :
Worry less about getting your 15 - year - old self laid , and start thinking about getting your 18 - or 20 - year - old self laid .
Join a gym and build yourself a body that girls will find irresistible ; read a lot so you 'll have something to say to the girls you do attract ; and get out of the house and do shit -- political shit , social shit , low - stakes shit -- so that you 'll meet different kinds of girls in different kinds of settings and you 'll get comfortable talking to them .
More assignments :
Get a decent haircut and use deodorant and floss your teeth and take regular showers and wear clean clothes .
Go online and learn about birth control and STDs , and learn enough about the clitoris that you 'll be able to find it in the dark .
I also recommend that you masturbate in moderation -- no more than 10 times a day -- and that you vary your routine .
I can't emphasize this last point enough .
A vagina does not feel exactly like a clenched fist , BINOS - - nor does a mouth , an anus , tit - fucking , or humping .
If you do n't want to be sending me another pathetic letter in a few years , you 'll vary your routine now so that you 'll be able to respond to different kinds , levels , and intensities of sexual stimulation once you do become sexually active .
Good luck , kiddo .
Just read your column devoted to people in sexless relationships .
But there was one thing you did n't cover : being in a sexless relationship while raising kids .
My wife and I had two kids right off the bat .
She doubled her weight and got depressed .
That was eight years ago , and we 've probably had sex a dozen times since .
I 've kept myself in shape , but she has no interest .
And of course she has n't tried to keep herself in shape , so I do n't find her attractive .
Getting divorced because I 'm not getting any seems selfish , as the kids are innocent in this mess .
She wo n't let me mess around -- I 've asked .
I go back and forth between wanting to find a fuckbuddy on the side and telling myself " too bad " for 10 more years .
I 'd prefer that my wife drop half her weight and take the stick out of her ass .
But I can't force her to do those things .
Any advice ?
At Least I 'm Fucked One Way
If you 're staying together for the kids -- which I support -- then do what you need to do to keep yourself sane enough to be a good father and a respectful , pleasant partner in the shared business of child - raising .
And while you do what you need to do , you should let her think what she needs to think so that she can be a sane mother and a good partner in the kid biz .
Just do n't get caught .
After reading your column last week , I started thinking that I 'm a really nice girlfriend .
I do n't get mad when my boyfriend jerks off or looks at porn .
But I 've gotten progressively more jealous about his online activities .
Can you tell me where , if anywhere , in this progression of events my boyfriend crossed the line ?
1 . Posting naked photos of himself on a website .
2 . Exchanging explicit e-mails and photos with women .
3 . Chatting with women for hours on end , including exchanging photos and viewing webcams .
4 . Receiving a phone call from a woman he chatted with .
I think I 'm being too nice , and he thinks I 'm being jealous and paranoid .
What do you think , sexual guru ?
Pretty Please , Will You Print My Letter ?
I 'm all for understanding , indulgent girlfriends ( and boyfriends ) who allow their men to be men-- i.e. , who allow their men to check out other people ( even if they 're sleeping only with you ) ; to jerk off without guilt or drama ( because they 're going to anyway ) ; and to " consume " pornography ( because that can help a guy keep his natural , hard - wired must - fuck - other - people urges under control ) .
However , PPWYPML , there 's a point at which being understanding and indulgent crosses the line and you 're just being a doormat and a fool .
You do sound nice - - too nice -- but your boyfriend sounds like an asshole , and he clearly does n't deserve you .
He 's cheating on you or about to cheat on you , rubbing your nose in it , and then accusing you of being jealous and paranoid when you object .
Dump him already .
Just a quick note to Bore Boy :
If he wants to have sex with a bored woman , all he has to do is get married .
Speaking from my experience and my friends ' experiences , a wife is bored nine times out of 10 at the idea of sleeping with her husband , especially after the first couple of kids .
So , Bore Boy , get hitched and be fruitful , and I personally guarantee all your fantasies will come true .
Been There Often
Thanks for sharing , BTO .

Heineken won the brew - off for Mexico's Femsa , brewer of Dos Equis , Tecate , and Sol .
The Dutch beer giant will pay $ 7.6 billion ( including debt ) for Femsa in an all - stock deal .
The move will boost Heineken 's presence as Mexico 's economy explodes , and will also help its market share in the U.S .
As the AP reports , Heineken was the biggest U.S. import for years , before being passed up by Corona .
The top two brands still account for more than 40 percent of the U.S. import market .
Modelo Especial is in third place and Femsa 's Tecate in fourth .
Corona Light , Dos Equis and Heineken Light are also among the top 10 imported brands , according to trade magazine Beer Marketer 's Insights .
Word of the deal first appeared last October , when Heineken and SABMiller were considered bidders .
Do n't Miss : The Next BRICs : Six Surging Countries You Must Pay Attention To This Decade
By TOBY STERLING , AP Business Writer
AMSTERDAM ( AP ) —
Heineken NV said Monday it will buy the beer - making operations of Mexico 's Femsa in an all - share deal that values the maker of Dos Equis , Tecate and Sol beers at $ 5.5 billion , excluding debt .
Heineken said the buy cements its position as the world 's second - largest brewer by sales , will help it grow in Mexico and Brazil , and will strengthen its position in the U.S. imported beer market .
Femsa Cerveza had sales of euro2.6 billion ( $ 3.8 billion ) and operating profits of euro618 million in 2008 , Heineken said .
Including debt , the deal is worth $ 7.6 billion ( euro5.3 billion ) .
" Through this deal we become a much stronger , more competitive player in Latin America , one of the world 's most profitable and fastest growing beer markets , " said Heineken Chief Executive Officer Jean - Francois van Boxmeer .
Shares rose 4 percent to euro34.25 in Amsterdam .
The acquisition is Heineken 's second major buy in the past two years , as it bought Scottish & Newcastle operations worth euro10.2 billion in May 2008 .
Heineken still trails Anheuser - Busch InBev SA as the largest brewer by sales , and leads SABMiller PLC .
Many analysts had expected SABMiller to win the race to buy Femsa , though Heineken already owned 17 percent of Femsa 's Brazilian operations and had a deal to distribute its brands in the U.S .
Heineken said it expects the deal to close in the second quarter , pending approval from regulators and shareholders .
Under the deal , Femsa — formally Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de CV — will take a 12.5 percent stake in Heineken NV and a 14.9 percent stake in its parent , Heineken Holding NV .
Those shares are valued at $ 5.5 billion , and Heineken is assuming Femsa debt and pension obligations of $ 2.1 billion .
Heineken 's unusual holding structure allows descendants of the Heineken family to control Heineken NV , and the company said Monday they have agreed to the deal .
A trust holding 39 percent of Femsa shares has also agreed , Heineken said .
Heineken forecasts cost savings from combining the companies ' operations to amount to euro150 million per year by 2013 .
It said the acquisition will begin adding to Heineken 's per-share earnings " after two years . "
Heineken was the best - selling imported beer in the U.S. for years before being surpassed by Corona Extra — owned by Femsa 's larger Mexican rival Grupo Modelo — in the late 1990s .
The top two brands still account for more than 40 percent of the U.S. import market .
Modelo Especial is in third place and Femsa 's Tecate in fourth .
Corona Light , Dos Equis and Heineken Light are also among the top 10 imported brands , according to trade magazine Beer Marketer 's Insights .
In Brazil , Femsa sells Kaiser , Bavaria Clasica and Xingu in addition to brands previously mentioned , and in Mexico it also sells Carta Blanca and Indio .
From Democracy Now -- White Power USA : The Rise of Right - Wing Militias in America :
Since President Obama ’s election , there ’s been a surge in hate crimes , political murders and assassination threats in this country .
Right - wing militias are on the rise in several states , and high rates of unemployment have further stoked anger against racial minorities and recent immigrants .
Independent filmmakers Rick Rowley and Jacquie Soohen go inside the white nationalist movement to file an exclusive report .
ANJALI KAMAT : It ’s been a year since Barack Obama was inaugurated as the first African American president of this country .
His election was lauded as a turning point in race relations .
But there ’s also been a racist backlash to his victory at the polls .
Right - wing militias are on the rise in several states across the country , and high rates of unemployment have further stoked anger against racial minorities and recent immigrants .
There ’s been a surge in hate crimes , political murders and assassination threats since Obama ’s election .
At least nine high - profile racially motivated murders have taken place this past year .
AMY GOODMAN : Well , independent filmmakers Rick Rowley and Jacquie Soohen went inside the white nationalist movement to investigate the backlash .
This is an excerpt of their short documentary White Power USA that aired in full on Al Jazeera English .
The full piece is available on the Al Jazeera website and on the Big Noise Films website .
It includes some disturbing language .
New research suggests that the act of voluntarily sharing something with another may not be entirely exclusive to the human experience .
A study published in the March 9th issue of Current Biology , observed that bonobos -- a sister species of chimpanzees and , like chimps , our closest living relatives -- consistently chose to actively share their food with others .
" It has been suggested that only humans voluntarily share their food , " says lead study author Brian Hare from Duke University in North Carolina .
" However , the food sharing preferences of the unusually tolerant bonobos have never been studied experimentally . "
Dr. Hare and Suzy Kwetuenda from the Lola ya Bonobo Sanctuary for orphaned bonobos in the Democratic Republic of the Congo conducted a study with unrelated pairs of hungry bonobos .
In the study , bonobos had to choose whether to eat some food by themselves or to give another bonobo access to it .
The test subjects had the opportunity to immediately eat the food or to use a " key " to open a door to an adjacent empty room or a room that had another bonobo in it .
The test subjects could easily see into the adjacent rooms , so they know which one was empty and which was occupied .
" We found that the test subjects preferred to voluntarily open the recipient 's door to allow them to share highly desirable food that they could have easily eaten alone -- with no signs of aggression , frustration , or change in the speed or rate of sharing across trials , " explains Dr. Hare .
" This stable sharing pattern was particularly striking since in other , nonsharing contexts , bonobos are averse to food loss and adjust to minimize such losses . "
The authors point out that it is possible that the bonobos in their study chose to share in order to obtain favors in the future .
Additional studies are needed to gain further insight into why bonobos and humans share .
" Given the continued debate about how to characterize the motivation underlying costly sharing in humans , it will certainly require future research to probe more precisely what psychological mechanisms motivate and maintain the preference we observe here in bonobos for voluntary , costly sharing , " concludes Dr. Hare .

' Let 's go and take Class A drugs ' - How foul - mouthed Liam Gallagher proved he 's still a yob at heart at the Brits
Host Peter Kay described him as a ' knobhead ' and there can't be many viewers of the Brit Awards who would disagree with his assessment of Liam Gallagher .
Picking up the gong for Best Album of 30 Years for the 1995 record ( What ’s The Story ) Morning Glory ? , the Oasis star swore his way through his acceptance speech , before hurling his microphone and award into the audience .
Later , on ITV2's backstage coverage , he continued his foul - mouthed tirade before saying to Nicole Appleton , one of the presenters who also happens to be his wife : ' Come on let 's all go and take some Class A drugs . '

Arriving alone on stage , he yelled into the microphone : ' Listen kids .
I want to thank Bonehead , Guigsy and Alan White .
The best band in the f***ing world .
Live forever .'
It was after he threw his microphone and award into the crowd and sulked off the stage , the on - form Kay remarked : ' What a knobhead . '
A stage manager had to plead with the audience last night during a commercial break to return the microphone so Best Group winner Kasabian - who were due next on stage - could perform .
Lairy Liam reacted with fury today on Twitter , retorting : ' Listen up fat f**k as a real northerner I was brought up 2 say s**t 2 people 's faces not behind their back .

Meanwhile , a Facebook group set up to back Peter Kay 's TV putdown to Gallagher has now attracted over 91,000 members .
But Liam 's bad behaviour did n't end there .
During ITV2's post Brits coverage , Liam left his wife Nicole red faced after he asked her to come and take Class A drugs with him .
The outburst was captured live on ITV2 as he was interviewed by her and her former All Saints bandmate Melanie Blatt .
It has also emerged that the star was involved in a backstage bust - up moments after walking off stage , when he shoved a young woman employed by Brit organisers to pose as a human statue outside guests ' dressing rooms .
After she stumbled back , the drunken star then launched himself at her a second time leaving her splayed on the floor in agony .
The unprovoked attack was witnessed by dozens of onlookers who looked on in horror before rushing to help the stricken girl .
Gallagher had to be restrained by two members of his own security team who wrestled him out of the backstage area and returned him to his seat in the auditorium .
One onlooker said : ' His behaviour was disgraceful .
Thankfully the girl is alright , although she has got a bit of a limp .
He was clearly desperate to cause a bit of trouble but to attack a young girl is unacceptable .
Everyone thought he was just acting like a child . '
He was also at the centre of an internet hoax after someone claiming to have picked up the award he tossed into the crowd advertised it on auction site eBay .
It had already attracted bids of up to £ 250,000 when Brit organisers confirmed it was a scam and that Gallagher had been reunited with his award after the show .
Liam has a history of causing trouble at the Brits .

PLEASE NOTE : VIDEO CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Google ’s assertion that its computers were attacked by hackers based in China was “ groundless , ” Beijing said on Tuesday , hardening its rhetoric in a spat with Washington over Internet freedom .

The remarks from Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang were the first direct rejection of the firm ’s allegations .
China had previously defended its right to censor content on the Internet and brushed aside the hacking accusations , saying Google must abide by Chinese law .
“ Google ’s statement from January 12 is groundless , and we are firmly opposed to it , ” Qin told a regular news briefing in the Chinese capital , when asked if there had been any development in a dispute that is now more than a month old .
“ China administers its Internet according to law , and this position will not change .
China prohibits hacking and will crack down on hacking according to law , ” he added .
Google , the world ’s top search engine , said in January it had uncovered sophisticated China - based attacks on human rights activists using its Gmail service around the world .
Google said other firms had also been affected , and after checks into the attacks , the firm had decided it was no longer willing to tolerate censorship on its Google .cn search engine .
Google also threatened to shut its China offices .
Washington backed Google and urged Beijing to investigate the hacking complaints thoroughly and transparently .
In Washington , State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley had no direct response to China ’s latest assertion , but said the U.S. position on the matter remained unchanged .
“ It is our perspective that individuals in China played a role in that ( incident ) .
That continues to be our perspective and we will continue to have these conversations with China on this subject , ” Crowley told a news briefing .
The dispute about Internet censorship has added to tensions about issues ranging from trade and the Chinese currency , to a meeting last week between U.S. President Barack Obama and exiled Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama .
The hacking issue made headlines anew after recent reports in the Western media that the attacks had been traced to two schools in China , and the writer of the spyware used had been identified as a Chinese security consultant in his 30s with government links .
The prestigious Shanghai Jiaotong University and previously unknown Lanxiang vocational college , a high - school level institution , have both denied any role in the attacks .
GOOGLE - CHINA TALKS
The foreign ministry ’s Qin said the schools ’ comments showed the reports were false , as were claims of a link with Beijing .
“ Reports that these attacks came from Chinese schools are totally groundless and the accusation of Chinese government involvement is also irresponsible and driven by ulterior motives , ” Qin said .
The official Xinhua news agency lashed out as well , with a commentary saying the stories were “ arbitrary and full of bias . ”
Chinese people know little about online security , and so their computers can easily be taken over by hackers to give the impression that the hackers are based in China , it said .
Google ’s Chinese - language search engine is still censoring results , but talks between the firm and the Chinese government , on whether the firm might be able to run an unrestricted search service within Chinese law , have restarted , the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday .
They had taken a break over Chinese New Year , the biggest holiday of the year when most of the country grinds to a halt .
Qin declined to comment directly on any negotiations , saying he had no details but “ relevant officials are having smooth communication with relevant Internet companies . ”

And guess what ?
He 's doing rather well for himself .
OBAMA TO HASTEN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE MIDDLE CLASS
By Michael LeMieux
January 15 , 2010
NewsWithViews.com
It was announced today ( Jan 14 ) that President Obama wants to levy a fee against the largest banks in the country with a “ crisis responsibility fee ” to be applied to financial organizations with assets greater than $ 50 Billion .
This fee will be in effect for the next ten years and can be extended beyond that if necessary .
The expectation is that this will raise $ 90 Billion dollars over the ten years in an attempt to repay some of the money used to bail out the financial industry .
My immediate question is ; does this administration and this President think we are stupid or is this administration and this President so inept that they think this is good for the American people ?
I say that because they are either trying to totally bankrupt the middle class in this country or our ‘ leaders ’ are completely ignorant of the economy of this nation .
Simply put businesses do not pay taxes / fees the government assesses them with .
As an example ; if you own a burger joint and you have a 5 % profit margin and the government levies a 5 % tax increase on your business .
Do you A ) suck it up and decide you are going to run your business at a 0 % profit margin or B ) do you increase your prices by 5 % to pay for your increased cost of doing business ?
Anyone who has spent 10 minutes in a business class would be able to tell you that in order to maintain a business you MUST have a minimum profit margin in order to survive and at least a marginal percentage in order to expand .
Obviously the answer is B you increase your costs to the consumer to make up the difference .
It becomes a cost of doing business and all costs of doing business are paid by those that purchase your product or service .
Now , the vast majority of banking users are the middle class therefore the vast majority of people that will be affected by this new fee will be the middle class .
To carry this to the logical conclusion we have to see this for what it really is and that is another attack on the true wealth and future of this nation the middle class .
The majority of small business creation is initiated by the middle class .
The more money taken out of the system directly affects the ability of the system to prosper .
The bottom line is we have had a systemic failure of the financial system in this country and in the wisdom of our federal government they steal money from the people to bail out organizations that were failing .
Then the federal government decides to repay that bail out by taking more money from the taxpayers , the American people , calling it “ crisis responsibility . ”
So in effect a crisis , arguably created by the federal government and the Federal Reserve , was bailed out by the American people by stealing more of their hard earned money and to “ force responsibility ” against those that were bailed out the federal government puts in a mechanism that takes more money from the American taxpayer .

The idea of passing an energy bill without cap and trade is gaining currency on Capitol Hill as Democratic leaders look at scaling back their agenda .
But it may run into trouble from liberal and coastal lawmakers who oppose more offshore drilling .
" Energy only " backers have portrayed such legislation as a path to a bipartisan achievement , particularly in the wake of the Massachusetts Senate election widely seen as a repudiation of the Democrats ' ambitious agenda .
But while liberal and coastal lawmakers might have been willing to allow more offshore drilling in exchange for a cap on greenhouse gas emissions , they are less likely to give up that leverage if a cap - and - trade plan is jettisoned .
" There are provisions that are more difficult for us to accept if they 're not part of a comprehensive bill , " said Sen. Ben Cardin ( D - Md. ) .
" In a broader package I am more understanding of some of the other regional concerns . "
Conversely , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , who is trying to put together a joint climate and energy bill has been telling Republicans that they cannot get the offshore drilling , nuclear and other pro-production measures they want without a cap .
" I can get every Republican for an energy independence bill , OK ?
But there are not 60 votes , " Graham said .
" You 're not going to get the nuclear power provisions you want unless you do something on emission controls . "
The energy bill ( S. 1462 ( pdf ) ) passed by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in June included a provision by Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) to open areas as close as 45 miles from Florida 's gulf coast to drilling .
The measure also includes a renewable electricity standard requiring utilities to provide 15 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2021 .
Environmentalists have called for a 25 percent standard by 2025 .
Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) still wants his committee 's bill to be paired with a cap - and - trade system .
But Dorgan has pushed for that legislation to be passed on its own , without the cap - and - trade plans being written in other committees .
" It will move us in the direction of a lower - carbon future , " Dorgan said .
He added that most areas of the outer continental shelf were opened to drilling a year ago .
His bill would open one of the last places that is still off limits .
" Offshore drilling is a carrot , " Dorgan said .
" It 's a carrot that 's already been consumed . "
But Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) is likely to filibuster any effort to expand drilling off the shores of his home state .
Without an emissions cap , liberal Democrats are even less likely to try to help override his objections .
" Enviros would revolt and could easily peel off enough liberal senators to keep them from getting 60 votes , " said a House Democratic leadership aide , " at least in the short term . "
Another House Democratic aide who described the energy - only bill as a likely compromise said it would still need the Florida senator 's support to pass .
The aide said Dorgan and Nelson would have to work out some sort of compromise about how far off the coast the drilling would be .
And prospects would not be much better in the House .
The House cap - and - trade bill did not include any offshore drilling .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) is a longtime foe of offshore drilling and once derided the idea that it might lower gas prices as a " hoax . "
Pelosi relented in the face of Republican pressure and high gas prices in 2008 and allowed a longstanding moratorium on coastal drilling to expire , although the GOP and oil industry have criticized the Obama administration 's progress on approving leases .
Though it is being shepherded by Dorgan , supporters see offshore drilling as a way to bring Republicans on board to an energy bill .
Energy companies say drilling is popular not only with the GOP but the general public as well .
" The American people overwhelmingly support these common - sense efforts , and leaders in Washington should too , " said Bruce Vincent , president of Swift Energy and chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association of America .
Supporters also note that liberals and environmentalists would still be getting a renewable energy standard that would cut greenhouse emissions by power plants .
But that wo n't satisfy most climate activists .
Daniel Weiss , director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress , said the RES in the Senate energy bill has too many loopholes .
Weiss looks at drilling as the political equivalent of dessert .
Measures to reduce greenhouse gases amount to eating your vegetables , he said -- not as pleasant , but better in the long run .
He worries that any such bill will have too much sugar and not enough broccoli .
" We need a balanced energy menu with vegetables and protein , not just a pile of Cool Whip , " Weiss said .

Proving that it has learned nothing from the arrogance of Chuck Prince and Citi 's subsequent demise , Citi plans crisis derivatives .
Credit specialists at Citi are considering launching the first derivatives intended to pay out in the event of a financial crisis .
The firm has drawn up plans for a tradable liquidity index , known as the CLX , on which products could be structured that allow buyers to hedge a spike in funding costs .
Like the untraded US rates liquidity index ( USRLI ) , the CLX is constructed as a sum of the Sharpe ratio – deviations from the mean divided by volatility – of various market factors , such as equity volatilities , Treasury rates , swap spreads , corporate bond swaption - implied volatilities , and structured credit spreads .
Citi will make the CLX tradable by using fixed historical values for the mean and volatility parameters , eliminating the need for costly recomputation from lengthy time series .
Although the design of the index serves as a proxy measure for liquidity , Terry Benzschawel , a managing director of quantitative credit trading strategy at Citi in New York and head of the team researching the product , says it also tracks more traditional measures such as bid-ask spreads , trading volumes and the USRLI .
He compares the potential impact of CLX to that of the interest rate swaps market .
" The great thing about the index is that it hedges your funding costs while being very simple to trade .
I believe it will reduce the systemic risk in the industry , akin to how the advent of swaps means people do n't worry about interest - rate exposures any more – they just pay a fee to hedge it , " he says .
Chris Rogers , chair of statistical science at Cambridge University , said the only participants able to sell CLX - based products would probably be those who are too big to fail .
" This is basically a kind of insurance product .
The main issue is : how good is the party issuing it ?
If it 's going to be paying out huge numbers in the event of a crisis , will it be able to meet it obligations ?
Insurers can buy reinsurance for their liabilities , but the buck has to stop somewhere – there 's a limit to how much a private insurer can pay out .
Only the government can cover unlimited losses , " he says .
This is yet another example that shows fundamental conceit .
Systemic risk is not lowered by the introduction of new derivatives , it is heightened .
The risk does n't go away after all , it is just shifted .
Moreover , since derivatives need speculative participants to provide trading liquidity , they actually ADD to overall systemic risk .

Engineered hybrids of bird and human flu strains have proven virulent in mice , raising the disturbing possibility that a natural recombination could be deadly to humans .
For years , researchers have worried that H5N1 avian influenza would mix with human flu viruses , evolving into a form that keeps its current lethality but is far more contagious .
That has n't happened – but the latest findings , published Feb. 22 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , show how easily it might .
" Fortunately , the H5N1 viruses still lack the ability to transmit efficiently among humans . "
However , this obstacle may be overcome by mixing with flu strains common in people , wrote researchers led by University of Wisconsin virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka .
" The next pandemic then will be inevitable . "
Current strains of H5N1 have infected 478 people since 2003 , and killed 286 of them .
It 's difficult to transmit in humans , requiring close contact with an infected person or animal .
In birds , however , H5N1 is far more contagious , and his killed tens of millions of fowl .
Cases have been concentrated in Africa and Eurasia , but as the swine flu pandemic demonstrated , any flu contagious to humans will likely go global , fast .
Influenza viruses swap genes easily , with co-infections turning animals into mobile petri dishes .
In 2008 , hoping to learn more about how H5N1 might evolve , researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention combined it with a common human flu strain .
The hybrids proved less virulent than the original bird flu strain .
Researchers wondered whether more contagious bird flu would necessarily always be less deadly in humans .
The PNAS findings suggest this may not be so .
The researchers engineered all 254 possible variants of hybridization between a deadly bird flu strain found in Borneo , and a human flu virus from Tokyo .
They identified three strains that , at least in mice , were both contagious and deadly .
A flu virus that kills mice wo n't necessarily kill humans , but the results are suggestive .
All three killer hybrid strains possessed a protein taken from the human strain .
Called PB2 , the protein appeared to help the virus survive in the mice 's upper respiratory tract .
As of now , bird flu stays in the lower respiratory tract , where it 's less likely to be casually transmitted .
The findings come as the World Health Organization meets to decide whether the swine flu pandemic has abated .
Though the pandemic has not proved as lethal as originally feared , it exposed how unprepared the world is for new influenza strains .
In May , Hong Kong University virologist Yi Guan , best known for finding the animal origin of SARS , was asked by Science Insider about the possibility of H5N1 and swine flu mixing .
" If that happens , I will retire immediately and lock myself " in a sealed laboratory , said Guan .

There is something really warming about eating good old classic recipes .
I almost feel nervous and get sweaty palms when I set myself the task of cooking an old kitchen classic .
I ’m not entirely sure of the reason , however I think it must be because everyone has their own pre-conceived ideas of what these dishes should look and taste like .
As most of the regular readers of the British Larder know there is nothing classic or traditional about my cooking .
I thrive on twisting and turning recipes to suit my taste and cooking abilities .
I suppose one could argue that I feel comfortable as a cook .
I believe that cooking is subjective and that there are no rights or wrongs in cookery , well o. k there are certain set rules and formulas that time and time again will deliver the same results .
I also believe that one cannot re-invent the wheel and cookery is pretty much like that too , but what we can do is modernize the recipes and good old favourites to prevent them from becoming … well shall I say extinct ” ?
I have Mrs Beeton ’s Cook book from 1913 and love it to bits , it ’s amazing to read the recipes and some of them have not changed at all , o.k just a few changes to ingredients but that ’s about it .
Talking about re-inventions and all that , I have never heard of January King cabbage before .
Now I can hear some people screaming at the computer screen asking where have I been all my life ?!?
Well I only discovered this gorgeous looking cabbage variety at a local farmers market .
I love cabbage and its one of those vegetables that has its ’ own character when cooked either quickly or slowly braised as per this recipe .
I like the buttery flavour and think it adds a unique and extra deliciousness to my version of a stroganoff .
I have chosen to use beef short ribs , though it was a bit of a struggle to find some at first .
Then after chatting to other chefs I found some at Whole Foods Market in London .
Cooking meat on the bone keeps the meet moist and adds flavour to the sauce .
The short ribs do require an hour and half cooking time but it ’s definitely worth the time and effort .
The result is a hearty full bodied classic dish .
Last but not least I served my storganoff with a carrot and grain mustard crush , it ’s perfect and the slight acidity of the mustard in the carrots sets the stroganoff sauce off beautifully .
This recipe is definitely a treasure and one to consider for a relaxing Saturday afternoon .
DUBLIN , Ireland ―
What started four weeks ago as a sex scandal that threatened to plunge Northern Ireland into crisis has ended in a new political agreement that strengthens the province ’s unique power - sharing arrangements .
British prime minister Gordon Brown and his Irish counterpart Brian Cowen flew to Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast before dawn yesterday to celebrate the interparty deal after 10 days of round - the - clock negotiations .
The agreement , worked out by the Protestant Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) and Sinn Fein , which aspires to a united Ireland , provides the last elements in the process of devolution painstakingly negotiated over two decades .
The power - sharing Northern Ireland government will take on police and justice powers on April 12 with the help of a British Government grant of £ 800 million ( $ 1.25 billion ) .
The communities will cooperate on the handling of contentious Orange Order parades through Catholic areas .
Unionists place much importance on the right of the Orange Order , which celebrates the defeat of Catholic rebels in 1690 by King William of Orange , to parade along traditional routes , even where they are offensive to Catholic residents .
Contentious parades have caused major rioting in past years .
The power - sharing threatened to crash in early January after an affair between 59 - year - old Iris Robinson , wife of Northern Ireland ’s First Minister Peter Robinson , and a 19 - year - old youth , Kirk McCambley , became public .
Robinson stepped down temporarily as First Minister while government lawyers investigated if financial irregularities existed in connection with his wife ’s affair , but he has been cleared .
The prospect of imminent disaster focused Catholic and Protestant politicians who had made the community government dysfunctional over squabbles about Irish language rights , north - south cooperation and loyalist parades .
Robinson and Sinn Fein Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness appeared together with the two prime ministers for a press concerence .
“ This might be the day when the political process comes of age , ” McGuinness said .
Robinson said that the deal , achieved after the longest round of continuous negotiations in the tortuous history of the peace process , would secure the power - sharing assembly “ for decades to come . ”
He added , “ politics is working , we are not going back to the past . ”
The normally humorless First Minister drew laughter when he speculated that if negotiating were an Olympic sport , “ we would enter a team , we would win a gold medal , and we would then start negotiating to decide what flag and anthem we would have . ”
While both prime ministers talked about the deal making history , the bitterness between the two top ministers was still on show at the press conference .
Robinson declined to shake hands with McGuinness when invited to do so by a reporter .
“ I ’m not into political stunts , ” he said .
The DUP leader has consistently refused to shake hands publicly with McGuinness , a former Irish Republican Army leader , though they privately shook hands last month when McGuinness sympathized with Robinson ’s family difficulties .
The devolution of policing and justice powers by the British Government is of critical importance to Sinn Fein , which persuaded its voters to accept the partition of Ireland partly on the basis that nationalists would jointly control law and order .
Before the Northern Ireland “ Troubles ” began 40 years ago , a majority unionist government controlled a paramilitary police force known as the Royal Ulster Constabulary .
The police force was demilitarized under direct British rule and renamed the Police Service of Northern Ireland ( PSNI ) to make it more widely acceptable .
According to the agreement , a six - member working group is to be established to provide local solutions that respect the rights of those who parade as well as nationalist residents .
“ This is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence , years of talks , weeks of stalemate , ” commented Brown , whose prospects in this year ’s British general election will have been improved by the success of negotiations he and Cowen have sponsored .
Cowen said he believed the deal laid the foundations for a new future “ built on mutual respect for people of different traditions , equality and tolerance and respect for each other ’s political aspirations and cultural expressions and inheritance . ”
The end of 120 hours of negotiations came just before midnight Feb. 4 when Robinson secured agreement from his assembly party .
He still faces opposition from a hard - line unionist faction , the Traditional Unionist Voice , led by Jim Allister .
Allister alleged that the DUP had caved in and accepted a deal they had originally rejected .
“ The deal has n’t changed , only the snowmen of the DUP , who melted once the heat came on , ” he said .
The city ’s first challenge was to win over the formidable minibus taxi industry , which moves 14 million people daily in a nation of 49 million , far more than the bus and rail systems combined .
It is perhaps the country ’s greatest success story of black entrepreneurship , though with a history of ruthless violence .
Experts estimate that hundreds , if not thousands , of people have died in “ taxi wars ” to control routes .
The city has sought to get the industry involved by offering taxi proprietors ownership of the bus operating company , but negotiations have dragged on , and some in the industry remain fiercely opposed .
After the bus line began running five months ago , along a 16 - mile route from Soweto to the central business district , a bus was fired on and a passenger and a policewoman on it were hit .
Gunmen shot at the home of Mrs. Moosajee , hitting her security guard in the neck .
And Vananda Khumalo , a taxi industry official and advocate for a deal with the city , was killed .
There have been no arrests , Mrs. Moosajee said .
The city has also faced steely opposition from suburbanites that some officials describe as a classic case of not - in - my - backyard resistance .
At a packed meeting in November 2008 , residents from the strand of stately , still mostly white communities along the heavily traveled Oxford Road shouted down city officials who were trying to describe proposed bus routes , including one that would use two of Oxford Road ’s four lanes for buses .
“ They just stood up and said , ‘ No , no , no , no ! ’ ” recalled Tessa Turvey , a resident married to a mining industry entrepreneur .
Mrs. Turvey has since honed a message in defense of her neighborhood , Saxonwold , where jacaranda trees arch over tranquil streets and homes are adorned with rose gardens , swimming pools and lush greenswards .
In a letter to the city , the neighborhood association ’s members welcomed a mass transit system but opposed what they considered hastily and ill - conceived routes that they said would pollute the air , cause traffic to spill onto side streets , increase crime and damage property values .
The way she saw it , her life had two roads :
Be a tenured professor or drive a bus .
Amy Bishop , the troubled neurobiology professor at University of Alabama , Huntsville , accused of shooting three colleagues dead , saw firsthand what happens to academics tossed out of the ivory tower — a job befitting a high - school dropout .
“ That ’s what happened to one guy that did n’t get tenure , and he is driving a courtesy shuttle , ” James Anderson , Bishop ’s husband , told The Post yesterday in explaining what may have prompted his wife to murder her colleagues .
“ His work later went on to help two guys win the Nobel Prize in chemistry , ” he added .
Bishop — who shot her brother dead in 1986 under murky circumstances and was questioned in 1993 over a mail bomb sent to her Harvard doctoral adviser — was being tossed from the prestigious science school at semester ’s end .
She feared she ’d end up like Douglas Prasher , a brilliant molecular chemist who had to abandon his research in 1994 when his funding dried up .
His colleagues went on to the win the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2008 based on his research .
Prasher currently drives the courtesy van for a Huntsville Toyota dealership .
“ There is always life after tenure , ” a shocked Prasher told The Post after learning that his misfortune had become a cautionary tale , even though his problem was with funding , not tenure .
Prasher said he never crossed paths with Bishop — whose tenure application was just rejected after she spent six years at the school .
Bishop had an attorney fighting her case and had other job prospects , her husband protested .
Anderson said it is still a mystery what actual “ trigger ” set off his wife , who neighbors told reporters was intolerant of noisy kids and even the ice - cream truck .
Anderson told the AP he had recently gone to a shooting range with Bishop but said he did n’t know where she got the gun used in her attack .
Anderson told the Chronicle of Higher Education that she may have received an e-mail , which he called a “ nastygram , ” last Friday confirming her tenure was rejected .
That same day she allegedly stormed into a faculty meeting firing a 9 mm handgun at six colleagues , including Biology Department Chairman Gopi Podila .
While Bishop , 44 , remains in police custody , her husband vehemently denied reports that his wife was behind the attempted bombing of her Harvard adviser , Dr. Paul Rosenberg , 17 years ago .
“ There were dozens of subjects of the investigation .
We were never suspects .
There were never any indictment and never any arrests , ” Anderson told The Post .
“ They were chasing every lead at the time , trying to find out what was going on and came up with nobody . ”
Somebody mailed Rosenberg , who reportedly was going to give her a poor evaluation , a package containing a pipe bomb , but he called cops before the device detonated .
“ We knew she had a beef with Paul Rosenberg .
And we really thought it was a really unbelievable coincidence that he would get those bombs , ” Sylvia Fluckiger , a lab tech who worked with Bishop told the Boston Globe .
Years earlier , a 20 - year - old Bishop shot dead her 18 - year - old brother with a shotgun in their Braintree , Mass . , home .
Although she fired three times , the local police — who employed Bishop ’s mother in the personnel department — believed her story that the shooting was an accident .
Much of the paperwork from the investigation has disappeared .
Families of the victims were outraged that Bishop was even hired by the University of Alabama in 2003 .
“ I think they need to do a little more investigation when coming down to hiring teachers and things like that .
Maybe looking a little deeper into their past about certain things , ” said Melissa Davis , whose stepmother , Maria Ragland , an associate professor , was killed .
In Huntsville , Anderson said their four children are “ barely hanging in there ” as they try to make sense of violence .
After the shooting , Bishop calmly called her husband asking to be picked up .
They had a date night scheduled .
They were going to get coffee .
Later , from the police station , she reportedly asked her husband if the kids had finished their homework .
“ We will comment in the near future , ” Anderson said .
“ Now I ’m asking everyone to back off and let us sort everything out . ”

A year later , Crist is headed to an inevitable defeat in the Republican primary for the Senate seat vacated by Mel Martinez ( R ) , doomed to lose to a candidate who has , in large part , based his campaign in opposition to Crist ’s support for Obama ’s stimulus legislation .
The message is resonating with Republicans across the nation — collaborate with the enemy , and you will be treated as a traitor .
ADVERTISEMENT
Bipartisanship , thus , is dead .
Republicans obviously have little interest in working with the administration or congressional Democrats to advance legislation .
Instead , they seek to delay , dilute and destroy .
Of course , this is actually the rational thing to do .
Despite the fervent wishes of the bipartisanship fetishists in D.C. , like David Broder , the fact is that the minority party has little political incentive to help the majority .
The key to regaining the majority is by convincing voters that the current majority is incompetent and incapable of delivering results .
So why should Republicans assist Democrats in notching up accomplishments ?
Republican obstructionism is aided by Senate rules allowing a small minority the ability to stymie the majority .
Democrats may have a dominant 3 - to - 2 ratio in the Senate , but that ’s not enough to deliver on their agenda .
Between obstructionist Republicans and a handful of corporate - bought small - state Democrats , the entire Democratic legislative program can be held hostage by filibuster .
The large Democratic majority looks ineffective , and those minority obstructionists are able to score cheap political points at the expense of the nation ’s well - being .
The filibuster rule has become so ingrained that actual filibusters are no longer even necessary .
Just the threat is enough to derail legislation .
That ’s great for Republicans — but bad for America .
The use of cloture voting in the U.S. Senate has increased steadily over the past 50 years , climbing exponentially over the decades .
Before 1970 , not a single session of Congress had more than 10 cloture votes to end a filibuster .
By the end of 2006 , the record was 58 .
Then Democrats took control of the Senate in 2007 , and we saw 112 in the last session alone .
Republicans have shown little interest in slowing down that unprecedented level of obstructionism in the current session .
In 1975 , the Senate reduced the filibuster threshold from 67 votes to 60 , so there ’s nothing preventing the Senate from taking another look at the practice .
I supported attempts by GOP senators in 2005 to eliminate the filibuster with their “ nuclear option , ” an effort that was unfortunately blocked , for the most part , by small - state senators who often hold the legislative process hostage to extract concessions .
Look no further than the current situation in which supposed “ fiscal conservative ” senators like Nebraska ’s Ben Nelson and Louisiana ’s Mary Landrieu Mary Loretta LandrieuBottom line A decade of making a difference : Senate Caucus on Foster Youth Congress needs to work to combat the poverty , abuse and neglect issues that children face MORE funneled hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid pork to their states in exchange for their votes .
Unsurprisingly , both Nelson and Landrieu were members of the “ Gang of 14 ” who blocked the GOP ’s effort to eliminate the filibuster .
If we ’re going to hold the majority accountable for its governance , it ought to have an honest shot at governing .
The filibuster makes the majority ’s failure inevitable , and that ’s undemocratic and counterproductive to our nation ’s best interests , making our nation ungovernable .
It ’s time to reduce the filibuster to a more manageable number — say , 55 votes — or eliminate it entirely .

But the president until now had avoided citing that until analysts were further along in their assessment of the group ’s activities and its ties to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the 23 - year - old Nigerian charged with trying to blow up the airliner .

“ We ’re learning more about the suspect , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ We know that he traveled to Yemen , a country grappling with crushing poverty and deadly insurgencies .
It appears that he joined an affiliate of Al Qaeda and that this group , Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , trained him , equipped him with those explosives and directed him to attack that plane headed for America . ”
Mr. Obama ’s comments indicated that he and the government largely accepted the accounts offered by Mr. Abdulmutallab since he was taken into custody and by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in a statement on the Web .
The National Security Agency had intercepted communications among Qaeda leaders months ago talking about an unnamed Nigerian preparing to attack , but the government never correlated that with information about Mr. Abdulmutallab ’s radicalization collected by embassy officials in Nigeria from the suspect ’s father .
On Saturday , the director of the National Counterterrorism Center , Michael E. Leiter , made his first public comments on the bombing attempt .
The center has come under sharp criticism for not connecting various warnings before the attempt .
“ The failed attempt to destroy Northwest Flight 253 is the starkest of reminders of the insidious terrorist threats we face , ” Mr. Leiter said in a statement .
“ While this attempt ended in failure , we know with absolute certainty that Al Qaeda and those who support its ideology continue to refine their methods to test our defenses and pursue an attack on the homeland . ”
Some changes have been made in the past week , and others are being forwarded to Mr. Obama for consideration .
The terrorism center has elevated several hundred individuals from a handful of countries , including Yemen and Nigeria , to be put on watch lists rather than merely being entered in a terrorism database .
Some of these individuals , as well as others who were already on the terrorism watch list , have now been placed on more selective lists that subject them to secondary screening before boarding a commercial airline flights , or that bar them from flying to the United States altogether , intelligence officials said .

Following my blithering about the iPad the other week , I found myself thinking about ebooks .
That 's my life for you .
A rollercoaster .
Until recently , I was an ebook sceptic , see ; one of those people who harrumphs about the " physical pleasure of turning actual pages " and how ebook will " never replace the real thing " .
Then I was given a Kindle as a present .
That shut me up .
Stock complaints about the inherent pleasure of ye olde format are bandied about whenever some new upstart invention comes along .
Each moan is nothing more than a little foetus of nostalgia jerking in your gut .
First they said CDs were no match for vinyl .
Then they said MP3s were no match for CDs .
Now they say streaming music services are no match for MP3s .
They 're only happy looking in the rear - view mirror .
Crackly warm vinyl sounds wonderful , but you can't listen to it on the bus , or squish it into a machine the size of a raisin .
And unless your MP3s are encoded at such a low rate that it sounds as though the band 's playing woollen instruments in a water tank , and provided you 're listening to some halfway decent music in the first place , your brain quickly cancels out any concerns about " lossiness " and gets on with enjoying the music .
I 've never quite understood the psychological makeup of the self - professed audiophile – the sort of person who spends £ 500 on a gold - plated lead and can't listen to a three - minute pop song without instinctively carrying out a painstaking forensic audit of the sound quality .
That 's not a music fan .
That 's a noise - processing unit .
Just as it was easy to dismiss MP3s until you 'd test - driven an iPod , so the advantages of an ebook really become apparent only when you use one .
Yes , there 's no " new book smell " , no folding the pages over , and if you drop it in the bath you 've ruined it – but on the other hand , the whole " electronic ink " malarkey actually works ( so you do n't feel as if you 're squinting at words made of light ) , downloading new books is easy , and it can store about 1,500 titles ; approximately 1,499 more than I could comfortably carry otherwise .
It can also read books aloud , which is great if , like me , you 've spent years wondering how the great works of literature might sound if recited by a depressed robot .
But the single biggest advantage to the ebook is this : no one can see what you 're reading .
You can mourn the loss of book covers all you want , but once again I say to you : no one can see what you 're reading .
This is a giant leap forward , one that frees you up to read whatever you want without being judged by the person sitting opposite you on the tube .
OK , so right now they 'll judge you simply for using an ebook – because you will look like a showoff early - adopter techno - nob if you use one on public transport until at least some time circa 2012 – but at least they 're not sneering at you for enjoying The Rats by James Herbert .
The lack of a cover immediately alters your purchasing habits .
As soon as I got the ebook , I went on a virtual shopping spree , starting with the stuff I thought I should read – Wolf Hall , that kind of thing – but quickly found myself downloading titles I 'd be too embarrassed to buy in a shop or publicly read on a bus .
Not pornography , but something far worse : celebrity autobiographies .
And coverlessness works both ways : pretentious wonks will no longer be able to impress pretty students on the bus by nonchalantly / demonstratively reading The Journals of Soren Kierkegaard , at least until someone brings out an ebook device with a second screen on the back which displays the cover of whatever it is you 're reading for the benefit of attractive witnesses ( or more likely , boldly displays the cover of The Journals of Soren Kierkegaard while you guiltily breeze through It's Not What You Think by Chris Evans ) .
I like the notion of this blunt technological camouflage , where it looks as if you 're doing one thing while you 're doing the exact opposite .
Here 's another idea .
Modern 3D cinema technology works by ensuring your left eye sees one image while your right sees another .
But they could , presumably , issue one pair of specs comprising two left - eye lenses ( for children to wear ) , and another with two right - eye lenses ( for adults ) .
This would make it possible for parents to take their offspring to the cinema and watch two entirely different films at the same time .
So while the kiddywinks are being placated by an animated CGI doodle about rabbits entering the Winter Olympics or something , their parents will be bearing witness to some apocalyptically degrading pornography .
The tricky thing would be making the soundtracks match .
Those cartoon rabbits would have to spend a lot of time slapping their bellies and moaning .
Anyway : eBooks .
They 're the future .
The only thing I 'd do to improve them is to include an emergency button that automatically sums the entire book up in a sentence if you could n't be arsed to finish it , or if your plane starts crashing and you want to know whodunit before exploding over the sea .
Ideally it'd shriek the summary aloud , bellowing something like " THE BUTLER DID IT " for potboilers , or maybe " THE SCULPTRESS COMES TO TERMS WITH THE DEATH OF HER FATHER " for highbrow fiction .
Which means you could effectively skip the reading process entirely and audibly digest the entire contents of the British Library in less than a month .
That 's ink - and - paper dead , right there .
The Washington Tragedy
Background
On the eve of the Civil War , Washington was a lively social and political place .
Everywhere construction was going on .
Like the entire nation itself , Washington was expanding .
Most of the public buildings were covered with scaffolding for construction or renovation .
Even the capitol dome was being replaced .
It seemed that the nation was of two minds : building up and tearing down , construction and destruction .
In one regard the city was still a frontier town .
Duels were carried out regularly , and most men--many of them Congressmen -- carried guns .
On the other hand , it was a civilized place , as well .
Politicians and their wives spent as much time in a whirl - wind of social activities as they did in the business of governing .
In addition , society was on the brink of American Victorianism , a mindset that would be particularly strong after the war between the states .
However , many attitudes on sexual behavior were still lingering out of the previous decade in which an " unwritten law " had taken shape .
In previous more puritan times all sin was a crime .
By the 1840s , however , while open sin was bad and disruptive , secret more discreet sin was tolerated .
This probably accounted for the rise of red - light districts , pieces of urban landscape where vice was allowed to grow and flourish as long as it was largely invisible to the wider public .
According to prevailing views of social leaders , there were two types of " bad people . "
There were those good people who upon occasion lapsed and did bad things .
They were generally tolerated and forgiven .
Then there were those who were sinful regularly , those professional vice providers and other irredeemable scoundrels ; they were the unforgiven .
As a carry - over from the Common Law , which was generally giving way to statutory law , the " unwritten law " allowed a good man the right to avenge the sexual dishonor of himself , his wife , daughter or sister .
Of course , the written law and judicial proceedings did not subscribe to this societal assumption of appropriate revenge .
Apparently , such distinctions were important as urban society brought more - and - more people into closer contact .
This was especially true in the political and cultural competitiveness of Washington D.C. on the eve of the Civil War .
President James Buchanan , the nations fifteenth president , was an amiable man apparently oblivious to how close the country was coming to splitting apart .
The previous administration , that of Franklin Pierce , had been somewhat gloomy because just before his inauguration Pierce 's eleven year old son had died in a train accident .
President Pierce never fully recovered from that loss .
On the other hand , President Buchanan ushered in a happier time .
Washington society seemed intoxicated over the spirit .
Sandwiched in between the gloom of the Pierce and the crisis of the Lincoln administrations the Buchanan presidency seemed Camelot .
Some contemporaries even claimed that this was the gayest administration the nation had ever experienced .
At a time when friendships and loyalties were about to be severely tested in the Civil War , Buchanan , and those with whom he surrounded himself , believed that personal attachments -- among husband and wives , friends , and colleagues -- were sacrosanct .
One of those close friends to the president was Daniel Edgar Sickles .
Characters
Dan Sickles had just recently been elected to Congress from New York 's powerful Tammany Hall organization .
He had been born in New York City in 1819 , an only child .
After attending private schools he eventually took up law and established acquaintances with influential people like Benjamin Butler and Martin Van Buren , a former president of the United States .
He became involved with Tammany Hall and was elected to the state legislature in 1847 .
For several years he was a " man-about - town " even being seen with the notorious Fanny White , a bordello madam .
Finally , in 1852 at the age of 33 , he seemed to settle down when he married Teresa Bagioli , a girl of 16 .
Very soon she had a baby , suggesting that the marriage might have been as much out of necessity as out of love .
In 1853 he was named Corporation Council or the main legal advisor to the city .
Due to influence of friends in high places he was appointed to assist James Buchanan , the future president , when that man was named Ambassador to England .
Dan and Teresa became very close friends to Buchanan while in London .
But Teresa did not like England and soon they were back in New York City where Sickle worked to have constructed Central Park .
In fact , all of his life he would think that urban park his greatest accomplishment .
He continued to work hard for Tammany Hall and when Buchanan was elected to the presidency Sickles followed as Congressman .
Dan and Teresa set up a house on fashionable Lafayette Square in Washington and became quite prominent in social circles .
Harper 's Weekly Magazine noted that " Mr. and Mrs. Sickles are universal favorites ; nowhere is there a more refined or generous welcome . "
Mrs. Sickles 's receptions , noted the New York Herald , were " always attended by the most presentable people in town . "
President Buchanan was known to come by for dinner often .
So did Philip Barton Key .
Philip Key came from a large and important family .
His father , Francis Scott Key , had been a district attorney in Washington from 1833 to 1841 .
At that time he unsuccessfully tried the man who attempted to kill President Andrew Jackson .
In that case , the first successful use of the insanity defense was used in America .
Of course , earlier while standing aboard a ship outside of Baltimore harbor watching a British bombardment during the War of 1812 he wrote a song that would become famous as the national anthem .
Philip studied law in Annapolis and followed his father 's foot steps and became a prominent lawyer in Washington .
Key married in 1845 but he and his three children were widowed ten years later .
He was an extraordinarily handsome man known for his wit and charm .
Soon he was a social lion of Washington society and became known to Dan and Teresa Sickles .
In fact , Dan Sickles was important in obtaining a political appointment for Key .
Since he was a widower , Key was frequently called upon by busy Congressmen to escort their wives to the endless social events .
Apparently everyone understood the " unwritten law " and a class of social eunuchs arose to be escorts for the wives of busy Congressmen .
That is how Philip Key and Teresa Sickles became more intimate , first as friends and then as lovers .
Event
The relationship between Key and Teresa deepened into a passionate love affair .
At first , they were seen together or at the same social events almost every night .
Only the most discerning were suspicious and the whisperings were surprisingly light for a gossip - hungary Washingtonian society .
Soon , Philip took up residence near the Sickles house in the center of town .
They began to " visit " almost everyday .
On several of these visits they made love in the parlor sitting room while servants busied themselves elsewhere in the house .
Slaves and servants were well aware of what was going on but dared not say a word to the Congressman .
Soon the liaison shifted to Philip 's apartments .
They accomplished this by Philip appearing outside the Sickles home signaling his desires and availability by waving a handkerchief .
Then Teresa , on the pretense of shopping or social visits , would leave the house and secretly make her way to Philip .
The following was taken from first - hand accounts given at the trial and recorded in the newspapers :
It was a dirty room in a rundown house in a squalid section of the city .
Its windows were closed tight against the February cold and its shutters barred the feeble winter sunlight .
a fire burned in the small hearth .
Some pieces of wood for it lay nearby .
The furnishings were sparse ; a simple bureau , a rumpled bedstead , and a basin with a pitcher .
Soiled towels were strewn about the room .
Through the connecting door , scattered about an adjoining room , were a comb , a pair of gloves , some cigarettes in a package on the mantel , a man 's winter shawl .
The bed and bedding there were wrinkled , too , as though no one had bothered to make it up for a week , or so .
She undressed -- taking off her black velvet cloak trimmed lace , the black velvet shawl trimmed with fringe , the plaid silk dress , her undergarments -- and now lay naked in the bed .
Waiting for him to appear .
Her dark hair was undone and draped across he pillow .
He entered the room .
What was that remark he had made about what he liked ?
" French intrigue and romance , with a good spice of danger in it ! "
He started to take off his clothes .
And what was that boast of his ?
" He only asked thirty - six hours with any woman to make her do what he pleased . "
He lay down next to her and they embraced .
Then they kissed and " did what is usual for a wicked woman to do . "
These meetings went on for months .
Since the business of Congress , especially the problems growing everyday on the impending split off of the South , Dan Sickles was oblivious to his young wife 's various trysts .
One day , in the midst of some very busy and trying work at the capitol , an anonymous letter arrived disclosing the adultery of his wife .
It read :
Dear sir with deep regret I enclose to your address the few lines but an indispensable duty compels me so to do seeing that you are greatly imposed upon .
There is a fellow I may say for he is not a gentleman by any means by the [ name ] of Philip Barton Key & I believe the district attorney who rents a house of a negro man by the name of Jno .
A Gray situated on 15th Street btw'n K & L streets for no purpose than to meet your wife Mrs. Sickles .
He hangs a string out of the window as a signal to her that he is in and leaves the door unfastened and she walks in and sir I do assure you he has as much the use of your wife as you have .
With these few hints I leave the rest for you to imagine .
Most Respfly
Your friend R. P. G .
At first , Dan Sickles went into denial and continued his work in Congress , and , against his wife 's objections , sought re-election .
For some inexplicable reason Philip and Teresa grew emboldened and took less precautions in their meetings .
The circle of those who knew what was going on began to widen .
Even President Buchanan became suspicious and cautioned the Congressman to show more attention to his wife and household .
However , it was only when his best friend , Samuel Butterworth , confirmed the rumors and suspicions that Dan Sickles finally realized the truth .
Sickles 's first reaction was to fall into a deep depression .
This soon gave way to fury .
He confronted his wife with the facts and was able to extract a written confession of the entire sordid affair in great detail .
Dan was particular enraged when it was disclosed that the very parlor in which the confessions came out was the initial and primary place for the illicit sexual meetings .
He forced Teresa to leave the house for New York .
After Teresa left Dan fell into an even deeper depression and all of his friends feared he was loosing his mind .
In the meantime , Philip was unaware of the disclosures .
He had not seen Teresa for nearly a week in spite of his handkerchief signals .
Everyone was strangely silent when he casually asked about the Sickles .
He continued to try to establish contact .
On one such occasion , February 27th 1859 , as Philip signaled from across the street , the depressed Daniel caught sight of him out of the window .
Congressman Daniel Sickles cracked .
Armed with two pistols , and accompanied by his best friend Samuel Butterworth , Sickles ran outside to confront Philip Key on the mainstreets of Washington D. C.
As the cuckold approached seducer with determined steps , Philip 's congeniality shifted to trepidation .
That turned to panic and pleading as the guns appeared .
It was so close to the White House that gunshots could be heard by the President .
Dan shot Philip in the chest .
Staggering backward the wounded man pleaded for mercy .
This was answered with another shot that the cinched the death .
A third was merely a coup de grace .
The wounded man was carried , gasping out his life , to a nearby men's club where he expired in a short time .
A coroner 's inquest was carried out immediately with the victim 's body still there propped up on an overturned chair .
Congressman Daniel Sickles had already turned to his friend and handed over the gun saying " My duty is done , my honor restored . "
Amidst nationwide attention Daniel Sickles went to trial for the killing of Philip Barton Key .
Everyone across the country referred to it as " The Washington Tragedy . "
Questions to Ponder
1 . What will be Sickles ' defence strategy ?
2 . From a nineteenth century perspective was Sickles justified in his actions ?
3 . What was the subsequent outcome and history of Sickles and his wife ?
4. Was Sickles a " bad man ? "
5. Was Teresa Sickles a " bad woman ? "
6. Was Key a " bad man ? "

Internet giant Google has said it may end its operations in China following a spate of attacks on e-mail accounts .
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said China must ensure a " secure " commercial environment for Google and other firms .
However , a Google spokesman said that it was still filtering its search results for China .
Nonetheless , the widely - known photograph of a man standing in front of a line of tanks during the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown - a highly sensitive subject in China - was available via google .cn.
Censorship
" The recent cyber intrusion that Google attributes to China is troubling to the US government and American companies doing business in China , " Mr Locke said in a statement .
The commerce secretary said the incident should be just as troubling to the Chinese government and added that he had personally raised the issue with Chinese officials .

He said during these discussions he had emphasised the importance that US President Barack Obama placed on " the full and free flow of information on the internet " .
Google has said that closing its google .cn site could mean it would shut its Chinese offices .
Google said the e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists were the primary target of the attack , which occurred in December .
The search engine has now said it will hold talks with the government in the coming weeks to look at operating an unfiltered search engine within the law in the country , though no changes to filtering had yet been made .
Google launched google.cn in 2006 , agreeing to some censorship of the search results , as required by the Chinese government .
It currently holds around a third of the Chinese search market , far behind Chinese rival Baidu with more than 60 % .
Email targeted
In a blog post announcing its decision , Google 's chief legal officer David Drummond said : " A primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists . "
The company said its investigation into the attack found two accounts of its online mail service - Gmail - appeared to have been accessed .
However , the attack was limited to accessing account information such as the date the account was created and subject line , rather than e-mail content , it said .
It said it had also discovered that the accounts of dozens of US , China and Europe - based Gmail users , who are " advocates of human rights in China " , appeared to have been " routinely accessed by third parties " .
It said these accounts had not been accessed through any security breach at Google , but " most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on users ' computers " .
At least 20 other large companies from a wide range of businesses were similarly targeted , it added .
Google 's decision to concede to China 's demands on censorship in 2006 led to accusations it had betrayed its company motto - " do n't be evil " - but Google argued it would be more damaging for civil liberties if it pulled out of China entirely .
Nearly 340 million Chinese people are now online , compared with 10 million only a decade ago .
Last year , the search engine market in China was worth an estimated $ 1bn and analysts previously expected Google to make about $ 600 m from China in 2010 .
But , unlike most markets , Google comes second in search in China .
In US trade on Wednesday Baidu 's shares were up 13 % , and Google 's down 0.57 % .

President Obama announced on Friday the award of $ 2.3 billion in tax credits for clean energy manufacturing — part of a broader push by his administration to stimulate job growth during the highest period of sustained unemployment in decades .
“ Building a robust clean energy sector is how we will create the jobs of the future . ” — Barack Obama
“ Building a robust clean energy sector is how we will create the jobs of the future , ” said Mr. Obama , according to prepared remarks .
The Labor Department reported on Friday that nonfarm payrolls shed 85,000 jobs in December , and the unemployment rate held steady at 10 percent , the highest level of joblessness since the early 1980s .
In a statement , Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said the tax credits would spur an additional $ 5 billion of private capital investment in the clean energy manufacturing sector .
The tax credits are worth up to 30 percent of the cost of each project , resulting in a total investment of about $ 7.7 billion .
Funding for the tax credits will come from the $ 787 billion economic recovery package approved by Congress in early 2009 .
Tax credits were awarded to 183 projects in 43 states , and will create more than 17,000 jobs in clean technology manufacturing , the White House said .
The projects must be in service by 2014 , but approximately 30 percent of them will be completed by 2010 , the administration estimated .
A partnership between the Treasury and Energy departments developed and instituted the tax credit program , which will support the manufacture of wind , solar and geothermal energy equipment as well as fuel cells , electric cars , and carbon capture and sequestration technology .
Recipients of the credits included Itron Inc. of Liberty Lake , Wash. , to manufacture “ smart meters ” for the residential market , and TPI Composites Inc. , to build a manufacturing plant in Nebraska to produce wind turbine blades .
According to TPI , the factory will create more than 200 new jobs .
PPG Industries of Pittsburgh received tax credits for its production of a coating to make solar cells more efficient , and to manufacture a tire tread component to improve fuel economy .
The tax credits will help restore American competitiveness in the clean energy sector , said Energy Secretary Steven Chu .
“ The world urgently needs to move toward clean energy technologies , and the United States has the opportunity to lead in this new industrial revolutions , ” Mr. Chu said in a statement .
The president got creamed in Massachusetts .
No amount of blaming this disastrous outcome on the weaknesses of the local Democratic candidate or her Republican opponent ’s strengths can gainsay that fact .
Obama ’s opportunistic search for win -win solutions to our health care concerns and our larger economic problems is leading to a lose - lose outcome for the president and the country .
The two issues that mattered on Election Day were the economy , which Obama has sold out to Wall Street — as quite a few disgruntled voters pointed out — and his plea to save health care reform , which the voters who had backed him for the presidency with a huge majority now spurned .
It is significant that it was the voters of Massachusetts who have now derailed the Democrats ’ efforts to revamp the country ’s health care system by denying them the necessary 60th vote in the Senate , for these voters know the subject well .
The federal proposal is based on their own state ’s model requiring people to obtain health insurance without the state doing anything to effectively control costs through an alternative to the private insurance corporations .
Lacking a public option , the cost of health care in Massachusetts , already the highest in the nation at the time of the plan ’s implementation , has spiraled upward .
Services have been curtailed , and many , particularly younger people , feel they are being forced to sacrifice to pay for a system that does n’t work .
Instead of blindly following the failed Massachusetts model , Obama should have insisted on an extension of the Medicare program to all who are willing to pay for it .
He squandered the opportunity to bring about meaningful health care change that the public would have supported had it been kept simple and just .
Instead , Obama gave away the store to medical profiteers .
They , in turn , hopelessly muddied the waters with well - funded scare advertising tactics that principled leadership on Obama ’s part could have thwarted .
A mere seven months ago , The New York Times / CBS poll found that 72 % of Americans “ supported a government - administered insurance plan — something like Medicare for those under 65 — that would compete for customers with private insurers . ”
Even half of those identified as Republican said they would back such a public plan , as would three out of four independents and 90 % of Democrats .
Instead of heeding that call by endorsing a serious extension of Medicare , along with increased subsidies for those who could not afford it , Obama played to the conservatives in Congress — and they rolled him .
If he was n’t prepared to make a breakthrough in health care , and that meant a reform program that would begin sooner rather than later , he should have put it on a back burner .
The furor over a very unsatisfactory plan drew attention from the far bigger crisis concerning the meltdown of the nation ’s economy .
By accepting and indeed expanding the Bush administration ’s strategy of throwing money at Wall Street , Obama ceded the populist label to the Tea Party Republicans who now pretend that a banking mess brought about by their radical deregulatory philosophy is not of their making .
It is the economy , stupid , and the sooner Obama grasps that , the better for his and the nation ’s prospects .
A new Wall Street Journal / NBC poll finds that “ Americans ranked job creation and economic growth as their clear top priority for the federal government , well above national security and deficit reduction .
Health care , Mr. Obama ’s top domestic priority in 2009 , now ranks fourth , closely trailing the deficit and government spending . ”
Of course , the public is right .
In the midst of the worst economic crisis in 70 years , why waste enormous political capital battling to pass a health care plan that is modeled on a proven failure in Massachusetts , as voters there clearly registered ?
Meanwhile , the president has dropped the ball in the effort to make bankers act responsibly by forcing them to forego outrageous bonuses and help homeowners stay in their homes .
Again quoting the message of that Wall Street Journal / NBC poll : “ The president ’s focus on health care amid heightened job concerns could be hurting his ratings .
At the one - year mark of his presidency , 35 % of Americans said they were ‘ quite ’ or extremely ’ confident he had the right priorities to improve the economy , down from 46 % at midyear . ”
The Journal noted that a majority disapproved of the government ’s response to the financial crisis , adding , “ The related problem for Mr. Obama is the public ’s lingering anger about the bailouts of 2008 and 2009 , which helped boost bank profits even as unemployment grew — a toxic political problem . ”
To salvage his presidency , Obama must reverse course and make solving the “ toxic political problem ” of Wall Street greed that ’s bankrupting the country his highest priority .
One of the Moscow photo- centers has held an exhibition called “ The Itelmens – Indians of Russia ” .
Itelmens are a small ethnic group , who are original inhabitants of the Kamchatka peninsula .
Their population today ( speaking only of pure - blooded Itelmens ) is about 1500 .
Their name is indeed a Russian - adapted pronunciation of the ethnically correct “ itenman ” which means “ existing ” or “ living here ” .
A number of anthropological studies revealed that the Itelmens ’ closest genetic relatives are Indians of the Tlingit tribe resident in Alaska .
And that ’s not a surprise – they ’ve settled here before the Bering Strait separated Asia from North America .
Both of them have the common god – Kutkh raven – the creator of the Earth and every living thing on it .
The other most typical god for the locals was Mitg – “ master of the sea ” , who was believed to gift people with the main food – fish .
Fish was indeed the pivot of the Itelmens ’ nutrition , they pickled , dry - salted and smoked it to provide the tribe with the supply of food .
Itelmens have also a lot of in common with the other famous Indian tribe of Navajo .
Itelmens together with Koryaks , the other indigenous people , reside in the Kamchatka Krai of Russia .
Their features are more likely to the Europeans .
Despite they represent the minority in population structure , Itelmens consider themselves a kind of aristocracy comparing with Koryaks .
Probably , that ’s because historically they were occupied with various crafts , but not hunting and gathering .
Nowadays they are much more educated than the other indigenous ethnic groups of Kamchatka .
But still they have n’t gone far from the primitive communal system .
The other special and rare thing is the Itelmen language .
In the beginning of the 20th century it was taught in local schools with one specific – it used Roman letters .
When in 1936 peoples living on all Soviet territories were forced to turn to the obligatory use of the Cyrillic alphabet .
Itelmen teachers have n’t acknowledged this reform and thereby the language was n’t taught in official schools any more .
Nowadays it ’s dying extremely fast – only 900 people speak Itelmen language as native .
The mentioned photo-exhibition was opened by the present Itelmen shaman and the ethnic folklore group .
In an interview with the Times , John Sauven , director of Greenpeace UK suggests that the IPCC needs a new chairman other than The Love Guru .
But , in a recent press release , it looks like the IPCC is digging in their collective Nobel Laureate heels .
Meanwhile , news of newspaper clippings in IPCC AR4 peer reviewed research .
With quotes like these coming from Pachy , he ’s quickly running out of supporters who have been looking past his blown credibility .
Here ’s a quote from the Love Guru himself in a Financial Times interview today :
They are people who say that asbestos is as good as talcum powder – and I hope they put it on their faces every day …
( h/t to Andrew Bolt for that one ) Send in the clowns !
Maybe he ’s referring to the makeover suggested by the National Post ?
John Sauven , director of Greenpeace UK , said that Dr Pachauri should have acted as soon as he had been informed of the error , even though issuing a correction would have embarrassed the IPCC on the eve of the Copenhagen climate summit .
…
The IPCC needed a new chairman who would hold public confidence by introducing more rigorous procedures , Mr Sauven said .
“ The IPCC needs to regain credibility .
Is that going to happen with Pachauri [ as chairman ] ?
I do n’t think so .
We need someone held in high regard who has extremely good judgment and is seen by the global public as someone on their side .
“ If we get a new person in with an open mind , prepared to fundamentally review how the IPCC works , we would regain confidence in the organisation . ”

Around Afghanistan
22 February 2010
“ Johnny Boy ” Captain John Holland was walking out to the aircraft just as I arrived at the flight line .
Captain Holland asked , “ Are you ready ? ”
“ Yes Sir . ”
The Marjah offensive — billed as the biggest US / NATO / Afghan assault on the Taliban ever — had begun .
With it , the attention of nearly all the reporters covering Afghanistan is focused on Marjah .
Yet fighting continues across the country , in provinces with names unfamiliar to most people .
Men and women are wounded .
Some die .
Some are saved by dedicated medical crews , and by the pilots who fly into combat to ferry wounded to some of the best trauma facilities in the world , right here in Afghanistan .
This story is about the people who care for our troops , wounded correspondents , and many other people , day in , day out .
The C -130J can be outfitted to perform many sorts of missions , one of which is medical evacuation , which they call “ aerovac . ”
The flight medics say that starting from scratch and not rushing things , they can outfit the aircraft for aerovac in about 45 - 60 minutes .
This particular C-130J crew had already taken me on a “ Special Delivery ” mission : a night parachute resupply near the Turkmenistan border .
Pre-flight preparations and checks are exhaustive .
SSGT Gabe Campbell took me to the roof of the aircraft to explain a few procedures .
Gabe cautioned that when walking on top , one should make sure to stay within the black lines .
The airplane is big , and the flight line is made of concrete .
People have fallen off the aircraft ( and continue to do so ) , though today was sunny , dry and not windy .
But imagine doing these checks on a dark , freezing , windy night , on the icy fuselage of a giant C - 17 .
I had never been atop a C - 130 and the sun was in full cooperation for good photographs .
“ People at home will like this , ” I said to Gabe .
We crawled back down into the cockpit .
Specialists of various sorts were loading all kinds of gear , most of which was so foreign to me that it might as well have been space gear .
TSGT Matt Blonde said the gear weighs about 800 pounds and has the capabilities of a hospital intensive care unit .
There are only about 3,500 tigers left in the wild .
If action is not taken now , in a couple of decades the tiger will fade away into extinction .
We must help provide a voice for all tigers left in the wild and let world leaders know we will not stand for this fate to befall upon the lord of the jungle .
Signing this petition will let the Obama Administration know we demand action .
He must waste no time in pressuring world leaders to step up enforcement of anti-poaching laws and protect what is left of Mother Earth 's tiger population .
More information about the plight of the tiger can be found on the World Wildlife Fund website .
Dear President Obama :
The world 's tiger population is in dire need of your administration 's help .
If action is not taken now to end poaching and habitat loss , the tiger will face the same fate as the dinosaurs and dodo bird - extinction .
We can not let this happen .
Currently there are only an estimated 3,500 tigers left in the wild .
Every year their numbers are decimated from poaching , loss of land and food , and human ignorance .
But you can help save the tigers by pressuring world leaders into increasing their government 's enforcement of anti-poaching laws and implementing quick and decisive conservation efforts .
Not long ago , voices of opposition over Canada 's annual seal slaughter persuaded the EU into banning the import of all seal products .
With your help we can provide the same sort of victory to the tigers left on the planet and end poaching and habitat loss , and therefore provide hope and life to the lord of the jungle .
But this action can not wait .
Please act now and promote tiger conservation before it is to late .
Thank you .

The little girl who had eight limbs and was worshipped as a deity starts school
Brave : Lakshmi Tatma , dressed in her school uniform and standing proudly on her own two feet , smiles at her home in Jodhpur earlier this month
She was born with a unique body - eight limbs and two torsos fused at the hips .
Now Lakshmi Tatma , the Indian toddler whose plight touched the world , has grown up and started school .
Two years after a ground - breaking operation to separate her from a parasitic twin , Lakshmi is a lively and bubbly four - year - old .
She loves playing cricket with her older brother , has a tendency to boss around her newfound friends and remains firmly a daddy 's girl .
' When I think of the way she was , never in a million years would Lakshmi have been able to go to school or have the life she does today , ' said her mother Poonam , 26 .
' All the things she 's capable of now were impossible two years ago .
' I often try to think what she might be like today if she had n't had the operation - she could n't even sit up before and now she runs around like other children . '
Born in a dusty farming village in India 's poorest state , Lakshmi was revered as a deity and worshipped from birth .
Villagers , who believed she was the reincarnation of the Hindu goddess of wealth and fertility , would seek her blessing daily and leave gifts at her bedside .
But Lakshmi's resemblance to her mythological namesake came at a terrible price .
She could not walk , stand , or even sit .
The little girl was joined to a headless parasitic twin that had stopped developing in her mother 's womb .
Doctors were convinced she could not have survived into adulthood .
Now fully recovered from the 27 - hour operation to save her , Lakshmi is almost unrecognisable from her former self .
Beneath the surface , however , lurk a series of medical problems that threaten her future and will require years of surgery .
Six months after the complex operation to remove Lakshmi 's parasitic twin , doctors discovered she had developed scoliosis , or a curvature of the spine .
Without a complex operation to correct her spine doctors have warned her back will be forced into increasingly severe deformities as she grows , possibly leaving her disabled .
Separately , Lakshmi requires an operation to ' detether ' her spine after it was discovered she was born with abnormal tissue connecting the spinal cord to her nervous system .
In a further operation orthopaedic surgeons must perform a procedure to ' close her hips ' , which are set too far apart and result in an unusual ' gaited ' walk .
Miracle recovery : Lakshmi plays with her younger sister Saraswati as her mum Poonam looks on at their home this month
Finally , plastic surgeons will need to find a way to create buttocks for Lakshmi , which did not form in the womb because of the unique way she was connected to her parasitic twin .
In the same operation surgeons will have to fix related problems with her bladder and intestines .
' Lakshmi has come such a long , long way but we 're very scared for the future , ' said her mother Poonam .
' At one time we never imagined she would look so healthy , so we are very grateful for all the help we 've had .
' But we can't bear the thought that all this help could be undone if we can't find a way to get the extra operations she needs .
' The charity that looks after her cares for 500 other children as well .
It does not have the funds to pay for these operations and we have no money either .
' The hospital that operated on her before has promised to help but they cannot correct her spine because it is such a specialised operation .
' All we want is for her to be a normal child .
She has had her operation but even now she can't walk or move normally .
Her feet do n't come together properly and when she walks it hurts . '
Despite the threat to her future , Lakshmi 's life today is a world away from the circumstances of her birth .
Daddy 's girl : Lakshmi and her dad Shambu at their home this month .
Lakshmi's parents are still fearful for her future , despite the success of the operation
Born to impoverished parents in the frequently lawless state of Bihar , in India 's volatile northeast , Lakshmi faced an uncertain future until a wealthy doctor heard of her plight and offered to operate on her for free .
Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Sharan Patil , owner of the Sparsh Hospital in Bangalore 2,000 miles south , travelled to Lakshmi 's remote village in 2007 to meet the child and offer her parents the chance of a lifetime .
After more than a month planning the separation , Dr Patil 's team attempted the first operation of its kind in the world .
Hundreds of journalists camped outside the hospital throughout the 27 - hour surgery .
Lakshmi's fame , having spread from her tiny village around the world , prompted Sucheta Kriplani Shiksha Niketan ( SKSN ) , a charitable school looking after disabled children in the desert state of Rajasthan , to offer her parents a place to live and the chance of an education for Lakshmi and her brother Mithilesh .
As she was : Lakshmi as a baby , with her conjoined twin still attached
Dr Bhairoon Singh Bhati , the secretary of SKSN , said : ' Lakshmi is a special case for us .
She 's a very challenging case because you can never tell from her medical history when she might next fall ill .
' Her scoliosis is an example of the problems Lakshmi faces because we had no way of knowing she would develop a curvature of the spine .
' Similarly , despite all the problems she still faces we have no way of knowing what may crop up in the future .
' The biggest difficulty caring for Lakshmi is that she 's a unique case - there 's never been a child like her before so we have nothing to refer back to . '
Under Dr Bhati's guidance Lakshmi has started school , joining her elder brother as the only members of their family to ever receive an education .
Her father Shambu , 28 , said : ' I believe with all my heart that Lakshmi is indeed a goddess .
The operation removed her extra legs so that she can lead a normal life but she is not a normal child .
' She 's special , I think anything is possible for her .
I 'd like her to be educated so she can become a teacher .
Then she can pass on what she knows to other children . '

Who Has the Longer Pipeline ?

The Global Sisterhood Network was created back in 1997 , specifically to unify the efforts of feminists from around the world in the struggle to improve women 's lives .
Back on October 23 2004 , we implored British Prime Minister to break ranks with US President George Bush and intervene to save the life of long - time friend of Iraqis , Margaret Hassan .
We also implored Margaret Hassan 's abductors to spare her life and return her unharmed to her grieving family .
Eight weeks further on , evidence indicated that Margaret Hassan 's abductors had carried out their threat to kill her .
Margaret 's death in such cruel circumstance indelibly stains Iraq 's sands , but neither her murder , nor our tears for her passing , will ever wash away the injustice of this war .
The infamy of Margaret 's unwarranted and cowardly murder is also the shame of the spineless politically - elected allies of Bush Jnr who failed to lift a finger to rescue Mrs Hassan because it was not in their newly defined " national interest " as they toed the line with the US President in his fake war against terrorism .
History will be the judge of Bush Jnr and his allies conducting a genocidal war against our Muslim sisters and brothers , but in the words of Australian folk singer Judy Small , " they do not speak for me " .
GSN has co-opted Judy 's " me " to refer to feminist collectives which gather in every corner of the planet to resist today 's insane and barbaric injustices , and as a reminder that war - mongering political leaders do not speak for GSN - neither now , in the past , nor in the future !

Fast Track Interview
Adrian Bye : We ’re here with Derek Sivers , who founded CD Baby .
He has quite a story .
Derek , take it away by telling us about yourself .
Derek Sivers : I ’m a musician really .
When I was 14 years old , I decided that I was going to do nothing but music for life .
I ’ve been making a full - time living in music since 1992 .
Around 1997 , I was selling my own CD at live shows and had sold about 1,500 copies .
I decided I wanted to try to sell it online .
At the time , I was doing this radio campaign , and my CD was at number one at college radio stations in New Mexico , Maine and Alaska .
I wanted to sell the CD online so people from those places could buy it .
It was a very different online world in 1997 .
There was no PayPal to accept online payments .
Amazon only sold books .
As a musician , there was literally not a single online place where you could sell your CD , except for eBay , but that ’s not really where people shopped for music .
I called the big online record stores and asked if I could sell my CD through them .
They said , " We ’re just the frontends to the major label ’s distribution system .
The only way you can be for sale on CDNOW , for example , is if you ’re signed through a major distribution . "
I said , " Ca n’t I just send you a box of CDs , and you sell it and pay me ? "
They just laughed and said , " Look , kid .
It does n’t work that way . "
I never really meant to start a business .
I just set up CD Baby to scratch my own itch to sell my own CD because there was nowhere else to do it .
I went through three months of hell to get my own credit card merchant account on my band ’s website .
Then I had to learn how to create an online shopping cart , which also was pretty difficult in 1997 .
After three months of hard work , I had a Buy Now button on my website .
That ’s when some of my fellow musicians in New York said , " Hey , could you sell my CD through that ? "
I said , " Sure , I guess . "
What later became CD Baby really was me doing a favor for some friends around New York .
Adrian Bye : How big did CD Baby grow ?
Derek Sivers :
It had 10 or 20 musicians on it at first .
Since I was the only one doing anything like that , word - of - mouth was spreading around to musicians that , " If you want to sell your CDs online , there ’s this guy , Derek , who can hook it up . "
Talk about business startup environments .
There was just no competition .
I was the only guy that would get your CD up and selling online .
Within a few years , CD Baby was the largest seller of independent music online .
By the time I sold it 10 years later in 2008 , we had done about $ 100 million in sales for 150,000 musicians .
Adrian Bye : What were sales per year ?
Derek Sivers : About $ 20 million with a net profit of about $ 4 million a year .
Adrian Bye : Nice .
Then you sold it for $ 22 million ?
Derek Sivers :
A lot of people assume the reason you ’re doing something is for the money and the reason you want an exit is for the money .
For me , it was neither .
I started CD Baby as a favor for friends .
I did n’t think there was any money in this .
It ’s the same thing with getting out .
It was a healthy profit of $ 4 million a year , but I did n’t really need the money .
I had no investors , so it was 100 percent mine .
In 2007 , I did a complete rewrite of the software .
I fixed all of the mistakes , bugs and all of my regrets , and I made this amazing version of everything I ever wanted the website to be .
I launched it , and it went well .
Then I had this sense of completion like " I ’m done .
I do n’t know what else to do with this ‘ thing ’ . "
It got to the point where I felt my clients were actually more ambitious than I was .
They wanted to grow their careers , and I did n’t want to grow anymore .
Seth Godin , the author of a bunch of books like the Purple Cow , has been a mentor to me over the years .
When I told him about this situation , he encouraged me to sell .
He said , " You know , if you care about your clients and your company , you should sell . "
It was the idea that I was doing my company a disservice by remaining at the helm when I was feeling completely unambitious about it .
Adrian Bye : I read somewhere that you had the company completely automated by that point .
You could have just sat back and let it keep going , right ?
Derek Sivers : Exactly , and that ’s what I was doing for the rest of 2007 and 2008 .
I had n’t even been to the office in a few years at that point .
It was just going .
Adrian Bye : Could you have kept running the company fairly comfortably and generating $ 4 million profit a year the way it was ?
Derek Sivers : I could ’ve .
I was prompted to sell because I had three offers in one week .
For the entire time I was running the company , some VC firm or competitor would offer to buy the company every month or so .
I always just shooed them away and said , " No . " I did n’t even entertain the notion then .
But in one single week in January 2008 , I got three calls .
I told them all , " No . " Later that weekend , I started thinking " I ’ve just been saying , ‘ No , ’ for 10 years but maybe … " I called them all back and said , " Yes . "
I then let them bid against each other .
I chose Disc Makers to buy the company .
Amazon was in the running and was actually willing to offer much more money , but I ’d known Disc Makers for seven years , and they had already been dealing with independent musicians for many more years than that .
I felt they would do a better job of taking care of my clients by knowing my clientele and understanding them better than Amazon .
Yes , I chose Disc Makers for less money because I just felt my clients would be in better hands .
Adrian Bye : Was it a lot less money ?
Derek Sivers :
It ’s hard to say because we were still negotiating with Amazon .
There was no final offer , but it was many millions less .
After a certain point , what does it really matter ?
What ’s the difference between $ 22 million and $ 32 million ?
I decided to give it all away anyway , so it does n’t really matter .
Adrian Bye :
You decided to give all the money away ?
Derek Sivers : Yes .
After we had a handshake deal and agreed upon price , there were a few months of paperwork before the deal was done .
I was talking with my lawyer and accountant and feeling a little overwhelmed with " What do you do with $ 22 million ? "
I told them , " I do n’t even really want the money .
I want it all to go to charity anyway .
I just want to know that I do n’t have to get a job at some point later in life .
I want to know that I ’m taken care of , but I think it could be harmful for me to have $ 20 million . "
They told me about the Charitable Remainder Unitrust .
It ’s a charitable trust you can set up that pays the settler 5 percent of its value per year for life .
Then when you die , it all goes to charity .
It ’s usually set up by people at retirement age , who want to give everything away but also make sure they still have a little trickle coming in to help pay for their basic cost of living .
I just set that up decades earlier than most people do .
Months before I sold the company , I set up the charitable trust and transferred the company ’s ownership into the trust .
When Disc Makers bought the company , they did n’t actually buy it from me .
They bought it from the trust ; all of the money would go into the trust tax - free , which made no difference to me except it means that millions more will go to charity in the end .
Then I just get paid this 5 percent trickle for the rest of my life , which is enough for me .
The charity is set up for music education , so it ’s all going to go to music education when I die .
Adrian Bye : That ’s really interesting .
I ’ve never heard a story like this .
Derek Sivers :
Oh , thanks .
You never have to do things the normal way .
Maybe it ’s because I ’ve been a rebellious musician my whole life , but I did n’t start my company in the normal way .
I did n’t run it in a normal way .
We ’re all free to shape the world in our image , and I do n’t want $ 20 million .
You could n’t pay me to own a Ferrari .
I do n’t want a 19 - bedroom mansion .
I think that would be horrible .
I just want a decent life , so I liked the idea of getting as much of it out of my hands as possible as long as I was taken care of for life .
Adrian Bye : Can you undo it if you change your mind ?
Derek Sivers :
No , I can ’t .
It ’s done .
When I signed the company into the charity months before the company was sold , it was gone and no longer mine .
The money is not mine , and I ca n’t get it back if I want to .
I ’m actually doing the same thing for my new company .
I set up a trust first , and the trust is actually starting the new company and assigning me as the Director of it , so I ’m not the owner of that one either .
A charitable trust owns that company as well .
Adrian Bye : What I ’m having trouble reconciling is that you ’re a guy who has built a $ 20 - million business .
You sold it and made a lot of money .
You are going to start another business .
It ’s not like you ’re working in a Starbucks or something like that .
The impression you give is that you ’re a laid - back guy , but with all you have done , you ca n’t be that laid - back .
Derek Sivers :
Oh , no .
I ’m definitely not laid - back .
I use money as a barometer of measuring the value of what I ’m doing .
If the public is finding it valuable , they ’ll open their wallets to pay for it .
Money inspires me , but I also realize I did n’t necessarily want it for myself .
The idea of earning money and giving it to others excites me more than earning it and keeping it for myself , which makes me feel kind of icky .
I have always been a workaholic , but it ’s separating the idea of needing to keep the money from being ambitious .
You can be ambitious without wanting money .
Adrian Bye :
You did n’t have any funding for your first company .
Now , you ’ve given your money away .
Are you going to have funding for your next company or is it going to be built from the ground up as well ?
Derek Sivers :
It will be built from the ground up .
I did set up the new trust to transfer a small amount of money around $ 5,000 into a fund of the trust .
That small amount will be all that ’s in there to set up the new company .
If my first little experiment does well , there ’ll be funds in there for the next one .
I ’m going to always aim to build a company without any investors , unless I do something like start an airline , which I do n’t really see happening .
I ’m happy working on a really small - scale .
I never really wanted to start a grand company and raise many millions of dollars to start something huge .
I like the idea of tinkering with small things that do n’t need funding .
Actually I started CD Baby with only $ 500 – $ 99 was for a copy of Dreamweaver to build the site , $ 20 for my first month of web hosting and then $ 375 for the SSL Certificate through VeriSign .
It actually lost money that first month ; I only made $ 300 the first month .
The second month in business I made $ 700 , and that was profitable .
I probably only made $ 1,000 in my eleventh month in business .
It grew really slowly , but I was net profitable .
I ’m cool with that kind of slow growth .
My new company , Muckwork , is a remote assistance firm .
What ’s really fascinating to me is this combination of not trying to do everything myself but working with other people to get things done .
It ’s the idea of the virtual assistance firms where people help you as an assistant by the hour or literally by the minute for whatever you need .
That assistant sits at a computer somewhere in the world , and you outsource the things you need help with to them instead of hiring a person to sit next to you in your office working 9:00 to 5:00 for 40 hours a week .
I am setting up this virtual assistance firm for musicians with people working from home worldwide that are already well - trained to help musicians .
Whether it ’s booking gigs , copywriting songs or updating MySpace pages , a musician can ask somebody from Muckwork to help them with it .
I ’m going to do Muckwork as an experiment in crowdsourcing as well .
I ’m going to see if I can do a company with no employees and have everybody , even the management , be freelancers who are n’t bound to me but want to do the task .
Adrian Bye :
Do you intend to build an office for Muckwork or are you going to be traveling around the world while working on this ?
Derek Sivers : I ’ve been living the laptop life for a few years , and I really like it .
I like the idea of living for a few years each in different countries .
I ’m challenging myself for my next company to have no office , no employees and just have the system set up from day one so everybody is working as freelancers from home .
It might be a failure , but I might learn a lot of good stuff along the way .
It ’s worth a try .
Investigators believe some kind of religious ritual may be behind the discovery of the remains of more than 400 dead animals at a house in Philadelphia .
The remains include deer , turtles and other animals .
Officer George Bengal , director of law enforcement at the Pennsylvania SPCA , said investigators spent hours combing through the home in the city 's Feltonville neighbourhood on Wednesday .
He says the animals had apparently been used in some kind of religious ritual , according to the Philadelphia Daily News .
Authorities are trying to find the people who rented the home .
Topics
“ There was a time when Soviet science was in a desperate state and Belyaev ’s foxes were endangered , ” said Ray Coppinger , a dog biologist at Hampshire College in Massachusetts who tried to obtain some of the foxes to help preserve them .
But the animals seem to have left Russia only once , for Finland , in a colony that no longer survives .
There was far more to Belyaev ’s experiment than the production of tame foxes .
He developed a parallel colony of vicious foxes , and he started domesticating other animals , like river otters and mink .
Realizing that genetics can be better studied in smaller animals , Belyaev also started a study of rats , beginning with wild rats caught locally .
His rat experiment was continued after his death by Irina Plyusnina .
Siberian gray rats caught in the wild , bred separately for tameness and for ferocity , have developed these entirely different behaviors in only 60 or so generations .
The collection of species bred by Belyaev and his successors form an unparalleled resource for studying the process and genetics of domestication .
In a recent visit to Novosibirsk , Dr. Brian Hare of the Planck Institute used the silver foxes to probe the unusual ability of dogs to understand human gestures .
If a person hides food and then points to the location with a steady gaze , dogs will instantly pick up on the cue , while animals like chimpanzees , with considerably larger brains , will not .
Dr. Hare wanted to know if dogs ’ powerful rapport with humans was a quality that the original domesticators of the dog had selected for , or whether it had just come along with the tameness , as implied by Belyaev ’s hypothesis .
He found that the fox kits from Belyaev ’s domesticated stock did just as well as puppies in picking up cues from people about hidden food , even though they had almost no previous experience with humans .
The tame kits performed much better at this task than the wild kits did .
When dogs were developed from wolves , selection against fear and aggression “ may have been sufficient to produce the unusual ability of dogs to use human communicative gestures , ” Dr. Hare wrote last year in the journal Current Biology .
Dr. Hare believes that wolves probably have the same cognitive powers as dogs , but their ability to solve social problems , like picking up human cues to hidden food , is masked by their fear .
Dogs , after their fear is removed by domestication , see humans as potential social partners , not as predators , and are ready to interact with them .
But though selection for tameness was probably the first step in domesticating dogs , Dr. Hare said , they may well have adapted to human societies in other ways , with the smarter dogs leaving more progeny .
Now that unit testing and test - driven development have hit the mainstream , more and more companies are beginning to embrace these agile practices .
What is n’t always clear is which practice is most useful in which scenario , and how alternatives like state - based testing and non-automated human - tester activities can be used most cost - effectively .

T he new year is less than three weeks old , but the Canadian Internet story of 2010 may have already taken place .
Ridiculed by political parties and analysts , the growth of the Canadians Against Proroguing Parliament Facebook group , which now has more than 200,000 members , provides the clearest indicator yet of how poorly the Canadian political community understands social media and digital advocacy .
When the Prime Minister announced he was proroguing parliament in the midst of the holiday season , political commentators applauded the tactic , confident few Canadians would notice or care .
In less than three weeks , Christopher White , a university student from Alberta , proved the experts wrong , building the largest Facebook group in the country , one that 's the focal point for national discussion and voter discontent .
As the group began to take flight , it was surprising to see political leaders and analysts blithely dismiss the relevance of Facebook advocacy .
Editorials pointed to other large groups to demonstrate the group 's irrelevance , noting that joining a Facebook group was too easy – just click to join – to mean much of anything .
This represents a shocking underestimation of the power of digital advocacy , which today is an integral part of virtually every political or business advocacy campaign .
First , the criticism is particularly surprising since Canada has experienced this form of advocacy before , and it has proven effective .
In 2007 , the Fair Copyright for Canada group I launched grew to 90,000 members and was credited by some with convincing the government to more carefully examine its proposed bill .
The following year , a group opposing proposed changes to Ontario 's rules for young drivers reached 150,000 members and persuaded Premier Dalton McGuinty to drop the amendments .
Second , anyone who tells you that building a 200,000 - person Facebook group is easy has never tried to do it .
Indeed , Stephen Harper , Michael Ignatieff , Jack Layton and Gilles Duceppe , the four national party leaders , have less than 100,000 members combined on their respective Facebook pages .
In fact , much like Facebook , the political parties all make it as easy as possible to become members .
In the case of the Conservative or Liberal Parties , completing a form with just your name and address along with a $ 10 payment makes you a party member .
Not a particularly onerous burden , yet party membership numbers are regularly trumpeted as evidence of popular support .
Third , attempts to marginalize Facebook users as outside the mainstream is difficult to reconcile with the fact that Canadians are among the most active social network users in the world .
Recent estimates found 42 per cent of Canadians have a Facebook account , with more than 50 per cent under the age of 45 on the social network .
Fourth , the dismissal of social media as a useful tool for rallying support fails to recognize what marketers have long understood – word of mouth from a trusted source is always the most effective means of spreading a message .
Political parties invest millions in ad campaigns trying to garner public support , but Facebook advocacy is potentially more effective because it 's all about word of mouth .
Joining a group may require little more than a mouse click , but behind that click is a trusted network of friends and colleagues providing their personal recommendation .
Skeptics have pointed to rallies planned for this week as the litmus test for the effectiveness of the anti-proroguing Facebook group .
But with polls finding mounting interest in the issue , the battle has already been won , suggesting it 's long past time to cast aside doubts about the importance and effectiveness of digital advocacy .

This can't be legal , can it , impersonating a federal document that all Americans are mandated to fill out ?
The Republican Party is seeking input and money from GOP voters - seemingly under the guise of the U.S. Census Bureau .
" Strengthening our Party for the 2010 elections is going to take a massive grass - roots effort all across America .
That is why I have authorized a Census to be conducted of every Congressional District in the country , " GOP Chairman Michael Steele says in a letter mailed nationwide .
The letter was sent in plain white envelopes marked " Do Not Destroy , Official Document . "
Labeled " 2010 Congressional District Census , " the letter uses a capital " C , " the same as the Census Bureau .
It also includes a " Census Tracking Code . "
The letter makes a plea for money and accompanies a form asking voters to identify their political leanings and issues important to them .
There are no disclaimers that participation in the GOP effort is voluntary ; participation in the government census is required by law .
Failure to participate carries a $ 5,000 fine , though it is rarely enforced .
The GOP , of course , deny that their fundraiser was intended to mislead anyone .
But it 's laughable , at best , with their hugely partisan leading questions ( " Do you think the record trillion dollar federal deficit the Democrats are creating with their out - of - control spending is going to have disastrous consequences for our nation ? " ) and the mimicking of the Census form ( copy courtesy of the Politico ) , who are they trying to kid ?
Some Republican operative emailed Ben Smith at the Politico and unabashedly admitted it was intentionally misleading :
A knowledgeable Republican operative emails : " Of course duping people is the point ... that 's one of the reasons why it works so well .
The others : low per piece cost -- they drop hundreds of thousands of pieces at a time , and will likely mail millions this year .
And incredible targeting . "
All 's fair in love and politics , eh , GOP ?
The Census Bureau has officially not decided what steps to take , but the US Postal Service declined to investigate .

Toronto , ON dpkform Member Max over charges DOUBLING to $ 50 in March for all tiers !!!
Yup that 's right .
After 4 years away from Rogers , I have been back as a customer for less than two weeks .
After seeing some unclear information on their website , that made it look like only the lower tiers had the $ 25 cap , I called to confirm .
The first person I spoke to told me that no , it was $ 50 !
What , I exclaimed ?
Pass me on to cancellations .
The person in the cancellation department confirmed that current overage charges are max $ 25 per month , but that in March , that cap will be raised to $ 50 per month for all tiers !!!!
Bye Rogers ....
Or perhaps - this may be a good time to sign a contract , as I believe courts have held ( at least in the USA ) that a major change like this , DESPITE any legalese to the contrary , is a major breach of a contract .

Now that both Bell - land cablecos have bumped their overage cap to $ 50 / month , it should be only a matter of time before Bell bumps theirs too .
Both the telcos and cablecos want to shed their higher - usage subscribers or at the very least make them more profitable .
Since so many subscribers choose to hit the overage cap instead of moderating their usage , upgrading to more expensive plans or going somewhere else , they are compensating for their initial strategy 's misfire by making " cheap unlimited " more expensive .
Now that both Bell - land cablecos have bumped their overage cap to $ 50 / month , it should be only a matter of time before Bell bumps theirs too .

I can understand Rogers logic bumping the overage cap ... because so many people treat the $ 25 as a low enough amount to pay for the right to go " unlimited " .
Beyond a doubt , it 's another money grab , but at the same time , an additional $ 50 for unlimited is going to make a lot of people think twice .
The days of affordable unlimited are gone .
Bell is just around the corner with their attempts at UBB .
The CRTC told Bell ( and therefore all ISPs ) that they should manage congestion by these means in order of preference ...
1 ) increasing capacity
2 ) non-technical inducement to lower bandwidth ( i.e. like this with pricing excess usage out of the ballpark )
3 ) technical mechanisms for bandwidth reduction ( i.e. throttling )
Bell has plans that suggest two different overage tiers that will apply to both their own and wholesalers customers .
Rogers appears to be bumping the max charge .
In the interests of being competitive , you can be sure that Bell will follow suit .

no surprise , as soon as people abused it and just figured paying 25 $ overage all the time as a way of getting unlimited , you knew this would happen .

I would n't call it " abused " since Rogers did n't say that you were n't allowed to use the excess billing like that .
I 'd call it " took advantage of what Rogers offered " ...
I blame Rogers for continuing to not make clear their intentions .
If they WANT less usage then apply caps and reduce the connection speed to one that makes in not conducive to continuing to download gobs of data .
The fact that they do n't do things like that gives the impression that they only want the money ... so people took advantage of what Rogers offered .
Ca n't blame them .

Hi Everyone .
This is Mary with Rogers .
I appreciate everyone 's voicing their concerns and suggestions .
Let me try to add to this conversation by helping clarify the situation .
We always want to offer our customers great quality of service for the best value .
In the last year , we have made network and technology investments that include improvements in download speeds , expanding our network in other parts of Canada and launching Rogers On Demand Online free to all customers that subscribe to any Rogers product .
In terms of pricing , we have reduced higher tier services such as Extreme Plus ( $ 69.99 from $ 99.95 ) and Ultimate ( $ 99.99 from $ 149.99 ) .
Based on our research , the vast majority ( 90 % ) of Rogers Internet customers do not go over their usage limits each month and will not be impacted by changes to overage charges .
If you do , I would suggest calling Care to discuss which plan best suits your Internet use .
To help monitor usage , we have put various communication tools in place .
When you reach 75 % and 100 % of usage , you will get notification via your browser or email .
As well , you can keep track of usage throughout the month on our online portal .
I hope this helps address some of your comments above .
Thanks ,
Mary

It 's a bad thing when the people giving up their money do n't have enough of it to afford increases like this ... or upgrading packages ...
I can't go back to teksavvy ( dial up speeds for some reason ) , and I do n't know of any alternatives in cable that service my area .
So as a customer , with two people using the connection , it sucks in that I will now pay an extra $ 300 a year to maintain " unlimited " internet when it is n't even offered as a package .

That 's all well and good Mary but after several price increases which I say are in the level of once every 6 months or so and trying to offer more speed which frankly 90 % of customers also do n't need , I do n't think this price increase can be justified .
All I want and need is 10 megs and 200 GB cap and not for $ 99 / month .
You should be offering more flexible pricing similar to wireless data pricing .
So let 's say Express for $ 45 and 100 GB for $ 20 .
Even if I wanted to I can't get this " Ultimate " tier because the technology has not been deployed in Ottawa so again I say it 's more convenient for the customer to have the option to buy bandwidth blocks .
I also again do n't need 50 mbps or whatever it is because I do n't need more speed .
I am almost positive had you run a study of tiered pricing and asked whether the customer would prefer more speed or more bandwidth they would not always choose speed when you get into the higher tiers .
The other factor is , internet trends change constantly .
Who knows if a month from now average usage climbs up another 10 GB and you guys are n't always on top that .
I would also question whether the usage limits are necessary , you advertise limits but then place a max overage cap .
If they were really required then you would slow down the speed or charge more in usage blocks .
So again , your plans do n't work for me and many other people I have spoken with and they are not very flexible .

I know that you mean well there RogersMary , but you know this is a boilerplate response and I received astonishingly similar mails from Rogers about 7 years ago saying the same kind of things when there was a plan to implement 5 GB per month caps .
Strange how the protests by RBUA and others fell upon deaf ears but when Bell implemented their own caps , Rogers suddenly forgot about caps relishing the wave of high usage customers migrating from Bell Sympatico to Rogers !
These kinds of responses are frustrating because it shows that Rogers is not listening to their customers .
They are n't even listening to the concerns expressed here when they provide boiler plate answers which skirt over the issues .
OK , so the vast majority of users do n't go over the package usage caps .
The question is " what is Rogers going to do FOR users who find the plan limits insufficient ? "
Instead Rogers tells us how they 're going to PUNISH those who go over with ridiculously high per GB rates and then ameliorates that pain with a maximum overcharge limit , which it sounds like they 're about to increase .
You talk about speed increases and rate reductions .
What happened to the users in the Extreme tier .
They got negligible speed improvements to the point where Express and Extreme downstream are identical .
And the price of Extreme went up and up .
Personally I dropped off
Extreme because I needed to reduce my cable bill since I have to deal with high medication bills now for my wife and me and worse , you terminated the 15 % VIP discount and forced me into 10 % and locked me in for 2 years .
All these nice sounding words in the boiler plate letters just leave people angry that instead of doing things for their customers , Rogers PR are dreaming up soothing sounding words to pour oil on trouble waters .
Your post does n't cut the mustard , never mind the meat .

Of course all big corporations in Canada do n't think like that .
I read in one of the recent global ISP surveys that Canada is one of only 3 of the top 30 countries with caps ( even if they 're economic ) on internet usage .
How is it that the rest of the world seems to get along just fine without these restrictions ?
Until the government or the CRTC step in and open the infrastructure to real competition , we 'll continue to be taken advantage of .
And Mary , I do appreciate the input and courage to wade into this .
However , if Teksavvy can handle a few people downloading over a 1TB for $ 30 a month , I think Rogers can afford me getting more than 125GB for $ 90 .
Especially when you own all the infrastructure yourselves , it 's been there for decades , and bandwidth is so cheap almost it 's free for you .
The increase in overage charges is not directly about cost to Rogers for bandwidth .
It 's an attempt to push high usage customers into more expensive tiers .
Furthermore , coupled with throttling , it also controls customer behavior ( keep buying TV ) , while ensuring that usage levels are consistent and predictable .
Why do you think the 50 mbit package requires a TV subscription ?
Because they do n't want you getting it for free over the internet on your fancy new connection .
They do n't have to .
It 's getting to the point where there are no reasonable alternatives to Rogers .
Even Bell can't compete in my area when it comes to 25 mbit and 50 mbit connections .

That sounds odd , the capacity issue with the IKNS remotes does n't cause disconnections but in any case you are much better off fixing that then paying more for this crap .

Like humans , commonplace cultural objects can seem strange when viewed out of their familiar context – or in some cases appear all the more natural .

Sherry Turkle I . A new kind of object : From Rorschach to Relationship
I have studied the effects of computational objects on human developmental psychology for over twenty years , documenting the ways that computation and its metaphors have influenced our thinking about such matters as how the mind works , what it means to be intelligent , and what is special about being human .
Now , I believe that a new kind of computational object  the relational artifact  is provoking striking new changes in the narrative of human development , especially in the way people think about life , and about what kind of relationships it is appropriate to have with a machine .
Relational artifacts are computational objects designed to recognize and respond to the affective states of human beings and indeed , to present themselves as having " affective " states of their own .
They include children 's playthings ( such as Furbies and Tamagotchis ) , digital dolls that double as health monitoring systems for the homebound elderly ( Matsushita 's forthcoming Tama ) , sentient robots whose knowledge and personalities change through their interactions with humans , as well as software that responds to its users  emotional states and responds with " emotional states " of their own .
Over the past twenty years , I have often used the metaphor of " computer as Rorschach " to describe the relationship between people and their machines .
I found computers used as a projective screen for other concerns , a mirror of mind and self .
But todays relational artifacts make the Rorschach metaphor far less useful than before .
These artifacts do not so much invite projection as they demand engagement .
The computational object is no longer affectively " neutral . "
People are learning to interact with computers through conversation and gesture , people are learning that to relate successfully to a computer you do not have to know how it works , but to take it " at interface value , " that is to assess its emotional " state , " much as you would if you were relating to another person .
Through their experiences with virtual pets and digital dolls ( Tamagotchi , Furby , Amazing Ally ) , a generation of children are learning that some objects require ( and promise ) emotional nurturance .
Adults , too , are encountering technology that attempts to meet their desire for personalized advice , care and companionship ( help wizards , intelligent agents , AIBO , Matsushita 's forthcoming Tama ) .
These are only the earliest , crude examples of the relational technologies that will become part of our everyday lives in the next century .
There is every indication that the future of computational technology will include ubiquitous relational artifacts that have feelings , life cycles , moods , that reminisce , and have a sense of humor , which say they love us , and expect us to love them back .
What will it mean to a person when their primary daily companion comes is a robotic dog ?
Or their health care " worker " is a robot cat ?
Or their software program attends to their emotional states and , in turn , has its own ?.
We need to know how these new artifacts affect peoples way of thinking about themselves , human identity , and what makes people special .
These artifacts also raise significant new questions about how children apporach the question of  What is alive ? "
In the proposed research the question is not what the computer will be like in the future , but what will we be like , what kind of people are we becoming ?
Relational artifacts are changing the narrative of human development , including how we understand such " human " qualities as emotion , love , and care .
The dynamic between a person and an emotionally interactive , evolving , caring machine object is not the same as the relationship one might have with another person , or a pet , or a cherished inanimate object .
We have spent a large amount of social resources trying to build these artifacts ; now it is time to study what is happening to all of us as we go forth into a world " peopled " with a kind of object we have never experienced before .
We need to more deeply understand the nature and implications of this new sort of relationship  and its potential to fundamentally change our understanding of what it means to be human .
We need to be asking several kinds of new questions : 
How are we to conceptualize the nature of our attachments to interactive robots , affective computers , and digital pets ? 
How does interacting with relational artifacts affect peoples way of thinking about themselves and others , their sense of human identity and relationships ?
How do the models of development and values embedded in the design of relational artifacts both reflect and influence our ways of thinking about people ? 
What roles  both productive and problematic  can relational artifacts play in fulfilling a basic human need for relationship ?
Their first generation is being predominantly marketed to children and the elderly .
What does this reflect about our cultural values about these groups ?
How will these objects influence their understanding of who they are as individuals and in the world ?
Are we reinforcing their marginality ?
Are we tacitly acknowledging that we do not have enough " human " time to spend with them ?
II .
In the 1960s through the 1980s , researchers in artificial intelligence took part in what we might call the classical " great AI debates " where the central question was whether machines could be " really " intelligent .
This classical debate was essentialist ; the new relational objects tend to enable researchers and their public to sidestep such arguments about what is inherent in the computer .
Instead , the new objects depend on what people attribute to them ; they shift the focus to what the objects evoke in us .
When we are asked to care for an object ( the robot Kismet , the plaything Furby ) , when the cared - for object thrives and offers us its attention and concern , people are moved to experience that object as intelligent .
Beyond this , they feel a connection to it .
So the question here is not to enter a debate about whether relational objects " really " have emotions , but to reflect on a series of issues having to do with what relational artifacts evoke in the user .
In my preliminary research on children and Furbies , I have found that children describe these new toys as " sort of alive " because of the quality of their emotional attachments to the Furbies and because of their fantasies about the idea that the Furby might be emotionally attached to them .
So , for example , when I ask the question , " Do you think the Furby is alive ? " children answer not in terms of what the Furby can do , but how they feel about the Furby and how the Furby might feel about them .
Ron ( 6 ) : Well , the Furby is alive for a Furby .
And you know , something this smart should have arms .
It might want to pick up something or to hug me .
Katherine ( 5 ) : Is it alive ?
Well , I love it .
It s more alive than a Tamagotchi because it sleeps with me .
It likes to sleep with me .
Here , the computational object functions not only as an evocative model of mind , but as a kindred other .
With these new objects , children ( and adults ) not only reflect on how their own mental and physical processes are analogous to the machines , but perceive and relate to the machine as an autonomous and " almost alive " self .
My work with children and computational objects has evolved into a decades - long narrative about the way computation has affected the way we make sense of the world .
In many ways , the behaviors and comments of children have foreshadowed the reactions of adults .
In the first generation of computer culture I studied , the children of the late 1970s and early 1980s tended to resolve metaphysical conflicts about machine " aliveness " by developing a concept of " the psychological machine " concluding that psychology and a kind of consciousness were possible in objects they knew were not alive .
This way of coping with the conundrums posed by computational objects was pioneered by children , and later adopted by adults .
Later cohorts of children 's responses to computational objects that were more complex and problematic in new ways again reliably foreshadowed the conclusions the culture at large would soon reach .
First , they explained that although machines might be psychological in the cognitive sense ( they might be intelligent , they might have intentionality ) , they were not psychological in the emotional sense , because they did not know pain , or love , they were not mortal , and they did not have souls .
Soon after , the children I interviewed began consistently citing biology and embodiment as the crucial criteria that separated people from machines ; they insisted that qualities like breathing , having blood , being born , and , as one put it , " having real skin , " were the true signs of life .
Now , I have begun to see a new pattern  children describe relational artifacts not as " alive " or " not alive " , but as " sort - of - alive . "
Categories such as " aliveness " and " emotion " seem poised to split in the same way that the categories of " psychological " and " intelligent " did twenty years ago .
Children 's reactions to the presence of " smart machines " have fallen into discernable patterns over the past twenty years .
Adults ' reactions , too , have been changing over time , often closely following those of the children .
To a certain extent , we can look to children to see what we are starting to think ourselves .
However , in the case of relational artifacts , there is more to the choice of children as subjects than a simple desire to stay ahead of the curve in anticipating changes in computer culture .
By accepting a new category of relationship , with entities that they recognize as " sort - of - alive " , or " alive in a different , but legitimate way , " today 's children will redefine the scope and shape of the playing field for social relations in the future .
Because they are the first generation to grow up with this new paradigm , it is essential that we observe and document their experiences .

Meet the mini Monet : Seven - year - old boy sells paintings for £ 900 each
He paints six pictures a week and his last exhibition sold out in 14 minutes ...
Kieron Williamson kneels on the wooden bench in his small kitchen , takes a pastel from the box by his side and rubs it onto a piece of paper .
' Have you got a picture in your head of what you 're going to do ? ' asks his mother , Michelle .
' Yep , ' Kieron nods .
' A snow scene . '
I ask : because it is winter at the moment ?
' Yep . '
Do you know how you want it to come out ?
' Yep . '
And does it come out how you want it ?
' Sometimes it does . '
Artist at work : Kieron Williamson , aged seven , concentrating on a painting in the kitchen of the family home
Like many great artists , small boys are not often renowned for being talkative .
While Kieron Williamson is a very normal seven - year - old who uses his words sparingly , what slowly emerges on the small rectangle of paper in his kitchen is extraordinarily eloquent .
This month , Kieron 's second exhibition in a gallery in his home town of Holt , Norfolk , sold out in 14 minutes .
The sale of 16 new paintings swelled his bank account by £ 18,200 .
There are now 680 people on a waiting list for a Kieron original .
Art lovers have driven from London to buy his work .
Agents buzz around the town .
People offer to buy his school books .
The starting price for a simple pastel picture such as the one Kieron is sketching ?
£ 900 .
Kieron lives with his father , Keith , a former electrician , his mother , who is training to be a nutritionist , and his little sister , Billie - Jo , in a small flat overlooking a petrol station .
Picture perfect : A painting by Kieron , who took up painting at the age of five
Kieron prefers landscapes , but plans to paint a portrait of his grandmother for her 100th birthday
When I arrive , Kieron and Keith are out .
When Kieron returns in football socks and shorts , I assume he has been playing football .
But no , he has been replenishing his stock of pastels in Holt , a chichi little place where even the chip shop has grainy portraits for sale on its walls .
From Jan Lievens to Millais , there have been plenty of precocious geniuses in the art world .
Excitable press coverage has compared Kieron to Picasso , who painted his first canvas , The Picador , aged eight .
' We do n't know who Picasso is , really , ' says Keith .
' I know who Picasso is , ' interrupts Kieron .
' I do n't want to become him . '
Who would he like to become ?
' Monet or Edward Seago , ' he replies .
We are often suspicious of child prodigies .
We wonder if it is all their own work , or whether their pushy parents have hot - housed them .
People who do n't know the Williamsons might think Kieron is being cleverly marketed , particularly when they hear that Keith is now an art dealer .
The truth is far more innocent .
Two years ago , a serious accident forced Keith to stop work and turn his hobby of collecting art into an occupation .
The accident also stopped Keith racing around outside with his son .
Confined to a flat with no garden , surrounded by paintings and , like any small boy , influenced by his father , Kieron decided to take up drawing .
Figures at Holkham by Kieron :
There are now 680 people on a waiting list for an original by the youngster .
Art lovers have even driven from London to buy his work .
Kieron has had lessons with Norfolk - based painters , including Brian Ryder and his favourite , Tony Garner
Now , father and son are learning about art together .
Kieron is rubbing yellows and greys together for his sky .
' There 's some trees going straight across and then there 's a lake through the centre , ' he explains .
So , is this picture something you have seen , or is it in your imagination ?
' I saw it on the computer and every time I do the picture it changes , ' he says , handling his pastels expertly .
Keith ducks into the kitchen and explains that Kieron finds pictures he likes on the internet .
Rather than an exact copy , however , he creates his own version .
This winter scene is imagined from an image of the Norfolk Broads in summer .
At first , Kieron 's art was pretty much like any other five - year - old's .
But he quickly progressed and was soon asking questions that his parents could n't answer .
' Kieron wanted to know the technicalities of art and how to put a painting together , ' says Michelle .
Hearing of Kieron 's promise , a local artist , Carol Ann Pennington , offered him some tips .
Since then , he has had lessons with other Norfolk - based painters , including Brian Ryder and his favourite , Tony Garner .
Garner , a professional artist , has taught more than 1,000 adults over the past few decades and Kieron , he says , is head and shoulders above everyone .
' He does n't say very much , he does n't ask very much , he just looks .
He 's a very visual learner .
If I did a picture with most students , they 'd copy it - but Kieron will copy it , and then he will Kieronise it , ' he says .
' It might be a bit naive at the moment , but there 's a lovely freshness about what he does .
The confidence that this little chap has got - he just does n't see any danger . '
Kieron has been compared by some to Picasso , who painted his first canvas , The Picador , aged eight
Garner says Kieron 's parents have been brilliant at shielding their child from the business side and pressure this invariably brings .
Keith and Michelle are extremely proud , protective and , perhaps , slightly in awe of their son .
They insist that Kieron paints only when he wants to .
' We judge ourselves every day , wondering whether we are making the right choices , ' says Michelle .
' Kieron is such a strong character you would n't get him to do anything he did n't want to do anyway .
It 's a hobby .
Some could argue he's got such a talent , why are n't we doing more for him in terms of touring galleries every weekend .
We are a family and we 've got Billie - Jo to consider ; you 've got to strike a balance . '
With all the people wanting paintings , I ask Kieron if he feels he has to do them .
He says no .
So you only paint when you want to ?
' Yep . '
Do you have days when you feel you do n't want to paint ?
' Yep . '
How many paintings or drawings do you do each week ?
One or two ?
' About six . '
Is he a perfectionist ?
' You 've got a bit of an artist 's temperament , have n't you ? ' says Michelle , softly .
' You get frustrated if it does n't work out .
You punched a hole in the canvas once , did n't you ? '
But those incidents are rare .
Sometimes , however , Kieron will produce ' what we classify as a bag of trosh ' , says Michelle .
' He 's just got to go through the motions .
It 's almost as if it 's a release .
It 's the process that he enjoys , because there are days when he is not really focused on his work , but he just enjoys doing it . '
Sometimes , when they have taken Kieron out on painting trips in the countryside , the little boy has had other ideas : he has gone off and played in the mud or in a stream .
He is still allowed to act seven years old .
What do his school friends think ?
Are they impressed ? ' Yep . '
A moment later , Kieron pauses .
' I am also top of the class in maths , English , geography and science , ' he says , rubbing the sky in his picture .
Kieron explains he is sticking to landscapes for now , but plans to paint a portrait of his 98 - year - old grandmother when she turns 100 .
What does he think about people spending so much money on his paintings ?
' Really good . '
Would he like to be a professional painter ?
' Yep . '
He does n't want to be a footballer when he is older ?
' I want to be a footballer and a painter . '
Kieron enjoys playing football and , like his father , supports Leeds United .
What other things does Kieron like doing ?
' You played on the Xbox , but you got bored of it , did n't you ? ' says Keith .
' You said I could have it out at Christmas , ' says Kieron .
' You can have it out in the holidays , ' promises Michelle .
' He 's a bit all - or - nothing with whatever he does , like the artwork .
You have to pull the reins in a bit because otherwise he'd be up all night . '
What would his parents say if Kieron turned around and told them he was not going to paint any more ?
' Leave him to it .
As long as he 's happy .
At the end of the day , he 's at his happiest painting , ' says Keith .
Michelle adds : ' It 's entirely his choice .
We do n't know what 's around the corner .
Kieron might decide to put his boxes away and football might take over , and that would be entirely his choice .
' We 're feeling slightly under pressure because there is such a waiting list of people wanting Kieron 's work , but I 'm inclined to tell them to wait , really . '
I doubt many artists could paint or draw while answering questions and being photographed , but Kieron carries on .
When he finishes , we lean over to look .
' Not bad .
That 's nice , ' says Keith , who can't watch Kieron at work ; I wonder if it is because he is worried about his son making a mistake , but Keith says he just prefers to see the finished article .
' Is it as good as the one I did this morning , or better ? ' asks Kieron .
' What do you think ? ' replies Keith .
' It 's got a nice glow on it , has n't it ? '
Kieron nods .
I would love one of his pictures but , I tell Kieron , he is already too expensive for me .
' I can price one down for you , ' he says , as quick as a flash .
No , no , I could n't , I say , worried I would be exploiting a little boy .
I thank him for his time and hand him my business card .
And Kieron trots into his bedroom , comes out with his own business card and says thank you , right back .

The great divide between liberal Jewish Americans and the Israeli Right has lurked as an issue since the Likud Party first challenged Labor dominance in the late 1970s .
It is now coming to a boiling point , even as Israel ’s reputation in the world is sinking .
As rightwing policies more visibly fail , the Likudniks are flailing around making fools of themselves by smearing critics of those policies as racists .
( Anyone who knows how Likud supporters talk among themselves about Arabs and other outsiders can only be amused at their impudent hypocrisy in playing the race card . )
The mess that Mossad ’s mercenaries ( some of them possibly from the Fateh Palestinian faction also opposed to Hamas ) made of a routine political assassination in Dubai of a Hamas agent funneling arms from Iran is a blow against I the image of daring , stone - cold competence cultivated by the Israeli security establishment .
The killing went smoothly , but it transpires that the assassins had not only stolen the passport identities of British and Irish citizens , but those of several Israeli dual citizens originally from the UK , as well .
Mossad thus made potential problems for those passport holders for the rest of their lives , since Interpol will be interested every time the numbers pop up at an airport check - in .
The incident has roiled diplomatic relations with Ireland and the UK .
But it is also controversial in Israel ( not the assassination but the bumbling clumsy identity theft against Israeli citizens ) .
After all , branding an innocent Israeli an assassin is a sort of blood libel .
Indeed , casual political assassination as a routine Israeli method of statecraft makes many Jews uncomfortable , as is visible in Steven Spielberg ’s film , Munich .
But the harbingers of isolation are numerous .
The Netanyahu government has largely defied President Obama ’s requests for a halt to the colonization of the West Bank ( a freeze on building new settlements in part of the West Bank , while existing settlements are expanded and Palestinians are thrown in the street in Jerusalem does not count ) .
The Israeli siege of the children of Gaza , some of whom are looking skinnier , is impossible to justify and provoked even a US congressman to urge a forceful breaking of the blockade .
The Goldstone Report on Israeli war crimes ( and which also acknowledges Hamas war crimes ) for the United Nations is likely to attain an official status of a sort denied to previous such clear - eyed examinations of Israeli military action .
( Israel ’s leadership suffered not the least from dropping nearly a million cluster bombs on the civilian farms of southern Lebanon in the last 3 days of the 2006 Lebanon War , though this targeting of civilians was illegal and the US Congress had stipulated that the weapons could not be used that way ) .
The reactionary parties of Likud , Shas , and Yisrael Beitenu have nothing in common with the vast majority of Jewish Americans , who voted for Barack Obama and are generally more progressive than non-Jewish Americans .
The establishment of a liberal Jewish lobby , J Street , which supports a two - state solution ( Israel and Palestine side by side ) , is a manifestation of the increasing unease of progessive Jewish Americans with the policies and aggressive wars of rightwing Israeli governments .
Jewish Americans have been key to the securing of many of our civil liberties in this country and a major voice for peace and for culture and the arts , and a thug like Avigdor Lieberman as foreign minister surely makes many of them uneasy .
It is no accident that the Likud government has snubbed a delegation of US Congress members to Israel who support J Street .
The Netanyahu government is all about colonizing more of the West Bank and preventing the rise of a Palestinian state .
Then you have Holocaust survivor Hedy Epstein supporting the movement to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza civilians , including children .
The Israeli occupation and colonization of the West Bank provoked former president Jimmy Carter to warn of an Apartheid situation .
Although he was viciously attacked by the likes of Alan Dershowitz and subjected to the typical dirty tricks deployed by fanatical nationalists of all stripes , he has been vindicated by remarks of Israeli politician Ehud Barak , who just said the same thing Carter had .
The occupation is also provoking an increasing move to boycott Israel , especially firms and concerns based in the West Bank settlements or connected to the Lebanon and Gaza Wars .
The second largest union of Canadian federal employees has joined such a boycott .
During the Gaza War , Scandinavian grocery chains cancelled their orders for Israeli fruit , and the South African longshoremen declined to unload Israeli ships .
It is anxiety over the prospect that the current far - right Netanyahu government is becoming increasingly isolated from the world community , including the Obama administration in the US , and from a new generation of progressive Jewish Americans that explains the rash of scurrilous charges of ‘ anti- Semitism ’ being thrown around by the ‘ Israel - can - do - no - wrong ’ crowd in recent days .
You had Leon Wieseltier ’s unsubstantiated and shameful attack on Andrew Sullivan , which Sullivan effectively refuted — as did Glenn Greenwald , Matthew Ygglesias , and a number of others .
As Greenwald points out , the use of the ‘ anti- Semitism ’ charge against ordinary every day non -bigotted people who just do n’t agree with some policy of Israel or of the American Enterprise Institute risks making the term meaningless and cheapening it , which can hardly be good for the Jews .
Meanwhile , the main strategy of the Israeli and Jewish - American Right to preserve Israeli capacity to continue the colonization and to act belligerently in the region had been the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq .
That strategem has failed , as I argued in Salon .
The Shiite fundamentalists who have taken over Baghdad are pro-Hizbullah and pro-Palestinian .
( Hizbullah was in part set up by the Islamic Mission Party , Da’wa , of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , and Da’wa supported Hamas in the recent Gaza War ) .
Moreover , Baghdad has ceased helping contain Iran for the Sunni Arab world and the West , and is now a close ally of Tehran .
The prospect of a well - armed , 250,000 - man Iraqi army now being reconstituted , and riddled with agents of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps , must be a matter of consternation for Israelis .
Only Jordan separates them from Iraq , now an outpost of the Shiite religious parties allied with Khamenei .
The Neoconservatives , such as Richard Perle , David Frum , Paul Wolfowitz , Irv Lewis Libby , Michael Rubin , Douglas Feith , John Bolton , Larry Franklin and others thus not only shot themselves in the foot , but they shot Israel in the chest .
This Iraq strategy , which intended to stop the Rabin peace process and prevent the return of Gaza and the West Bank to the Palestinians for their state , was laid out by Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , and other Neoconservatives in a white paper for Bibi Netanyahu in 1996 .
Many of the authors were subsequently put in high office by Bush - Cheney and pushed for an American war on Iraq with dirty tricks and false propaganda in 2002 - 2003 .
They included Canadian gadfly journalist David Frum , who authored Bush ’s 2002 ‘ Axis of Evil ’ speech in consultation with Perle .
The mostly Jewish Neoconservatives were only one faction in the Bush - Cheney coalition that wanted regime change in Baghdad , which included the Christian Right , Big Oil , and the military - industrial complex .
However influential , they were not ‘ in control ’ and most Jewish Americans opposed their ideas and policies .
Frum , a Canadian who only became naturalized as a US citizen in 2007 , was important in the early years of the Bush presidency and crafted many of the falsehoods and propaganda points that got up the Iraq War .
He bears a heavy responsibility for the unnecessary deaths of over 4000 US military personnel , for the deaths of some 600,000 Iraqis , and for the displacement of nearly 4 million Iraqis .
In a just world , David Frum would be on trial for his role in severe violations of international law , as would Bush , Cheney , Perle , and the rest of those bald - faced liars and warmongers .
To cover his prevarications and failed policies , Frum joined Wieseltier in playing the anti-Semitism card at CNN this week , piling on Sullivan but also smearing yours truly .
His exhibit A was a passage in which I complained about supporters of the Israeli Likud party attempting to enlist the US military to fight wars on behalf of that party ’s platform .
The column was mainly about Larry Franklin , a Catholic , who went to jail on espionage charges for passing classified Pentagon documents to AIPAC and the Israeli embassy .
Since supporters of the Likud government , Christian and Jewish , are even now attempting to foment a US war on Iran on behalf of rightwing objectives in Israel ( Iran is no more a threat to the United States than Iraq had been ) , I rather stand by my condemnation of them .
As someone who travels to Israel , collaborates on research with Israeli colleagues , supports Israelis ’ right to live normal and fulfilling lives in security , and recently stayed in a kubbutz , I am puzzled by Frum ’s innuendo .
I am critical of Israeli policy in Gaza and the West Bank , but then so are former prime ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak ; I think I probably have n’t said anything on the issue that clear - eyed Israelis have n’t already said themselves .
But I will complain about David Frum ’s dual loyalties .
I am very suspicious of a rightwing Stephen Harper - style Canadian becoming so influential in the United States .
I like my Canadians in their normal , sane estate .
I fear he may be influencing my country in directions that benefit rightwing Canadian politicians and war industries in Ottawa .
Although Canada has also leant us treasures like William Shatner , Dan Akroyd and Paul Schaeffer , for which I ’m grateful , the latter never became ensconced in the halls of power or encouraged anyone to fire a shot in anger off the set .

Abstract
In the past year , in response to emerging independent science on the 9/11 attacks , nine corporate , seven public , and two independent media outlets aired analytic programs investigating the official account .
Increasingly , the issue is treated as a scientific controversy worthy of debate , rather than as a " conspiracy theory " ignoring science and common sense .
This essay presents these media analyses in the form of 18 case studies .
Eight countries – Britain , Canada , Denmark , France , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway and Russia – have allowed their publicly - owned broadcasting stations to air the full spectrum of evidence challenging the truth of the official account of 9/11 .
This more open approach taken in the international media – I could also have included the Japanese media – might be a sign that worldwide public and corporate media organizations are positioning themselves , and preparing their audiences , for a possible revelation of the truth of the claim that forces within the US government were complicit in the attacks – a revelation that would call into question the publicly given rationale for the military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan .
The evidence now being explored in the international media may pave the way for the US media to take an in - depth look at the implications of what is now known about 9/11 , and to re-examine the country 's foreign and domestic policies in the light of this knowledge .
I. Introduction
Until 2009 , doubts about the official 9/11 story were briefly entertained by the mainstream media on each anniversary of the event , allowing the independent research community only a fleeting moment once a year to publicly voice its findings .
But after crucial scientific evidence emerged in April 2009 to challenge the official story of how the towers fell , a spate of European media reports followed .
The news coverage of this evidence seems to have opened the door to more serious reflection on all aspects of the 9/11 issue in the major media .
The first paper in my series , " The Media Response to 9/11 , " dealt with the New Statesman 's grudging recognition of Dr. David Ray Griffin , the world 's " top truther " ( as it dubbed him ) , placing him number 41 among " The 50 People Who Matter Today . "
1
Since this admission in September 2009 , the issue has gathered increasing momentum .
The collective content issuing from this new momentum is presented here in the hope that it will embolden other major media to take up the pivotal controversy concerning 9/11 , and pursuing the truth wherever it may lead .
Observations on the Analysis
While carrying out my analysis , I observed five new features in the media treatment of the 9/11 issue that developed as 2009 progressed .
They are listed here , so that readers might look for them in the case studies that follow below :
1 . The 9/11 issue is increasingly framed not as conspiracy theories versus hard science , but as a legitimate controversy resting on unanswered questions and a search for truth .
2 . News reports and television programs examining these controversies have become longer and more balanced .
3 . Major media outlets have begun to present the claims of the truth movement first , followed by counter - arguments from defenders of the official story .
4 . Major media outlets have begun to include , and even to introduce , extensive evidence to support the claims of the 9/11 truth community .
5 . The media treatments increasingly suggest the possibility of a re-investigation into the events of September 11 , 2001 .
The first part of this essay deals with the crucial scientific evidence that emerged in early 2009 , the significance of this evidence in relation to the official story of 9/11 , and the immediate news coverage it received .
II . Scientific Paper Finds Nano - thermite Explosives in World Trade Center Dust , April 3 , 2009
A peer - reviewed paper published in the Open Chemical Physics Journal on April 3 , 2009, 2 reported that a little known high - tech explosive called nano - thermite was found throughout the World Trade Center dust .
These physicists and chemists involved in this study discovered " distinctive red / gray chips in significant numbers " 3 in four samples of dust collected from the area .
The presence of aluminum and iron oxide in the red material provided one of the signs that it might be nano - thermite , which is a high explosive ( whereas ordinary thermite is an incendiary . )
Another clue was provided when putting a flame to the chips produced an explosive reaction .
On the basis of these and other observations , the team concluded that " the red layer of the red / gray chips we have discovered in the WTC dust is active , unreacted thermitic material , incorporating nanotechnology , and is a highly energetic pyrotechnic or explosive material . "

The article 's first - named author , Dr. Niels Harrit – a University of Copenhagen chemistry professor who specializes in nano - chemistry5 –explained on Danish TV2 News :
" Thermite itself dates back to 1893 .
It is a mixture of aluminum and rust - powder , which react to create intense heat .
The reaction produces iron , heated to 2500 degrees Centigrade .
This can be used to do welding .
It can also be used to melt other iron .
" So in nano - thermite , this powder from 1893 is reduced to tiny particles , perfectly mixed .
When these react , the intense heat develops much more quickly .
Nano - thermite can be mixed with additives to give off intense heat , or serve as a very effective explosive .
It contains more energy than dynamite , and can be used as rocket fuel .
" You can not fudge this kind of science .
We have found it : unreacted thermite . "

Mr Fidler hoped to take advantage of a legal loophole A farmer who built a castle hidden behind a stack of straw bales has lost a High Court bid to save it from being demolished .
Robert Fidler , of Salfords , Surrey , built the home - complete with turrets - without planning permission .
He kept it hidden until August 2006 but was ordered to tear it down by Reigate and Banstead Borough Council in 2008 .
Mr Fidler appealed on the basis that his house had stood for four years without anyone objecting to it .
After the hearing , Mr Fidler pledged to take his fight to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary .
He said : " This house will never be knocked down .
This is a beautiful house that has been lovingly created .
I will do whatever it takes to keep it . "
Immunity rule
When Mr Fidler removed the bales he believed the structure would no longer be subject to planning enforcement because of a legal loophole .
But in March 2007 the borough council issued an enforcement notice , which was upheld by a Government planning inspector in May 2008 .
The inspector ruled that the removal of the straw bales constituted part of the building works and the four - year immunity rule would not apply .
The High Court was asked to decide whether the removal of the straw bales and tarpaulin was , in the eyes of the law , part of the building operation .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Deputy High Court judge Sir Thayne Forbes said : " In my view , the inspector 's findings of fact make it abundantly clear that the erection / removal of the straw bales was an integral - indeed an essential - fundamentally related part of the building operations that were intended to deceive the local planning authority and to achieve by deception lawful status for a dwelling built in breach of planning control . "
The judge said Mr Fidler had used two grain silos to form two turrets at the corners of his house .
There was also " a stain - glass lantern feature " over a central hall , or gallery .
The property includes a kitchen , living room , study , shower room and toilet and separate WC .
On the first floor , there are four bedrooms and another room still being fitted as a bathroom .
Appeal planned
On the south side of the house there is a gravelled forecourt , and to the north and north - western corner a new patio and conservatory .
The judge said : " Mr Fidler made it quite clear that the construction of his house was undertaken in a clandestine fashion , using a shield of straw bales around it and tarpaulins or plastic sheeting over the top in order to hide its presence during construction .
The castle has ramparts and a replica cannon " He stated that he knew he had to deceive the council of its existence until a period of four years from substantial completion and occupation had occurred as they would not grant planning permission for its construction .
" I accept that the act of concealment does not in itself provide a legitimate basis for the council to succeed , as hiding something does not take away lawful rights that may accrue due to the passage of time . "
He added : " From his own evidence and submissions it was always his intention to remove the bales once he thought that lawfulness had been secured . "
After the hearing Mr Fidler 's solicitor , Pritpal Singh Swarn , said an appeal was being considered .
He said : " Mr Fidler is obviously disappointed and will almost certainly want to appeal bearing in mind what he stands to lose , which is the house that he has built .
" The judge appears to have left open the big question - when is a building substantially complete ?
" It is necessary for the courts to draw the line as to what constitutes a completed development . "

Google has an app for that .
Using technologies written after Hurricane Katrina , Google has created a Web application that allows users to search and add to a vast missing persons database .
The code may also be embedded into Web sites .
“ One of the most personally gratifying things to come out of this effort is the fact that Google is using PeopleFinder Interchange Format ( PFIF ) to process the missing persons report , ” Andy Carvin at National Public Radio .
“ PFIF was created in the days and weeks following Hurricane Katrina , during which time many websites served as ad hoc collections of missing persons information , often published by family and friends in a narrative format .
While this format made for powerful , heartbreaking reading , it meant there was no easy way to organize all of this data into a single database .
So a group of volunteers created PFIF as a way of structuring this data , then mobilized literally thousands of other volunteers to convert these collections of missing persons information into PFIF . ”

The Bushes & the Truth About Iran By Robert Parry
September 21 , 2006 H aving gone through the diplomatic motions with Iran , George W. Bush is shifting toward a military option that carries severe risks for American soldiers in Iraq as well as for long - term U.S. interests around the world .
Yet , despite this looming crisis , the Bush Family continues to withhold key historical facts about U.S. - Iranian relations .
Those historical facts  relating to Republican contacts with Irans Islamic regime more than a quarter century ago  are relevant today because an underlying theme in Bushs rationale for war is that direct negotiations with Iran are pointless .
But Bushs own father may know otherwise .
The evidence is now persuasive that George H.W. Bush participated in negotiations with Irans radical regime in 1980 , behind President Jimmy Carters back , with the goal of arranging for 52 American hostages to be released after Bush and Ronald Reagan were sworn in as Vice President and President , respectively .
In exchange , the Republicans agreed to let Iran obtain U.S. - manufactured military supplies through Israel .
The Iranians kept their word , releasing the hostages immediately upon Reagans swearing - in on Jan. 20 , 1981 .
Over the next few years , the Republican - Israel - Iran weapons pipeline operated mostly in secret , only exploding into public view with the Iran - Contra scandal in late 1986 .
Even then , the Reagan - Bush team was able to limit congressional and other investigations , keeping the full history  and the 1980 chapter  hidden from the American people .
Upon taking office on Jan. 20 , 2001 , George W. Bush walled up the history even more by issuing an executive order blocking the scheduled declassification of records from the Reagan - Bush years .
After 9/11 , the younger George Bush added more bricks to the wall by giving Presidents , Vice Presidents and their heirs power over releasing documents .
Impending War
But that history is vital today .
First , the American people should know the real history of U.S. - Iran relations before the Bush administration launches another preemptive war in the Middle East .
Second , the degree to which Iranian officials are willing to negotiate with their U.S. counterparts  and fulfill their side of the bargain  bears on the feasibility of talks now .
Indeed , the only rationale for hiding the historical record is that it would embarrass the Bush Family and possibly complicate George W. Bushs decision to attack Iran regardless of what the American people might want .
The Time magazine cover story , released on Sept. 17 , and a new report by retired Air Force Col .
Sam Gardiner  entitled  The End of the  Summer Diplomacy  make clear that the military option against Iran is moving rapidly toward implementation .
Gardiner , who taught at the National War College and has war - gamed U.S. attacks on Iran for American policymakers over the past five years , noted that one of the seven key truths  guiding Bush to war is that  you cannot negotiate with these people .
That truth ,  combined with suspicions about Irans nuclear ambitions and Tehrans relationship with Hezbelloh and other militant Islamic groups , has led the Bush administration into the box - canyon logic that war is the only answer , despite the fact that Gardiners war games have found that war would have disastrous consequences .
In his report , Gardiner also noted that Bushs personality and his sense of his presidential destiny are adding to the pressures for war .
 The President is said to see himself as being like Winston Churchill , and to believe that the world will only appreciate him after he leaves office ; he talks about the Middle East in messianic terms ; he is said to have told those close to him that he has got to attack Iran because even if a Republican succeeds him in the White House , he will not have the same freedom of action that Bush enjoys .
 Most recently , someone high in the administration told a reporter that the President believes that he is the only one who can do the right thing with respect to Iran .
One thing is clear : a major source of the pressure for a military strike emanates from the very man who will ultimately make the decision over whether to authorize such a strike  the President . 
A Made - up Mind Washington
Post columnist Charles Krauthammer , who reflects the thinking of influential neoconservatives , reached a similar conclusion  that Bush had essentially made up his mind about attacking Iran .
Krauthammer noted that on the day after the fifth anniversary of 9/11 , Bush responded to a question about Iran by saying :  It s very important for the American people to see the President try to solve problems diplomatically before resorting to military force . 
 Before implies that one follows the other ,  Krauthammer wrote .
 The signal is unmistakable .
An aerial attack on Irans nuclear facilities lies just beyond the horizon of diplomacy .
With the crisis advancing and the moment of truth approaching , it is important to begin looking now with unflinching honesty at the military option . 
[ Washington Post , Sept. 15 , 2006 ]
Yet , before making such a fateful decision , shouldnt Bush at least ask his father to finally level with him and with the American people about what happened in 1980 when the country was transfixed by Iranian militants holding 52 American hostages for 444 days ?
At Consortiumnews.com , we have a special interest in that history because it was my discovery of a trove of classified documents pointing to the secret Republican negotiations with Iran that led to the founding of this Web site in 1995 and the publication of our first investigative series .
In the mid-1990s , the U.S. news media was obsessed with issues such as the O.J. Simpson trial and the so - called  Clinton scandals ,  so there was little interest in reexamining some historical mystery about Republicans going behind Jimmy Carters back to strike a deal with Irans mullahs .
[ The fullest account of this history can be found in Robert Parrys Secrecy & Privilege , which was published in 2004 . ]
But that history now could be a matter of life or death for thousands of people in the Middle East , including Iranians , Israelis and American soldiers in Iraq .
False History
The false history surrounding the Iranian hostage crisis also has led to the mistaken conclusion that it was only the specter of Ronald Reagans tough - guy image that made Iran buckle in January 1981 and that , therefore , the Iranians respect only force .
The hostage release on Reagans Inauguration Day bathed the new President in an aura of heroism as a leader so feared by Americas enemies that they scrambled to avoid angering him .
It was viewed as a case study of how U.S. toughness could restore the proper international order .
That night , as fireworks lit the skies of Washington , the celebration was not only for a new President and for the freed hostages , but for a new era in which American power would no longer be mocked .
That momentum continues to this day in George W. Bushs preemptive wars and the imperial boasts about a  New American Century . 
However , the reality of that day 25 years ago now appears to have been quite different than was understood at the time .
What s now known about the Iranian hostage crisis suggests that the coincidence of the Reagan Inauguration and the Hostage Release was not a case of frightened Iranians cowering before a U.S. President who might just nuke Tehran .
The evidence indicates that it was a prearranged deal between the Republicans and the Iranians .
The Republicans got the hostages and the political bounce ; Irans Islamic fundamentalists got a secret supply of weapons and various other payoffs .
State Secret
Though the full history remains a state secret , it now appears Republicans did contact Irans mullahs during the 1980 campaign ; a hostage agreement was reached ; and a clandestine flow of U.S. weapons soon followed .
In effect , while Americans thought they were witnessing one reality  the cinematic heroism of Ronald Reagan backing down Irans Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  another truth existed beneath the surface , one so troubling that the Reagan - Bush political apparatus has made keeping the secret a top priority for a quarter century .
The American people must never be allowed to think that the Reagan - Bush era began with collusion between Republican operatives and Islamic terrorists , an act that many might view as treason .
A part of those secret dealings between Iran and the Republicans surfaced in the Iran - Contra Affair in 1986 , when the public learned that the Reagan - Bush administration had sold arms to Iran for its help in freeing U.S. hostages then held in Lebanon .
After first denying these facts , the White House acknowledged the existence of the arms deals in 1985 and 1986 but managed to block investigators from looking back before 1984 , when the official histories assert that the Iran initiative began .
During the 1987 congressional hearings on Iran - Contra , Republicans  behind the hardnosed leadership of Rep. Dick Cheney  fought to protect the White House , while Democrats , led by the accommodating Rep. Lee Hamilton , had no stomach for a constitutional crisis .
The result was a truncated investigation that laid much of the blame on supposedly rogue operatives , such as Marine Lt. Col.
Oliver North .
Many American editors quickly grew bored with the complex Iran - Contra tale , but a few reporters kept searching for its origins .
The trail kept receding in time , back to the Republican - Iranian relationship forged in the heat of the 1980 presidential campaign .
 Germs of Scandal Besides the few journalists , some U.S. government officials reached the same conclusion .
For instance , Nicholas Veliotes , Reagans assistant secretary of state for the Middle East , traced the germs of the Iran - Contra scandal to the 1980 campaign .
In a PBS interview , Veliotes said he first discovered the secret arms pipeline to Iran when an Israeli weapons flight was shot down over the Soviet Union on July 18 , 1981 , after straying off course on its third mission to deliver U.S. military supplies from Israel to Iran via Larnaca , Cyprus .
 We received a press report from Tass [ the official Soviet news agency ] that an Argentinian plane had crashed ,  Veliotes said .
 According to the documents this was chartered by Israel and it was carrying American military equipment to Iran .
And it was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American - origin military equipment .
 Now this was not a covert operation in the classic sense , for which probably you could get a legal justification for it .
As it stood , I believe it was the initiative of a few people [ who ] gave the Israelis the go - ahead .
The net result was a violation of American law . 
The reason that the Israeli flights violated U.S. law was that no formal notification had been given to Congress about the transshipment of U.S. military equipment as required by the Arms Export Control Act  a foreshadowing of George W. Bushs decision two decades later to bypass the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
In checking out the Israeli flight , Veliotes came to believe that the Reagan - Bush camps dealings with Iran dated back to before the 1980 election .
 It seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980 , as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration ,  Veliotes said .
 And I understand some contacts were made at that time .
Q :  Between ? 
Veliotes :  Between Israelis and these new players . 
Israeli Interests
In my work on the Iran - Contra scandal , I had obtained a classified summary of testimony by a mid-level State Department official , David Satterfield , who saw the early arms shipments as a continuation of Israeli policy toward Iran .
 Satterfield believed that Israel maintained a persistent military relationship with Iran , based on the Israeli assumption that Iran was a non-Arab state which always constituted a potential ally in the Middle East ,  the summary read .
 There was evidence that Israel resumed providing arms to Iran in 1980 . 
Over the years , senior Israeli officials claimed that those early shipments had the discreet blessing of top Reagan - Bush officials .
In May 1982 , Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon told the Washington Post that U.S. officials had approved the Iranian arms transfers .
 We said that notwithstanding the tyranny of Khomeini , which we all hate , we have to leave a small window open to this country , a tiny small bridge to this country ,  Sharon said .
A decade later , in 1993 , I took part in an interview with former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in Tel Aviv during which he said he had read Gary Sicks 1991 book , October Surprise , which made the case for believing that the Republicans had intervened in the 1980 hostage negotiations to disrupt Jimmy Carters reelection .
With the topic raised , one interviewer asked ,  What do you think ?
Was there an October Surprise ? 
 Of course , it was ,  Shamir responded without hesitation .
 It was . 
Later in the interview when pressed for details , Shamir seemed to regret his candor and tried to backpedal somewhat on his answer .
Lie Detector Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh also came to suspect that the arms - for - hostage trail led back to 1980 , since it was the only way to make sense of why the Reagan - Bush team continued selling arms to Iran in 1985 - 86 when there was so little progress in reducing the number of American hostages in Lebanon .
When Walshs investigators conducted a polygraph of George H.W. Bushs national security adviser Donald Gregg , they added a question about Greggs possible participation in the secret 1980 negotiations .
 Were you ever involved in a plan to delay the release of the hostages in Iran until after the 1980 Presidential election ?  the examiner asked .
Greggs denial was judged to be deceptive .
[ See Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran / Contra Matters , Vol. I , p. 501 ]
While investigating the so - called  October Surprise  issue for PBS  Frontline in 1991 - 92 , I also discovered a former State Department official who claimed contemporaneous knowledge of an October 1980 trip by then vice presidential candidate George H.W. Bush to Paris to meet with Iranians about the hostages .
David Henderson , who was then a State Department Foreign Service officer , recalled the date as October 18 , 1980 .
He said he heard about the Paris trip when Chicago Tribune correspondent John Maclean met him for an interview on another topic .
Maclean , son of author Norman Maclean who wrote A River Runs Through It , had just been told by a well - placed Republican source that Bush was flying to Paris for a clandestine meeting with a delegation of Iranians about the American hostages .
Henderson wasnt sure whether Maclean was looking for some confirmation or whether he was simply sharing an interesting tidbit of news .
For his part , Maclean never wrote about the leak because , he told me later , a GOP campaign spokesman had denied it .
Faded Memory
As the years passed , the memory of that Bush - to - Paris leak faded for both Henderson and Maclean , until October Surprise allegations bubbled to the surface in the early 1990s .
Several intelligence operatives were claiming that Bush had undertaken a secret mission to Paris in mid-October 1980 to give the Iranian government an assurance from one of the two Republicans on the presidential ticket that the GOP promises of future military and other assistance would be kept .
Henderson mentioned his recollection of the Bush - to - Paris leak in a 1991 letter to a U.S. senator , which someone sent to me .
Though Henderson didnt remember the name of the Chicago Tribune reporter , we were able to track it back to Maclean through a story that he had written about Henderson .
Though not eager to become part of the October Surprise story in 1991 , Maclean confirmed that he had received the Republican leak .
He also agreed with Hendersons recollection that their conversation occurred on or about Oct.18 , 1980 .
But Maclean still declined to identify his source .
The significance of the Maclean - Henderson conversation was that it was a piece of information locked in a kind of historical amber , untainted by subsequent claims from intelligence operatives whose credibility had been challenged .
One couldnt accuse Maclean of concocting the Bush - to - Paris allegation for some ulterior motive , since he hadnt used it in 1980 , nor had he volunteered it a decade later .
He only confirmed it when asked and even then wasnt eager to talk about it .
Bush Meeting
The Maclean - Henderson conversation provided important corroboration for the claims by the intelligence operatives , including Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe who said he saw Bush attend a final round of meetings with Iranians in Paris .
Ben -Menashe said he was in Paris as part of a six - member Israeli delegation that was coordinating the arms deliveries to Iran .
He said the key meeting had occurred at the Ritz Hotel in Paris .
In his memoirs , Profits of War , Ben-Menashe said he recognized several Americans , including Republican congressional aide Robert McFarlane and CIA officers Robert Gates , Donald Gregg and George Cave .
Then , Ben-Menashe said , Iranian cleric Mehdi Karrubi arrived and walked into a conference room .
 A few minutes later George Bush , with the wispy - haired William Casey in front of him , stepped out of the elevator .
He smiled , said hello to everyone , and , like Karrubi , hurried into the conference room ,  Ben-Menashe wrote .
Ben-Menashe said the Paris meetings served to finalize a previously outlined agreement calling for release of the 52 hostages in exchange for $ 52 million , guarantees of arms sales for Iran , and unfreezing of Iranian monies in U.S. banks .
The timing , however , was changed , he said , to coincide with Reagans expected Inauguration on Jan. 20 , 1981 .
Ben-Menashe , who repeated his allegations under oath in a congressional deposition , received support from several sources , including pilot Heinrich Rupp , who said he flew Casey  then Reagans campaign director  from Washingtons National Airport to Paris on a flight that left very late on a rainy night in mid-October .
Rupp said that after arriving at LeBourget airport outside Paris , he saw a man resembling Bush on the tarmac .
The night of Oct. 18 indeed was rainy in the Washington area .
Also , sign - in sheets at the Reagan - Bush headquarters in Arlington , Virginia , placed Casey within a five - minute drive of National Airport late that evening .
Other Witnesses
There were other bits and pieces of corroboration about the Paris meetings .
As early as 1987 , Irans ex-President Bani-Sadr had made similar claims about a Paris meeting between Republicans and Iranians .
A French arms dealer , Nicholas Ignatiew , told me in 1990 that he had checked with his government contacts and was told that Republicans did meet with Iranians in Paris in mid-October 1980 .
A well - connected French investigative reporter Claude Angeli said his sources inside the French secret service confirmed that the service provided cover for a meeting between Republicans and Iranians in France on the weekend of Oct. 18 - 19 , 1980 .
German journalist Martin Kilian had received a similar account from a top aide to the fiercely anti-communist chief of French intelligence , Alexandre deMarenches .
Later , deMarenchess biographer , David Andelman , told congressional investigators under oath that deMarenches admitted that he had helped the Reagan - Bush campaign arrange meetings with Iranians about the hostage issue in the summer and fall of 1980 , with one meeting held in Paris in October .
Andelman said deMarenches ordered that the secret meetings be kept out of his biography because the story could otherwise damage the reputation of his friends , Casey and Bush .
 I dont want to hurt my friend , George Bush ,  Andelman recalled deMarenches saying as Bush was seeking re-election in 1992 .
Gates , McFarlane , Gregg and Cave all denied participating in the meeting , though some alibis proved shaky and others were never examined at all .
Lashing Out For his part , George H.W. Bush lashed out at the October Surprise allegations .
At a news conference on June 4 , 1992 , Bush was asked if he thought an independent counsel was needed to investigate allegations of secret arms shipments to Iraq during the 1980s .
 I wonder whether they re going to use the same prosecutors that are trying out there to see whether I was in Paris in 1980 ,  Bush snapped .
As a surprised hush fell over the press corps , Bush continued ,  I mean , where are we going with the taxpayers  money in this political year ? 
Bush then asserted ,  I was not in Paris , and we did nothing illegal or wrong here on Iraq .
Though Bush was a former CIA director and had been caught lying about Iran - Contra with his claims of being out of the loop ,  he was still given the benefit of the doubt in 1992 .
Plus , he had what appeared to be a solid alibi for Oct. 18 - 19 , 1980 , Secret Service records which placed him at his home in Washington on that weekend .
However , the Bush administration released the records only in redacted form , making it difficult for congressional investigators to verify exactly what Bush had done that day and whom he had met .
The records for the key day of Sunday , Oct. 19 , purported to show Bush going to the Chevy Chase Country Club in the morning and to someones private residence in the afternoon .
If Bush indeed had been on those side trips , it would close the window on any possible flight to Paris and back .
Investigators of the October Surprise mystery  including those of us at  Frontline  put great weight on the Secret Service records .
But little is really known about the Secret Services standards for recording the movements of protectees .
Since the cooperation of the protectees is essential to the Secret Service staying in position to thwart any attacker , the agents presumably must show flexibility in what details they report .
Few politicians are going to want bodyguards around if they write down the details of sensitive meetings or assignations with illicit lovers .
Reasonably , the agents might have to fudge or leave out some of the facts .
Bushs Alibi
As it turned out , only one Secret Service agent on the Bush detail  supervisor Leonard Tanis  claimed a clear recollection of the trip to the Chevy Chase Country Club that Sunday .
Tanis told congressional investigators that Mr. and Mrs. Bush went to the Chevy Chase club for brunch with Justice and Mrs. Potter Stewart .
But at  Frontline ,  we had already gone down that path and found it to be a dead end .
We had obtained Mrs. Bushs protective records and they showed her going to the C&O Canal jogging path in Washington , not to the Chevy Chase club .
We also had reached Justice Stewarts widow , who had no recollection of any Chevy Chase brunch .
So it appeared that Tanis was wrong  and he later backed off his claims .
The inaccurate Tanis account raised the suspicions of House International Affairs Committee counsel Spencer Oliver .
In a six - page memo urging a closer look at the Bush question , Oliver argued that the Secret Service had withheld the uncensored daily report for no justifiable reason from Congress .
 Why did the Secret Service refuse to cooperate on a matter which could have conclusively cleared George Bush of these serious allegations ?
Oliver asked .
 Was the White House involved in this refusal ?
Did they order it ?
Oliver also noted Bushs strange behavior in raising the October Surprise issue on his own at two news conferences .
 It can be fairly said that President Bush 's recent outbursts about the October Surprise inquiries and [ about ] his whereabouts in mid-October of 1980 are disingenuous at best ,  wrote Oliver , since the administration has refused to make available the documents and the witnesses that could finally and conclusively clear Mr. Bush . 
Secret Flight
Unintentionally , Bushs eldest son poked another hole in the assumption that the government would never doctor official records to help cover up international travel by a protected public figure .
For Thanksgiving 2003 , George W. Bush wanted to make a surprise flight to Iraq .
To give Bushs flight additional security  and extra drama  phony flight plans were filed , a false call sign was employed , and Air Force One was identified as a  Gulfstream 5  in response to a question from a British Airways pilot .
 A senior administration official told reporters that even some members of Bushs Secret Service detail believed he was still in Crawford , Texas , getting ready to have his parents over for Thanksgiving ,  Washington Post reporter Mike Allen wrote .
[ Washington Post , Nov. 28 , 2003 ]
Besides falsely telling reporters that George W. Bush planned to spend Thanksgiving at his Texas ranch , Bushs handlers spirited Bush to Air Force
One in an unmarked vehicle , with only a tiny Secret Service contingent , the Post reported .
Bush later relished describing the scene to reporters .
 They pulled up in a plain - looking vehicle with tinted windows .
I slipped on a baseball cap , pulled er down -- as did Condi .
We looked like a normal couple ,  he said , referring to national security adviser Condoleezza Rice .
Though the melodramatic deception surrounding Bushs flight to Baghdad soon became public  since it was in essence a publicity stunt  it did prove the ability of high - ranking officials to conduct their movements in secrecy and the readiness of security personnel to file false reports as part of these operations .
Collapsing Alibis
By the late 1990s , other elements of the Republicans  October Surprise alibis were collapsing , including pro-Reagan - Bush claims cited prominently by some news organizations , such as the New Republic and Newsweek .

 The Bushes & the Death of Reason . ]
With the Republican defenses falling apart and with many documents from the Reagan - Bush years scheduled for release in 2001 , the opportunity to finally learn the truth about the pivotal election of 1980 loomed .
But George W. Bush got into the White House via a ruling by five Republicans on the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the counting of votes in Florida .
Then , on his first day in office , his counsel Alberto Gonzales drafted an executive order for Bush that postponed release of the Reagan - Bush records .
After the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , Bush approved another secrecy order that put the records beyond the publics reach indefinitely , passing down control of many documents to a Presidents or a Vice Presidents descendants .
Thus , the truth about how the Reagan - Bush era began in the 1980s  and what was done to contain the Iran - Contra investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s  might eventually become the property of the noted scholars , the Bush twins , Jenna and Barbara .
The American people will be kept in the dark about their own history , like the subjects of some hereditary dynasty .
Without the facts , they also face the possibility of being more easily manipulated by emotional appeals devoid of informed debate
That moment has come sooner than many expected .
The United States appears to be on the brink of a war with Iran , while many government officials and the citizenry are operating on historical assumptions derived more from fiction than fact .

Implementing domain - specific languages using dependent types and partial evaluation Edwin Brady School of Computer Science
University of St Andrews Thursday , 7 January 2010 , 14:00
Cybernetica Bldg ( Akadeemia tee 21 ) , room B101
Slides from the talk [ pdf ]
Abstract :
In this talk , I will describe the efficient implementation of domain - specific languages ( DSLs ) in Idris , a dependently typed functional programming language .
I will show that partial evaluation can be an effective and , unusually , straightforward technique for the efficient implementation of DSLs .
We achieve this by exploiting dependent types and by following some simple rules in the definition of the DSL interpreter .
I will present experimental evidence that partial evaluation of programs in domain - specific languages yields efficient residual programs whose performance is competitive with their Java and C equivalents and which are also , through the use of dependent types , verifiably resource - safe .
Using this technique , it follows that a verifiably correct and resource - safe program can also be an efficient program .

Rep. Mary Lou Dickerson , a Seattle Democrat who is sponsoring the legalization bill in Washington state , said that she " wanted to start a strong conversation about the pros and cons of legalizing marijuana . "
Under her bill , marijuana would be sold in Washington state 's 160 state - run liquor stores , and customers , 21 and older , would pay a tax of 15 percent per gram .
The measure would dedicate most of the money raised for substance abuse prevention and treatment , which is facing potential cuts in the state budget .
Dickerson said the measure could eventually bring in as much to state coffers as alcohol does , more than $ 300 million a year .

When you 're in front of your PC , waiting for something to trans fer to removable media , that 's when seconds feel like minutes , and minutes feel like hours .
And data storage scenarios such as that one is where the new SuperSpeed USB 3.0's greatest impact will be felt first .
As of CES , 17 SuperSpeed USB 3.0 - certified products were introduced , including host controllers , adapter cards , motherboards , and hard drives ( but no other consumer electronics devices ) .
Still more uncertified USB 3.0 products are on the way , and they can't get here fast enough .
Glance Backward
The beauty of USB 3.0 is its backward compatibility with USB 2.0 ; you need a new cable and new host adapter ( or , one of the Asus or Gigabyte motherboards that supports USB 3.0 ) to achieve USB 3.0 , but you can still use the device on a USB 2.0 port and achieve typical USB 2.0 performance .
In reducing some overhead requirements of USB ( now , the interface only transmits data to the link and device that need it , so devices can go into low power state when not needed ) , the new incarnation now uses one - third the power of USB 2.0 .
The theoretical throughput improvement offered by USB 3.0 is dramatic -- a theoretical 10X jump over existing USB 2.0 hardware .
USB 2.0 maxed out at a theoretical 480 Mbps , while USB 3.0 can theoretically handle up to 5 Gbps .
Mind you , applications like storage will still be limited by the type of drive inside ; so , for example , you can expect better performance from RAIDed hard drives or fast solid - state drives ( SSDs ) than from , say , a standalone single drive connected to the computer via USB 3.0 .
The real - world examples are fairly convincing -- and underscore USB 3.0's advantage for high - def video , music , and digital imaging applications .
Our early test results are encouraging as well :
We tested Western Digital 's My Book 3.0 , the first USB 3.0 - certified external hard drive .
The performance was on a par with that of eSATA - but the benefit here is that USB 3.0 is a powered port , so you do n't need to have another external power supply running to the drive ( as you do with eSATA ; unless the eSATA drive you 're using is designed to steal power from a USB port while transferring data over the eSATA interface ) .
New Entries
While the WD drive was the first to announce , a slew of other hard drive makers either announced products at the show , or discussed plans to release products in the coming months .
Among them : Seagate ( which is doing a portable drive ) , LaCie , Rocstor , and Iomega .
Even non-traditional hard drive vendors like Dane - Elec and A - Data showed products they billed as USB 3.0 ( the latter two even had USB 3.0 - connected SSDs , the first external drives to use solid - state storage inside .
One of the things to look for in the coming months is the certified SuperSpeed USB 3.0 logo .
Products are currently filling the queues at the official certification testing labs , but presence of that certification logo will give you some peace of mind that the product you 're buying truly does live up to the USB 3.0 spec .
Given that the certification labs are jammed up , though , you can expect companies to release USB 3.0 products without official certification .
( Buffalo Technologies ' drive , released late 2009 , is not certified ; LaCie 's drives are in the process of certification , but will initially carry LaCie 's own logo for USB 3.0 , and will gain a sticker on the box once certification is completed . )
And in those cases , it will be hard to know whether the device truly lives up to its performance potential .
Compatibility Guarantee
And this time around , the way the USB spec is written , says Jeff Ravencraft , consumers should have an easier time finding products that are truly USB 3.0 .
Before , in the transition from USB 1.1 to USB 2.0 , the USB 2.0 spec was written in a way where it " encompassed low , full and high - speed USB , " explains Ravencraft , president and chairman of the USB Implementers Forum .
" Since those are all encapsulated in the USB 2.0 spec , [ vendors ] could have a certified product that 's low - speed , but still call it USB 2.0 .
" We do n't have that issue with USB 3.0 To claim you 're USB 3.0 , you have to deliver 5 Gbps .
There 's no other way to get the certification . "
Ravencraft adds that the group is prepared to protect the USB 3.0 logo , to make sure that only manufacturers who go through certification use it .
" We 'll take legal action if anyone infringes on our marks . "
By end of year , Ravencraft says the loggerjam of products awaiting certification should be past , and the organization 's network of worldwide test labs will be handling USB 3.0 certification .
According to In - Stat Research , by 2013 , more than one - quarter of USB 3.0 products will support SuperSpeed USB 3.0 .
Ravencraft says this is the fastest ramp up of USB products he 's seen in the past ten years , across the previous versions of USB .
I say the change can't come fast enough .
The trick , though , will be getting the interface into our notebooks ( without requiring a kludgy ExpressCard adapter ) .
So far , though , only HP and Fujitsu have announced limited USB 3.0 support on notebooks .
And Taiwanese notebook and desktop maker MSI indicated that it would n't have USB 3.0 until , at the earliest , the third - quarter of this year ; product managers for both notebooks and desktops cited manufacturing concerns like chipset availability in large quantities , and the need to test USB 3.0 chipsets .
And in the meantime , the only announced peripherals remain storage devices .
At next year 's CES , it 's likely we 'll hear more about specific consumer electronics devices such as digital cameras and camcorders and video cameras moving to USB 3.0 .
Hopefully by then we 'll start getting a critical mass of PC hardware with USB 3.0 integrated , too .

A GOOD selection of Belgian - style ales is like the very best kind of buffet , offering an assortment of flavors , aromas , styles , strengths and types .
You want strong ale , sour ale , sweet ale , dry ale , golden , dark , wheat , fruity and malty .
When we set out to draw a stylistic standard for a planned tasting of Belgian golden ales , it seemed as if we ’d taken on an impossible task .
But glory does not come to those who quit easily .
So we forged ahead .
We gathered Belgian golden ales and their foreign relatives as if they were snowflakes , aware that each was so unusual , and often so beautiful in a singular way , that it would resist any but the roughest categorization .
The blind tasting of these 20 Belgian - style ales was truly glorious , beer at its highest level .
For the tasting Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Christian Pappanicholas , the owner of Resto , a Belgian restaurant in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan , and Richard Scholz , an owner of Bierkraft in Park Slope , Brooklyn .
Our efforts to categorize the beers withered in the face of diversity .
Ostensibly , we sought strong golden ales , which at least suggests beers with a lot of alcohol and of a certain color , right ?
Well , not exactly .
Of the 20 we ended up with , most were golden , but some tended toward amber and brown .
And while some of the beers were strong , with alcohol levels of 9 to 13 percent , a handful were in the 6 percent range , about the strength of a typical pilsner .

This is exactly what I feel when I could n't breathe in my sleep yesterday night .
It was like a nightmare and I was praying to God to be still alive when I woke up .
A black nightmare diving into my dream and ready to get my life .
First of all , you must know , almost % 90 of the society suffers from sleep apnea but most of them are n't aware of the fact that they have .
Stopping of breath continues all the night without any indication .
However , conscious patients know their symptoms since they care their overall health .
In fact , it is relatively easy to determine whether someone is suffered or not .
The symptoms are clear to be defined .
Here is the some specifics of sleep apnea .
If you have or feel one of these symptoms , you should be more attentive on your health .
1. Snoring
This is the most determinant factor which is easy to be observed .
Most of the time , snoring people are not aware of this but their friends , parents , bed partners or neighbors are not .
Snoring disrupts the quality of sleep .
2. Silences during sleep
The frequency of silences is important .
Frequent silences during sleep can change the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood .
The sudden changes and imbalances affect the quality of sleep and life as well .
3. Sleepiness
Patients have daytime sleepiness .
This changes the biological clock of a person .
4. Headache
Poor quality sleep causes to high or low tension and daytime headaches .
5.Dry throat in the morning and night urination problems .
Patients mostly wake up with a dry throat and sour taste in the mouth in the mornings and most of the patients wake up frequently to pee during the night .
6. Mental and psychological problems
Continuos headache and blood pressure problem cause to mental problems such as memory loss , decreasing sex interest and sudden mood changes .
7. Tiredness
People always feel tired in daytime .
They feel exhausted .
8. Perspiration during sleep
People feel wet and perspired when they wake up as if they run all the night .
Patients have to be treated as much as possible because sleep apnea may cause many other severe problems like imbalanced heart beating and risk of heart attack , increase in the size of heart , blood pressure problems , extreme tiredness , decrease in focusing , depression , metabolism problems , obesity and death of course .
Sleep disorders can be recovered if what brings about it is properly specified .
The solution is actually the problem itself .
NBC pulled Conan O'Brien 's devious Bugatti Veyron Mouse sketch from last night 's " full episode " replay of the Tonight Show on NBC.com and Hulu — apparently unwilling to pay royalties for Conan 's " crazy expensive " car - starring sketch .

As if renting ( there 's no way he actually paid to buy it ) and rolling out a mouse - costumed $ 1.5 million Bugatti Veyron was n't already an extravagance , playing the original Rolling Stones recording of " Satisfaction " on top of it certainly costs a pretty penny for each time it airs .
Howver , do n't expect that to happen .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia has registered the first population increase since the chaotic years which followed the fall of the Soviet Union , bucking a long - term decline that has dampened economic growth projections , officials said on Tuesday .
Russia ’s population increased by between 15,000 and 25,000 to more than 141.9 million in 2009 , the first annual increase since 1995 , Health Minister Tatyana Golikova told a meeting in the Kremlin with President Dmitry Medvedev .
The rise was helped by a 4 percent decline in mortality rates and an influx of immigrants , mostly from the former republics of the former Soviet Union , Golikova said .
“ The difference between birth rates and mortality rates will be covered by a rise in migration , ” Golikova said in a televised Kremlin meeting , adding that Russia was trying to cut the number of abortions .
“ Our abortion rates are comparable to birth rates , ” she said .
Russia registered 1.7 million births in 2009 and 1.2 million abortions .
DIRE FORECASTS
Russia ’s dire population forecasts -- some of which predict sharp declines over the next few decades -- are a key function of economic predictions which see Russia growing much slower over the next 20 years than the other BRIC countries ; China , Brazil and India .
U.S. bank Goldman
Sachs has said that a change in population forecasts could significantly change the long - term growth projections for Russia , whose economy contracted by at least 8.5 percent in 2009 , its biggest annual decline in 15 years .
Goldman says Russia could grow by 1.5 - 4.4 percent a year from 2011 - 2050 , way behind the 3.6 - 7.9 percent annual growth projection for China or the 5.8 - 6.6 percent annual growth projection for India .
“ Russia is perhaps the least predictable and possibly the one with the scope to surprise the most , ” Goldman economist Jim O’Neill wrote in a report last month , adding that Russia ’s economy could overtake Germany ’s in 2029 and Japan ’s in 2037 .
Russia ’s population rose slightly in the first four years after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union , reaching 148.5 million in 1995 , though it declined every year between 1995 and 2009 .
Russia is trying to stabilize its population at 145 million .
But officials say that the population could decline to 125 million by 2025 unless a host of measures , such as increasing the quality of medical care and reducing dangerously high levels of smoking and alcohol abuse are implemented .
In what may be the most expensive " spontaneous " outburst of grassroots political expression since Mao's Cultural Revolution , the old farming ministry DEFRA paid more than £ 8 m over two years to civic society groups if they spread the correct message about Global Warming .
These included a computer game that was used so infrequently it cost £ 47 per go , and £ 160,000 for a man to drive around with a truck sign .
The payouts are detailed in files released in response to Freedom of Information requests from pressure group the Taxpayers Alliance .
But this is subtly different to your standard quango , taxpayer - money - down - the - pan story - in some quite interesting and non-obvious ways .
The payouts represent a tip of the iceberg ( no pun intended , honest ) of state funding for climate evangelism , which runs into billions of pounds .
These FOIA requests only cover DEFRA , and so exclude cross-department initiatives such as the expensive , umbrella Act on CO2 initiative .
And of course it excludes the really big money , such as the £ 200 m a year to the Carbon Trust , a similar amount to the the Energy Savings Trust , and smaller quangos .
Also not included are state - dependent institutions who are sympathetic to the cause , such as the £ 50 m a year Royal Society , the Met Office , or the British Council , for example .
It 's merely one initiative , called the Climate Change Fund .
The fund was designed to promote " behaviour change " , the even creepier - sounding " attitude modification " and the old standby , " awareness raising " .
The words " empower " and " empowerment " also feature .
Beneficiaries between 2006 and 2008 included the Scouts Association , Women 's Institutes , drama groups , a community radio station , as well as quangos and a number of councils .
Some of the recipients border on self - parody :
" Reasons to be Cheerful , the Carbon Coach , Cheerful Ltd. CarbonSense , Comic Company and National Energy Foundation have come together as Think Purple to help make CO2 visible .
The project has produced purple resources for schools , organisations , and the general public which they hope will help transform how they see CO2 and how they use energy , " we learn .
But few of the messages were cheery .
In an incredible film called Carbon Weevil , humanity " infects " Mother Earth ( a she , natch ) as a destructive insect :
( The insect has only one purpose , to emit carbon .
And mess things up for Gaia . )
£ 164,000 went to employ somebody to tow a 23 foot x 6 foot accessible trailer around .
Three games were produced , costing tens of thousands of each .
Cycling Hero cost almost £ 300,000 .
There are more examples in this video .
So apart from a few million quid down the drain , what harm was done ?
One day , Vince McMahon will pay handsomley to get Ben Bernanke and Alan Grayson in the squared circle .
Until that day , we should just hope and dream .
In the meantime , we have litters and public appearances by the Florida Congressman , who takes the latest AIG " taxpayer payback " opportunity to remind everyone of just how deeply he loves the " we create money out of thin air " institution that is the Federal Reserve .
I write with concern about two announced deals that are lauded by AIG CEO Robert Benmosche as AIG 's plan to ' pay back the taxpayer ' .
In reading through the deal , it looks to me like the Federal Reserve is simply engaged in yet another disguised bailout of AIG .
It 's not surprising that the New York Fed continues to shovel money at AIG using its balance sheet , since this seems to be official policy , but this time , the bailout also involves cheating the IRS .
In describing the deal specifics :
This relationship is not significantly different from just making the subsidiaries collateral for the existing loan from the New York Fed , with four exceptions .
One , the FRBNY 's right are downgraded in this deal from creditors to preferred shareholders .
Two , AIG gets to claim " repayment " and take a tax loss to reduce the company 's income taxes .
Three , the FRBNY credit facilities are already collateralized .
Four , the New York Fed owns nearly 80 % of AIG , putting it on all sides of the deal .
And most brazenly , and deserving of applause , the allegation that Bernanke is implicilty breaking the law by his most recent AIG bailout :
As the New York Fed owns most of AIG , this deal could be considered a faked sale to generate a capital loss for the purposes of injecting Treasury funds into AIG without the consent of Congress .
Please explain the legality of the arrangement .

Newly discovered painted scallops and cockleshells in Spain are the first hard evidence that Neandertals made jewelry .
These findings suggest humanity 's closest extinct relatives might have been capable of symbolism , after all .
Body ornaments made of painted and pierced seashells dating back 70,000 to 120,000 years have been found in Africa and the Near East for years , and serve as evidence of symbolic thought among the earliest modern humans ( Homo sapiens ) .
The absence of similar finds in Europe at that time , when it was Neandertal territory , has supported the notion that they lacked symbolism , a potential sign of mental inferiority that might help explain why modern humans eventually replaced them .
Although hints of Neandertal art and jewelry have cropped up in recent years , such as pierced and grooved animal - tooth pendants or a decorated limestone slab on the grave of a child , these have often been shrugged off as artifacts mixed in from modern humans , imitation without understanding , or ambiguous in nature .
Now archaeologist João Zilhão at the University of Bristol in England and his colleagues have found 50,000 - year - old jewelry at two caves in southeastern Spain , art dating back 10,000 years before the fossil record reveals evidence of modern humans entering Europe .
At the Cueva ( Cave ) Antón , the scientists unearthed a pierced king scallop shell ( Pecten maximus ) painted with orange pigment made of yellow goethite and red hematite collected some five kilometers from that site .
In material collected from the Cueva de los Aviones , alongside quartz and flint artifacts were bones from horses , deer , ibex , rabbits and tortoises as well as seashells from edible cockles ( Glycymeris insubrica ) , mussels , limpets and snails ; the researchers also discovered two pierced dog- cockleshells painted with traces of red hematite pigment .
No dyes were found on the food shells or stone tools , suggesting the jewelry was not just painted at random .
In addition , Zilhão and his colleagues saw an orange pigment–coated horse bone at Aviones that might have served as a pin to prepare or apply mineral dyes or to pierce painted hides as well as three thorny oyster ( Spondylus gaederopus ) shells that might have served as paint cups , holding as they did residues of hematite , charcoal , dolomite and pyrite .
The researchers also came across lumps of red and yellow pigments there that had to have come from afield , such as the area of La Unión three to five kilometers to the northwest , which has served as a gold and silver mining district since antiquity .
These discoveries , in combination with earlier findings hinting at Neandertal ornaments and funerary practices , suggest " Neandertals had the same capabilities for symbolism , imagination and creativity as modern humans , " Zilhão says .
Anthropologist Erik Trinkaus at Washington University in Saint Louis , who did not take part in this study , notes , " I 'm hoping that this will start to bury the idea that 's been around for 100 years — that Neandertals died out because they were stupid . "
The rarity of such finds , however , thus far might still suggest to some that Neandertals were not great minds , " the number of sites that have these pigmented shells from either Neandertals or modern humans is something that you can count on the fingers of one hand , " Trinkaus says .
" These finds are very thin on the landscape . "
Instead of Neandertals and modern humans developing jewelry independently , two intriguing possibilities this discovery raises are that Neandertals taught our ancestors art — or vice versa .
" I have argued that the archaeological culture associated with Europe 's earliest modern humans , the Proto - Aurignacian , features a mix of ornaments of different traditions : small , basket - shaped beads similar to those known from South Africa since about 75,000 years ago , likely to have been used as parts of composite beadworks , and pierced animal teeth , likely to have been used as isolated pendants , " Zilhão says .
Although tooth pendants are entirely unknown in the modern humans of Africa and the Near East prior to their dispersal into Europe , Zilhão adds they are precisely the kinds of ornaments linked with the Châtelperronian industry in France during the upper Paleolithic period of the Stone Age , which is linked with the Neandertals .
" This mix indicates a significant level of cultural exchange at the time of contact , and the persistence in early modern human cultures of Europe of items and traditions of Neandertal origin , " he says .
The scientists are set to detail their findings online January 11 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The reading and writing of poetry and fiction is completely different today than it was ten or even five years ago .
While we spent the past decade arguing over the ways new media have changed journalism , the way we read and talk about creative work has completely changed without nearly so much fanfare .
Simply put , the participatory nature of the Internet has made it not only easy , but nearly effortless , to comment on a piece of creative work .
What was once only the purview of a narrow in - group of critics and scholars is now accessible to the general public .
This much is apparent so far : the general public has a much broader idea of what literature can be than critics and scholars ever did .
The phrase “ open to interpretation ” has never been more apt .
All sorts of new and exciting ideas about literature are sprouting up each day , and this has made more than a few literary purists ’ blood boil .
The first victims of this trend seem to be the Austen scholars , who took an enormous and hilarious blow from Seth Grahame - Smith with his mash - up , Pride and Prejudice and Zombies .
A literary mash - up is a hybrid : half creative fiction in its own right , and half criticism or commentary on the original work .
Besides producing a very enjoyable new work of fiction , Grahame - Smith is providing us with his own critical interpretation of Jane Austen ’s classic .
And his interpretation is a radical one : he ’s telling us that the original Pride and Prejudice is about zombies .
Instead of proving it by traditional critical means , a mash - up shows us what a text is about by altering the text itself .
In a brilliant review on Jane Austen ’s World , Vic writes :
The Bennet family lives in an age when they must be ever vigilant if the girls are to survive until marriage and beyond .
Mr. Bennet ships his girls off to China to learn the fine art of fighting zombies with sword and knife .
Elizabeth Bennet becomes an especially talented fighter , and is renowned for the ease with which she can fend off an entire horde of zombies , slicing and dicing with the best of them .
She had to do just that when she walked three miles to Netherfield Park to check on her ill sister , Jane .
A skeptical Lady Catherine de Bourgh tests her mettle by siccing her Ninja Warriors on her at Rosings , but Elizabeth dispatches them so quickly that she nary raises a sweat .
Mr. Darcy is a fine zombie slayer as well , but the Bingley sisters can’t even carry a sword or knife .
You get the drift .
In Seth ’s book , if you ’re a poor zombie slayer you are either the villain or your brain is toast .
The entire book is a satire , from the inclusion of the gross but well - drawn illustrations to the suggested book club questions at the end , which are quite clever .
You must read this novel with an open mind and maintain a sense of humor or , like the denizens of Meryton when they see a zombie feast on one of their friends , you will upchuck your lunch .
In other words , literary mash - ups like Pride and Prejudice and Zombies are more than just fun , zany jabs at traditional literature .
Consider the wry discussion questions at the end of Grahame - Smith ’s book .
He ’s certainly making fun of the whole idea of discussion questions , but he ’s also asking real questions about the original text .
Here ’s an example :
Is Mr. Collins merely too fat and stupid to notice his wife ’s gradual transformation into a zombie , or could there be another explanation for his failure to acknowledge the problem ?
The less - than - subtle jab at Austen ’s character Mr. Collins indicates that Grahame - Smith has some very clear ideas about all the characters in the book , and that he ’s using the mash - up to express some of his distaste with them .
His mash - up is an interpretation of the novel as well as a whole new work .
Grahame - Smith indicates this same trend when he asks ,
Does Mrs. Bennet have a single redeeming quality ?
There ’s not even a mention of zombies in this question .
Aside from being an amusing read , Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is an extended interpretation .
This kind of re-interpreting through remixing is only possible in light of a postmodern context .
Jacques Derrida showed us how language fails to signify ideas and concepts .
He did this with a made up word : différance .
Différance is a “ non-concept ” that describes the way we use language to construct meaning .
We do this by either deferring the meaning of the original word to a word we might know [ i.e.
A pencil is a type of tool ] , or by differing it to another word [ i.e .
A pencil is like a pen , but different from it in these ways ] .
Derrida ’s point is that if you do n’t know what a tool or a pen is , neither of those example definitions are of any use to you .
Language , according to the theories of deconstruction pioneered by Derrida , is a vast web of différance , a cultural construction that points to meaning by differing and deferring but never actually gets there .
Words with multiple meanings most readily demonstrate this .
A pen is a writing tool , but it ’s also a place to keep animals and a verb for the act of writing .
You can only understand a word in context , but the context itself spirals outward into larger and larger contexts without ever getting boxed into a definite meaning .
Literature , in this framework , is a slightly smaller context in which words swirl around without ever getting pinned down .
This idea is kind of like what happens when you repeat the same word over and over until its sounds do n’t register anything in your mind .
It ’s no wonder Derrida described language as “ play . ”
Other thinkers quickly expounded on these ideas , pushing literature farther and farther outside the boundaries that had previously been defined .
The psychoanalytic theories of Jacques Lacan made us realize that language is a product of subjective perception , a collective cultural construct that in itself can only communicate an individual ’s psyche .
Reader Response theorists like Wolfgang Iser and Stanley Fish moved our critical focus from the text itself to how an individual reader reacts to and interprets the text .
These complex , theoretical ideas have driven us to a world where an undead - hunting Elizabeth Bennett is not only possible , but perfectly acceptable .
In the old world of criticism , one might say , “ It ’s absurd to think that zombies are at all relevant to Jane Austen , ” and that would be that .
Other critics would agree that the idea was absurd , and everyone would move on to an interpretation that seems more probable .
But as these Olympian minds have tried to teach us , there is no interpretation that is more absurd than another .
Every use of language has an element of absurdity in it , and one interpretation ca n’t be “ more probable ” than another .
If we continue to think in terms of which interpretations seem “ more right ” or “ more accurate , ” in doing so we miss out on a vast amount of insights .
With the popularity of mash - ups , we are moving ourselves into the next stage of literary criticism , a post - postmodern world in which virtually anything is possible .
These critical ideas have broken down the old barriers to experiencing the fullness of language as play .
Just as we were able in the last century to embrace free verse without losing traditional forms , in this century we can welcome in mash - ups and previously unconsidered ideas about texts without losing a thing .
In the past it would have been said that a work could n’t possibly mean a certain thing because it was outside of the author ’s experience , but the author ’s experience hardly matters to the reader ’s perception .
In the past it would be argued that the language of a particular text pushed it toward a certain interpretation , but in Derrida ’s world the language itself does n’t directly point to any significant , esoteric meaning .
In this new literary landscape , it ’s very difficult to prove anything , and so we can allow ourselves to embrace everything .
For a new critical world , we need a new perspective on literature .
We need to embrace the same open source ethic that has swept over web culture .
Think of a piece of writing like a source code , and criticism becomes a community of developers tweaking and adding to that code .
Mash - ups fit tidily into that vein .
Every interpretation is different , but none is objectively better than any other .
By learning from each other , critics can create a richer experience for readers in the same way that open source code developers make programs better for end users .
It ’s extremely difficult to give up centuries - old ideas about the way literature works , but the groundwork for doing so has already been laid .
As with everything else in this new technological landscape , the power to form our world is , perhaps for the first time , in the hands of everyday people .
We need to strive toward openness in criticism just as we strive toward openness in all other areas .
As readers become instantaneous critics of poetry and fiction on the web , this openness is essential .

He also obviously believes that the viewers of This Week are blathering idiots if he thinks anyone is buying this hog wash .
And of course he managed to get a shot in on the filthy trial lawyers before he was finished .
George loves them about as much as he loves unions .
MORAN : Let's -- let 's go across the street from the Congress for a moment .
There was a historic decision this week out of the Supreme Court of the United States on the First Amendment , the court holding that the campaign finance reform prohibition on corporations and unions using the money from their general funds to support or oppose candidates , that 's a violation of free speech .
So is this a vindication of the First Amendment , or is this a surrender to the plutocracy ?
WILL : Vindication , because the court recognized the obvious , which is that you cannot disseminate political speech without money .
And , therefore , to restrict money is to restrict the dissemination of speech .
To that end , they have freed up the amount of money that will be spent .
Now , some people are saying , oh , corporations , that means Microsoft will be buying ads .
Microsoft 's trying to sell software .
They 're not interested in getting into political fights .
What this really emancipates are nonprofit advocacy corporations such as the Sierra Club .
I pick that not at random because the Sierra Club was fined $ 28,000 in Florida last year for falling afoul of the incomprehensible , that - thick set of regulations on our political speech .
[...]
MORAN : And here 's the concern , George .
Let me just challenge -- because you 're the advocate on this .
The concern is not just in elections , but when they take votes .
ROBERTS : Sure .
MORAN : They 're going take a vote , and they 're going to know that , if they vote the wrong way , Wall Street can spend against them , the insurance industry can spend against them , directly , right up to the day of the election .
WILL : A mountain of social science has failed to demonstrate that campaign contributions as opposed to the convictions of the legislator and of his constituents determine how someone votes .
Cokie says we 're awash in money .
All federal elections last year , $ 5 billion , Congress up to the president , exactly -- almost exactly what the country spends on tortilla chips .
This is not -- we 're not awash in money .
This is a rich country .
Second , what Matt said is exactly right .
The Democrats are the ones who are profiting right now .
The president came out and said , " This is Big Oil and Big Gas . "
No , it 's -- lawyers are the biggest contributors , and 83 percent of their money today is going to Democrats .
HELP BRING RELIEF TO HAITI AND KNOW WHERE YOUR MONEY IS GOING AND WHAT IT IS BEING USED FOR :
The information at the bottom of this page is from the website Survial Topics.com
There is much more information concerning water and the human body .
We are made up of about 68 % water .
Not only is it necessary to sustain the body itself , but also is necessary for vital body functions .
On the island of Hispaniola , in the best of times , there is a need for clean water .
There are many people living in an ecosystem that does not readily have clean water available .
Snow White and I are friends with a couple who sold everything they owned to move their family to the Dominican Republic to do mission work with the goal of digging water wells so that small , impoverished communities in isolated parts of the country could have a permanent , reliable source of clean water .
Literally , they gave up their own comfortable lives in the United States to bring hope and the basics of life to those in need .
I do n’t know many people who would make such a self sacrifice .
Lindsey Tichenor helps care for their three small children and manage the activies of her husband Bowin who is out in the field daily using his knowledge , sweat and hopefully not too much blood to not only develop the wells , but also to train the people of the villages to operate and maintain the equipment .
When they left last summer , little did they know that they would find themselves on the edge of the biggest disaster in the world for 2010 .
They live about 60 miles from Port Au Prince and when the earthquake struck at 4:53 pm on January 12 , 2010 it shook the ground but they had little in the way of effects .
Very quickly though , word spread of the devastation in Haiti .
Without hesitating , Bowin and his team from the Edge Outreach organization went diretly to the epicenter , not knowing of the dangers in their path or what they would find .
The Louisville Courier Journal has been following their efforts .
Edge Outreach has gone into relief mode for Haiti and you can too .
Lindsey does not know when Bowin will return as he is one who tends to get the job done .
Edge Outreach is efforting to dig at least 100 wells in Haiti to bring clean , life - sustaining water to thousands of Haitians .
The devasted area will need new sources for clean water for months to come .
The work is difficult and laborious .
Digging that many wells will take time , but they will perservere until everyone in the country can have access to clean water , one way or another .
There must be a long term solution for basic needs before the government and global community can rebuild a new Haiti .
Not only will it take time , but also funding to provide those wells .
There are many relief efforts going on with numerous organizations in need of funding for their particular effort .
Edge Outreach did not ask me to solicit funds for them .
I just think its the least I can do to try to help our friends , Lindsey and Bowin , as they do the work on the ground .
They are in country and are on the ground as we speak .
They just need to be adequately supplied with equipment and supplies to bring the precious water to so many in need .
If you would like to give direct aid to Edge Outreach that will use the funds to buy the materials for the wells .
These wells are not a bandaid , its real long term help .
But time is short .
These people need water now and will need it tomorrow .
Shipping water in is only feasible for a limited time .
The best solution is to help the people of Haiti help themselves .
Edge Outreach and people like Bowin and Lindsey are there , they just need some help from home .
If you feel as if you would like to help the people of Haiti and know exactly where your money is going and for what reason , just go to the Edge Outreach website and follow the instructions to make a tax deductable donation .
To make a donation and find out more , CLICK HERE .
Edge Outreach accepts many major credit cards .
” All funds raised in response to the Haiti earthquake will be used immediately to provide clean water for children and families affected by this crisis .
Any funds raised in excess will be stewarded by EDGE OUTREACH for additional and future disaster relief efforts . ”
Importance of Adequate Water :
When faced with a survival situation , clean drinkable water is often the most important consideration .
People have survived without food for weeks or even months , but go without water for even just one day and the survivor will be in desperate straights indeed .
Knowing that water is by far the most important nutrient for the human body ( besides oxygen ) and , in particular , during a survival situation when finding potable water may not be easy , the question becomes – just how long can the human body survive without adequate water ?
To maintain a high level of health and efficiency even in ideal environments , a minimum of two quarts of clean water per day per person is the generally accepted rule of thumb .
In very hot or cold or very dry environments , or if you are physically active , two quarts of water a day may not be enough to sustain life over a period of days or weeks .
* Report ranked firms on disclosure of water risks
* Investors say co’s need to disclose more information
WASHINGTON , Feb 11 ( Reuters ) - Most publicly traded companies that depend on water do not adequately disclose their financial risks to droughts and future regulations , even as water scarcity problems mount , according to a report released on Thursday .
The report produced by Ceres , a coalition of investors and environmentalists and Swiss Bank UBS UBSN.VX , ranked 100 of the biggest publicly traded companies on the quality , depth and clarity of their water disclosure risks and opportunities .
“ This report makes clear that companies are not providing investors with the kind of information they need to understand the risks and opportunities posed by water scarcity , ” said Jack Ehnes , chief executive officer of the California State Teachers ’ Retirement System .
The group , known as CalSTRS , is a member of Ceres .
Many kinds of companies depend on large and readily available water supplies to run their businesses .
Energy , beverage , food and semiconductor companies are among the ones that face risks from dwindling water supplies , especially in developing countries where populations are rising and industries are growing .
Risks include food shortages and higher prices for commodities because of drought , a problem already evident in places such as Australia and the U.S. Southwest .
Some power companies use water to cool their plants .
Others generate electricity at dams .
Both face some of the biggest risks if they lose their water , the report said .
In 2007 and 2008 , several power plants in the U.S. Southeast nearly shut down because of drought , the report said .
“ It is clear that any threat to water security could have a significant impact on the bottom line of such companies , ” said Julie Hudson , global head of sustainability research at UBS Investment Bank .
Among power companies , Arizona Public Service , a unit of Pinnacle West Capital Corp PNW.N , scored highest , in part because it uses treated sewage to cool power plants in Arizona , the report said .
Canada 's biggest natural gas producer Encana Corp ECA .TO had the lowest ranking in the oil and natural gas industry with a score of four .
Oil company BP BP.L scored 35 , the best in that industry .
Dr Pepper Snapple Group DPS.N had the lowest rank in the beverage industry , while Diageo DGE.L , the world 's biggest spirits group , scored highest .
In food , Bunge Ltd BG.N scored lowest , and Unilever ULVR.L scored highest .
Micron Technology Inc MU.O scored lowest in the semiconductor industry , while Toshiba Corp 6502 .
T scored highest .
The companies with low scores were not immediately comment on the report .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Milton Friedman , the Nobel Prize - winning economist who helped shape modern free market economics , died Thursday in San Francisco .
He was 94 .
A spokesman for the Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation confirmed the news to CNN .
The cause was heart failure , according to Reuters .
Friedman , who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 , helped interpret and popularize so - called supply - side economics , which came to dominate much of U.S. public policy in the second half of the 20th century .
Supply - side economics holds that minimally regulated markets offer the most efficiency in the distribution of goods and services .
The theory was prevalent until it fell out of favor during the Great Depression , when Keynesian economics became popular .
Friedman won the Nobel in 1976 for " his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis , monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy , " according to the Nobel Prize Web site .
Friedman 's theories , which included tight fiscal discipline and deregulation of markets , grew influential in the United States after Ronald Reagan became president .
Friedman 's ideas were embraced by President Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s and lauded by many in the business world .
But they were also controversial because of the deep cuts in government spending and the more restricted role they entailed for government in buffering citizens from economic forces .
Friedman was regarded as the leader of the Chicago School of monetary economics and the leading proponent of free market theory .
The Chicago School regarded the quantity of money as a key instrument of government policy , capable of influencing inflation and business cycles , according to his biography at the Hoover Institution , where Friedman served as a research fellow .
The changes brought about by Friedman 's economic work represented a departure from Keynesian economic philosophy , which included generous provisions for the unemployed and wage and price controls .
John Maynard Keynes was an English economist influential in the first half of the 20th century .
Overseas , Friedman 's work helped shape policies used in Chile in the 1970s .
His influence raised eyebrows among critics because of the repressive political situation in the country in that period .
" Milton Friedman revived the economics of liberty , when it had been all but forgotten .
He was an intellectual freedom fighter .
Never was there a less dismal practitioner of ' the dismal science ' [ economics ] , " Thatcher said in a statement published by Reuters .
Other notable figures , including former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , lamented the news of Friedman 's death .
" I am deeply saddened at the passing of Milton Friedman , " Greenspan told Reuters .
" He had been a fixture in my life both professionally and personally for a half century .
My world will not be the same . "
Current Fed chief Ben Bernanke said Friedman had " no peer " among economic scholars .
" The direct and indirect influences of his thinking on contemporary monetary economics would be difficult to overstate , " Bernanke said in a statement .
" Milton conveyed to millions an understanding of the economic benefits of free , competitive markets , as well as the close connection that economic freedoms bear to other types of liberty .
He will be sorely missed . "
Edward Crane , founder and president of the libertarian Cato Institute , said , " Milton was in my mind the greatest champion of freedom in the 20th century .
He was a warm , intelligent , wonderful human being and will be deeply missed . "
" Milton changed the direction of the world , " observed Crane , who recalled attending a conference with Friedman in China in 1988 where Friedman was received " like a rock star " for his reputation as champion of free markets and a free society .
" His first policy concern was freeing people from government influence in their lives , " said Crane .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said in a statement : " Milton was one of the great thinkers and economists of the 20th century , and when I was first exposed to his powerful writings about money , free markets and individual freedom , it was like getting hit by a thunderbolt . "
Even economists who did n't always agree with Friedman concurred on his wide influence .
Friedman " had an enormous impact on the shape of most economies in the world in the last 25 to 35 years , " said Mark Weisbrot , economist at the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research .
" If you go back to his book Capitalism and Freedom [ published in 1962 ] , it was n't even reviewed by major reviewers like [ the ] New York Times .
By the end of Reagan 's last term , most of his policies were implemented , " Weisbrot said .
" Friedman fought a counterrevolution in the 1950s against Keynesianism , " said Weisbrot .
" He succeeded in that policy moved to the right and the concerns of workers took a back seat compared to those of creditors and bankers . "
Crane said that Friedman " never demeaned the motives of his opponents , although they did him .
Milton was always willing to talk to anyone .
He was respectful of a questions asked him . "
Friedman was born in Brooklyn in 1912 to immigrant parents from a province of what was then part of the Austro - Hungarian Empire .
He received a B.A. from Rutgers University in 1932 , an M.A. from the University of Chicago the next year and a Ph.D. from Columbia University .

JREF Swift Blog
I AM NOT " DENYING " ANYTHING
Well , my piece on AGW -- Anthropogenic Global Warming -- has elicited a huge response , both positive and negative .
The subject , dealing with the influence of our species on the observed increase in overall temperatures around the globe -- said to be about 0.7 º
Celsius -- is apparently a matter of great contention , and I almost regret having entered into it .
Almost ...
I must say that much of the commentary I see refers to " about one degree " without specifying Celsius or Fahrenheit scales .
I 'm so old - fashioned and fuddy - duddy that I sometimes refer to the Celsius scale as Centigrade , though it was Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius -- almost two centuries ago -- who came up with the plan to divide the span between the temperature at which water ice melted , and water boiled , into 100 parts .
Only at - 40 º do the Fahrenheit and Celsius thermometers agree , but life is complicated , and we have to deal with such facts .
Since about 1980 , Celsius has become fashionable .
For some perverse reason , and at risk of another storm of comments , I rather think that the USA should drop Fahrenheit -- a German / Dutch scientist even more dead than Celsius -- along with inches , pounds , quarts , miles , yards , furlongs , and other cute but incompatible units we inherited from the UK .
But then , I 'm a confirmed fuddy - duddy , as you know .
Back to business .
Somehow , my AGW commentary was seriously misunderstood by some .
Part of the reason for that is probably due to the fact that I took a much longer , 5,000 - word piece , and cut it down to about 1,400 words to better fit Swift 's needs .
Along the way , some clarity was lost .
For that , I apologize .
But here are a couple of the typical negative comments I received , which are unfounded :
" Randi just came out against the science that indicates that Global Warming is happening , that it is man made , and that it will harm our biosphere ( and is currently doing so ) . "
" I was also saddened by Randi siding with the GW denialists .
He seems to have fallen for a number of logical fallacies , and apparently prefers self - deception and ignorance when it comes to this issue .
Very , very sad . "
Sad ?
Yes , if it were true .
But it 's not .
There were a good number of other , similar comments , all quite wrong .
I do not , and did not , deny the established fact -- arrived at by extensive scientific research -- that average global temperatures have increased by a bit less than one Celsius degree .
My commentary was concerned with my amateur confusion about the myriad of natural phenomena that obviously bring about worldwide climate changes and whether we can properly assign the cause to anthropogenic influences .
Yes , I 'm aware of the massive release of energy -- mostly heat -- that we 've produced by exhuming and burning oil , natural gas , and coal .
We 've also attacked forests and turned them into fuel by converting them into paper at further energy expense , paper that is also burned , in turn .
My remarks , again , are directed at the complexity of determining whether this GW is anthropogenic or not .
I do not deny that possibility .
In fact , I accept it as quite probable .
I remain respectful of science and its participants .
I stand outside the walls of academe , in awe .
Here are a few of the comments that are kinder and much closer to the truth :
" Whether Randi is correct or not , he is honest enough to say that he does not know enough or does not have the expertise to make a fully informed decision .
Right there he is 100 % more honest than any denier ( or religionista for that matter ) .
When in the future he is given the requisite climate change information , if he changes his mind , he will change his mind ( again , unlike deniers and religionistas ) .
For that , my respect for him remains intact . "
" I find it kind of strange to admonish James Randi here .
He 's a skeptic like most of us , and he disagrees with the common scientific opinion right now , with qualifications .
He 's not even trying to be convincing .
He 's reserved , repeatedly showing that he has doubts of the conclusion he 's indicating .
He even states that his opinion is uninformed . "
" This kind of response , that he should be ashamed for expressing his opinion ( especially in such a humble manner ) is unnecessary .
I 'd be surprised if most of the people ( climatologists excluded ) who have concluded that AGW is occurring have looked at any more data than Mr. Randi here ; the venom is a knee jerk reaction to someone disagreeing with them .
Let 's face it , we 're ( mostly ) all armchair experts here .
That said ; I also disagree with James Randi here , but I 'm more confused that he came to his conclusion than saddened or upset . "
" For what it 's worth , I think PZ [ Paul Zachary Myers , a biology professor and the author of the science blog Pharyngula ] is wrong to say Randi has joined the denialists .
Randi simply said he does n't know . "
I must quickly add that PZ and I are friends and allies , and that we 're not at odds .
However , I perceive that he often tends to rush to publication without first checking with the author of some provocative item .
This provides PZ with lots of controversy and attention , but at the expense of the author in question .
I 'll close this matter with very appropriate comments from Dr. Phil Plait , who serves as President of the JREF for another two weeks , after which his position will be taken by D. J. Grothe , who I 'm sure is known to all my readers .
Phil effectively clarified a few points for me :
" Like many others , I was surprised when I read your Swift entry on global warming .
I agree with much of what you said , but as I 'm sure some have pointed out to you , there were two key issues I think you may have not considered .
" One is the Petition Project ; while it has a veneer of respectability , it is only that : a thin veneer .
It 's not a scientific document , and many of the signatories are not climate scientists .
It 's been dissected pretty well on the net , for example , on e-skeptic . "
In consulting this source , I suggest that you go directly to " Case Study : The Oregon Petition " to see just how this " project " was created and distributed .
I admit that I was unaware of the true nature of the Petition , and I thank Dr. Plait -- and several others -- who pointed me to this reference and a much better grasp of the situation .
Phil continues :
" That 's an excellent deconstruction of why this project is not valid .
Note also that only about 10 % of the signers at best are actually educated in the field of climatology , and it 's unclear what ' educated ' means , exactly , in this context .
Do they perform current research in climatology , and are they up - to - date with current thinking in the field ?
There 's no indication of this in the petition .
" Also , you had mentioned how complex GW is and how difficult it is to model .
That too is true , but the observations of the climate are very clear and indeed overwhelming : the Earth is warming , and the effects are entirely consistent with CO2 increase .
The Sun has been shown clearly not to be the cause of this ( there is no increase in solar output , for example ) , and the climate change we observe is too rapid to be due to vagaries in the Earth 's orbit .
It must be something local .
The lack of a simple model does n't prevent climatologists from understanding many of the key issues underlying global warming . "
As I 've indicated , I do not deny the finding of GW .
AGW , to me , is less clear , though I accept that it is likely true .
Phil again :
" Your claim that 'we 're aware that lunar tides , solar wind , galactic space dust and geomagnetic storms have cooled the planet by about one centigrade degree in the past 150 years ' is at odds with the instrumental records of NASA , NOAA , the University of East Anglia and the Japan Meteorological Agency , all of which show a warming of approximately 0.7 degrees C since 1850 . "
I 'm still trying to find where I discovered this gem of text .
I suspect that " cooled " should have been " warmed , " but my currently chemo - altered encephalon stumbled ...
Both my enecephalon and I stand corrected .
Phil again :
" While we are both amateurs , I think it behooves us to give in to those who have devoted their professional lives to understanding this complex subject .
And what they have to say can be boiled down to this : the world is warming and humankind is responsible for at least half of that rise in global average temperatures . "
Accepted .
Again , the importance and the impact of this phenomenon is well beyond my grasp .
I merely expressed my thoughts about the controversy , and I received a storm ( no pun intended ) of comments , many of which showed a lack of careful reading that led to unfair presumptions and interpretations .
Will I do it again with other subjects ?
Without fail , I promise you .
This is what human interaction is all about , what makes it important .
I 've shown that I can make observations on subjects barely within my understanding , while admitting my shortcomings , and provoke reactions that are interesting , constructive , and sometimes furious .
That 's okay .
Language is a means of expressing one 's thoughts and opinions without resorting to fisticuffs or worse .
This encounter was bloodless , gentlemanly , and civilized .
And I thank you all for the use of the hall , as I used to say in simpler times ...
Correction :
The last two quotations in this piece were incorrectly attributed to Phil Plait .
In fact , they come from journalist James Hrynshyn , who was kind enough to call our office yesterday to discuss the evidence for and against AGW .
At London ceremony ...
Liam Gallagher threw Oasis’ BRIT
Award into the crowd tonight as he collected the honour on behalf of the band at the ceremony in London .
The group , who split last year , won BRITS Album of 30 years for their 1995 album ‘( What ’s the Story ) Morning Glory ?’.
Appearing as an unexpected guest , Liam thanked the members of Oasis who worked on the record - except for his brother Noel .
He then proceeded to walk to the front of the stage , where he threw the award into the crowd .
Gallagher ’s reaction prompted host and comedian Peter Kay to brand him a “ knob head ” .
The band ’s 1995 album beat records by Dido , Duffy and Phil Collins to the award .
Oasis split last August following the departure of guitarist Noel .
Both brothers are currently on the verge of launching solo projects .
The ceremony , at Earls Court , has so far seen prizes handed to Dizzee Rascal , the Spice Girls and JLS .
Oasis live
Yes – another Brian Eno post !
But it ’s completely worth it .
This Arena documentary about possibly my favourite music producer is simply outstanding – partly because it contains plenty of Eno snippets for the enthusiast , but also because it ’s beautifully made and put together – fascinating , intelligently chosen visuals and audio accompany the interviews throughout .
It ’s also great for me to see Eno in his Suffolk habitat , because that ’s where I grew up , too – and seeing the familiar serene , slightly surreal landscapes accompanied by his music and words somehow makes perfect sense in a way that had n’t registered with me before .
Favourite moments ?
Learning that Eno comes from a family of “ postmen with passion ” ; what the first important musical experience of his life was ; what digital technology has in common with plasticene ; what some of his favourite productions of all time are ; how his Catholic upbringing influences his music ; peeking at his bookshelves ( and how they are categorised ) ; watching him frustrated by technology ( yes , it ’s not just us ! ) including a synth that ’s so heavily modified it does n’t work any more ; which 70s book on corporate management gave him the tools to understand a new form of music ; how to always hit a bulls - eye with whatever you ’re working on ; why he loves gospel … well go on then , what are you still reading this for ?!?
Thanks to @madebyrobot and @stretta for pointing me to the video on Vimeo , Fjb for uploading it and @kieronjames for giving me the heads - up on the original broadcast .
Want more ?
Get yourself a copy of the Oblique Strategies , watch Eno interviewed by Paul Morley and download a copy of Bloom for your iPhone .
Then go and buy all his albums plus an old Revox on eBay , and start making your own tape - loops : )
Or , just stop for 5 minutes and listen to what ’s going on around you .
I ’m sure he would approve .

A woman who made no effort to feed her four starving children , telling them God would provide for them as they grew weaker and hungrier by the day , was found guilty of child endangerment charges today in a Sussex County courtroom .
Jurors took just 30 minutes to reach a verdict in the case against Estelle Walker , 50 , whose children were so malnourished they could hardly speak when police found them in a Lake Hopatcong cabin in 2006 .
The children — ages 8 , 9 , 11 and 13 at the time — have since recovered .
In finding Walker guilty , the jury of eight women and four men rejected the unusual defense claim that the New York City woman was not responsible for her actions because of her strict religious beliefs and what her lawyer called an extreme reliance on God .
The lawyer , Ronald Nicola , argued his client was delusional and did not willingly deny her children food .
" She did not act to cause harm to her children , " Nicola told jurors in closing arguments yesterday .
" She was acting to her stringent religious beliefs that God would provide .
She lost weight when they lost weight ...
She and the children prayed together . "
Walker 's beliefs have been a recurring theme throughout the trial , which began Dec. 1 .
At one point , when Nicola complained to Superior Court Judge N. Peter Conforti his client was refusing to participate in her defense , Walker passively told the judge , " God will defend me . "
In a separate discussion , she told Conforti she had been directed by prayer to reject a plea bargain that would have allowed her to go free with time served , or the one year she spent in jail before making bail .
She now faces up to 10 years in prison for each of the four counts of second - degree endangerment .
Walker betrayed no emotion , her face blank , as the verdict was announced in the Newton courtroom .
She was quickly handcuffed and taken to the Sussex County jail .
It was in 2005 when Walker , her four youngest children and an 18 - year - old daughter were placed in the cabin by the Manhattan - based Times Square Church , to which she belonged .
At the time , she claimed she needed to escape an alcoholic husband .
But when Walker refused to leave in May 2006 , the church began eviction proceedings and cut off financial support that ranged from $ 700 to $ 1,000 per month .
During the trial , three of the children testified their mother did not look for work or provide for them .
At one point , they said , they went 11 days without food .
By July of that year , when a neighbor called police , an 8 - year - old daughter was down to 34 pounds — the same weight she had been two years earlier .
In his closing arguments , Assistant Prosecutor Francis Koch portrayed Walker as a cunning , evil woman who used her religion as an excuse to get a rent - free lakehouse at the expense of her children ’s health .
Walker , he said , could have asked for help from friends and family members .
" Instead , " Koch said , " she did nothing . "

BAGHDAD — Powerful , coordinated bombs blasted three hotels catering to Westerners and shook a swath of central Baghdad , killing at least 36 people in the latest of four large - scale attacks challenging the government 's ability to secure the country and its upcoming parliamentary elections .
The blasts came the same day the government announced the execution of Ali Hassan al - Majid , former leader Saddam Hussein 's cousin , better known as Chemical Ali .
There was no immediate indication of a link between the attacks and Mr. Majid's ...
And they almost did not have the chance this time .
The set - aside was nearly scrapped last August when female - owned companies that answered the initial solicitation for the Afghan army and police supplies submitted incomplete and mistake - ridden proposals .
Product samples , like the brown shirt Captain Flores displayed , came in the wrong color , the wrong size and the wrong fabric — and sometimes all three .
Ms. Babida and her colleagues quickly realized that the businesswomen did not understand what the Americans were seeking and had never before been asked to produce to such exacting specifications .
Instead of giving up , however , Ms. Babida , an entrepreneur herself who believed strongly in the effort , thought the businesswomen might feel less intimidated if they could ask another woman all of their proposal - related questions .
She and her contracting colleagues agreed to try once more , this time holding information sessions to walk the women through the arcane details of the obscure “ request for proposal ” submission process with painstaking precision .
“ We thought rather than just abandon this , let ’s bring them in so people can understand and try again , ” Ms. Babida said .
“ We have a lot of female - owned companies that want the opportunity and you know they have the capability , they just do n’t understand the language barrier ” and the regulations .
Yet despite great enthusiasm both from the U.S. military contracting experts and the entrepreneurs at the session , the initial question concerning the program ’s viability remains :
Will companies owned by Afghan women have the capacity to meet the requirements of so large a contract for so demanding a customer ?
Awards for the Afghan army and police clothing and gear are expected to total $ 35 million in the first year alone , with a $ 300,000 minimum for each company that submits a winning contract .
Though both their numbers and their successes are growing , to date few female Afghan entrepreneurs have produced at such volumes or won such big contracts .
Businesses competing for the contract , whether as a single company or a joint venture , will have to assemble a proposal to produce one of two groups of items , either undershirts and linens or rain gear and sleeping bags .
Both are complicated propositions given that large - scale , in - country manufacturing experience remains the exception rather than the rule among Afghan entrepreneurs .
The publication of false claims by the IPCC has been compounded by its imperious attitude , says professor of climate change Mike Hulme .
The incorrect statement in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) that the Himalayan glaciers could completely disappear by 2035 is remarkable in many ways .
First , how could such a physically implausible claim have entered an early draft of an assessment undertaken by ' the world 's leading experts ' , as IPCC authors are frequently described ?
Second , how did the claim survive several rounds of peer review from other IPCC authors and outside experts ?
Third , how did the claim , published in April 2007 , remain unchallenged for more than two years before hitting the news headlines ?
But perhaps most remarkable of all was the reaction of the IPCC chairman , Rajendra Pachauri , when the results of a specially commissioned Indian study of the glaciers challenged the IPCC 's claim .
He dismissed the new study as " voodoo science " .
Pachauri 's haughty attitude helps explain why the controversy surrounding the mistaken claim — which , after all , is a rather minor piece of the picture of climate change impacts — is now filling newspapers , blogs and broadcast media .
But to fully understand the timing of this affair we must reflect on the unexpected turn of events in the politics of climate change science over the past three months .
Under fire
The seminal moment was ' Climategate ' , when more than a thousand emails from the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia , United Kingdom , were made public , either stolen or leaked ( see Lessons about science from ' Climategate ' ) .
The emails made front - page news for several weeks and prompted a torrent of allegations about the conduct of some climate scientists and their attempts to withhold data .
Crucially , although the leaked emails hardly constituted evidence of a global warming conspiracy , they legitimised those commentators who have challenged the scientific orthodoxy and the IPCC .
The emails gave such commentators unprecedented credibility in the eyes of the mainstream media and the public to question even more sharply , and less deferentially , the science underpinning human - induced climate change .
Is the scientific evidence sound ?
Or have scientists been sexing up the risks and playing down the uncertainties ?
The IPCC is the obvious target for such questions .
It gained public status and stature through its Nobel Peace Prize , its outspoken chairman and its key role in forging consensus on the effects of climate change , and it has become the ultimate source of authority for scientific claims about climate change .
Many of its pronouncements have been used by political advocates to justify their policy prescriptions .
" As the science demands " was the cry echoing around the UN climate talks in Copenhagen in December , and , indeed , for months and years before .
Inaccurate claims
Both Climategate and the unexpected outcome of the Copenhagen talks have enabled critics to openly attack the IPCC .
As a result , the false claim about the Himalayan glaciers has taken on considerable symbolic significance .
It is not so much that an error was made , whether this is attributed to the original maverick scientist who made it , to the lapse in the IPCC 's peer - review process , or even to Pachauri 's rather arrogant defiance .
No , the error 's significance lies in the fact that it proves definitively that not everything written by the IPCC — or declared by its senior spokespersons — is true .
So sceptics and bloggers are now scrutinising other chapters in the IPCC report as never before to find further evidence of inaccurate or poorly warranted statements and claims .
And some have been found — for example , attributing the rise in disaster costs to climate change and claims that up to 40 per cent of the Amazon rainforest could react drastically to drought .
Time for change
What does all this mean ?
Well , it does n't mean that the well - authenticated , headline conclusions about human impacts on the climate system are undermined .
Nor does it mean that concerns about the risks of future climate change are misplaced .
But it does mean that the IPCC in its next assessment must be more scrupulous in adhering to its basic ground rules .
It also probably means that the rules must be revised , especially regarding the use of non-peer - reviewed sources and the ways that reviewers ' comments are handled .
The danger of claiming , or being offered , ultimate authority — whether for determining how people should live or how policies should be made — is that it can leave you vulnerable to human error and poor practice .
By setting itself up as the impeccable and authoritative source of ultimate scientific knowledge about climate change , and with advocates justifying their case for action with " as the [ IPCC 's ] science demands " , the IPCC 's fall was almost inevitable .
A little less hubris from the IPCC might have made Pachauri more careful about using phrases such as ' voodoo science ' .
And a little less deference to science that ' demands action ' , and a more honest articulation of the ethical and political reasons for their proposed actions , would have left climate change campaigners in a stronger position .

New research from the University of California , Berkeley , shows that an hour 's nap can dramatically boost and restore your brain power .
Indeed , the findings suggest that a biphasic sleep schedule not only refreshes the mind , but can make you smarter .
Conversely , the more hours we spend awake , the more sluggish our minds become , according to the findings .
The results support previous data from the same research team that pulling an all - nighter -- a common practice at college during midterms and finals -- decreases the ability to cram in new facts by nearly 40 percent , due to a shutdown of brain regions during sleep deprivation .
" Sleep not only rights the wrong of prolonged wakefulness but , at a neurocognitive level , it moves you beyond where you were before you took a nap , " said Matthew Walker , an assistant professor of psychology at UC Berkeley and the lead investigator of these studies .
In the recent UC Berkeley sleep study , 39 healthy young adults were divided into two groups -- nap and no-nap .
At noon , all the participants were subjected to a rigorous learning task intended to tax the hippocampus , a region of the brain that helps store fact - based memories .
Both groups performed at comparable levels .
At 2 p.m. , the nap group took a 90 - minute siesta while the no-nap group stayed awake .
Later that day , at 6 p.m. , participants performed a new round of learning exercises .
Those who remained awake throughout the day became worse at learning .
In contrast , those who napped did markedly better and actually improved in their capacity to learn .
These findings reinforce the researchers ' hypothesis that sleep is needed to clear the brain 's short - term memory storage and make room for new information , said Walker , who presented his preliminary findings on Feb. 21 , at the annual meeting of the American Association of the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) in San Diego , Calif .
Since 2007 , Walker and other sleep researchers have established that fact - based memories are temporarily stored in the hippocampus before being sent to the brain 's prefrontal cortex , which may have more storage space .
" It 's as though the e-mail inbox in your hippocampus is full and , until you sleep and clear out those fact e-mails , you 're not going to receive any more mail .
It 's just going to bounce until you sleep and move it into another folder , " Walker said .
In the latest study , Walker and his team have broken new ground in discovering that this memory - refreshing process occurs when nappers are engaged in a specific stage of sleep .
Electroencephalogram tests , which measure electrical activity in the brain , indicated that this refreshing of memory capacity is related to Stage 2 non-REM sleep , which takes place between deep sleep ( non - REM ) and the dream state known as Rapid Eye Movement ( REM ) .
Previously , the purpose of this stage was unclear , but the new results offer evidence as to why humans spend at least half their sleeping hours in Stage 2 , non-REM , Walker said .
" I can't imagine Mother Nature would have us spend 50 percent of the night going from one sleep stage to another for no reason , " Walker said .
" Sleep is sophisticated .
It acts locally to give us what we need . "
Walker and his team will go on to investigate whether the reduction of sleep experienced by people as they get older is related to the documented decrease in our ability to learn as we age .
Finding that link may be helpful in understanding such neurodegenerative conditions as Alzheimer 's disease , Walker said .
In addition to Walker , co-investigators of these new findings are UC Berkeley post - doctoral fellow Bryce A. Mander and psychology undergraduate Sangeetha Santhanam .
A huge crime wave blamed on thousands of Katrina evacuees in Houston and other Southwest cities never happened , say criminologists who warned public officials and the media to be careful in attributing crime to the former New Orleans residents .
Five criminologists who reviewed crime statistics published a study in the current issue of the Journal of Criminal Justice , and found only a “ modest ” increase in the murder rates of Houston and Phoenix , and none in San Antonio , three cities that took in thousands of evacuees from storm - ravaged New Orleans .
The researchers did not find an accompanying rise in auto theft and assaults and other crimes , which they said would have been expected if dispossessed evacuees were responsible for a crime hike .
“ What we found in Houston was there appears to be an increase in some categories of crime , in particular murder and robbery , during the Katrina time period when the evacuees came to Houston .
There was no significant change in rape , aggravated assault , burglary or auto theft , “ said lead author Sean P. Varano , an assistant professor who teaches criminal justice at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island .
Varano said the study was conducted to see whether anecdotal information and media reports about a rise in crime caused by Katrina evacuees was real .
After the powerful August 2005 hurricane flooded New Orleans , Houston 's population swelled 7 percent as it welcomed nearly 240,000 evacuees , while San Antonio received about 30,000 evacuees and Phoenix 6,000 , the study said .
“ We did have an initial spike , but then things did settle down when we got a handle on it , ” said Andy Kahan , Houston 's crime victims advocate .
In early 2006 , then - Houston police chief Harold Hurtt announced homicides increased 23 percent the previous year , and noted that 23 homicides between September and December 2005 involved Katrina evacuees , as suspects or victims .
The FBI 's Uniform Crime Report showed homicides and non-negligent manslaughter increased to 377 in Houston in 2006 , up from 334 in 2005 .
‘ Local speculation '
The study examined weekly crime reports in the three cities from January 2004 to September 2006 , and found there were increases in certain categories of crime after the storm .
But the researchers concluded “ none of the pre- and post - Katrina crime levels was significantly different in San Antonio , only homicide was different in Phoenix , and homicide and robbery in Houston .
Overall , the contention that displaced persons altered a city 's crime problem found limited support .
“ So , what that tells us from our analysis of data , there does appear to have been an effect of the Katrina time period , but I do n't believe it to be a large - scale crime wave like local speculation had suggested , “ Varano said .
Not blaming evacuees
He added : “ One of our takeaway messages is if the evacuees were responsible for this crime wave , we would have expected to see a much broader range of crime to increase besides murder and robbery .
This is not quite the effect the local people claimed on the ground there . “
Gary Blankinship , president of the Houston Police Officer 's Union , said he thought the Houston Police Department had kept track of Katrina - related crime .
“ Seems like there was more crime , and the officers talked about it , ” he said , “ but I do n't have any actual data . “
Varano cautioned media and public officials not to blame evacuees for crime .
“ To say a group came in to a place like Houston and created a crime problem seems to be passing the buck , “ Varano said .
“ Houston , San Antonio , Phoenix ... all had pre-existing crime problems they have been struggling with for generations to correct .
To say they created a tremendous spike in the crime problem appears to be an overstatement . ”

Alan Greenspan was arguably the country 's most powerful financial cop in his 18 years as chairman of the Federal Reserve .
But Mr. Greenspan 's regulatory record has received far less scrutiny than his management of the economy .
That may be changing .
A former colleague says Mr. Greenspan blocked a proposal to increase scrutiny of subprime lenders under the Fed 's broad authority .
That added scrutiny might have helped curtail questionable lending practices now blamed for soaring defaults by mostly low - income borrowers .

1. I 'm Sadek Drobi , I 'm here at QCon with Matsumoto Yukihiro .
Matz , can you tell us what you 've been up to lately ?
Recently , I 've been working on the version 1.9 , which is the development version of Ruby , which is much faster than the stable version 1.8 .
We worked together with other guys from Japan and other countries .
2 . In your talk today , you mentioned that if you recreate Ruby , you 'll include more functions and laziness into the language .
Can you talk more about this ?
At the time I started designing Ruby , my knowledge about the functional programming was limited to Lisp , the very traditional functional programming language .
Actually , it is quite similar to Ruby in concept , not the syntax , but recent functional programming languages like Haskell and OCaml has a lot of advanced functional features .
Some of them cannot be introduced without changing the language like for example , returning the lazy evaluation .
We need to change the language in a fundamental way .
I do n't think I 'm going to introduce the lazy evaluation like Haskell into Ruby , even if I design the language of the whole , but still , some part of the lazy evaluation is useful in the languages like Ruby .
3 . Can you tell us a bit about that part of this lazy evaluation that looks interesting for you for introducing for example in Ruby , if you want to rewrite it ?
The functional programming has many good attributes in the programming , but still it 's quite difficult to understand to ordinary people like me .
So , I 'm not going to make my language into the purely functional , but still , in Ruby 's method named the Map , we turn as the array right now , so it eagerly evaluates to the end of the list or the sequence .
But , if you return some kind of the lazy data structure instead of the array so that you can defer the evaluation until the time when we really need the value of the elements of the list .
4 . You are talking about lazy lists , the yield keyword of other languages .
Languages like to mix object orientation with functional programming , for example , Scala .
There is , at some point , a clash between the 2 paradigms .
Sometimes they do n't mix really well .
What do you think about this ?
Do they mix well , like treating functions as first class citizens in that language that is object oriented ?
To get all the good attributes of functional programming , the language should be purely functional , like Haskell .
The hybrid language , the object oriented programming and the functional programming had to be some kind of trade off .
Now , I 'm thinking about the fact that with side effects we could write some kind of imperative programming , which is not sure for most of the people .
I 'm thinking about isolating the side effect into a small part of the program , like an actor , so they communicate with the channels without any sharing data is the solution for that .
6 . What are the other programming features that you are really interested in .
After you designed Ruby , you thought " Oh , that 's pretty cool ! "
Actor , as I said , is a quite interesting concept in these days , since we had the buzzwords like " Clouds " and a bunch of cores and computers and many CPUs , so that we can utilize these cores in one program .
So Actors and Software Transactional Memory utilize the multiple lines of control or threads will become more and more important in the future .
7 . Do you think Actors and STM is a way to go for concurrency in Ruby ?
Would it be easy actually to introduce them ?
I 'm not sure yet , but it 's quite difficult to integrate the STM into a language like Ruby .
I think I 'd choose the Actors if I were to do some kind of concurrency .
8 . Would you be able to introduce it as a library or do you need to have features ( syntax ) ?
We can cover most of them by libraries .
I think we can do something , probably implementation issue , to solve the concurrency problem , but not the language .
9 . Is it a product that is going on now or you did n't start such a project ?
Some Actors library is available for Ruby and we are working on the multiple VM implementation right now , so that we can run the multiple VM in a process and we can assign these VM threads , the native threads so that we can run many cores in a single program .
12 . Do n't you think that type inference can add a bit of flexibility ?
You can reduce the type , the size of the core , you do n't have to declare the types , but the types are still there , complexity is still there and you can satisfy it .
You still need to satisfy the type systems underneath .
14 .
Is there anything than laziness that you would like to incorporate in Ruby ?
I feel sometimes uneasy by lazy evaluation .
You do n't specify the execution in a language like Haskell .
I describe what I want or what I need , I do n't say anything about to which degree I should do or the programming should go or anything like that .
That makes me feel uneasy .
I sometimes feel like I lost control of the program execution .
16 . Does it surprise you the way people use Ruby ?
Not really , but the application field can be unexpected .
For example , when I wrote my book about Ruby , my first book on Ruby in 1999 , I wrote that Ruby is not good for writing programs running un supercomputers or something like that and a couple of years later , people came in and said " I control my weather forecasting a program with a research program on supercomputer in Ruby " - I was surprised by that !
17 .
This is a surprising use of Ruby .
Ruby is mainly about object orientation and now we mentioned Actors model that could be also a part of Ruby , which is a different paradigm than objects , we talked about functional that could be another paradigm .
Do you see other paradigms that you like about programming other than object orientation , functional and actors ?
Actors is part of the variation about object oriented programming , in the historical sense .
The actor is made by Hewitt , which is driven from object oriented programming .
The actor is not really a new paradigm .
The object oriented programming started in the 60s .
If there was any new paradigm in the future , there should be there by now .
I think we wo n't see any new paradigm of the size of the object oriented programming for the next 30 or 40 years , other than functional programming , of course .
18 . Which is an old one , as well .
Yes , which is an old one , but a little bit newer than object oriented programming .
19 .
The language you mentioned you feel interesting was Haskell .
What other languages that you see interesting ?
You mentioned system transactional memory , what do you think of Clojure , for example ?
Clojure is pretty interesting .
The model behind the Clojure is Lisp , with STM so it 's not really new .
I 'm a language geek , so I 'm not really interested in using it , but I 'm pretty interested in studying it .
As a language geek , Clojure does not provide a lot of new things , it just came in the specs and the behavior and it was quite a good language , though .
20 .
Lisp purists do n't like Clojure because it has much more syntax than Lisp .
What do you think of these debates of purity and all this crazy stuff that we hear from communities ?
I do n't really agree with the Lisp purists , just because in history there are so many Lisp dialects with so many syntax variations .
Clojure follows that history .
Some people consider common Lisp as " the Lisp " , but prior to common Lisp there were so many Lisps and even the Lisp without the s expression , Lisp with m expression or something like that .
I believe that Lisp has a broader range of field than the mere common Lisp or Scheme .
21 . In the same way we can talk about Smalltalk .
Smalltalk has a lot of dialects and some people like to say that Ruby is almost the dialect of Smalltalk .
Do you agree with that ?
Partially , but it depends on the Smalltalk image , how much do you consider the image is important for the language .
Many people consider the language and the image are inseparable , but it's also the environment , like class browsers , and inspector and something like that , but as a language , the basic concept is pretty much in common with Ruby .
If someone considers Ruby as a Smalltalk dialect , I inherited so many concepts from Smalltalk , so I 'm proud of being part of the Smalltalk community .
22 . What do you think that is success factor of Ruby , if we compare it to Smalltalk ?
What is the feature that you really think it gives importance to Ruby ?
Giving up the image based environment .
By that , Ruby is pretty much more lightweight than most Smalltalk .
It 's quite difficult to implement the small tools like the scripting tool by Smalltalk by the Smalltalk program that usually carries a huge image with the software .
It 's quite difficult to make up a small script , but Ruby it does n't have any of the specific environment or the browsers so that it is very easy to do this small task .
That makes Ruby easy to understand and easy to accept for the ordinary programmers .
23 . Earlier , you mentioned the actor 's model could be added to Ruby .
Do you think that it will make people use Ruby even more when they have a predefined model for concurrency and imperative programming ?
I 'm not sure .
Concurrency is very difficult to understand , so making Ruby a concurrent language , makes Ruby difficult to accept for many people .
There is some kind of trade off , easier language and an efficient language .
I have to design very carefully to satisfy both fields .
Working concurrently without sacrificing any usability .
24 .
The problem with the programming language is it starts somehow simple and then you start adding features and the problem is that you cannot delete features .
Are you having this problem yet on Ruby or for now everything is under control ?
In a complexity sense , Ruby is a very complex language , but I try to avoid what I call the exponential complexity .
Adding method or adding simple class is the linear complexity , if they are mutually independent .
The concept which is combined with other concepts makes language pretty complex .
Imagine the C++ templates : the basic concept is very simple , but the C++ template , combined with any other type systems and other features in the language became very complex , it made the language pretty complex .
28 . Today , there are several implementations of Ruby - on .NET , on Java and even others .
Are you satisfied with these implementations ?
Yes , it 's quite interesting and I wish we communicate and share the technology and innovation .
Sometimes I feel like if we went together into the single program , the progress of the Ruby might be much quicker , but the diversity is very important in the open source field , so this is very important for us to progress in certain fields , like the JVM , .NET or some other platforms .
So , yes , I 'm pretty happy with it .
29 .
Do you see some things that added by other implementations , you would like to put in your own implementation ?
The people behind Rubinius are working pretty hard .
My Ruby has a history in gradual improvement , but the Rubinius people have the Ruby design and they started to choose the optimal implementation choice on the language .
I watch carefully about the experimental implementation that , if the ideas prove right , I 'd be happy to merge the ideas into the standard implementation .
30 .
Are there any ideas in that you took ?
Not yet , but their reflection ideas are pretty interesting so I watch carefully about that .
31 . What about the J Ruby and Iron Ruby ?
Did you see anything interesting in the implementation of these ?
I personally do n't follow the Iron Ruby yet , but I follow J Ruby somewhat and the technology is very interesting .
At least they have a much better garbage collector .
33 . With Ruby being integrated with other platforms , on the JVM or on .NET , people tend to use things from these platforms , which makes the program not very portable , right ?
What do you think of that ?
It gets you really specific to some VM , which means you can't use any of the implementations .
Yes , but write once and right everywhere is not the keyword for the Ruby language , it is for a different language .
I think that 's OK for the programs that depend on specific platforms .
Even on my Ruby , the C Ruby , some program runs on Linux and it does not run on Windows that 's the natural way about the programming language .
Unless the platform vendor spends a lot of money and a lot of effort to keep the compatibility along the platforms .
34 . What was the hardest feature to implement in your Ruby ?
Continuation .
By continuation you can easily jump out of the function and get back into the execution point .
It can break a lot of existing code .
A lot of bugs are found related to continuation , but it was quite tough .
35 . Ruby is a dynamic language and there are a lot of dynamic languages out there like PHP , Python , JavaScript .
What do you think about these other dynamic languages ?
Let me put the PHP aside .
JavaScript and Python and Ruby and other languages share pretty much things in common , but they have different design priority .
JavaScript is focusing on being embedded in browsers , so the core data model in the syntax should be kept small .
Python has a very stable design choice .
The people behind the Python are pretty professional and I respect them .
They are equally important in the field of programming .
Aside of the maturity and the richness of the libraries and the add-ons , the core language is equally powerful and descriptive .
Actually the taste is most important to choose between these dynamic languages , aside from outside factors like the boss chose that specific language or something like that .
With Python and Ruby , it is pretty interesting - some people love Ruby , some people love Python and it's just like a dog people and cat people .
36 .
It 's a matter of identity , like where you find yourself best .
Do I choose which language to program in ?

Priest offers ' Heaven bonds ' Venetian cleric in fundraising scheme for elderly
( ANSA ) - Venice , January 5 - An elderly priest near Venice has brushed off his creative financing skills to raise the cash to build a new retirement home .
Feisty Father Armando Trevisiol , who turns 81 in March , is selling coupons dubbed ' Gospel ' or ' Heaven ' bonds for 50 euros to locals looking to get a cosy roof over their heads in their elder years - and perhaps even snag a place in the Hereafter .
The home , which will also serve as a community centre , is 1.5 million euros currently short of funds but was half a million further behind when Father Trevisiol hatched his latest scheme a month ago .
" I did n't know what to do so it occurred to me to sell these shares for people to take to St Peter at the Last Judgement and get him to open the gates of Heaven , " the cleric quipped .
Holders of the paper will benefit from any rise in the real estate value of the complex , have a say in the way the center is run and be given ' preferred treatment ' in obtaining lodging for themselves or their loved ones at the home , he explained .
Heavenly powers should also regard them as " privileged options , " Trevisiol observed .
The scheme has already raised some 15,000 euros through the bonds while private donors - including " a young gentleman " who chipped in with 75,000 euros - have raised the income so far to half a million .
It will take a while yet before the two - million target is reached but Father Trevisiol says he has faith in his flock .
" My own wealth is the confidence I have in my fellow citizens , " he said .
The new facility at Campalto , a small village outside Mestre on the mainland across from Venice , will be the fourth the priest has built in recent years .
Each time he has used slightly unorthodox means to raise the cash : selling off recently restored star - like decorations on his church in the town of Carpenedo ; auctioning memorial stones carved with benefactors ' names ; and even pawning the furniture in his rectory .
Despite the three homes , the area still has almost 500 demands from the elderly .
Father Trevisiol hopes potential bond buyers will follow the example of an elderly woman who bought 17 bonds , for a total of 850 euros , in her name and those of her children , grandchildren and friends . '' A truly wonderful woman , an example of infinite human and Christian goodness , he called her .

Humans may be justifiably nervous when an asteroid passes very close to Earth , but a new study has found that the encounter leaves the asteroid pale and shaken as well !
UH astronomers Schelte Bus and Alan Tokunaga are members of an international team who set out to understand why some asteroids have colors different from those of others .
In particular , they wanted to know why is it that most asteroids have a comparatively dark surface — the result of slow weathering by interplanetary sunlight — but others have a paler color characteristic of fresh , unweathered rocks ?
By looking very carefully at the various asteroids ’ orbits around the sun , the team noticed that all those with pale colors had passed very close to Earth , while those with dark colors had not .
How can a near - miss with Earth affect an asteroid ’s color ?
“ We now suspect that most asteroids are loose conglomerations of rocks and boulders , rather than strong , monolithic objects , ” said astronomer Bus .
“ When one of these rock piles passes close to Earth , it is shaken by the rapidly changing pull of Earth ’s gravity .
Landslides on the asteroid cause the dark weathered areas to be covered by fresh , lighter colored rocks .
Hence the asteroid ’s color , after the encounter , will appear paler than before . ”
“ The more we can learn about what holds an asteroid together , the better chance we have to reduce or eliminate damage to Earth , ” added Tokunaga .
Founded in 1967 , the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii at Manoa conducts research into galaxies , cosmology , stars , planets , and the sun .
Its faculty and staff are also involved in astronomy education , deep space missions , and in the development and management of the observatories on Haleakala and Mauna Kea .
Established in 1907 and fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges , the University of Hawaii is the state 's sole public system of higher education .
The UH System provides an array of undergraduate , graduate , and professional degrees and community programs on 10 campuses and through educational , training , and research centers across the state .
UH enrolls more than 50,000 students from Hawaii , the U.S. mainland , and around the world .
Update : Obama reportedly wants war over within three years
“ President Obama is sending 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan but plans to conclude the war and withdraw most U.S. soldiers within three years , senior administration officials told CNN Tuesday , ” the cable news network reports .
A Huffington Post / AP report notes , “ By laying out a rough timeframe and some dates for when the main U.S. military mission would end , as well as emphasizing stepped - up training for Afghan forces , the president was acknowledging the increasingly divided public opinion over continued American participation in the stalemated war . ”

Huffington Post ’s Dan Froomkin blogs
The latest reports are that Obama will announce a general time frame for withdrawal tonight :
In three years –before the end of his first term –most troops will be out .
That ’s an exciting and ambitious target .
But if it turns out to be just an unsupported best - case scenario , then his promise is just so many words .
To make the case that the war in Afghanistan will truly end in three years — or ever —
Obama tonight would need to announce not just a time frame for withdrawal , but a detailed timeline — along with unambiguous benchmarks .
And he would need to say precisely what happens if the benchmarks are n’t met – i.e. if things do n’t go according to plan .
Because things in Afghanistan never go according to plan .
Otherwise , there will be much more in the speech for neocons and other warhawks than for the majority of Americans who would prefer withdrawal over escalation .
As Gideon Rose , the managing editor of Foreign Affairs , put it to me in an interview yesterday : “ They ’ll get the troops — and you ’ll get some nice rhetoric . ”

As Gideon Rose , the managing editor of Foreign Affairs , put it to me in an interview yesterday : “ They ’ll get the troops — and you ’ll get some nice rhetoric . ”
Original story follows :
After months of debate , President Barack Obama will spell out a costly Afghanistan war expansion to a skeptical public Tuesday night , coupling an infusion of as many as 35,000 more troops with a vow that there will be no endless U.S. commitment .
His first orders have already been made : at least one group of Marines who will be in place by Christmas .

Obama has said that he prefers “ not to hand off anything to the next president ” and that his strategy will “ put us on a path toward ending the war . ”
But he does n’t plan to give any more exact timetable than that Tuesday night .
The president will end his 92 - day review of the war with a nationally broadcast address in which he will lay out his revamped strategy from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , N.Y .
He spent part of Monday briefing foreign allies in a series of private meetings and phone calls .
Before Obama ’s call to Britain ’s Gordon Brown , the prime minister announced that 500 more U.K. troops would arrive in southern Afghanistan next month — making a British total of about 10,000 in the country .
And French President Nicolas Sarkozy , whose nation has more than 3,000 in Afghanistan , said French troops would stay “ as long as necessary ” to stabilize the country .

Obama ’s war escalation includes sending 30,000 to 35,000 more American forces into Afghanistan in a graduated deployment over the next year , on top of the 71,000 already there .
There also will be a fresh focus on training Afghan forces to take over the fight and allow the Americans to leave .
He also will deliver a deeper explanation of why he believes the U.S. must continue to fight more than eight years after the war was started following the Sept. 11 attacks by al - Qaida terrorists based in Afghanistan .
He will emphasize that Afghan security forces need more time , more schooling and more U.S. combat backup to be up to the job on their own , and he will make tougher demands on the governments of Pakistan as well as Afghanistan .

“ This is not an open - ended commitment , ” White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said .
“ We are there to partner with the Afghans , to train the Afghan national security forces , the army and the police so that they can provide security for their country and wage a battle against an unpopular insurgency . ”
On a few of the bigger questions most on the minds of increasingly restive members of Congress and the public , such as how much the additional $ 30 billion to $ 35 billion cost will balloon the already skyrocketed federal deficit , how long the U.S. commitment will continue and how it will wind down , Obama was expected to make references without offering specifics .
Gibbs said detailed discussions on costs would be held later with lawmakers .
ADVERTISEMENT
Even before explaining his decision , Obama told the military to begin executing the force increases .
The commander in chief gave the deployment orders Sunday night , during an Oval Office meeting in which he told key military and White House advisers of his final decision .
At least one group of Marines is expected to deploy within two or three weeks of Obama ’s announcement and will be in Afghanistan by Christmas , military officials said .
Larger deployments will begin early next year .
The initial infusion is a recognition by the administration that something tangible needs to happen quickly , officials said .
The immediate addition of Marines will provide badly needed reinforcements for those fighting against Taliban gains in the southern Helmand province , and also could lend reassurance to both Afghans and a war - weary U.S. public .

The Economic Elite vs. the People of the United States of America : Part II
The war against working people should be understood to be a real war … .
Specifically in the U.S. , which happens to have a highly class - conscious business class … .
And they have long seen themselves as fighting a bitter class war , except they do n’t want anybody else to know about it .
— Noam Chomsky
As a record number of US citizens are struggling to get by , many of the largest corporations are experiencing record - breaking profits , and CEOs are receiving record - breaking bonuses .
How could this be happening ; how did we get to this point ?
The Economic Elite have escalated their attack on US workers over the past few years ; however , this attack began to build intensity in the 1970s .
In 1970 , CEOs made $ 25 for every $ 1 the average worker made .
Due to technological advancements , production and profit levels exploded from 1970 - 2000 .
With the lion ’s share of increased profits going to the CEOs , this pay ratio dramatically rose to $ 90 for CEOs to $ 1 for the average worker .
As ridiculous as that seems , an in - depth study in 2004 on the explosion of CEO pay revealed that , including stock options and other benefits , CEO pay is more accurately $ 500 to $ 1 .
Paul Buchheit , from DePaul University , revealed , “ From 1980 to 2006 the richest 1 % of America tripled their after - tax percentage of our nation ’s total income , while the bottom 90 % have seen their share drop over 20 % . ” Robert Freeman added , “ Between 2002 and 2006 , it was even worse : an astounding three quarters of all the economy ’s growth was captured by the top 1 % . ”
Due to this , the United States already had the highest inequality of wealth in the industrialized world prior to the financial crisis .
Since the crisis , which has hit the average worker much harder than CEOs , the gap between the top one percent and the remaining 99 % of the US population has grown to a record high .
The economic top one percent of the population now owns over 70 % of all financial assets , an all - time record .
As mentioned before , just look at the first full year of the crisis when workers lost an average of 25 percent off their 401k .
During the same time period , the wealth of the 400 richest Americans increased by $ 30 billion , bringing their total combined wealth to $ 1.57 trillion , which is more than the combined net worth of 50 % of the US population .
Just to make this point clear , 400 people have more wealth than 155 million people combined .
Meanwhile , 2009 was a record - breaking year for Wall Street bonuses , as firms issued $ 150 billion to their executives .
100 % of these bonuses are a direct result of our tax dollars , so if we used this money to create jobs , instead of giving it to a handful of top executives , we could have paid an annual salary of $ 30,000 to 5 million people .
So while US workers are now working more hours and have become dramatically more productive and profitable , our pay is actually declining and all the dramatic increases in wealth are going straight into the pockets of the Economic Elite .
If our income had kept pace with compensation distribution rates established in the early 1970s , we would all be making at least three times as much as we are currently making .
How different would your life be if you were making $ 120,000 a year , instead of $ 40,000 ?
So it should come as no surprise to see that we now have the highest inequality of wealth in the industrialized world and the highest inequality of wealth in our nation ’s history .
The backbone of America , a hard - working middle class that has made our country a world leader , has been devastated .
Now that we have a better understanding of how our income has been suppressed over the past forty years , let ’s take a look at how the economy has been designed to take the limited money we receive and put it into the hands of the Economic Elite as well .
Costs of Living
Outside of the workplace , in almost all our costs of living the system is now blatantly rigged against us .
Let ’s take a look at it , starting with our tax system .
In total , the average US citizen is forced to give up approximately 30 % of our income in taxes .
This tax system is now strategically designed to flow straight into the hands of the Economic Elite .
A huge percentage of our tax dollars ultimately ends up in their pockets .
The past decade proves that — whether it ’s the Republicans or the Democrats running the government — our tax money is not going into our community ; it is going into the pockets of the billionaires who have bought off both parties – it is obscene .
For an example of how this system flows to the Economic Elite , just look at the Wall Street “ bailout . ”
The real size of the bailout is estimated to be $ 14 trillion – and could end up costing trillions more than that .
By now you are probably also sick of hearing about the bailout , but stop and think about this for a moment …
Do you comprehend how much $ 14 trillion is ?
What could be accomplished with this money is almost beyond common comprehension .
And this is just the tip of the iceberg that has hit us .
On top of the trillions given to the Wall Street elite , we already have a record $ 12.3 trillion in national debt – and we now have to pay $ 500 billion in interest to the Economic Elite on this debt every year , yet another way they are milking us dry .
When you add in unfunded liabilities owed , like social security payments , we actually owe a stunning $ 74 trillion .
That adds up to a debt of $ 242,000 for every man , woman and child in America .
Trillions more , 25 % of taxpayer dollars allocated to military spending goes unaccounted for every year , not to mention the billions spent on overcharging and outright fraud .
During the War on Terror , the Economic Elite have used our tax money to build a private army that has more soldiers deployed than the US military – a congressional study revealed that 69 % of the “ US ” fighting forces deployed throughout the world in our name are in fact private mercenaries , 80 % of them are foreign nationals .
Private contractors regularly get paid three to five times more than our soldiers , and have been repeatedly caught overcharging and committing fraud on a massive scale .
A congressional investigation revealed this and strongly recommended that we seize wasting tax dollars on these private military contractors .
However , under Obama , there has actually been a drastic increase in total tax dollars spent on them .
In 2009 , just over $ 1 trillion tax dollars were spent on the military .
It ’s safe to say that at least $ 350 billion of that was needlessly wasted .
When you research our tax system you see an unprecedented level of waste and fraud rampant throughout most expenditures .
Our tax system is a national disaster of epic proportions .
It is literally an organized criminal operation that continues to rob us in broad daylight , with zero accountability .
Politicians and mainstream “ news ” outlets will not tell you this , but most every serious economist knows that due to so much theft and debt created in the tax system , the only way to fix things , other than stopping the theft and seizing the trillions that have been stolen , will be for the government to cut important social funding and drastically raise our taxes .
Other than the record national debt , many states are running record deficits and “ barreling toward economic disaster , raising the likelihood of higher taxes , more government layoffs and deep cuts in services . ”
Our nation ’s biggest state economies , like California and New York , are the ones in most trouble .
To merely say that things will not be improving economically is to be a delusional optimist .
The truth that you will not hear : we have been hit by an economic deathblow and the United States lays in ruins .
It ’s not just this criminal tax system ; the theft is now built into all our costs of living .
Trillions more in our spending on food and fuel have been stolen due to fraudulent stock transactions and overcharging .
Just ten years ago , in 2000 , American families paid 7 % of our income on food and fuel .
We now pay 20 % .
This drastic increase is primarily driven by fraudulent market manipulation that drives up stock prices .
Congress uncovered this in 2006 , as part of the Enron investigation .
They found that companies manipulated the oil market to create major spikes in stock values , but then Congress did n’t do anything about it .
Nothing to see here , just move on .
As mentioned before , we have the most expensive health care system in the world and we are forced to pay twice as much as other countries , and the overall care we get in return ranks 37th in the world .
On average , US citizens are now paying a record high 8 % of their income on medical care .
One of the reasons why foreclosure rates are so high is because the percentage of income Americans pay on their housing has risen to 34 % .
So for these basic necessities – taxes , food , fuel , shelter and medical bills – we have already lost 92 % of our limited income .
Then factor in ever - increasing interest rates on credit cards , student loans , rising prices for cable , internet , phone , bank fees , etc. , etc. , etc … .
We are being robbed and gouged in all costs of living , in every aspect of our life .
No wonder bankruptcies are skyrocketing and the number of people suffering from psychological depression has reached an epidemic level .
The American worker is screwed over every step of the way , and it all starts with the explosion in the cost of a college education .
This is one of the Economic Elite ’s most devastating weapons .
To have any chance of succeeding in this economy , it is commonly believed that you must attend the best college possible .
With the rising costs involved , today ’s students are graduating with record levels of debt from student loans .
At the same time , the unemployment rate among recent college graduates has risen higher than the national average , and those who do find work are making significantly less than they expected to make .
This combination of extreme debt and reduced pay has crippled an entire generation right from the start and has put them in a vicious cycle of spiraling debt that they will struggle with for the rest of their lives .
The most recent college graduates are now known as a “ lost generation . ”
The American dream has turned into a nightmare .
The economic system is a sophisticated prison cell ; the indentured servant is now an indebted wage slave ; whips and chains have evolved into debts .
There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation .
One is by sword .
The other is by debt .
– John Adams
Concealing National Wealth
Liberty in the concrete signifies release from the impact of particular oppressive forces ; emancipation from something once taken as a normal part of human life but now experienced as bondage … .
Today , it signifies liberation from material insecurity and from the coercions and repressions that prevent multitudes from participation in the vast cultural resources that are at hand .
— John Dewey
When you take the time to research and analyze the wealth that has gone to the economic top one percent , you begin to realize just how much we have been robbed .
Trillions upon trillions of dollars that could make the lives of all hard - working Americans much easier have been strategically funneled into the coffers of the Economic Elite .
The denial of wealth is the key to the Economic Elite ’s power .
An entire generation of massive wealth creation has been strategically withheld from 99 % of the US population .
The US public does n’t have any understanding of how much wealth has been generated and concentrated into the hands of the Economic Elite over the past 40 years ; there is no historical frame of reference .
This withholding of wealth is truly the greatest crime against humanity in the history of civilization .
What could be done with all the money that has been hoarded by the Economic Elite is extraordinary !
Let ’s consider what we could do with the money that has been stolen from us .
On top of what should be our average six - figure yearly income , we could have :
Free health care for every American ,
A free 4 bedroom home for every American family ,
5 % tax rate for 99 % of Americans ,
Drastically improved public education and free college for all ,
Significantly improved public transportation and infrastructure ,
The list goes on …
This is not some far - fetched fantasy .
These are all things that Franklin D. Roosevelt talked about doing in the 1940s , long before the explosion of wealth creation in our technologically advanced global economy .
The money for all this is already there , stashed into the claws of the Economic Elite .
The denial of wealth to the masses is the key to the Economic Elite ’s power .
Outside of outdated and obsolete economic models and theories — and incredibly short - sighted greed — there is no reason why all this money should be kept in the hands of a few , at the immense suffering and expense of the many .
If Americans could just understand how much wealth is being withheld from us , we would have a massive uprising and the Economic Elite would be swept away , into the history books alongside the evil despots of the past .
For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike , the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves ; and when once they had done this , they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function , and they would sweep it away .
In the long run , a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance .
— George Orwell
Part III : “ Exposing Our Enemy : Meet the Economic Elite ” will be posted on Friday .
Read Part I .
Every year about this time someone asks about Great Lent .
When did it develop ?
How did it start ?
OK , here is the short story .
Though some who read the Bible conclude that people were always baptized immediately after accepting the Lord , it was not necessarily that way for everyone who converted .
Mind you , there is little doubt that there are quite a few immediate baptisms .
But , you might be surprised that the word catechumen ( katechoumenos ) , meaning one who is being instructed in the faith , occurs in Galatians 6:6 .
( In fact , Saint Paul speaks of matters such as dedicated virgins , holy widows , episkopoi , diakonoi , etc .
This is a long way from the congregationalist idea that all these divisions and offices were unknown to Scripture . )
Within a short time , a catechumenate period developed in the Church because of the many heresies that sprung up .
Particularly with the development of the proto- Gnostics ( already listed as heretics in the letters of Saint John ) , the later Marcionites , etc. , the Church became aware that it needed a period of training to ensure that those who were baptized both knew the faith and knew how to live it out in an appropriate fashion .
As the catechumenate developed , part of the teaching was , of course , about prayers and fastings .
And very quickly , a 40 hour prayer and fast before baptism develops .
Also developing in a parallel way was the Church Year .
Already in the Book of Acts , the celebration of the First Day along with an Eucharist on that day is found .
Already in that book , Saint Paul talks of wishing to celebrate Pentecost with the Ephesians .
In passing , many argue that he is not speaking merely about the day itself , but about the entire 50 day season from Pascha to Pentecost .
But , given the Gentile nature of the Ephesians , this is not merely the celebration of a Jewish holiday , but of a now Christian holiday .
These two movements , catechumenate and Church Year , came together somewhat–but only somewhat .
The Vigil of Pascha becomes a very important time for Baptism , and the forty - hour fast becomes a one week time of prayer and preparation , in which both the catechumen and the sponsor participate .
Alongside the catechumenate and the Church Year , the system of discipline also comes into play .
Church discipline is found in the New Testament more than once .
And , so , the Vigil also became a time to release penitents from their time of discipline .
So . . . .
How did it become forty days ?
Well , various fast periods quickly became common .
Nevertheless , one of the earliest documented letters that speaks of a fast period of around forty days is the letter from Patriarch Dionysius ( 248-265 ) to Bishop Basilides .
In it he instructs on when to finish the fast and speaks of the feasting that follows from Pascha to Pentecost , implying at least a forty day and maybe a fifty day period of fasting .
Saint Athanasius ( yes THAT Athanasius ) writes to his bishops in 332 and says , “ The beginning of the fast of forty days is on the fifth of Phamenoth [ March 1 ] ; and when , as I have said , we have first been purified and prepared by these days , we begin the holy week of the great Easter on the tenth of Pharmuthi [ April 1 ] … ”
The way in which he writes assumes that this is an already well - established custom .
Let me summarize .
Within the Book of Acts , we can already see Saint Paul observing the Feast of Pentecost as a Christian feast .
I am one of those who believes that he meant the season of Pascha to Pentecost , as Pentecost is derived from the Greek word for fifty .
Very quickly , a period of fasting develops during Holy Week .
That period of fasting quickly becomes a period of fasting equal to the period of feasting after Pascha .
That is the period we call Lent .

Last week the gaming giant Ubisoft announced their latest DRM invention .
In order to play purchased games customers have to be connected to the Internet at all times .
Game developers are skeptical of this new anti-piracy solution , but could it actually be a step in the right direction ?
Ubisoft has announced its new solution to prevent pirates from playing their games .
The upcoming DRM will require gamers to be online when playing the game .
If no Internet connection is available it means that the game wont work , period .
As with most DRM , Ubisoft ’s new anti-piracy solution needlessly hurts legitimate customers .
Pirates will always find a way around the access restrictions and will be able to play the game offline without running into trouble .
Because of this , Ubisoft ’s plans were welcomed with skepticism among fellow game developers .
Gaming magazine Develop has asked several gaming industry figures what they think about Ubisoft ’s new DRM .
While some are against it and others showed support , the overall sentiment is that DRM itself is not going to stop piracy .
Gusto Games ’ Luke Maskell is the most outspoken of them all .
“ I ’m firmly against Ubisoft ’s announcement , I think it ’s a huge violation of privacy and is only punishing the legitimate customer ; the pirates wo n’t have to worry about being online as they ’ll find a way around pretty sharpish , ” he commented .
Maskell was not the only one with reservations though .
Adrian Hirst , Managing Director at Weaseltron , also stressed that the danger of DRM is that the pirated copy turns into a more desirable product than the retail version .
“ Previous draconian attempts at copy protection have only served to outrage our very customers .
Copy protection that makes the cracked copy of the game more appealing to the customer than the genuine one threatens to turn them away from purchasing at all , ” he said .
Most of the other gaming insiders that were interviewed agreed with this assessment .
DRM will only hurt the game if legitimate customers have to face more restrictions than those who choose to download a copy illegally .
“ I do n’t believe that online DRM on it ’s own will ever stop piracy – your game will simply have that functionality stripped out by various hacking groups , ” Ben Ward of Bizarre Creations said .
“ The only way that DRM will be accepted by consumers is if it is delivered inside a service which brings tangible , real - world benefits with it . ”
Others were less outspoken against Ubisoft ’s new DRM but everyone noted that it will be counter - effective if it ’s too obtrusive or cumbersome .
To us at TorrentFreak , these different opinions clearly suggest that for a long time the digital entertainment industry has chosen the wrong path to counter piracy .
Instead of trying to add more restrictions to the products they sell to customers , they should add in extra features for those who pay for the product .
UbiSoft actually made it half way already by adding several advantages for players who play online , but they ’re not quite there yet .
Logged in customers who play Ubisoft ’s new games online will be able to save it remotely , so they can continue playing the game on other PCs .
Continuing along these lines the company could easily include other benefits and extra features for online players .
If they then drop the requirement to play online , they might actually have a superior product compared to the pirated version .
In the end it ’s all about finding a way to frame or sell DRM as an advantage instead of a restriction .
The music streaming application Spotify is a great example of how ‘ DRM ’ can be an advantage .
Spotify users can only access music when they ’re logged in , which is the ultimate DRM .
Still , no one has even brought this issue up because the service offers so many advantages over most other legitimate and illegitimate ways of enjoying music .
If those in the gaming and other digital entertainment industries start thinking in terms of adding benefits for paying customers instead of useless restrictions to keep pirates out , they would have a lot more satisfied customers .
Perhaps even more importantly , they could sell a lot more products .

If Washington
Wire readers are interested in reading Andrew Young ’s forthcoming tell - all on his decade behind the scenes with John Edwards , the story heats up on page 154 when Young begins to recount how the 2008 presidential hopeful and former Democratic Party vice presidential nominee was taken down by an extramarital affair and a brazen attempt to hide his daughter ’s paternity .
As most readers already know , former Sen. Edwards from North Carolina had an affair with Rielle Hunter while his wife , Elizabeth , was battling cancer and he was plotting a path to the White House .
When Hunter , a videographer hired by the Edwards campaign , became pregnant , Edwards persuaded longtime “ body man ” Young to claim he was the father .
Young went into hiding with his wife , their three children — and Hunter .
Shortly afterwards , the affair was uncovered by the National Enquirer and eventually the mainstream media .
Young describes his alleged discovery of a compromising videotape of Edwards and a naked , pregnant lover , identified by Young as Hunter .
“ It was like watching a traffic pileup occur in slow motion — it was repelling but also transfixing , ” he writes .
Young , who has severed his ties with the Edwards family , tells his side of the tale in “ The Politician : An Insider ’s Account of John Edwards ’s Pursuit of the Presidency and the Scandal that Brought Him Down . ”
The book is set for a Feb. 2 release by St. Martin ’s Press . Washington
Wire purchased a copy Monday at a Washington , D.C. - area book store .
Last Thursday , Edwards publicly owned up to fathering Frances Quinn Hunter , born Feb. 27 , 2008 .
Edwards spokeswoman Joyce Fitzpatrick said he has not seen the book and would not comment on the allegations .
Elizabeth Edwards could not be reached for comment .
Hunter ’s lawyer did not return multiple calls requesting comment .
Here are some of the highlights , which Young says are all based on eyewitness accounts and conversations he had with the Edwardses and Hunter , and in some cases , he writes that he has voicemails , emails and notes to back up his story .
Donations : “ S–t , they love me — they would do anything for me , ” John Edwards would say after getting a big donation , Young writes .
If refused , he would say , “ What the hell — why are they wasting my time ?

When Britain occupied Yemen
No , U.S. President Barack Obama has informed People .
The United States has no interest in or plans to invade Yemen or Somalia — and nor should it .
Out of curiosity , I took a look at the experience of the last western power to occupy part of Yemen : Britain .
The history ’s complicated .
But , very briefly : last century , Britain controlled Yemeni territory at the strategic port of Aden ; the western portion of the country was a kingdom .
In the early 1960s , Egypt attempted to overthrow the kingdom by funding anti-royalists .
Britain attempted to insulate itself by creating buffer protectorates .
Still , the Aden local insurgency simmered , and boiled over when Egypt started funding it as well .
In 1963 , Britain declared a state of emergency and started fighting a full - on counterinsurgency .
Contemporary accounts of the conflict — known as the Aden Emergency in Britain — from Time paint an interesting picture .
For one , they clearly demonstrate how racist the rhetoric was just 50 years ago .
( Some of the descriptions below are , well , uncomfortable to read . )
The clips also show how , despite inferior weaponry , domestic insurgencies so successfully chip away at the will and resources of occupying forces .
First , some insulting if evocative description of the Yemeni Imam from 1957 :
The Imam of Yemen , who acts like a Borgia Pope , is known to have a minimum of five diseases in various stages of arrested development ( rheumatism , heart trouble , bilharziasis , gastritis , syphilis ) , but this does not prevent him from greedily devouring huge meals consisting of nothing but Russian salad heavily splashed with mayonnaise .
The Imam ’s greatest trouble is psychological : he is under the impression that the British are depriving him of huge oil royalties ….
A very colorful 1962 story , " Arabia Felix , " describes him thus :
Ahmad governed by means of spies , subsidies and the executioner ’s ax , decapitating more than a thousand enemies .
He was a man of enormous appetite : he would do away with an entire roast lamb at a single sitting and then gulp down a pound of honey as a between - meals snack .
He had three wives and 40 concubines , but in the last years of his life his potency declined , and he had unsuccessful recourse to rejuvenation treatments by a Swiss doctor .
His luckless harem consoled itself with sorties into lesbianism and erotic gadgets sent from Japan .
Like many Yemenites , Ahmad chewed qat , a narcotic shrub similar to marijuana , and switched to morphine in 1953 — heroically breaking the habit six years later .
A year later , with fighting escalating in Aden , Time overviews the conflict :
Though some scholars maintain that the Garden of Eden was in Aden , the country today seems more like purgatory than paradise .
A British protectorate since 1839 , Aden is a sun-scorched moonscape of thrusting volcanic mountains and rock - strewn wadies .
Temperatures commonly rise to 110 , and survival rations for British combat troops there include at least two gallons of water daily — for drinking , not washing .
Aden is a tempting prize nonetheless .
The British primarily fought from the air , dropping leaflets and bombing villages from the sky ( a strange echoing of today ’s drone fights ) :
In the days when might was still right in the Middle East the British invented a technique for dealing with recalcitrant Arab tribesmen .
The R.A.F. would drop leaflets on Arab villages demanding that they give up fugitive criminals or be bombed .
Usually the trick worked , and the wanted man would be expelled from the threatened village , pursued through the desert , shot down or captured .
On other occasions the population would flee the village , which the R.A.F. would then destroy .
While the guerrilla war waged on :
Sir Arthur Charles , the British Speaker of the Aden Legislative Council , was shot and killed as he was leaving his tennis club at sundown .
As the incidents increased , British security forces arrested 29 suspected terrorists and imposed a dusk - to - dawn curfew .
Last week schools were shut down when students tried to demonstrate , and newspapers were forbidden to " carry news that might incite people . "
British troops patrolled the streets , exchanging occasional fire with snipers on the rooftops .
Until the British finally recognized the fight as futile , and wanted to get out :
In its rush to rid itself of the weight of empire , Britain has often bestowed independence on lands that had no business accepting it …
Few lands , however , have been so ill - prepared to rule themselves as [ South Yemen ] , which Britain announced last week will become independent by the end of November .
[ It ] consists of the port of Aden and 17 feudal satraps whose Bedouin tribesmen eat goat meat and carry everywhere their curved djambias ( daggers ) .
Its life has been disrupted and its British - sponsored federal government destroyed by four years of terrorism and civil war .
And finally , they left :
Critical pedagogy has long condemned grading as an impediment to genuine education , but critical pedagogues continue to grade , as a presumed condition of employment .
“ I hate it but I have to do it ” is their lame lament .
But they no longer have to do it .
Throughout the 30 - odd years of my university teaching career I have always found ways around grading , primarily by giving all A’s , thereby eliminating grades de facto , if not de jure .
Last year for the first time , after long bemoaning my “ anomalous ” practice , York University officials formally prevailed upon me henceforth to designate my courses “ ungraded “ ( a pass / fail option without the fail ) , thereby taking them off the radar screen and perhaps unintentionally establishing a promising academic precedent .
As a tenured full professor , of course , I do enjoy an unusual degree of job security , a privilege provided by a paying public in need of some truth and thus some unshackled , socially responsible scholars .
Moreover , as a unionized employee I am protected by a collective agreement which requires only that I submit evaluations on time without specifying what they “ should ” be .
Thus I am indeed in a good position to challenge the grading regime , but so too are many others who continue to grade .
Why ?
Typically , as already indicated , colleagues express a fear of administrative reprisal .
But they embrace grades also for other ( unspoken ) reasons , perhaps unacknowledged even to themselves .
Grades offer teachers a convenient device for allaying their anxieties about their own abilities by shifting them onto their students , through an endless round of tests , examinations , and evaluations .
Grades get teachers off the hook ; they preserve professorial authority and are indifferent to professorial incompetence .
Bad - faith protestations about administration requirements can mask the fact that grades serve the teacher at the expense of the students , and at the sacrifice of education .
But in all this the primary reason for the existence of grades — publicly - subsidized pre-employment screening — is rarely acknowledged .
Grades appear to be a matter between teacher and student — until they are “ submitted . ”
At that point those for whom grades are really given — those who have perhaps never even stepped into a classroom — gain access to the measurements of their prospective labour force .
Here is the silent third party in the halls of academia , the so - called elephant in the room , to whom academia has too long been hostage .
Eliminating grades removes the elephant from the room , emancipates academia , and reintroduces education .
The elimination of grades at a stroke shifts academic attention from evaluation to education , where it belongs .
When skeptical colleagues protest that it is not fair for me to give the same grade both to people who work hard and to people who fail even to show up , I remind them that these people are not getting the same reward because the people who work hard also get an education .
“ Oh , yeah , ” they say , remembering as an afterthought what should be at the forefront of their profession .
Students themselves have collectively never resisted my refusal to grade them , and our experiences have been mutually rewarding beyond measure , and all measurement .
With grades no longer a matter of concern , no time is ever wasted on discussions about evaluation — heretofore students ’ primary preoccupation .
Without having to fear or defer to professors or peers , students are freed for forthright and authentic engagement , an essential ingredient of genuine education , and discover that they are not alone , despite the rituals of competitive individualism enforced everywhere else around them .
With the substitution of encouragement for evaluation , intellectual excitement becomes the defining element in the educational ethos , replacing anxiety -- which , as every parent knows , is lethal to learning .
Abandoning grades annuls alienation : students no longer depend on others for a sense of their own worth .
Without grades , students do not have to try to read the professor ’s mind — an impossible task , anyway , so philosophers tell us — and can instead concentrate upon reading their own minds , self - knowledge being the grail of education .
With grades gone , and having thus side - stepped the institutionally routinized regime of infantilization so corrosive of self - respect , self - confidence and self - worth , students can now begin to take themselves and their own thoughts seriously — for too many an altogether novel experience .
This is the only true end of education .
The elimination of grades is no longer merely a theoretical proposition .
It is an actuality , and a precedent , given my experience at York University .
I now teach officially - designated “ ungraded ” courses with the formal sanction of the Office of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and in full recognition of the Vice - President / Academic .
From this fertile ground , I advise my colleagues across the country :
Try it ; you are bound to like it .
And so , I suspect , are your students , who will at last start receiving what they have been presumably been paying for and what we have been professing to provide .

1942 : British physicist Stephen Hawking is born .
Hawking was born in Oxford , where his parents moved to escape the German Blitz on London .
In an interesting historical aside , his birth came on the 300th anniversary of Galileo 's death .
Though naturally predisposed to mathematics , young Hawking switched to physics , because University College at Oxford did not offer the discipline .
He turned out to be pretty good at physics , too .
From there , Hawking moved on to Cambridge to do his research in cosmology .
It was while attending Cambridge that he developed the first signs of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , the incurable neurological disease .
The average ALS patient dies within a few years of diagnosis .
Defying all odds , Hawking has managed to live with it for nearly five decades .
In fact , Hawking has done far more than simply " live with ALS . "
Almost willfully ignoring his disability , which leaves him paralyzed and unable to speak or walk , Hawking has carved out a brilliant career as a theoretical physicist specializing in the study of the universe .
His best - seller on the subject , A Brief History of Time , helped raise public consciousness regarding the nature of the universe , its possible beginnings and its probable end .
The very slow progression of Hawking 's disease remains a mystery .
A special computer rigged to his wheelchair and operated by a " blink switch " attached to his glasses gives him a limited self - sufficiency , although he still requires around - the - clock nursing care .
In April 2007 , Hawking realized his dream of taking a zero - gravity flight , making him the first quadriplegic ever to do so .

A landmark class action case is under way in a New York federal court , with victims of apartheid in South Africa suing corporations that they say helped the pre-1994 regime .
Among the multinational corporations are IBM , Fujitsu , Ford , GM and banking giants UBS and Barclays .
The lawsuit accuses the corporations of “ knowing participation in and / or aiding and abetting of the crimes of apartheid ; extrajudicial killing ; torture ; prolonged unlawful detention ; and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment . ”
Attorneys are seeking up to $ 400 billion in damages .
The late anti-apartheid activist Dennis Brutus , who died just weeks ago , is a listed plaintiff .
Back in 2008 , he told me that “ for [ the corporations ] , apartheid was a very good system , and it was a very profitable system . ”
As the U.S. observes the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s birthday , marks the first anniversary in office of the first African - American president and ponders the exposure of a racial gaffe spoken by Sen.
Harry Reid , the issue of race is front and center , making this case timely and compelling .
The Alien Tort Statute dates from the U.S. Revolutionary
War era and allows people from outside the United States to bring a civil suit against another party for alleged crimes committed outside the United States .
Cases have been brought in recent years to address forced labor on an oil pipeline in Burma , the killing of labor organizers in Colombia and the killing of activists in the Niger delta .
This suit alleges that the apartheid regime could not have succeeded in its violent oppression of millions of people without the active support of the foreign corporations .
Ford and General Motors built manufacturing centers in Port Elizabeth , South Africa , where Dennis Brutus grew up .
He told me , “ They were using … very cheap black labor , because there was a law in South Africa which said blacks are not allowed to join trade unions , and they ’re not allowed to strike , so that they were forced to accept whatever wages they were given .
They lived in ghettos … actually in the boxes in which the parts had been shipped from the U.S. to be assembled in South Africa .
So you had a whole township called Kwaford , meaning ‘ the place of Ford . ’ “
Likewise with IBM and Fujitsu .
The complaint states , “ The South African security forces used computers supplied by … IBM and Fujitsu … to restrict Black people ’s movements within the country , to track non-whites and political dissidents , and to target individuals for the purpose of repressing the Black population and perpetuating the apartheid system . ”
Black South Africans were issued passbooks , which the apartheid regime used to restrict movement and track millions of people , and to enable politically motivated arrests and disappearances over decades .
UBS and Barclays , the suit alleges , “ directly financed the South African security forces that carried out the most brutal aspects of apartheid . ”
The United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid stated , in 1979 , that “ we learn today that more than $ 5.4 billion has been loaned in a six - year period to bolster a regime which is responsible for some of the most heinous crimes ever committed against humanity . ”
Banks ( including UBS ) were punished for helping the Nazis during World War II , so precedent exists for reparations in the case of apartheid .
One of the plaintiffs ’ attorneys , Michael Hausfeld , told me : “ Who is a corporation and what are its responsibilities ?
If companies can affect lives in ways that make those lives worse , so that people are suppressed or terrorized … you are basically ascribing to eternity the fact that companies can act with both impunity and immunity . ”
South Africa went through a historic process after apartheid , the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( TRC ) , led by Nobel Peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu .
Thousands of people took responsibility for their actions , along with scores of South African corporations .
Not one multinational company accepted the invitation to speak at the TRC .
The case , says Marjorie Jobson , national director of the Khulumani Support Group , which is filing the lawsuit , “ takes forward the unfinished business of the TRC . ”
The election of Barack Obama , the son of an African , was a historic moment in the fight against racism .
But unless U.S. courts are open to addressing wrongs , past and present , corporations will still feel free to go abroad and profit from racist and repressive policies .

Yale University scientists have streamlined the process for synthesizing a family of compounds with the potential to kill cancer and other diseased cells , and have found that they represent a unique category of anti-cancer agents .
Their discovery appears in this week 's online edition of the Journal of the American Chemical Society .
The team studied a family of compounds known as the kinamycins , which are naturally produced by bacteria during metabolism and are known for their potent toxicity .
For years scientists have guessed that a core structure common to the different compounds within the group was responsible for this toxicity .
Until now , chemists could not study the core structure because there was no simple way to create it in the laboratory .
Now the Yale team has developed a new method to recreate this structure that allows them to synthesize the kinamycins with much greater efficiency than previously possible .
While scientists have produced kinamycins in the laboratory in the past , the Yale team was able to halve the number of steps required to go from simple , easily obtainable precursors to the complete molecule -- from 24 down to 12 .
" By shortening the synthesis we can now prepare these molecules in the quantities required for further studies , including animal studies and even clinical trials , " said Seth Herzon , assistant professor of chemistry and lead author of the study .
Working with researchers at the Yale School of Medicine and the Yale Chemical Genomics Screening Facility , the team has begun testing several of the compounds against cancer cells , with promising preliminary results .
Next , they will work to understand the exact mechanism that makes the compounds -- which are benign on their own -- highly toxic once they penetrate cells .
" The key to success will be whether we can develop selectivity -- whether we can kill cancer cells in the presence of non-cancerous tissue , " Herzon said .
" Based on what we already know about the chemical reactivity of these molecules , I 'm optimistic we can do this . "
The reactive core of the kinamycins also plays a key role in another compound the team is studying , called lomaiviticin A , which is even more toxic and could prove even more effective in destroying cancer cells .
" Lomaiviticin A is the big fish .
It 's more potent than the kinamycins , but it's also much harder to synthesize , " Herzon said .
Both the kinamycins and lomaiviticin A are unique in their toxicity profiles , Herzon said , representing a new category of anti-cancer agents .
" There 's no close analogy to draw from to predict how these molecules will behave , which will make it especially interesting to see where this research takes us , " Herzon said .
" This research involves a lot of exciting chemistry , but it also has real applications in biology and human medicine . "
Other authors of the study include Christina Woo , Liang Lu , Shivajirao Gholap and Devin Smith , all of Yale University .
Funding for this research was provided by Yale University and Eli Lilly .
And so the Tea Party wars continue in San Antonio , TX .
Progressives in San Antonio , anxious to show the rest of the US that Texans are n't all rabid , right wing Tea Partiers or anti-government , anti-tax secessionists , decided to help the San Antonio Tea Party celebrate their one year anniversary .
From the MoveOn press release :
As the San Antonio Tea Party throws a party for itself , and listens to the tired , repetitive message of woe from " Joe the Plumber " , San Antonio MoveOn members have invited San Antonio ’s own " Mike the Plumber " to speak about his real plumbing business and his work installing solar hot water heaters – and why investing in the small businesses that build our clean energy future is good for business owners like him , good for his customers and the environment , good for San Antonio , good for Texas and good for America .
The San Antonio Tea Party has had multiple problems in the past year :
Split between San Antonio Tea Party and Tea Party Support
San Antonio Tea Party spends almost $ 250,000 in a couple of months , records posted online
As part of the recovery process , they decided to plan an all day extravaganza .
Beginning at 12:30 - you could enjoy lunch with Joe the Plumber for $ 40 .
Pictures with Joe were $ 10 .
Starting at 2 pm , you could rally with your fellow patriots and listen to Joe and some Oathkeepers tell us why our nation is going to progressive hell .
The cost of a chair to sit is $ 2 , but you could bring your own if you like .
And , to top it all off , at 4:45 , you could listen to a well known Climate Change denier explain why excess snow only helps prove his point , there is no such thing as Climate Change .
We chose not to stay that late .
Because the Tea Party gets press coverage fairly easily in San Antonio , we decided the intelligent thing to do would be to follow the press .
After all , the Tea Party has done it to us all year long .
To make it easier , we planned a short program with a few progressive speakers that answer directly to the complaints of Joe the Plumber and the need for clean energy jobs in San Antonio .
And we thought hard about visuals - no looking like astroturfers for us .
Several came dressed in work clothes with plungers in hand , everyone held signs , we brought balloons because it is a birthday party , after all , and we proudly held two American flags .
To attract the press , we advertised all of that in our press release .
We then sent the press release two different times , once on Friday and once again Sunday morning .
We then followed up with press calls and asked , " Will you send a reporter ? " :
*** VISUALS : Flags , balloons , signs promoting green jobs and clean energy , fired up citizens
Including some dressed as plumbers with their tools ***
You know , the press loves visuals .
I have to say here , thanks to MoveOn.org for their media training !
It has made a huge difference to our media coverage here in San Antonio !
We started the rally with a honk - n- wave on Commerce Street while the press did one - on - one interviews with a few of our members .
It helps if you have folks lined up to interview and in San Antonio it 's always a good idea to have Spanish speakers .
We had three and Univision walked away happy - often at political rallies ( especially around the Tea Party ) it is hard to find more than a single Spanish speaker .
I wonder why ?
After a little fiasco with late speakers and one no - show , we managed to pull together our act .
If you ever hold a rally of your own , do n't expect it to run perfectly !
Just go with the flow !
We had Mike the Plumber speak about his local business , Roland spoke about solar energy and peak oil , and Randy spoke about the future of Geo - Thermal for Texas .
Our wonderful Jolene MCed the whole event in plumber regalia !
Then we marched down the street to the Tea Party rally .
They had their professional set - up in a rented space , with microphones and all .
The comparison between the two is almost comic .
They obviously had money for their event .
We run our events of volunteer power and donated supplies .
We can't even afford the permit for sound amplification on city street , so we just yell in order to be heard .
We marched down the street chanting " Green Jobs Now " , stopped across the street facing the rally and sang " Happy Birthday ! "
But not to the Tea Party .
We sang for the Stimulus Package instead .
The response from over the fence - a couple of signs .
Our point was n't to be a pain in the side of the Tea Party .
Our point was to get media coverage .
And it worked .
I watched us two times last night , once on KENS5 and once on KSAT12 .
We had fair coverage from both .
Our side of the story was told .
Both were going to repeat coverage on the 10 o'clock news .
We had cameras out there from four different stations , a couple of free lancers , and a print reporter from our local weekly , The Current .
If I get any online links to coverage , I will be sure to update the story !
( update ) We found coverage from the local Tea Party itself on They Think You 're Stupid :
He Who Shall Not Be Named did not show up , but Move On .
Org did .
The sang " " Happy Birthday " to us at the end of their counter protest .
Gotta hand Angie Drake that one -- it was a nice touch .
Angie and I talked afterward ( Yes , the local Move On coordinator and I can be civil to one another .
Hell , I like Angie and she 's a military spouse .
Not a bad person , just ... wrong on her politics . )
Remember , your opponent is n't necessarily evil .
Is n't that the mistake too many on the other side make about us ?
We resist " The One ! " so we must be evil ....
So , too , with them .
( upate ) From an email of a local MoveOn member :
I do n't usually watch KENS -- in fact , I barely watch local news at all , but last night , since I had been out of town all day , I decided to click around and see if there was any coverage of the rally .
There might have been something on the other stations , but I do n't know , because once I saw how they were going to cover it on KENS , I stuck around so that I would n't miss it .
The best part is , they did n't include any political bias in their coverage , you could n't tell what they were thinking ( you know , like in the olden days on the news , ha ! ) .
In the meantime , enjoy some more pictures !
And consider holding a rally of your own !
Just minutes after the Fiesta Bowl halftime show , Boise State Sad Cowbell Girl ( BSSCG ) launched into Internet History and began the Uninspired Cowbell Twang That Launched A Thousand Animated GIFs .
We all spent the rest of the game trying to figure out how we could have fun with the image of her despondent bell - smacking effort .
Turns out , we ’re all evil monsters ( then again , you already knew that ) .
According to a Boise State student and a Chicago sportswriter , BSSCG is actually blind , which explains why she seemed so nonplussed with a camera right in her face .
I do not look forward to our time in hell together , playing cowbell for all of eternity .
The Supreme Court ’s seismic January ruling that corporations are free to spend unlimited amounts of their profits to advertise for or against candidates may have been the latest shakeup of campaign finance – but gaping holes already allow corporations to spend enormous sums without leaving a paper trail , a Raw Story investigation has found .
Campaign finance experts confirmed that though disclosure rules remained intact in the new Supreme Court decision , there are effective methods to circumvent them .

Ciara Torres - Spelliscy , an attorney and campaign finance expert at New York University ’s Brennan Center for Justice , said corporations already effectively end - run campaign finance law by shuffling money through trade associations .
“ One of their favorites right now is spending through trade associations , ” Torres - Spelliscy said .
Trade associations are considered tax - exempt non-profit organizations under US law .
While they must report contributions received from other corporations to the Internal Revenue Service , the document itself remains confidential and is not made available to the public .
“ Money coming through the trade association does n’t get disclosed , ” Torres - Spelliscy explained .
“ You ca n’t tell if it came from particular corporations . ”
For example , she said , “ The disclaimer form is likely to just say , ‘ This is brought to you by the Chamber of Commerce , ’ with no extra ability to see behind that . ”

The Chamber of Commerce is the world ’s largest trade association representing at least 300,000 businesses and organizations .
A fellow non-profit that works on campaign finance , the Center for Political Accountability , calls trade associations “ the Swiss bank accounts of American politics . ”
“ What was the lesson from Watergate ? ” Torres - Spelliscy quipped .
“ Follow the money ? ”

Health insurers , pharmaceutical companies embrace loophole
Trade associations such as America ’s Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) have had an enormous impact on the health insurance reform bills pending in Congress .
In fact , AHIP was recently found to have solicited $ 10 million to $ 20 million from leading health insurance companies — UnitedHealth , Wellpoint , Aetna , Cigna and Humana among them — and funneled it secretly to the US Chamber of Commerce to underwrite anti-reform attack ads .
ADVERTISEMENT
Asked about the story , the Chamber ’s top lobbyist told the reporter , “ No comment .
We never disclose funding or what we ’re going to do . ”
The Chamber of Commerce did not respond to a Raw Story request for comment .
Raw Story ’s 2008 award - nominated investigative series The Permanent Republican Majority noted that , “ Despite its seemingly bipartisan name , the Chamber of Commerce has operated as a pro-Republican powerhouse since the fervently anti-regulation Thomas J. Donahue became president in 1997 . ” Raw ’s Larisa Alexandrovna and Muriel Kane uncovered , for instance , that the Chamber , under Donahue ’s leadership , had an indirect role in the defeat and political prosecution of Governor Don Siegelman and in targeting sitting judges in contested state elections .
President of the Center for Political Accountability Bruce Freed told Raw Story that trade associations also use other trade associations in this manner as “ blinds for ads ” to “ launder their money . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s a way for the industry to avoid responsibility for those ads , ” Freed remarked .
Karl Sandstrom , the Center ’s lead counsel , noted that it is n’t only the public that remains in the dark over the “ Swiss bank ” loophole .
He said that when the Center surveyed boards of directors of companies , the majority of them just assumed their businesses ’ contributions supporting political ads were being disclosed .
“ It ’s just almost a working assumption , ” Sandstrom said .
Most of the boards of directors , he said , were “ shocked to learn there is no disclosure . ”

While these types of contributions prior to the new Court ruling could only be used for “ issue ads ” — political advertisements that do not expressly advocate for or against a particular candidate — many such ads were often accused of blurring this line and having nearly the same impact as express advocacy ads .
Christian Hillard , spokesman for the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) , confirmed Tuesday that the FEC has “ no authority over issue ads . ”
Corporate funding of issue ads through trade associations has “ no filing requirements with us , ” he told Raw Story .
New ruling ’s impact on the trade association loophole
ADVERTISEMENT
Now that corporations , including trade associations , are free to spend funds on political ads – which cannot be coordinated with a candidate or political party but which expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate – the line between funding issue ads and express advocacy ads has been largely erased .
Campaign finance experts expressed grave concern in conversations with Raw Story .
Paul S. Ryan , an attorney and expert in federal election law at the Campaign Legal Center in Washington , D.C. , asserted that Congress did not contemplate this new Court ruling when it wrote the laws for disclosure related to independent expenditures or electioneering communications , because at the time such corporate spending was prohibited .
Ryan said that it ’s imperative that the FEC addresses disclosure requirements pertaining to this decision .
“ Take hypothetically a group like the Chamber of Commerce , ” he explained .
“ The Chamber collects money from lots of other corporations .
So the question becomes :
What kind of disclosure are we really going to get when the FEC gets around to promulgating rules to implement this Supreme Court decision ? ”
“ Yes , the Chamber needs to file paperwork with the FEC saying we ran an ad saying Vote for Candidate Smith , ” he continued .
“ But does the Chamber need to tell the FEC where it got its money to pay for that ad ?
And when the FEC adopts its rules to implement this new Supreme Court decision , the FEC will likely say , ‘ Chamber of Commerce , you only need to tell us where you got your money if that money was given to you specifically designated to run election ads . ’ ”

Ryan and other campaign finance experts told Raw Story this is a simple dodge .
“ It ’s child ’s play to get around that type of disclosure , ” Ryan said , adding , “ It ’s unclear whether the Court was being naive or disingenuous ” when it touted disclosure provisions during its decision .
He explained that , for example , all the Chamber of Commerce has to do is tell other corporations , “ Give us money and we ’ll make sure it advances your business interests . ”
“ So as long as the donors do n’t say to the Chamber , ‘ We ’re giving you this money to run political ads , ’ as long as they refrain from saying that , then their identity can continue to be shrouded or hidden from the public . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The Center for Accountability ’s Sandstrom agreed , saying this type of disclosure “ is easily avoided ” and adding , “ As long as you do n’t designate it , you wo n’t be disclosed . ”
The Chamber of Commerce , in fact , argued against any disclosure in the Citizens United case .
“ Their first brief filed in Citizens United is on the disclosure issue , ” Sandstrom said .
“ They argued that they would raise substantially more money the more they could keep it anonymous . ”
FEC spokesman Hillard said that the FEC was still examining the impact of the Supreme Court ’s decision and would not comment on anything pertaining directly to that ruling , including disclosure provisions .

Vidic has missed the last nine matches since withdrawing from the FA Cup third round tie against Leeds United on 3 ­January , citing a nerve problem in his calf , but Ferguson had been certain that a defender who has been renowned in the past for his desire to put himself on the line for his team would be in ­contention tomorrow .
Vidic 's withdrawal is ­understood to have gone against the feelings of the club 's medical staff and Ferguson hinted at major doubts about the player 's commitment .
" It 's a difficult one because he feels he needs to do a lot of training , " Ferguson said .
" He has been training for the last 10 days but he still does not feel he is ready to take part in games .
That 's something we just have to be patient with and that 's what we are doing at the moment . "
The manager 's tone was one of exasperation rather than sympathy , ­leading to questions about whether he saw Vidic remaining at the club beyond the end of next season .
Ferguson robustly insisted there were no plans to sell him but his frustration was evident going into a tie in which he already has misgivings about Rio Ferdinand 's involvement in the centre of defence .
Ferdinand has been involved in only two matches during four months in which he has had intensive treatment on his recurrent back problems , and ­Ferguson admitted that he would have to think closely about whether the England international should be involved or whether it was too risky .
" There 's nothing wrong with him mentally but anyone who has had a back injury , even if they are not a sportsman , will know how difficult it can be , " he said .
" We have put a lot of work into him and he has trained very well .
He has n't missed a session in the last six or seven weeks .
We have to make a decision whether he is right to play . "
Ferguson went on to say that he planned to use Ferdinand from the start but it is anything but ideal preparation before a match in which Ryan Giggs will be another notable absentee .
Privately , Ferguson is said to have informed colleagues that Vidic does not " want to hang around " and this is not the first time he has expressed ­frustration with the Serb 's newly acquired habit of pulling out of matches at late notice .
When he withdrew from the Leeds tie during the warm - up an exasperated Ferguson admitted that he " could n't tell you " why .
The 28 - year - old did the same before the game against Arsenal on 31 January and , in the meantime , has repeatedly been linked to , among others , Milan .
Ferguson conceded that " a lot of clubs want to buy our players . "
Asked if he wanted to keep Vidic , he replied : " Of course we want him to stay .
He 's a great player , one of the best centre - backs in the world .
Of course we want to keep him . "
The game will see David Beckham face United for the first time since leaving the club in 2003 , and the former England ­captain made it clear he harbours no bad feelings towards Ferguson despite the acrimonious manner of his departure .
Beckham described his former ­manager as a " father figure " and insisted he had only good memories of his time at the club .
" He always has been and he always will be .
No matter what has been said in the past , whether good or bad , I only remember the good times , " he said .
" He was the man who gave me my chance to play for club I had always dreamed of playing for .
" For me they were only good times .
Sir Alex is respected throughout ­football all around the world .
Clubs move forwards and it was my time to leave Manchester United in 2003 , and I moved on .
I definitely hold nothing against the manager , he 's an incredible man . "

There is a growing consensus that it is time for President Obama to fire Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
While he is at it , he needs to clean house by firing Larry Summers , by banning Robert Rubin from Washington , and by appointing a replacement for Chairman Bernanke .
It is time for a fresh start .
Geithner is facing renewed scrutiny due to his questionable actions while at the NYFed .
As reported on Bloomberg and in the NYT , secret emails show that the NYFed under Geithner ’s command prohibited AIG from reporting that it was passing government bail - out funds directly to counterparties , including Goldman Sachs .
AIG had been negotiating with the banks , asking them to take as little as 40 cents on the dollar against bad CDOs they held .
AIG was the biggest insurer in the country and had provided $ 62 billion of credit default “ insurance ” to these banks .
The CDOs went bad and AIG could not cover claims .
It was forced into insolvency and the government came to the rescue , with $ 182 billion of bailout funds through last June .
By all rights , its counterparties should have lost big on their bad bets .
Apparently , Geithner arranged the bailout of AIG with full knowledge that it would pass the bailout funds directly to the banks .
Whether or not some protection should have been provided to the banks , it clearly was not good public policy to provide dollar - for - dollar protection to them .
If you are a favored Wall Street bank , no bet can go bad !
Geithner ’s relations with Wall Street bankers have always been incestuous , raising serious questions about his intentions .
Note that Geithner worked with then Treasury Secretary Paulson to broker the AIG deal .
Paulson , of course , had been the CEO of Goldman .
Geithner is the protégé of Clinton ’s Treasury Secretary Rubin , also from Goldman , and he got his job at the NYFed through the efforts of Pete Peterson .
In addition to the AIG deal , Geithner had the NYFed provide $ 29 billion of funding for J.P Morgan Chase ’s hostile takeover of Bear Stearns .
In the deal , the NYFed got $ 30 billion of questionable collateral .
Geithner hired Blackrock in a no-bid contract to manage these assets .
Blackrock is a spin-off of Pete Peterson ’s Blackstone Group , and was 49 % owned by Merrill Lynch , headed by John Thain ( another Goldman alum ) .
As head of the NYFed , Geithner ’s closest advisors were Thain , William McDonough ( Vice Chairman at Merrill ) , Gerald Corrigan ( Managing Director at Goldman ) , Jamie Dimon ( JP Morgan ) , and Richard Fuld of Lehman’s .
The head of the NYFed ’s Board of Directors was Stephen Friedman , former Goldman Sachs Chairman .
As Gary Weiss put it back in 2008 , “ Thus Geithner reports to a board that is composed of people who are not only under his purview but would also benefit from any potential bailouts .
The structure of the New York Fed ’s board bears more than a passing resemblance to that of the New York Stock Exchange in the bad old days , when member firms , regulated by the N.Y.S.E. , were heavily represented on its board ” .
The AIG deal seems to have been business as usual for Geithner .
According to Representative Darrell Issa , Republican of California , “ It appears that the New York Fed deliberately pressured AIG to restrict and delay the disclosure of important information to the S.E.C. ” .
Not only did Geithner want to keep this information from the public , but also from fellow regulators .
( Whoops , Geithner admitted he was never a regulator while at the NYFed . )
Indeed , at the time , Geithner refused to even tell Congress who the counterparties were - until overwhelming pressure required that he release the names .
This smells fishy because it is .
The Fed ’s justification for such secrecy was that it was trying to preserve the value of the taxpayer ’s investment in AIG .
( Vice President Donald Kohn explicitly made this argument before the Senate . )
But that is nonsense - there was no value to preserve .
This was just a give - away to protect Goldman and other counterparties .
Later when AIG ’s executives demanded that compensation limits be lifted so that they could get their bonuses , Geithner came to their rescue , arguing that contracts are contracts no matter how putrid they might appear .
We now know that the executives were demanding cash rather than stocks in their own firm because they expect the stocks will prove to be worthless - they are managing a firm that will never have any value and they know it .
This is something Geithner refuses to tell the public .
Remember , this is the same guy who “ forgot ” to pay his taxes .
Worse , he improperly claimed a tax deduction for a summer camp for his kids .
He is ethically challenged .
Should he be running the Treasury ?
More important than such blunders , however , is that Geithner ’s policies are not working .
As Republican Congressman Brady of Texas put it , “ Conservatives agree that , as point person , you ’ve failed .
Liberals are growing in that consensus as well .
Poll after poll shows the public has lost confidence in this president ’s ability to handle the economy .
For the sake of our jobs , will you step down from your post ? ” here Today ’s employment figures show that rather than a recovery , our economy is still hemorrhaging jobs at a scary pace .
While the payroll number was down “ only ” 85,000 jobs , the household survey was down 589,000 for December .
Over the past three months we have lost an average of 325,000 jobs .
And that is in spite of the fiscal stimulus as well as the trillions of bail - out funds provided to the financial sector .
We are at least 26 million jobs short .
Even if the job losses stopped , real recovery will require job creation on a massive scale .
The problem is that Congress , and the public , no longer has sufficient faith in the Administration to provide new funding - and the stimulus will soon run out .
Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon put it this way : “ We may have to sacrifice just two more jobs to get millions back for Americans . ”
Of course it is not quite that simple , but it is a first step .
We need an economic team that recognizes the following :
一昨日は駅前の喫茶店にて文字コードについてのインタビューをうけました。なんでも文字コードについて面白い読み物にしたいとのこと。X だと か02いくつだとか、訳の分からない数字やアルファベットが続くのに強い違和感を抱いている様子。うーん、いいなあ、ぼくも昔はそういうこと考えていたんだよなあ、正確さよりも面白さが大事だって。どこで間違っちゃったんだろうなあ。
で、乞われるまま にASCII からISO R 646、ISO 2022 か らISO /IEC 10646への流れ、そしてその中で日本が果たした役割、あるいはJIS
X 0208 がISO 2022に基づいた構造であること。もともとISO
2022は事前の二者間の合意を前提とした情報交換のために作られた符号化方法であり、合意のない情報交換や、コンピュータ内部の情報処理用としては向いてなかったこと、そしてこれがUCS≒Unicodeの登場を促すことになる――。
こういう流れを押さえると見えてくるんですが、文字コード規格というものは、符号化対象の文字の数とか種類を、より増やす形で進化してきた。そしてこれが大事なんですが、これをたった一言で表すと「国際化」という言葉に集約できる。つまり文字コード規格にとって「国際化」とは、本能のようなものだと言えるのではないか。そしてシフトJISは、この国際化ができない仕組みだったからこそ未来がなかった――。
……てなことを、数時間にわたってご説明申し上げたんですが、どうもライター氏の顔色はさえない。というより、話をすればするほど彼の顔はどんどん暗くなっていく。取材の最後、彼が聞いて曰く。
「 それで 、Unicodeになって、何か良いことってあるんですか？」
そりゃありますよ、シフトJISのように海外のウェブが化け化けになることもないし、JIS外字を意識しながら書かなくてすむし、良いことだらけじゃないですか。
「……いや あ、それは分かりますけど…… それだけですか？ 」
いや、まあ、それだけって言われればそれだけですけど。
「 じゃあ 、JIS X 0213で文字が増えて便利になったんですか？」
旧人名用漢字許容字体表の漢字が使えるようになりましたね。常用漢字の旧字体です。それからJIS
X 0208で漏れた、姓で使う漢字が入った。 SMAPファンは喜んでいると思いますよ。あとは鴎とか冒涜の「涜」など83改正で変えられた伝統的な字体が使えるようになった。
でも一番便利になったのは丸付き数字やハートマークでしょう。これが化けずに書けるようになった。
「 丸付き数 字 …… それだけですか？ 」
ま、それだけですけど。ええとですね、“誰もが満足する図書館を作るには、何冊蔵書すればいいか ” という問題をご存知ですか？ 具体的な数字は忘れちゃったんですけど、千冊かそこらあれば、９割以上の人は満足させられるんですよ。でも、あとの１割以下に満足してもらうには、じつに何十万冊も必要になるんです。漢字もこれと同じなんですよね（英単語などもそうですけど）。JIS
X 0213がやったのは、こうした「落ち穂拾い」なんです。どうしたって万人向けの漢字ばかりにはならないでしょう。
万人向けという意味では、常用漢字表は1,945文字を定義してます。でもこの1,945字ですら、ぼくはきっと全部は書けないと思います。ましてやJIS
X 0208は約7,000字もある。1990年代末に「文字が足りない」ってあちこちで言われてました。ぼく自身も編集者としてそう思ってた。それで出来たのがJIS
X 0213です。でも、約7,000字あった上の「足りない」ですからね、そうそう目に見えて多い訳がないんですよ。
それでも、こういうことは言えると思います。たしかに 草ナギ 川〈山竒〉君が存在する確率は、１学年に１人、いや学校に１人とかかもしれない。でもJISさえあれば在校生の名前を全部書けるというのは、大事なことなんだと――。
――てなことをご説明したのですが、ライター氏の顔色は曇ったまま帰途につかれたのでありました。ははは、さて、どんな原稿になるんだろうなあ。
しかしまあ、取材を受ける立場になって分かったことがあります。使いたい文字が使えるようになったり、文字が化けないことって、当たり前のことなんですよ。こういう当たり前のことに、普通人々は価値を見出しません。なんで文字コードについての原稿が売れないのか、大変よく分かったように思います。
※追記（2006.5.11 ）
文中、中線で消した部分は筆者の誤認でした。
草ナギ、冒涜の 「涜 」 や「鴎」の伝統字体はJIS X 0213以前にJIS X 0212に含まれます。
筆者 はWindows XPにおいて、これらの文字は簡単に入力できないと思っていましたが、事実はMS-IMEによる比較的簡単な操作で入力することができます。
ご指摘くださったttkさん、とおりすがりさんに感謝いたします。
