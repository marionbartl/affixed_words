The shrine is approached up a steep hill Up 240 steps , behind a padlocked wooden door , is a shrine holy to both Christian and Muslim believers .
It is not well known .
Wary of flocks of tourists , the people in Makedonski Brod , in south - western Macedonia , have kept its existence a well - guarded secret for years .
The aged building , marked only by a cross from outside , is decorated within by Christian icons , and portraits of both Jesus Christ and Muslim saints .
A stone - said to be from the tomb of a saint of the Bektashi order of Islam , sits right in the middle of the room .
The Bektashi Order is a branch of Sufi Islam which originated in Turkey and spread to parts of the Ottoman empire , including the Balkans .
For its adherents this building is their place of prayer - a " turbe " .
To Christians it is the Church of Saint Nikola .
But they have shared the space happily for years .
It is a remarkable feature in a region that has so recently been torn along ethnic and religious lines .
' Miracles happen ' Baba Ejup Rakipi , the local Bektashi leader , tells how , once a year , Christians and Muslims come together here on the day of Saint George known as " Gjurgjovden " .
On that day , after prayers , he says , believers sit around the same " table of love " .
They drink from the same glasses and eat with the same forks .
The walls bear images of both Christian and Muslim saints " There are souls who neither doubt , nor feel disgust towards other souls , because we are God 's creatures and cannot be divided , " he says .
The shrine in Makedonski Brod was first built as a church in the 14th Century , but was destroyed later during the Ottoman invasion , historians in Macedonia 's capital , Skopje say .
But the legend told in the area has it that the church was rebuilt as a sacred place in the 18th Century by a Muslim bey , in an effort to remove the curse from the house he was trying to build , that was always collapsing .
In the shrine of today , the Orthodox priest , Marko , says he often prays for the Muslim worshippers and " sometimes miracles happen " .
He tells the tale of a mute Muslim boy who had started to speak upon hearing an Orthodox prayer read for him .
" Unfortunately , I do not have any scientific evidence to back this , " he adds .
' We 're all the same '
As for sharing the space with believers of another faith , the priest has no problem .
" Our origin is from the same creator , therefore we are all the same in front of God no matter what religion we belong to - Muslim , Orthodox or Roman Catholic .
We are all the same and the God 's mercy is equal for all , " he says .
Historians in Macedonia 's capital , Skopje , say that the shrine at Makedonski Brod , although not known to many , it is not the only one in the country .
Ethnologist Elizabeta Koneska has studied the phenomenon for years .
She says such places of worship are common in small countries like Macedonia .
" For centuries , people who lived together , also prayed in common temples , " she says .
" Although the ritual was observed discretely , people respected it and tolerated each - other " .

Starting July 1 , Windows Client Software
Assurance customers will no longer have to buy a separate license to access their Windows operating system in a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure ( VDI ) environment , and virtual desktop access rights will be part of Software Assurance .
In the past , Microsoft required SA customers to pay an additional $ 23 per device annually for Windows Virtual Enterprise Centralized Desktop ( VECD ) , a device - based subscription license that was required for customers that run Windows desktops virtually from a data center .
Dai Vu , director of Virtualization Solutions Marketing at Microsoft , says the step was taken to address the confusion and complexity of virtual environment licensing .
" Customers feel that because they 've already paid for SA , having to pay again [ for VECD ] does n't make sense , " Vu said in an interview .
Customers will no doubt be thrilled that Microsoft is removing VECD from its price list and including virtual desktop access rights in SA , which gives customers the right to upgrade to new software versions released during the term of the contract with Microsoft and to spread payments over a three - year period .
However , VARs ' enthusiasm has been tempered by the fact that Microsoft 's SA requirement is still in place .
" I do n't see it being that huge of a change , " said Chris Ward , senior solutions architect at Greenpages , a solution provider in Kittery , Maine .
" The reality is that the main issue with VECD was the fact that you had to purchase SA to begin with .
Customers who do not have SA currently are in the same boat they are today . "
About half of Microsoft 's enterprise customers do not have SA on the desktop , so the change does them no good , notes Paul DeGroot , an analyst with Directions On Micosoft , Kirkland , Wash .
However , he says getting rid of VECD is a positive move on Microsoft 's part that will make things clearer for customers .
" It 's good that they eliminated VECD because they were in one sense penalizing customers for using VDI , " said DeGroot .
" SA lets me run up to four virtual machines on my desktop .
But if I wanted to run them over the network , I had to pay extra .
So while I owned a virtualization right , if I exercised that right in a particular way , I paid extra . "
Microsoft is also broadening roaming rights for Windows SA customers , allowing them to access virtualized Windows desktop and Microsoft Office applications when they 're outside the corporate firewall .
For $ 100 per device annually , customers can buy the new Virtual Desktop Access license ( VDA ) and use devices such as home PC and kiosks that are n't covered by SA .
While today 's moves will help customers , solution providers say Microsoft 's insistence on pushing SA is one of the biggest obstacles to adoption of its virtualization technologies .
SA has long been a roadblock to Microsoft virtualization deals , and it's also required for Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack ( MDOP ) , which includes desktop and application virtualization and a host of other tools .
Ward has seen customers walk away from virtualization deals over the SA requirement and he expects this to remain an issue .
" If I 'm a customer who buys PCs from HP with the OEM license , then I must upgrade that OEM license to a full license and add SA to it .
That is the bulk of the cost involved to these customers , " said Ward .
" Saving the additional $ 23 per device / per year [ from VECD ] will help a little , but the ROI is still way off in most cases . "
F1 ’s ever - tighter technical regulations have n’t stopped the cars getting even quicker in 2010 .
This year ’s cars are lapping on a par with the 2004 machines which set many of the lap records at the tracks on this year ’s calendar .
That ’s despite the cars of 2004 having much freer aerodynamic regulations , softer rubber because of the Bridgestone - Michelin tyre war , and two more cylinders in their engines .
This graph shows how lap times have changed over the past 14 years at two circuits whose configurations have remained largely the same : Albert Park in Australia and Sepang in Malaysia .
I ’ve plotted the fastest time set by an F1 car at a practice session , qualifying or in the race in each of their visits since 1996 :
Sebastian Vettel ’s pole position time at Melbourne this year was two tenths of a second faster than 2004 race lap record set by Michael Schumacher .
The rain - hit qualifying session at Sepang meant we did n’t see the full potential of this year ’s cars but it ’s likely we would have seen them within range of the 2004 lap times .
However many of the 2004 race lap records are likely to remain unchanged as the refuelling ban means cars are now much slower during the races – by around four to five seconds per lap .
Controlling F1 speeds
We ’ve seen the FIA repeatedly intervene to slow cars in past seasons .
After 2004 tyre stops were banned to force teams to used harder tyre compounds .
That rule only lasted until the end of 2005 but the switch to V8 engines in 2006 slowed the cars even further and the introduction of a single tyre supplier in 2007 also helped slow the cars .
Last year wings were subject to new , tighter restrictions which slowed the cars down , but the return of slick tyres compensated for that .
Will the FIA act to slow the cars down again ?
We ’ve already learned that double diffusers will be banned for 2011 , which will slow the cars to some extent .
But will the FIA feel the need to go further ?
We ’ve also heard rumours the FIA is considering allowing competition between tyre manufacturers once again .
That would cause lap times to plummet .
Look at how the lap times fell on the chart above in 1997 and 2001 , both seasons when the sport went from having one tyre supplier to two .
The FIA ’s justification for slowing the cars down has been the need to restrict cornering speeds for safety reasons .
If a tyre war were allowed in the future , surely they would choose some other means of restricting car performance .
Do you think it ’s necessary to keep limiting F1 car speeds ?
If so , how should it be done ?
More restrictions on engine performance ?
Smaller wings ?
Heavier cars ?
Have your say in the comments .

Mystery of the constantly - draining hot tub solved as elephant is caught on camera DRINKING it
Staff at the safari park were baffled by the mystery of the disappearing whirlpool bath .
Every morning they filled the open - air bath outside one of the guest lodges , and every night it was empty - even though no leak could be found .
It was only when a guest heard a mighty slurping and went outside with a camera that the culprit was discovered in the shape of Troublesome the elephant .
I 'm sorry , did you want some ?
Troublesome the elephant is caught on camera sneaking a drink from a whirlpool bath at a South African resort
The elephant - nicknamed ' Troublesome ' - is well known to rangers at the reserve for her inquisitive nature .
But no - one realised she was behind the ' leak ' at the Jacuzzi - style hot tub outside one of the £ 400 - a- night lodges .
Susan Potgieter , owner of Etali Safari Lodge , in North West Province , South Africa , said elephants could drink more than 200 litres of water a day so drinking a whole whirlpool bath was no problem .
She said : ' When I first saw the photograph of her drinking I could n't believe it .
And then it dawned on me of course an elephant was drinking it .
' It was something of a relief because we had been trying to work out why the pool had been draining so quickly for weeks but could n't find a leak anywhere .
Another view of the Etali Safari Lodge , where Troublesome is well known to rangers for her inquisitive nature
' When it was empty in the morning we first called a plumber , but they could not work out why it was draining either .
' Troublesome was caught in the act by a guest at the lodge who just came outside to have some tea on the decking .
' They were quite surprised to see an elephant taking a drink of her own too , and quickly grabbed a camera .
' We 've seen this elephant a lot before and by the lodge , the rangers call her ' Troublesome ' not because she causes trouble but because she comes so close to their vehicles . '
Ms Potgieter said Troublesome probably preferred the water of the whirlpool bath because it was clean .
She said : ' Now that we know what was going on we have tried to provide her an alternative source of water .
But sometimes it 's hard to get an elephant to change her ways .

Avatar director PASADENA , Calif. ( AP ) director James Cameron is helping to build a high - resolution 3 - D camera on the next - generation Mars rover .
The camera will be mounted atop Curiosity , the next rover mission to Mars set for launch next year .
Pasadena 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory scaled back its plans in 2007 to mount a 3 - D camera atop Curiosity because the upcoming flagship mission to Mars was consistently over budget and behind schedule .
But Cameron lobbied NASA administrator Charles Bolden for inclusion of the 3 - D camera during a January meeting , saying a rover with a better set of eyes will help the public connect with the mission .
Bolden was convinced .
San Diego - based Malin Space Science Systems is now building the 3 - D mast camera with Cameron listed as co-investigator .

Coins and notes will be used in less than half of all transactions within five years after payments made by cash slumped from 73 % to 59 % over the past decade , according to new research .
The Payments Council says cash is " king no more " after a study of payment trends between 1999 and 2009 found debit card spending was now the most popular - quadrupling to £ 264bn last year .
The council predicted in 1999 that just over one billion cheques would be used by individuals in 2009 , but the figure in fact fell to 577m .
Cheques are proposed to be phased out completely by October 2018 , although the council said even if no action was taken , the volumes would more than halve to just 248 m in that time , making up just 0.8 % of all personal payments made .
We 've extracted the data from the PDF which shows exactly how much we spent in different areas - and how much of it was in cash .

Data summary
Weisz will be directed by her fiancee Darren Aronofsky , the man behind The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream .
This is the second time the pair has worked together , with the first being the 2006 film The Fountain .
The script had previously been rumored as a Spielberg produced HBO movie , but that is clearly no longer the case .
The script was written by Noah Oppenheim , who works in reality TV at production company Reveille .
The story is described as follows : Jackie , written over period of nights and weekends by Oppenheim , catalogs the four days between JFK ’s assassination and his burial , showing the beloved Jackie at both her most vulnerable and her most graceful .
If that description sounded as boring to you as it did to me then here are some pictures of Rachel Weisz to snap you back to consciousness .
Update :
The girl above is n’t actually Weisz ( Damn you and your lies Google Images ) but I ’m going to allow her to stay because she is smart , funny and an overall pleasure to converse with .
Do you eat , in two hours or less , an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would consume in the same time , and under similar circumstances ?
Have you been eating until uncomfortably full , and more rapidly than most people would , at least once a week , for three months , minimum ?
Do you feel disgusted , depressed or guilty once you stop ?
If you answer yes to the above , you fit the criteria for a mental illness being proposed for official inclusion in psychiatry 's manual of mental dysfunctions .
Binge eating disorder , or BED - a condition that has lingered in the appendix of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , or DSM , since the last edition was published nearly 20 years ago - would be formally promoted to the main manual under proposed revisions for the next edition of DSM .
Doctors and support groups who work with people with eating disorders say it would legitimize what they see every day - an increase in people , notably women over 40 and , increasingly , men , who have lost control over their eating .
But critics are questioning the urgency of making binge eating a distinct , free - standing diagnosis alongside bulimia and anorexia nervosa .
They wonder how reliably doctors who are not experts in eating disorders can distinguish between someone who binges for psychiatric reasons and someone who merely overeats .
Skeptics worry that , with the nation in the grips of an " epidemic " of obesity , thousands of people struggling with weight issues could suddenly be tagged " disordered " and potentially treated with Prozac - like antidepressants and other drugs .
Some legal experts in the U.S. are warning that , if an overweight person is fired from a job they could claim they were fired for having a mental illness - BED .
" Why should people eating too much be considered pathological ? " says Stuart Kirk , professor of social welfare at the School of Public Affairs at the University of California , Los Angeles , and co-author of Making Us Crazy ; DSM : The Psychiatric Bible and the Creation of Mental Disorders .
" They 're saying , ' We 're arbitrarily going to put the marker here :
If you do it this much , and you feel this bad , and you do it for two weeks or three months . . .'
They 've already made the assumption that wherever they draw that line , that that 's going to be considered the brain disease , " Kirk says .
" That will expand the market for drug companies . "
Dr. Valerie Taylor agrees that , " absolutely , " there is a risk of over - diagnosing binge eating .
" But it 's not a new diagnosis .
It 's been out there for a while , and everybody with obesity has n't been diagnosed with binge eating disorder , " says Taylor , mental health lead for the Canadian Obesity Network and assistant professor in psychiatry and behavioural neurosciences at McMaster University in Hamilton .
" So if it moves from the provisional category to one that 's actually accepted , it 's not going to suddenly tweak people to think , ' Oh , if you 're obese , you have binge eating disorder . "
Taylor says binge eating disorder is a true clinical entity , and that it 's not simply eating too much at Thanksgiving .
Rather , the binges occur weekly for at least three months , and people " simply ca n't stop .
They really feel there is something else driving their eating . "
" And if you talk to somebody who has weight difficulties but who does n't have binge eating disorder , if you ask them some of the questions required to make the diagnosis - do you really feel like this is beyond your control ?
Do you really feel angry , upset , distressed afterwards ?
- they can't relate to that .
That 's not them . "
Obesity is n't synonymous with binge eating disorder , she says , nor is binge eating disorder synonymous with obesity .
Legitimizing the illness , she says , will help make it easier to get funding for research and treatment .
Cognitive therapy and other interventions can help people normalize their eating , she says , " so that you never get to the point where you 're starving . "
For Robin Moore , the binge rituals would begin mid-afternoon and continue until late in the night .
The 45 - year - old Toronto woman has struggled with her weight since she was 10 .
She used food not just to deal with emotional pain , but with any emotion , good or bad .
When she gave up smoking in her 20s , she gained more than 100 pounds in three years .
" I was just binging constantly .
I would eat enormous amounts of food . "
She would eat normally when she was around other people .
But when she was alone in her apartment , all bets were off .
" There was no hitting the pause button . "
Her weight has ranged from 153 to 303 pounds .
" The agony of being an overweight or obese female in this society is even more damaging , and the self - shame - it was just horrendous . "
She is now in recovery after years of help that started in 1998 at Sheena 's Place , a Toronto support centre for people with eating disorders .
" Until I dealt with what was going on in my mind I was not going to be able to step into recovery . "
Now a certified life coach , she works with people struggling with BED and weight issues .
Anne Elliott , program director at Sheena 's Place , says some people restrict their food intake so much during the day that , by the time they start eating , they 're starving and they can't stop .
Others do n't restrict during the day , but then eat everything in sight at midnight , she says .
Adding binge eating to the manual of mental illness would validate " that this is real , it 's not a figment of people 's imagination , it 's not a ' discipline ' problem - ' just stop eating and get on another diet , ' " adds Julie Notto , program co-ordinator .
" We glamorize thinness in our culture , that 's what we value .
No one wants to talk about the fact that , at midnight , they 're so overwhelmed that they eat everything in their fridge .
No one wants to talk about that . "
But Dr. Allen Frances says that a " fair proportion of the population " cycles between restricting and binging .
" But that something happens in life does not make it a mental disorder , " says the former chairman of the department of psychiatry at Duke University in Durham , N.C. A nationwide U.S. survey by Harvard - affiliated McLean Hospital published in 2007 found binge eating disorder afflicts 3.5 per cent of women and two per cent of men at some point in their lives , making it more common than bulimia or anorexia .
But Frances predicts the diagnosis will spread rapidly once it graduates to the main text of the DSM .

First the shell begins to crack .
Then there 's a flurry of activity as the tiny creature curled up inside the egg breaks a hole in the shell .
Next , a scaly , pink foot emerges , flailing wildly , before - bit by bit - the miniature damp bundle bursts forth from the broken shell , making its appearance in the world for the very first time .
These extraordinary sets of pictures show the young of four different species hatching from their eggs .
Ostrich ...
Phew :
It 's not like breaking into a chocolate Easter egg - it's a lot tougher and requires a sheer muscle power
... and after a short rest , it 's off to explore .
After all , no good having one 's head in the sand
Titled ' Escape Into Life ' , the series records the first moments of a newborn chick , the young of the African penguin ( whose eggs are laid in caves padded with feathers and bits of wood ) , the ostrich ( which breaks the shell not by pecking , but expanding the muscles of its throat ) and , finally , the red footed tortoise ( seen here popping out of its shell with mouth wide open as if in astonished rapture at what it can see ) .
The work of husband and wife team Heidi and Hans - Juergen Koch from Germany ( who have specialised in animal photography for the past 20 years ) they are the result of many days and weeks of patient observation - and provide a fascinating pictoral record of four creatures arriving into the world .
African penguin ...
Cracked it :
My approach is to peck the shell into tiny pieces - from the inside out
... so that I 'm soon ready for action in anyone 's book .
Penguin books , even
Tortoise ...
Escape claws : 150 days after the egg is laid , a scaly red foot emerges
... and after being buried in the sand for so long , it 's clearly turtley exciting to be here !
Chicken ...

カードローン会社が一番喜ぶのは、定期的な収入のある20代の独身会社員です。
というのも、{独身であれば稼いだお金を勝手に使用することができますし、
利用先も多種多様なため、キャッシングを継続して利用してもらえることが予想できるからです。
次点で40代〜50代の男性が有利で、そこそこの役職に属すのであれば、返すだけの収入はあるはずだとと判断されるからです
とはいえ、40を過ぎた男性はだいたいが既婚者になりますよね。
ですので、住宅ローンなどの返済に追われ、また子供がいるのであれば教育費も必要ですので、
キャッシングの返済が後手後手になるのではないか、と判断されてしまいます。
ですから、カードローン審査年齢は、20代〜50代の男性、特に20歳から30歳の独身男性{となります|ということがいえるでしょう。

IT is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife .
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .
" My dear Mr. Bennet , '' said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? ''
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not .
Will the fate of Interstate 80 become a metaphor for America ?
If it does , this country ’s painful decline will be self - inflicted .
Not that there is anything wrong with I - 80 at the moment .
It runs for 311 bucolic miles through the middle of Pennsylvania and is in generally good shape .
In order to maintain the road and generate funds for other projects in the state , Pennsylvania ’s legislature had approved a plan to place tolls on the road .
The $ 472 million that would have been collected was supposed to cover about half what the state intended to spend on highways and public transportation .
The federal government turned down the state ’s proposal , however .
Even though this was the third time Washington rejected the idea of tolls , Pennsylvania ’s lawmakers apparently had no Plan B .
Now the governor will convene a special session of the legislature on May 4 to consider how to raise the money required or to decide where to cut .
While there are several different options , the most obvious one probably wo n’t get the serious discussion it deserves .
Increasing the state fuel tax – which now stands at 32.3 cents per gallon – by about seven cents a gallon could fill the gap .
The people using Pennsylvania ’s roads would pay the tax and it would cost nothing more to collect .
Gasoline prices have risen 80 cents a gallon since a year ago , and yet the republic still stands , so the burden is bearable .
In the current political climate , however , raising taxes is outside the realm of rational discussion .
Those who are the loudest constantly demand lower taxes and less government and their mantra is reported as though it were a universally held belief .
The debate in the state legislature will therefore probably veer in the direction of which programs to cut and how much of I - 80 ’s maintenance to defer .
But deferring fixes will just add to the pain later ; the total cost for state infrastructure repairs now equals $ 14 billion .
One alternative that will be considered is leasing the freeway to private companies .
That is a popular approach to many public functions because it feeds into the notion that the government can do nothing right and the private sector can run anything well .
The maligned Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission , under investigation by the state ’s attorney general and the FBI , seems to be a talking point in favor of that argument .
One strong incentive for privatization has nothing to do with the supposed superiority of the private sector .
The corporations that profit from operating what was formerly a government program often recycle a portion of the proceeds to the elections campaigns of the politicians that made it possible .
And the result has little to do with the public interest or efficiency .
Roads run by a private company will be operated to maximize the profits of the company leasing them .
And as the financial services and banking industries have demonstrated , the marketplace does not always unfailingly allocate resources in the most effective manner .
At times the antitax sentiment seems exaggerated .
A recent New York Times / CBS poll found that 6 out of 10 Republicans and independents and two - thirds of Democrats say the income tax they pay is “ fair . ”
Even a majority of those who support the “ tea party ” movement , a group whose very name suggests deep anger over taxation , believe that what they had to pay is fair .
But enough voters buy into the “ all taxes are evil ” idea and care about little else that they can sway elections .
Since 65 percent of the petroleum used in this country is imported , making energy more expensive while supporting the infrastructure that transportation requires makes sense .
A gas tax does not require a new government bureaucracy or a rapacious corporate entity .
And it would not cause more energy to be wasted by the people waiting in lines to pay tolls .
Pennsylvania ’s problem with funding roads is not unique to the state or only a problem of transportation .
A whole host of government services , including the public education system that is crucial to American competitiveness in today ’s global economy , are being slowly starved .
Our nation ’s decline is not assured .
But to get it back on track , Americans must be willing to show a greater appreciation for the things government rightly does on our behalf and have an honest discussion about how to pay for them .
Dennis Jett , a former US ambassador to Mozambique and Peru , is a professor of international affairs at Penn State ’s School of International Affairs .

It 's not just that they 're lower in April 2010 than they were in April 2009 .

What 's going on ?
Is Beck turning socialist , spreading his viewers around with other stations ?
Or were his viewers out planting survival seeds to prepare for ObamaTyranny ?
Or maybe they were raising farm animals to pay for doctors once the LowdenCare revolution comes to pass ?
From the files of “ The Republican Party is definitely veering far , far to the right ” comes the story of Lora Rae Anderson , the outgoing Chair of the Wisconsin College Republicans .
In a press release issued on April 27 , Anderson outlined her discontent with the direction of the Republican Party , noting that in 2008 , the Republican Party was happy to announce that they had passed their “ most conservative platform ever . ”
Anderson went on to note :
This might be appealing to current members of the Republican Party but is not appealing to the vast majority of moderate Americans .
“ The Republican Party is alienating a younger , more progressive generation through its new ‘ conservative platform ’ which ignores issues such as gay marriage .
Marriage , at least as the law would put it , is a civil right .
Allowing those people who want to get married to be married is consistent with the Republican Party ’s ‘ government hand ’s off ’ platform .
This is an area where most College Republicans agree , but for one reason or another , stay quiet and do n’t stand up to the older members of our party ” said Anderson .
In her press release , Anderson also indicated she would not be renewing her membership in the Republican Party of Wisconsin for 2010 , citing an incident in which the Eau Claire County Republican Chairman , Brian Westrate , used “ cultural insults and racial slurs ” during an argument on Facebook with some of Anderson ’s liberal friends .
“ Racial slurs obviously do n’t sit well with me , but when somebody knowingly racially slurs my friends ; I am personally insulted .
While being in my position , I did n’t speak out about Westrate ’s clear disregard for decency .
That decision was wrong , I should have stood up for the parties insulted .
Needless to say , I will not be renewing my membership to the Eau Claire County Republican Party or the Republican Party of Wisconsin for the year 2010 . ”
I ca n’t help but think that as the Republican Party continues its march towards far - right extremism , more and more rational , responsible Republicans will eschew the politics of “ negativity and no ” in favor of a more traditional ( and rational ) definition of conservatism .
The fact is , the Republican Party cannot continue to appeal to the lowest common denominator in politics if it hopes to continue to be more than a regional party , and what ’s more , it ca n’t afford to lose moderate young Republicans like Lora Rae Anderson .
EDIT : As The Chief notes , “ [ i ] f Lora Rae Anderson wanted a career in GOP politics — and as state CR chair she was certainly in the fast lane to reach that goal — this is a career suicide note .
It ’s the kind of principled stand only a young person could accomplish .
This type of act took guts , independent of political beliefs or party affiliation . ”
Truly , Lora Rae Anderson ’s actions took guys , and she should be commended for standing up for what she believed to be right .
Carlos Tevez and Gary Neville , the two central figures in the acrimony that has surrounded this season 's Manchester derbies , will be under police orders not to do anything that could incite crowd trouble when City and United renew hostilities tomorrow .
Greater Manchester police , planning one of the biggest football operations of the season , are to speak to both clubs to emphasise the importance of the two sets of players behaving responsibly rather than fuelling existing tensions .
The police are anxious about the way the players celebrate goals , and it will be made clear to the two clubs that this should not involve deliberately goading opposition supporters .
When United beat City at Old Trafford with an injury - time goal in September the United captain Neville , an unused substitute , ran along the touchline to celebrate provocatively in front of the away end .
The Football Association subsequently wrote to Neville to warn him about his future conduct but the former England player was involved in more controversy in the first leg of the Carling Cup semi-final in January , when he flashed his middle finger at Tevez after his former team - mate had scored from the penalty spot .
Tevez had gestured towards Neville after running to celebrate in front of Sir Alex Ferguson 's dugout and , still nursing a grievance from the way he perceives he was treated at Old Trafford , cupping his ears towards United 's officials in the directors ' box .
The striker subsequently called Neville a " boot - licker " and a " moron " in an interview on Argentinian radio , an outburst that led the police to contact his club because of their concerns that he was fuelling the potential for trouble .
Eighteen people were arrested before , during and after that encounter at Eastlands and police confiscated items including darts and golf balls from United 's fans .
Other objects were thrown on to the pitch by both sets of supporters , including a cigarette lighter that struck the United left - back Patrice Evra .
Roberto Mancini , the City manager , has been warned and fined £ 20,000 , suspended until the end of the 2011 - 12 season , after admitting misconduct following his touchline clash with David Moyes during his side 's home defeat to Everton last month .

Google 's introduction of Java support for Google App Engine ( GAE ) added a low maintenance hosting solution to the world .
Despite limitations of the Java support in AppEngine , it still allows to the majority of existing JVM libraries - and that includes many JVM languages .
Clojure is a JVM based language inspired by LISP , that 's already being used in productions systems , eg. FlightCaster .
Clojure has many strengths , some come from its LISP ancestry like macros for metaprogramming , others shine through their tight and seamless integration , such as the powerful concurrency mechanisms ( Software Transactional Memory , Agents , etc ) or persistent data structures .
( If these latter terms are unfamiliar , this interview with Clojure creator Rich Hickey will be helpful ) .
But how do Clojure and GAE get along ?
The Deadline is a newly released project task management system , built using Clojure on GAE by german company freiheit.com .
InfoQ talked to Stefan Richter , of freiheit.com , about the product , the reason for choosing Clojure - and how Clojure fares with one hand tied behind its back due to the restrictions of threading on GAE .
InfoQ : How and where do you use Clojure ?
We are using Clojure for our first Internet - Startup " The Deadline " .
My company freiheit.com technologies is specialized in developing large - scale internet systems as a contractor for other companies .
We have been using Java for more than 10 years .
Clojure is powerful .
The programs are beautiful and concise .
Productivity is very high .
And :
It 's fun !
As Paul Graham once said : " Lisp 's power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors do n't get it " .
We hope we can convice new customers to choose Clojure , too .
InfoQ : Have you used Clojure on client projects yet ?
No , not Clojure by now .
But we 've built systems in Common Lisp .
One is an eCommerce system and the other one is a system that does Information Extraction by using Natural Language Parsing and Machine Learning on large data - sets .
InfoQ : What 's your experience with Clojure on GAE ?
Clojure works out - of - the - box with Google AppEngine ( GAE ) .
You ca n't use the concurrency features , but actually you do n't need them .
GAE is all about creating stateless applications , that can handle one request in a single thread / process .
The first thing we had to find out was how to do lisp - like interactive programming with the GAE development environment and Emacs / Slime .
If you are used to this , you do n't want to miss that .
We published a howto in our Blog http://www.hackers-with-attitude.com.
The article : " Interactive Programming with Clojure , Compojure , Google App Engine and Emacs " .
InfoQ : What do you like about Clojure ?
For me , functional programming is all about having simple datastructures and applying powerful functional abstractions on them .
This is totally different to OOP languages , where you have complex data structures with hierarchical / networked dependencies and encapsulated functionality .
It is all about managing state .
At least in the way the Java platform implements OOP .
Together with this , the key features of Clojure for me are actually :
I. - immutable , very simple datastructures based on hashtables / maps
II . - the lisp syntax with all the parenthesis ( code = data )
III . - the macro system .
This make Clojure really powerful .
You pass simple data to functions , the functions return new data or new functions that you can pass on .
You have small , but powerful building blocks .
And the language makes folding , transforming and filtering of data very easy .
InfoQ : There 's no RDBMS on GAE .
How do you access storage on GAE ?
The datastore is a schema - free , distributed key - value store .
Schema - free does n't mean that you do n't need a schema , but that you need to maintain it on the application side .
We implemented our own DSL to declare a schema and to automatically generate all the code to access ( insert , update , delete ) and query the datastore .
This is one of our above mentioned " powerful functional abstraction " that operates on simple Clojure datastructures .
You do n't have to handle any datastore entity types inside the Clojure code .
You just declare what you need and the macro system generates the corresponding code for you .
Using the datastore is totally different from using a relational database ( RDB ) .
You have to think different .
But the key - value model matches very well with the Clojure datastructures .
And much better than the object - relational mapping approach .
And even when you send out data as an AJAX response , there is not much transformation needed .
So it is simple and traceable from end - to - end .
InfoQ : What do you use for the HTML frontend ?
We are using Compojure with clj - html .
I was used to this approach because I used Hunchentoot ( a Common Lisp Web - Server from Edi Weitz ) and CL - WHO ( a DSL to generate HTML from Edi , too ) a lot .
For me , this is the way to write modern web - apps : Having a specific DSL to generate HTML , so that you can mix it with your application code .
You are still separating the presentation from the application logic .
You can create components .
It is really powerful , so you do n't need an extra template framework in a lisp - like language .
InfoQ : Have you run into any problems with Clojure on GAE ?
AppEngine works .
We only had minor problems .
AppEngine differs from other Cloud - Computing environments , that you are not managing your own array of virtual servers .
You just write your app using the AppEngine SDK .
Deployment is really easy and the application is automatically distributed globally to the Google data - centers .
When somebody tries to access your app , it is instantiated in a data - center close to this user .
You get as many " machines " as you want .
Or as you can pay for . :)
In the beginning , dynamic languages ( jRuby , Clojure etc. ) on the JVM were much slower than native Java apps .
It is better now , but the App " Warmup " ( the first instantiation ) is still a bit slow .
And it seems like when Google deploys a new API version , that the older API version gets slower .
So we update quickly to new API version .
One thing would be nice : Data - Processing with MapReduce .
It would be cool if we could use our app data in MapReduce - Tasks .
But in general we are very happy with it .
InfoQ : How do the GAE restrictions impact you ?
The restrictions you have are needed for large - scale systems :
You should not start your own threads in a request .
You have a time - limit for each request .
You should n't expect to have a count - Function when you possibly have hundreds of millions or billions of records in your datastore etc .
You need other mechanics then .
So you have to do what you would have to keep in mind anyway , when writing an app for a global audience .
InfoQ : So what is your product , TheDeadline ?
We worked with our own agile software development method for almost 10 years .
We are very good organized without being bureaucratic .
We have lots of experience in this area and we built a complete toolchain for agile software projects for ourselves .
Now , we are rebuilding this toolchain for cloud - computing and offer it to a larger audience as a service .
And we only offer products , that we are using in our own projects , ranging from 1 - 2 developers over the average of 3 - 5 developers and up to 20 developers .
The first service is The Deadline , an easy - to - use Todo - Manager that acts like a personal human assistant .
The system keeps you updated on all important tasks , without annoying you .
And we implemented a novel way on how to share with and delegate todos to a larger group of users .
So this first product is not only aimed at developers , but to all types of knowledge workers and small businesses .
The " Fortune 5.000.000 " and not the " Fortune 500 " . :)
The public beta of The Deadline starts now .
In the next step we will publish Mobile Clients for the iPhone , iPad and Android and a Google Apps integration .
InfoQ : You mentioned AI concepts you used for TheDeadline .
What is that about ?
We are using AI techniques that are also used in Game - AI .
So what we are trying to do is to build an AI - system that behaves like a really good intelligent , autonomous NPC ( Non-player Character ) .
We built for example a rule - based Expertsystem - Shell in Clojure , comparable to CLIPS , LISA or OPS5 .
These rules are at the core of the AI - behavior .
Other techniques are Goal - oriented Action - Planning and Bayesian Learning .
We are trying to learn from the user - behavior , but here we are still in the beginnings .
It is like trying to mimic the behavior of the best project manager or project assistant that you ever met .
Our goal is to eliminate all human project management work on this planet .
( Not the " project manager " , but the " project management work " ) .
Most project management stuff is about finding the right tasks and delegate them to the right people and then monitoring the progress , reminding people , re-planning things etc .
A lot of this can be done by a machine , that interacts friendly with a human .
Just put all the todos into TheDeadline .
The machine then takes care for keeping everybody up - to - date and raises exceptions and questions , before something can go wrong .
So you can focus on the real work .
To see what 's possible with GAE and the various Clojure technologies mentioned in this article , check out The Deadline - it 's free of charge .
The tool offers a modern web UI , complete with keyboard shortcuts for most interactions .
A Twitter - style , inline " @name " notation can be used to assign tasks , as well as a " #tag " notation for grouping tasks using a loose set of tags .
For another look at the technology behind this , see slides from a talk Stefan gave on The Deadline earlier this year .
Democrats have found a new weapon in their assault on potential Republican Senate candidate Dino Rossi .
The investment firm in which Rossi is a minority partner owes $ 20,000 in unpaid taxes on a business property in Everett , Washington , according to tax records from Snohomish County .
Coast Equity Partners did not pay taxes , due in October 2009 , on a multi- unit property that was rented to a motor sports dealership .
( The sum includes roughly $ 18,000 in taxes and $ 2,500 in fees and penalties for delinquency . )
Speculation has mounted that Rossi will challenge Democratic Sen. Patty Murray this year .
If he did , he would likely pose a serious threat .
A former state senator , Rossi has run for governor twice and lost narrowly twice .
In 2004 , he initially won the title of governor - elect before losing by 129 votes in a hand recount .
He will have to decide by June 11 , the state 's filing deadline , whether or not to run .
He would enter the field with good name recognition in a year that 's expected to be tough on Democrats .
The tax information was uncovered by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , which sent researchers to Snohomish to delve into Rossi 's business records .
It speaks to the DSCC 's aggressive tack , specifically when it comes to opposition research , in the 2010 election cycle , as the committee seeks to fiercely protect vulnerable Democratic - held seats .
Rossi has n't even announced his candidacy , and the DSCC has set up a website , dirtydealsdinoforsenate.com , dedicated to portraying him as a scummy guy prone to questionable business deals .
Sending opposition researchers to dig up records on an unannounced Senate candidate , months before the filing deadline , qualifies as an aggressive move .
It 's the type of legwork that goes into building dossiers on major potential presidential candidates , like Romney , Huckabee and McCain in 2008 .
Indiana Republican Dan Coats received similar treatmen t from the DSCC in February .
As soon as Coats announced a bid for the seat being vacated by Democratic Sen .
Evan Bayh , Democrats pounced on Coats with research on his status as a registered lobbyist who was registered to vote in Virginia .
Democrats threw out suggestions that Coats had lobbied for PhRMA and had lobbying ties to foreign interests .
The unpaid taxes in Washington may have nothing to do with Rossi , individually .
" It definitely is nothing Dino is involved in , " Coast Equity Partners CEO Tom Hoban told the Everett Herald , which broke the news at midnight , Thursday morning .
Hoban said the unpaid taxes were just being brought to his attention , and that Coast Equity would contact investment partners to discuss it .
Rossi joined the Seattle - based firm as a minority partner in December 2008 .
Regardless of Rossi's connection to the taxes , the tidbit of research will undoubtedly be used by Democrats , as it fits into the narrative they are seeking to build about him as a businessman , in an attempt to damage and embarrass him as mulls whether or not to run .

The NHL season has a few games left , but there are a couple of tables we can update already .
The Thrashers will miss the post - season for the 9th time in 10 opportunities .
This means the Thrashers will extend to 10 seasons their streak with no playoff wins .
By missing the post - season the Thrashers cannot possibly win a playoff series .
No NHL team has ever won a playoff series in Atlanta - - never , ever - - really !
Combining the Thrashers ( 10 ) and Flames ( 8 ) that pushes the record for NHL playoff futility to a mind boggling 18 seasons in this market .
Consider this fact for a moment , if the Atlanta playoff drought was a person , it would already have a driver 's license and be old enough to vote in elections and is just three years shy of being able to drink legally .
Those 18 seasons represent a lost generation of fans -- an entire age cohort with literally nothing to cheer for in the post - season .
Three current NHL markets have never witnessed a playoff series victory -- Atlanta , Phoenix , Nashville and Columbus .
Two of those markets qualified and could earn their first series victory this spring .
Longest drought without a NHL playoff win

( Santa Barbara , Calif . ) --
The discovery of nine new planets challenges the reigning theory of the formation of planets , according to new observations by astronomers .
Two of the astronomers involved in the discoveries are based at the UC Santa Barbara - affiliated Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network ( LCOGT ) , based in Goleta , Calif . , near UCSB .
Unlike the planets in our solar system , two of the newly discovered planets are orbiting in the opposite direction to the rotation of their host star .
This , along with a recent study of other exoplanets , upsets the primary theory of how planets are formed .
There is a preponderance of these planets with their orbital spin going opposite to that of their parent star .
They are called exoplanets because they are located outside of our solar system .
These and other related discoveries are being presented at the UK National Astronomy Meeting in Glasgow , Scotland , this week .
This is the first public mention of the new planets and the research will be described in upcoming scientific journal articles .
" Planet evolution theorists now have to explain how so many planets came to be orbiting like this , " said Tim Lister , a project scientist at LCOGT .
Lister leads a major part of the observational campaigns along with Rachel Street of LCOGT , Andrew Cameron of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland , and Didier Queloz , of the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland .
Data from LCOGT was instrumental in confirming the new planet discoveries .
By adding these nine new " transiting " planets , the number of known transiting planets has grown from 71 to 80 .
A transit occurs when a celestial body passes in front of its host star and blocks some of the star 's light .
This type of eclipse causes a small drop in the apparent brightness of the star and enables the planet 's mass , diameter , density , and temperature to be deduced .
After the initial detection of the new exoplanets by the Wide Angle Search for Planets ( WASP ) , the team of astronomers combined data from LCOGT 's 2.0 - meter Faulkes Telescopes in Hawaii and Australia with follow - up from other telescopes to confirm the discoveries and characterize the planets .
The planets are revolving around nearby stars in our galaxy within 1,000 light years of our sun .
Their stars are located in the constellations Pegasus , Virgo , Pisces , and Andromeda in the northern hemisphere , and Eridanus , Hydra , Cetus , and Phoenix in the southern hemisphere .
The nine planets are called " Hot Jupiters . "
These planets are giant gas planets that orbit close to their star .
In the 15 years since the first Hot Jupiters were discovered , their origin has been a puzzle .
Because they are both large and close , they are easier to detect from their gravitational effect on their stars , and more likely to transit the disk of the star .
Most of the first exoplanets discovered were of this type .
The cores of giant planets are thought to form from a mix of rock and ice particles found only in the cold outer reaches of planetary systems .
Hot Jupiters , therefore , must form far from their star and subsequently migrate inwards over the course of a few million years .
Many astronomers believed this could happen due to gravitational interactions with the disk of dust from which they formed , which might have also subsequently formed Earth - like rocky planets .
However , these new results suggest that this may not be the whole story , because it does not explain how planets end up orbiting in a direction contrary that of the disk .
According to the research team , the best alternative migration theory suggests that the proximity of Hot Jupiters to their stars is not due to interactions with the dust disk at all , but to a slower evolution involving a gravitational tug - of - war with more distant planetary or stellar companions over hundreds of millions of years .
Bounced onto a tilted and elongated orbit , a wandering gas giant would suffer tidal friction every time it swung close to the star , eventually becoming parked in a near circular , but randomly tilted orbit close to the star .
" In this scenario , smaller planets in orbits similar to Earth 's are unlikely to survive , " said Rachel Street .
###
Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network is a non-profit organization dedicated to building a worldwide network of robotically controlled telescopes , which will enable astronomers to observe 24 hours a day , from both hemispheres .
Currently , LCOGT operates two 2.0 - meter telescopes : Faulkes North in Maui , Hawaii , and Faulkes South in New South Wales , Australia .
LCOGT also has a telescope in Sedgwick Reserve , a nature reserve in Central California funded and managed by UC and UCSB .
Over the course of the next few years , an armada of telescopes will be commissioned , distributed over six sites in both hemispheres of the globe , all controlled from LCOGT 's headquarters in Goleta , Calif .
These new facilities will be one of the largest networks of telescopes in the world , and will be an unprecedented tool for exploring the dynamic nature of a range of astrophysical phenomena .
LCOGT 's flexible approach to scheduling means the network provides responsive and highly efficient follow - up for large - scale surveys such as WASP .
LCOGT is affiliated with neighboring UC Santa Barbara .

Where They Stand : Defence More from Reality Check Welcome to Reality Check .
Today I 'm asking whether there is a cheaper alternative to the UK's Trident nuclear system .
The Liberal Democrat suggestion that Britain could find a " cheaper and better " alternative to Trident is one of the issues dividing the three main parties .
It provoked animated exchanges at the second prime ministerial debate on Thursday with leader Nick Clegg coming under attack from his rivals over plans to include Trident in the strategic defence review , which all three parties have promised to hold after the election .

Trident is certainly controversial and expensive - but could you really do it differently and for less money ?
Trident is a ballistic missile system based on four Vanguard - class submarines .
The advantage of submarines is that they are hard for any enemy to find - and one boat is always on patrol , providing the UK with a continuous at - sea deterrent .
The government , in its 2006 White Paper on Trident , said building the replacements would cost between £ 15bn and £ 20 bn .
The system needs to be renewed because the second of the current boats will go out of service in 2024 .
KEY TRIDENT FACTS Length : 44ft ( 13 m ) Weight : 130,000lb ( 58,500kg ) Diameter : 83 inches ( 2.1 m ) Range : 7,500 miles ( 12,000 km )
Power plant :
Three stage solid propellant rocket Cost : £ 16.8 m ( $ 29.1 m ) per missile
Full Trident Factfile
The government 's estimate - in 2006 prices - includes between £ 11bn and £ 14bn for four boats , plus between £ 2bn and £ 3bn for the refurbishment of the replacement warheads , plus from £ 2bn to £ 3bn for infrastructure over the life of the submarines - including upgrades at Aldermaston .
That figure did not include the running costs , maintenance or refitting of the submarines , or additional costs in the missile programme from 2030 , when the Trident D5 missile will be retired .
Opponents of Britain 's nuclear weapons system , including Greenpeace , claim the full cost of replacing and running the Trident system on a like - for - like basis , as both Labour and the Conservatives have pledged to do , will be between £ 80bn and £ 100 bn in total .
That works out at around £ 2bn pounds per year over the system 's expected lifetime of 40 years , or some 5 % of the annual defence budget , which currently stands at £ 38 bn a year .
Ballistic versus cruise British governments have studied three times whether there are cheaper ways than Trident ( or its predecessor ) of achieving the same aims , but each study concluded that this type of system provided the most credible and reliable nuclear weapon .
Trident 's ballistic missiles have a long range , of up to 7,500 miles .
One alternative that has been suggested is using cruise missiles based on different submarines .
However , cruise missiles have a far shorter range , of over 1,000 miles , and are slower and more vulnerable to being shot down .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Whether other potential alternatives would be much cheaper in practice is also disputed .
If Britain chose a cruise - missile system , it would probably have to develop its own missile programme , bearing all the research and development costs .
Dr Lee Willett , head of Maritime Studies Programme at the defence and security think - tank Royal United Services Institute , tells me a cruise missile has " neither the speed , the range or the survivability " of a ballistic missile .
He also says a cruise missile has significant consequences in terms of cost , as there is no hypersonic long - range cruise missile on the market - so Britain would have to look at developing one at great expense .
Vote winner ?
Others have suggested using a land - based delivery system , to avoid the cost of building new submarines .
But that has been rejected in the past as too vulnerable to attack - and impractical on these crowded islands .
The White Paper also concluded that the lifetime cost of this option would be double those of the submarine option .

Who 's right on National Insurance ?
Some say it would be cheaper to launch missiles from a long - range aircraft .
However , the shorter range would again be an issue - and the aircraft could be brought down .
The White Paper also examined having a large surface ship that could launch Trident missiles , but judged that the vessel would be too easy to detect .
So yes - there are alternatives to Trident .
But they are not necessarily cheaper , nor able to do what the current system does .
So if the UK decides it wants to remain a nuclear power , most defence experts believe Trident remains the only really credible option .
However , the Liberal Democrat suggestion that Trident should form part of the strategic defence review could re-open the debate , and arguments over Trident may well prove attractive to voters - not least those who ask if the UK should remain a nuclear - armed state at all .
A selection of your comments are below .
We should hand over the nuclear deterrent to the EU and let the 26 member states share the cost , that way we get the protection at a fraction of the cost .
Kevin , London
It really is extraordinary that there are still so many naive people who believe that by giving up nuclear weapons we will make Britain - and the world - a safer place .
There were similar fools about just before the second world war who wanted to get rid of the RAF because of the horrific consequences of bombing .
Thanks heavens we did not listen to them .
Guy , London
The money for Trident could be used to fund better intelligence services to detect and deter would - be terrorists .
David , Milton Keynes Everyone here is talking about the threat now , but Trident is not due to come into service for 14 years .
Who can predict what threats there will be to world peace in 14 years time , from developing nuclear nations such as Iran and North Korea ?
Claudia , Marlow
The UK has an opportunity to set a shining example to the world by being the first nation to give up nuclear weapons
Nick , Hampshire
We need to keep Trident .
If nuclear arms was not important in today 's world why do Iran and other countries desperately try and get this capability .
It 's not just a deterrent as well , building the astute class subs keeps a lot of highly skilled and unique engineers in work , if we stopped we would lose the skills forever !
Dan , Guildford
The main threat today to our safety are the small groups out there and not a single country , the smaller groups who would use dirty bombs and other low - tech ways of attacking us .
But this has not always been the case and who can predict what will happen between great powers in the future .
Trident may become our main deterrent against attack once again .
Just because right now it seems a waste of money to replace our nuclear deterrent does not mean this is the way it will always be .
Craig , Bedlington
The alternative to Trident is simple .
Better health service and more police on the beat .
We are paying billions of pounds to protect against a nuclear threat that might happen - but even then mutual destruction is hardly beneficial .
No missile can stop another London underground bombing .
Trident wont ward off a terrorist armed with bacteriological weapons .
We need to drop the nuclear posturing and concentrate our spending on making day to day life better for all our citizens .
Nick , Hove If Trident is manufactured using a large proportion of UK resources then the money does n't leave the country .
And it supports UK jobs , intellectual property and skills development .
So what is the problem .
If the alternatives are imported ( from America ) then the cash does leave , we lose the jobs skills and knowledge and hence devalue Britain .
Billy , Cheshire
When USA and Russia have agreed to reduce their nuclear armoury , Obama is talking about a world without nuclear weapons and Britain is skint , does it make any sense to renew a system that 's likely to provoke other nations to obtain nuclear capability ?
We should also be working for reform of the UN so that possession of nuclear weapons does not earn entitlement to a permanent seat on the Security Council .
P. Harding , London
The argument about the systems is completely irrelevant .
The key question is does Britain need ( or can afford ) a late 20th century concept to defend its people in the early 21st century ?
When the more likely threats are from terrorists ( foreign & home grown ) who will employ simpler and cheaper ways of causing destruction ( 9/11 , dirty bombs and chemical weapons etc ) what good are submarines patrolling around with nuclear warheads .
It is no ' insurance policy ' against terrorists & therefore a waste of our limited resources .
Steve , Alfreton , Derbyshire Succinctly : a ) we do need a nuclear deterrent b ) we need to constantly review perceived threats c ) we no longer need cold war defences d ) we do need a credible and mobile response e ) we need to understand that future enemies may not be deterred by retaliation .
Its a bit late then anyway f ) a European solution should be preferred with cost spread across all members of EU and NATO .
Richard , Norwich Just whom is Trident supposed to deter ?
The current threat to world security comes from faceless amorphous groups who are prepared to use their own people to deliver death via suicide attacks .
Are they likely to be deterred by the threat of a nuclear strike ?
And what would we aim such a strike at ?
Cameron and Brown are living in the past like a couple of old generals preparing to fight tanks with mounted cavalry .
Get real boys .
Or at the very least get up to date .
Neil , Nantwich
What does it matter if we lose , or limit , our nuclear deterrent ?
Germany and Japan are both doing very well without one .
Britain seems obsessed with punching above it's weight - we 're no longer a huge empire .
We need to try to scale back our ambitions .
Even if we had a full array of nuclear weapons , I can't foresee any plausible scenario in which we 'd actually use them .
Who would want to be remembered as the Prime Minister that killed millions of innocent civilians by nuking a city in a revenge attack ?
Ian , Saffron Walden
In the current uncertain times and even more uncertain future of the world , it always pays to have the best deterrent " insurance " policy .
So yes we should renew Trident .
There are no other options which give the same performance .
Hopefully it will never be used but its stupid to say its a waste of money .
Who see's that having an insurance policy you pay for and never use ( car , travel etc ) is a waste ?

More than half the money raised in the name of charity by Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment was spent on fundraising and administration last year .
And the story is much the same at many professional sports foundations across Canada , a Star investigation has found .
Lavish gala dinners , golf tournaments and lotteries held by Canadian NHL club foundations routinely eat up between 40 and 65 per cent of revenues — and as much as 80 per cent in the case of the Edmonton Oilers ’ foundation in 2008 — intended for disadvantaged children and community development .
Experts say well - run charitable operations should be directing less than 20 per cent of their charitable income on fundraising and administration .
“ Canadians love their hockey teams , but it appears the charitable spending among these teams do n’t return that affection as expected , ” says Toronto forensic accountant Charles Smedmor .
“ As community investments go , there are much better places to put your charitable dollars . ”
Dr. Bruce Kidd , who was announced as chair of MLSE ’s Team Up foundation in December , said his board of directors is “ very concerned about the costs . ”
“ We are looking at the costs and the return on all of our activities and we ’re trying to make them more effective to get the costs down to where they represent the industry standards or better than that . ”
Fundraising and administration consumed 55 per cent of the $ 1.5 million raised last year by Team Up , according to the foundation ’s self - reported figures to the Canada Revenue Agency .
That compares to 17 per cent reported by the Montreal Canadiens Children ’s Foundation , the lowest figure among the country ’s six NHL club foundations .
The other four team foundations reported internal costs of between 42 and 65 per cent last year .
The figures from Team Up , a newly - branded merging of philanthropic efforts for the Toronto Maple Leafs , Raptors , Marlies and Toronto FC , raise questions about the charity ’s oversight of charitable dollars , say financial experts and forensic accountants who reviewed the records for the Star .
“ The smart money is n’t giving through sports foundations ( like Team Up ) to achieve impact , ” says Kate Bahen , managing director of Charity Intelligence Canada , a non-profit organization that analyzes charity finances .
“ ( MLSE ) is a massive hockey machine .
But to present Team Up as experts in community development is a stretch . ”
Asked what he ’d tell a client donating money to Team Up , forensic accountant Ken Froese says : “ I ’d say find another way to give it more directly … to where it will make a difference . ”
Froese , who reviewed Team Up ’s filings for the Star , said he was “ surprised ” by the numbers .
“ It should be the leading example in Canada for a sports foundation .
But the foundation is a way of raising money and a lot of the use of the funds gives you advertising for the Raptors or the Toronto Maple Leafs .
Other ( charities ) are more intent on solving issues and less on administration . ”
Kevin Nonomura , Team
Up ’s treasurer and senior vice - president of finance for MLSE , said “ this past year was a tough year for us . ”
“ We understand , from an outside perspective , it does n’t look very good . …
I ’d like ( fundraising and administration costs ) to be as low as possible .
And that ’s why we ’re trying to look at diversifying the way we raise money and try and find more efficient ways , effective ways to raise money . ”
The federal Charities Directorate , which regulates the country ’s 83,000 registered charities , says fundraising of more than 35 per cent of revenues triggers an examination “ to determine if there is a trend of high fundraising costs . ”
The Star ’s analysis shows five of the six NHL team charity foundations exceed that threshold .
All continue to operate without penalty .
CRA officials do n’t comment on specific charities and their fundraising costs .
“ ( The numbers ) tell me that Anglo - Canadian sports teams should stay out of the charity business based on the efficiency by which they generate and expend their funds , ” says Ian Wintrip , a Toronto forensic accountant .
“ When you look at ( Team Up’s ) administration and fundraising costs ... your objective would n’t be to have an organization like that .
You would have loftier goals than that . ”
Team Up and similar NHL club foundations do contribute to important community work .
Over the past 15 years , the Leafs Fund and Raptors Foundation — predecessors to Team Up — raised close to $ 30 million for disadvantaged youth , says a December press release announcing the newly named foundation .
MLSE has dedicated about $ 1.6 million over the past four years to building and refurbishing 13 hockey rinks , six basketball courts and three soccer pitches .
It also provides hundreds of “ in- kind ” gifts – autographed jerseys , plaques and memorabilia – to registered charities and schools to support their own community - based work .
Foundation records obtained by the Star show that nearly 60 per cent of the more than 750 gifts Team Up donated last year were valued at $ 25 or less .
All of those little gifts amount to a big drain on resources , says forensic accountant Smedmor .
“ Team Up 's administration costs appear to be eating more of its donation and investment income than expected . ”
Fundraising was Team
Up ’s single biggest expenditure last year at nearly $ 700,000 .
In one case last year , the foundation paid a fundraiser nearly $ 24,000 to generate $ 3,200 in funds .
That $ 20,000 fundraising shortfall reflects a recent change in “ strategic direction ” towards attracting for philanthropic donations , says MLSE spokesperson Rajani Kamath , who would not name the fundraiser .
“ We were prepared to make a short - term investment to recognize a long - term gain for our foundation . ”
Many of the typical fundraising activities of sports foundations like Team Up come with big overhead .
Every dollar that comes in from game night 50/50 draws — lotteries that direct half the ticket sale proceeds to the charity and the other half to a winning ticket holder — only bring in 40 to 45 cents on the dollar , says Nonomura .
“ It has the lowest net and highest expenses against it . …
From the 50 cents we ’re getting , we have to pay for the lottery licenses , the ticket printing and … someone to manage the program .
It ’s a high cost . ”
Compare that to the Montreal Canadiens ’ foundation , whose game - night lotteries ( 50/50 draws are not permitted in Quebec ) hands back less than 20 per cent of total revenues to winners while keeping 80 per cent as charitable income .
Charity fundraising dinners – the bread and butter of many sports foundations – are one of the biggest revenue eaters .
A gala fundraiser held by the ( Vancouver ) Canucks For Kids foundation raised $ 300,000 for the charity ’s work with children in need last year , says executive director Debbie Butt .
But that ’s only after spending $ 200,000 to stage the event .
“ You ’ve got a hotel ballroom , you ’ve got to pay $ 60 a head and you ’ve got 700 people in the room … you have alcohol and corkage , then you have lights and staging , ” said Butt , whose charity spent $ 2.1 million on fundraising and administration last year — 42 per cent of its total revenues .
“ That ’s a big overhead . ”

It ’s no coincidence that sports foundations overwhelmingly target children as their charitable focus , says Bahen of Charity Intelligence .
“ If you want to raise money , of course you pick kids ’ causes because that will outdraw a charity for seniors eight to one .
But this is n’t serious giving .
It ’s fundraising , marketing and glitz .
The less you spend on flower arrangements and glitz , the more that goes to good . ”
The Montreal Canadiens Children ’s Foundation raised $ 3.4 million last year – more than doubling Team Up ’s revenues -- without holding a gala fundraising event .
“ I have seen gala dinners with costs of hosting up to 40 to 50 per cent of gross take , ” said Pierre Boivin , chair of the foundation and president of the Montreal Canadiens .
“ We do n’t have that as a recurring event . ”
Danielle Robinson , president of the Sens Foundation , says high event costs are a struggle in most sports charities .
“ People expect a certain quality of event when they ’re paying a $ 4,000 for a table ( at a gala ) , ” said Robinson , whose foundation spent 49 per cent of revenues on fundraising and administration last year .
“ A 30 per cent target as something we should all be striving to sit around . ”
The Toronto Blue Jays ’ charity , the Jays Care Foundation , spent 39 per cent of total revenues on fundraising and administration in 2008 , the last year it reported its figures .
That ’s high , says executive director Danielle Silverstein .
“ It ’s a number I pay attention to .
We ’re very focused on it . … I ’d love for it to be under 30 per cent . ”
The Edmonton Oilers Community Foundation shows the highest fundraising costs among Canadian NHL club foundations .
It spent 65 per cent of its revenues on internal costs last year – down from 80 per cent in 2008 .
That dramatically higher spending — totaling $ 6.5 million last year and $ 9.1 million a year earlier — is largely attributable to an initiative unique to NHL club foundations :
A high - profile lottery that includes lavish prizes such as cars , trips and a luxury home .
“ Expenses are high because that ’s the nature of the program , ” said foundation executive director Natalie Minckler .
“ We were looking for ways to raise big dollars and bake sales were n’t going to cut it . ”

Cops in Corpus Christi , who are clearly very well - intentioned but maybe not the sharpest tools in the police shed , seized some 400 marijuana plants from a city park .
Only , they were not marijuana , so much as , " horsemint . "
A " teen riding his bike through Waldron Park " gave the Corpus Christi police a call on Friday night to alert them to all the marijuana plants that were growing there .
And the police , ever the responsive , civic - minded public servants , showed up very quickly and " hauled away 300 - 400 medium - sized plants , " stopping because it became too dark .
Only :
However , after spending more than an hour removing and tagging the hundreds of plants , then hauling it all down the police department downtown , testing revealed that none of it was marijuana at all .
According to local news station KRIST KRIS , the plants were , in fact , a common weed called " horsemint . "
You snigger now , but could you tell the difference between horsemint and marijuana ?
Here is a handy guide :
Horsemint
Appearance : According to Wikipedia , " The leaves are oblong - elliptical to lanceolate , 5 – 10 cm long and 1.5 –3 cm broad , thinly to densely tomentose , green to greyish - green above and white below .

Two former CIA officials have admitted to creating a fake video in which intelligence officers dressed up as Osama Bin Laden and his cronies in an effort to defame the terrorist leader throughout the middle east .
The details are outlined in a Washington Post article by investigative reporter and former Army Intelligence case officer Jeff Stein .
Stein ’s sources told him that during planning for the 2003 invasion of Iraq , the CIA ’s Iraq Operations Group considered creating a fake video of Saddam Hussein engaged in sexual acts with a teenage boy , then flooding Iraq with copies of the tape .
That idea , along with faking Iraqi news bulletins , never came to fruition according to the former CIA officials , because agreement on the projects could not be reached between the Iraq Group and CIA ’s Office of Technical Services .
However , the two sources reveal that the agency did previously concoct at least one fake Bin Laden video :
The agency actually did make a video purporting to show Osama bin Laden and his cronies sitting around a campfire swigging bottles of liquor and savoring their conquests with boys , one of the former CIA officers recalled , chuckling at the memory .
The actors were drawn from “ some of us darker - skinned employees , ” he said .
The former officials told Stein that the project was taken over by the military after it ground to a halt :
The reality , the former officials said , was that the agency really did n’t have enough money and expertise to carry out the projects .
“ The military took them over , ” said one .
“ They had assets in psy - war down at Ft. Bragg , ” at the army ’s special warfare center .
This latest revelation bolsters evidence that the intelligence agencies , and perhaps more significantly , the military have been engaged in creating fake Bin Laden videos in the past .
As we have exhaustively documented , Intelcenter , the U.S. monitoring group that routinely releases Bin Laden video and audio , much of which have been proven to be either rehashed old footage or outright fakes , is an offshoot of IDEFENSE , a web security company that monitors intelligence from the middle east .
IDEFENSE is heavily populated by long serving ex military intelligence officials , such as senior military psy - op intelligence officer Jim Melnick , who served 16 years in the US army and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) in psychological operations .
Melnick has also worked directly for former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
Intelcenter notoriously released the “ laughing hijackers ” tape and claimed it was an Al - Qaeda video , despite the fact that the footage was obtained by a “ security agency ” at a 2000 Bin Laden speech .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
IntelCenter was also caught adding its logo to a tape at the same time as Al - Qaeda ’s so - called media arm As - Sahab added its logo , proving the two organizations were one and the same .
Could the CIA group of “ dark skinned actors ” have been behind the infamous December 2001 “ Fat nosed ” Bin Laden video , that was magically found in a house in Jalalabad after anti-Taliban forces moved in ?
The tape featured a fat Osama laughing and joking about how he ’d carried out 9/11 .
The video was also mistranslated in order to manipulate viewer opinion and featured “ Bin Laden ” praising two of the hijackers , only he got their names wrong .
This Osama also used the wrong hand to write with and wore gold rings , a practice totally in opposition to the Muslim faith .
Despite the fact that the man in the video looks nothing like Bin Laden , the CIA stood by it and declared it to be the official “ 9/11 confession video ” .
The latest revelations also shed light on another past Bin Laden release – a tape in which he ludicrously declared himself in league with Saddam Hussein in the weeks before the invasion of Iraq .
The notion that the CIA project was taken over and drastically improved by the Pentagon at some point after 2003 jives with the improvement in quality of Bin Laden videos in later years .
Most notably the video that was released immediately ahead of the 2004 election , and it ’s digitally manipulated duplicate from 2007 , in which Bin Laden appeared to have a dyed beard .
For a run down of some of the most notoriously dubious Bin Laden videos see the following article .

North Korea has heavy state censors and few citizens have internet access
Details of a home - grown computer operating system developed by North Korea have emerged .
Information about Red Star , as it is known , was made public by a Russian blogger studying in North Korea , who bought the program off the street .
Further analysis by a government institute in neighbouring South Korea said the operating system is aimed at monitoring user activity .
However , very few North Koreans own a computer or have internet access .
Web content is also heavily censored .
It is designed " to control [ North Korea 's ] own information security " , a report by South Korea 's Science and Technology Policy Institute ( STPI ) said .
" Due to few applicable programmes available , Red Star will not even be easily distributed in North Korea , " it added .
The Russian blogger , identified only as Mikhail , said Red Star could be bought in Pyongyang for around $ 5 .
He has also posted a series of screenshots on his blog .
Pigeon mail
The operating system represents the determination of North Korea to advance its own computer technology , based on its " Juche " self - reliance philosophy .
The Red Star operating system uses a popular Korean folk song as its start - up music and numbers years using a calendar which starts counting from the birth of state founder Kim Il- sung , making 2010 the 99th year .
It is Linux - based but is heavily influenced by Microsoft with open - source versions of the software giant 's Office programmes , including several familiar games .
It runs only in the Korean language and takes 15 minutes to install , reports said .
It has games , an e-mail system known as Pigeon and a Mozilla 's Firefox internet browser - which has the North Korean government website as a home page .
The US government has banned the uploading and downloading of open source code to residents of a handful of countries on its sanctions list , which includes North Korea .
The STPI report also said that North Korea has launched a cyber - war unit that targets sites in South Korea and the US .
In July last year South Korea experienced a wave of cyber - attacks which attempted to paralyse a number of websites .
US websites including the Pentagon and the White House were also targeted .
Reports suggested that the attacks might have originated in North Korea .
MOSCOW 
For a few days this month , Moscow political circles were transfixed by a rather exotic spectacle : the leader of an opposition party was criticizing Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin .
This was not just any leader .
It was Sergei M. Mironov , whose career in the opposition has been distinguished by passionate loyalty to Mr. Putin .
When he ran against Mr. Putin for president in 2004 , he said he was running because “ when a leader you believe in goes into battle , you ca n’t leave him alone , you must stand with him . ”
Two years later he promised that A Just Russia , his new party , would “ follow the course of President Vladimir Putin and will not allow anyone to veer from it after Putin leaves his post . ”
Many observers long ago wrote off A Just Russia as “ pocket opposition , ” devised to give the appearance of political competition where none existed .
So it came as a surprise when Mr. Mironov , who Mr. Putin installed as speaker of the upper house of Parliament , told the television talk show host Vladimir V. Pozner that it was “ outdated information to say that we , and personally I , have supported Vladimir Putin in everything , ” noting that the party members “ categorically opposed ” Mr. Putin ’s budget .
Mr. Pozner was taken aback  “ nobody in that position has said anything negative about Putin , ” he said later  and watched with real curiosity to see if officials at state - controlled Channel
One would edit out the remark before it was broadcast in Moscow .
They did not .
For six strange days , Mr. Mironov defended his right to criticize Mr. Putin while officials at the governing party , United Russia , said he should lose his post for his show of ingratitude .
The fuss ended with a public reconciliation between the pro-Putin parties , and all the planets seemed to realign .
But during an unpredictable political season in Russia , a question was left hanging in the air :
Under the right set of circumstances , could a docile , dependent opposition turn into the real thing ?
The virus affects most children before the age of two A virus that causes wheezing and pneumonia claims the lives of up to 200,000 children worldwide each year , a study has found .
University of Edinburgh scientists found that about 3.4 million children were hospitalised after contracting respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) .
RSV is the single largest cause of lung infection in children .
The scientists hope the research will help contribute to the development of a vaccine against the infection .
The study , which has been published in The Lancet , confirmed that RSV - which infects most children before the age of two - usually causes mild cold - like symptoms , but can lead to serious illness in babies who are born prematurely or who have congenital heart disease .
This is the first time we have gathered information on such a global scale and is the best estimate we have for the number of children dying each year from this preventable illness
Dr Harish Nair
University of Edinburgh
It is the first time that the numbers of children dying globally from RSV before the age of five have been quantified .
The international team analysed unpublished data from developing countries as well as all the published medical research on RSV infection .
They found that about 33.8 million children become infected with RSV each year and that 99 % of RSV - related deaths occur in developing countries .
The team hopes that by identifying the numbers affected by the virus , it can contribute to the development of a vaccine against the infection .
Dr Harish Nair , of the University of Edinburgh 's department of population health studies , said : " Our greatest hope of fighting this virus is to develop a vaccine , but before we can implement an immunisation programme , we need to understand exactly how big a problem RSV poses .
" This is the first time we have gathered information on such a global scale and is the best estimate we have for the number of children dying each year from this preventable illness . "
Professor Warren Lenney , spokesman for the British Lung Foundation , the only charity helping people with all lung diseases , said : " Acute Viral Bronchiolitis ( RSV ) is a respiratory virus which is not well known , however it is the most common reason for tiny babies to be admitted to hospital within the first year of life - across England and Wales RSV causes 20,000 babies to be admitted to hospital each year during the winter months . "
He welcomed the research as indicating the size of the problem on a global scale .
" RSV not only causes respiratory problems in early life but can lead to other long - term chest problems well into teenage years , " the professor added .

With the first procedural vote on financial reform pending this afternoon , this survey has to be looming over Republicans .
About two - thirds of Americans support stricter regulations on the way banks and other financial institutions conduct their business , according to a new Washington Post - ABC News poll .
Majorities also back two main components of legislation congressional Democrats plan to bring to a vote in the Senate this week : greater federal oversight of consumer loans and a company - paid fund that would cover the costs of dismantling failed firms that put the broader economy at risk .
A third pillar of the reform effort draws a more even split : 43 percent support federal regulation of the derivatives market ; 41 percent are opposed .
Nearly one in five - 17 percent - express no opinion on this complicated topic .....
The area with the highest levels of cross-party support is on more robust federal oversight of the way banks and other financial companies make consumer loans , such as auto loans , credit cards and mortgages .
Here , 44 percent of Republicans approve of stricter guidelines , joining 75 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of independents on the issue .
Rail transport is usually the most suitable mode of transportation for heavy traffic flows when speed is also an advantage because of the lower cost per person per load as the train load increases .
In Tanzania , rail transport accounts less than a half per cent to the GDP of the country .
Although rail has always contributed a tiny proportion of value - added in transportation , its share of value - added continues to decline because road transport ( freight and passenger ) has virtually taken over all the traffic previously conveyed by rail .
The railways in Tanzania are regulated and operated by the Tanzanian Railway Corporation , which was established by the government .
It inherited a rail network , from British Colonial masters , which was designed in a fashion to facilitate the flow of goods , such as groundnuts , Coffee , Maize and cotton , from the inlands to the coast , where they were shipped to Britain .
During this period , Tanzania ’s single - narrow - gauge railway line was constructed and for many years was the only mode of freight movement between parts of the country .
The current rail network consists of gauge tracks and of standard gauge tracks which connect Dar es salaam With Other Towns
Years of neglect and lack of investments have severely hampered the capacity of the rail network to act as a mass transit vehicle .
As part of its plans to revitalise the nation ’s railways , the government has privatise the Tanzanian Railway Corporation ( TRC ) .
Under the privatisation plan , the government HAS grant concession to private sector companies , who WHERE expected to provide train service and maintain the infrastructure .
However the government could go a lot further by separating the railway operations in to two broad categories – railway infrastructure and train operations , and form a railways regulatory body which regulate activities in the railways sector .
Also proceeds from the privatisation process should be put into a National Railway Fund which will be used to finance railway projects .
Railway Infrastructure Company ( RIC )
The ownership and maintenance of the national railway infrastructure will be transferred to a newly established special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) which will be partially owned by the Government and private investors .
The initial lifespan of the SPV will be for thirty years with the purpose of updating and maintaining the national rail network .
The RIC will also be responsible expanding the network around the country and building new rail links as air - rail links which connect the countries airports to the centre of cities they serve , similar to the Paddington Heathrow Express in the UK .
It will also be responsible for traffic control and signaling , and the construction of new train stations on the railway network .
The RIC will also take ownership of all the existing train stations and warehouses owned by the TRC in the country , which it could operate itself or lease out to train operating companies , who will also provide passenger and freight train services out of the any of the train stations in their command .
The newly formed RIC will have the following streams of revenue :
• Track Services
Fees :
These are fees that the company will charge train operators who make use of its tracks for passenger and freight services .
• Station and Warehouse Leases :
This includes the revenue accrued by leasing out train stations and warehouses to train operators .
• Government Subsidies : Because of the capital intensive nature of rail track maintenance and new line creations , the Government , through the National Railway Fund , will subsidise some of its operations .
The amount of subsidies given will be based on the performance of the company in the previous year .
The review of subsidies would be done on a yearly basis until the company is at the stage where it does not require government subsidies to run its operations .
The RIC will be subject to regulation from a newly created railway board , which monitor its performance and will pass down fines in areas in which the company has failed to meet standards or agreed milestones .
For the time being , it would be more economical to keep and update Tanzania ’s narrow gauge tracks , rather than convert them to the standard gauge tracks .
Narrow gauge tracks tend to be slower , carry less load and far less adaptable than the standard gauge tracks .
However narrow gauge tracks involve significantly less civil engineering costs and countries like Japan , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa have shown that with the right calibration and design , it is possible to get almost the same performance of standard gauge tracks out of narrow tracks .
200 - car trains operate on the Sishen - Saldanha railroad in South Africa , and Queensland Rail ’s tilt train is presently the fastest train in Australia , despite running on narrow gauge tracks .
Train Operating Companies ( TOCs )
These will be private sector companies which will operate passenger and / or freight train services on the national rail network .
In order to offer train services , potential companies will have to bid for a franchise license from the railways regulatory body , which will grant them a government backed monopoly to operate services on certain routes for a specified duration .
The TOCs will responsible for providing their own rolling stock ( locomotives , railroad cars , coaches and wagons ) .
The rolling stock will be have of an agreed standard and quality to avoid train companies from using old and unsafe equipment to ferry passengers .
The TOCs will also agree to lease a number of train stations from the RIC for passenger services and warehouses for freight services .
These facilities will be located along the route in which they operate .
Under the lease agreement the TOCs will be responsible for the following :
• Maintenance and upgrade of the buildings and land on which the facility is located .
• Security at the facilities .
• Train ticket payment collections .
• Commercial activities at passenger stations , such as the renting of shop spaces .
• Parking fee collection from other TOCs who might decide to park their own trains at the station overnight .
Railway Services Companies ( RSCs )
The services units of the TRC which provide direct services to the railway industry will be sold to private companies .
The benefit of selling the units is to aid them focus on their core business and improve the efficiency of the services they provide .
The services units include :
• The workshop services unit :
The unit mainly provides maintenance of rolling stocks .
• Printing press :
This unit is responsible for the printing of the all the tickets currently used on the national rail network .
• Catering services :
This unit presently provides catering services on the long distance train services .
The proceeds from the sales of these business units will be paid directly into the National Railway Fund .
Railways Regulatory Board
The Government will establish a new railway regulatory body which will oversee all activities in the Tanzanian railways sector .
The major responsibilities of the body will be to
• Carry out economic , environmental and safety regulation of the railways sector .
• Work cross the borders with Tanzania ’s neighbours to ensure harmonisation with the country ’s rail network .
• Monitor performance of the RIC and its agreed milestone attainments .
• Negotiate franchise agreements with TOCs and monitor their performances .
• Assist state governments in establishing intra cities mass transit rail networks .
• Investigate major incidents and accidents that occur on the railways .
• Monitor observance of public service obligations
• Conflict resolutions within the rail network system
Intra City Light Rail Systems
While state governments will be responsible for the development and deployment of a light rail system within their states , they would however be able to apply for financial assistance from the National Railway Fund .
Interested state government will submit their proposals to the Fund which will make a determination into the amount of money it plans to contribute towards the project .
Every submission will be treated on a case by case basis as to determine the economic viability of the project and its likely social and environmental impact .
Winding up the National Railway Corporation
Once the national rail infrastructure , the train operation and support services have been be taken up by the companies as described earlier , the National Railway Corporation will be wound up as a legal entity and the remaining operational and non–operational assets sold off .
The proceeds of the sale will be added to the National Railway Fund .
The rolling stock could be sold to the TOCs or other companies and individuals express an interest in those assets .
The Government should transfer all the assets held by the Railway Property Company Limited , a subsidiary of the TRC , which manages nearly 200 square metres of non-operational lands and landed properties held by the TRC , to the National Railway Fund , which will either sell or grow these assets .
While it would be desirable to ensure that all members of staff of the TRC be retained or reassigned by the new companies taking over , it is more practical to expect that a only a certain percentage would be rehired as a means of making these companies more efficient .
National Railway Fund ( NRF )
The National Railway Fund will be established primarily to provide financial assistance to the railway sector .
NRF will be registered as a company limited by guarantee and operate independently of the Railways Regulatory Board and Railways Infrastructure Company .
The Fund will be administered and managed by a Board of Trustees representing various interests in the public and private sector and will be completely isolated from the management of the Railways Regulatory Board and Railways Infrastructure Company .
The Fund will be required to release quarterly reports on the how much of its funds are being spent and how is being spent on any of the operations is it financing .
The NRF will be responsible for :
• Providing subsidies to the RIC to assist it in the maintenance and upgrade of the national railway network .
• Provide financial assistance to state governments looking to develop their own light rail networks .
NRF will be financed by :
• Proceeds from the privatisation process of the TRC .
• A railway tax passed on to passengers and companies who make use of the national railways .
The tax will be 5 % of the cost of a train ticket or freighting goods by rail .
• Returns on investments made by the management board in the global capital and money market .
• Grants from governments , organised private sector and international donors

The Acorn employees in Brooklyn who were captured on a hidden camera seeming to offer conservative activists posing as a pimp and a prostitute creative advice on how to get a mortgage have been cleared of wrongdoing by the Brooklyn district attorney ’s office .
District Attorney Charles J. Hynes said in a statement on Monday that “ no criminality has been found ” in his investigation of the three employees , who had appeared to advise the woman , who was scantily dressed and identified herself as an “ outcall ” specialist , not to tell prospective lenders that she was a prostitute and to funnel her earnings to her “ pimp ” through a third party so that he would not be tied to her .
Mr. Hynes declined to elaborate on his decision .
The videos , made in Acorn ’s field offices in Brooklyn and elsewhere , became a YouTube hit .
Critics of Acorn ( short for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ) , an influential national organization known for left - leaning voter activism and work on moderate - income housing , had cited the videos as evidence of the group ’s corruption .
Last summer , James O’Keefe and Hannah Giles visited Acorn offices in several cities using the pimp and prostitute tale and asked for help in getting a mortgage , saying that their lack of on - the - books income would make it hard for them to get a conventional bank loan .

I have never met anyone who stays as lean as Martin Berkhan does year round .
In fact , most people think it is near impossible to stay below 6 % body fat for more than a few days at a time .
Martin has held at a steady 5 - 6 % body fat for three years straight !
Many people will immediately think it is just do to great genetics or a naturally fast metabolism , but they would be wrong .
He was a chubby kid growing up and simply figured out a methodology of staying lean without depriving himself of good food .
He outlines these methods on his outstanding blog , Lean Gains .
Here is an exclusive guest article he wrote for Fitness Black Book .
[ Yeah , I probably overdo the fire effects on this site .
I just could n’t resist with the word “ scorch ” in the title . ]
- by Martin Berkhan
This article ’s title was originally going to be “ Food Choices That Kill Your Chance of Getting Lean ” per Rusty ’s suggestion .
But it would be highly ironic if I , who regularly ate ice cream and cereal on my last cut to 5.5 % body fat , told you that there are certain foods that would kill your chance of getting lean .
Besides that , there are about one billion articles on what foods cause fat gain or stall fat loss .
You ’ve seen them and it ’s usually the same tired stuff .
Do you guys need another article telling you to avoid white bread , fast food and hot pockets ?
Nope .
So I asked myself how to approach this topic and make it worth your while .
There ’s no food that , once you eat it , flips on a metabolic switch that completely shuts down fat burning and weight loss if you ’re maintaining a daily caloric deficit .
It ’s a question of quantity , moderation and context .
[ Martin Berkhan at 5.5 % body fat ]
I believe most foods can be consumed in the right context , but should be avoided in another context , in order to optimize body recomposition and fat loss .
For example , most of my clients consume a fair amount of starchy carbohydrates following a workout .
This is n’t a problem because it ’s part of optimizing the plan .
In this context , starchy carbs are great for restoring muscle glycogen .
On rest days however , my clients might skip starches , eating fewer carbs and more satiating ones .
This strategy optimizes satiety , fat loss , diet adherence and performance .
That being said , there are some foods that should be ditched first from your diet if weight loss is stalling or if you want to speed things up .
Same thing goes if you just want to make the diet as easy and painless as possible .
Having reviewed and created hundreds of meal plans throughout the years , I know a little something about this topic .
Your diet is where you fix things first and foremost .
Adding more cardio when your diet is suboptimal is an inefficient and time - wasting strategy that will result in an increased risk of burnout and overtraining .
In this article I ’ll spotlight a few less - than - obvious staples that people tend to include in their diets .
These are foods that people generally think of as “ healthy ” and diet friendly , when they can be diet killers in disguise .
Nuts , protein bars and dried fruit
Nuts in all their various forms are the most overrated and overhyped foods in the “ health conscious ” community .
Just because it ’s a natural food does n’t mean it ’s all that diet friendly or even healthy for that matter .
Packing a higher calorie density than chocolate , it ’s no big mystery that people easily overdo it with nuts .
Some people rationalize a high nut consumption by saying it ’s a healthy and natural snack , but this is wrong .
Nuts contain an incomplete amino acid profile and consist mostly of plant fats .
The westernized diet is already highly unbalanced in the omega 3 : omega 6 - ratio — the polyunsaturated fats from nuts certainly wo n’t help .
Optimize the fat composition of your diet by kicking nuts to the curb and add more fish , that ’s my recommendation .
You ’ll be more satiated and healthier to boot .
A protein bar is nothing more than a chocolate bar with slightly higher protein content and crappier taste .
A whopping 300 calories for a bar that you ’ll gulf down in a few minutes is crazy .
For most women that amount makes up about ¼ - 1/5 of the daily total calorie intake needed to lose fat efficiently .
Besides that , eating protein bars to up your protein intake is n’t a great strategy as a bar ’s protein content makes up only about 30 - 40 % of its calories .
You could down half a Snickers bar and a protein shake , and end up consuming fewer calories with a better nutritional breakdown than having your typical protein bar .
Protein bars are nothing more than glamorized candy .
And you do n’t eat candy on a regular basis if you want to optimize fat loss and diet adherence .
Unprocessed fruit is good , but dried fruit including dried apricots , dates and raisins are just sugar lumps with some extra fiber .
These snacks have high calorie density and tend to stimulate hunger rather than quench it .
Out of the three popular snacks discussed here , dried fruit may just be the worst of the lot .
You do n’t want or need them on a fat loss diet .
Shakes
Shakes , liquids and anything else that resembles baby food should n’t stay on menu when it ’s time to shave off calories or make your diet more manageable and painless .
This includes “ recovery shakes ” with high - glycemic index carbs and protein shakes , fruit juices , milk and yogurt .
Packing a good deal of calories in proportion to the little satiety they provide , liquid calories have no place in your diet other than for convenience .
Think you need a “ recovery shake ” post - workout ?
Think again .
Unless you ’re an elite athlete training twice a day and need to refill muscle glycogen as fast as possible for your next training session , “ fast carbs ” are a complete waste of calories .
Your time ( and money ) is better spent with whole food carbohydrates that offer chewing resistance .
Are you drinking whey protein shakes throughout the day because you ’re too lazy to cook or eat real food ?
Well , if you ’re too lazy to step into the kitchen or chew your food , you ’re probably not going to reach your fat loss goals anyway .
I ’d rather have you learn to savour a good steak with veggies rather than rapidly chugging insulin - spiking and appetite - triggering whey protein shakes .
Liquid calories should be replaced with whole foods , including your protein choices .
But if you must supplement your diet with protein shakes , I recommend casein or milk protein isolate over whey .
What about those vitamin drinks , smoothies and fruit juices people are drinking to make sure they ’re getting enough antioxidants , vitamins , and minerals ?
Another complete waste of calories
Do you think you risk missing vital nutrients if you cut these “ health drinks ” out from your diet ?
It ’s actually the other way around : strong evidence suggests that overdoing intake of antioxidants and vitamins can negatively affect your health and your training results .
A balanced diet with wholesome foods such as meat , eggs , berries , veggies and some starches , does n’t need vitamin or antioxidant support .
It has everything in abundance .
If you ’re still paranoid , take a multivitamin with your first meal .
Breakfast
I apologize in advance to readers who were expecting a third group of food items that I think should be ditched from your diet .
This is in part tongue - in - cheek .
There is nothing inherently bad about breakfast .
Nor is there anything inherently good about it either .
But for me , skipping breakfast was the single greatest diet fix I ever made and the one that allowed me to really take it to the next level in terms of lowering my body fat .
There ’s a lesson in here , so keep reading even if you do n’t think you can live without breakfast .
I was never a breakfast person in the sense that I was n’t hungry in the morning and preferred to eat later in the day and evening .
Yet I forced myself to eat breakfast on every diet attempt I made until a few years ago .
I believed breakfast was absolutely crucial for a few different reasons .
First , sleeping supposedly leaves your muscles without a steady supply of amino acids for several hours , making breakfast crucial to keep your muscles from falling off .
Second , my poor fragile metabolism apparently could n’t handle a few hours without food before completely shutting down .
And third , breakfast - eaters were on average healthier and weighed less than breakfast - skippers so there had to be something good about it , right ?
One day I looked into all of this — the actual studies that is , and not what I had learned through fitness magazines and supplement ads .
Guess what ?
All of those claims about the healthiness of breakfast , muscle catabolism and metabolic rate were wrong .
I ’ve written a lot about this topic on my blog , but let me provide the main points .
Your metabolism does n’t scavenge amino acids from your muscles after an overnight fast .
Fatty acid metabolism is highly up - regulated , but muscle catabolism does n’t occur in short - term fasting for up to 24 hours .
If you ’re still paranoid about this ( I am ) , make sure to eat some slowly absorbed protein before bed , such as cottage cheese , egg white protein or meat with veggies ( the extra fiber will slow absorption as meat is generally considered a “ fast ” protein ) .
Another thing to keep in mind is the very slow absorption rate of whole food proteins .
We ’re talking a few grams per hour , which means that a mixed meal with 40 - 50 grams of protein will maintain a steady level of amino acids in your bloodstream well through the night and into the next day .
The belief that a few hours without food will cause muscle catabolism is absurd .
Metabolic rate does not slow down during short - term fasting .
It actually increases slightly .
That ’s probably the complete opposite from what you ’ve heard , but this is an undisputed fact .
It takes more than three days without food before metabolic rate is negatively affected via down - regulation of thyroid activity .
That skipping breakfast or missing a meal affects metabolic rate , a myth still propagated in the fitness and health community , is ludicrous .
What about those studies showing breakfast is healthy and people that eat breakfast weigh less than breakfast - skippers ?
Those are all correlational studies .
Skipping breakfast is connected to a certain dysregulated eating behavior that predisposes people to weigh more .
The Average Joe or Jane breakfast - skipper is the personality type to grab a donut on the way to work , eat junk food for lunch and finish the day off with a big dinner and snack in front of the TV .
Those studies have no relevance to the conscious dieter that skips breakfast as a fat loss strategy .
Summary
Did you see the red line with regards to what foods should be ditched from your fat loss diet in order to optimize it ?
Chew your calories .
Generally speaking , the more chewing resistance a food provides , the slower the digestion will be and the longer and faster you ’ll stay satisfied and full .
Do n’t half - ass your calories with calorie - dense snacks and shakes .
Another factor to consider with snacks and shakes is the appetite stimulating effect they have on some people .
A new study shows that , if the choice stands between three big meals and six small meals , three meals come out on top with regards to appetite control .
Three meals is also a meal frequency that I have favored for years .
Invest some time in your meals and eat less frequently .
Ditch the snacks and shakes in between meals .
Do n’t let dogma or false beliefs dictate your meal frequency .
Choose a meal frequency completely based on personal preferences .
That was the lesson I wanted to teach through with my tale of skipping breakfast .
If you never were a breakfast - eater like me , skip breakfast and eat later in the day .
You can have lunch , dinner and an evening meal .
Or whatever other eating pattern that lets you adhere the best to your diet .

The company that owns the rig that exploded , Transocean Ltd. , said most crew members are safe .
" A substantial majority of the 126 member crew is safe but some crew members remain unaccounted for at this time , " the company said in a statement .
The company describes itself as the " world 's largest offshore drilling contractor and the leading provider of drilling management services worldwide " and says it has 140 offshore drilling units .
[ Posted at 7:04 a.m. ]
At least 11 people were missing and seven were critically injured after an explosion on an offshore oil rig 52 miles southeast of Venice , Louisiana , in the Gulf of Mexico , the U.S. Coast Guard said Wednesday .
At the time of the explosion Tuesday night , there were 126 people on board the rig , said Coast Guard Senior Chief Petty Officer Mike O'Berry .
Four helicopters and four Coast Guard vessels were in the area searching for the missing people , he said .
NASHVILLE , Tenn . -- Myron Rolle is n't sure how much his decision to leave football and take advantage of his Rhodes scholarship to study in Oxford cost him .
Rolle does know those who question his commitment to football are way off base .
" I sacrificed a lot in my Rhodes scholarship experience to stay in shape , make sure I was ready and pride myself for this exact moment , " Rolle said Saturday after the Tennessee Titans grabbed him with the final pick in the sixth round .
" Where my classmates were drinking at the pubs at 1:30 in the morning or traveling to different parts of the EU , I was working out , training , going to sleep , resting my body , making sure I was ready to compete .
I love this game .
I love this sport , and I want it to be my vocation for the next 10 years . "
The 6 - foot - 2 , 215 - pound Rolle finished his undergraduate degree in pre-med in 2 ½ years , then took off from football in 2009 to study in Oxford .
He entered the draft and waited to hear his name until the Titans called and used the 207th pick overall on him .
Rolle noted his strength coach , Tom Shaw , gave him a two - hour workout that he and his brother followed six days a week between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. to keep himself in shape .
He also worked with a rugby team and returned in mid-December to start preparing for his return to football at the Senior Bowl in January and the NFL Combine in February .
He said he listened to the advice of former Rhodes scholars and top athletes like Hall of Fame basketball player Bill Bradley not to eat or drink too much while in Oxford .
He had 62 tackles with five passes deflected in 2008 when he was a third - team All - American , and he also started 35 of 38 games at Florida State before passing up his final year of eligibility because he wants to become a neurosurgeon .
Rolle noted he improved his 40 - meter time from as high as 4.68 seconds at the combine to between 4.48 to 4.54 seconds at his pro day .
" My times improved when I had a second chance to do it , " Rolle said .
So how much did his year off to study hurt him ?
Rolle said he did n't expect to go Thursday with a small chance to go late Friday night in the third round .
He did n't expect to wait as long as he did Saturday before receiving a call .
Rolle learned he finally had been picked while texting with distant cousin and former NFL cornerback Samari Rolle , who started his career in Tennessee .
Rolle said he had visited his cousin while Samari still played for Tennessee but had not heard from the team before Titans coach Jeff Fisher called with the news Saturday .
" We 'd love to see what the draft process is like in the back war rooms as teams , what they 're looking at , how they 're evaluating players , " Rolle said .
" Obviously , the Titans have noticed my ability and see that I 'm special , and I 'm certainly ready to compete and help the franchise anyway I can . "
ANN ARBOR , Mich . --
When doctors become invested in an outpatient surgery center , they perform on average twice as many surgeries as doctors with no such financial stake , according to a new study from the University of Michigan Health System .
" Our data suggest that physician behavior changes after investment in an outpatient facility .
Through what some have labeled the ' triple dip , ' physician owners of surgery centers not only collect a professional fee for the services provided , but also share in their facility 's profits and the increased value of their investment .
This creates a potential conflict of interest , " says study author John Hollingsworth , M.D. , M.S. , a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar at the U - M Medical School .
" To the extent that owners are motivated by profit , one potential explanation for our findings is that these physicians may be lowering their thresholds for treating patients with these common outpatient procedures , " Hollingsworth adds .
The study looked at all patients in Florida who underwent one of five common outpatient procedures : carpal tunnel release , cataract excision , colonoscopy , knee arthroscopy and myringotomy with tympanostomy tube placement ( a procedure to insert tubes in the ear ) .
The researchers determined which doctors were owners of a surgery center .
They then compared surgery use among owners in two time periods -- before and after they acquired ownership -- with that of physicians who remained non-owners .
Results of the study appear in the April issue of Health Affairs .
The findings include :
Owners operated on an average of twice as many patients as non-owners .
While caseloads increased overall between the earlier and later time periods for all physicians , the increases were more rapid and dramatic among owners .
The number of surgery centers has increased nearly 50 percent over the last decade , largely driven by the investment of physicians , who had a stake in 83 percent of these facilities .
For doctors , investment may give them more control over their practice environment , from scheduling cases to purchasing surgical equipment .
For patients , these centers often have shorter wait times than hospitals and may provide more amenities .
" There are some definite advantages for surgeons , as well as patients , associated with care at surgery centers .
However , we need to better understand the implications of these new findings , in particular their overall effect on health care expenditures .
Insofar as our results are due to lowered treatment thresholds , policymakers should consider , at the very least , requiring all physicians to disclose their financial interests to their patients , " Hollingsworth says .

In a plan that gladdens the hearts of cycling advocates — and mayoral hopeful Rocco Rossi calls “ sheer madness ” — city hall is looking at building European - style bike lanes along University Ave. this summer .
The three - month pilot project will see two lanes — one northbound , one southbound — –removed from Richmond St. W. to Wellesley St. W./ Hoskin Ave .
Cyclists will get their own lane alongside the inner median , separated from motorized traffic by a metre - wide buffer and solid dividing posts .
Parking wo n’t be affected .
These protected lanes would be the first of their kind in the city ’s history , said Councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker , who chairs the public works and infrastructure committee .
If successful , the University project could pave the way for similar dedicated bike lane construction along other routes , such as Jarvis St. and Dundas St. W. , he said .
“ We ’ve thought about it a lot .
We ’ve talked about it a lot .
And this is the first experiment , ” said De Baeremaeker , whose committee will vote on the proposal next week .
“ People are n’t willing to risk their lives to ride their bike to work .
If we can create separate bike lanes where the cyclists feel safe ( and ) the motorists feel comfortable ... we could get thousands of people out of their vehicles and onto their bikes . ”
If the proposal gets approval from public works , which De Baeremaeker predicts it will , council will vote on the issue next month .
Not surprisingly , Rossi quickly made a statement denouncing the plans .
“ Pulling two lanes of University Ave. out of commission ... is sheer madness , ” he said .
“ This is a recipe for traffic gridlock and a democratic insult to the people of Toronto . ”
The issue of bike lanes has already become important in the fall election campaign .
On one side , Rossi has loudly voiced his opposition to bike lanes on major routes such as Jarvis St. and University Ave .
On the other , deputy mayor Joe Pantalone has been a strong advocate .
Rossi has asked Mayor David Miller to stop bike lane expansion and let voters decide this fall .
The idea scored high marks from cyclist Cyndy Dunn , as she pulled up to Queen and University Tuesday afternoon .
“ University Ave is terrifying .
Buses pass by with , literally , a foot of room , ” said the 50 - year - old lab technician .
“ I have all the safety gear you can imagine — lights on my helmet , backpack , reflective gear , a bell , a rear - view mirror ( on my helmet ) and I ’m still scared I ’m going to get die . ”
Motorist Michael Hall , on the other hand , thinks the proposal is crazy .
“ I think we have to accommodate bike lanes , but why here ? ” asked the 50 - year - old , who commutes downtown for work .
“ It ’s the same thing with Jarvis . ”
Cost details are still being worked out , but Daniel Egan , manager of pedestrian and cycling infrastructure for the city , estimates the project will cost between $ 30,000 and $ 40,000 .
“ We were looking for a place where we could really try something significantly different , ” he said .
“ ( University ) is one of the few streets that has four lanes in each direction . ”
Early studies showed there was an “ excess capacity ” of cars along the avenue , said Egan , so the lost lane should n’t cause significant delays .
Councillor Adam Vaughan , whose downtown ward runs right along University , said he ’s interested to see the project ’s impact .
“ If it works , it works , and if it does n’t work , it does n’t .
This is a couple months of trying something to see if we ca n’t unlock some potential on one of our wider streets , ” he said .
“ If it ’s a crazy idea , we can rescind it .
If it ’s great , we can make it more permanent . ”

Other recommendations for new bike lanes include added routes along — among others — Bay Street , from Queens Quay to Front St. W. and from Dundas St. W. to College St. ; Lansdowne Ave. , from Bloor St. W. to Dupont St. ; Rathburn Rd. from Mimico Creek to Kipling Ave. ; Spadina Cres. from Spadina Ave. to Spadina Ave. N. ; York Mills Rd. from Scarsdale Rd. to Lesmill Rd. ; and Westhumber Blvd. , from Martin Grove Rd. to Kipling Ave .
Last February , the city announced it would move ahead with controversial plans to put bike lanes along Jarvis St. while removing the centre reversible vehicle lane .
Rossi has said that if elected , he would remove this , and any other new lanes , installed along major routes .
New bike lanes recommended
Bay St. , from Queens Quay to Front St. W. , and from Dundas St. W. to College St .
Landsdowne Ave. , from Bloor St. W. to Dupont St .
Rathburn Rd. , from Mimico Creek to Kipling Ave .
Spadina Cres. , from Spadina Ave. to Spadina Ave . N .
York Mills Rd. , from Scarsdale Rd. to Lesmill Rd .
Westhumber Blvd. , from Martin Grove Rd. to Kipling Ave .
Brunswick Ave. , from College St. to Bloor St. W. ( further community consultation needed )
Modifications to existing lane on Annette St. between Runnymede Rd. and Westholme Ave. and between Beresford Ave. and Runnymede Rd. to provide additional parking .
It seems like a done deal .
You get to try the product before you buy , and there ’s a money - back guarantee if you buy .
If you are n’t satisfied , then all money will be returned .
But , the last laugh seems to be for the seller .
For he knows that the product will always satisfy .
So , he never has to give any money back .
He has the perfect product .
At least theoretically , the Book of Mormon is designed to operate in the same way .
Read it ; you ’ll like it .
Or so it goes .
And yet …it does n’t always work out .
Moroni’s Promise … the famous section of the Book of Mormon present in Moroni 10 : 3 - 5 … invites us to ask God , after we have read the words in the Book of Mormon , if these words are n’t true .
According to Moroni ( and the church ) , the Holy Ghost will manifest the truth of the Book of Mormon to us .
Yet … this does n’t always happen .
So , the question is :
Why does n’t Moroni ’s Promise work for everyone ?
Now , I ’m sure ex-mormons , nonMormons , and neverMormons have some particular answers for this question … but the other day , I was browsing LDS. net to see some faithful members ’ responses .
I was intrigued by the diversity of opinion .
The original poster of the topic that asked the question had her own proposed answer .
She expressed it through a quotation of Orson F. Whitney ( through Ezra Taft Benson … so apparently this quotation has relatively recent and relatively not - so - recent support ) :
“ Perhaps the Lord needs such men on the outside of His Church to help it along .
They are among its auxiliaries , and can do more good for the cause where the Lord has placed them , than anywhere else . …
Hence , some are drawn into the fold and receive a testimony of the truth ; while others remain unconverted … the beauties and glories of the gospel being veiled temporarily from their view , for a wise purpose .
The Lord will open their eyes in His own due time .
God is using more than one people for the accomplishment of His great and marvelous work .
The Latter - day Saints can not do it all .
It is too vast , too arduous for any one people . …
We have no quarrel with the Gentiles .
They are our partners in a certain sense . ”
So , in other words , some people are n’t convinced by the Book of Mormon because they are n’t meant to be .
They have anothe role , another purpose .
It ’s All God ’s Plan ( TM ) .

The Jack Clause for this same idea with one of our favorite commenters , Jack .
The interesting thing about this answer is that it truly highlights God ’s sovereignty .
Now , I ’m sure many believers talk about God ’s sovereignty , but until recently ( with my brush - ins with our Calvinist commenter , ChristianClarityReview ) , I had n’t taken another look at how far it could go .
CCR ’s contention was that free will was a hoax .
An illusion .
A deception .
This obviously does n’t work very well for Mormonism , which places free will highly in the plan of salvation and other theological frameworks .
So , how could this comment remind me of CCR ?
Well , from reading more about calvinism , it seemed to me that most Calvinists ( the non - CCR kind ) have a view that could accept some kinds of free will … but not others .
Humans have free will in the sense that we can choose actions .
However , we do n’t have free will in the sense that our choices are bound by our nature .
Since our nature is depraved , fallen , and sinful , our actions and inclinations will be to sin .
As a result , we cannot freely and neutrally choose to defy our nature … rather , we need something or someone to rewrite our nature so that we can make different choices .
That something or someone is God , the Calvinist would say .
Whitney ’s quote expresses the same sentiments , but it masks the principal agent ( that is , God ) somewhat through passive voice .
Whitney says that “ some are drawn . ”
Who does the drawing ?
God .
Others remain unconverted …why ?
God .
And who will unveil at the right time ?
Whitney explicitly states this one : it is the Lord .
God is at the helm .
Etc. , etc. ,
… so , mystery solved , right ?
Well … you did n’t really think that would be the case , did you ?
What was interesting was how others came and offered different explanations .
Their explanations redirected the “ blame ” from God and moved it elsewhere … that is , to the individuals themselves .
Many of the others defended Moroni ’s Promise , saying that God never fails on his part .
However , the human part of the promise is a bit more involved than is commonly thought :
Because Moroni ’s promise involves more than “ read and pray about it ” .
That ’s a gross simplification of the actual promise .
…
1- receive these things
2- ask God if these things are not true
3 - in the name of Christ
4 - ask with a sincere heart
5- with real intent
6- having faith in Christ
If you have all six of those things , then ‘he will manifest the truth of it unto you , by the power of the Holy Ghost ’ .
So , if you ’ve done these 6 things , then it ’s guaranteed .
God will manifest the truth of the BoM to you .
Another poster raised an interesting point in interpretation :
The last one is probably the most difficult for many people .
The BoM assumes that the reader is already a Christian .
For anyone else , the promise is n’t a lot of use ; it would be like telling a Christian he could get a testimony of the truth of the Koran by praying to Allah in the name of Mohammed , and having faith in Mohammed .
But even this was a relatively tame answer .
Quickly , answers began to blame the individual ( whether an individual was blaming his former self or a hypothetical other ) .
For example ,
I think you guys are right are about a the asking with real intent , meaning that you want to be forgiven of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by those with the proper authority and receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost .
Some folks do n’t want the Church to be true because then they will have to change their lives , others doubt their ability to be true to the Church and their intent falters .
In other words … this intent part …matters .
And not only that , but it is the major human factor .
People for whom we think Moroni ’s promise has failed actually failed to utilize the promise correctly .
Maybe they do n’t want the church to be true .
Maybe they doubt their ability to follow through .
And so on .
This kind of answer , which reemphasizes human free will , can be appealing .
It meshes better with LDS ideas about choice and agency , whereas the other answer can be offputting ( one commenter suggested that such a view of God as “ manipulating the well - intentioned seekers of truth ” was “ machiavellian . ” )
At the same time , the free will response offers a more easily grasped answer .
Instead of , “ God works in mysterious ways , ” someone can say , “ You did it wrong . ”
And even if you think you ’re “ doing it right , ” people can always say , “ Well , you have to endure to the end ! ” Deferring to God ’s ways means deferring to something we do n’t necessarily have access to .
Deferring to human free will , on the other hand , allows us to defer to something we have plenty of experience with .
千葉県に土地があり家づくりを考え始めた方にとって、予算をどの程度にするか、どうやって建てたらよいのか、お悩みの方もいらっしゃると思います。予算は少ないほうが理想的です。実は、1000万円というローコストで家づくりが可能なのです。注文住宅の建築費は主に材料費と人件費、それに販売促進費で構成されており、よく見かけるCMなどを行っている住宅メーカーなどでは人件費や販売促進費が高くなることが考えられます。そこでおすすめなのが、工務店です。デザイナーさん次第で住宅メーカーに負けない素敵な家づくりが可能です。地域密着の工務店ならではの設計であればより土地のことを理解しており、ぴったりの設計をしてくれるはずです。1000万円での家づくりに最も大切なのは、会社選びということになります。
千 葉で安く家を建てるなら、会社選びが重要
千 葉で1000万円というローコストで注文住宅を建てるには、会社選びが重要です。工務店やいわゆるローコストメーカーも存在しますが、プラン次第では住宅メーカーでも安く建てることができます。住宅メーカーであれば建材の品質が保たれ、気になる耐震性や品質の不安などが減ります。家づくりに関する情報を積極的に集めて勉強し、それぞれの会社の持つメリットやデメリットを比較して、会社を決めましょう。また、ネットで簡単な登録をするだけで、複数の会社からオリジナルの提案をしてもらえるサービスもあります。間取りなども具体的に見えてくると、生活イメージもしやすいです。何社も出向いて話を聞く必要がなく、気楽に提案の違いを把握できるのでおすすめです。また条件に合った土地探しの提案もしてもらえます。
千 葉で家を持つなら、中古住宅もおすすめ
思い切って中古の家を選択肢に入れてみるのはいかがでしょうか。新築住宅の建築費用は、他の事業の影響などで職人不足気味であることから、人件費が上昇しつつあるため条件に合ったものが叶わないこともあります。古いという点ではデメリットになってしまいますが、安く中古住宅を手に入れ、リノベーションするなどして自分好みの家づくりを楽しむ方も増えています。購入価格と合わせて予算内でのリフォームやリノベーションを行えば、1000万円で家が手に入ります。新築となるとどうしても条件は限られてしまいますが、中古住宅であれば幅広い選択が可能であることも魅力です。千葉では1000万円という予算内で住宅を購入するのであれば、駅から近いなど立地条件的にも中古住宅のほうが条件は良くなります。気になるのは耐震性ですが、1981年以降の物件であれば耐震基準の見直し後のものであり安心と言えます。
For a long time now , my day job has been " theoretical physicist , " as a quick glance at my papers will confirm .
But it was not always thus !
Very few people are actually born as theoretical physicists .
When I was an undergraduate astronomy major at Villanova , I was n't thinking about quantum field theory or differential geometry ; I was working on photometric studies of variable stars .
My personal favorite star was Epsilon Aurigae , a mysterious eclipsing binary .
One of the very few stars out there that has both a Facebook page and a Twitter feed .
And now Epsilon is in the news again !
Among this star 's claims to fame is that it has the longest period of any known eclipsing binary : over 27 years .
But it 's not just about facile record - holding ; this system is truly puzzling , especially the nature of the secondary ( the thing that eclipses the primary star ) .
The basic problem is that the eclipse has a fairly flat bottom , as seen in this light curve from the previous eclipse in 1982 - 84 .
A flat - bottomed light curve is usually associated with a total eclipse ; the secondary completely blocks the light from the primary for a while .
But in this case , the spectrum of the system seemed to remain unchanged , indicating that most of the light was still coming from the primary star , even in the middle of the eclipse .
This led Huang in 1965 to propose a clever model , in which the secondary is actually a disk seen edge - on ; the eclipse is therefore not total , but the disk blocks out part of the light without emitting much of its own .
And indeed , with modern infrared telescopes we can discern the light from the secondary -- it does look like a relatively cold disk , about four astronomical units in radius , with a hot central star .
The 1982 - 84 eclipse raised a problem with Huang 's model , however .
If you look closely at that light curve above , you 'll notice that it gets brighter right near the middle .
( The gap in data is from when the star was behind the Sun and unobservable . )
Your first guess is that this is probably just a fluctuation in the in brightness of the primary star ; but it turns out that this can't be right .
The primary is indeed variable , but its color changes in lockstep with its brightness , an effect that can be measured by observing with different filters .
And the mid-eclipse brightening shows no variation in color .
It 's not due to variability in the primary ; somehow the disk is letting more light past , right during mid-eclipse .
This is where I come in , as an undergrad doing research under Ed Guinan .
For my undergraduate thesis , we tried to put together the most sensible picture we could manage of Epsilon Aurigae ; our picture has now become the consensus model .
( One difference is that we thought the primary was a supergiant , but now it appears that it 's likely to be a smaller star . )
As far as the disk is concerned , we built on a variation of Huang 's disk model , due to Wilson in 1971 .
Wilson suggested that the disk should be thin and tilted , rather than thick and edge - on , with a semi- transparent inner region .
In that case , we could imagine that the central star ( presumably holding the disk together ) could clear out a region near the center , and light passing through that hole could account for the brightening .
I wrote a simple computer program ( QuickBASIC on an IBM PC ! ) to calculate the light curve in this model , and we were able to get an extremely good fit to the data .
Here 's the killer plot from our paper , with three different models : edge - on thick disk , opaque tilted disk with a central hole , and tilted disk with a central hole surrounded by a larger semi-transparent region .
And now , it 's eclipse time again !
( I 'm getting old . )
Epsilon started going into eclipse in August 2009 , right on schedule , and the eclipse is predicted to last until May 2011 , so we 're just a bit before mid-eclipse right now .
Here 's the current light curve .
But technology has advanced quite a bit since my student years .
Nowadays , we do n't need to puzzle out the meaning of a light curve and come up with an elaborate story involving tilted disks ; we can just take pictures of the thing .
And that 's just what we did .
Under the leadership of Brian Kloppenborg and Robert Stencel at the University of Denver , we put together a proposal to observe the eclipse using CHARA , the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy .
CHARA is an array of optical telescopes on Mt. Wilson that act as an interferometer , enabling extremely high - resolution imaging of astronomical objects .
And by " we , " I do mean that I was included in the proposing team -- a little return to my roots .
My contributions to the final results were not zero , but they were small ; the lion 's share of the credit certainly goes to Brian and Bob and the rest of the team .
And our results just appeared in the form of a paper in Nature .
Unfortunately behind a paywall , but there is an extensive NSF press release .
But who cares about the words ?
The stunning things are these pictures -- you can actually see the disk begin to move across the surface of the star .
There 's even a video where you can compare a model to the actual data .
Click to embiggen .
I have to admit that , while these images are unambiguously amazing , the result is somewhat bittersweet for me .
John Monnier , another one of the team leaders , admits that he was skeptical about all this tilted - disk business ; it just seemed like a house of cards .
But I was n't skeptical for a moment , having gone through the work of trying to fit the data with various different possibilities .
The extraordinary thing to me about observational astronomy was always how you could put together an apparently baroque model of some complicated system , just on the basis of a precious few data points , and yet have some degree of confidence that you were on the right track .
Reality is very constraining .
So in some perverse sense , it almost seems like cheating to actually take pictures of the thing .
Where 's the fun in that ?
( Of course it 's a great deal of fun . )
And now we need to see what happens at mid-eclipse !
I predict we 'll be able to image that small central hole we posited many years ago .
Not at all certain about that -- I suspect the star at the center of the disk is pretty active itself , and there are probably significant variations in the opacity of the central disk region .
That 's what data are for .
I will always love being a crazy - eyed theoretical physicist , but there 's something uniquely rewarding about digging into the data and coming to an understanding of far - flung pieces of our universe .
Traceroute Using Clojure and Jpcap
Traceroute is a tool , that is used to figure out the route taken across an IP network .
It can be used to determine network problems , or determine how systems are connected to each other .
Implementing traceroute is trivial , it works by creating an ICMP Echo packet with a " time - to - live " value of one , and sending it off to its destination , every time our packet passes through a host , its TTL value is decremented by one , when a host receives a packet with a TTL of one , it will not forward the packet , instead it will discard it and send us an ICMP time exceeded message , by keeping track of these ICMP messages we can traverse the path taken by our packets , every time we receive time exceeded message , we record the IP that sent it and increment packets TTL by one and resend the message to figure out the next router on our path until , we receive ICMP echo reply message which means we have reached our destination .
This technique has some problems , not all servers responds to ICMP requests , such as the one running this site if you try to ping it you will not get a response .
Some routers also like messing with our specifically crafted TTL values .
Since I did this just as a proof of concenpt it did n't bother me , if you need real traceroute use traceroute command or whatever is its equivalent in windows .
I am going to skip some functions which I already covered in A Guide to Raw Traffic in Clojure , and go over the meat of the code .
For this example we need to create our own ICMP packets and capture traffic going through our network interface for that you need libpcap and Jpcap installed .
( ns traceroute ( :import ( java.net InetAddress URL ) ( java.util Arrays ) ( java.io BufferedReader InputStreamReader ) ( jpcap NetworkInterface JpcapCaptor JpcapSender PacketReceiver ) ( jpcap.packet EthernetPacket IPPacket ICMPPacket ) ) ) ( defn mac - byte - to - string [ mac - bytes ] ( let [ v ( apply vector ( map #( Integer / toHexString ( bit - and % 0xff ) ) mac - bytes ) ) ] ( apply str ( interpose " : " v ) ) ) ) ( defn ip v4 ? [ inet - addrs ] ( if ( instance ? java.net .
Inet4Address inet -addrs ) true false ) ) ( defn ip v4 - addrs [ addr - list ] ( filter ip v4 ?
( apply vector ( map ( fn [ i ] ( .address i ) ) addr-list ) ) ) ) ( defn device [ name ] ( first ( filter #( = name ( .name % ) ) ( JpcapCaptor / getDeviceList ) ) ) ) ( defn captor [ device ] ( JpcapCaptor / openDevice device 2000 false 5000 ) ) ( defn gateway - mac [ captor device ] ( let [ ping - addr ( InetAddress / getByName " google.com " ) conn #( -> ( URL . " http://google.com " ) .openStream .close ) ] ( conn ) ( loop [ packet ( .getPacket captor ) ] ( if ( Arrays /equals ( -> packet .datalink .dst_mac ) (.mac_address device ) ) ( -> packet .datalink .src_mac ) ( do ( conn ) ( recur ( .getPacket captor ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Even though you use IP addresses to communicate with machines on your network , computers use MAC addresses to send packets back and forth , first thing we need to do is figure out the MAC address of the gateway , we open and close a connection to google , just to create some traffic then listen for packets , if the destination MAC of the packet captured matches our network interfaces MAC , it means it is coming from the router so we grab its MAC address .
( defn icmp-packet [ device gw - mac this - ip target - ip ] ( let [ icmp ( ICMPPacket . ) ether ( EthernetPacket . ) this - ip ( cast java.net .
InetAddress this - ip ) target - ip ( cast java.net .
InetAddress target - ip ) ] ( set ! ( .type icmp ) ICMPPacket / ICMP_ECHO ) ( set ! ( .seq icmp ) 100 ) ( set ! ( .id icmp ) 0 ) ( .setIPv4 Parameter icmp 0 false false false 0 false false false 0 0 0 IPPacket / IPPROTO_ICMP this - ip target - ip ) ( set ! ( .data icmp ) ( .get Bytes " data " ) ) ;; ether ( set ! (. frametype ether ) EthernetPacket / ETHERTYPE_IP ) ( set ! ( .src_mac ether ) ( .mac_address device ) ) ( set ! ( .dst_mac ether ) gw- mac ) ;; link ( set ! ( .datalink icmp ) ether ) icmp ) )
Next step is to build the ICMP packet we will be using , an ICMP packet is made up of two parts , and Ethernet packet which will guide our packet within our network , and an ICMP packet which will be guided to the destination .
Most of the names are self explanatory but for more info you can check out ICMP Packet and Ethernet Packet on Wikipedia .
( defn inc -hop [ icmp ] ( set ! ( .hop_limit icmp ) ( inc ( .hop_limit icmp ) ) ) ) ( defn type ?
[ packet expected ] ( = ( . type packet ) expected ) ) ( defn send - icmp - batch [ sender icmp ] ( doseq [ i ( range 3 ) ] ( .sendPacket sender icmp ) ) ) ( defn add [ route icmp packet ] ( let [ host ( .getHostAddress ( .src_ip packet ) ) ] ( if - not ( route host ) ( assoc route host ( .hop_limit icmp ) ) route ) ) ) ( defn traverse [ device gw - mac captor dev-ip target - ip ] ( let [ icmp ( icmp - packet device gw - mac dev-ip target - ip ) sender ( .getJpcapSenderInstance captor ) ] ( .set Filter captor ( str " icmp and dst host " ( .getHostAddress dev-ip ) ) true ) ( send - icmp - batch sender icmp ) ( loop [ packet ( .getPacket captor ) route {} ] ( cond ( nil ? packet ) ( do ( send - icmp - batch sender icmp ) ( recur ( .getPacket captor ) route ) ) ;; ( type ? packet ICMPPacket / ICMP_TIMXCEED ) ( do ( inc - hop icmp ) ( send - icmp - batch sender icmp ) ( recur ( .get Packet captor ) ( add route icmp packet ) ) ) ;; ( type ? packet ICMPPacket / ICMP_UNREACH ) ( add route icmp packet ) ( type ? packet ICMPPacket / ICMP_ECHOREPLY ) ( add route icmp packet ) ) ) ) )
Now we have all the ingredients we need to traverse the network , we ask for a sender instance from the Jpcap library and set a filter that will only get us packets of type ICMP and destined for us .
Every time we receive a time exceeded message we record its ip and increment the hop count and send a new batch of packets , if we ever receive a reply for our request or a host unreachable message we stop sending more packets and return the route we traversed so far .
I cheated here a little bit , when I used a single ICMP packet it got lost along the way and I could not see more than 3 - 4 hops away so I started sending ICMP packets in batches of 3 even if a router does not respond I receive multiple responses from other routers along the way and increment hop count and pass the one that does not respond , down side of this technique is , a host in Turkey may show up after a host in United States which is not possible since I am running the trace from Turkey to United States .
( defn hostip - info [ ip ] ( let [ url ( URL . ( str " http://api.hostip.info/get_html.php?ip= " ip ) ) ] ( with - open [ stream ( . url ( openStream ) ) ] ( let [ buf ( BufferedReader . ( InputStreamReader . stream ) ) ] ( vec ( line - seq buf ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn map - ip - data [ route ] ( map deref ( doall ( map #( future ( hostip - info ( first % ) ) ) route ) ) ) )
A list of IP addresses is n't all that informative , but using Hostip .
info project we can locate where in the world that router is located , after running route through map - ip - data we will have a sequence of country , city , ip triples .
( defn traceroute [ device - name target - ip ] ( let [ dev ( device device - name ) dev-ip ( first ( ipv4- addrs ( .addresses dev ) ) ) cap ( captor dev ) gw- mac ( gateway - mac cap dev ) target - ip ( InetAddress / getByName target - ip ) route ( map - ip - data ( sort - by second ( traverse dev gw - mac cap dev-ip target - ip ) ) ) ] ( doseq [ [ country city ip ] route ] ( println ip "
\t " country "
\t " city ) ) ) )
( traceroute " en1 " " google.com " )
All thats left to do is piece all the components together run the trace and print the results ,

I SEE RED : George Jones wants white poppies off his patch .
War veterans are angry that Peace Movement Aotearoa is running a white poppy fundraiser just a day before the annual RSA red poppy day street appeal .
Veterans ' Affairs Minister Judith Collins said the white poppy appeal was " incredibly disrespectful to those who served their country " .
" Peace Movement Aotearoa should be ashamed of themselves , " she said .
SUPPLIED VETERAN : George Jones served in Italy during World War II .
World War II veteran George Jones , 88 , of Lower Hutt , said : " They should get off the RSA 's patch and hold their appeal at least six months away from Anzac Day .
" Red poppies pay homage to the soldiers , what they did and what they had to put up with .
" They say they 're for peace , but doing it the day before our day is picking a fight . "
Mr Jones was a signaller in the New Zealand Division in the Italian campaign from 1943 - 45 .
" They 're being cheeky – there will be hundreds of guys who are not happy with this . "
Royal New Zealand Returned and Services ' Association chief executive Stephen Clarke said the organisation was concerned at the intrusion .
Red poppies had been sold every year since 1922 to raise money for veterans ' welfare services .
It raised $ 1.4 million last year .
It was a clear case of " trading off " on the red poppy brand , Mr Clarke said .
However , PMA co-ordinator Edwina Hughes defended its white poppy appeal and the timing .
Her organisation was not competing with the RSA .
There was nothing to stop people wearing red and white poppies together .
" The red poppy is the symbol of remembrance for armed forces casualties where the white poppy is for all victims of war .
" The white poppy is a long - standing international symbol of remembrance and peace and we wanted to have it around Anzac Day because that 's the day that 's most appropriate for New Zealand . "
Last year it raised about $ 5000 , enough for three scholarships .
All money collected in the appeal was going to peace scholarships , which were available to assist research on " the impacts of militarism , militarisation and warfare ; alternatives to militarism , warfare , or collective non-violent responses to state violence " .
One of the first scholarships was awarded to Victoria University student Marianne Bevan to fund a visit to East Timor to study militarisation , violence and gender issues in the country 's recently established police force .
The UK’s National Health Service has been hit by a voracious , data - stealing worm that ’s easily detected by off - the - shelf security software , according to researchers who directly observed the mass compromise .
Researchers from anti-virus provider Symantec have been monitoring the Qakbot worm since last May and have documented its behavior here and here .
On Thursday , after infiltrating two of the six servers used to collect pilfered data from infected machines , they provided an update that did n't exactly instill confidence in the healthcare system .
“ The logs show that there is a significant Qakbot infection on the National Health Service ( NHS ) network in the UK , ” the Symantec update states .
“ This threat has managed to infect over 1,100 separate computers that are spread across multiple subnets within the NHS .
We have attempted to contact the affected parties and have no evidence to show that any customer or patient data has been stolen . ”
Not that Qakbot does n’t have the ability to clean out the NHS if it wanted to .
Over a two week period , the researchers observed 4 GB of stolen data being funneled to the monitored servers .
Because that represents a fraction of the servers used by Qakbot , the amount of pilfered information is likely much higher .
Qakbot spreads through webpages that install malware by exploiting patched vulnerabilities in Microsoft ’s Internet Explorer and Apple ’s QuickTime software .
It is able to self - propagate on local networks through file shares .
It “ moves slowly and with caution , trying not to bring attention to its presence , ” according to the update .
The malware scours an infected machine ’s hard drive for internet search histories , banking and payment card information and logon credentials for some dozen websites and then uploads them to one of the six servers .
It also records the contents of data stored by a browser ’s autocomplete feature .
“ In a nutshell , if your computer is compromised , every bit of information you type into your browser will be stolen , ” Symantec researchers wrote .
While Qakbot primarily targets home users , plenty of corporate and government machines are infected as well .
In addition to the NHS , other government computers that are compromised are located in Brazil .
The threat is easily detected by Symantec ’s anti-virus product , and presumably software from plenty of other companies as well . ®

One main goal in the renewable energy field is to find an efficient , inexpensive way to split water into hydrogen and oxygen .
The hydrogen could then be used as a fuel source for vehicles or fuel cells .
Typically , an electric current breaks the water down .
Now , there ’s a new water - splitter : a virus .
M.I.T. ’s Angela Belcher took her cue from plants , where special pigments capture solar energy in photosynthesis , involving the splitting of water .
Belcher and her team took a harmless virus called M13 .
They engineered it so that one end carries a catalyst — iridium oxide .
Bound at the other end are light - sensitive pigments , zinc porphyrins .
The porphyrins capture light energy , and transmit it along the virus , acting as a wire , to the other end , activating the catalyst .
Which splits water into oxygen and the constituents of hydrogen , a proton and electron .
The work appears in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
[ See http://bit.ly/aP4HCN]
The scientists are working on ways to recombine the protons and electrons back into hydrogen atoms and then molecules of H2 .
They ’re also seeking a cheaper catalyst than iridium .
But the work could light one path to the eventual production of cleaner energy .

Members of the military stand outside of the White House in Washington D.C. to protest ' Do n't Ask , Don't Tell . '
Get over gay fear , U.S. allies advise
As openly gay officers with decades of combined service experience in the British , Dutch and Swedish armed forces , we are closely watching U.S. developments around the repeal of " Do n't ask , do n't tell . "
We were just in Washington at a Brookings Institution / Palm Center conference , where representatives from the world 's militaries discussed this matter .
Advertisement
Though we maintain a respect for the American people , their military and their political process , we share a sense of puzzlement — and a sort of shock — at the rhetoric we heard surrounding " Do n't ask , do n't tell . "
As Congress prepares to vote on this , we hope our international perspective can be of some value .
The U.S. armed forces are the world 's most formidable , with an unrivaled might and a readiness to accept worldwide deployments to engage in a range of military conflicts that no other nation views with the same sort of international responsibility .
Yet it is also true that U.S. military power depends , in most cases , on an international coalition of partners .
Members of Congress do n't always seem to appreciate that America 's allies are put off in serious ways by the " Do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
For example , units of our own or other armed forces have refused to deploy in some joint operations with U.S. forces because gay service members would not work with the Americans — for fear of hostile reactions .
In addition to protecting our men and women from enemy combatants , we must also protect them from anti-gay and anti-lesbian discrimination .
Increasingly , this is not a situation we and our personnel will tolerate .
So we are less able to help accomplish our collective missions .
We are aware of colleagues in our own militaries who do n't like it that gays and lesbians serve openly .
However , despite considerable fears before we enacted these policies , such attitudes are rare .
In no cases , in fact , have negative private opinions about gay people undermined our ability to work with one another .
Our service members are professionals who care , first and foremost , about the ability to do the job .
Moral opposition to homosexuality , while real , is just not allowed to undercut our militaries ' missions .
Nor do we think it will have any impact on yours after you repeal " Do n't ask , do n't tell . "
This is an important point because many Americans seem to believe that ending anti-gay discrimination in European and Israeli militaries faced no resistance because our cultures are more tolerant .
In fact , our polls , rhetoric and even threats of mass resignations were quite similar to the continuing resistance in America .
Yet none of the doomsday scenarios came true .
According to research and assessments of our transitions , the new policies had no negative impact on military readiness .
Another dimension missing from the congressional debate is how the closet harms gay troops .
We know this from personal experience .
Unit cohesion is paramount , and that 's why the public debate about " Do n't ask , do n't tell " has focused on this topic .
But the impact of discrimination on gay troops matters as well — and we have not heard members of Congress discuss this .
Each of us has experienced what it means to have to live a lie .
Enforced silence has undermined our well - being , readiness and ability to do our job .
If you want your gay and lesbian troops operating at 100 percent , you cannot force them into isolation and dishonesty on a daily basis .
We are also puzzled about repeated claims we heard in Washington about the need for more research on " Do n't ask , do n't tell . "
There is more than enough on - the - ground experience , as well as serious social science research , showing what will happen when the U.S. military allow gays and lesbians to utter the words " I am gay " without getting fired .
We are confident that , despite the unique nature of each culture and military , you will have a similar experience to ours — which is that ending discrimination against gay troops was a giant nothing .
Washington must project force like no other nation .
But the military is also about projecting values — and the discriminatory " Do n't ask , do n't tell " policy undercuts America 's commitment to the democratic values of fairness and equality under the law .
The policy puts you in the company of Iran , North Korea , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , China and Yemen .
Is that the kind of company you want to keep ?

I 'm not quite old as dirt , but I remember the very first Earth Day .
On April 22 , 1970 the day was celebrated as a call to action , a challenge to change .
Back then the double - C words had n't really entered our consciousness , the situation was drastic but not dire .
Problems like pollution and overpopulation loomed large but not without solutions .
The mood was purposeful yet hopeful .
Now in the face of climate change , and all that entails , including huge unknowns ; the concept of Earth Day seems so sweet and quaint and almost antiquated .
The issues today are complicated and intricately interconnected .
It 's hard not to feel that any effort is futile .
When the issues include food and water scarcities , epidemics , energy shortages , economic uncertainty , erratic weather , wars , etc , etc ; swapping out light bulbs seems like just so much spitting in the wind .
Overwhelmed with it all , I plant a garden .
I try to provide food and shelter for the birds and insects that will in turn feed bigger things .
And then I hope others do the same forming a survival corridor through the land .
I try to live smaller , I try to live mindfully .
But it never seems enough .
In 1970 I was an eighth - grade student on the school newspaper staff .
Our advisor was Minnie Surles .
Once upon a time she wrote a column called Minnie 's - Ha - Ha's .
Now that I live near Minnehaha Creek , I often think of her .
I remember that as we put the April 1970 issue of The Road Runner to bed , we had some space left on one page .
Mrs. Surles told me to add a filler , so I inserted a few words into a little box at the bottom of the page .
It read : " Make Every Day Earth Day " .
If only we could .
The landscape after Pinatubo ’s eruption may give a glimpse of what early humans experienced ( Image : Sipa Press / Rex Features )

The biggest bangs in history
THE first sign that something had gone terribly wrong was a deep rumbling roar .
Hours later the choking ash arrived , falling like snow in a relentless storm that raged for over two weeks .
Despite being more than 2000 kilometres from the eruption , hominins living as far away as eastern India would have felt Toba ’s fury .
Toba is a supervolcano on the Indonesian island of Sumatra .
It has blown its top many times but this eruption , 74,000 years ago , was exceptional .
Releasing 2500 cubic kilometres of magma – nearly twice the volume of mount Everest – the eruption was more than 5000 times as large as the 1980 eruption of mount St Helens in the US , making it the largest eruption on Earth in the last 2 million years ( see “ Blown away ” ) .
The disaster is particularly significant since it occurred at a crucial period in human prehistory – when Neanderthals and other hominins roamed much of Asia and Europe , and around the time our direct ancestors , Homo sapiens , were first leaving Africa to ultimately conquer the world .
Yet with no recent eruptions for easy comparison , the full extent of its fallout and impact on early humans has been shrouded in mystery .
Now dramatic finds from archaeological digs in India , presented in February at a conference at the University of Oxford , are finally clarifying the picture of the eruption and its effects , and how it shaped human evolution and migration .
Further results from the digs may …
Dirty washrooms , drivers who take breaks while riders cool their heels , bunching on bus routes and drivers who fail to open the door at some stops — the complaints about TTC service were n’t new .
But Wednesday was the first time the TTC ’s customer service advisory panel heard them face - to - face with riders .
Seven panelists , including hotelier Steve O’Brien , who chairs the volunteer committee , went to the Bloor subway station to solicit comments and ideas from riders who have n’t forgotten the token hoarding and pictures of a sleeping subway collector that have battered the TTC ’s reputation in recent months .
After more than two months of learning about TTC operations , O’Brien said it ’s clear communication is the biggest issue in improving the transit experience .
“ Some of the systems the TTC has to communicate with are somewhat antiquated , and I know the TTC is working on upgrading systems .
But it ’s communication all the way around , and if you want to change the culture you ’ve got to improve the communication , ” he told reporters .
Many lunch - hour riders rushing to catch trains grabbed cards or chatted briefly with the panelists , who are expected to report their findings in June .
Some riders had constructive ideas .
One suggested the TTC put signs on buses when they ’re too full to carry more passengers , so those who are bypassed understand .
Others used the first in the series of subway meetings to vent .
Dufferin bus rider Sharon Susin said she was frustrated by buses that arrive three at a time and by drivers who pretend not to see riders running to board .
“ I do n’t understand why they ca n’t separate the buses more .
They all come in ( together ) and then there ’s nobody , ” she said .
Driver coffee breaks were another source of irritation for Susin .
“ I ’m sitting in the bus and I ’ve got to get to work and another bus passes us while we ’re still waiting for the bus driver to come from getting his coffee .
That makes us passengers angry — rightly so .
I do understand they need their coffee breaks but it should be done in a way that ’s not inconveniencing passengers , ” she said .
Rider Philip
Roy said he was concerned about the safety of seniors and children on the subway during rush hour .
“ There ’s the gap .
People will trip and I ’ve seen that happen so many times .
Even though they say , ‘ Do n’t hold the door open , ’ I have to when I see somebody trying to get in , ” he said .
Roy said the passenger alarm strips should be lowered , following an incident earlier this week in which a senior was mugged on the train and could n’t reach the yellow strip to summon help .
“ It ’s about time you guys started looking at that , ” said Bob Sabb , when he was offered a customer service comment card by Robert Culling , the sole TTC employee on the panel .
“ How does York Region ( transit ) stack up against TTC as far as general service ? ” Culling asked Sabb , who lives in Richmond Hill .

Weather experts predicted Friday that a volcanic ash causing chaos to air traffic across Europe would affect the region well into the weekend and possibly beyond as the dust cloud continued to spread .
Scientists said it was too soon to predict when the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland would cease spewing ash , raising the prospect of thousands more grounded flights in coming days .
Prevailing westerly winds are expected to fan the massive plume of dust from an erupting volcano in Iceland further east and north , according to predictions from the London Ash Advisory Center .
By 07:00 GMT Saturday ( 7 p.m. ET ) the cloud traveling at up to 9,000 meters ( 30,000 feet ) is forecast to be covering parts of Russia , Poland , Finland and other East European countries while continuing to affect the UK , Sweden , Norway , Germany , Denmark and Netherlands .
Volcanic ash still causing travel chaos
Northern parts of Sweden , the UK , and Ireland , which have begun to reinstate air flights , would remain in the clear for the time being , according to forecasts .
CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said upper - level winds will remain largely from the same direction , from the North and West , over the next 40 hours , bringing ash from the volcano into northern Europe .
" We expect the speed of the winds to decrease over Iceland and the North Sea , however , which could limit the distance the plume will travel , as well as limit the concentration of the ash if and when it reaches mainland Europe , " he said .
He said if the volcano in Iceland volcano continues to spew ash at the same rate , disruption would continue .
If the ash ejections lessen combined with weakening winds , conditions could improve through the weekend
The UK's Met Office said Eyjafjallajökull was now releasing ash in " pulses " rather than a steady plume , but scientists say it is too early to predict how long the eruption would last .
The volcano 's last major eruption in 1821 lasted for two years .
Professor Peter Sammonds of University College London 's geophysics department said it would be possible to determine the expected duration of the eruption once data is gathered , although conditions around the volcano were currently hampering this .

" The reason it 's going through quite a fierce phase at the moment is because ice is melting and water is mixing with magma causing it to fragment , " he told CNN .
" This will go on until the water supply runs out , which could be quite some time . "
Although the Ash Advisory Center models cloud movements for up to 10 days ahead , it was restricting its public forecasts to the next 24 hours , so it was unclear what areas the dust would be affected into Sunday and the following week .
Although the ash cloud -- made up of tiny particles of volcanic matter held in suspension -- is moving relatively high in the atmosphere , meteorologists said there were signs some dust was settling at lower levels .
The Met Office said it had received recordings of dust in the air at Lerwick in Scotland and in Bedfordshire , northeast of London .
There were also reports of dust settling on parked vehicles in some parts of the UK , it said .
CNN 's Miller says , with no major storm system on the horizon , the prevailing winds would continue to dictate movement .
" The volcanic ash is transported primarily by upper - level winds , " Miller said .
" Once the ash is ejected into the atmosphere by the volcano , the only real forces acting on it are gravity and wind . "
Travelers rush to trains and ferries
" This fine volcanic ash can rise extremely high in the atmosphere , up to 50,000 feet , where planes cannot fly over them , " Miller said .
" At this height , the winds can be very strong and can therefore transport the plume of fine ash several hundred miles . "
Miller said the dispersion of the cloud will make it less dangerous as it travels .
It 's very unlikely that United States skies would be affected , but northern Europe may not be out of the dark soon .
" The other problem is that the volcano is still erupting and still transmitting the ash into the atmosphere , " Miller said .
" As long as the volcano is erupting , the ash will continue being transported by the wind , and flight disruption will continue . "

If you wonder why more and more doctors prescribe drugs electronically , ask Catherine Hoagland .
The Portland woman was jailed for several hours on Monday when she tried to help her nephew by filling a prescription at a local Rite - Aid .
Officers thought the prescription was faked .
It was n't .
Instead , Hoagland was derailed by a series of errors , including one that 's almost a punch line : Bad doctor handwriting .
" The gist of it is , the practitioner , her name was not legible , " said Lisa Vance , chief executive of
, where Hoagland 's nephew was treated .
" We feel terrible , actually mortified , at the fact that this poor woman was questioned and detained about this . "
Like many errors in medicine , and life , several small failures collided in a busy , distracting environment .
Hoagland 's sister , Hope Arias , took her 19 - year - old son Andrew Chandler to the ER with intense pain and a face swollen from an infected tooth .
Doctors prescribed an antibiotic and pain killer in easy - to - swallow liquid form .
But those elixirs must be hand - made and are expensive -- roughly $ 300 , Arias said .
When Arias went back to get prescriptions for cheaper pills , a nurse practitioner paused in the busy ER to help .
Three things went wrong :
The practitioner 's signature was unreadable .
She mixed up digits in the federal registration number doctors need to prescribe narcotics .
And the new prescription was n't immediately logged into the patient record .
" It was human error , " Vance said .
Since Arias is disabled , Hoagland went to fetch the medicine .
Pharmacists questioned the prescription and phoned the hospital , faxing over a copy .
A nurse found no record of the number or prescription and could n't read the practitioner 's name , so the pharmacy called the sheriff .
Hoagland was smoking outside the pharmacy when officers came to handcuff her .
She was booked into jail for tampering with drug records , given a small brown sack lunch and one phone call .
Bail was set at $ 750 .
" It was stressful , " Hoagland said .
" I 've never been arrested before in my life . "
Arias , officers and the hospital figured out the problem , and Hoagland was released several hours later .
Charges were dropped Thursday .
Vance said Providence is offering to help Hoagland have the arrest expunged from her record , to pay for Chandler 's care and help him get the dental work he needs .
Providence is working on steps to prevent such errors , Vance said .
The ultimate solution may be replacing paper pads with electronic prescriptions .
While the ER still uses paper pads , Vance said , about 85 percent of Providence Portland 's inpatient system is electronic and the whole hospital hopes to use " eScripts " by next year .
Those prescriptions do n't have handwriting and are automatically recorded .
Other doctors and hospitals are moving toward electronic prescribing , and the government has offered stimulus money to help fund those changes .
Studies show electronic prescriptions often reduce errors , though they may add a few new kinds of mistakes , depending on the systems ' design .
For instance , doctors may click the wrong item in systems with drop - down menus .
" I 'm so sorry to the aunt , " Vance said .
" This should not have happened and we are working to make sure this does n't happen again . "
A team of surgeons has carried out the world 's first full - face transplant on a young Spanish farmer unable to breathe or eat on his own since accidentally shooting himself in the face five years ago .
It was the most extensive operation yet and the 11th known face transplant worldwide .
During the 24 - hour surgery , doctors lifted an entire face , including jaw , nose , cheekbones , muscles , teeth and eyelids , and placed it masklike onto the man , Dr. Joan Pere Barret said Friday .
Transplant experts hailed the surgery , carried out late last month at Barcelona 's Vall d'Hebron Hospital , as a significant advance .
" It is a breakthrough .
They are pushing the envelope and I am very happy for them , " said Dr. Thomas Romo , chief of facial and reconstructive surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York .
The Spanish patient , who was not identified , now has a completely new face from his hairline down and only one visible scar , which looks like a wrinkle running across his neck , said Barret , who headed the 30 - member surgical team .
The man cannot yet speak , eat or smile , but can see and swallow saliva , the surgeon said .
He is expected to be able to eat and breathe on his own in about a week .
" If you look him in the face , you see a normal person , " Barret said .
" He sits up , he walks in his hospital room and he watches television . "
Before the transplant , the 30 - year - old patient had had nine surgeries and could only breathe with the help of a ventilator and get nourishment from a feeding tube .
He also had problems speaking .
The 2005 accident , in which he shot himself with a shotgun , essentially destroyed his face from the eye sockets down , although his eyes and eyesight were unaffected .
During the daylong operation , Barret said his team cut off the donor 's face below the eye sockets and attached the bone structure along with muscles and nerves to the recipient " in one piece . "
" Imagine a skull .
It is as if with a saw , we cut everything just below the upper part of the eye sockets , as if we were sawing all that , " he said .
Then , " everything attached to the mask is placed on the recipient . "
Face transplants in the real world have gained acceptance since the first partial transplant almost five years ago in France .
Patients do n't look like the dead people whose skin and facial features they now live with .
And skeptical bioethicists and doctors groups have warmed to the idea for patients who have tried reconstructive surgery with little success .
There have been 10 partial transplants worldwide , including in the United States , China and elsewhere in Spain , but this is the first full - face transplant , Barret said .
The Spanish operation is similar to a near - total face transplant carried out by a team led by Dr. Maria Siemionow in 2008 in Cleveland , on a woman who was also shot in the face .
But the Spanish case " seems to us to be more complex , " said Neil Huband , a spokesman for the UK Facial Transplantation Research Team , based at the Royal Free Hospital in London .
Barret would give no details about the donor except to say that doctors try to choose donors of similar weight , height , facial measurements and skin tone as the recipient .
As in earlier operations , the Spanish patient had undergone psychiatric tests to determine if he would be able to confront having a totally new face , the hospital said .
Still , rejection is a possibility whenever someone receives an organ or cells from someone else because the body regards this as foreign tissue .
Rejection , which can be life - threatening , can come on suddenly , within days or weeks of the operation , or occur years later .

Internet giant Google says malicious software has been used to spy on tens of thousands of Vietnamese web users .
The company said the cyber attacks appeared to target opponents of bauxite mining in Vietnam .
Google said the malware was " damaging " but less sophisticated than recent attacks at the heart of the company 's dispute with China .
Tim Bowler reports .
During a Monday appearance on MSNBC ’s Dylan Ratigan Show , a retired intelligence officer claimed that U.S. forces violated the military ’s Rules of Engagement in events depicted by a video released by whistleblower site WikiLeaks , which allegedly shows the murder of civilians and journalists in New Baghdad , Iraq .
The Pentagon maintains that no crime was committed and no investigation will be carried out .

In the video , U.S. military personnel apparently mistook the cameras slung over the backs of two Reuters journalists for weapons when they opened fire on them and a group of people on July 12 , 2007 .
The video purportedly shows the deaths of Reuters journalists Namir Noor - Eldeen , 22 and Saeed Chmagh , 40 , along with six other people on a street corner .
It also shows US forces firing on a minivan in which two injured children were found .
“ The military did not reveal how the Reuters staff were killed , and stated that they did not know how the children were injured , ” Wikileaks states .
“ You can see , in this case we really have unique material that shows how modern aerial warfare is done , ” WikiLeaks ’ co-founder Julian Assange said , appearing on MSNBC .
“ Has n’t been revealed before .
It also shows the debasement and moral corruption of soldiers as a result of war .
It seems like they are playing video games with people ’s lives . ”
Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer , who joined Assange on the program , said that based on what he saw in the video , it appeared to be a violation of the military ’s Rules of Engagement .

“ First rule is , you may engage persons who commit hostile acts or show hostile intent by minimum force necessary , ” he said .
“ Minimum force is necessary .
If you see eight armed men , the first thing I would think as an intelligence officer is , ‘ How can we take these guys and capture them ? ’
We do n’t want to kill people arbitrarily ; we want the intel take .
“ Now , most importantly , when you see that van show up to take away the wounded , do not target or strike anyone who has surrendered or is out of combat due to sickness or wounds .
So , the wound part of that I find disturbing , being that you clearly have people down , you have people on the way there .
Speaking as an intelligence officer , my intent is to capture people , to recover them .
That is the idea here .
If you ’re not really doing that , you ’re not really doing precise combat . ”
Salon writer Glenn Greenwald , who also appeared on MSNBC to discuss the leaked video , later wrote that the footage ” is truly gruesome and difficult even for the most hardened person to watch , but it should be viewed by everyone with responsibility for what the U.S. has done in Iraq and Afghanistan ( i.e. , every American citizen ) . ”

The latest atrocity adds to the long list inflicted on Afghans since the U.S. invasion .
It adds to intuitive reactions and propaganda efforts that feed the illusion of terrorism as a virtue .
Jerome Starkey of the London Times reports to Russia Today ( 7:51 ) :
U.S. - led troops near Kandahar , Afghanistan sprayed a passenger bus with gunfire , shooting out the windows on one side , Monday morning , reportedly killing at least four civilians and wounding at least 18 .
“ If the casualty toll is correct , it would imply that troops may have fired scores of rounds , ” Richard Oppel and Taimoor Shah report at The New York Times ( NYT ) .
“ Hundreds of demonstrators poured into the area around a station where the damaged bus was taken on the western outskirts of Kandahar .
They blocked the road with burning tires for an hour and shouted ‘ Death to America ’ and ‘ Death to infidels ’ while also condemning the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , according to people in the area , ” reports the NYT .
President Karzai said , “ Opening fire on a passenger bus is an act against NATO ’s commitment to protect civilians and is by no means justifiable , ” Agence France Presse ( AFP ) reported .
The International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) Joint Command , headed by U.S. General Stanley McChrystal , released a statement shortly after the attack that the bus “ approached a slow - moving ISAF route - clearance patrol from the rear at a high rate of speed ” .
The statement claims the troops were not aware the vehicle was a passenger bus until “ upon inspection ” , after four people , including one woman , were slaughtered by them .
“ The killings were the latest deadly case of what the military calls ‘ escalation of force , ’ in which troops guarding military convoys or checkpoints gun down Afghans perceived as a threat because they have come too close or are traveling too fast , ” reports the NYT .
“ Deadly force is supposed to be used on encroaching vehicles only after warning shots , flares or other tactics . ”
“ The Kandahar governor , Tooryalai Wesa , called for the commander of the military convoy who opened fire to be prosecuted under military law , ” the NYT adds .
“ If you want to stop the bus , it should be shot in the tires , ” Mr. Wesa , who told the AFP the troops were American , said .
“ Why shoot the people inside ? ”
“ An American convoy was ahead of us and another convoy was following us , and we were going to pull off of the road , and suddenly the Americans opened fire , ” said one passenger , Nida Muhammad , who suffered a shoulder wound .
“ This bus was n’t like an a suicide bomber , and we did not touch or come close to the convoy , ” he said .
“ It seems they are opening fire on civilians intentionally . ”
Mohammed Nabi , who identified himself as the bus driver , “ said he did not violate any signal from the troops ” , adding : “ I was going to take the bus off the road ” before the troops began firing from 60 - 70 yards away .
Gen. McChrystal , in a video conference last month , told troops “ [ I ] n the nine - plus months I ’ve been here , not a single case where we have engaged in an escalation of force incident and hurt someone has it turned out that the vehicle had a suicide bomb or weapons in it and , in many cases , had families in it . ”
Extremely conservative estimates of Afghan civilian deaths by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan still made 2009 the deadliest year since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 . [ .pdf ]
Unknown causalities have resulted in the expansion of the war into Pakistan with its government collaborating .
U.S. Special Operations Forces ( S.O.F. ) “ trainers play a bigger role than has been widely disclosed in helping Pakistan ’s paramilitary Frontier Corps , ” Reuters reports today .
The number of S.O.F. trainers “ fluctuates between 60 and 120 ” with “ 200 U.S. military personnel in Pakistan , including troops who guard the sprawling American Embassy compound in Islamabad ” .
Monday , the U.N. released a statement that over 200,000 Pakistanis have been displaced in one region since U.S. - Pak aggression escalated last year and the Pakistani military killed “ nearly 100 people in air raids ” on Saturday .
“ Some 1.3 million Pakistanis have already been displaced as a result of the army ’s last year crackdown on militants in South Waziristan , ” Press TV reports today .
Unintelligent ‘ Intelligence ’ , Blowback , Stingy Bribes , Blowback
Gareth Porter at Inter Press Services reports today , “ The inability of the U.S. military to organise its own networks of reliable agents has also led to a willingness to act with lethal force on the basis of tips from dubious sources . ”
“ Civilian casualties are a source of anger among Afghans and are often used by politicians and the Taliban to whip up public opposition to the 126,000 U.S. and NATO troops based in the country ” , the AFP added today .
The Americans are constantly killing our civilians and the government is not demanding an explanation , ” Mohammad Razaq , a local resident , told Al Jazeera ( AJ ) .
“ We demand justice from the Karzai government and the punishment of those soldiers responsible . ”
Haroun Mir , a founder of the Centre for Research and Policy Studies , a think - tank based in Kabul , told AJ that “ this incident will contradict all their [ the U.S. military ’s ] efforts ” to “ win people ’s hearts and minds ” , adding that it “ will be a difficult task for the U.S. military to show to the Afghan people that they are trying to protect civilians ” .
A study [ . pdf ] released today by the Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict ( CIVIC ) found : “ In 2009 , more Afghan civilians died as a result of conflict than in any other year since the U.S. invasion , with many more suffering injury and property loss … .
Under international law and agreements signed with the Afghan government , ISAF troop contributing nations are not liable for damage to civilian property or civilian injury or death as a result of their operations .
Yet most ISAF members offer ‘ ex - gratia ’ ( out of kindness ) payments to civilians . ” ( h/t : Nathan Hodge )
Vice Admiral William McRaven , Gen. McChrystal ’s successor as commander of Joint Special Operations Command , brought Mohammad Tahir two sheep , “ the equivalent of begging for forgiveness ” , ABC News reports .
( h/t : Glenn Greenwald ) Mr. Tahir lost his 18 - year - old daughter and two sisters - in - law in a February massacre by ISAF troops for which NATO has claimed responsibility for the deaths of the Afghan government officials with two pregnant women and the teenage girl murdered in the night raid .
To cover up the slaughter of the women , “ [ S.O.F . ] soldiers dug bullets out of their victims ’ bodies in the bloody aftermath of a botched night raid , then washed the wounds with alcohol ” to stage the scene as a ‘ honor killing ’ that preceded the raid , Jerome Starkey reported at the London Times .
Mr. Tahir accepted the sheep , but said it was n’t necessary , adding that he only asks the officer who supplied the faulty intelligence that led to the night raid be brought to justice .
“ You do n’t have to give him to us , ” the family told Vice Adm .
McRaven , Mr. Tahir said .
“ At least hand him over to the Afghan government . ”
Dr. Porter reports that Gen. McChrystal and ISAF intelligence chief General Michael Flynn , “ have admitted the profound ignorance of the U.S. military about Afghan society , while avoiding the implications of that ignorance for the issue of false intelligence on the Taliban ” .
He later adds [ emphasis added ] :
More often than not , the U.S. and NATO have depended heavily on ties with Afghan tribal leaders and warlords .
That has proven disastrous over and over again .…
Despite such warnings , however , C.I.A. and military intelligence operatives have continued to rely on tribal patriarchs and local warlords as intelligence sources on the Taliban .
As recently as December 2008 , U.S. intelligence officials were telling Washington Post reporter Joby Warrick that their operatives had been using gifts of Viagra , among other inducements , to get warlords and tribal leaders to provide such intelligence .
The U.S. military , including S.O.F. units , have also relied on local warlords to provide security for their bases and logistics , as documented by a study by the Centre on International Cooperation at New York University last September .
Those ties translate into channels for intelligence as well .
The most egregious example is the C.I.A. ’s use of intelligence from Ahmed Wali Karzai , the brother of President Hamid Karzai , the chairman of the Kandahar province council and the most powerful figure in the province .
In the most widely known instance of mass civilian casualties from a U.S. attack , an airstrike on the village of Azizabad in Heart province in August 2008 , Afghan officials expressed certainty that U.S. commanders had been misled by a rival of clan leader Timor Shah , who had died some months before … .
The U.S. command carried out a devastating bombing of what turned out to have been a memorial ceremony for Timor Shah .
As many as 90 civilians , including 60 children , were killed by the bombing .
U.N. Rapporteur Philip Alston wrote in a May 2009 report that “ numerous government officials ” had told him that “ false tips ” had “ often ” caused night raids to result in the killing of innocent civilians .
He reported that one provincial governor had “ stated that there were people in his province who made a business acting as intermediaries who would give false tips to the international forces in return for payment from individuals holding grudges . ”
Alston was told by a village elder in Nuristan that a district government had fed false information to “ international forces ” that led to a raid targeting his local opponents .
He also said a similar incident in Nangarhar ’s Ghani Khel district was reported to him .
Alston reported that a “ senior official ” who responded to his critical report did not deny that “ feuds ” drive much of the identification of local Taliban officials .
Instead the official suggested that such “ feuds ” were simply “ part and parcel of the conflict between the Taliban and the Government ” .
Instead of admitting that U.S. intelligence was fatally flawed , the U.S. military command had simply adopted a justification that did not require any real understanding of the society .
McChrystal , on the other hand , has lamented that ignorance but continues to authorise raids that are based on the faulty intelligence it generates .
S.O.F. are “ stationed at forward operating bases throughout the country while others conduct raids and missions in areas where they have no permanent presence ” , therefore , “ often do not compensate and rely on local U.S. forces or the Government of Afghanistan to investigate and provide payment ” , according to CIVIC .
“ In some cases , local commanders or Judge Advocates will investigate S.O.F. incidents .
However , S.O.F. often fail to share information and coordinate with local forces , delaying and hampering investigations ” .
“ The secrecy surrounding U.S. S.O.F . also leaves victims without answers or acknowledgement of their losses , ” the study continues .
“ As U.S. S.O.F .
do not often engage in this process or disclose their involvement in operations , Afghans harmed by their operations are more likely to be overlooked ” .
The latest attack by ISAF in Kandahar is being investigated and if the probe displays fault , families of the dead could receive up to the equivalent of $ 2,000 , the injured up to $ 400 .
The Afghans do n’t primarily ask for money .
Historically , survivors of gross aggression demand justice .
Mr. Tamir ’s family wants the intelligence officer brought to some sort of justice , he said after receiving the sheep .
More significant to the article , brought to my attention by Mr. Greenwald , is that Mr. Tamir told ABC that “ he saw American troops extract bullets from the women ’s bodies , an explosive charge in a conservative country where American troops are generally told to avoid interacting with women , especially in southern and eastern Afghanistan ” .
This initially infuriated him to consider going so far as to become a suicide bomber .
“ I have lost patience .
I am obliged to revenge my martyrs , ” he told an ABC News cameraman on March 18 .
“ I will destroy everything I have and will launch my own suicide attack .
My heart is burning . ”
To which Mr. Greenwald adds [ emphasis added ] :
[ A] nd had this man carried through on that threat , American media — as always — would undoubtedly have depicted it as some sort of senseless , irrational act of religious fanaticism underscoring yet again how primitive , violent , and full of baseless rage those radical Muslim Terrorists are and how vital it therefore is that we stay and defeat these Evil Enemies .
This is what has been happening over and over for a full decade now .
How many new America - haters and suicide bombers did we create today with the story ( accurate or not ) of our bombarding that civilian bus with bullets ?
How many have been created by what Gen. McChrystal calls the “ amazing number ” of innocent people and families we ’ve shot at Afghan checkpoints in the last nine months alone ?
Listen to the embittered anti-American rage of the brother of the 21 - year - old Reuters photographer killed by the Apache helicopter in Baghdad after the brother ( along with hundreds of millions of other Muslims ) viewed the WikiLeaks video .
Two weeks ago , horror over a deadly suicide attack in the Moscow subway system was quickly followed by the unsurprising revelation that the suicide bomber was the young widow of an insurgent killed by Russian forces three months ago , because suicide bombers tend to be what gets produced when foreign armies kill people ’s loved ones .
WikiLeaks is now preparing to release graphic video of an American airstrike last year that killed close to 100 Afghan civilians , after which the U.S. vehemently ( and falsely ) insisted that it was Taliban fighters , not civilians , who were killed .
How many suicide bombers did that incident create , and how many will be created when the video of what we did is broadcast around the world ?…
Both Gen. Petraeus and Gen. McChrystal have been admirably candid about the link between our actions and the Terrorist reaction they cause , along with the need to be mindful of that causal link , but waging war in countries where the Enemy is composed of a substantial part of the population will inevitably entail incidents like the bus shooting this morning , and thus inevitably worsen the Terrorist problem we are ostensibly trying to combat . ”
Germans , ISAF Facing International Blowback in Afghanistan
Three German soldiers were killed in an “ ambush ” in Kunduz on Good Friday .
The firefight resulted in the “ accidental killing ” of six Afghan soldiers , Der Spiegel reported days later .
“ Members of the feared Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan are providing arms and training to their fellow fighters in Afghanistan , but Germany is struggling to find an adequate response ” , providing “ good reasons to fundamentally question the German mission in Afghanistan ” , Suzanne Koelbl reports today at Spiegel , adding later [ emphasis added ] :
The fighters of Chahar Dara are backed and trained by non-Afghan religious warriors from former Soviet republics who provide them with top - notch military training and state - of - the - art weaponry .
The foreigners are primarily extremists from the neighboring country of Uzbekistan , but some also come from Tajikistan and Chechnya — and they are highly trained professional killers .
These men belong to the network of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan … .
The cause of the death of the German soldiers tragically resembles the circumstances under which up to 142 Afghans died on a bend in a river only a few kilometers south of Isa Khel on Sept.
4 , 2009 in a controversial air strike that had been requested by German Colonel Georg Klein … .
Apparently , the Taliban hastily organized their April 2 ambush and only deployed their men after they were informed by local spies of the Germans ’ presence .
“ We arrived in Isa Khel just as the soldiers were preparing their return trip , ” Taliban representative Qari Zabihullah from Chahar Dara told SPIEGEL .
Pres. Karzai and Gen. McChrystal visited with tribal leaders in Kunduz on Sunday .
“ Karzai gave a speech renewing his offer to reintegrate Taliban fighters and even commanders into Afghan society if they lay down their weapons ” while Gen. McChrystal “ has identified Kunduz as a second crisis zone — following the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar — and wants to fight far more aggressively in the region ” , Matthias Gebauer and Shoib Najafizada report at Spiegel today .
“ German troops have observed U.S. special units accessing areas located very close to their base almost every night in recent weeks .
German forces were generally kept informed about recent deployments of these tough , elite troops , but the Germans do n’t learn who the troops arrest or kill , or what the U.S. ’s overall strategy in Kunduz may be .
‘ The U.S. is taking the reins out of our hands , ’ one high - ranking officer says . ” — their report continues , adding later that Gen. McChrystal “ plans to solicit more German support for the operation ” .
US Army Lt. Col. Edward Sholtis today accused Iran of providing both “ materiel ” and training for “ Taliban elements ” in Afghanistan .
Another , unnamed US official also claimed that Iran was conducting small - scale weapons training for Taliban fighters .
The allegations appear to be based at least partially on claims by two unnamed Taliban “ commanders ” who say that the Iranian government was paying for them to attend a three month training course in IED attacks in the Iranian city of Zahedan .
Such allegations from US officials crop up from time to time , but are never given much credence , given the history of animosity between the Taliban and the Iranian government .
Officials never seem to present a plausible reason for Iran ’s Shi’ite government , which only barely tolerates its Sunni minority , to back a Sunni militant group which openly calls for the death of all Shi’ites as heretics .
It is entirely plausible that Taliban forces might be in Zahedan , a Sunni dominated city along the border which is teaming with militant factions who regularly attack the Iranian government and the city ’s Shi’ite minority .
Claims that the two are working together , however , seem to center primarily around American assumptions that every faction not on good terms with the United States must secretly be in cahoots .
THE FACTS
Sniffling , sneezing and struggling through allergy season this year ?
You may want to lay off alcohol for a while .
Studies have found that alcohol can cause or worsen the common symptoms of asthma and hay fever , like sneezing , itching , headaches and coughing .
But the problem is not always the alcohol itself .
Beer , wine and liquor contain histamine , produced by yeast and bacteria during the fermentation process .
Histamine , of course , is the chemical that sets off allergy symptoms .
Wine and beer also contain sulfites , another group of compounds known to provoke asthma and other allergy - like symptoms .

In one study in Sweden in 2005 , scientists looked at thousands of people and found that compared with the general population , those with diagnoses of asthma , bronchitis and hay fever were far more likely to experience sneezing , a runny nose and “ lower - airway symptoms ” after having a drink .
Red wine and white wine were the most frequent triggers , and women , for unknown reasons , were about twice as likely to be affected as men .

Whether it is the Earth ’s climate system experiencing warming , or a pot of water being placed on a warm stovetop , the fundamental basis of why the temperature of something changes is the same :
If energy is being absorbed faster than it is being lost , then warming will result .
This is illustrated in the following two plots , which show that imposing such an “ energy imbalance ” on a pot of water ( or on the Earth ’s climate system ) causes warming which is at first rapid , but then slows as the system reaches a new state of energy equilibrium where the rate of energy loss by the system increases to match the rate of energy gain .
Once these two flows of energy once again become equal , the temperature stops changing .
In the context of global warming , more CO2 added to the atmosphere from humanity ’s burning of fossil fuels slightly reduces the Earth ’s ability to cool to outer space through infrared energy loss , contributing to the Earth ’s so - called ‘ greenhouse effect ’ .
This “ heat radiation ” , by the way , is also one of the energy loss mechanisms for a pot of water on the stove .
In global warming theory , this increase in the greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere causes an energy imbalance , which then causes warming .
The warming then increases the rate of infrared energy loss until energy equilibrium is once again restored — but now at a higher temperature .
This is the basic mechanism behind the theory of manmade global warming .
THE TEMPERATURE “ SENSITIVITY ” OF THE SYSTEM
Returning to the above plot , if we know ( 1 ) the amount of energy imbalance imposed upon the system — whether a pot of water or the Earth — and we know ( 2 ) how much the system then warms as a result , we then know the temperature “ sensitivity ” of the system to an energy imbalance .
For instance , if a small energy imbalance leads to a large temperature change , that is called high sensitivity .
This is how all climate models now behave , and is the basis for Jim Hansen ’s and Al Gore ’s fear of a global warming Armageddon .
But alternatively , if a large energy imbalance causes only a small temperature change , then that is called low sensitivity , which is how I , MIT ’s Dick Lindzen , and a minority of other climate researchers believe the climate system behaves .
THE ILLUSION OF A SENSITIVE CLIMATE SYSTEM
I believe that climate researchers have fooled themselves into believing that the climate system is very sensitive .
The reason why is related to a real - world complication to the above simplified example : when we compare a warm year to a cool year in the real climate system , we are NOT looking at the equilibrium response at one of those temperatures , to an energy imbalance imposed at the other temperature .
That would be a very special case indeed , and it is one that never happens in the real world .
To see what usually happens in the real climate system , let ’s return to the example of a pot of water on the stove .
Imagine we keep turning the stove up and down , over and over .
This will result in the water warming and cooling as the temperature responds to the ever - changing energy imbalance of the system .
Now imagine we have measured both the energy imbalances and the temperatures over time so that we can compare them .
If we compare all of the times when the water was warmer to all of the times that the water was cooler , what we will find is that the difference in energy balance between the warmer and cooler temperature states is very nearly the same .
And if a big temperature difference corresponds to only a small change in energy imbalance , this then ‘ looks like ’ a highly sensitive system …even if the system has very low sensitivity !
If we just turn the stove up once , and then let the system come to a new state of equilibrium , then we really can measure the sensitivity of the system .
But if we keep turning the stove up and down , this is no longer possible .
In the real world , the climate system is almost never in a state of energy equilibrium .
Chaotic changes in the average cloud cover of the Earth are like the stove being turned up and down , since the amount of sunlight being absorbed by the climate system is “ turned up and down ” by the ever - changing cloud cover .
As a result , satellite measurements of the Earth energy imbalance will show that there is , on average , only a small energy imbalance difference between warm years and cool years .
This gives the illusion of a sensitive climate system , even if the system is very IN - sensitive .
Again , the illusion arises because we try to measure the sensitivity of the climate system based upon a false assumption : that different temperature states of the Earth correspond to a change from energy dis-equilibrium at one temperature , to energy equilibrium at the other temperature .
This is almost never the case … yet it IS the only case in which the sensitivity of the system can be measured !
Researchers up to this point have been trying to diagnose climate sensitivity from observations of natural climate variations based upon a false assumption .
This issue will be addressed at length , along with theoretical model demonstrations , in our new research paper which has just been accepted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research .

Middle Class Taxes at Historic Lows
Created : April 15 , 2010 10:13 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
It ’s tax day , meaning there will be no end to the rhetorical grandstanding from conservative lawmakers about how the Democrats ’ “ tax - and - spend ” policies are stifling the economy and preventing average folks from achieving the American Dream .
Conveniently , they will ignore these new numbers from the Tax Policy Center , a joint project of the nonpartisan Urban Institute and Brookings Institution , which found that , however you slice them , federal taxes on the median middle - class family are just about at five - decade lows .
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a liberal policy group , explains :
This year , the Making Work Pay tax credit , which President Obama and Congress enacted as part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , is providing a credit of $ 800 to married joint filers ( $ 400 to single filers ) .
A median - income family with two children thus will receive an $ 800 tax cut in the return it files this year .
With the new tax cut , the median family ’s federal income taxes will equal just 4.6 percent of its income in 2009 .
That is lower than in any year since 1955 ( the first year for which these data are available ) except for 2008 , when another stimulus - related tax cut was in effect .
You think those numbers would be cheered by the Tea Party crowd .
They have n’t been .
Instead , you ’ve got Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind . ) taking to the chamber floor and condemning Democrats for “ a budget with record taxes and spending that will add a trillion dollars to the national debt in the next ten years . ”
They passed a national energy tax called cap and trade that will cause utility rates to go up on small businesses and family farms and businesses across this country by hundreds of billions of dollars .
And we just passed ObamaCare with $ 600 billion of tax increases .
And it is n’t even noon yet .
One of the most exciting things for any handyman is buying new tools .
But budget plays a big role in planning your perfect tool set .
As much as we ’d always like to go and buy the best quality tools , sometimes we ca n’t afford the best quality .
Moreover , you do n’t always need a professional level tools , especially if you are buying something that is going to be used infrequently .
However , even if you are looking into the first - class professional tools , there are some ways you can save money .
Many big brands , like Makita , DeWalt or Bosch , often have very good promotions , combo kits and discounts you can use to get great products at excellent prices .
How to save money on power tools ?
There are some question to answer to make sure you get the best possible deal .
Battery or Cord
Are you looking specifically for a battery - operated tool , or you can use a tool that ’s plug - into - the - wall ?
This depends on what kind of work you would be doing .
A cordless drill is convenient when there is n’t a power outlet nearby .
Hauling a generator around is n’t quite as simple or convenient as just grabbing a battery - powered tool , and the cords can also be a tripping hazard .
On the other hand , with corded tool you will never run out power , that are generally more powerful that battery ones , and they are mostly cheaper .
How often are you going to use it ?
Every handyman or a crafts person has his own set of favorite tools that they use more frequently than the others .
For example , if you are a woodworker , you will be using drills and sanders quite a lot , you will be using a router and a circular saw a fair amount , but you are probably not going to use a multi-tool or a reciprocating saw that much .
The tools that you are going to be using a lot are the thing that you need to spend a little bit more money to get better quality .
Everything else is where you do n’t have to splurge .
Buy Combo Kits
Combos can be an especially good deal in the era of cordless tools .
This way you can use the same battery and charger for several tools , and you the price is generally up to 30 % lower than buying each item individually .
The downside is that the combos may include tools that you do n’t want , and some items , like a cheap headlamp , are often thrown in just to increase the number of the items in the combo .
Check Online for Deals
Many retailers offer unique promotions on their websites that you cannot find in the store .
Before hitting the shops , always take a look online to see the dealt you can get if you order online .
In the past people used to avoid online purchases as much as they could , because they could not inspect the product , and the process of returning it for a replacement was n’t easy .
The truth is there is nothing to worry about if you order tools from and authorized online retailer , and you can always check on the brand ’s website who the authorized dealers for their products are .
Before purchasing any tools , especially inexpensive ones , there are two things that you should know .
The first thing is warranty , and the second is the return policy .
The reason for this is that with many cheap tools there is something called an “ out of box failure . ”
That is why you have to make sure that you wo n’t lose money if it turns out that the power tool you ’ve bought just does n’t work .
Update : Since this story ran , Apple has reversed its original decision .
Mark Fiore ’s iPhone app is now for sale .
Full post is up here .
This week cartoonist Mark Fiore made Internet and journalism history as the first online - only journalist to win a Pulitzer Prize .
Fiore took home the editorial cartooning prize for animations he created for SFGate , the website for the San Francisco Chronicle .
I spoke with Fiore about his big win and plans for his business .
Fiore is not on staff at the Chronicle , or anywhere else ; since 1999 , he ’s run a syndication business , selling his Flash animations à la carte to TV , newspaper , and magazine websites for about $ 300 a piece .
( The price varies by size of the outlet . )
In a typical month , he might have about eight clients .
Before 1999 , he ran a similar syndication business for his print cartoons , using a lower - price - per-image , higher - volume model .
When I asked about the next phase of his business , curious if it will include a mobile element , Fiore said he ’s definitely hopeful about mobile devices .
“ I think the iPads and anything iPod to iPhone — to maybe a product not made by Apple — will be good or could be good for distributing this kind of thing , ” he said .
But there ’s just one problem .
In December , Apple rejected his iPhone app , NewsToons , because , as Apple put it , his satire “ ridicules public figures , ” a violation of the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement , which bars any apps whose content in “ Apple ’s reasonable judgement may be found objectionable , for example , materials that may be considered obscene , pornographic , or defamatory . ”
Here ’s the email Fiore received from Apple on December 21 , 2009 :
Dear Mr. Fiore ,
Thank you for submitting NewsToons to the App Store .
We ’ve reviewed NewsToons and determined that we cannot post this version of your iPhone application to the App Store because it contains content that ridicules public figures and is in violation of Section 3.3.14 from the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement which states : “ Applications may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind ( text , graphics , images , photographs , sounds , etc. ) that in Apple ’s reasonable judgement may be found objectionable , for example , materials that may be considered obscene , pornographic , or defamatory . ”
Examples of such content have been attached for your reference .
If you believe that you can make the necessary changes so that NewsToons does not violate the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement , we encourage you to do so and resubmit it for review .
Regards , iPhone Developer Program
Apple attached screenshots of the offending material , including an image depicting the White House gate crashers interrupting an Obama speech .
Two other grabs include images referencing torture , Balloon Boy , and various political issues .
Fiore is n’t the first editorial cartoonist to clash with Apple .
Last year , an app called Bobble Rep app , which used political caricatures by Tom Richmond , was initially rejected by Apple .
After an online uproar , a few days later Apple changed its position , allowing the app into the store .
( Fiore ’s rejection landed in his inbox just a month later . )
Daryl Cagle , who runs a cartoon syndication site with 900 newspaper subscribers , had a similar battle with Apple last year , waiting around for months before eventually being allowed in .
And while Apple eventually ruled in those cartoonists ’ favor , the company went on an app - banning spree in February targeting apps with bikini - level sexual content .
( Although a few established news brands like Sports Illustrated were allowed to remain . )
It ’s also an example of the alarm bells some critics of the app store system were sounding in the lead - up to the release of the iPad.
Brian Chen at Wired warned publishers to consider questions of independence , in light of a controversy over Apple ’s vague policy on sexual content .
And several German news orgs like Bild and Stern have already seen Apple get into the business of banning certain editorial content from the App Store .
Fiore has not resubmitted his app , saying he ’d heard about the experiences of others cartoonists and was n’t in a position to get into a fight with Apple .
Still , he has a hunch Apple will eventually change its mind on him , as it has with other cartoon apps .
“ They seem so much more innovative and smarter than that , ” he told me .
Apple did not respond to my request for comment on its satire policy , or Fiore ’s case in particular .

New Digg CEO Kevin
Rose is wasting no time in changing the direction of the site .
He ’s killing the DiggBar and welcoming back previously banned domains .
But the big challenge he faces is to restart Digg by making it more social , real , personalized and engaging .
The DiggBar is a controversial tool that framed content with Digg branding when a user clicked through from a link on the Digg site .
Though Digg had publicly defended the bar in the past , Rose was none too kind in a blog post :
Framing content with an iFrame is bad for the Internet .
It causes confusion when bookmarking , breaks w/ iFrame busters , and has no ability to communicate with the lower frame ( if you browse away from a story , the old digg count still persists ) .
It ’s an inconsistent / wonky user experience , and I ’m happy to say we are killing it when we launch the new Digg .
Further , Rose said all previously banned domains would be unbanned , another concession to Digg ’s critics .
The site had previously drawn fire for capriciously targeting sites for various infractions but now Rose said the only filtering will be done automatically and be targeted at malware , virus and terms of service violations .
Both changes will happen at a later , non-specified date when Digg launches its version 4.0 redesign .
But these tweaks are only the start of bringing Digg back to its previous heights of growth and influence .
In the last day I ’ve been thinking about what Rose can really do to change Digg for the better , but it strikes me that Digg ’s big problem is it ’s a last - generation social site .
I ’m not trying to be harsh , but the company is experiencing declining traffic and influence , it missed its chance (s ) to get bought , and just swapped CEOs .
Digg , founded in 2004 , sits somewhat awkwardly between the search era and the social era .
Sure , users have friends and posses and there are popular kids , but the dynamics of the site prevent it from harnessing the kind of active link sharing that Twitter and Facebook have run away with .
I ’ll admit I ’ve never been in the Digg in - crowd , but the closest thing I ’ve seen to a community on the site is a mob or a gathering of Diggnation groupies at a live taping .
A place where you use a silly moniker as your user ID just does n’t feel like true socializing in these days of Facebook , Google , OpenID and ( to some extent ) Twitter .
There ’s a value to anonymity , but true social interactions are the kind of powerful things that keep you coming back .
Endorsing a piece of content with your own name in the context of your known interests for an established group of friends or readers is quite powerful .
Digg has already integrated with Facebook Connect , and Rose could probably do more with social norms to encourage users to be themselves on the site .
Digg actually has a lot in common with YouTube ( s GOOG ) .
Both sites are plagued with crude and unproductive semi-anonymous comments ( though Digg users were rather nice to departing CEO Jay Adelson yesterday ) .
They are user - generated content sites rather than social networks .
That ’s not a bad thing , but it ’s accentuated on Digg because the user groups have dramatically different goals .
Active users control the content .
Readers come to get a sampling .
Publishers hope they can game the system or at least benefit from it .
Neither Digg or YouTube has really been able to cultivate a community of user - generated content consumers .
YouTube , however , has the benefit of hosting videos that people actually watch , while Digg users click off site to go experience linked content .
Digg had previously tried to grab for departing users with the DiggBar , but now it will have to figure out better ways to keep them around .
And in that respect , I do think Digg ’s big long - awaited relaunch is a good idea .
It ’s supposed to make the site more personalized — so each user would see a customized news feed of stories he or she is likely to be interested in .
That could go a long way towards more useful and real interactions and sharing around the site .
And that , in turn , would bring back the quality traffic and network effects that a modern social web experience offers .
I ’m not sure if a social retrofit is even possible , but at least Rose seems motivated to chuck out past efforts and , hopefully , try something new .

BP is now fighting the Environmental Protection Agency ’s demands to change its use of toxic dispersants , after over 700,000 gallons have been used on the hundred - million - gallon Deepwater Horizon oil blowout .
The dispersants have created an invisible toxic cloud of unknown size below the surface , as the federal government lets BP block attempts to monitor the gusher , study the undersea plumes , or learn about the dispersants being used .
On Monday , Good Morning America correspondent Sam Champion and Philippe Cousteau Jr. , the chief ocean correspondent for Planet Green and grandson of Jacques Cousteau , explored the toxic plumes of dispersed oil floating beneath the waves in the Gulf of Mexico :
This , critics say , is what BP does not want you to see : oil and chemical dispersants swirling together into a toxic soup , forming large plumes under the surface of the water as deep as twenty - five feet , perhaps deeper .
The small droplets of dispersed oil are “ capable of passing right into the flesh of fish and birds . ”
“ It ’s absolutely disgusting , ” Cousteau described .
“ I think this has got to be one of the most horrible things I ’ve ever seen underwater . ”

Stuttgart State Academy of Art and Design graduate Beatus Kopp has designed a table with hollow legs through which electrical wires can be channeled .
Called aTable , the product is made of glass - reinforced plastic and has four holes on the table surface , leading wires down through the legs and out the bottom .
Kopp presented his table at Blickfang in Stuttgart last month .
Here 's a bit of text from the designer :
The inspiration for this table was based on the most basic requirements the user has of any ordinary table .
Following this idea the design is reduced to its most basic element ; a plane , flat work surface , where the legs are simply an continuous extension of this surface .
This minimalistic approach is also seen in the functionality and construction of this table .
While the top surface has a smooth finish , the underside is raw and uneven in contrast .
a Table also accommodates contemporary electronic equipment , but is still versatile enough to accommodate individual tastes .
It is minimalist in design and materiality , easy to assemble , but still highly stable .
Material : Fibre - glass reinforced resin
Colour : White
Dimensions : 180 x 90 x 72 cm
Weight : ca. 13 Kg
Set up : Detachable legsaTable
Blogger Monkeyfister has been watching the BP Live Cam all week and commenting on strange disruptions and gas explosions .
His account suggests the situation is worse than BP is letting on , and it 's deteriorating :
I 've been watching the live Spillcam , and discussing it with folks , here all day long .
About 5 pm last night , we all started taking note of gas bubbling out of the seabed floor .
It started earlier than that , actually -- see pic a few posts down .
About 1 am this morning , the eruptions began to increase in spew volume .
At about 8 am , CDT , as I watched , things started changing rapidly .
Where the water around the two major gush points used to be very clear , it is now super turbid , and detritus is flying everywhere in a chaotic manner .
seabed venting is obvious to see when ROV cameras pan around .
Yet - to - be - confirmed rumors are that the casing wall has finally worn through , about 300 feet below seabed , at an annulus ( coupling ) , and the gas and oil are now finding a new way out to the seabed .
Not good news , as it will make the Top - Kill / Junk Shot nearly ineffectual ...
At the least , it means that more pressure and mud / cement is going to be required .
See Monkeyfister 's dramatic account here -->
Can you really tell what 's going on in the grainy live cam image ?
Since the disruptions noted by Monkeyfister , BP has delayed Operation Top Kill and reduced estimates of the siphon collection rate .
On this day , 35 years ago , Guy Lafleur took the first big step in establishing a legendary career .
It was March 29 1975 , towards the end of his breakout season , that Lafleur became the third Montreal Canadiens player ( and eleventh NHL player ) to score 50 goals in a season .
Among Habs , Maurice Rocket Richard had set the standard thirty years before in 1945 with his famous 50 in 50 and Boom Boom Geoffrion equalled that total in 1961 .
Lafleur ’s goal came in the first period of a Saturday night game at the Forum in which the Habs defeated the expansion Kansas City Scouts 4 - 1 .
Taking a pass from his centreman Pete Mahovlich , Lafleur fired a wrist shot past goaltender Denis Herron while teammate Steve Shutt was tied up with a defenseman in front .
As the puck went into the net , the fans erupted and gave Lafleur a standing ovation and threw debris on the ice which delayed the game for a few minutes .
Television cameras showed a smiling Lafleur exchanging a handshake with Peter Mahovlich near the Canadiens bench while a big starry number 50 flashed on the television screen , similar to the big 500 had been shown when Jean Béliveau attained that career milestone , four years earlier .
Watching the game on television , the Rocket called the Forum between periods to congratulate Lafl eur and wish him well in breaking the record .
When asked by reporters after the game how he felt after scoring the goal , Lafleur expressed relief : " That 's it .
I said to myself .
I got it .
It 's in , " he told the media .
In the papers , many people such as The Rocket , Larry Robinson and even goaltender Denis Herron said that Lafleur really deserved all the accolades for his feat because he had worked so hard in achieving it .
By this point and peak in his young career , the 23 - year - old right winger finally became the spectacular superstar everybody was expecting he would become since he was drafted first overall in 1971 .
The 50 - goal mark was an exclamation mark to a great season .
Lafleur had already made team history three weeks before in a March 7 game at the Forum against the Washington Capitals by becoming the first Canadiens player to record 100 points in a season .
That game had been Lafleur ’s first game back after missing ten games due to a broken finger and he registered four points ( 2 goals , 2 assists ) to reach the 100 point plateau ( his linemate Mahovlich reached the mark two games later ) .
Again , Lafleur received a thundrous ovation from the Forum crowd .
A bit earlier that season , on January 26 , Lafleur registered a 4 goal night in the Forum against the Pittsburgh Penguins and his former teammate , Michel Plasse .
Here is a short video montage of Lafleur ’s 49th goal which he scored on a tremendous rush , one game earlier on March 26 in Pittsburgh against goalie Gary Inness ( a 6 - 4 Penguins win ) ,
It is followed by the clip of the 50th goal against Kansas City .
Unfortunately , I did n’t find the original play by play call of these goals .
Lafleur 's record - breaking 51st goal came the very next evening in Boston against goalie Gilles Gilbert ( see picture below ) .
It was a third period game tying goal ( the game ended 2 - 2 ) .
" Yvon Lambert made a terrific play on it , " Lafleur told The Gazette .
" He gave me the puck and I had a wide open net .
I just made it fast . "
Lafleur would score two more by the end of the season to raise his team records to 53 goals and 119 points in 70 games .
Mahovlich finished with 117 points in 80 games and established team records for assists ( 82 ) and points by a centerman , both of which he still holds today .
Lafleur and Mahovlich placed fourth and fifth in league scoring respectively .
Lafleur would go on the become the greatest and most exciting player of the latter half of the seventies , racking up six straight 50 goal and 100 points campaigns , an NHL record at the time , that included improvements to his team goals and points records .
It was almost one year to the day , on March 27 , 1976 , when Lafleur again scored his fiftieth at the Forum against the Scouts and Denis Herron ( Herron would be victim of a third Lafleur 50th in 1979 ) .
That season , Lafleur raised his Canadiens goals and points record to 56 and 125 respectively and won the first of his three consecutive scoring championships , and of course , the first of four consecutive Stanley Cups .
Lafleur was the first Hab to win the scoring championship since Geoffrion in 1961 .
The following year , he set a new points record with 136 while Steve Shutt registered a new high of 60 goals , a feat Lafleur would match in 77 - 78 .
Lafleur won the Hart Trophy as the NHL 's most valuable player both years .
Here is a short video montage of Lafleur fiftieth goals in 1977 ( vs Buffalo ) and 1978 ( vs Washington ) along with his sixtieth goal ( vs Detroit ) that same year .
Again , I could not find the original play by play of these highlights .
During the 74-75 campaign , Guy Lafleur became the idol of a new generation of Canadiens fans ( myself included as I was nine years old at the time ) .
It was estimated at the time , that in one particular hockey season , Lafleur had become the subject of 600 articles .
Superstardom had definitely arrived .
Lafleur started to make various TV appearances and he was featured on the cover of various publications including the 75 - 76 Canadiens yearbook with Rocket Richard and Boom Boon Geoffrion and many others , such as the December 1975 cover of the french Hockey Mag shown below .
In 1976 , the first of several books on Lafleur was published , written by journalist Yvon Pedneault ( shown below also ) .
This galvanization towards a new hero even shows up in a movie of the time .
I leave you with a little clip from the 1975 movie
The mystery of the Million Dollar Hockey Puck which features Canadiens and Lafleur highlights from 74 - 75 .
The clip pretty much sums up the excitement of Lafleur , pulling fans from their seats , as he had began the habit of doing that season .
For a look back into the pages of the Montreal Gazette and the time of this Lafleur milestone , click this link .
Red Dead Redemption Hands On : So I Want To Be A Cowboy
My eyes squinting as the sun rises over the harsh desert landscape , it ’s time to pack up the campsite and mount up .
I kick dust over the smouldering fire , holster my six shooter and get ready to take on the Wild West .
I ’m playing some early code of Red Dead Redemption , and I ’m wishing I were a real cowboy …
It ’s all the same , only the names will change
Set in the early 1900s as America goes through a time of huge social upheaval , Rockstar ’s upcoming open world game Red Dead Redemption is spectacularly gripping .
It was a time when the good guys were bad guys and the bad guys could be good guys , when government was beginning to take greater control in regulating the frontier and the world was changing as industry began to revolutionise daily life .
As you gaze out , mounted on your horse and observe the dusty world as it stretches out before you , you realise this is not just Grand Theft Auto set in the Wild West .
After all , there are no real cities – just shanty towns , remote houses and miles of wilderness in between .
The sun rises and sets as you make your way through a world of fictional characters and fictional towns , as the weather dynamically changes from a beautiful sunset to vicious storms that leave you desperately wanting to find shelter .
The level of detail – even in the early code of the game the guys at Rockstar let me have a play with – gave the impression that the game world and early 1900s frontier America would n’t be too different .
Everyday , it seems we ’re wasting away
There ’s only so much time you can ride your horse along dusty trails , watching the spectacular vista of rock formations and tumbleweeds drifting past a field of cactus .
Being an open world game where most of the landscape is , well , open , could be a sure - fire recipe to boredom .
Fortunately , Red Dead Redemption is full of really clever ways to keep you interested .
The biggest , and probably most important , are the NPC interactions .
As you ride along the path , you ’ll encounter random situations , like a criminal about to be shot , or a woman being chased by a herd of wolves , or simply some cowboys galloping past .
And you can choose to interact with them or not in any way you see fit .
You can save the criminal by killing the lawmen , or you can save the cops a bullet by doing their work for them .
Each action ( or sometimes inaction ) plays a part in your characters progression .
Another place where the faces are so cold
The way your character is viewed by non-playing characters is managed through a combination of honour and fame , with your actions throughout the game influencing both metrics .
Take down a wanted criminal by using your lasso and capturing him alive and your honour and fame meters will both grow in the positive .
Kill a coach full of innocent civilians , and your honour will decrease , but your fame might rise .
As your character grows , NPCs will interact with you differently , perhaps offering discounts in stores , or challenging you to a dual .
I ’d drive all night just to get back home
Imagine every Western ever made , and what do you see ?
Dusty towns , wide open spaces , gunslingers drinking and gambling at a local bar .
Ladies travelling around in stage coaches .
Steam trains .
Red Dead has got them all , and they all look spectacular .
And you can enjoy them all .
One action sequence shown by Rockstar has you driving a stage coach full of TNT into a fort controlled by the Mexican army .
Another has you drinking in a bar .
You can generally bust your way into buildings , making it a truly “ open ” open - world game .
I ’m a cowboy
You play as John Marston , an outlaw trying to make a proper life for himself after a heist gone wrong .
You have a wife and child , and have left the criminal life behind you …
At least until a couple of real nasty guys working for the government take your family hostage until such times you hunt down the other members of your old gang .
The story is still a pretty close kept secret in terms of details , but one thing that stands out is the voice acting – even in the early versions I saw and played , John Marston has the perfect cowboy voice .
It also sounds insanely familiar , but I can’t place it and Rockstar wo n’t tell me …
On a steel horse I ride
It would n’t be a western if it did n’t involve horses , and lots of them .
At any time , you can whistle for your horse and have it come running to your side , ready for you to jump on and ride away .
Although horses are just another animal in the RDR universe , which means they can be killed from underneath you .
Just like GTA , you can hijack a man ’s horse – and sometimes they ’ll even be hijacked from under you .
Sometimes , you ’ll need a new steed , and all that will be available is a donkey .
But you can also upgrade your horse by capturing and breaking a wild horse , herds of which roam the wild .
Sure , they ’ll try and kick you off , but successfully breaking in a superior horse means better stamina and speed , which can mean life and death in some situations .
I ’m Wanted : Dead or Alive
Break the law , and the law will break you .
Or try to , in any case .
If you ’re caught committing a felony , you ’ll get a wanted level .
It wo n’t go away either , and the more crimes you commit , the higher the bounty on your head .
Get it high enough , and gangs of vigilantes will come hunting you , day and night , until you either pay off your debt to society or you gain a full pardon for doing something really good .
If you do develop a wanted level and gangs are hunting you , you can escape them temporarily by running .
You can also aide your criminal intentions by buying and wearing a bandanna during your criminal activities , which decreases the chances of being caught significantly .
Other nice touches include only getting a wanted level for crime if you ’re witnessed – after accidentally shooting an innocent horserider , his partner rode to the nearest town to inform the authorities .
Had I shot his partner down , nobody would have known I was a cold blooded murderer .
Sometimes I sleep , sometimes it ’s not for days
Multiplayer free mode is a sure - fire recipe for long , sleepless nights .
As the in game clock cycles from day to night and back again , you and your friends will be able to roam throughout the entire game world , either shooting each other to smithereens , or forming posses , and travelling the world to hunt , take down gang hideouts or search for rare herbs to access new areas of the map .
Each of your actions in free mode earn you XP , which helps you level up like an RPG , the benefits of which include being able to upgrade your horse and weapons as well as unlocking new challenges .
And the people I meet always go their separate ways
Red Dead Redemption is the game Rockstar made their impressive Rage physics engine for .
While it was impressive in GTA IV , the company has tweaked , fiddled and improved its performance for Red Dead .
And coupled with the Euphoria character engine , the end result is realistic reactions from characters both physically and virtually .
The combination means that the same scene will always be ever so slightly different , no matter how many times you play it .
It also allows for some pretty awesome sharp shooting challenges and reactions – shooting a pistol out of an enemy ’s hand is the Red Dead equivalent to saying “ Pwned ” .
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
While still a far cry from being an RPG , Red Dead does place a lot more importance on the use of items .
Bandanas for improving your criminal activities , upgraded campsites and booze are all purchasable , while you can sell items you come across during your travels , either from your hunting escapades , treasure hunting experiences or stuff you just happen to stumble across .
And times when you ’re alone all you do is think
After a shootout , look up at the sky and watch as the vultures start circling above , shoot one down and it ’ll launch into a sharp shooter mode , which will help your character level up .
I walk these streets , a loaded six string on my back
The weapons in the game are actually modelled on the weapons from the early 1900s , which adds that extra level of authenticity Rockstar does so well .
There ’s a huge variety of firearms , including pistols , rifles , early sniper rifles , sawn - off shotguns ( and regular shotguns ) , plus your trusty lasso and hunting knife .
Not that you ’ll notice the intricacies of early 20th Century ballistics as you ’re blowing the head off an outlaw to collect the bounty …
I play for keeps , ’ cause I might not make it back
One of the key differentiators for Red Dead is the use of Dead Eye , a skill that slows down time and allows you to target enemies a lot more accurately .
As you progress through the game , the skill develops – originally you can just slow down time , but eventually you paint targets on your enemies , allowing you to empty your pistol into a bad guy or headshot three approaching enemies effortlessly .
The best part about Dead Eye is that it works in multiplayer too , giving you that extra second or two to steal a kill from under an opponent ’s nose .
I ’ve been everywhere , and I ’m standing tall
Hunting down wanted criminals is a great way to earn some extra cash and fame .
At police stations in various towns , the local constabulary will place wanted posters on their walls .
If you want to be a bounty hunter , wander over to the wall and grab the poster – you ’ll pop it in your pocket and a waypoint will be placed on your map .
You get a lot more fame and honour if you capture the leader of the gang alive with your lasso , so make sure you do n’t kill him .
Try shooting him in the leg and watch him try and crawl away , before you hogtie him and throw him on the back of your horse .
I ’ve seen a million faces an I ’ve rocked them all
If you ’re after a more competitive multiplayer experience , Red Dead also has a whole series of game modes to keep you entertained .
Typical shootouts , deathmatches , team deathmatches and capture the flag match types are all available , done in true western style .
As each match loads , you ’re given the opportunity to gain a slight advantage over your competitors in a “ last man standing ” shootout .
As all the players stand around in a circle , or in two lineups opposite each other , you must try and survive a bloody shootout where every player is told that they will probably die .
On top of that , there ’s also western - specific matches , like a free for all goldrush match where you have to collect as many bags of gold as you can and drop them off at the nearest collection point while preventing other players from doing the same .
Wanted : Dead or Alive
Despite the fact that I ’ve only had a limited hands on session with small sections of the game , it ’s impossible not to be smitten with the massive scope of Red Dead Redemption .
The game launches on May 21 , and without a doubt is going to be one of the biggest games of the year .
And it ’s definitely sitting comfortably at the top of my Wanted list .
When Kraft took over Cadbury in January , the deal was viewed as a victory of shareholder capitalism .
The acquired company ’s deeply English roots were no match for the wealth shareholders could gain by selling out to what one Cadbury family member called “ a company that makes cheese to go on hamburgers . ”
Cadbury chairman Roger Carr said , “ The reality is we are part of a global business . ”
Did Carr have a choice ?
Was he truly beholden to his shareholders ’ desire to take the deal ?
If not , how can directors act against the wishes of shareholders to preserve value for other stakeholders — value that is often less easily measured than a buyout price ?
In the wake of the scandals that caused the recession , the management world has been immersed in trying to answer such questions .
Oddly , no previous management research has looked at what the legal literature says about the topic , so we conducted a systematic analysis of a century ’s worth of legal theory and precedent .
It turns out that the law provides a surprisingly clear answer : Shareholders do not own the corporation , which is an autonomous legal person .
What ’s more , when directors go against shareholder wishes — even when a loss in value is documented — courts side with directors the vast majority of the time .
Shareholders seem to get this .
They ’ve tried to unseat directors through lawsuits just 24 times in large corporations over the past 20 years ; they ’ve succeeded only eight times .
In short , directors are to a great extent autonomous .
There is no legal basis for the idea of shareholder supremacy .
And yet , in an important 2007 article in the Journal of Business Ethics , 31 of 34 directors surveyed ( each of whom served on an average of six Fortune 200 boards ) said they ’d cut down a mature forest or release a dangerous , unregulated toxin into the environment in order to increase profits .
Whatever they could legally do to maximize shareholder wealth , they believed it was their duty to do .
Why are directors so convinced of their obligation that they ’d make decisions with such damaging results ?
If the law clearly does n’t call for all the kowtowing , could n’t Cadbury ’s Carr have assumed a more defiant stance against a takeover ?
The problem , we believe , is that managers and lawyers have failed to meaningfully collaborate on defining directors ’ role .
That lack of communication has led to the election of directors who , frankly , do n’t know what their legal duties are .
Indeed , they ’re being taught the wrong things .
The case still most often used in law schools to illustrate a director ’s obligation is Dodge v. Ford Motor ( 1919 ) — even though an important 2008 paper by Lynn A .
Stout explains that it ’s bad law , now largely ignored by the courts .
It has been cited in only one decision by Delaware courts in the past 30 years .
Collaboration between legal and management entities should start at the MBA and executive - education level , to change the way directors are trained and developed .
But it should also shape director selection , a process where trustworthiness and independence from all stakeholders , not just from managers , is critical .
The impact on directors ’ decision making could be significant .
The Cadburys of the future may not end up selling out just because it looks like a good deal for the shareholders .
CHARLI takes a few steps while Seungmoon Song , a master ’s student in electrical and computer engineering , observes .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
As CHARLI takes his first steps , anxious onlookers stand ready to catch him if he falls .
His stride is short , but upright , as one foot is placed in front of the other in the basement of Virginia Tech ’s Randolph Hall .
But CHARLI is no toddler .
He is a 5 - foot tall humanoid robot built by graduate and undergraduate students with the Virginia Tech College of Engineering ’s Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory ( RoMeLa ) .
After a long moment , CHARLI comes to a rest .
An audible “ Whew ! ” is heard from CHARLI ’s main architect , doctoral student Jeakweon ( “ J.K. ” ) Han.
Dennis Hong , associate professor of mechanical engineering and director of RoMeLa , ca n’t resist a joke .
“ One small step for a robot , one giant leap for robotics , ” he shouted .
Hong is n’t entirely facetious , though .
CHARLI ( that ’s for Cognitive Humanoid Autonomous Robot with Learning Intelligence ) is historic .
CHARLI is the first untethered , autonomous , full - sized , walking , humanoid robot with four moving limbs and a head , built in the United States .
His two long legs and arms can move and gesture thanks to a combination of pulleys , springs , carbon fiber rods , and actuators .
CHARLI soon will be able to talk as well .
Fans of robotics are taking note .
“ This is a significant milestone in robotics engineering and is a testament to the technological leadership of Virginia Tech ’s RoMeLa lab , ” said Tom Atwood , editor of “ Robot ” magazine .
Of course it will be many years before CHARLI or his incarnations will be seen walking around campus or even in homes across America .
Hong refers to the latter placement as his “ Jetsons Goal ” ( named for the popular 1960s cartoon that featured Rosie , a robotic maid for the futuristic family ) .
“ The environment we live in is designed for humans :
The step size of stairs , the height of door handles , etc. , are designed by humans for humans , ” Hong said .
“ Thus for a robot to live among us and to serve us , it needs human size and form .
Thus humanoids .
But , manipulation with hands , perception , intelligence , and autonomy are all important and difficult research problems that need to be addressed . ”
That research is under way .
There are two CHARLIs .
Derek Lahr , a Ph.D. student at RoMeLa , holds the leg of the humanoid robot , CHARLI H .
This bulky , stronger robot will utilize various technologies that may allow it to walk outside .
The one now walking across floors and motioning his arms is CHARLI L , as in Lightweight .
He ’s meant to walk indoors on known flat surfaces , but not run or jump .
Eventually , he will be able to kick soccer balls .
The robot is expected to debut at this year ’s RoboCup tournament in Singapore .
Then there is CHARLI H ( for Heavy ) .
This bulkier robot will utilize custom - designed actuators and other technologies that one day will allow it walk on the sloping , rising ground that comprises Virginia Tech ’s campus .
He also will be able to run , jump , kick , open doors , pick up objects , and do just about anything a real person can do .
“ CHARLI H will be a fully functioning robot , ” said Derek Lahr , a Ph.D. student from Charleston , S.C. , who is spearheading the “ H ” project .
For now , only one leg of CHARLI H is complete .
The students built CHARLI L with $ 20,000 in seed money from the Virginia Tech Student Engineers ’ Council and donated equipment from National Instruments and Maxon Precision Motors .
“ The budget constraints actually inspired us to think of different solutions , ‘ How can we actually make this happen with a small budget ? '
And that actually led us to new types of mechanical solutions , ” Hong said .
Work on the robot began in 2008 with 13 undergraduate and graduate students working on the project at any given time .
Inspiration came from science - fiction films and spouses .
“ I hope CHARLI could help physically challenged people to cook , clean , and carry items like the NS - 5 , ” said Han , referring to the humanoid robot at the center of the 2004 film “ I , Robot . ”
Han ’s design concept was assisted by his wife , Younseal Eum , who is an artist .
Atwood said he is excited for the future .
“ Eventually , there will be a robot in every home assisting families and individuals , and walking robots will find work in all kinds of places , from warehouses to manufacturing centers , ” he said .
Indeed ,
Hong will have seen his “ Jetsons Goal ” come true .

Chicago Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz said the team will " seriously consider " hosting viewing parties at the United Center when the Blackhawks go on the road to play the Philadelphia Flyers in the Stanley Cup finals .
" I think we would do very well , " Wirtz said Tuesday on " The Afternoon Saloon " on ESPN 1000 .
" I think some of the thing is we did n't know when the games were , but I think we would have a full house .
I think it would be fun .
I think it 's something we should seriously consider . "
The Blackhawks , who open the series with Game 1 on Saturday and Game 2 on Monday at the United Center , will play in Philadelphia on June 2 and 4 .
Julius Genachowski , the chairman of the F.C.C. , had said previously that if the agency lost the Comcast case , he would seek to find other legal authority to implement consumer protections over Internet service .
In a statement , the F.C.C. said it remained “ firmly committed to promoting an open Internet . ”
While the court decision invalidated its current approach to that goal , the agency said , “ the court in no way disagreed with the importance of providing a free and open Internet , nor did it close the door to other methods for achieving this important end . ”
The concept of equal access for all Internet content is one that people who favor some degree of F.C.C. regulation say is necessary not only to protect consumers but also to foster innovation and investment in technology .
“ You ca n’t have innovation if all the big companies get the fast lane , ” said Gigi B. Sohn , president of Public Knowledge , which advocates for consumer rights on digital issues .
“ Look at Google , eBay , Yahoo — none of those companies would have survived if 15 years ago we had a fast lane and a slow lane on the Internet . ”
The court ’s ruling could potentially affect content providers like Google , which owns YouTube , a popular video - sharing service .
Content providers fear that Internet service companies will ask them to pay a fee to ensure delivery of material like high - definition video that takes up a lot of network capacity .
Google declined to comment directly on the ruling but pointed to the Open Internet Coalition , of which it is a member .
The coalition ’s executive director , Markham Erickson , said the decision “ creates a dangerous situation , one where the health and openness of the Internet is being held hostage by the behavior of the major telco and cable providers . ”
Sam Feder , a lawyer who formerly served as general counsel for the F.C.C. , said that the court ’s decision “ is the worst of all worlds for the F.C.C . ”
He said the opinion was written narrowly enough that it was unlikely to be successfully appealed , while also raising enough possibilities of other ways that the F.C.C. could accomplish the same goals that it was unlikely to inspire Congressional action to give the agency specific regulatory authority over the Internet .

Despite the parallels with the current political environment and that of 1994 , Bill Clinton William ( Bill ) Jefferson ClintonNew poll finds Biden narrowly leading Trump in Georgia Changing the climate of presidential debates Davis :
My advice to Joe Biden on eve of the debate — be Joe Biden MORE said the outcome of November ’s election “ is likely to be far less dramatic . ”
“ I do n't think [ the GOP ] will win either house , ” he said on ABC ’s “ This Week ” Sunday .
“ If history is any guide , they should make a few gains .
But I do n't expect them to win in either house , no . ”

The former president expanded on the remarks he made earlier to CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer and theabout how anti-government rhetoric could incite violence as was the case in the 1990s .
Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh seized on the statements and said they were an attempt to discredit the Tea Party movement .
“ The only point I tried to make was that we ought to have a lot of political dissent , a lot of political argument , ” Clinton said .
“ But we also have to take responsibility for the possible consequences of what we say .
And we should n't demonize the government or its public employees or its elected officials .
” Clinton said he was concerned about the threats being made against President , members of Congress and even New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ( R ) .
“ I just think we all have to be careful .
We ought to remember after Oklahoma City .
We learned something about the difference in disagreement and demonization , ” he said .
Clinton ruled himself or his wife , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , out of accepting an appointment to the Supreme Court but he offered some advice to Obama about a prospective nominee .
“ My advice to him would be to , first of all , see what the court 's missing .
Does it matter if he puts a Catholic or a Jewish person or someone of another faith on a court , there might -- there would be no Protestants on the Supreme Court . …
Does there need to be another woman on the court ?
” Clinton encouraged Obama to look beyond the tradition template of experienced judges .
“ You know , I tried to persuade both Senator Mitchell and Governor Cuomo to accept appointments to the court , and for different reasons , neither one wanted to do it , ” he said .
“ I think they would have been fabulous justices .
And -- now , George Mitchell had been a judge , but he was also a senator .
I think that -- I hope he 'll take a look at somebody who has n't been a judge .
” He added , “ I 'd like to see him put someone in their late 40s or early 50s on the court and someone , you know , with a lot of energy for the job .
” Clinton said he thought it would be “ very difficult ” for the GOP to block Obama ’s eventual nominee .
“ I do n't expect him to intentionally pick a fight with the Senate , ” Clinton said before urging Obama not to back down if he finds the “ best person ” for the job .
“ The most important thing is he needs to be really proud of the people he puts on the court , ” he said .
Silicon Valley blogger Ryan Tate was settling into a quiet night at home — a little DVR ’ed 30 Rock , a few sips into his Hennessy and crème de menthe — when Steve Jobs threw a wrench in the works .
“ A commercial for iPad came on , and it contained the word ‘ revolution , ’ ” says Tate , who ’s blogged recently on Valleywag about Apple ’s aggressive response to an iPhone theft involving colleagues at Gawker Media .
“ That word struck a sour chord for me .
Apple ’s been acting in many ways to suppress creativity and expression in the content it allows on the iPhone , including political cartoons .
Jobs is admirable in some ways , but there have been so many cases where Apple seems to be going over to the darker side . ”
So he e-mailed the Apple CEO .
At 1 a.m. , Jobs e-mailed back .
And for 30 minutes , through a heated discussion of Bob Dylan , smartphone porn and even child - raising tips , they butted heads .
In an often defensive and sarcastic tone , Jobs defended Apple , telling Tate in one reply : “ we ’re just doing what we can to try and make ( and preserve ) the user experience we envision .
You can disagree with us , but our motives are pure . ”
Apple , which had banned , then allowed , an app from Pulitzer Prize - winning editorial columnist Mark Fiore , would n’t comment for this report .
But Tate says he received 300 e-mails after posting the exchange , “ and a lot of them were from Mac users who felt the company was getting too controlling .
They buy these products to feel free , but they get upset when Apple acts like Big Brother . ”
This may have just been two valley guys feeling feisty in the wee small hours .
Yet that same conversation is unfolding elsewhere .
On Tuesday , The New Yorker ’s editor , David Remnick , upbraided Apple for essentially censoring its iPad app content .
And from Jon Stewart to Ellen DeGeneres to app developers to The New York Times , a lot of people are wondering : Has Apple , even as its sales and share price go through the roof , grown so big and so controlling that it risks driving developers and the people buying their apps into the arms of competitors like Google ?
“ One of the biggest issues facing Apple today and one that ’s helped change its image is its app - selection process , ” says securities analyst Charles Wolf with Needham & Co .
“ There ’s a great concern in the developers community about the uncertainly surrounding the rules .
If I do n’t know whether my app ’s going to be accepted , why invest time on it ?
Why do n’t I just go to Android ? ”
That review process is tightly controlled by Apple , which for a nonrefundable fee offers developers a software development kit that walks them through the steps and even allows them to test their apps out in an “ iPhone simulator . ”
Developers have complained about rigid standards , a lack of clarity on where their submissions stand ( or why they were rejected ) , and of having to wait for weeks to hear back from Apple , giving competitors a chance to jump ahead of them in line .
There ’s also a concern among some Apple fanboys , if not mainstream consumers , that the company has betrayed that seductive underdog legacy launched on April Fool ’s Day 1976 .
“ The contrast between the company ’s image today and when it first started is pretty dramatic , ” says Roger Kay , the Endpoint Technologies Associates analyst who two years ago in a BusinessWeek column warned that corporate hubris could spell Apple ’s eventual fall from grace .
“ They really did represent the hip outsider .
But Apple ’s no longer the outsider — it ’s been elevated to the pinnacle .
My thesis back then was that they were flying high and they should watch out , and they were n’t even flying as high as they are now .
So my timing may be off , but my thesis still holds . ”
Some critics might see Apple ’s extra-large footprint over online music and smartphone content as a mockery of Jobs ’ 1983 speech when he ranted against “ an IBM - dominated and controlled future . ”
Yet most observers say it really does n’t matter —
Apple ’s doing just great , thank you , and is on track to soon surpass Microsoft as the world ’s most valuable tech company .
Just look at the way PC users keep vaulting the aisle to buy iMacs , iPods , iPhones and iPads .
Branding expert Robert Passikoff attributes Apple ’s initial success “ to the fact that they recognized the emotional connection between a consumer and a product .
Now Apple has become the status quo , ” he says , “ and everyone else is shifting around them .
It ’s not that they ’ve lost their cool — they ’ve become the king of cool , and everyone else is trying to replicate it .
“ They may have lost some of that emotionality from the early days , ” he says , “ but they ’re laughing all the way to the bank . ”
That path , though , is showing a few potholes .
Some developers are upset with what they see as the arbitrary and even moralistic way Apple ’s gatekeepers accept or reject apps for the iPhone and now the iPad .
And Apple ’s move to eighty - six the highly popular Flash technology from the iPad angered critics , including its maker Adobe Systems , which took out full - page newspaper ads across the country to give Apple a piece of its mind .
“ We love creativity , ” it began .
“ We love innovation .
We love apps .
What we do n’t love is anybody taking away your freedom to choose what you create , how you create it , and what you experience on the Web . ”
And then on March 18 , Apple engineer Gray Powell accidentally left a next - generation iPhone at a Redwood City beer hall and all hell broke loose .
The phone was sold to Gizmodo , where editor Jason Chen gave the device what The Daily ’s Show ’s Stewart called “ the whole video tech prostate exam , ” exposing it for all the world to see — and reportedly causing Jobs to see red .
Apple lawyers came unleashed .
Jobs personally appealed to Gizmodo to give the phone back .
Cops raided Chen ’s house .
And in some quarters , Apple antipathy bloomed .
“ I ’m sorry , ” Stewart told his television audience in late April , elevating the iPhone follies into a national gripe session .
“ But this whole thing is out of control , ” he said , before addressing Jobs directly : “ You were the rebels , the underdogs .
People believed in you .
But now you ’re becoming ” — pausing for effect — —… The Man ! ”
Stewart may be guilty of piling on , unable to resist what one analyst called the “ red meat ” of commandos from a law enforcement task force bashing in Chen ’s front door .
On the other hand , the fact that Apple sits on the task force ’s steering committee was not lost on its detractors .
“ How ’s it feel , ” one critic vented on the task force website , “ to be Apple ’s secret police ? ”
L’Affaire Chen was salt in the wounded egos of developers already upset with Apple for what author and app developer Erica Sadun calls its “ controlling and top - down ” corporate culture that can sometimes leave developers in the dark .
“ I do n’t believe there ’s malice on anyone ’s part ; the app reviewers are doing a great job , ” says Sadun , who ’s had apps rejected for what she says were minor technicalities that could have been easily resolved .
“ But Apple does n’t empower its lower - level employees to make common - sense decisions , so everything gets kicked upstairs for approval more than its needs to be . ”
Still , says Sadun , even disgruntled developers who flee Apple often come back “ because they ’re addicted to the audience and the technology Apple provides them .
“ I joke that Apple ’s my abusive boyfriend , ” she says .
“ He looks so good ; I love him ; but he treats me so bad .
It ’s that kind of relationship — you want to leave , but you keep coming back for more . ”

The Goodness of
Grass Fed Beef
Purchasing meat typically involves an initial check of its price , but not everyone is this inquisitive when it comes to its nutritional content and freshness .
Fortunately , the option of grass fed beef is continuously gaining momentum as more people begin to experience the benefits this type of beef offers to human health and the environment .
Continue reading to learn what grass fed beef is , how it stacks up against typical beef and where you can find the best sources of high - quality meats in your area .
Why You Should Consider Grass Fed Beef
Grass fed beef comes from cows that are allowed to graze on pasture and consume their natural diet of grass .
This situation is different from cows raised in concentrated animal feeding operations ( CAFOs ) , which are fed a processed diet containing grains and even growth - promoting drugs .
1
Organic grass fed beef production requires more effort and attention to detail , as ranchers have to follow strict guidelines that will ensure the freshness and quality of the meat .
Because grass fed cows are grown in conditions that are more humane , the meat 's quality is superior to conventional beef .
The meat also tends to be loaded with more nutrients , without the risks attributed to harmful pathogens that are found in conventional beef ( more on this later ) .
Positive long - term effects of grass fed beef production on the environment must be emphasized , too .
A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America sought to discover the benefits of organic versus conventional farming under four key sustainability metrics : productivity , environmental impact , economic viability and social well - being .
2
Researchers analyzed data that emerged in the past 40 years , and the results highlighted these positive effects connected to organic farms :
3
More profitable and can earn farmers anywhere from 22 % to 35 % more compared to their conventional counterparts
More environmentally friendly
Able to produce equally or more nutritious foods with fewer or no pesticide residues
Can provide unique benefits to the ecosystem
Can deliver social benefits by promoting social interactions
Health Benefits of Grass Fed Beef
Regular beef already contains certain nutrients that are beneficial to you .
However , grass fed beef goes above and beyond in terms of nutrition , possessing these important components :
Lower fat levels 4
Higher levels of beta - carotene 5
Higher amounts of minerals like calcium , magnesium and potassium , alongside other minerals like iron , zinc , selenium and phosphorus 6
Higher portions of total omega - 3 fatty acids
Higher amounts of conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA or cis - 9 trans - 11 ) , 7 a potential cancer fighter 8
a potential cancer fighter Higher amounts of vaccenic acid that can be transformed into CLA 9
A healthier ratio of omega - 6 to omega - 3 fatty acids 10
Meat ' Your Match : Grass Fed Beef vs. Grain Fed Beef
The benefits of grass fed beef do not end with its high nutritional content .
If you 're still not convinced why beef from grass fed cows is better , take note of these key points :
Humane growing methods —
Grass fed cows consume their natural diet of grass , since they have been allowed to graze on grasslands during their lifetime .
A grass - rich diet consequently boosts the cow 's health and the quality of meat .
Meanwhile , cows in profit - hungry CAFOs are fattened for slaughter by being fed artificial diets that contained grains , corn , soy , growth - promoting drugs and antibiotics .
Eventually , this diet alters the bacterial balance and composition in the animal 's gut , resulting in meat that 's tainted with potentially health - damaging bacteria .

A grass - rich diet consequently boosts the cow 's health and the quality of meat .
Greater fatty acid composition —
As mentioned earlier , grass fed beef contains higher ratios of healthy fats like vaccenic acid , conjugated linoleic acid and omega - 3 fatty acids , compared to grain fed cows .
As mentioned earlier , grass fed beef contains higher ratios of healthy fats like vaccenic acid , conjugated linoleic acid and omega - 3 fatty acids , compared to grain fed cows .
Lower risk of bacterial infections —
Overcrowding of cows in CAFOs is a very common situation that may lead to increased bacterial contamination .
Samples of CAFO - grown beef revealed traces of antibiotic - resistant bacteria that may have contributed to the increasing number of antibiotic - resistant disease cases being reported .
12
Consumer Reports examined 300 samples of conventionally raised and sustainably produced ( including grass fed ) ground beef to see if there were traces of five types of disease - causing bacteria : Clostridium perfringens , Salmonella , Enterococcus , Staphylococcus aureus and E.coli ( including O157 and six other toxin - producing strains ) .
13
The beef also underwent secondary testing to check if the bacteria in meat were resistant to antibiotics used in human medicine .
The results showed that :14
All of the ground beef samples contained bacteria linked to fecal contamination ( enterococcus and / or nontoxin - producing E. coli ) .
These can lead to blood or urinary tract infections in humans .
Nearly 20 % of the samples contained Clostridium perfringens , which is responsible for nearly a million food poisoning cases in the U.S. annually .
10 % of the samples had a toxin - producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus , which unfortunately , cannot be destroyed even with thorough cooking .
1 % of the samples contained salmonella that causes an estimated 1.2 million illnesses and 450 deaths in the U.S. per year .
Three conventional beef samples showed traces of methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , a bacteria strain linked to nearly 20,000 deaths per year , according to 2017 data .
15 Meanwhile , none of the sustainably raised beef samples contained this bacteria strain .

Where Can I Buy Grass Fed Beef ?
If you 're worried that you wo n't be able to buy grass fed beef in your area , do n't fret .
Due to the increasing demand for grass fed beef , more businesses are aiming to provide healthier options for customers .
You can obtain authentic grass fed beef by contacting a trusted local rancher and buying the meat directly from their farm .
Many ranchers have smaller and cleaner organic and biodynamic farms where cows are n't crowded .
This leads to a lower possibility of the animals harboring pathogens that can contaminate the meat .
You can contact organic ranchers online as an alternative solution if you do n't have access to a local rancher near you .
There are also grocery chains that have responded to consumers ' demand for grass fed beef , so there 's likely to be a small assortment of grass fed beef at your local grocery store or health store .
Some stores like Publix can even stock specialty items at the request of a customer .
When purchasing beef at supermarkets or groceries , look for products that are certified grass fed by the American Grassfed Association ( AGA ) .
Compared to previous standards set by the USDA 's Agricultural Marketing Service ( AMS ) , AGA 's guidelines are more comprehensive and more stringent .
The presence of the AGA logo can essentially guarantee that the meat came from cows that :17
Have been fed a 100 % forage diet
Have never been confined in a feedlot
Have never received antibiotics or hormones
Were born and raised on American family farms , as a vast majority of grass fed meats sold in grocery stores are imported and lack country of origin labeling ( COOL ) , so there 's no guarantee where the meat came from or what standards were followed
AGA 's grass fed label is considered the most trustworthy , since no other grass fed certification delivers the same comprehensive assurance as this label .
Even better , no other grass fed program guarantees compliance using third - party audits like AGA .
You can also check out these organizations in the U.S. that can help you locate grass fed beef and other organically grown produce :
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said Monday that even before the new Arizona immigration law was signed last week , his deputies were arresting " very few " non-Hispanics .
Arpaio is under federal investigation over allegations of mistreatment of prisoners and for allegedly unfairly targeting Hispanics , which he has repeatedly said is politically motivated .
Asked Monday night during an interview on CNN's " Larry King Live " what percentage of non-Hispanics have been detained out of all the arrests his office has made , Arpaio responded : " Well , very few . "
" We happen to be next to the border , " Arpaio said .
" So , consequently , many of the arrests are from Mexico or Latin America . "
While the state does suffer from an illegal immigration as well as violence stemming from the drug trade along the border , Arpaio effectively conceded that Hispanics already represent a disproportionate amount of arrests made in the state .
According to census data , 59.6 percent of the state 's residents are white while 29 percent are Hispanic .
Arpaio disputed that his office is guilty of racial profiling , pointing to the ongoing federal investigation against him that has yet to produce an indictment .
" They 've been roaming around for a year and a half , " he said of the federal investigators .
" If we 're racial profiling , where is the proof ? "

What are such economists thinking ?
Are they advocating that the UK simply refuses to pay its creditors – imposing a " hard default " ?
No , they think they 're being clever by relying on " soft default " , whereby a country lowers its debt obligations through a combination of inflation and currency depreciation .
But , of course , no one is fooled .
What are physicists hoping to see ?
According to some theories , a whole list of items that have n’t been seen yet — with names like gluinos , photinos , squarks and winos — because we have n’t had enough energy to create a big enough collision .
Any one of these particles , if they exist , could constitute the clouds of dark matter , which , astronomers tell us , produce the gravity that holds galaxies and other cosmic structures together .
Another missing link of physics is a particle known as the Higgs boson , after Peter Higgs of the University of Edinburgh , which imbues other particles with mass by creating a cosmic molasses that sticks to them and bulks them up as they travel along , not unlike the way an entourage forms around a rock star when they walk into a club .
Have scientists ever seen dark matter ?
It ’s invisible , but astronomers have deduced from their measurements of galactic motions that the visible elements of the cosmos , like galaxies , are embedded in huge clouds of it .
Will physicists see these gluinos , photinos , squarks and winos ?
There is no guarantee that any will be discovered , which is what makes science fun , as well as nerve - racking .
So how much energy do you need to create these fireballs ?
At the Large Hadron Collider , that energy is now 3.5 trillion electron volts per proton — about as much energy as a flea requires to do a pushup .
That may not sound like much , but for a tiny proton , it is a lot of energy .
It is the equivalent of a 200 - pound man bulking up by 700,000 pounds .
What ’s an electron volt ?
An electron volt is the amount of energy an electron would gain passing from the negative to the positive side of a one - volt battery .
It is the basic unit of energy and of mass preferred by physicists .

For Immediate Release : 7/2/2020
Due to COVID - 19 , the Blue Room Theatre has been closed since March , resulting in a near - complete loss of revenue .
This , combined with the protracted timeline of reopening for larger gatherings , necessitates the following regrettable decisions :
1 ) We must extend the suspension of all in - person productions for the foreseeable future .
2 ) We must release the downtown space that we have called home for 26 years .
These decisions are deeply emotional .
Facing an unknown future for productions is disconcerting , and departing the space where so many have performed , volunteered , worked , and attended shows is painful .
But in the end , it is not the space that defines us and we are confident that we will perform again .
As a company , the Blue Room Theatre remains dedicated to the ideals that brought us together in the first place : enhancing the artistic culture of Chico and Northern California and exploring the strengths and frailties of the human condition .
Our exit from the downtown space will be happening quickly so please follow us on Facebook for updates .
And if you have n’t already , sign up with Patreon to follow our creative direction digitally for the time being .
Your Patreon subscription of even just $ 5 a month will help keep the company alive until we can safely perform in person once again .
COVID - 19 has changed so many things ; this is a continuation of the changes that we must find a way to embrace .
The Blue Room is committed to Chico and the surrounding communities and with your help and support , we will emerge strong and ready for the next phase of our future .
Thank you ,
Blue Room Board of Directors

This article first appeared early this week in

Last week in Beirut , the United Nations Special Tribunal charged with investigating and prosecuting the killers of former Lebanese premier Rafik Hariri brought several members of Hizbullah in for questioning .
The tribunal ’s decision to interview Hizbullah in connection with the 2005 murder appears to confirm a 2009 report in– corroborated more recently by– implicating the Shi’ite militia in the conspiracy .
A shift in the short - term focus of the investigation from Syria to Hizbullah will have a profound impact on domestic politics in Lebanon , and potentially on US - Lebanese relations .
Since the February 2005 assassination of Hariri and the establishment of the UN - mandated inquiry into the killing , the primary public focus of the investigation has been on Damascus .
Indeed , the first report of the International Independent Investigation Commission ( IIIC ) in October 2005 “ conclud[ed ] that ... many leads point directly towards the involvement of Syrian security officials with the assassination .
” Although no mention was made of Hizbullah in the commission ’s quarterly reports through 2009 , the organization – allied historically with Damascus – expressed strong opposition to the formation of the IIIC and bolted from the cabinet in protest of the government ’s decision to support its establishment .
Then , in May 2009 published an article that reported in great detail on how Hizbullah operatives participated in the murder , and how the IIIC had discovered the connection .
The revelations contained in thearticle sent shock waves through Beirut .
The prospect that Shi’ites might have killed the leader of the state ’s Sunni Muslim community has prompted grave concern .
Given the sensitivities , since last May Hizbullah Secretary - General Hassan Nasrallah has repeatedly denied the story , and he insisted on a TV interview on Wednesday that the 12 party members and supporters summoned for questioning were “ witnesses and not suspects . ”
Notwithstanding Nasrallah ’s protests , Hizbullah is struggling increasingly to dissociate itself from the Hariri murder plot .
According to the Lebanese satellite television station al - Jadid , among others , last week ’s UN tribunal interviewees included senior Hizbullah officials Al - Hajj Salim and Mustafa Badreddine .
Salim reportedly heads one of the organization ’s special operations units , which was run by military commander Imad Mugniyah until his assassination in February 2008 ; Badreddine , Mugniyah ’s brother - in - law , heads the militia ’s counterintelligence unit .
The IIIC interviews generated some interesting responses from supporters of Hizbullah ( and Syria ) , most notably former Lebanese cabinet minister Wiam Wahab , who predicted thator civil conflict would ensue if the tribunal proceeded on course .
During a meeting with the Spanish ambassador to Lebanon , Wahab also suggested that the UN Interim Force in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) might be targeted if the tribunal was “ politicized ” – in other words , if it continued to pursue Hizbullah suspects .
For the pro-West March 14 coalition in Lebanon , the allegations of Hizbullah involvement in the murder should come as little surprise .
Not only would the militia have had the capacity to carry out the operation , its close allies in Damascus had the motive .
Members of the coalition had also been at odds with Hizbullah for years , and particularly so since the Hariri assassination and the subsequent Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon .
At the same time , a Hizballah connection to the crime would not in any sense absolve Syria – which then occupied and controlled Lebanon – of culpability .
Yet the IIIC ’s targeting of Hizbullah comes at an awkward time for the March 14 leadership .
Although the coalition won national elections this past summer – and with this victory , the opportunity to form a government – the opposition compelled the majority , led by Rafiq Hariri ’s son Saad , to establish a national unity government to include members of the Shi’ite militia and provide the organization with preponderant influence .
Strange bedfellows indeed .
Worse , in the months following the election , the March 14 coalition , which had remained fairly stable since its establishment in 2005 , started to fray as its leading international backers in Washington and Riyadh sought rapprochement with Damascus .
Consequently , in recent months both Saad Hariri and the March 14 coalition ’s influential Druse leader Walid Jumblatt have looked to mend fences with Hizbullah and Syria .
In the case of Jumblatt , the price for this accommodation has been to apologize for his anti-Syrian disposition of recent years , request forgiveness from Syria ’s Bashar al - Assad regime , and embrace – at least rhetorically – Hizbullah ’s “ resistance . ” Given the IIIC ’s change of focus to Hizbullah , Jumblatt sensed that implicating the militia in the crime could present a threat to the fragile state ’s stability .
While the Druse leader has not repudiated the tribunal publicly , he appears to be hoping that indictments will not be forthcoming .
For Rafiq ’s son Saad , the calculations are different .
As the currentleader of Lebanon ’s Sunni community , Saad cannot afford politically toforgive and forget the reported transgressions of Hizbullah .
While Saaddemonstrated a sense of pragmatism by visiting Syria this pastDecember , the prospect of forgiving his father ’s killers would be lesspalatable .
In addition to domestic considerations , Hariri and hisgovernment ’s support ( or lack thereof ) for the tribunal could have animpact on Lebanon ’s foreign relations .
Because the tribunal wasestablished by the UN , if the government fails to meet its obligations , then Beirut could encounter bilateral difficulties with Washington and Europe .
Clearly , the government of Lebanon is not in a position – and likelywould not be expected – to render subpoenaed Hizbullah suspects to theIIIC .
But how would the UN respond if Hizbullah were able to engineerthe defunding of Lebanon ’s $ 23 million annual financial obligation tothe tribunal from the state ’s Ministry of Justice ?
With two years remaining in its current mandate , the IIIC will probablyissue indictments by the end of this year .
Given the attendant risks , should the tribunal indict even low - level operatives , it is doubtfulthat Hizbullah will allow the accused to live , much less stand trial .
If you have been in a car accident , injured on the job , or been injured or harmed due to the fault of someone else , you may feel that you ’re on your own when it comes to picking up the pieces .
Medical bills , funeral costs , and being out of work due to injury can all quickly accumulate during this difficult time .

For days no planes have taken off or landed across the UK because of the Icelandic volcano .
This has inconvenienced holidaymakers , businesses and schools .
How would we cope if the ban went on and on ?
At the moment air travel is virtually all by engines powered by kerosene .
One day kerosene - like every other fossil fuel - will run out .
So does the effect of the ash cloud hanging over northern Europe give us a valuable insight into what the world would be like with dramatically reduced or non-existent aviation ?
How would the UK cope ?
TOURISM
We have come to base our holidays around air travel
" I think you'd be talking about going to a situation like the 1950s , when planes were very much the preserve of the upper classes because it was extremely expensive to fly , " says a spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents , Abta .
The main impact would be on long - haul travel .
But this would be partly offset by short - haul breaks , to mainland Europe , thanks to improved high - speed train links or ferries .
Then again , many of us might just stay at home more .
Figures show that the lion 's share of tourism revenue in the UK actually comes from domestic holidaymakers , compared with inbound visitors .
We 'd hope that people would take the opportunity to visit the whole of Britain in a way they would n't consider doing normally
Visit Britain spokesman
Some categories of tourism would be squashed by the demise of the plane .
The foreign weekend break to anywhere other than a small segment of north - western Europe would no longer be viable .
But to the environmentally - minded that might not be a bad thing .
In 2009 , 30 million people visited the UK from overseas , and three - quarters of them travelled by plane .
Strip away air travel , and it would inevitably change the shape of the tourism industry , but not all for the worse , says a spokesman for Visit Britain , the organisation responsible for promoting tourism here .
" Although fewer people would be coming in , we'd hope that people would take the opportunity to visit the whole of Britain in a way they would n't consider doing normally , " says the spokesman .
One of the biggest concerns might be a potential loss in revenue generated by foreign tourists .
While visitors to the UK from other countries outnumber Americans , those from the US spend the most - £ 2.2 bn a year .
Take away air travel and that revenue seam would vastly diminish .
FOOD Exotic fruit and fresh chillies often come by air
The good news in a flight - less world is that Britain would still get enough to eat .
Moreover , it would still get its share of tropical fruit and vegetables .
" The impact is not massive .
We only import 1.5 % of all our fruit and veg by air , " says Michael Barker , fresh foods editor at the Grocer magazine .
Tesco goes along with this picture , saying less than 1 % of all its stock comes by air .
At the higher end of the market , Waitrose also says the proportion is tiny .
Specific examples might include fresh mangoes from Ghana , asparagus from Peru and papayas .
They are not exactly staples of the British diet .
Much of the food that comes from abroad , comes on " reefers " , special refrigerated ships , or in refrigerated containers on ordinary ships .
If you need an out - of - season apple from New Zealand , it comes on a ship .
Within Europe , much of the distance from field to plate will be covered by road and rail .
And of course , there has been continuous pressure in the past few years from environmentalists to eat more local and seasonal food .
But one thing we really do need planes for is the UK 's floral industry .
Many of our flowers come from Africa , particularly Kenya , and they are much more perishable than most other produce .
The industry would have to be radically reshaped to cope with the loss of aviation , says Jason Rodgers , retail director of the British Florist Association .
More than 80 % of the flowers sold by florists in the UK come through the Netherlands , which is an international nexus for auctions .
They come to the UK often by road or rail , but they will often have got to the Netherlands by air from Kenya , Zimbabwe , Ethiopia , Colombia and other supplier nations .
ENTERTAINMENT
Brushing up on his semaphore - ferry passenger Dizzee Rascal Even if there were no planes , the show would go on .
It just might look and sound a bit different .
" No air travel does n't necessarily mean no entertainment , but it could affect the kind of artists who would come and tour here " , says Matt Wooliscroft , a concert promoter for SJM concerts .
For Mr Wooliscroft , this week has shed a light on how tricky arranging tours can be without the benefits of aviation .
The Icelandic volcano has meant one of his bands , the Australian group Powderfinger , have had to reschedule their tour dates .
Some members of another act he works with , Alphabeat , are stuck in Norway , and are trying to see if there are ways they can travel overland to fulfil their UK tour commitments .
Looking at a hypothetical scenario with no planes , the Australian and US music acts would be hit the hardest , says Mr Wooliscroft .
When it comes to European artists it might not make such a dent , he explains , because most bands travel across the continent on their trusted tour buses anyway .
" For the smaller American bands , it 'd be less cost effective to tour .
For the bigger bands , if it took them a week or two to get here by boat they may not be able to afford the time to do that . "
This week has seen some celebrity spottings on ferries however , with both Whitney Houston and Dizzee Rascal making the trip to Dublin on the ferry to honour concert commitments .
Issues with air travel have played havoc with the lives of sports people
In a plane - free world , the nature of travelling by sea could fundamentally alter in terms of cost and speed , says Mr Wooliscroft , so the journey across the pond to play a gig , might not be as painful as one might imagine .
Sport needs aeroplanes .
If you take football as your example , the number of games played every season is sustained by the availability of air travel .
This week Liverpool will have played a Premiership match against West Ham on Monday , immediately started a 1,300 mile overland journey to Madrid to play a Europa League semi-final against Atletico Madrid before getting straight back on the road to get to Burnley for another Premiership match on Sunday .
It can be allowed as an exhausting one - off now , but a prolonged absence of plane travel would mean massive changes to the structure of sport .
Once upon a time cricketers spent weeks sailing to play in the Ashes in Australia , but now the game sees international cricketers fly to play 20 / 20 in India before hopping back to the UK for county cricket or off somewhere else for a test .
BUSINESS
The effect on British business would not just be in terms of tourist disruption or impossible air freight .
" We are an island nation and without that ease of use and connectivity we would be cut off , " says Gareth Elliott , senior policy adviser at the British Chambers of Commerce .
The increasingly globalised world we live in has been made possible by - among other things - the rise of air travel .
Video conferencing has made it possible to hold meetings without leaving the comfort of your office , but for many critical deals and projects , a face - to - face meeting is necessary .
Aviation is vital - this is a high value knowledge economy where you need to move people
Gareth Elliott
BCC " People want to meet each other , " says Mr Elliott .
" They want to be able to greet and shake hands . "
" Sometimes it is as simple as seeing goods you are buying or selling .
You need to speak to the people who are doing it , gain their trust . "
There are circumstances where nothing else will do .
No matter how convincing the balance sheets , how regular the video conferences and how trusted the middle men , a Far East business person is not going to buy a business in the UK without coming here first to check it out .
A big deal may require a series of visits by different people .
Having to go by ship or not at all would impede that process .
And the change in the nature of industry in the UK makes air travel more important than ever before .
" As we have moved up the value chain , consultancy has grown significantly in terms of the share of exporting our skills to other countries .
This is a high value knowledge economy where you need to move these people . "
Location , location ... in this case , down the road from Heathrow He gives the example of ARM Holdings , which designs processor chips .
" They need to move people rather than goods .
Aviation is vital .
If you look at some of the UK 's biggest businesses they are always located within easy reach of an airport . "
Pharmaceutical and consumer goods giant GlaxoSmithkline is a case in point - siting itself next to the motorway that leads to Heathrow airport , he says .
It is where it is to be near Heathrow , and so connected with the world .
But for Prof Helen Walker , an expert in sustainable supply chains and corporate social responsibility at Warwick Business School , the insight we are currently having into a Britain without flight is a useful exercise .
" We have in the last 10 , 20 , 30 years been moving increasingly towards off - shoring our manufacturing to drive down costs .
We have got increasingly complex global supply chains .
" If we are reliant on suppliers in other countries , it is necessary to have multiple sourcing strategies . "
She concurs with the analysis of the UK 's changing economic base .
" Britain as a nation has become more a service sector nation .
That makes us vulnerable . "
THE GOOD SIDE
Many residents are sick of the sight and sound of these
It 's important not just to think about what we would lose if air travel was to come to an end .
There are those who would welcome just such a scenario .
" Of course a complete halt in air transport would be dramatic , but transport by water and land would re-emerge and essentially suffice , " says John Stewart , chairman of HACAN Clearskies , which campaigns to mitigate the impact of aircraft in London and the South East .
" We would lead more localised lives - communities have become dispersed with the invention of the motor car and even more so now that we use aeroplanes . "
The group is not campaigning for an end to planes , but their enforced absence has been a bonus in the last few days for many residents near to airports , he says .
" For the first time in years they have had a sequence of five or six good nights ' sleep , and they feel calmer for it . "
A lady of 60 e-mailed him , saying : " For the first time in decades [ I 'm ] able to sit out in the garden for more than 20 minutes at a time and linger over the sound of the birds and there is n't the feeling that they will start again soon , fearing a plane is going to come and take it all away . "
Additional reporting by Ian Haigh Below is a selection of your comments
While the points raised in this article are very important , I feel you have left out one major area : war .
The modern military machine of the western world completely relies on air superiority , and the ability to be able to move by air .
Cullum Welch , Milton Keynes I was born , raised and still live under the flight path into Manchester Airport .
For 53 years the noise of aircraft has blighted my life .
I 'd wager that everyone who lives in Stockport in the east or Mobberley and Knutsford in the west has enjoyed the most peaceful week of their lives .
We have n't missed the planes one iota .
Long and hard may Iceland 's volcanoes erupt .
Paul Reid , Stockport , Cheshire A slightly flawed argument , as the proposition was that kerosene would run out :
If that was the case , then the shipping would be stopped as they ran out of diesel and kerosene too .
Ben , Coventry , UK Please , please , please .
Not ALL flights in the UK have been banned .
Sport aviation , such as the microlighting run by my flying school , is operating normally - except that customers think it is n't because all they hear about is that " all UK airspace is closed " .
Colin MacKinnon , Strathaven , South Lanarkshire Perhaps vacuum transport will now become economic .
It is the large - scale equivalent of the tubes used in large stores to send capsules of money etc. to the accounts departments .
In theory , the journey from the UK to New York would take less than 30 minutes in a large diameter plastic pipe suspended from floats on the surface of the Atlantic .
Passengers would be accommodated in a capsule within the tube being propelled into the vacuum by atmospheric pressure behind it .
Not a new idea but one that should be investigated again .
Johnny , Cardiff Organ transplantation would certainly take a hit .
Human tissue is only viable for a short period of time after being removed from a body , and with no air transit , the people in the greatest need may not be able to get organs from the other side of the country .
Julia Kite , London , UK Surely , if this situation did look likely to continue indefinitely , then at last people would see sense about bringing back airships .
Modern , high - speed airships - safer , cheaper , greener and cleaner than planes , maybe a bit slower , but far better for the world in the long run .

The people at the Smithsonian Institution do nothing halfway .
So when they boast of being the world 's largest museum complex and research organization , they have some pretty impressive stats to prove it .
As of 2009 , the Smithsonian 's vast collections encompassed some 137 million artifacts , objects , artworks and specimens .
Interestingly , the huge majority of those are all part of the massive scientific collections amassed by the National Museum of Natural History -- to the tune of more than 126 million [ source : Smithsonian Institution ] .
Sadly , though , even the most avid visitors wo n't see anything close to that number of national relics in their lifetimes ; although the Smithsonian Institution encompasses 19 museums and galleries ( and one zoo , of course -- that 's about 1,800 animals ) it can fit less than 2 percent of its immense holdings into exhibits at any one time [ source : Smithsonian Institution ] .
Most resides in storage and is n't accessible to the general public , although it's an initiative of the current Smithsonian leadership to create an online digital archive of all 137 million items so that anyone can browse at will .

Most of what the Smithsonian acquires comes by way of donations , although only a small portion of the plethora of proffered objects is actually accepted .
Staff at the Institution evaluates items carefully to determine if they truly enhance existing collections -- and are worth preserving for future generations -- which can be a very challenging task .
But the quest to document all the important aspects of American life ( and pretty much everything else ) continues .
You can read about some of the odder cultural relics that have been collected over the years in 5 Strange Things in the Smithsonian 's Collection .
Despite the fact that the Smithsonian Institution is decidedly American , it was founded by a British scientist who had never set foot in the country , nor , apparently , had any American acquaintances .
Even his personal opinion and knowledge of the nation are largely unknown .
On the next page , we 'll find out how this unlikely sounding scenario led to the founding of one of the most important repositories of knowledge and culture on the planet .

Those screening positive for possible depression ( CES - D score > 16 ) had higher chocolate consumption ( 8.4 servings per month ) than those not screening positive ( 5.4 servings per month ) ( P = .004 )
When Dina Khiry is feeling a bit down , she reaches for chocolate .
" I like Reese 's peanut butter cups , Hershey 's bars , and chocolate cake batter , " says the 24 - year - old public relations associate .
" I feel better in the moment -- and then worse later on , when I realize that I just consumed thousands of calories . "

this is going to turn out great
(1)
From the Abstract Oh god , please , I need a drink .
The authors are very careful to assure everyone that they do n't mean to imply that chocolate causes depression , this is just an association .
Let 's not jump to conclusions .
II .
Chocolate lovers ' are more depressive , ' say experts - BBC The More Chocolate You Eat , the Higher Your Risk of Depression , Study Hints -- ABC News Chocolate And Depression Go Hand In Hand - CNN .
First sentence : Does anyone understand that there is barely any chocolate in any of those chocolates ?
Even the Hershey 's Bar , which has the highest of all of them , has 10 % chocolate liquor ( smashed cacao beans . )
And if the box does n't say " milk chocolate , " then all bets are off .
White chocolate has plenty of cocoa butter , but no chocolate solids .
And no caffeine , theobromine , or flavinoids .
Still counts , though , right ?
And see the phrase " cocoa processed with alkali " in the ingredients of " chocolate cake batter " ?
Alkalinization ( makes it easier to mix ) drains the cocoa of the flavinoids .
Is it going to " work " the same ?
That 's like saying " rum processed with fire " will have the same mood stabilizing effects .
IT DOESN'T .
I'VE TRIED IT .
The study , as best as I can tell , did not ask them what kind of chocolate they were eating , it only measured " ounces of chocolate candy . "
Is an ounce of chocolate covered cocoa beans the same as an ounce of Hershey 's Krackel , which has no cocoa butter ( all vegetable oil ) ?
The only thing they have in common is a disdain for fair trade .
Can you imagine if someone did a study about mood and alcohol consumption , and measured it as " ounces of an alcoholic beverage " but did n't specify beer , wine , spirits , or rubbing ?
III .
On the one hand we have no idea how much chocolate was in a serving , if there was any at all .
On the other hand we have " depression . "
What 's a CES -D
It 's a 20 question 0 - 3 survey that people answer about their mood over the past week .
Think about this .
The scale does n't diagnose depression at all ; you could have had 30 suicide attempts in the past year and happen to have had some sex this week and come out fine on the inventory ; or , you could have been the merriest gal in the whole wide world until your stupid boyfriend dragged you to see Avatar and now you 're calling a hotline .
So ?
Can you really link a chronic behavior ( e.g. eating chocolate ) with a static observation of mood over one single week ?
I mean , I know you , but should n't there be some kind of law ?
IIb .
Each of the 20 questions are scored :
How depressed are you if you answer 1 for each , total =20 ?
Not very ?
Then why , in order to show increased chocolate is associated with increased depression , do they use the binary standard of > 16 and < 16 ?
Worse : So let me rewrite the abstract : " in a study of people who were not depressed , people who were more not depressed last Thursday than others have been eating a little bit less of something they thought may have smelled like chocolate .
" III .
You 're probably asking why I would bother to pick apart a relatively unimportant study .
That 's the reason .
Why is it in one of the most important medical journals ?
Does it answer any questions ?
No .
Does it direct future experiments ?
No .
Does it completely confuse an already confused public , who only yesterday were told that just the right amount of mercury in your diet is awesome , only to have scienticians later correct that to silver ?
Let 's review : uncontrolled use of the word " chocolate " +unclear metric for assessing consumption of what little chocolate is in the Peanut Butter Cup+vague definition of depression offered to a public that already thinks " depression " means something else + illogical link between chronic behavior and time x + three reviewers + one editor +article inand all the free press you could ever want .
Of course there was !
Thank GOD , thanks be to GOD -- this study was free of the corrupting poison of Big Pharma .
In your face , Pfizer !
Science can dress up in its sexiest minidress and strut confidently down the dark alley of ignorance and prejudice , unafraid and unmolested because it is protected by the enveloping goodness of the NIH .
You go , girl !----- Hershey's , et al , petitioned the FDA and EU to allow them to change the definition of " milk chocolate " to allow for the substitution of vegetable oil for cocoa butter .
The FDA said no , but the EU thought it would be awesome idea .
To emphasize : not simply change the ingredients , but to change the
Living in California , the central hub of housing bubble mania , I have come to realize that many people that overpaid for homes are now quickly shifting their mindset to one of non-payment revolt .
With the 24 hours news cycle and instant viral financial information , many are now realizing that strategically defaulting is n’t such a bad option anymore .
In fact , this is now a significant strategy for many .
The corrupt bankers and Wall Street have set the example so people figure why should n’t they follow the same path ?
But the problem with that is someone still ends up paying .
And that is the prudent middle class .
Look at it this way .
We have 51 million homes with a mortgage .
Over 44 million Americans are paying their mortgage diligently .
Yet our economy is screwed because we are bailing out the bankers and Wall Street but also giving incentives to many others to walk away from their home or game the current bailout structure .
Let us look at the current U.S. mortgage market first :
Source : Census , MBA
The latest data tells us that over 14 percent of all U.S. mortgages are either 30 + days late or in some stage of foreclosure .
In other words , 7.2 million people are not paying their mortgages .
Yet banks are turning out record profits even though they are bleeding in their real estate cash - flow .
Now let us run a hypothetical here .
The median mortgage payment of those 51 million mortgages is $ 1,514 .
This is actual stimulus for people if you do n’t pay that each month .
If you are n’t paying your mortgage you just relieved yourself of your biggest monthly commitment .
So let us run a rough number :
$ 1,514 x 7.2 million = $ 10,931,916,697
So this frees up some $ 10 billion each month ( this is a rough number ) .
This seems close to what Mark Zandi has calculated :
“ ( Zero Hedge ) No , not crazy .
With some 6 million homeowners not making mortgage payments ( some loans are in trial mod programs and paying something but still in delinquency or default status ) , this is probably freeing up roughly $ 8 billion in cash each month .
Assuming this cash is spent ( not too bad an assumption ) , it amounts to nearly one percent of consumer spending .
The saving rate is also much lower as a result .
The impact on spending growth is less significant as that is a function of the change in the number of homeowners not making payments .
I ’m not sure I would say this is juicing up spending , but resulting in more spending than would be the case otherwise . ”
Part of the jump in recent spending has come from people flat out not paying on their mortgage .
I can tell you of a case of someone that bought a home here in California .
They paid $ 700,000 for a home that is now worth $ 500,000 ( if they are lucky ) .
That is typical .
What is also typical is that they took on an exotic mortgage for the full $ 700,000 amount .
Last year , they realized that they would n’t be able to sell the home and would n’t be able to make their new modified home payment .
So once it modified late last year , they stopped paying .
Yet they had the money to pay .
They explained that the bank would n’t deal with them until they missed a few payments .
Now , the bank is throwing itself like an obsessed lover to help them “ modify ” their loan .
The terms now seem nice but they want to negotiate for more .
You have the banking criminals using taxpayer money to negotiate with people that drive around in a leased Mercedes SUV and BMW .
Does this sound like the poor grandma being kicked out of her humble home ?
Apparently I ’m not the only one hearing and seeing this :
“ ( WSJ ) Some borrowers are being helped by the Obama administration ’s foreclosure - prevention program and other modification efforts .
Irma Bravo , the owner of a cleaning service in San Diego , recently received a loan workout that lowers the monthly payment on her $ 522,000 mortgage to $ 1,736 from nearly $ 5,000 .
“ It ’s a big , big relief , ” Ms. Bravo says . ”
Did you get that ?
A $ 5,000 mortgage payment was pushed down to $ 1,736 .
Now would n’t you , one of the 44 million prudent Americans want to have this kind of sweetheart deal ?
If you want this deal you have to imitate your local crony banker and give them the middle finger and stop paying .
Suddenly , they ’ll do handstands and back flips to lower your payment .
The Wall Street system has perverted the foundation of our economy .
Do I begrudge the people doing this ?
Not really .
But what I do resent is the fact that banks are using the trillions of dollars in taxpayer money to make these deals work .
If they wanted to use their own money , so be it .
But that is not the case .
And we have many people that fall in this category :
Source : Calculated Risk
I also wanted to get this data specifically for California :
So today you have roughly 798,000 California mortgage holders not paying their mortgage for a variety of reasons .
Clearly the main reason is the economy is horrible .
But a large number are taking advantage of the situation .
The median home payment in the state is $ 2,384 .
Let us do the math :
$ 2,384 x 798,832 = $ 1,904,414,716
So of the $ 10 billion in non-payer stimulus , California receives roughly 20 percent of the cut .
And what are people doing with this money ?
“ ( CNBC )
The person had an $ 1,880.00 monthly mortgage payment on which they ’d defaulted , but said person ’s monthly bank statement showed payments to a tanning salon , nail spa , liquor stores , DirecTV bill with premium charges , and $ 1,700.00 in retail purchases from The Gap , Old Navy , Home Depot , Sears , etc . ”
Well I ’m glad some people have their priorities straight .
The fact of the matter is the bulk of Americans , the middle class , are being screwed by the banks , Wall Street , and also the current bailout structure .
The median home price in the U.S. hovers around $ 170,000 .
Why not cap any bailout help to mortgages at that level or less ?
Do you feel good that the folks I talked about ( who make over $ 100,000 a year by the way ) in California who have a Mercedes and BMW and continue to live in a nice home rent free are able to do so because of your taxpayer money ?
This is exactly what is happening .
No wonder why many Americans must feel like fools .
The name of the game is simple .
Get into massive debt , so much so that when you fail , you will then be able to negotiate lower terms because the government enjoys rewarding horrible behavior .
Things like this wo n’t last long because eventually , the public that is being ramrod into bailouts wakes up and revolts .
Yet this could be a few years or much longer before any of it happens .
Things have gotten so absurd that people are now calling up credit card companies and blackmailing corrupt banks saying they wo n’t pay on $ 50,000 on debt unless something changes .
In many cases , credit card companies are changing terms if you sound convincing enough .
Otherwise , if you are one of the majority who honor their debt be prepared to pay higher fees for the smaller group that are milking the system .
This is an absolute war on the middle class .
And why save when banks offer close to zero percent because of the Federal Reserve cartel ?
$ 10 billion a month freed up from not paying mortgages .
No wonder why retail spending has jumped up recently .

THE humble T - shirt may soon be strong enough to stop a speeding bullet .
Scientists in the US have developed a flexible shirt made of the same material used in tank armour , by combining carbon in the shirt with the third - hardest material on Earth , boron .
" It could even be used to produce lightweight , fuel - efficient cars and aircrafts , " Xiaodong Li , from the University of Southern Carolina , wrote in the journal Advanced Materials .
The plain white T - shirts are dipped into a boron solution , then heated in an oven at more than 1000C , which changes the cotton fibres into carbon fibres .
The carbon fibres react with the boron solution and produce boron carbide - the same material used to make bulletproof plates in armoured vests .
The resulting material was stiffer than the original cotton tee , but still flexible enough to be worn as such .
" We expect that the nanowires can capture a bullet , " Prof Li said .
But bullets are just the beginning for the new miracle material .
Prof Li said the T - shirts could also block " almost all " ultraviolet rays , and possibly life - threatening neutrons emitted from decaying radioactive material .
Possibly the most geeky thing about me , if I can pick just one thing , is that I get all tingly when I hear about new business models .
For example , I got a tingly feeling the first time I heard about iTunes .
I get the same feeling every time I buy a book in less than a minute from Amazon .
I ’m also fascinated when an improved user interface causes an entirely new product to be created from something old .
For example , auctions have been around forever , but eBay made it so easy that they created an entirely new way of doing business .
I get shivers when I see stuff like that happening , and I do n’t know why .
Business models have n’t been around long enough to affect human evolution .
I have to wonder what genetic defect I have that causes me to enjoy learning about business models as much as I enjoy food or laughing .
Maybe you noticed a new button below the Dilbert comic on the home page labeled “ License Me . ”
Now you can search for a particular strip by key word or date , click a few buttons to describe how you want to use it – for anything from a PowerPoint presentation to a web site to a publication to a coffee mug – enter some credit card information , and you ’re all legally licensed in minutes .
For example , you can license Dilbert for your business presentation for as little as $ 19.99 , which is the same as free if your boss is paying for it .
The old way of licensing Dilbert was so cumbersome that I spent a lot of time convincing people they should n’t even try .
My end of the conversation usually involved something like “ Just use it without permission and do n’t tell me about it . ”
When pressed for an explanation as to why doing such a seemingly simple thing would be a nightmare , I launched into my explanation of copyright protections , lawyers , contracts , approval processes , and all the phone calls , faxes , e-mails , and cursing involved to get a tiny license for a limited use .
It was a good way for me to experience self - loathing with a dollop of someone else loathing me at the same time .
In recent years , United Media streamlined the process , but it still involved e-mails , sometimes phone calls , explanations , contracts , and too much time .
It was never as easy as common sense demanded .
As a consequence , Dilbert was probably in second place for the most stolen item of the past 20 years , at least by businesses .
( Money was in first place . )
And who could blame anyone for using Dilbert without permission ?
I would have done the same thing .
Humans have some sort of hardwired sense of rightness , and stealing something that ’s too much of a hassle to purchase legally feels okay to most people .
I feel exactly the same way .
The License Me button is for the benefit of companies that prefer to be legal in all things .
It sets a good example .
And at long last , it is easy to be legal .
I call that a new business model .
It makes me tingle .
I swear it does .
( Note : Dilbert will always be free for personal use , such as hanging on your wall or emailing to friends . )

BEIT UMMAR , West Bank —
Residents of this Palestinian village refuse to buy the idea that the flood of raw sewage from the adjacent Israeli settlement of Kfar Etzion , that destroyed vineyards and contaminated their drinking water , was an accident .
The Israeli Civil Administration , which administers the occupied West Bank , claims the spillage was the result of an accidental power malfunction which caused excess settlement sewage to overflow onto Palestinian land .
" This was no mistake , " says a British activist who has been documenting life in the village for several months .
" The pipe was deliberately unscrewed by hand so that the sewage would spill over into Beit Ummar .
That has nothing to do with an electricity cut , " he told IPS .
Villagers standing near a completely destroyed 70,000 sq m vineyard belonging to the Sabarneh family said they believe it was a deliberate act of sabotage and part of a concerted campaign by the settlers to harass their Palestinian neighbors and vandalize their property .
Beit Ummar has been the target of a number of Israeli military raids at night last month .
Activists who have been organizing non-violent protests against the expropriation of their land for the settlements have been arrested and the village blockaded .
In a similar incident last week the Palestinian village of Bruqin , in the northern West Bank , was flooded with sewage from the nearby Ariel settlement , causing contamination of underground water and springs and damaging crops .
These incidents are part of a larger problem of scarce water resources where a Palestinian population of 2.5 million survives on 17 percent of the West Bank ’s main underground aquifer .
The remaining water is channeled towards the West Bank ’s ( including East Jerusalem ) 500,000 Israeli settlers , and into Israel proper .
The water shortage is compounded by the lack of wastewater treatment plants and inefficient treatment of waste and sewage in the Palestinian territory which fouls its water sources .
Israeli rights group B’tselem released a study last year called " Foul Play : Neglect of wastewater treatment in the West Bank . "
According to the organization , more than 90 percent of Palestinian wastewater is not treated while only 20 percent of Palestinian homes , primarily in towns and cities , are connected to sewerage systems .
Furthermore , only 81 of 121 illegal Israeli settlements are connected to wastewater treatment facilities .
Over half of the settlements ’ treatment plants are too small to treat waste effectively and are ill - equipped to handle the burgeoning settler population .
The result is continual technical breakdowns and sewage overflow .
Most of the settlements are situated on ridges and hilltops so sewage flows down towards the Palestinian villages and towns in the valleys below , contaminating their drinking water supplies and destroying their crops .
The Israeli settlers are not affected by this as they are connected to Israel ’s water supply .
The planning and building authorities in the settlements and Israeli industrial areas also ignore Jordanian building and planning laws which govern how wastewater is to be treated in the West Bank .
The B’tselem report further outlines the neglect of the territory ’s water treatment plants by the Israeli Civil Administration during the decades of occupation and the current difficulties faced by Palestinian Authority ( PA ) water officials in trying to build new wastewater treatment plants or repair the old ones .
There is currently only one wastewater treatment plant operating in the West Bank in Ramallah .
Three others have ceased to function and the PA has been unable to repair them or build new ones .
The West Bank is divided into Area A , which is under Palestinian control , Area B under joint Palestinian and Israeli control , and Area C which is under full Israeli control .
Area C comprises 60 percent of the West Bank .
Areas A and B are mostly built up with little free land available .
However , in order to move around or build new wastewater treatment plants in Area C Palestinian officials from the PA Environment Authority require building permits from the Israeli Civil Administration .
B’tselem and PA officials complain of the delays these officials face in getting building approval if they get them at all .
" There is an enormous amount of red tape and bureaucracy that Palestinian officials have to overcome before they get the permits , " says Eyal Hareuveni , the author of the B’tselem report .
" The Israeli Civil Administration says that the Palestinians do n’t provide the necessary detailed building plans as they have been instructed but I think the administration is being deliberately difficult , " Hareuveni told IPS .
Issa Moussa from the PA ’s Environmental Authority denied that the PA provided insufficient details .
" We have the case of wanting to build a new wastewater treatment plant in Tulkarem in the northern West Bank .
We provided absolutely everything requested but we were still waiting for a permit , " Moussa told IPS .
Other difficulties facing the more efficient handling of wastewater are the restrictions placed on Palestinian movement in the West Bank by the Israeli military .
This has led to increased costs for donors who support wastewater projects and who in turn have cut down on their expenditure .
A Joint Water Committee between Israel and the PA was established following the Oslo Peace Accord of 1993 , to address water issues .
One of the disputes between the sides is the Israeli insistence that settlement sewage be connected to future Palestinian wastewater treatment plants .
The Palestinians reject this as this implies that the settlements are permanent and say their refusal to approve this condition is one of the reasons for approval being withheld on the construction of wastewater plants .
With no higher authority to settle the disagreement the situation will only worsen in the future .
" Neither side seems to be making the urgent issue of water and waste treatment a priority , " Hareuveni told IPS .

This figure is consistent across countries that acknowledge sexual diversity , according to La Trobe University researcher Dr Lynne Hillier .
Most young people realise they are gay around puberty but 30 per cent know earlier .
When The Age interviewed a group of young people who completed year 12 last year at a range of Melbourne schools , most knew a few people in their year who had come out , and they believed those students were mostly accepted by their peers .
But they had also noticed that teachers were slow to clamp down on homophobic comments and , in most cases , sex-education classes did not acknowledge same - sex relationships .
Some had witnessed gay students being bullied , sometimes overtly but often in subtle ways such as through exclusion .
" The physical education teachers assumed there were no gays in the school when in fact our school had quite a few , " says Lars Osland , who finished year 12 at an independent school last year .
Dr Hillier was disappointed to find when looking at the results of the Writing Themselves in Again national survey in 2004 that , while young people reported feeling safer at school than in the 1998 survey , the level of abuse had not diminished .
Forty - four per cent of the 1749 young people surveyed reported verbal abuse ( which included threats and rumour - mongering ) and 16 per cent reported physical assault , ranging from damaged possessions to rape and hospitalisation for injuries .
These figures were unchanged since the first survey in 1998 .
" This is despite a tremendous amount of professional work done in schools , particularly with the Talking Sexual Health resources rolled out in every state , and professional development done with up to 30 teachers at a time , " she says .
" We thought the violence would have dropped but it had n't . "
Dr Hillier is now seeking 2000 same - sex attracted young people to respond to the 2010 survey ( go to wti3.org.au ) .
So far 1800 have responded but more are needed by the end of the month .
Have schools become safer in the past six years ?
Dr Hillier can't be sure , but she does know that many teachers still avoid the topic of sexual diversity , despite a requirement under state government policy to tackle it .
" There is a lot of discretion and teachers are frightened to deal with the topic , " she says .
Dr Hillier and other experts made it clear at a government roundtable in 2005 that nothing would change until teachers knew they were expected to make schools safe and that they would not be fired if a parent complained about the teacher broaching the subject .
The teacher resource Safe Schools are Effective Schools subsequently included strategies to counter homophobic bullying .
A new policy , Supporting Sexual Diversity in Schools , launched in August 2008 , says that to comply with the Victorian Equal Opportunity
Act schools must ensure students and staff do not experience homophobia or discrimination .
Schools must have continuous , proactive strategies and staff members who turn a blind eye to discrimination , homophobic abuse or sexual harassment may be held liable for authorising or assisting discrimination .
DESPITE the potential for legal action , many state schools ignore these requirements .
Independent schools , including those in the Catholic system , are not bound by these policies .
Dr Hillier puts the delayed response down to homophobia being entrenched , with teachers concerned about a parent or community backlash .
But she urges teachers to overcome these concerns , read the policy and work to counter homophobia .
" The research so clearly shows that young people who have been abused and / or have poor self - esteem relating to their sexuality are more likely to self harm , including cutting and attempted suicide .
Suicide risk is at its greatest in the months before the young person discloses their sexual orientation , " she says .
Teachers must receive professional development , says Dr Debbie Ollis , a researcher in sex education at Deakin University .
Her doctoral research shows that teachers do n't include sexual diversity in their sex education programs unless they have training and support .
More young people come out in high school now , but they do so hesitantly .
Dr Hillier says they carefully case everyone around them and look for those they think it best to confide in .
" The response is so important as this is the one person they thought they could trust , " Dr Hillier says .
" One young man told a friend on the bus and by the time he got to school everyone was laughing at him . "
Teachers should treat such disclosure as an honour and a responsibility .
Dr Hillier advises letting the young person talk about where they are at , and then suggesting groups and websites .
But approval is the most important thing .
Health and physical education teachers take sex education in most schools , and teacher trainers know that some male PE teachers are more interested in sport than in teaching sexuality , let alone in tackling topics they are uncomfortable with .
In that sense gay people are unofficially invisible in high school .
" I say to these teachers , ' Regardless of what your values are , if they go against the well - being of young people you have got to leave them at the door . ' "
Through her research Dr Hillier has come to know many young people who are too scared to tell their parents because they fear rejection .
" Another difference between homophobic bullying and other bullying is that kids can't tell their parents because then they are outing themselves .
So not only are they isolated from the school , the community , the church , they are isolated from their families and that 's why the suicide rate is so high with these young people because they are just so often left with no one . "
Seventy - five per cent of parents who were told were supportive , according to the surveys .
" There are even parents who leave their religion because it 's homophobic , but there are others who kick their kids out , " Dr Hillier says .
" These young people are more likely to become homeless . "
She urges parents to question their values because there is a chance they will have a gay child .
" I have seen the damage done to a non-heterosexual child when they hear their parents acting in homophobic ways .
They feel it 's against them .
One kid said his father stormed out of the bank cursing poofters .
He watched his parent behaving like this , and he is gay . "
She knows many parents of gay teenagers who did n't know now feel huge regret that they did not protect their child .
Young people have always faced many pressures to deny their sexuality .
Psychiatrists once deemed homosexuality a mental illness , she says , but this is no longer the case .
Religion remains a last bastion of resistance , Dr Hillier says , to what is regarded in legal and health terms as a normal part of human sexuality .
In the surveys , young people who were Christians , attended Christian schools or belonged to Christian families often wrote of feeling anguish .
" In most cases they were forced to choose between their sexuality and their religion .
In many cases the rejection of their sexuality and the embracing of their religion resulted in young people hating and harming themselves . "
Parents also put pressure on their children by saying that they will miss out on grandchildren and the child will have a lonely life and miss out on having children .
" But there is no evidence that they will miss out .
Another pressure comes from parents often being desperate to think it 's not true , and that their child will grow out of it . "
Dr Hillier counsels young people to give their parents time to get used to the idea .
" The parent also has to wear the gossip .
All of a sudden a parent will experience homophobia like their child experiences homophobia and a lot of parents will say to their kid ' do n't tell anyone ' because they are trying to protect the child and protect themselves . "
Is this for the best ?
Dr Hillier does n't think so .
" It 's hard for kids to be in the closet .
They say , ' No one knows who I am , I am carrying this big secret .
They all talk about their stuff and I can't talk about mine . '
But it can be hard to be out .
It depends on how strong kids are .
If they have parental support it makes a huge difference . "
As part of a lengthy post discussing Apple 's nearly singular focus on iPhone OS 4 over the past few months , Daring Fireball 's John Gruber reports that he is hearing that resources have been diverted from the Mac OS X team to the iPhone OS team .
Consequently , Gruber offers an " educated guess " that Mac OS X 10.7 may not be introduced to developers until mid-2011 .
A few months ago , I heard suggestions that Apple had tentative plans to release a developer beta of Mac OS X 10.7 at WWDC this June .
That is no longer the case .
Mac OS X 10.7 development continues , but with a reduced team and an unknown schedule .
It 's my educated guess that there will be no 10.7 news at WWDC this year , and probably none until WWDC 2011 .
Evidence of Apple 's work on Mac OS X 10.7 surfaced last November .
By January when Gruber reported that he was hearing of a possible developer release for Mac OS X 10.7 at Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference 2010 , usage of the next - generation operating system already seemed to be on the rise within Apple 's campus .
The time between major Mac OS X releases has been increasing as the operating system matures , with a nearly 30 - month gap between Tiger and Leopard being followed by a 22 - month wait for Snow Leopard , which Apple positioned primarily as a refinement of Leopard .
With Mac OS X Snow Leopard having been released less than eight months ago , it would not be surprising to see Mac OS X 10.7 not make its public debut until late 2011 or beyond , even without iPhone OS 4 putting pressure on development .
A new translation of a Roman victory stele , erected in April 29 BC , shows Octavian Augustus ’s name inscribed in a cartouche ( an oblong enclosure that surrounds a pharaoh ’s name ) – an honour normally reserved for an Egyptian pharaoh .
Octavian ’s forces defeated Cleopatra and Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC .
His forces captured Alexandria soon afterwards and Cleopatra committed suicide in 30 BC , marking the end of Egyptian rule .
Historians believe that although Octavian ruled Egypt after the death of Cleopatra , he was never actually crowned as an Egyptian pharaoh .
The stele was erected at a time when Octavian was still paying lip service to restoring the Roman Republic .
He would not be named “ Augustus ” by the Roman Senate until 27 BC .
In the years following that , he would gradually acquire more power .
New Translation of the Philae Victory Stele
The victory stele is written in three languages – Egyptian hieroglyphics , Latin and Greek .
It was erected by priests at the Temple of Isis at Philae , which is near the first cataract , the traditional border between Egypt and Nubia .
The Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto , Canada , has a physical model of Philae , a picture of which is being shown in this article .
The stele was commissioned by Gaius Cornelius Gallus , a Roman who was appointed to run Egypt as a province by Octavian .
It celebrates the end of the Ptolemaic kings and the defeat of the “ king of the Ethiopians . ”
It has been known to scholars for about 100 years .
However , the hieroglyphic writing is difficult to translate as the symbols are not clear on the stone .
Previous work suggested that Gallus ’s name had been written in a cartouche .
The new translation work was done by a team that includes Professor Martina Minas - Nerpel of Swansea University in Wales .
They recently published a book , The Trilingual Stela of C. Cornelius Gallus from Philae , but are unable to release a picture of the stele at the moment .
Professor Minas - Nerpel gave a presentation at the University of Toronto recently and Heritage Key interviewed her afterwards .
Minas - Nerpel said that there should be no mistake – on this victory monument Octavian was certainly given treatment reserved for a pharaoh .
“ The name of Octavian is written in a cartouche – he ’s treated as any other Egyptian king , ” she said .
The translation certainly sounds like it ’s for a pharaoh .
Here ’s a snippet :
Regnal year one , 4th month of the winter season day 20 ( 16 April 29 BC ) under the majesty the Horus , the perfect child , mighty arm ruler [ of rulers ] chosen of Ptah Kaisaros ( Octavian ) living forever ….
How Does a Roman Emperor Become a Pharaoh ?
So the question is why was Octavian named as pharaoh in this inscription ?
Historians do n’t believe that he was ever crowned as the Pharaoh of Egypt .
Professor Minas - Nerpel believes that it was n’t Octavian who insisted on having this honour , instead it was Egyptian priests .
For 3,000 years there had been an Egyptian pharaoh , they could not simply do away with the position .
“ They had to have an acting pharaoh – the only acting pharaoh ( possible ) under Octavian was Octavian , ” she said .
“ The priests needed to see him as a pharaoh otherwise their understanding of the world would have collapsed . ”
Of course that ’s not to say that Octavian did n’t condone the idea on some level .
He needed Egypt ’s grain and to get access to it he needed the Egyptian people to not rebel against him .
“ He needed to have a calm province and the key element to keeping the province calm were the priests – they were key to the population , ” said Minas - Nerpel .
“ The priests needed to see him as a pharaoh otherwise their understanding of the world would have collapsed . ”
This stele would not be the only time Roman rulers had their names written in a cartouche .
Minas - Nerpel said that there are examples of Roman Emperors having their names written in that form as late as the 3rd century AD .
She also said there is one other example of Octavian ’s name being written in a cartouche – a gateway on the island of Kalabsha in Southern Egypt – that also appears to date to on or shortly after 30 BC .
The Downfall of Gaius Cornelius Gallus
Gaius Cornelius Gallus was a soldier , administrator and poet – he wrote four books of poetry dedicated to a mistress named “ Lycrois . ”
Despite the fact that Gallus was not a senator , Octavian turned to him to rule Egypt after Cleopatra committed suicide in 30 BC .
Gallus administered Egypt until he was recalled to Rome in 27 BC .
The Roman writer Cassius Dio wrote in the 3rd century AD that :
Cornelius Gallus was encouraged to insolence by the honour shown him .
Thus , he indulged in a great deal of disrespectful gossip about Augustus and was guilty of many reprehensible actions besides ; for he not only set up images of himself practically everywhere in Egypt , but also inscribed upon the pyramids a list of his achievements .
The new translation of the victory stele shows that Gallus treated Octavian with respect , but that he was n’t afraid to brag about his own accomplishments .
One part of the stele reads that he was :
First prefect of Alexandria of Egypt , vanquisher of the Theban insurrection with ( in ) fifteen days .
He also says on the monument that he defeated an army in Nubia :
After the army was lead beyond the Nile cataract , after envoys of the king of the Ethiopians were heard near Philae and after this king was received into custody … ( Gallus ) gave a donation to ( the ) hereditary gods and Nile helper .
If that was n’t enough Gallus had himself drawn onto the stele .
He is shown riding a horse , about to slaughter what looks like an enemy soldier .
This sort of bragging may have been his undoing in the long run .
Minas - Nerpel said that Octavian would not have wanted it advertised that there were rebellions in Egypt that needed to be put down by Gallus .
“ Presumably he ( Gallus ) was to powerful and he did n’t sort of give enough respect to Octavian – that might have been the reason , ” she said .
Cassius Dio records what happened after he was recalled to Rome in 27 BC :
He was accused by Valerius Largus , his comrade and intimate , and was disfranchised by Augustus , so that he was prevented from living in the emperor ’s provinces .
After this had happened , many others attacked him and brought numerous indictments against him .
The senate unanimously voted that he should be convicted in the courts , exiled , and deprived of his estate , that his estate should be given to Augustus , and that the senate itself should offer sacrifices .
Overwhelmed by grief at this , Gallus committed suicide before the decrees took effect .
Later today , the editor of the Guardian , Alan Rusbridger , will hold an open meeting for staff to discuss what political position the paper should adopt in its election editorial .
Since 1945 the Guardian has supported all three main political parties .
It is the only national newspaper with no proprietor and free from any party political allegiance .
So the paper is , very unusually in the British press , entirely free to decide for itself on which party , if any , to support .
It is a tradition on the paper that anyone on the editorial staff can come to a pre-election meeting and openly argue the issues .
The meetings are a consultative forum – for taking soundings , rather than deciding the leader line by vote – but they can have a significant influence .
This year , for the first time , the Guardian has decided to hear not only from its staff , but from its readers and web users , too .
So tell us who – or what – the paper should back in its election editorial as polling day approaches .
The editor has agreed to have at least a representative sample of your views heard at our meeting .

• More election coverage from Cif at the polls
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday ordered a rural Mississippi school district to comply with a nearly 40 - year - old order and halt long - disputed practices that led to racial segregation in its schools .
The Justice Department accused the Walthall County School District in rural Mississippi of annually permitting more than 300 students , most of them white , to transfer to a school outside of their residential area , shifting its racial makeup .
Further , administrators at three other schools grouped most of the white students into their own classrooms “ resulting in significant numbers of segregated all - black classrooms at each grade level , ” the U.S. government said in a court filing .
The case comes in a state that was at the heart of the U.S. civil rights movement in the 1960s .
In 1964 , three civil rights workers were murdered in Mississippi , an incident that helped prompt Congress to pass a law banning racial segregation in schools , work and public places .
The school district was ordered in 1970 to stop segregating its schools .
But in the late 1980s officials were confronted by the Justice Department with concerns about student transfers to other schools that undermined the desegregation efforts .
While the district made some changes in the early 1990s , the Justice Department said the practices continued and the schools became “ significantly more segregated . ”
The district did not respond to the government ’s lawsuit seeking reforms .
In fact , the county school board in 2009 rejected a tentative settlement with the government that would have overhauled the district ’s transfer policy and prevented students being assigned to classrooms based on race .
LIMIT TRANSFERS
On Tuesday , U.S. District Judge Tom Lee , in Jackson , Mississippi , ordered the school district to significantly limit transfers .
Lee also ordered the district to stop assigning students to classrooms that resulted in segregation , demanding that it use a software program to randomly assign them .
“ It is unacceptable for school districts to act in a way that encourages or tolerates the resegregation of public schools , ” said Thomas Perez , assistant attorney general of the Justice Department ’s Civil Rights Division .
In 2008 , the Walthall district had about 2,550 students -- of whom about 64 percent were black and 35 percent were white .
At four schools , less than a quarter of the students were white while at least 73 percent of the students were black in 2008 , according to the government court filing .
In 1992 , the racial makeup of those schools was between 59 percent and 70 percent black and at least 30 percent white .
Meanwhile at another school , Salem Attendance Center , 66 percent of the students were white while a third were black students in 2008 .
That was a dramatic shift from 1992 when a majority , 58 percent , were black and 42 percent were white .
The change in the school racial makeup was not because of population shifts , but rather “ the product of unlawful district transfer policies that permit hundreds of white students ” to transfer each year , the Justice Department said .
The superintendent for the district declined to comment on the judge ’s ruling .

Advertisement Records from an inquest into the notorious 1881 shootout at the OK Corral in Tombstone , Arizona , have been discovered in a court storeroom .
The scrawled notes are a transcript of a witness statement about the shootout between lawmen including Wyatt Earp and three outlaws , who were killed .
The documents were last seen about 1960 when they were photocopied .
Researchers hope that restoration by archivists will reveal margin notes not visible on the reproductions .
But the notes are unlikely to shed much new light on the incident , as researchers already had access to the copies .
The pages will soon be digitised and made available online to researchers and Wild West history buffs .
Thirty - second firefight
The yellowed pages , said to be as brittle as potato crisps , were discovered in a manila envelope by court staff assigned to clean out a storage room at Cochise County superior court in Bisbee , Arizona , about 23 miles ( 37 km ) south of Tombstone , the Arizona Daily Star newspaper reported .
On 26 October , 1881 , Wyatt , Virgil and Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday confronted Ike and Billy Clanton and Frank and Tom McLaury behind the OK Corral .
The town of Tombstone celebrates its part in Wild West history The McLaurys and Billy Clanton were killed in the ensuing 30 - second firefight .
The incident and subsequent investigation were covered heavily in the news media at the time .
The fight entered the folklore of the Wild West and made heroes of the Earps .
It has been portrayed numerous times in film and in literature .
Nearly 130 years after the shootout , it remains unclear which party fired first and whether all of the outlaws were armed .
The Earps and Holliday said they were defending themselves , but supporters of the dead men said they were murdered .
The document appears to include testimony by William Claiborn , who a historian identified as a friend of the three dead men , according to the Associated Press news agency .
It was recorded as part of an inquiry by a local official into the shootout .
The document indicates that Doc Holliday was carrying a weapon concealed under a long coat .
The town of Tombstone celebrates its part in Wild West history , attracting tourists with re-enactments of the gun battle .
Earlier this month Arizona Governor Jan Brewer , a Republican , signed into law a measure allowing Arizonans to carry concealed firearms without a permit .

On Tuesday , March 16 , Stephen Harper sat down to a Canadian political first — a Prime Ministerial YouTube interview .
Nearly 200,000 votes were cast for thousands of questions .
Now , considering the medium for this session I think most of us can guess what the top voted question would be concerning , no ?
Well , for all you living in Canada ’s “ drug free zones ” I ’ll fill you in : “ A majority of Canadians , when polled , say they believe marijuana should be legal for adults , just like alcohol .
Why do n’t you end the war on drugs and focus on violent criminals ? ”
Stephen , like any great sophist , began by questioning the legitimacy of the sources that the curious Canadian was speaking of and replied that , “ There are different polls on this subject that show different things . ”
Immediately after this he veered the question into emotion land and began speaking of his concern for his two young children and the kind of environment his wishes for them to grow up in .
A perfect way to avoid answering what was really being asked , if I do say so myself .
Keep in mind that I am fully aware of the “ preaching to the choir ” aspect of discussing marijuana with a university student body .
However , this article is not about that , rather it is concerning the failure of our Prime Minister to offer a coherent argument for his stance on the subject .
Harper goes on to note — by some kind of intense witchcraft and wizardry — that legalizing marijuana would increase the violence created by the drug trade and international cartels .
I will not go into the hundreds of sound arguments that indicate otherwise , but we really must give this man a tip of the cap for keeping a straight face when spewing this nonsense .
To think the man who sat on a stage and sang “ I get high with a little help from my friends ” could spread such misinformation .
Clearly , we do not have a friend in the current government of Canada .
Harper continued with his flawless logic : “ The reason drugs are illegal is because they are bad .
And even if these things were legalized , I can predict with a lot of confidence that these would never be respectable businesses run by respectable people . ”
So , following this line of reasoning , it would be fair to say that alcohol , tobacco or any other legal drugs are inherently good because of the fact the are legal ?
Sweet .
Now that I ’m aware of this bit of information I ’m off to drown myself in liquor , all the while knowing I will remain a reputable man .
Prime Minster Harper ’s answer to the top voted question was laughable .
How I wish I could have been there to point out the true nature of what was being asked .
He did a perfect tip - toe around it offering only fluff and deception .
It is such a shame that this medium was deemed democratic .
He was allowed to shrug off the question as nonsense because of the undemocratic nature of this session .
Democracy is not question - and - answer , or vote every once in a while .
Democracy is action and dialogue !
Now , stop smoking pot my fellow students , for God ’s sake .
Do n’t you want to remain respectable human beings ?

UPDATE :
Hi all .
I was one of the people moaning about the woeful volume levels on my T - Mobile UK Desire .
I solved the issue by flashing with a generic ROM ( although it seems to be a Virgin Media ROM judging from the bookmarks )
Anyway , being in the UK I did n't have access to the free Google Navigation ... I even gave the Brut hack a try but uninstalled it due to it 's unstable nature and lack of features .
Well , I 've just been prompted to update to Maps 4.1.1 and I now have navigation .
Fully functional , with the arrow and the street name ( both missing in the hacked version ) Is this a general roll out by Google ?
Is this now available to everyone , even on branded ROMs , or is this an added bonus of flashing a generic ROM ?
Let me knowGoogle officially verify Navigation : http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/mobile/navigation/
First and foremost , thank you John McCain .
Sarah Palin would have gone down in a cloud of dust and indictments worthy of an Illinois governor had she not been elevated to the national stage by a shaky , panicked McCain team during the 2008 Presidential election .
Positively prescient in selection , McCain 's choice has left the nation with an impulsive , irresponsible , corrupt , photogenic ' leader ' of the born again Know Nothing party .
Democratic candidates have to proceed carefully when prompted for their views on Alaska 's half term governor ; too much glee would be unseemly .
The recently passed S.B. 1070 is a Sarah Palin - like piece of legislation ; unlawful when compared to constitutional standards , directly offensive to half of Arizona , idiotic in the eyes of half of Republicans on the national level , and fodder for motivational speech of the first order to Democrats everywhere .
Boycotts of the already stressed businesses in the state began at once and many which would have failed no matter what given our current economic mess will now be blaming their failure on the 32 members of their legislature who brought this shame upon the state .
The brewing third in the trifecta of fail , Tea Party Senatorial candidate J.D. Hayworth , wo n't truly begin to deliver unless elected , but let 's consider what one seditionist Senator might be able to do .
Secret blocks on everything ?
Check .
Real live reading the phone book filibusters ?
Check .
Leaking lunacy , a constant distraction in the news cycle , a vehicle for the nutty 5 % of America to thwart the will of the other 95 % ?
Check .
The cherry on top would be the 2012 wingnut Presidential dream team of Palin / Hayworth being caught in the midst of a horizontal debate on the vertical integration of religious teachings throughout our public education system .
Do n't even try to visualize who comes out on top - because our nation would never recover .
Now I 'm grateful to Arizona for providing us Sarah Palin , personifying the incompetence and certainty of religious fanaticism in a package the media just can't leave alone .
And I 'm thrilled by the service the Arizona legislature has done , dragging the immigration reform issue out front and center in a fashion that none can ignore .
But I 'm not sure the nation can stand six years of willful misgovernance led by J.D. Hayworth and cheered on by every right wing extremist group that has slipped inside the Tea Party 's wire .
Yeah , that 's no joke , they 've got Klansmen , Storm Front , militant militia ; every form of reactionary , regressive , racist slime you could imagine , and their leadership is struggling to deal .
Fox News ginned up the Tea Party and now are a bit puzzled that their creation has taken on a life of its own .
RNC operatives launched the Tea Party Express , which was promptly sniffed out and disdained by their rank and file .
The real Tea Party , as the dust clears , seems to be the Republican base ; white , middle aged , educated , and mad beyond recovery at the betrayal they 've faced at the hands of the wealthiest 1 % , but as yet unwilling to see that their ideology is the cause of the grief rather than any sort of solution .
I 'm also grateful on a small , personal scale for the opportunity Arizona provides .
Spedwybabs volunteered to help with Netroots outreach for the Democratic Senate campaign in Arizona .
I 'm up on these happenings because I 'm sitting in the passenger seat , listening to her cackle Wicked Witch of the West style , as she and I get various bits of news as we make our way towards D.C. and The Great Skulk , a long awaited Progressive non-media event .
Oh , we could try and get the media to pay attention to the historic birthing of a new media channel driven by citizen journalists , and of the bones of a Progressive machine beginning to flesh out as more and more of the primary action and young , rising candidates start using the ( loosely ) coordinated group that began forming at Netroots Nation last year .
But why would we waste our time ?
If 200,000 immigration reform marchers get ignored in favor of fewer than a thousand kooks cursing and spitting on heroic , long serving Congressmen during the health care vote do you really think they 'd cover such things ?
We do n't have any massive march planned ... we 're just skulking .
It 's nothing but quiet meetings with calculating organizations and political figures .
Netroots support is part of the reason Bart Stupak is already gone .
Netroots support will be key in John Bottorff 's removal of Blue Dog policy chair Baron Hill .
And if we 're going to propel Rodney Glassman into the Senate seat , Terry Goddard into the governor 's mansion , and a platoon hopeful State House candidates into the Arizona legislature we 're going to have to provide the new media close air support to back their ground game .
While I 've been writing this Spedywbabs has hunted up all of the Arizona candidates ... and Act Blue uptake for our Turn Arizona Blue effort is spotty .
If you 're an Arizona resident can you start the outreach , letting these people know that their little State House race is now a great big national issue , and that we 'll be providing assistance on the regular to the entire Arizona Democratic Party ?
The Fine Print : Progressive PST gets paid by some of the campaigns mentioned here for social media support work : Rodney Glassman in Arizona , Baron Hill primary challenger John Bottorff in Indiana 9 , Connie Saltonstall in Michigan 1

( CNN ) --
After thousands of years of civilization , finally India has Crunchwraps .
In March , a Taco Bell opened in Bangalore , the first Indian outpost of the chain .
About 2,500 people a day have been lining up to try burritos and quesadillas , helped out by employees hired to explain what , exactly , burritos and quesadillas are , according to reports .
But Indian customers are n't just ordering the Tex - Mex treats known in the U.S. Yum Foods , Taco Bell 's parent company , came up with a bunch of special menu items designed for local palates : crunchy potato tacos and extra-spicy burritos filled with paneer , the rubbery , fresh Indian cheese .
This move is what people in the trade call product localization : customizing what you 're selling to the people you 're selling it to .
It 's a crucial strategy in the global fast - food business .
American chains are bringing burgers and pizza and chimichangas to Asia , but they are also adapting to their new homes , coming up with hybrid foods that the folks back home do n't hear about .
This is nothing new , of course .
McDonald's , which has branches in more than 119 countries , has been customizing its menus for years .
Food court city :
How where you live affects what you eat
Anyone who 's seen " Pulp Fiction " knows that a McDonald 's Quarter Pounder is called a Royal in France , but it 's not just the names that are different .
French visitors to the golden arches can get Le P'tit Moutarde , a smaller - size burger with mustard sauce , and they can pair it with a banana caramel shake .
In the Netherlands , McDonald 's serves a McKroket ( a fried beef croquette on a bun ) ; in Germany , it offers shrimp with cocktail sauce .
The 280 Gr. is an Italy - only burger , designed for sophisticated palates -- you can get one with real Parmigiano - Reggiano cheese .
There 's a burger on pita bread for the Greek market ( the Greek Mac , of course ) , and a McKebab for Israel .
Naturally , you can get guacamole on your burger in Mexico ; you can also order McMolletes -- refried beans and salsa on an English muffin .
Asia is the fastest - growing market for American fast food though , and all the chains trying to find a place there are scrambling to come up with new dishes to please local tastes .
Here 's some of what Americans may be missing :
India
As the Taco Bell honchos undoubtedly know , India is a tricky market for food chains .
Hindus do n't eat beef , Muslims do n't eat pork , and a sizable percentage of the country does n't eat meat at all .
Fried chicken is a relatively safe bet , and KFC -- another Yum Foods - owned brand -- does a good business in buckets of Colonel Sanders ' original recipe .
But it also caters to vegetarians with a veg thali , a vegetable - and - rice mixed plate , and the Chana Snacker , a chickpea burger with Thousand Island dressing .
The Indian Subway menu has the same turkey and tuna sandwiches as in U.S. stores , but roast beef is nowhere to be found , and the ham is made of chicken .
And at franchises from Chandigarh to Chennai , you can order a chicken tikka sub or one made from roast lamb .
When McDonald 's set up shop in India in 1996 , it ditched beef and introduced the Maharaja Mac , originally made with lamb .
Chicken patties are used on the sandwich now , but even more popular is the vegetarian McAloo Tikki , a burger made from potatoes and peas .
To allay strict dietary concerns , the carnivorous and vegetarian cooking is done separately , by different sets of workers :
Those cooking the veggie meals wear green aprons ; people handling meat wear red .
The big fast - food success story is Domino 's Pizza , which recently opened its 300th branch in India .
It manages to please all tastes and honor all restrictions :
There 's a corn and black olive pizza for the vegetarians ( the " Gourmet " ) and keema do pyaaza topping -- ground lamb and onions -- for meat eaters .
For a true exotic taste , there 's pepperoni : " 100 percent pork pepperoni , " the online menu promises , rather scandalously .
China
The leading American chain in the Chinese market , KFC , offers plenty of dishes that cater to local tastes .
Instead of coleslaw , you can order seasonal vegetables with your chicken : bamboo shoots in spring , lotus root in summer .
It also offers a traditional breakfast menu featuring congee -- rice porridge -- served with fried crullers or sesame flatbread for dipping .
McDonald's , on the other hand , sticks mostly with classic sandwiches .
After introducing regionally specific items , such as the rice burgers it serves in other Asian countries , and trying to compete with KFC on the chicken front , it found that its Chinese customers preferred to order Western foods .
So it played up the burgers , rolling out a suggestive ad campaign with the slogan " Feel the beef . "
But not everything is exactly the same as it is in the States .
A version of the Quarter Pounder ( called the Big N' Beefy ) is served with cucumbers rather than pickles and comes with a spicier sauce .
If you do n't want fries , you can order a corn cup , a side dish that has caught on at other Asian branches .
For dessert , you can choose between pineapple or taro root pies .
Japan
For its Japanese stores , McDonald 's has found that novelty is the way to go , and the company has introduced lots of special menu items .
You can pair your Teriyaki McBurger , made from pork , with a bag of Seaweed Shaker fries ( add the seaweed powder yourself ) .
You can get a Croquette Burger or a Bacon Potato Pie .
Probably the most distinctively Japanese dish is the Ebi Filet - O , a fried shrimp patty on a bun ( " ebi " means shrimp in Japanese ) .
McDonald 's helped popularize the dish by signing up model Yuri Ebihara -- nicknamed " Ebi-chan " -- to do a series of print ads and commercials .
A few years back , Pizza Hut Japan introduced the Double Roll , an over - the - top pizza to make all other over - the - top pizzas run away and cower in fear .
One half ( the " gourmet half " ) was topped with ham , bacon , sausage , tomatoes and garlic .
The other half was covered with miniature hamburger patties , soybeans and corn .
Sadly , the Double Roll is no longer sold , but that does n't mean Pizza Hut is boring .
Your topping choices include tuna , fried squid and spicy Korean - style beef .
You also can get the " Idaho Special " with potato , corn , bacon and mayonnaise .
South Korea
Dunkin ' Donuts has made a big splash in South Korea , popularizing bagels and doughnuts as breakfast treats .
Besides the standard American glazed and filled versions , it offers red bean and glutinous rice doughnuts as well as sweet potato muffins and a sesame tofu ring .
There are savory fried croquettes filled with lentil curry or kimchi , spicy pickled cabbage .
To drink , you can get a hot 12 - grain latte , made from roasted barley , brown rice and other grains .

Obama Announces He Will Be Sending SWAT Teams To Oil Rigs
PRESIDENT OBAMA : " Earlier today , DHS Secretary Napolitano announced that this incident is of national significance and the Department of Interior has announced that they will be sending SWAT teams to the Gulf to inspect all platforms and rigs .
And I have ordered the Secretaries of Interior and Homeland Security as well as Administrator Lisa Jackson of the Environmental Protection Agency to visit the site on Friday to ensure that BP and the entire U.S. government is doing everything possible , not just to respond to this incident , but also to determine its cause . "
Wilma Mankiller , who as the first woman to be elected chief of a major American Indian tribe revitalized the Cherokee Nation ’s tribal government and improved its education , health and housing , died Tuesday at her home near Tahlequah , Okla .
She was 64 .
The cause was pancreatic cancer , said Mike Miller , a tribal spokesman .
Ms. Mankiller was the Cherokee chief from 1985 to 1995 , and during her tenure the nation ’s membership more than doubled , to 170,000 from about 68,000 .
While many Cherokees live in a 14 - county area around the tribal capital of Tahlequah , in eastern Oklahoma , its members are spread throughout the 50 states .
The current tribal membership is 290,000 , making it the second - largest tribe in the country after the Navajo .
Ms. Mankiller was admired for her tenacity , having fought off two serious diseases , lymphoma and a neuromuscular disorder called myasthenia gravis ; recovered from kidney failure that would have killed her had not an older brother given her one of his kidneys ; and survived a head - on automobile collision in 1979 that forced her to endure 17 operations and years of physical therapy .
America in the 1930s Introduction | The Great Depression | The Dust Bowl | Public Enemy # 1 | The Bonus Army
The Bonus Army Printer Friendly Version >>>
In 1924 , a grateful Congress voted to give a bonus to World War I veterans - $ 1.25 for each day served overseas , $ 1.00 for each day served in the States .
The catch was that payment would not be made until 1945 .
However , by 1932 the nation had slipped into the dark days of the Depression and the unemployed veterans wanted their money immediately .
In May of that year , some 15,000 veterans , many unemployed and destitute , descended on Washington , D.C. to demand immediate payment of their bonus .
They proclaimed themselves the Bonus Expeditionary Force but the public dubbed them the " Bonus Army . "
Raising ramshackle camps at various places around the city , they waited .
The veterans made their largest camp at Anacostia Flats across the river from the Capitol .
Approximately 10,000 veterans , women and children lived in the shelters built from materials dragged out of a junk pile nearby - old lumber , packing boxes and scrap tin covered with roofs of thatched straw .
Discipline in the camp was good , despite the fears of many city residents who spread unfounded " Red Scare " rumors .
Streets were laid out , latrines dug , and formations held daily .
Newcomers were required to register and prove they were bonafide veterans who had been honorably discharged .
Their leader , Walter Waters , stated , " We 're here for the duration and we 're not going to starve .
We 're going to keep ourselves a simon - pure veteran 's organization .
If the Bonus is paid it will relieve to a large extent the deplorable economic condition . "
June 17 was described by a local newspaper as " the tensest day in the capital since the war . "
The Senate was voting on the bill already passed by the House to immediately give the vets their bonus money .
By dusk , 10,000 marchers crowded the Capitol grounds expectantly awaiting the outcome .
Walter Waters , leader of the Bonus Expeditionary Force , appeared with bad news .
The Senate had defeated the bill by a vote of 62 to 18 .
The crowd reacted with stunned silence .
" Sing America and go back to your billets " he commanded , and they did .
A silent " Death March " began in front of the Capitol and lasted until July 17 , when Congress adjourned .
A month later , on July 28 , Attorney General Mitchell ordered the evacuation of the veterans from all government property , Entrusted with the job , the Washington police met with resistance , shots were fired and two marchers killed .
Learning of the shooting at lunch , President Hoover ordered the army to clear out the veterans .
Infantry and cavalry supported by six tanks were dispatched with Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur in command .
Major Dwight D. Eisenhower served as his liaison with Washington police and Major George Patton led the cavalry .
By 4:45 P.M. the troops were massed on Pennsylvania Ave. below the Capitol .
Thousands of Civil Service employees spilled out of work and lined the streets to watch .
The veterans , assuming the military display was in their honor , cheered .
Suddenly Patton 's troopers turned and charged .
" Shame , Shame " the spectators cried .
Soldiers with fixed bayonets followed , hurling tear gas into the crowd .
By nightfall the BEF had retreated across the Anacostia River where Hoover ordered MacArthur to stop .
Ignoring the command , the general led his infantry to the main camp .
By early morning the 10,000 inhabitants were routed and the camp in flames .
Two babies died and nearby hospitals overwhelmed with casualties .
Eisenhower later wrote , " the whole scene was pitiful .
The veterans were ragged , ill - fed , and felt themselves badly abused .
To suddenly see the whole encampment going up in flames just added to the pity . "

Toxic paint from the ship has already begun killing off coral in the area
The Australian authorities have said a Chinese bulk carrier which ran aground off Queensland has caused widespread damage to the famed Great Barrier Reef .
The cleanup is likely to be the biggest operation ever undertaken there .
The Shen Neng 1 was refloated on Monday night , in a salvage operation brought forward because of the threat of bad weather and heavy seas .
The Australian government has indicated that a prosecution will follow because the ship ran aground in a no - go zone .
Divers have now had the chance to deliver an early assessment of the harm done to the reef , and have found coral damage and paint scrapings that stretch for more than 1 km ( 0.6 miles ) .
The head of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said there was significant scarring , and that the cleanup was likely to be the biggest operation ever undertaken on the world heritage - listed reef .
The damage might not have been so extensive had the Shen Neng 1 simply run aground and stopped .

But the winds and currents meant that the 230 m ( 750 ft ) coal carrier kept on grinding against a coral shoal for more than a kilometre during the week it was stranded , turning coral into dust .
The authorities are particularly worried about toxic paint that has been scraped off the hull - because it has immediately started killing off corals in the vicinity .
The paint is designed to stop things growing on the hulls of ships , and it could be weeks before the full extent of the damage is known .
The Chinese vessel is now in safe anchorage , having been refloated in a salvage operation brought forward because of the threat of bad weather .
It is believed that the operation was completed without adding to the two tonne oil spill which seeped from the vessel immediately after it went aground .

I was nine years old in the summer of 1980 , and after Star Wars hit the scene I was hugely interested in pretty much everything Sci -Fi related .
I remember this commercial and being terribly excited by what seemed like a new entry into a rapidly growing genre , fresh with new blood from grand moff Lucas .
I begged and cajoled my father to take me to see this fantastic - looking film and eventually he caved and said we'd go on the weekend .
I remember piling into the car 's passenger seat , with three of my cousins in the back bench ready for adventure .
We went to the drive - in , those decaying remnants today were still flourishing in the late seventies and early eighties .
I remember the darkness was filled with the smells and sounds of cars , people and freshly popped corn .
My cousins were giggling in the back seat , and I was prepared for another onslaught of space - oriented fiction .
The trailers rolled , and I was settled , snacks and beverage at hand .
The film began , a darkened evening in a picturesque setting - trees full of leaves around a beatiful lake .
That was my first clue something was amiss .
In the first five minutes there was harrowing music and two people were rapidly dispatched by a demon bent upon murder .
I remember being terrified , yet unable to stop myself from peeking between splayed fingers , aghast at what I saw on the screen throughout what had to have been the longest hour and a half of my young life .
I also remember my cousins giggling like mad ; they were a little older than me by a couple of years and were more than prepared for the experience .
The fact that my father lied to me has never been forgotten , and I 've since seen the film displayed that night several times on cable television , even renting it during my reliving - my - youth days of the early nineties .
The film that night was n't The Black Hole .
It was a movie that cashed in on several sequels , spilling into several genres as it did and spawning no end of remakes and copycats .
The movie he 'd taken us to see was Friday the 13th .
I checked under my bed for a few months after that , making sure noone was underneath with an arrow waiting to dispatch me as they did poor Kevin Bacon .
I eventually saw the movie I wanted to see , and although I did n't appreciate it at first , as it was rather dark and forboding in its own right , it grew on me .
I 'll always have a soft spot for Jason Vorhees , as well .
I just wish they had n't tricked me into that drive - in .
Object lesson here , folks : do n't lie to your kids and then laugh about their insecurity because they nearly peed their pants from the horror displayed before them .
Unquestionably one of the highlights from the Boston Bruins ' Game 3 win over the Buffalo Sabres was Johnny Boychuk 's hit on Matt Ellis .
The hit electrified the TD Garden and sent Ellis to the locker room .
Hits like this one sure make the Bruins seem like a completely different team than the one that came under fire from fans for their response to the Marc Savard hit .
Are the Big Bad Bruins back ?

Though they ’ve been close allies for sometime now , Jordan and the United States have an unlikely common ground .
Groups in both nations are working to stop the sterilization of intellectually disabled women .
Around the world , families are having doctors remove the uteri of their mentally disabled daughters .
While there have been a handful of widely publicized cases in places as far - flung as the United Kingdom , Jordan , India , and the U.S. , for the most part the procedures are performed without discussion , even among disabled rights groups .
In Jordan , part of a region where the role of women is undergoing a constant evolution , the issue has recently entered the public sphere , sparking a debate that has raised concerns about both the treatment of women and mentally disabled people .
While doctors in support of the practice insist that it improves the quality of life for both the affected women and their families , opponents say it is a form of violence against women and a base violation of human rights .
“ This is a humiliation to human rights .
We do n’t have the right to decide for these girls , ” said Manal Tahtamouni , a Jordanian gynecologist who has campaigned against the practice .
At a workshop to warn families about the dangers of the procedure , Tahtamouni said that many families reported that “ their care providers advised them to do this [ surgery on their mentally handicapped daughters ] , so our main concern is that it will be a common practice in the future . ”
Throughout the world it ’s difficult to determine exactly how prevalent the procedure has become , says Curt Decker , executive director of the National Disability Rights Network ( NDRN ) in Washington , D.C. Online , however , NDRN has found thousands of parents inquiring on internet message boards about how they can perform such a procedure on their child .
Two years ago Decker ’s organization sparked an active public awareness campaign in Washington state after doctors removed a developmentally disabled girl ’s uterus and breast buds and gave her hormone therapy to limit her growth .
Decker and others at NDRN only learned about the surgery after two years after it had been performed when an endocrinologist published an article about it in a medical journal suggesting that it might be appropriate to perform on other individuals .
“ If this is happening in a country that has some fairly strong civil rights protections for people with disabilities , I do n’t think it ’s much of a leap to think that in countries where female castration and all that is happening , why would n’t we think that this is n’t something that is a fairly normal occurrence ? ” asked Decker .
“ I ’m sure this is something that does n’t make it into the light of day very often . ”
In the U.S. , there is a patchwork of legislation regarding the procedure that differs state - by - state and in most places it is not illegal .
Even in places where there might be strict regulations , Decker said that the surgery can easily be performed outside hospitals in medical suites that skirt the sort of strict oversight found in larger medical facilities .
In Jordan existing regulations technically prohibit the procedure , but leave wide loopholes that give doctors enough leeway to perform the operation .
While specialists like Tahtamouni stress that this procedure is only being performed on a handful of women each year , she said the health risks and human rights implications make it a practice that must be immediately stopped and forbidden by law .
Those who support the surgery argue that for severely disabled women , the procedure provides a way for them to improve their personal hygiene by eliminating their period .
Isam Shraideh , a Jordanian gynecologist who supports the procedure for severely disabled women , says that menstruation can often prove difficult for mentally disabled women to understand .
Additionally , in large Arab families people often struggle to provide enough care to properly help these girls through their periods .
“ You have to take into consideration our traditions in the Arab world .
The females , they might expose themselves during their period .
It would be disgusting for other members in the family , ” Shraideh said .
“ The uterus is not needed because these girls are mentally [ disabled ] , and , as we consider them , they should not marry .
So why keep the uterus ? ”
Still , many activists charge that in the Arab world the practice mainly revolves around the concern that a disabled woman could leave the house unattended , get raped and become pregnant .
This is also a concern for families in the U.S.
In Jordan , rape of disabled women is extremely rare , but the concern still looms large for many families in a country where such an incident could lead to an honor killing , said Asma Khader , secretary general of the Jordanian National Commission for Women .
Families “ thought that this is a way to prevent these types of sexual crimes , ” said Khader .
“ But the fact is that rape can still happen , and [ this procedure ] can only prevent pregnancy .
...
It is a practice that will make sexual crimes even easier . ”
Before Shraideh or his colleagues perform a hysterectomy on a mentally handicapped woman , he said they perform a rigorous evaluation of the patient , which includes physical and psychological tests , to ensure that her condition is severe enough to merit the surgery .
Shraideh , who usually deals with two to three such cases a year , said he has never performed the operation for a family who later regretted it .
“ It is really humane to give them a hysterectomy in order to keep their dignity in tact , ” said Shraideh .
Still , doctors like Tahtamouni who oppose to the surgery say that with time these disabled women can be taught how to deal with their periods and families should be more concerned about protecting their daughters from sexual assault , rather than just preventing pregnancy .
A recent campaign by the Higher Council for the Affairs of Persons with Disabilities sought to educate families with potential candidates for the surgery about the risks of the procedure .
While there was no one case in particular that spurred the council to action , the group ’s representative , Lara Yassen , said the group grew concerned when it heard about several families deciding to carry out the procedure .
Many of the families who attended the workshop did not realize a hysterectomy is an invasive surgery that can lead to major complications .
“ We told families that it ’s not permitted in any way by Shariah law [ Islamic law ] or from a human rights perspective , ” said Yassen , who added that the practice is also widely condemned by Christian scholars .
With Brisbane 's new CityCycle bike hire scheme due to kick off later this year , the issue of how helmets will factor in remains a sticking point .
The new program will hire out 1,500 bicycles in the city and surrounding areas , from 113 hire stations .
Similar schemes have been operating successfully in European cities like Paris , Amsterdam and Brussels - even cities in Iran and India are on the bandwagon .
However none of these countries have strict helmet laws , which may prove to be a bone of contention for Brisbane .
In a brief statement to ABC News Online , Brisbane City Council said there was no chance of loosening the state 's tough helmet laws .
" Users of the cycle hire scheme will be required to wear helmets from day one .
They will have four options : bring their own , purchase one as part of their subscription package , hire one from outlets around the city , purchase one from outlets around the city , " the statement said .
" [ But ] the details of these last two , such as price and locations are still being worked out .
The scheme opens in late 2010 . "
Peter French , co-convenor of CBD BUG , an advocacy group which focuses on bike use issues within the CBD , says it 's doubtful many people would be willing to hire a helmet that 's been on a stranger 's sweaty head .
" Unless they were going to start getting people to wear hair nets , I really do n't see that working , " he said .
ABC News Online asked the Twittersphere if they would pay twice - to hire a bike then a helmet - and these were their responses .
@ Dubito :
Only if prices seemed reasonable , but I support the idea of less cost for supply - own - helmet .
@dessessopsid : no , given the law requires you to wear a helmet , I think it should be included in the hire price of the bicycle .
@lozfea : I used something like this in Montreal , Canada - was great .
But surely bike cost would include helmet as is the law ??
@KeeptheBshonest : Yep , hire bike system in europe is fantastic , and led to laws protecting cyclists etc .......
Helmet vending machines
Mr French says the program is a fantastic idea and he 's excited about it starting , but he is n't aware of a workable idea for helmets being put on the table yet .
" As far as we know there have been a number of proposals .
Vending machines , folding helmets and a few other unusual angles , " he said .
" But as we understand , none of those things have come to fruition .
We 're hoping that some entrepreneurs are going to come up with a business model to start selling helmets in the city .
Otherwise we 're probably going to start seeing people riding around town without helmets .
" The main issue I see with it is when visitors want to start using it ; of course if they 've arrived on a plane they probably would n't have brought their bike helmet with them because they 've probably come from a country where they do n't wear helmets . "
Mr French says the jury 's still out on the benefits of helmets anyway and it would have been much better for Government to have invested in proper infrastructure years ago to keep cyclists away from traffic , so tough helmets laws did n't need to be enforced today .
" If you look at the countries where there 's really high levels of cycling , such as the Netherlands and Denmark , they have much smaller proportions of people being killed or injured over there , even though they do n't wear helmets , " he said .
" It is because their governments have focused on safety programs which target traffic speeds and separating cyclists from fast moving traffic . "
Andrew Demack , development officer for Bicycle Queensland , says he supports a kind of helmet vending - machine , where people can purchase one cheaply before they jump on their bike .
He does n't think that having to pay for the bike hire either annually or casually , then having to pay for helmet - then carry it around all day - will put people off the idea .
" Most people do n't want to re-use a helmet that someone else has had , so I think having access to lost - cost helmets is probably going to be the best way through for this , " he said .
" It does make it more difficult for tourists , but there are helmets that do meet Australian safety standards that are really inexpensive these days .
" But making sure these helmets are available to pick up close by to the hiring stations is going to be a bit of a challenge for operators .
" As someone who rides and carries their helmet around anyway , you find it 's not actually that much of an issue . "
' Waste of money '
Jens Uhsemann , a mechanic at the Bicycle Revolution shop in Brisbane 's West End , says the whole scheme is ridiculous and will be a massive waste of money .
" I think it 's just rubbish .
It just wo n't work .
People are n't keen to go and get a bike and a helmet and a lock - people are lazy , " he said .
" I 'm from Europe and I believe people do n't even need parking spaces - you can leave your bike anywhere and chain it up .
The problem is getting people on the bikes anyway .
If they wanted to go on them they would have their own bikes .
" When people come from overseas and rent a bike ... I 'm not sure they know about or are interested ... in helmet laws anyway .
Some people just do n't know .
We have to tell them when they come [ and hire bikes off us ] .
" Even when we sell cheap bikes to students we have to tell nearly every second person they need a helmet in this country .
" The statistics even in Europe ... Paris always tells you how well everything works , but they never tell you how many bikes they have to fix , or fish out of the river . "

BUFFALO , N.Y . --
There 's a chance the Buffalo Sabres could play the final week of the regular season without top - line forwards Thomas Vanek and Tim Connolly .
Coach Lindy Ruff said Monday he did n't know whether either will be healthy enough to play before the NHL playoffs open next week .
" They 're both doing a lot better , " Ruff said .
" I 'm optimistic we 'll get them back on the ice maybe later in the week .
Whether they 'll be able to play or not , I do n't know . "
Ruff said he'd prefer to have both play at least once before the playoffs to be conditioned to game action .
The Northeast Division - leading Sabres have four games left , and close their season at New Jersey on Sunday .
Vanek has missed four games with a lower body injury .
He skated briefly on his own before practice Monday .
Connolly has missed five games with an injured foot , and has been limited to riding a stationary bike .
Connolly , the team 's top play - making center , leads Buffalo with 65 points ( 17 goals , 48 assists ) in 73 games .
Vanek is tied for second on the team with 23 goals , and is fourth with 48 points in 69 games .
Gritty third - line forward Patrick Kaleta resumed skating on Monday , a week since having surgery to repair a thumb injury .
But he 's still not cleared for contact .
The Sabres ( 43 - 25 -10 ) are coming off two straight losses in preparing to close their home schedule against the New York Rangers on Tuesday .
The Sabres are one win or one Ottawa regulation loss from clinching the division title .
With 96 points , they 're also a point behind the Atlantic Division - leading Devils in the race to finish second in the Eastern Conference .
Another incentive for Ruff is for the Sabres to play the role of spoilers , after Buffalo had its playoff hopes dashed in the final week of each of the past two seasons .
" We want to break some teams ' hearts , ruin a few dreams on the way because we know how tough it was last year going down the stretch , " Ruff said .
" And we do n't want anybody getting any gimmes off us . "
The Rangers and the Boston Bruins -- whom the Sabres play Thursday -- are in a tight race for the East 's eighth and final playoff spot .

The president of Liberty University ’s Baptist Theological Seminary , Ergun Caner , is currently facing serious scrutiny over his biography and Muslim past .
A Christian blogger named Wade Burleson lays out the charges :
Dr. Caner has publicly stated that he came to the United States at age fifteen having been trained to be a jihadist .
In reality , Caner came to Ohio at age four and lived a comfortable , American life .
Dr. Caner has also publicly stated that his first language was Arabic and he was trained in a madrassa in Turkey .
Several International Mission Board missionaries who speak fluent Arabic have emailed me , horrified at what they have heard Dr. Caner try to pass off as his native Arabic during his audio and video sermons at SBC churches .
They confirm what others have been saying –he is speaking complete gibberish .
The myth Dr. Caner has created about himself seems now to be unraveling .
He never came to America “ via Beirut and Cairo . ”
He has never been trained as a fundamentalist Muslim .
He has never had been a jihadist .
He has never debated top Muslim scholars , in Nebraska or anywhere else .
… My friend , Mosab Hassan Yousef , has lived the life that Ergun seems to want Christians to believe Ergun has lived .
People like Yousef see right through Ergun .
( I blogged on Yousef here )
Caner ’s father was Turkish and his mother was Swedish , and by his own account he moved to the USA with his parents as a teenager at the end of the 1970s .
He says that his father was a devout Muslim who sought to raise him as a Muslim , but that after his parents divorced he converted to Christianity “ in high school ” .
Caner is now a prominent conservative evangelical polemicist against Islam ; he is the author Unveiling Islam and other books on the subject .
However , not everyone is convinced .
A Muslim named Mohammad Khan ( mokhan247 on Youtube ) has delved into the subject in some depth , with a website here , but scepticism is also being expressed by some Christians , particularly from the Reformed tradition .
An addition to Burleson , these include James White of Alpha & Omega Ministries , a blogger named Debbie Kaufman , and a site called Witnesses Unto Me. Further research has been provided by a blogger named Mirele , who does not state any religious affiliation but is sympathetic to Islam .
Mirele summarises the evidence , with links :
… The problem with his statements ( and you have to read the posts to get the full impact ) is that Ergun Caner has been in the USA since prior to his fourth birthday .
His parents bought a house together in 1974 , but had separated by 1975 .
As part of a 1978 separation agreement , custody of Ergun and his brothers went to his mother , but his father got the boys every other weekend , on three Muslim holidays and five weeks per year .
( I have reviewed this document and I do not see an order by the judge saying that the boys were to be raised Muslim . )
However , Ergun ’s mother did n’t like any of this and filed an appeal .
The appellate decision found that the district court did n’t ( and could n’t ) dictate the children ’s religion , but that each parent could teach the children when they had custody or visitation .
Caner ’s response has not been impressive : apparently he posted a statement in February apologising for any “ unintentional misleading statements ” , but then removed it , and he recently sent out a message via Dave Eppling , “ Chief of Staff to the President , Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary ” .
This message claims that Khan is running a “ pay YouTube site ” , obviously meant to insinuate that he is motivated by a wish to make money – but it ’s not true ;
Khan ’s videos , like all material on YouTube , is free - to - view .
He then plays the victim , in passive - aggressive style :
I never thought I would see the day when alleged “ Christians ” join with Muslims to attack converts .
In fact , it has gotten so bad that they procured or hired someone to go to the courthouse in Columbus , Ohio , to get copies of our parents ’ separation , divorce and appeal papers .
The purpose of this was to “ expose ” us as frauds .
They wanted to prove that we were not former Muslims .
They have actually posted these documents online .
What they ended up doing was proving that we were , in fact , Muslims .
The court papers showed that ( 1 ) we are immigrants , ( 2 ) we were Muslims , ( 3 ) our father was so devout that he demanded that the court order that we continue to be raised Muslim , ( 4 ) they he wanted visitation on the Eids ( Muslim holy days ] , ( 5 ) that we were Turkish citizens and would become American citizens from our Turkish papers , and ( 6 ) that our father still had property , money and furniture back in Turkey .
… Regardless of how this ended up backfiring on them , you can imagine the horror of having your entire life up online , for the joy and derision of others , especially those who should know better .
Caner has made a career out of his life story , yet for other people to investigate public documents about his past is some sort of intrusion , apparently .
White ’s response is scathing :
… Let me say it again : I do not believe Ergun Caner is fake ex-Muslim .
I believe he is a fake ex-DEVOUT Muslim .
There is a difference .
There is no question that Ergun Caner ’s father was a Muslim .
That he was , as Caner claims , a Muslim “ leader ” is another issue .
Clearly Caner considered himself a Muslim .
But Caner ’s parents divorced when he was quite young , and the real problem is Caner ’s attempt to re-form his past so that his devotion to Islam could be exaggerated for the purpose of creating a more stirring testimonial .
… no one is seeking to “ attack converts . ”
This is absurd on a level that is hard to imagine …
Ergun Caner is not being “ attacked ” by anyone : he is being challenged to tell the truth in the face of a mountain of documentation indicating he has been untruthful while standing behind the pulpit of many a church .
To call such a necessary challenge an “ attack ” is to do nothing more than mock honesty and integrity itself while appealing to the emotions .
What is more , in this situation , may I suggest it is Ergun Caner who has “ attacked ” converts ?
How so ?
By mythologizing his own conversion experience , he has cast doubt upon all those true conversions to Christ from Islam .
Caner has also edited his on - line bio ; Burleson comments :
The new biography of Dr. Caner is set to go up this week .
The old biography , filled with deceptive statements , remains down at Caner ’s website .
The new one has been directly approved by Liberty Seminary ’s Chancellor , Dr. Jerry Falwell , Jr… I ’m not sure it has even crossed the Chancellor ’s mind how odd it is to have to rewrite , reread , and repost a biography of his President .
One of Caner ’s associates is the prominent minister and Christian author John F. Ankerberg .
Ankerberg has not commented on the controversy , although he has found time to complain to YouTube about some of Khan ’s videos , which he claims are “ copyright infringement ” of his TV show .

A foal thought to be the tiniest horse in the world was born at the appropriately named Tiz A Miniature horse farm in Barnstead , New Hampshire , USA last Friday .
Weighing in at just 6 lb ( 2.7kg ) and standing just 14 - inches ( 35 cm ) tall , the tiny creature , which has been named Einstein , is set to take the crown from Thumbelina , who at 17.5 - inches currently hold the title of worlds ’ smallest mare .
Einstein ’s breeders at the farm are so confident that he is small enough to enter the Guinness Book of World Records that they have uploaded a film of the newborn ’s first trip into the paddock and wobbly first steps onto YouTube , with the caption ‘ The Smallest Horse in the World . ’

As the recent security scandal involving the CEREUS Network begins to fade into the e-past , at least one prominent voice in the pokerverse is n’t ready to let it go : Daniel Negreanu .
Negreanu had harsh words for CEREUS and the past operators of the poker rooms that make up the CEREUS Network , Ultimate Bet and Absolute Poker , in a recent blog post .
The PokerStars pro took exception not only with the fact that the latest flaw existed , but also with the handling of the fix , viewed by many in the community as a fumble at best .
Excerpt :
This company is just a bad apple in our poker community and I could n’t imagine supporting them in any way .
I said this 10 years ago , and since then I ’ve only been proven correct by the huge scandal , and then again recently when they were aware of the security hole , but chose to keep the site up and running .
If you know your software can be easily hacked , is n’t that the precise moment where you shut down for maintenance and fix the issue ?
Negreanu is referring to a recent security flaw at CEREUS that potentially allowed hackers to gain control of a user ’s account and view their hole cards in real time .
From the time the exploit was originally published on PokerTableRatings , it took CEREUS over one week to deploy a permanent fix for the issue .
An initial attempt by CEREUS to correct the problem was quickly found to be insufficient , resulting in a delay of several days before a proper fix was released .
CEREUS continued to operate during this lag , with a known and published security flaw still existent on the network .
This choice has prompted criticism from several corners in the poker community , with many wondering why , in the face of this security deficiency , CEREUS did n’t choose to shutter the network until the problem was addressed adequately .
Negreanu is among those wondering :
I ’ve spoken to , and only heard great things about their new guy Paul Leggatt , but this is a pretty big deal in my book .
Dude , if you knew about this security issue , why , why , oh why did n’t you shut the site down immediately to fix it ?
I thought about that overnight , and could n’t think of even one good reason not to shut it down until the site was secured .
Maybe I ’m missing something , but I ca n’t imagine what that would be .
It ’s important to note that there are ( to date ) no reported cases of the exploit being used to actually gain access to a player ’s account ( all of the PTR hacking was done on test accounts they created ) .
Also , PTR now confirms that the original security flaw is no longer an issue following the final fix by the CEREUS Network .
That said , the fact that another massive security flaw was uncovered at UB / Absolute came as a total shock to many , as both rooms were still recovering from similar scandals that cost players tens of millions of dollars lost to cheaters who exploited security vulnerabilities at the rooms .
Negreanu had some harsh words for UB / AP pros as well .
While not calling out anyone by name , Negreanu echoed the questions circulating in the minds of thousands of other players regarding how people who care about their reputation can feel comfortable being officially linked to UB or AP : “ I just have n’t heard any of them explain to me how they justify that endorsement in light of what happened in the past , and then what ’s just happened recently ?
Are you really OK with how this recent issue was handled ? ”
The one UB pro to really discuss the issue publicly , Joe Sebok , did so in a blog post where he sounded as if he was tiring of his association with UB :
Whether it is hand - histories , ownership issues , or security ones like the one above , often I am not in a position to directly answer them as I do not work in Costa Rica at the home offices and actually help run the company .
I advise , and again , try to serve as a conduit for information to flow through when issues are brought up , but in truth I do n’t often have the answers .
I was n’t with UB when many of the negative issues originally happened and thus do n’t always know the answers , but I want to be able to put Paul in a position where he can answer them .
As far as we ’re aware , there ’s been no comment on the security issues by the two most recognizable faces associated with CEREUS , Phil Hellmuth and Annie Duke .
The official response by CEREUS has been limited to statements from parent company Tokwiro COO Paul Leggett .

Guess what ?
Members of the Tea Party and the Oklahoma legislature would like to join forces to start a militia army !
Reports the Associated Press : “ Tea party movement leaders say they 've discussed the idea with several supportive lawmakers and hope to get legislation next year to recognize a new volunteer force .
They say the unit would not resemble militia groups that have been raided for allegedly plotting attacks on law enforcement officers . ”
The army would protect against “ federal infringements on state sovereignty . ”
( For further reading on the noble concept of “ state sovereignty , ” see our “ Review of the Checkered History of States ’s Rights ” — or , if you want to sleep at night , just do n’t ! )
But how will this volunteer army defeat terrible infringements on states ’ rights ( e.g. , abuses of power such as providing affordable health care for the middle class ) with their guns and / or misspelled posters or whatever ?
According to the A.P. , “ even the proponents say they do n't know how an armed force would be organized nor how a state - based militia could block federal mandates . ”
A lawyer , probably , would be as effective — if not more so !— as a volunteer army in terms of overturning federal mandates .
Someone Google the Second Amendment , see if there ’s anything about “ right to bear counsel ” in there .

Grayling suggests B& Bs should be able to bar gay guests
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
A key Conservative has been recorded suggesting people who run bed and breakfasts in their homes should have the right to reject homosexual guests .
But shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said hotels should not be allowed to discriminate in that way .
Labour and the Lib Dems said the Tories would allow discrimination " to thrive " .
Mr Grayling later said he was looking at being " sensitive to the genuinely held principles of faith groups " but was not seeking a change in the law .
The secret recording has been published on the Observer newspaper 's website .
The BBC 's political correspondent Norman Smith said the stance taken by Mr Grayling , MP for Epsom and Ewell , " put him at odds with the law " .
' Right to decide ' Mr Grayling , MP for Epsom and Ewell , made his comments after a speech at the Centre for Policy Studies in London on Wednesday .
He was at the think tank to talk on the subject of " A Conservative Home Office . "
During the recording , Mr Grayling is heard responding to a question from the audience about civil liberties .
I made comments which reflected my view that we must be sensitive to the genuinely held principles of faith groups in this country
Chris Grayling
He said : " I think we need to allow people to have their own consciences .
" I personally always took the view that ... if you look at the case of ' Should a Christian hotel owner have the right to exclude a gay couple from their hotel ? '
" I took the view that if it's a question of somebody who 's doing a B &B in their own home , that individual should have the right to decide who does and who does n't come into their own home .
" If they are running a hotel on the High Street , I really do n't think that it is right in this day and age that a gay couple should walk into a hotel and be turned away because they are a gay couple , and I think that is where the dividing line comes . "
' Awkward and embarrassing ' Under the Equality Act ( Sexual Orientation ) Regulations 2007 no - one should be refused goods or services on the grounds of their sexuality .
However in March , Cambridgeshire gay couple Michael Black and John Morgan were turned away from a guest house in Berkshire because the owner said it was against her policy to accommodate same - sex couples .
Mr Black told the BBC that it " was n't just a question of feeling angry on our own behalf .
" It was the fact that [ it ] was an example of illegal discrimination .
It happened to be against a gay couple , it could be against people because they 're Muslim , or black , or for any other reason . "
I do n't think anyone , including the Tories , wants to go back to the days where there is a sign outside saying : ' No gays , no blacks , no Irish '
Ben Summerskill
Stonewall
The BBC's Norman Smith said it was " awkward and embarrassing " for the shadow home secretary , who would have to enforce equality legislation should the Conservatives win the election .
In a statement , Mr Grayling said : " Any suggestion that I am against gay rights is wholly wrong - it is a matter of record that I voted for civil partnerships .
" I also voted in favour of the legislation that prohibited bed and breakfast owners from discriminating against gay people .
" However , this is a difficult area and on Wednesday I made comments which reflected my view that we must be sensitive to the genuinely held principles of faith groups in this country .
" But the law is now clear on this issue , I am happy with it and would not wish to see it changed . "
' Private views '
Ben Summerskill , chief executive of the gay rights group Stonewall , told the BBC he was " deeply saddened " by the comments , which would give voters " pause for thought " .
He said people were not forced to open their homes as commercial premises and they should abide by the law .

" I do n't think anyone , including the Tories , wants to go back to the days where there is a sign outside saying : ' No gays , no blacks , no Irish ' , " he said .
What was more worrying , he added , was that Mr Grayling said these sorts of things in private but not in public .
Conservative leader David Cameron has apologised for Section 28 - the controversial law brought in by his party in 1988 banning local authorities from portraying homosexuality in a positive light .
And in February , openly gay Tory frontbencher Nick Herbert said there had been a " self - evident " change in his party 's attitude to gay people .
But the culture secretary Ben Bradshaw , who is openly gay , told the BBC : " Not only is this displaying the fact that the Conservatives have not really changed on this and many other issues , but here you have the shadow home secretary advocating that people break the law . "
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , said " Chris Grayling 's plan would allow discrimination to thrive " .

Richard Dawkins and Chris Hitchens think they can get the Pope arrested during his next trip to Britain .
This might sound like a long shot , except for this :
Dawkins and Hitchens believe the Pope would be unable to claim diplomatic immunity from arrest because , although his tour is categorised as a state visit , he is not the head of a state recognised by the United Nations .
Also , a recent effort to raise an arrest warrant for Tzipi Livni , based on the Gaza occupation , was successful , and Livini canceled a trip to Britain .
If someone started a fund to do this in the US , I ’d contribute .
This past week , the University of Winnipeg stepped closer to this goal of " creating an active transportation hub on campus " , with the City of Winnipeg saying it will spend $ 1.2 million to renovate the former bus depot space at Portage and Balmoral ( the Rice Building , 491 Portage ) .
Plus , Transit will " chip in $ 50,000 a year [ paid 50/50 between the City and Province ] to share the cost of security , lighting , cleaning and maintenance inside the terminal [ with the U of W ] , " who lease the building from 4306946 Manitoba Ltd , a company that the U of W's Community Renewal Corp. has a 25 % stake in .
In August , 2009 , the U of W claimed that " [ r] enovation and operating costs for the ANX will be covered by rental leases and savings from lease reductions as part of the University 's efforts to consolidate its facilities and programs on the main campus . "
Not only will the building " pay for itself , " the University believed , but their " operating budget will benefit from these renovations both through increased revenues from retail services and a return on rents owing to the fact The University of Winnipeg Community Renewal Corporation ( UWCRC ) owns 25 % of the 491 Portage Avenue complex .
" And if it does n't pay , if the debt / service coverage ratio falls below 1.0/1.0 ( in other words , if the property owner starts to lose money on this agreement ) , the university is required to either start paying market - rate rent on the property or find another tenant .
( Link , p.26
Or , possibly , find someone dumb enough to pay the cost of renovating a big chunk of the building , and chip in with the property 's operating costs .
And what does the City and Transit get from this ?
Eight transit routes will converge on the Balmoral terminal , plus whatever ' bus rapid transit ' routes are developed in the futre .
What are these eight routes ?
According to Winnipeg Transit , they are :- Route 3 Downtown Spirit .
Daytime hours , Monday to Saturday - Route 42 Plessis Express .
Weekday P.M. rush hour only - Route 46 Transcona Express .
Weekday P.M. rush hour only - Route 47 Transcona Local .
Runs full daily schedule ( approx .
5:30 am- 1:30 am ) Monday - Sunday - Route 48 McMeans Express .
Weekday P.M. rush hour only - Route 49 Dugald Express .
Weekday A.M. rush hour only
The remaining two , which I believe are the 40 and 41 express routes , are not running on Winnipeg Transit 's Spring 2010 Schedule .
Even if a few ' rapid transit ' routes terminated here sometime in the next century , they are still removed by at least a block from the major transit routes that U of W students use : 11 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 24 , etc .
What is the point of getting dropped off in front of an indoor station if you 're just headed back outside to cross Portage and Memorial and go around The Bay to catch a transfer ?
A hub is only as good as its spokes , and one major city route , a downtown shuttle , and a handful of barely - there express routes to Transcona do n't make for much of one .
For transit users , this poorly - located terminal is only one minor ( but costly ) improvement , and looks more like patronage to ' the godfather ' than it does good transit planning .

FASHION , they say , is an index of change , registering shifts in confidence and mood too subtle to glean from the rise and the fall of the Dow .
No need to tell Natasha Jen , who tarried on Mott Street one weekend earlier this month taking in the parade of women showing off their latest buys : effusively colorful skirts and frocks in jungly hues and covered in pansies , cheetah markings and tribal geometrics that evoked Ivory Coast .
Watching the panoply unfold , Ms. Jen , a graphic designer , felt a rush .
“ There ’s a kind of vibrancy in all of this , ” she said .
“ I see it as a signal of recovery . ”
Wishful thinking ?
Maybe so .
Yet Ms. Jen has a point .
The profusion of hothouse colors and patterns popping up on New York streets this month suggests a new buoyancy , as women shake off the constraints of a lingering recession and stock up on fashions more lively and vivid than they ’ve seen in years .
Seen here with C - 3PO and Dane Cook , college grad Manja Pieters ( BTDT -- had to get a salve from the witchdoctor ) wore a full Stormtrooper costume to her graduation ceremony .
Why ?
Hell I do n't know , why did I wear a tophat and monocle to mine ?
Oh right , because I 'm classy was dating Mr. Peanut and we always dressed alike .
Manja Pieters , 36 , is one of 1360 Canterbury University students to graduate this week , and he paraded through central Christchurch in the costume yesterday before receiving her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree , majoring in film .
" I have graduated a few times before and I thought , ` This is my final time - I 'm going to go out with a bang ' , " she said .
Pieters said she grew up with movies such as Star Wars and directors like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg , who inspired her to study film .
Pieters , who had to remove her helmet to be capped , said some people appeared intimidated by the outfit , but " I 'm short so I 'm not that imposing " .
" I 'm short so I 'm not that imposing " my ass !
You ever seen those Lollypop Guilders from The Wizard of Oz ?
Now imagine a bunch of them together wearing Stormtrooper armor .
Frightening enough to even scare the hair off Chewbacca 's balls .
Stormtrooper graduate ' goes out with bang ' [ stuff ]
Thanks to Simon and jimmy , who wore wings to graduation and are now both fully - licensed toothfairies .
Even gridlocked Los Angeles is a better place for commuters than Toronto and its neighbouring municipalities , says a study conducted for the Toronto Board of Trade .
It takes people in Greater Toronto an average of 80 minutes to commute to work , round trip , the study found .
That ’s 24 minutes slower than Los Angeles , and the worst among 19 cities including New York , London , Chicago and Berlin .
While acknowledging that the measurements for some U.S. cities may be underestimated , the study called Toronto ’s performance “ embarrassing . ”
The figures blend commute times for both drivers and public transit users .
“ Toronto ’s commuting problems give rise to serious congestion issues , ” the report notes .
At 76 minutes , Montreal was n’t much better than Toronto .
New York measured an average commute of 68 minutes , while first - place Barcelona reported an average commuting time of just 48 minutes .
Despite Toronto ’s transportation problems , the Ontario government delayed $ 4 billion in expansion projects for transit lines in Toronto and York Region as part of last week ’s provincial budget .
Carol Wilding , chief executive of the Board of Trade , noted that a plan exists to deal with transportation issues in Greater Toronto , but it exists mostly on paper .
“ It was 80 per cent unfunded , and now with Thursday ’s provincial budget , it ’s 90 per cent unfunded , ” said Wilding on Monday as she released the report .
The study which calls itself a “ scorecard on prosperity , ” noted that on most measures Toronto scores well as an attractive place to live , and has succeeded in attracting residents .
But it scores poorly on attracting investment , leading to questions about how easy it will be to sustain the Toronto region economy .
It found that as the recession took hold of the economy , the City of Toronto suffered less than its suburban neighbours , although all lost ground .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Steve Jobs issued a rare public critique Thursday of products developed by Adobe Systems Inc. , escalating the hostility between the two Silicon Valley icons .
In a nearly 1,700 - word statement posted on Apple's AAPL , +1.50 % main Web site and titled " Thoughts on Flash , " Jobs -- known for dashing off terse emails -- starts off by noting that he has a long history with Adobe 's ADBE , +0.22 % founders , going back to " when they were in their proverbial garage . "
Apple was " their first big customer , " and it owned a large stake in Adobe for many years , he writes .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs penned a 1,700 word essay on why he wo n't allow Adobe 's Flash technology to be used on the iPad and other Apple products .
AllThingsD
But the Apple CEO then goes on to write that " since that golden era , the companies have grown apart . "
Adobe 's
Flash technology , which Apple has not blessed for use on its popular iPhone and iPad devices , represents " a closed system , " Jobs writes , whereas Apple believes standards used to develop Web sites should be open .
Jobs ' personal dislike for Adobe 's Flash technology has been widely reported , though his feelings have largely been expressed in private .
Read the full text of Steve Jobs ' statement on Adobe and Flash here .
Last week , Adobe announced that , following years of effort , it would cease funding projects aimed at getting Flash onto the iPhone .
See related story about Adobe 's Flash decision for the iPhone .
At that time , Adobe complained that it was Apple that was building a closed system , by trying to " tie developers to its own platform . "
In contrast , Flash is developed to be used on " multiple platforms and devices . "
In the future , Adobe said , it would focus on developing Flash for devices running on Google Inc.'s GOOG , +0.01 % open - source Android operating system .
An Adobe spokeswoman said in a statement that , " Apple 's moves to block Flash and other technologies are designed to protect a business model that locks developers and consumers into a single , proprietary stack .
Recent changes to Apple 's licensing agreement are proof of that .
Any attempt to position this solely as a technology issue is a smokescreen . "
In a taped interview with Wall Street Journal Deputy Managing Editor Alan Murray , Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen defended Flash , saying it benefits designers and publishers .
" It does n't benefit Apple , and that 's why you see this reaction " from Jobs , Narayen said .
In his posting , Jobs acknowledges that many Apple products are proprietary , such as the iPhone and iPad operating systems .
But he seeks in the letter to distinguish between the need for such technologies to be open , and the need for open standards required to build Internet services and sites .
Adobe 's Flash is used across much of the Internet to develop animation and video services .
But Jobs writes that services that often rely on Flash , such as YouTube , are also available on Apple devices in " a more modern format . "
In addition , Jobs said that there are stability concerns with Flash .
" Flash is the number one reason Macs crash , " Jobs writes , referring to Apple 's personal computers .
" We have been working with Adobe to fix these problems , " Jobs writes , though he adds that Adobe 's past announcements that Flash would be coming to " a smartphone " were premature , adding , " We think it will eventually ship , but we 're glad we did n't hold our breath .
Who knows how it will perform ? "
Adobe developed its most recent iteration of Flash to be able to write applications initially for one device , but then have it reproduced for another .
But Jobs writes that such an approach is flawed , because its results are often substandard .
" Flash is a successful business for Adobe , and we can understand why they want to push it beyond PCs , " Jobs writes .
" But the mobile era is about low power devices , touch interfaces and open Web standards . "
Broken Bells , the duo of Danger Mouse and Shins frontman James Mercer , have scored quite a coup for their forthcoming video for " The Ghost Inside " .
Entertainment Weekly reports that actress Christina Hendricks , who plays Joan Holloway on " Mad Men " and is almost certainly the hottest woman on the entire face of the planet , appears in the clip as a " beautiful android . "
You lost , every other band .
Talking to EW , Mercer says that the duo immediately wanted Hendricks , but they did n't think they 'd get her : " We assumed we would ask and that 'd be it .
She 's got to be so busy , and who the hell are we ?
But she said yes !
Turns out she 's a fan of our record . "
We do n't know yet when the video will be out .
On a related note , the video seems to be space - themed , and this mysterious website has been floating around that seems to have something to do with Broken Bells , so we imagine the two have something to do with each other .

For many Californians , it is science fiction ’s ultimate doomsday scenario :
A large earthquake in another part of the world ignites a long seismic fuse that races around the globe , unleashing a cataclysmic quake here .
On the heels of Tuesday ’s devastating earthquake in China — a magnitude 6.9 event , according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park — it seemed like a plausible idea .
“ It ’s certainly a question we wrestle with , ” said USGS seismologist Tom Parsons .
“ How linked are these earthquakes ? ”
As it turns out , not very .
April shakers in Sumatra ( 7.7 ) and Mexico ( 7.2 ) , an 8.8 monster off the coast of Chile in February , and January ’s ruinous 7.0 Haiti quake left so many people nervously wondering whether the apocalypse was imminent that the USGS issued a news release Wednesday under the headline , “ Is Recent Earthquake Activity Unusual ?
Scientists Say No. ”
The USGS found that since 1900 , the annual average for magnitude 7.0 or higher earthquakes is 16 , putting 2010 on course for a fairly normal year , with six so far .
“ A lot of the quakes this year have unfortunately happened in populated areas , and as a result casualties and damage are in the news , ” Parsons said .
“ The variability year to year is very large , but the rate this year is not higher than normal . ”
Parsons refused to call the possibility of a seismic China Syndrome sci- fi hogwash , however .
Could what happened near the mountains of Tibet affect us here ?
“ That ’s an open question , ” he said .
“ When a big earthquake happens , we see seismicity rates rising , temporarily but quite significantly , as the surface waves from these big quakes travel around the planet . ”
But he cited an unpublished study that indicates big earthquakes do n’t trigger other big earthquakes .
“ The Sumatra quake lit up parts of the globe everywhere , ” he said .
“ So in that sense , it ’s valid to ask , Is there some kind of a physical link ? ”
Parsons examined mega -quakes for the past 30 years , and could find no evidence that one led to another .
“ That does n’t say it could n’t happen , ” he said , “ but over the last few decades it does n’t appear it has . ”
Popular culture has contributed to the apocalyptic quake talk .
The 2004 TV movie “ 10.5 ” and “ Crack in the World ” from 1965 suggested the Really , Really Big One could turn the planet inside out .
“ The idea comes up from time to time , but there does n’t appear to be the fault necessary to produce such an event , ” Parsons said .
“ In terms of a cataclysmic event , you really need a fault that ’s already in existence to break .
The energy required to fracture intact rock is so great , the forces just are n’t there to start a new fault all at once and cause a giant earthquake . ”

The ID card plan is one of several steps advocates of an immigration overhaul are taking to address concerns that have defeated similar bills in the past .
The uphill effort to pass a bill is being led by Sens. Chuck Schumer ( D. , N.Y. ) and Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) , who plan to meet with President Barack Obama as soon as this week to update him on their work .
… The biggest objections to the biometric cards may come from privacy advocates , who fear they would become de facto national ID cards that enable the government to track citizens .
“ It is fundamentally a massive invasion of people ’s privacy , ” said Chris Calabrese , legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union .
“ We ’re not only talking about fingerprinting every American , treating ordinary Americans like criminals in order to work .
We ’re also talking about a card that would quickly spread from work to voting to travel to pretty much every aspect of American life that requires identification . ”
… A person familiar with the legislative planning said the biometric data would likely be either fingerprints or a scan of the veins in the top of the hand .
It would be required of all workers , including teenagers , but would be phased in , with current workers needing to obtain the card only when they next changed jobs , the person said .
The card requirement also would be phased in among employers , beginning with industries that typically rely on illegal - immigrant labor .

Rev. Jesse Jackson calls law ‘ terrorism for the innocent ’; NY Times reporter : ‘ I ’m not going back ’ to ‘ police state ’ ; Illegal immigration critic Scarborough calls law un - American
Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano said Tuesday that US justice officials have “ deep concerns ” about a controversial new Arizona law that critics fear may encourage racial profiling and other acts of discrimination .
ADVERTISEMENT
The law , signed Friday by Arizona ’s Republican Governor Jan Brewer , allows police to question and detain anyone in the southwestern border state they believe may be an illegal immigrant , even if they are not suspected of committing another crime .
Napolitano said at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Justice Department is reviewing “ whether the law meets constitutional safeguards . ”
The Barack Obama administration has “ deep concerns with the law from the law enforcement perspective , ” she said , adding that officials worry that the law “ will detract from resources that we need to focus on those on the country illegally — who are those who have committed the most serious crimes . ”
The bill , enacted in Napolitano ’s home state of Arizona , would require anyone in the state suspected of being an illegal immigrant to show a document proving their legal status , like a “ green card ” permanent residency document or a passport .
Opponents of the law say that if police demand papers from someone they suspect of being an illegal immigrant , and they turn out to be a US citizen , their constitutional rights will have been infringed .
ADVERTISEMENT
The legislation — one of the strongest measures ever against illegal immigration in the United States — has ignited fury from rights groups and a fierce legal and political row , just as Democrats consider launching a comprehensive immigration reform bid months ahead of critical mid-term US elections .
An ACLU press release sent to RAW STORY states ,
The Arizona law is the most extreme anti-immigrant law in the country , requiring law enforcement to question individuals about their immigration status during everyday police encounters , creating new immigration crimes and penalties inconsistent with those in federal law , asserting sweeping authority to detain and transport persons suspected of violating civil immigration laws and prohibiting speech and other expressive activity by persons seeking work .
Secretary Napolitano stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) has deep concerns with the lawÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s effects and that such broad immigration enforcement may detract and siphon resources away from ICEÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s priority of focusing on the most serious criminals .
The American Civil Liberties Union fiercely opposes the Arizona law , believing it will result in racial and ethnic profiling and alienate immigrant communities from cooperating with the police .
ADVERTISEMENT
Omar Jadwat , a staff attorney with the ACLU ImmigrantsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ Rights Project , added , “ If thereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ever a time for the Obama administration to step in and take a stand for fairness and equality , the time is now .
We call on the Obama administration to take every step within its power to make sure this abhorrent , discriminatory law never takes effect . ”
As Huffington Post reports , “ New York Times reporter Linda Greenhouse , who won the Pulitzer Prize for her Supreme Court coverage , has written a seething op - ed condemning the immigration law recently signed in Arizona . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Greenhouse ‘ is n’t known for writing provocative opinion pieces , ’ notes Washington Monthly ’s Steve Benen , ” the Huffington Post article adds .
“ She ’s clearly outraged now , however . ”
Greenhouse wrote ,
IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m glad IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve already seen the Grand Canyon .
Because IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m not going back to Arizona as long as it remains a police state , which is what the appalling anti-immigrant bill that Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law last week has turned it into .
What would ArizonaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s revered libertarian icon , Barry Goldwater , say about a law that requires the police to demand proof of legal residency from any person with whom they have made Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ any lawful contactÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and about whom they have Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ reasonable suspicionÃ¢â‚
¬Â that Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â WasnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t the system of internal passports one of the most distasteful features of life in the Soviet Union and apartheid - era South Africa ?
And in case the phrase Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ lawful contactÃ¢â‚
¬
Â makes it appear as if the police are authorized to act only if they observe an undocumented - looking person actually committing a crime , another section strips the statute of even that fig leaf of reassurance .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ A person is guilty of trespassing , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  the law provides , by being Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ present on any public or private land in this stateÃ¢â‚
¬Â while lacking authorization to be in the United States Ã¢â‚¬â€ a new crime of breathing while undocumented .
The intent , according to the State Legislature , is Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ attrition through enforcement .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Reverend Jesse Jackson talked with MSNBC ’s Contessa Brewer about the law , blasting it as “ terrorism for the innocent , ” as noted by Redding News Review .

The law says , “ You look suspicious because you are Mexican , ” Jackson told MSNBC .
He also said that President Obama ’s administration and not uncheck immigration is to blame for blacks being unable to find jobs .
“ We have a lack of urban policy , ” he said .
This video is from MSNBC ’s News Live , broadcast April 27 , 2010 .
As Washington Monthly notes , former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough , known for his tough illegal immigration stance as a host on MSNBC , called the law “ un-American . ”
Scarborough said ,
It does offend me when one out of every three citizens in the state of Arizona are Hispanics , and you have now put a target on the back of one out of three citizens , who , if they ’re walking their dog around a neighborhood , if they ’re walking their child to school , and they ’re an American citizen , or a legal , legal immigrant — to now put a target on their back , and make them think that every time they walk out of their door they may have to prove something .
I will tell you , that is un-American .
It is unacceptable and it is un-American .

[ Editor 's note :
This talk was originally delivered in slightly different form at the St. Mark 's Poetry Project on January 25 , 2010 . ]
Let ’s just begin by saying that there are more poets than ever before in the history of literature — and therefore more magazines , reading series , and tiny publishers .
There are probably 800 or so active writing programs in the United States alone .
I could have looked up the actual number , but facts do n’t actually matter .
If I say that Obama is a strong and effective president over and over again , it makes him a strong and effective president .
Be louder and say simple things over and over again , and you will triumph in any debate or forum .
Now , you might think that because there are more poets than ever , there might be more opportunities for poets than ever .
And you ’d be correct .
If your fondest wish is to become the next totally obscure minor poet on the block , well , you ’re probably already successful at that .
This literary landscape has proven itself infinitely capable of absorbing countless interchangeable artists , all doing roughly the same thing in relative anonymity : just happily plucking away until death at the grindstone , making no great cultural headway , bouncing poems off their friends and an audience of about 40 people .
A totally fine little life for an artist , to be sure .
No grand expectations from the world to sit up and listen .
One can live out one ’s days quite satisfied to create something enjoyed by a genial cult .
But that ’s not why any of us are here tonight .
We ’re here to conquer American Poetry and suck it dry of all glory and juice .
So those 800 writing programs churning out , say , 25 students apiece each year are actually factories sending more enemies to the front lines .
These soldiers , filled with ambition — and now out $ 30 K apiece — believe that they ’ve paid their dues to the kingdom .
And each one of them believes himself the true heir to all the masters .
That his face belongs on the Poetic Mount Rushmore .
And that yours does n’t .
Even within the elite enclaves of poetic communities — like this New York City Poetry Project Scene — there is a constant battle to stay afloat while pushing others beneath the bubbling surf .
Because there is so little at stake , all battles must be fought to the death .
And because there are so few spots available , the survival instinct takes over .
You ’d think that only 10 or 20 poets ever walked these corridors , to hear young poets nowadays tell the tale .
But what of the other faceless thousands who have ventured through , poems in hand , waiting for their slice of the spotlight ?
Forgotten , erased , remembered only as a rat turd upon some dusty archived sheet ?
This is not the glory we poets were imagining when we first fell in love with the idea of entering the art .
Fame has come to some who haunt this spot .
I remember Peter Jennings interviewing bereft East Village poets upon the death of Allen Ginsberg almost 15 years ago .
But now , who remembers Peter Jennings ?
Allen ’s work has languished without his fame around to bolster it .
And no poet in America holds any distinction as a cultural force .
Frank O’Hara enjoyed a brief spike in sales when a book of his was mentioned on Mad Men .
And then he returned to the abyss .
One of the best - selling poets of the last 25 years is named Jewel — she used to be a singer too .
Her publicist called me back when I booked author events in Boston .
They wanted me to organize something at the Hatch Shell alongside the Charles River , where tens of thousands go to watch the Boston Pops celebrate the Fourth of July .
Their proposal was that an established poet such as Robert Pinsky would interview Jewel onstage about her processes and inspirations , what made her tick as a poet .
This is , sadly , a true story .
They would have Jewel pre-sign copies of her poetry book and then maybe shake hands with a snaking , unimaginably long line of admirers that would no doubt shut down the city entirely .
As far as I know , this event never came to be — not because it could n’t be successful or it was preposterous , but because Jewel refused to play guitar or sing any songs during it .
She wanted to be taken seriously as a poet , I was told .
More books of her poetry have been sold since her first book ’s publication than , most likely , all other poetry books published during those years combined .
Is that serious enough for you ?
So one path to supremacy in the art might be to learn guitar and to transfer your consciousness into a pert and perky , snaggle - toothed young blond .
But barring this , what else is possible ?
We could simply write poems in solitude all our days and hope that sometime after our death , our genius is discovered and unleashed upon the world .
That is the path of the True Genius ; they come along every once in a while , like albino roses or rabbits with antlers .
But poets like us need to manufacture genius , to create something codifiable and iconic .
And then create it over and over and over again .
Cheap gimmickry works best : lowercase letters for e.e. cummings , death death death suicide poems by Sylvia Plath .
Suicide is career gold for the poet .
Sadly , the poet is n’t around to reap any benefits from it ; so use this as a last resort , and beforehand write tons of poems about how maybe you ’re thinking about it .
Poetry ’s greatest audience is depressed high schoolers , and there ’s nothing they love thinking about more than offing themselves .
Most of the True Genius poets ca n’t tie their own shoes .
They are beautiful creatures — too beautiful to exist on earth and , for example , eat soup .
What makes the Manufactured Geniuses alluring is their ability to interact with humanity — to get the things they want from people .
This is crucial to existence in an art community .
Asking for what you want is the first and only step toward getting what you want : I think you should review my book .
I think you should give me a reading .
I think you should give me the Bollingen Prize .
The more you repeat requests such as these , the more reasonable - sounding they become .
And the better the chances of someone giving you everything you want .
This talk was originally titled “ You Can Be the Next John Ashbery ” — a common dream among the experimental set .
Ashbery represents , to that cross section of artists , a pinnacle .
Jovial , often buzzed from merlot , Ashbery has been peddling his obtuse work for centuries and now seems to rule from atop the anthill .
He has never had to sacrifice sense into his art to obtain anything .
Awards , acclaim , floozies : they are all his for the taking .
But I personally decided that I found this dream too modest .
Although it seems like America is hostile to all things poetic , even though it seems that there is no room whatsoever in the American mind - set for anything complicated or difficult , plain as it may be that Americans have no time or energy to devote to real art — I know deep in my soul that the time is right for the poet to once again take his place in the firmament next to other oddities of popular culture : mimes , boxers , racehorses , mind readers , and babies trapped in wells .
When I speak of Relentless 24/7 Careerism , I would like you to think of a whirring buzz saw cutting away at chilly permafrost .
Before there was such a time as now , in which poetry is a profession with codes of behavior , cushy jobs , and an understandable path through life , the poet was alone : smoking marijuana , sleeping with friends ’ spouses , unable to see the big picture or to plan with any certainty what tomorrow might bring .
We no longer live in those dark times .
Now the path of the poet is worn and true .
She simply reads a bunch of poems , writes poems , gets some kind of writing degree , writes more poems , publishes books , teaches poetry , writes a selected and a collected poems , lives long enough to win a bunch of awards , and ideally has a rest stop along the New Jersey Turnpike named after her someday .
The student becomes the teacher to create more students , who then become teachers and lift the poet higher and higher , pressed against the firmament , no doubt someday blocking out the sun .
It is a simple dream , like Amway or any other kind of ruthless pyramid scheme , like the Mafia .
The question remains : how does one become a general in this army , as opposed to just a dues - paying pawn ?
You might think the answer is to write great poems .
The cream rises to the top , right ?
In my experience , no .
The most famous poets are not the most gifted , the most daring , or the most geniusy .
Fame and poetry mix best through steady mediocrity , the creation of a “ poetic voice ” and a concrete underpinning of institutional power .
You ought to write poems that scare or challenge no one , poems that are speckled with the kind of folksy charm people like in politicians .
Be experimental in name only .
All those French poets everyone claims to love , who wrote about cow ’s uteruses or what - have - you , died in the gutter with massive cases of chlamydia — certainly not the kind of romantic death that contemporary poets ought to strive to emulate .
No , writing great poems is not a prerequisite to being a famous poet .
It might be a hindrance .
Write one great poem and people will say , “ Why are all of that poet ’s other poems not as good as the great poem ? ”
Write two great poems and they ’ll say , “ Fluke !
Look at these other 1,000 very ordinary poems ! ”
And so on .
There ’s no pleasing these haters .
That is why you must destroy them with your steady success : that ever - spinning blade that cracks the ice .
Be cautious before all else !
Caution leads to eventual greatness .
How can you become the most important poet in America by tomorrow ?
It ’s not as hard as you think .
Poets used to have to pass out poetry - reading flyers by hand , one at a time , or publish poems one at a time in magazines , slowly building a career .
But technology has changed all that .
Now you can spam every poet in America with every new poem .
Start a fan page for yourself and your books on Facebook .
Blog about your every thought — they do n’t even have to be astute thoughts .
Most poets in America have boring office jobs in which they are screwing around on the Internet most of the time .
Just mention the names of as many contemporary poets as you can in all your blog posts .
You will catch all the self - googlers self - googling .
Self - promotion is the only kind of promotion left .
Without poetry reviewers to rely on , only you can spread the word about your product .
And if you spread it suddenly , relentlessly , brutally , then you ’ll have name recognition from here to Hawaii . . . and that ’s all you need , because there are two kinds of poets : those you ’ve heard of and those you have n’t .
Almost all of us fall into the latter category , but not you !
If only you take my advice .
Your interactions with other poets should always be filled with code phrases : “ What are you reading ? ” “ What are you working on ? ” “ When ’s your next book coming out ? ”
This allows you to follow up with what you ’ve been up to and when your next book will be coming out .
And you should always be working on something .
Whether it ’s an epic poem about the life of Bill Buckner or a poem to go along with every Beatles song ever written , the gimmick is the poem .
Without some kind of angle or catchy theme , your poem might as well be called “ Ignore Me . ” America hates poems ; the best way to be an important poet is to eschew poetry almost entirely .
If , as Charles Olson argued , a poem is an exchange of energy between the writer and the reader , then we can imagine the relationship between poets as a constant exchange of power .
Institutional power , fame , importance — these are constantly at stake in every interaction between poets .
Since very few non-poets read poetry , it makes sense that our audience is 98 percent poets .
And poets are more easily manipulated than most artists .
Our art is based on the most subjective of terms — it rises and falls based on nothing tangible .
One minute you ’re Mark Van Doren , the most important poet in the world .
The next you ’re Yvor Winters , mostly forgotten .
Does anyone in this room know who the current U.S. poet laureate is ?
[ Five hands rise , and a few call out the name Kay Ryan . ]
I ’m sure she ’s a very nice woman , but even this position of stature is no more enduring .
So how does the ambitious poet with dreams of chairing a department or being published by a huge New York press deal with the sort of intrinsic anonymity that comes with being a poet , subject to the cruel twists of fate of the tests of time ?
Thankfully , there are more poets than ever before .
Most have paid cash money to identify themselves as such .
Every interaction you have with another poet must leave you triumphant and must leave them fearing and adoring you .
It ’s not enough to merely have poets like you — like is not a strong enough emotion to propel you anywhere , except maybe to bed .
Fear is one of humanity ’s great motivators .
Fear equals Respect .
And Success .
Most poets are desperate for any kind of foothold in the genre , any sign at all that they are making progress upward toward their dreams of tweed , tenure , and cultural domination .
It is a good exercise to be constantly visualizing yourself in granite on some kind of Mount Rushmore of poetic immortals .
You , William Carlos Williams , Emily Dickinson , and Maya Angelou .
You , Charles Olson , Lorine Niedecker , and Elizabeth Bishop .
Or fancy European writers , if dominating America is n’t good enough for you .
I applaud your ambition in all its forms , I ask you to turn it out overtly upon the world .
It can not be held back , nor should it be .
Poets will see this swagger in you , this furious halo of anger and hunger , and it will overwhelm them .
They will have little choice but to supplicate .
Relentlessness does not come easily to poets .
They are generally a stoned and timid bunch , playing with their beards or sitting mousily with hands and ankles crossed .
Poets do very little 24/7 , except perhaps worry that they ’re not as widely popular as they should be .
Worry does come naturally to the poet — it must be suppressed with booze or sex ( or in my case , in which neither of those is a possibility , baseball ) .
And how does one imagine a career being built out of all of these weirds used weirdly ?
There are many paths through the art .
Having enough money to sit in a log cabin all day watching foxes make out , with berries on one ’s breath .
Having an entire university beneath one ’s command .
Ability to drag friends in for a little merlot and sloppy sex with students .
But you ’re saying to yourself , “ Behrle , you said I can become the most important poet in America overnight . ”
So let ’s get back to that overnight part .
You may have big plans for tomorrow afternoon .
Limousines may need to be rented .
Attending this speech is obviously a good start .
We must usher in an age in which we more overtly ask for and attain the things we want .
It might have been OK to once sit back in this room and dream only of the next poem and which of your friends ’ spouses you were going to sleep with or how much marijuana you had at home .
Those times are over .
Poets must get serious , must get organized , must get five stars on all their books on goodreads.com .
Anything with reviews of four stars or less will most likely be pulped and disappear forever from consciousness .
You may be expecting me to encourage you to create some kind of fake writing movement , since those were popular all last century .
But who wants to share the spotlight with anyone else ?
Fake art movements usually involve one really famous person and then a bunch of hangers - on .
Like Josie and the Pussycats .
Or Jackson Pollock and a bunch of people who drank with Jackson Pollock .
Imagine how much better off Josie would have been minus those Pussycats hogging all her fame .
Poetry movements usually include a bunch of interchangeable poets with little fame trying to create something famous ( or fame - worthy ) by pooling their efforts , like all the little lion robots that slam into each other to form Voltron .
What ends up happening is that Voltron gets a bum leg and back problems , because some of those lions are lame poets .
And then Voltron is defeated and the fake art movement turns into just a bunch of bitter old poets .
Not so glorious .
I mean , sure , your movement can get a special issue of Poetry magazine , but would n’t you rather have an entire issue of Poetry magazine dedicated to you ?
With you smiling out from the cover ?
Never take your eyes off the prize , and when you have a chance to do so , beat down all competition with the mallet made famous by Whack - a - Mole .
Jay Leno , not Conan O’Brien , is the future .
Why ?
Because Leno is more devious , sinister , and craven .
These are things to aspire to be .
Jay Leno would reach through your skin and deep into your stomach to fetch an undigested Skittle if he were hungry for one .
That ’s the spirit of Ruthless 24/7 Careerism in a strawberry shell .
Make a deal with Russia to not invade Russia and then , when Russia least expects it , invade Russia .
Your friends are really just contacts , and you have to think of them that way .
If dropping their name is n’t worth anything , you may have to ditch them .
But not before you have sucked them dry of anything that can help you get to number one .
And once you get to number one you can get new friends , like Brad Pitt and Beyoncé .
But let ’s not get ahead of ourselves .
What is the secret to changing your status as a poet tonight , minutes after you sprint home from this hall ?
And I will be available for questions after this important speech , but really , should n’t you be asking yourself tough questions ?
Questions like “ Am I doing enough to conquer American poetry ? ” Ask them to a mirror .
Or have a pig hand - puppet ask them to you .
Are you doing enough ?
Do you want it enough ?
Are you willing to kill and be killed for it ?
Tonight you can go home , pour yourself a cup of peppermint tea , and then start contacting your contacts , one by one : via smoke signals , IM , Facebook poking , whatever .
Ask them , “ What are you doing to help me become the most important poet in America ?
Have you reviewed my book , oh contact you ?
Can you get me a reading at the 92nd Street Y? Or on the International Space Station ? ”
Have your contacts written critical essays extolling your virtues as an artist or created weekend symposia dedicated to the greater understanding of your work ?
If not , should n’t they , you know , get busy on that ?
We might believe that what the media term “ buzz ” gets created organically — that everyone just starts tweeting about Jersey Shore episodes on their own , without any prompting .
But it actually takes a concerted effort across a spectrum of sources to create the phenomena we have come to know and love .
I learned this in the publicity office of a big - time Manhattan publisher , where most of my time was spent on my knees .
It takes time , effort , and Altoids to generate buzz .
And when it appears that others are talking about you , it is easier for you to talk about yourself .
“ Did you see that exposé about me in Popular Mechanics ?
I mean , really ! ”
Negative publicity works just as well .
Having the right people hate you is better than having the wrong people like you .
Controversy is rare in poetry because poets usually just drink and bottle up whatever is bothering them .
If we all just spent a year or two yelling at other poets , we might be better off and have cleaner colons .
So , tonight , get your bass electrified .
It ’s not bad to also start e-mailing complete strangers who you think have some kind of power and can help you .
Send them a poem .
Tell them that they ’re cute and that you love their poems .
That always works ; they will roll over and show you their belly .
Friend every poet you can on Facebook , goodreads.com , porn sites — everywhere .
You might also want to start Wikipedia.org sites for yourself and your books , but eventually your followers will do that for you .
Start imagining everyone else as your unpaid work - study students .
Ultimately , you are responsible for your own obscurity as an artist , and you have only yourself to blame if no one knows who you are .
So whine about teachers giving students awards or grants all you want .
Grant writing is more important than poem writing , and until you master those intricacies , you will be down and out in the city of your choosing .
No one really cares if your poems are any good .
That ’s beside the point .
What ’s more crucial in everyone else ’s eyes is how much power you have and how it can help them .
So use your power wisely .
It ’s probably better if your poems are middle - of - the - road or below average : that ’s what will attract other middle - of - the - road and below - average poets to fall in line behind you .
That ’s what will make you their demigod : because you work tirelessly on your own behalf , and people feel that they can ride your coattails to the diner for a little chow .
Because you are overtly ambitious in a way they too can admire , being ambitious but maybe more timid .
Everyone is overqualified to be a poet .
In the 20th century , all you needed to identify yourself as a poet was a quill and a funny hat that could draw the attention of your village - folk hither whilst you prattled on about the fate of dying birds or how happy your marriage is .
Some people think ’tis wise to create power couples to help them gain notoriety .
Beware !
Share the spotlight with no one !
For perhaps they will crush you .
And you will be stuck working for them : washing their cars in the rain , doing their dry - cleaning in the rain .
That would be like the Bee Gees writing a folk song .
You ’d be like hunh ?
Your contacts must work for you , not the other way around .
I hope I ’ve exposed some of the machinations behind the facade of poetry and the illusions of a poetic community .
One experiences the goodness of poetry only through one ’s own work , and feels the warm bosoms of community only if the work serves the bosoms and the bosoms ’ interests .
I did not become a poet to belong to something bigger than myself , to feel connected to other people , or to find a human substitute for the sublime .
I ’m here for the fame , the money , and ( if there are brownies ) the brownies .
The need for sex , love , friendship ; the desire to create something unique : these pale for me — and , in my experience , for all poets — against the need to make poetry work for me .
Poetry substitutes for religion for many of us .
And who wants to worship a god that is n’t actually just oneself ?
Who ’s got that kind of time ?
You ’ll know you ’re the most important poet in America , whether it happens on Tuesday , Wednesday , or sometime next week .
I ’ve got big hopes for members of this crowd to join me on Mount Rushmore alongside Jewel .
Although perhaps only Maya Angelou truly lives the dream of being the most important poet in America .
What was the name of the poet who , one year ago , read a poem at President Obama ’s inauguration ?
[ A few people name Elizabeth Alexander . ]
No one knows .
But Maya Angelou wrote Clinton ’s first inauguration poem and segued that into a dream we all dream .
If she comes to speak at a university or college , a car must pick her up at the airport — a car with no poets aboard .
I 've heard this is literally written into her contract .
Whoever is driving , he or she does so without speaking to Maya Angelou .
The contract is very specific .
She travels to the venue and away without having to read anyone ’s poems or comment on any manuscripts .
She is driven back to the airport by maybe the same deaf - mute non-poet .
And then she is gone , check in hand .
That is the dream — a poet so important and renowned that she literally is not contractually obligated to deal with poets or poetry whatsoever .
It is a sweet , sweet dream .
By tomorrow you might have 2,000 Facebook friends ; that ’s a start .
But how do you turn Facebook friends into Facebook fans ?
That ’s the key .
Let your buzz saw whir .
Attach yourself to famous people , and dismiss anything else — your ability to say no to people is more important than your ability to say yes .
I thank you for braving tonight ’s monsoon to be here in the historic East Village , a quaint reminder of how poetry used to be .
You ’d have to be a millionaire to live in this neighborhood now — poets have been priced out .
Mostly because poets were too lazy and not willing to do what it takes to become millionaires .
Do n’t fall into their despair cocoon .
I ’m ending this talk now , but I do not want your applause tonight .
Save your applause for yourself ; never waste a single clap on someone else .
Applause is really just the sound of asking for someone else ’s applause .
And when you ’re number one , you no longer need affirmation .
Your silent , chilled fear of me and what I represent will be thanks enough .
That ’s the kind of applause that never ends .
MARCH 03 , 2010
A few months ago I found a really useful Stack Overflow Question .
Here are my favorites from the answers .
Use render_to decorator instead of render_to_response
This decorator is found in the app django annoying , and is a very nice shortcut for declaring what template a view should render .
Instead of returning the response of render_to_response , you just return a python dict which will be used as the template context for the template specified as argument to the @render_to decorator .
If anything else than a dict is returned , normal view processing will occur , so this wo n't break redirects or any other cases where you might return a HttpResponse ( for example normal render_to_response code ) .
Anyway , here is an example on how to use it :
@render_to ( " list.html " ) def list_posts ( request ) : posts = BlogPost .
objects . all ( ) return { " blog_posts " : posts }
This equals to :
def list_posts ( request ) : posts = BlogPost .
objects . all ( ) return render_to_response ( ' list.html ' , { ' blog_posts ' : posts } , context_instance = RequestContext ( request ) )
Update ( 22/4 ) : Marcin Nowak notified me that the render_to decorator breaks Django Reusable App converions , so I made a fork of django - annoying where I modified the render_to decorator to support template_name and extra_context keyword arguments .
Load custom template tags in all templates
Custom template tags that you use all over your templates can be auto loaded .
Just add the following in a module that is loaded ( i.e. your urlconf if you want the template tags to be loaded for the whole project )
from django import template template .
add_to_builtins ( ' project.app.templatetags.custom_tag_module ' )
Use relative paths in settings.py
I hesitated about adding this tips , since I think it 's quite obvious , but since so many people on Stack Overflow has voted it up , I guess there are people who use ( d ) absolute paths in their settings.py .
Do n't use absolute paths in settings.py ( i.e /home/ jonatan / ... ) , instead use relative paths so that the project will work wherever it resides .
Pat Capponi is an author , with five works of non-fiction and two mysteries to her credit .
Her writing , and her life , revolve around those living in poverty , as the lead facilitator with Voices from the Street , as a steering committee member of 25 in 5 , and as an appointee to the Social Assistance Review Advisory Council .
Capponi is a psychiatric survivor , and a woman who has experienced profound poverty and exclusion .
Her perspective is from the ground up ; she believes change is possible , and certainly necessary .
Toronto has to do better by those who haunt our streets and drop-ins , Pat declares , and those living in poverty can tell us how .
She writes :
“ Not so long ago , walking was the only alternative to staying in place .
The price of a TTC ticket was too high , even just one way .
I simply did n’t have the money to spend on this luxury .
Walking hungry and cold and tired , walking on blisters or untreated corns , walking weighed down by hopelessness and despair was never much fun , watching as buses roared past , filled with people with options , with lives .
“ Now the price of a one - way fare is up to $ 3 , we ’ve removed public transit as a possibility for far too many .
Three dollars can be the difference between eating and going hungry . "
Comments on whether to cover Gardiner Expressway with a green roof on thestar.com :
“ I recently returned from a trip to New York City , where they ’ve saved an elevated train track that was to be torn down .
Instead of tearing it down , they embraced and made public space and walkways at the High Line .
Wow , it is spectacular .
Only half of the walkway is finished but the views of the surrounding streets , the Hudson River and the old factories are amazing . ”
“ Let ’s preserve it because it works .
There is no better solution short of putting it underground . ”
“ Boston ’s Big Dig may have been costly , but it is a success and 50 years from now nobody will remember how much it costs but will be thankful it is not hovering over the city like the Gardiner does to Toronto . ”
What kind of city do we want to live in — and how should we get there ?
We ’ve asked dozens of people to offer their ideas on how to make our community more livable , more successful and more just .
They are posting their suggestions on the Your City , My City blog .
We also want to hear from you .

Rahul Singh , a Toronto paramedic and founder of GlobalMedic , a disaster relief organization made of volunteer paramedics , police officers and firefighters , has made Time magazine ’s 2010 list of 100 people who have most affected the world .
He is in lofty company , sharing a spot in the Hero category with former
U.S. President Bill Clinton .
Others on the full list include President Barack Obama , Lady Gaga , Oprah , Prince and Steve Jobs .
“ Now I ’m on the list and going to a gala next week in New York to be honoured … this is not wing night at the local pub , ” Singh joked .
“ I ’m in a little over my head . ”
The list appears in Time ’s May 10 issue , available Friday .
Singh , who works full - time as a paramedic , founded GlobalMedic in 1998 .
The organization has responded to more than 50 disasters , including the recent earthquake in Haiti .
Singh is described in the Time essay by Haitian Prime Minister Jean - Max Bellerive as a “ shining example of selfless effort . ”
But Singh said the honour is n’t really about him but about the organization .
“ The only reason I ’m getting this award is because of our front - line volunteers ... the paramedics , police officers and firefighters who risk their lives and go off into the fray to give medical care and clean water to disaster victims . ”
In Time ’s introductory essay , Singh and GlobalMedic are heralded for their efforts in Haiti and are described as one of the first groups on the ground after January ’s earthquake .
GlobalMedic provided millions of litres of water to those most in need , it says .
Their efforts and their innovations , like the efforts of others on the list , “ will help change the world for years to come . ”
Bellerive summed up the contribution made by Singh and GlobalMedic in the Time essay : “ I believe I speak for all my fellow Haitians when I say how overwhelmed I am by the actions of the many who came to Haiti ’s rescue in our time of dire need .
In spite of the difficulties , their efforts are ongoing .
They came spontaneously and expected little in return .
I must say that this has lifted me up and greatly restored my faith in the fellowship of humanity .
“ A shining example of this selfless effort is Rahul Singh , a paramedic from Toronto , who founded GlobalMedic in 1998 , providing disaster relief in the immediate aftermath of catastrophes using volunteer professional emergency workers .
Singh and his group of volunteers wasted no time in arriving in Port - au - Prince and setting about providing clean drinking water and medical aid wherever it was needed .
Over an eight - week period , his team distributed 2.4 million gallons of clean water , while GlobalMedic ’s two inflatable field hospitals brought medical assistance to more than 7,000 people .
They also trained a local team of Haitians to take over the work , and right now that is just what they are doing .
“ By providing these three essentials , medical aid , water and training , they have left a lasting contribution to a grateful Haitian population . ”
Singh , meanwhile , has other plans , such as a project to build semi-permanent housing in Haiti .
Next week ’s gala at the Time Warner Center in New York City could end up being a fundraising bonanza for GlobalMedic , Singh said .
He plans to ask the others on the Top 100 list for donations to help GlobalMedic provide assistance and emergency relief .
Among others on Time ’s most influential people are :
• Han Han — The Shanghai native , 27 , became China ’s most popular blogger last year .
He zeroes in on the ills of contemporary Chinese society .
• Matt Berg –
The 32 - year - old technology director for ChildCount is leading the push to track disease in Africa with 160 - character text messages , or SMS .

The news that a Rasmussen poll has Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) running in a dead heat against President Barack Obama in a hypothetical Paul - Obama face - off for the White House has the pundits fuming .
Ben Smith , over at Politico , can hardly contain his annoyance : the poll " is a useful reminder of how totally flaky early polling is , " he rants , and " this is the Ron Paul who polled , literally , thousands of votes placing fifth in the Iowa caucuses , " and then only breaking ten percent after everyone but McCain had bailed .
This evaluation depends on a static model , however : back then , there was no bank bailout , no insurance industry takeover , no tea party movement , and Ron had no real public record to run on – the 2008 campaign , in short , was a way for the country to get to know Rep.
Paul , and the Rasmussen poll is a clear indication they liked what they saw .
Instead of invoking Paul ’s showing in the Iowa caucus , it ’s more useful to compare this poll to the results of another similar Rasmussen poll taken in 2008 , in which , as the pollster reported , " For Ron Paul , 10 % of all voters would definitely vote for him .
Fifty - nine percent ( 59 % ) say it ’s No , no matter what . "
Voter sentiment is now completely reversed : today , he ’s in a dead heat with a sitting President .
No matter how hard you try to minimize that , it ’s an astonishing fact .
What Smith has to say about the perils of early polling would normally be accepted as beyond dispute : after all remember when Fred Thompson was the man to beat for the GOP nomination ?
However , we are not living in normal times , which I define as any period when Americans abandon their traditional attitude toward politics : i.e. indifference bordering on contempt .
These days , the indifference has given way to not only awareness but also to active engagement , and the contempt for politicians has turned into a burning hatred , i.e. the very stuff and fuel of politics .
What makes it possible for Paul to ride this untamed mare is that he is n’t a politician at all : he is , in fact , the archetypal anti-politician , a professorial figure who lectures Republicans on the gravity of their fiscal and foreign policy sins , and is about as charismatic as plain oatmeal served without milk and sugar .
What ’s more , he tells the public what politicians have been loath to tell their constituents , and that is the necessity of deflation and the bearing of economic pain .
In Paul ’s view , the economic bubble generated by the Federal Reserve ‘s inflationary policies has led to the current downturn , and nothing less than gritting our teeth , cutting spending radically , and allowing the market to correct itself from government - induced distortions , is the cure .
His message , in short , is eat your spinach – not something any politician who hopes to keep his job ( or get one ) would normally say .
But then again , as I said above , these are not normal times : far from it .
The crisis of the American republic is acute , as we teeter on the brink of bankruptcy and our overseas empire shows every sign of imploding , just like the old Soviet Union – and , what ’s more , the American people know it .
As our corporatist masters feast on our tax dollars in Washington , out in the provinces voters faced with economic ruin are looking for some explanation , a conceptual framework that gets at the root of the problem and provides some solution .
Paul ’s rising popularity is due to the fact that he does indeed have a consistent philosophical approach , one that has propelled him from being a mere marginal figure – a " gadfly , " as they said – to a very real contender .
Yes , that ’s right , I said a contender for the White House : it ’s real , it ’s possible , and here ’s why .
Paul has consistently emphasized two themes that successfully capture the sentiments of the average American voter , and address the top two issues on their minds : 1 ) Fiscal sanity , and 2 ) A non-interventionist foreign policy .
As regards the first point , Ron is the foremost opponent of government spending in Congress , and has earned the sobriquet " Dr. No " many times over .
But of course practically all Republicans at least pay lip service to this ideal , although none that I know of lives up to it like Dr. Paul .
However , it ’s the second point – opposition to imperialism , and especially opposition to our crazed post - 9/11 foreign policy of perpetual war – that is the key .
As Paul explained at the CPAC conference – where he won the presidential preference poll – and on many other occasions , we ca n’t have our old republic back unless and until we rid ourselves of the empire we ’ve acquired along the way to bankruptcy .
Lecturing them on the evils of Woodrow Wilson ‘s " progressivism , " and the virtues of the Old Right ’s Robert A . Taft , he received a standing ovation ( as well as a few boos from the minuscule - but - loud David Frum Fan Club ) .
A similar reception occurred at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference , where he came within a single vote of winning the presidential poll ( losing only because the SRLC officials closed registration early , betting correctly that Paul ’s youthful supporters would n’t show up until it was time to address the convention ) .
What ’s interesting about this , from the perspective of my readers – a majority of whom are not libertarians , I dare say , and are not generally sympathetic to my " anti-government " views – is that the more Ron talks about the one subject that is supposed to rile Republicans – his foreign policy views – the more popular he gets .
It was the leitmotif of his CPAC speech , and a main theme of his SRLC speech : his opposition to what he calls " the Empire " inveigles its way into most of his public utterances : even if he ’s asked a specific question about , say , the economy , he emphasizes the impossibility of ever getting out of the economic slough we ’re in unless we throw off the burden of empire .
Paul ’s candidacy is interesting to the antiwar movement , because he has managed to mainstream ideas that were long considered too radical for the ordinary American to even bear hearing about .
To even raise the idea that the 9/11 attacks were " blowback " – in CIA parlance , an unintended consequence of US policies – was once considered a cardinal , self - marginalizing sin .
Yet Paul took this view from the beginning : that the attacks were the boomeranging after - effects of playing " king of the hill " in the Middle Eastern sandbox and succoring the Afghan " freedom fighters " ( as Ronald Reagan called them ) who later morphed into al - Qaeda .
When Paul bravely brought this up at a Republican primary debate , the thuggish Rudy Giuliani said he ’d " never heard " such an analysis , and demanded that Paul withdraw his statements .
Paul refused , and cited the 9/11 Commission ’s own words to back up his point , and yet the pundits in the peanut gallery crowed that Dr. No was finished , a " gadfly " who had been swatted by the thuggish Giuliani .
After spending millions in the GOP primaries , Giuliani was rewarded with exactly one delegate .
Paul went to the GOP convention with a small but respectable platoon of elected delegates , and in spite of being thoroughly locked out the Paulians stayed in the party and worked at the precinct level , educating activists and recruiting lots of independents and conservatives previously disdainful of the GOP .
The Paul movement was really the GOP ’s lifeline to the emerging " tea party " movement , of which it was always an essential – and certainly a founding – element .
Again , what ’s distinctive about the Paul movement within the tea party phenomenon is that they always bring their entire politics with them wherever they go : they raise the issue of the costs of war , and , as such , are currently the most active – and certainly the most successful – antiwar formation in this country .
Here we have Code Pink leader Medea Benjamin offering to join in common cause with the tea partiers , and I think they should take her up on it .
the Paulians are the logical mediators between what would , on the surface , appear to be oil and water .
As I said in a recent issue of The American Conservative , however , I do n’t think the prospects for a left - right alliance on the issue of war and peace are all that bright , to begin with because what used to be the left has essentially been absorbed into the Obama cult , and co-opted by power .
In the end , all liberals really care about is getting their " fair share " of the spoils , for themselves and their supposed constituencies .
So what if the price they have to pay is going along with mass murder in Iraq , Afghanistan , and now Pakistan ?
We all have to die sometime .
I harp on Ron Paul for all sorts of reasons , but the one of most interest to my readers is the fact that he is by far the most successful antiwar politician in recent American history .
Derided as being one of those dreaded " isolationists , " and attacked even by some alleged " libertarians " precisely for that – and because he appeals to the common man – he not only insists on raising this issue , for him it is central to his analysis of what he calls the " Welfare - Warfare State , " a phrase coined by the late Murray Rothbard .
Dr. Paul ’s diagnosis of a nation fast exhausting itself in an orgy of spending and militaristic adventurism has the stark ring of truth about it – an alarm bell ringing in the night .
When Paul and others first sounded that alarm , back in the early formative years of the libertarian movement , very few were heeding the call .
We were looked on as eccentrics , and , for example , the libertarian enthusiasm for gold was viewed as indicative of our archaic perspective , put down as an ideological curiosity and nothing more than a " crackpot " notion and a bad investment .
Today , of course , those libertarian doomsayers who said the crisis was coming have been vindicated – and all that gold they bought way back in the 1970s , and kept buying in spite of the disdain of more worldly investors , today adds up to quite a bundle .
Which is one way to get around to saying that a great deal of Paul ’s newfound political authority and credibility comes out of his having predicted the current economic downturn .
Virtually every speech made in Congress , and wherever he appeared , was dotted with references to the coming collapse if we did n’t mend our ways .
Well , we did n’t , and it ’s here .
That ’s one factor the learned Ben Smith , and the rest of the " experts " and media know - it - alls fail to take into consideration .
What fuels the tea party phenomenon and the vast anger animating the American public at the moment is the series of bailouts : the banks , the auto industry , the government workers , the Afghan government of our erstwhile ally , Hamid Karzai , not to mention the Israelis , the nation of Iceland , and maybe even the Greeks , for all we know .
As ordinary people see their homes foreclosed , their jobs evaporate , and their savings disappear , the rich get richer – not because of capitalism , or even " socialism , " as the tea partiers describe the Obama administration ’s philosophy , but due to corporatism , as Ron Paul recently explained .
Corporatism is , in essence , socialism for the rich , that is , for the benefit of certain big corporations over other big corporations , and a raft of would - be smaller competitors .
That would seem to be a precise definition of what ’s going on in the country today , one that fits nicely in with the left - right synthesis the Paul movement represents , and for which the country yearns .
Paul sweeps the independents in the Rasmussen poll , with an astonishing 47 - 28 .
Add to this Paul ’s appeal to what a recent Pew poll characterized as rising " isolationist " sentiment , and what you have is a new American majority based on the proposition that the US government should start minding its own business , both at home and abroad .
So much , by the way , for those " libertarian " academics and ivory tower Deep Thinkers who pointedly snubbed Ron , and his supporters , just as they had been doing for years , constantly denigrating his chances of making a significant difference and echoing the orchestrated smear campaign launched by neoconservatives against Paul ’s personal character and that of his supporters .
Accurately tracing the Paulian strategy to a series of articles by Murray Rothbard written in the 1990s in favor of cultivating " right - wing populism " as a vehicle for the introduction of libertarian ideas into the national discourse , these self - styled ultra-sophisticates sneered at the " rednecks " and rubes the Rothbardian strategy would attract : and they specifically turned up their noses at Ron Paul .
Instead of following the Paulian star , as most other libertarians were doing outside of Washington , D.C. , they sought to recruit their liberal friends and fellow cocktail party goers – or at least make themselves less unacceptable in the Washington social circuit , where the Obama cult reigns supreme .
In a self - conscious rebuff to libertarians outside the Imperial City , these worthies – mostly subsidized by a certain eccentric billionaire , owner of the largest family - owned corporation in the United States – launched their own " liberal - tarian " movement , as they dubbed it , which , so far , consists of either three , or perhaps four , stalwart cadre , all of them employed by the same eccentric billionaire or one of his satellites .
To even compare the respective achievements of Ron Paul and these sub-political pygmies is to diminish Ron ’s astonishing success : the latter do n’t want to create a real movement .
Their goal is to suck up to whoever ’s in power , and somehow convince them to let us have a little more liberty , and a little less warfare , all the while ensuring their own career prospects and social status in the Washington pecking order .
They said it could n’t be done : that the Paul movement would go nowhere , and that it would hurt the libertarian cause to have the Good Doctor become known as the fountainhead and symbol of the freedom movement in America .
They gave money to his worst critics – and to his son ’s opponent running in the GOP Senatorial primary in Kentucky – and used their mouthpieces to defame him .
They did everything they could to destroy him – and now he ’s running even with Obama in the polls .
These bare facts should tell libertarians everything they need to know about what kind of leadership they need , and who is going to provide it .
At this crucial juncture – the libertarian moment – these losers will pardon our dust as the rest of us move confidently into a future when we can truly raise that old libertarian slogan , " Freedom in our time , " and really believe it as if for the first time .
It becomes clear why the military has resisted the demands of Reuters and others for the release of the video ; the military had long claimed it did not know how the Reuters journalists had died and it initially withheld the fact that children were present .
Assange resisted Al Jazeera 's invitation to savage US authorities for their years of dissembling , remarking simply : '' There was certainly spinning the message and it does seem like there has been a cover - up . ''
He did n't need to say more ; by week 's end the video had been viewed 4.8 million times .
Its impact upon the reputation of US servicemen in Iraq is devastating .
Another US military video - showing last year 's bombing of Afghan villages as they siphoned fuel from a tanker hijacked by the Taliban - is also coming to WikiLeaks .
Clearly someone inside the military has begun leaking , elevating WikiLeaks and Assange overnight from mainstream journalism 's fringes to a must - see news breaker .
'' This is a whole new world of how stories get out , '' declared Sree Screenivasan , a professor of digital media at the Columbia University journalism school in New York .
Yet for all its ideals in support of openness and freedom of information , those behind WikiLeaks - especially its key founder , Assange - dwell in shadows and intrigue .
They have no headquarters , no offices and the barest of a formal structure .
Assange is particularly elusive , part obviously through necessity and part mercurial make - up .
Home - or the nearest he has to one - is said to have been eastern Africa for the past two years or so .
He has rarely spoken of his upbringing in Australia or life outside of his work , arguing that to do so may assist those who want him and WikiLeaks silenced .
But the trail of his life is across the internet , as coded and mysterious as the man he is today .
It begins - publicly at least - in October 1991 when Assange , then a teenager , was charged with 30 computer hacking offences .
Prosecutors alleged he and others hacked the systems of the Australian National University , RMIT and Telecom .
They had even managed to remotely monitor the Australian Federal Police investigation into their activities , Operation Weather .
Assange admitted 24 hacking charges and was placed on a good behaviour bond and ordered to pay $ 2100 .
The investigation in Australia began after an audacious attack on NASA 's computers in 1989 .
The word '' WANK '' appeared in big letters on NASA monitors , an acronym for Worms Against Nuclear Killers .
Underneath was an Australian connection - lines from a Midnight Oil song .
Whoever did it was never identified .
In 1997 an astonishing book was published in Melbourne .
It sold a respectable 10,000 hard copies but , when it was made available free on the internet it was downloaded 400,000 times within two years .
Underground told the riveting inside story of the city 's computer hackers and Assange was prominently billed in it as a researcher for the book 's author , Dr Suelette Dreyfus , now an academic researcher .
It opened with a detailed account of the NASA attack .
Dreyfus wrote glowingly of Assange 's efforts : '' Julian had worked thousands of hours doing painstaking research ; discovering and cultivating sources , digging with great resourcefulness into obscure data bases and legal papers - not to mention providing valuable editorial advice . ''
The book did not name the Melbourne hackers but used their online identities and told their story .
The records of Assange 's court case and his biographical details on WikiLeaks match the story of Mendax - one of the hacker 's online identities in Underground .
Mendax is described as a super intelligent child who never knew his father and was dragged from state to state by his mother who pursued a series of turbulent relationships .
In 1988 , Mendax was 16 years old and living in Emerald in central Queensland - the age Assange was at that time .
Dreyfus wrote : '' For a clever 16 - year - old boy the place was dead boring .
Mendax lived there with his mother ; Emerald was merely a stopping point , one of dozens , as his mother shuttled her child around the continent trying to escape from a psychopathic former de facto . ''
Dreyfus continued : '' Sometimes Mendax went to school .
Often he did n't .
The school system did n't hold much interest for him .
It did n't feed his mind …
The computer system was a far more interesting place to muck around in . ''
She also wrote that Mendax had a deep voice for his age .
Assange has a distinctively deep voice .
Mendax fathered a son in his teens .
Assange has said he has a son at university .
Mendax suffered a breakdown after he was arrested by the police , and after a period in hospital he lived rough in the Dandenong Ranges outside Melbourne .
When he finally appeared in court on the hacking charges , Assange was living in the Dandenongs .
Was this the story of Assange 's life ?
Was he Mendax ?
Dreyfus will not say , citing the promise she made to the young hackers who had helped her with her book , that she would not disclose their identities .
She is protective of and still obviously close to Assange .
She told the Herald this week : '' He is not politically motivated .
He is more concerned with truth and the quest for it .
He is certainly not party political .
I think he sees that there are good people on both sides of politics and definitely bad people .
He is a very brave person .
He is absolutely convinced that it is worth taking high personal risks in exchange for getting truth out to the community . ''
Among WikiLeaks ' volunteers , those who are close to Assange are similarly protective and reluctant to speak on the record .
They described on background this week a man whose traits would not be unexpected if they evolved from Mendax 's turbulent and nomadic formative years .
Assange , they say , is noticeably self reliant , self contained , resourceful and apt to keep a distance from others .
After his conviction , he stayed in Melbourne and built up his computer skills as programmer and as a developer of freeware .
He read widely on science and maths - he is largely self taught in most of his endeavours .
He did enrol for a period at Melbourne University but did not complete his studies in mathematics .
Less convincingly answered by those who know him is whether Assange 's quest to reveal secrets is the destiny of man moved by social conscience , or the natural progression of a highly intelligent child raised on the run , who found solace alone on a computer and anonymous camaraderie in cyber space .
For his epigraph in the online edition of Underground , Assange used an Oscar Wilde quote : '' Man is least himself when he talks in his own person .
Give him a mask , and he will tell you the truth . ''
Is Mendax the real Julian Assange ?
" Matt was very polite and explained what the screwdriver was .
But the guards just looked puzzled .
Fortunately he had some Doctor
Who promo material on him so was able to show them who he was .
Last June , we launched the Sputnik JavaScript conformance test suite , a comprehensive set of more than 5000 tests .
Today we 're releasing a test runner for Sputnik , that allows you to easily run the complete test suite from within your browser .
Sputnik touches all aspects of the JavaScript language defined in the 3rd edition of the ECMA - 262 spec .
In many ways it can be seen as a continuation of and a complement to existing browser conformance testing tools , such as the Acid3 test .
While we are always focused on improving speed , Sputnik is not about testing how fast your browser executes JavaScript , but rather whether it does so correctly .
Since we released the Sputnik tests as an open source project , the most requested feature has been the ability to run the tests in a browser , and we are excited to launch that functionality today .
The new test runner lets you run the tests from a single URL and quickly see the results in your browser .
This makes it easier both for users to see how well their browser conforms to the JavaScript spec , as well as for browser makers to find bugs and incompatibilities .
You can also use Sputnik to compare browser conformance .
For example , below is an experimental plot that compares five popular browsers and which we hope to update as new stable versions of the browsers are released .
We created this chart by running Sputnik in each of the five browsers and then plotting each browser such that the fewer tests a browser fails the closer it is to the center and the more failing tests two browsers have in common the closer they are placed to each other .
In this example , when running Sputnik on a Windows machine , we saw the following results : Opera 10.50 : 78 failures , Safari 4 : 159 failures , Chrome 4 : 218 failures , Firefox 3.6 : 259 failures and Internet Explorer 8 : 463 failures .
Alabama state troopers arrested a Jefferson , La. , man Wednesday on Interstate 65 after a note was found in a women 's rest room in Flomaton stating that a woman and two children had been kidnapped and were being taken to Atlanta .
Therral Hatfield , 25 , was charged with giving false information and carrying a pistol without permit after the car he was driving was stopped in Butler County , according to a state troopers statement issued this morning .
Troopers also found Latasha Hill of Jefferson and two children in the car .
The incident began about 3 p.m.
Wednesday when someone found the note stating that the three were being taken by force to Atlanta .
The Escambia County Sheriff 's Office called state troopers to report that the car could be going north on the interstate .
Using a vehicle description and license tag number in the note , a trooper stopped a car that matched the report at Exit 107 .
After the four were ordered out of the vehicle , the trooper found a . 45 - caliber pistol in the door of the car , the release states .
Agencies assisting with the traffic stop and continuing investigation are the Conecuh County Sheriff 's Department , Louisiana State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
The news made for titillating global headlines :
“ Smooching Brits banished from Dubai . ”
“ Blonde whose kiss could lead to jail . ”
But foreigners here in Dubai express little shock or outrage that twenty - something Brits Charlotte Adams and Ayman Najafi were given a month in prison for kissing in public late last year .
The appealed sentence was upheld by a judge here on Sunday .
Most foreigners express sympathy with the Dubai government ’s point of view – and amusement at the whole affair .
“ You have to respect the law of the land , ” says Reza , an Iranian - American who moved here in 2007 .
Although , he adds , “ my girlfriend is coming to visit , so I better watch out . ”
RELATED : What are the rules for public behavior in Dubai ?
Jana Barnard , a South African who ’s lived here for six years , says that “ when you come here you should check on what the rules are ....
The international media blows it out of proportion while the local media try to play it down . ”
Dubai attracts millions of tourists and expats with its beachside resorts , swank nightclubs , world 's tallest building , and relatively liberal social mores compared with some of the countries in the region .
But the police here occasionally crack down on foreigners ’ behavior that is considered offensive , ranging from sexual text messages , to wearing a mini skirt , to adulterous affairs and , in a highly publicized incident in 2008 , sex on a public beach .
It ’s unclear if the crime in this case was “ passionate ” kissing , as the Emirati mother who reported the incident alleged , or , as the couple claim , a peck on the cheek that Brits often offer as a customary greeting .
Few witnesses
The Emirati woman first said she and her children had witnessed the incident , while eating at Bob ’s Easy Diner at a beachfront promenade popular with Western expats .
" My daughter told me that the accused were kissing on the mouth .
Then I spotted them doing so myself .
I also saw them touching each other , as they were seated two to three meters away from our table , " she testified in court last month .
She later said only her children had seen the kissing .
Waiters at the restaurant , decked out in red and turquoise , recently told the Monitor that nobody there had witnessed the incident .
During a short hearing at the appeals court on Sunday , neither the couple nor their lawyer or witnesses were allowed to speak .
The judge upheld the couple 's conviction and fined them 1,000 dirhams ( about $ 270 ) each .
They now have 30 days to appeal the ruling in higher court , or serve the sentence before their deportation .
On Sunday , Ms. Adams told the Telegraph that she would not appeal to the higher - level cassation court as permitted so “ I can get on with my life . ”
Mr. Najafi , a resident in Dubai , may still appeal .
He faces possible deportation .
Both of their passports have been confiscated to prevent them from fleeing .
Hazy laws
Some expats interviewed expressed confusion at the uncertainty surrounding the laws on public display of affection .
Jessica Rusch , a visitor from Berlin , says that when her girl friend picked her up from the airport she warned that they should n’t give each other hello kisses .
Are women allowed to kiss on the cheek in public , she asks , or will they be considered lesbians breaking the law ?
Indian men hold hands on the street as part of their culture , she continues , is that allowed ?
Many foreigners say that , while it is important to respect local sensitivities , the punishment should fit the crime .
The Dubai authorities are " just trying to have some kind of regulations or else things will go haywire , ” says Amir , an Indian man who grew up in Dubai .
Still , he continues , “ You could just say ‘ stop . ’
They would probably stop .
You do n’t need to jail them or deport them . ”
After all , too much of a deterrent might undermine tourism and hurt the economy .
“ It seems a bit crazy , ” says Ian Morgan , who is visiting with his wife from Britain for a week .
“ It would probably put you off from coming here . ”

Firefox has thrown down the gauntlet in the race to take charge of your online identity , saying it will soon add identity management features to its browser , and hopes at some point to build recommendation services into the browser as well .
The move pits the Mozilla Foundation and its open - source model against the proprietary approach taken by Facebook , which recently launched a series of features that it hopes will convince users and websites to use Facebook profiles as their default login for online services , and to implement the social network ’s “ Like ” plugins as a universal standard .
The new addition to Firefox is called Account Manager , and it effectively transfers authority over logging in to various websites and services to the browser .
Using a single menu in the main toolbar of the browser , next to the address field , Firefox will be able to log a user — or multiple users — into and out of multiple services , and will even be able to generate random passwords for users who do n’t want to come up with their own .
The service will apparently also support any standard for authentication such as OpenID ( or presumably OAuth as well , which Facebook now supports ) , and is designed to be an open standard .
Firefox has effectively promoted the Account Manager plugin ( or add - on , as it calls them now ) from its Labs experimentation project to the official browser development stream .
The add - on is available as a beta here , and after some testing and development will be added to the shipping version of the browser .
The Firefox team said it is looking to “ ship this feature as soon as possible , ” and that adding support for it to an existing website or service should only take “ as little as 15 minutes of hacking . ”
It ’s clear that Firefox sees the browser as the primary agent that stands between a user and the services and websites she wants to visit .
That effectively means Firefox is going to go head - to - head with Facebook , which also wants to be the primary means by which users log in to websites and services .
According to the Firefox blog , the Account Manager add - on is just part of a larger “ online identity concept series ” that Mozilla Labs has been working on , which includes looking at all the ways the browser can help users interact with the web :
Your Web browser , as your most trusted relationship in your life online , has nearly perfect knowledge of everything you do on the Web .
We envision a world where your browser will play an even more active and critical role in helping you control and shape your online experience .
To realize this vision , we need to increase the browser ’s understanding of your online identity and provide a platform for building new capabilities that securely take advantage of this rich , dynamic set of data that represents the digital “ you . ”
According to Mozilla Labs , some of the ideas it ’s working on include managing account information , but also questions such as “ How can your browser help when you discover something cool on the Web that you want to share with your friends ? ” and also “ What can your browser do to enable you to securely share data with websites and third - parties in return for context - rich Web experiences ? ”
Those are both goals that will also bring the Firefox developer into direct competition with Facebook for access to user ’s data and personalization or recommendation features .
Identity online seems to have gone from being a two - way race , with Google and Facebook , to being a three - way contest .
May the best service win .

A 6.9 - magnitude earthquake struck off the southeast coast of Taiwan Monday morning , the United States Geological Survey said .
The earthquake hit at 10:59 a.m. Taiwan Standard Time , and was centered 170 miles east - southeast from the coast of Taitung , located in southern Taiwan .
The earthquake ’s magnitude was not enough to trigger a tsunami warning , the country ’s Central Weather Bureau said .
“ There is no tsunami warning at this time , ” a scientist at the weather bureau said .
The scientist , who did not want to identify himself , also said that his office had not heard of any immediate damage as a result of the earthquake .
The Associated Press reported that buildings swayed in Taipei , the capital , when the earthquake hit but that there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage .
14/04/2010 - New OECD figures show continuing growth in development aid in 2009 , despite the financial crisis .
Total net official development assistance ( ODA ) from the donors in the OECD ’s Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) rose 0.7 % in real terms , but the rise was 6.8 % once debt relief , a volatile item , is excluded ( see table for 2009 ) .
The OECD Secretary General , Angel Gurría , welcomed news of the further increase in ODA and urged donors to keep the momentum going in future years , despite their fiscal challenges .
“ Aid is less than 1 % of government spending on average in OECD countries while there is still much effort needed to reach the Millenium Development Goals .
This is a vital investment with big returns for the world as a whole ” he observed .
The DAC Chair , Eckhard Deutscher , pointed out that a clear majority of DAC members are meeting their aid commitments even in the face of the economic crisis .
Though there has been an encouraging increase in ODA to Africa , Deutscher pointed out that this fell well short of the Gleneagles target of a USD 25 billion increase by 2010 .
“ Aid financing remains vital to meet the MDGs , ” he observed , “ so all donors need to make the efforts necessary to meet their commitments . ”

Net ODA - ODA / GNI in 2009
ODA in 2009
In 2009 , total net official development assistance ( ODA ) from members of the OECD ’s Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) rose slightly in real terms ( +0.7 % ) to USD 119.6 billion , representing 0.31 % of DAC members ’ combined gross national income .
Debt relief , which had been especially high in 2005 and 2006 due to exceptional Paris Club packages for Iraq and Nigeria , fell sharply .
Excluding debt relief , the rise in ODA in real terms was +6.8 % .
If debt relief and humanitarian aid are excluded , bilateral aid for development programmes and projects rose by 8.5 % in real terms , as donors continued to scale up their core development projects and programmes .
Most of the rise was in new lending ( +20.6 % ) , but grants also increased ( +4.6 % , excluding debt relief ) .
In 2009 , net bilateral ODA to Africa was USD 27 billion , representing an increase of 3 % in real terms over 2008 .
USD 24 billion of this aid went to sub-Saharan Africa , an increase of 5.1 % over 2008 .
Donor performance
In 2009 , the largest donors by volume were the United States , France , Germany , the United Kingdom and Japan .
Five countries exceeded the United Nations ODA target of 0.7 % of GNI : Denmark , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Norway and Sweden .
The largest percentage increases in net ODA in real terms were from Norway , France , the United Kingdom , Korea ( which joined the DAC with effect from 1 January 2010 ) , Finland , Belgium and Switzerland .
Significant increases were also recorded in Denmark , Sweden and the United States .
In 2009 , the United States was the largest donor providing USD 28.7 billion in net ODA flows , representing an increase of 5.4 % in real terms over 2008 .
Its ODA / GNI ratio rose from 0.19 % in 2008 to 0.20 % in 2009 .
Total net US ODA flows increased to each region , particularly to sub-Saharan Africa ( +10.5 % to USD 7.5 billion ) .
ODA also increased significantly to Afghanistan ( +39.5 % to USD 3.0 billion ) .
US net ODA to the group of Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) increased by +13.6 % to USD 8.1 billion .
Japan ’s net ODA fell by 10.7 % in real terms to USD 9.5 billion , representing 0.18 % of its GNI .
The fall was mainly due to the fact that debt relief , notably for Iraq , fell compared to 2008 .
However , contributions to international financial institutions increased significantly in 2009 .
The combined net ODA of the fifteen members of the DAC that are EU members fell slightly ( - 0.2 % ) to USD 67.1 billion , representing 0.44 % of their combined GNI .
DAC -EU ODA represented 56 % of total DAC ODA .
In real terms , net ODA rose in seven DAC - EU countries as follows :
Belgium ( +11.5 % ) , due to a general scaling up of its aid ;
Denmark ( +4.2 % ) ;
Finland ( +13.1 % ) , as it increased its bilateral aid ;
France ( +16.9 % ) , due to an increase in bilateral lending and contributions to international organisations ;
Luxembourg ( +1.9 % ) ;
Sweden ( + 7.4 % ) , as it continued to achieve an ODA level of 1 % of its GNI ;
United Kingdom ( +14.6 % ) , reflecting the scaling up of its bilateral aid .
Aid fell in the following DAC - EU countries :
Austria ( - 31.2 % ) , due to reduced levels of debt relief compared with 2008 ;
Germany ( - 12.0 % ) , as reduced debt relief outweighed significant increased bilateral aid ;
Greece ( - 12 % ) , reflecting tightening ODA budgets due to fiscal pressure ;
Ireland ( - 18.9 % ) , due to budgetary pressures ;
Italy ( - 31.1 % ) , due to a decrease in overall aid and reduced debt relief ;
Netherlands ( - 4.5 % ) ;
Portugal ( - 15.7 % ) ;
Spain ( - 1.2 % ) though significant spending approved late in 2009 will only take effect in 2010 , maintaining the increasing trend of its ODA .
Aid by EU institutions rose by 4.4 % to USD 15.0 billion , mainly due to an increase in grant programmes .
Net ODA rose or fell in other DAC countries as follows :
Australia ( - 1.4 % ) due to high debt relief levels in 2008 which did not continue into 2009 ;
Canada ( - 9.5 % ) , following a large contribution to IDA in 2008 and a reduction in debt relief ;
Korea ( +13.5 % ) , due to an increase in bilateral loans ;
New Zealand ( - 3.2 % ) ;
Norway ( +17.3 % ) , due to an increase in its bilateral aid ;
Switzerland ( +11.5 % ) , due to special debt relief for Togo and increased costs for asylum seekers being counted in its ODA .
Gross ODA ( i.e. ODA without subtracting loan repayments ) in 2009 amounted to USD 132.7 billion ( see table for 2009 ) .
The largest donors were : the United States ( USD 29.5 billion ) , Japan ( USD 16.5 billion ) , France ( USD 15.3 billion ) , Germany ( USD 13.3 billion ) and the United Kingdom ( USD 11.7 billion ) .
The following non-DAC members reported changes in their net ODA in 2009 as follows :
Czech Republic ( - 4.7 % ) ;
Hungary ( +21.7 % ) , due to an increase in its bilateral programmes ;
Iceland ( - 11.7 % ) due to budgetary pressures ;
Poland ( +13.2 % ) ;
Slovak Republic ( - 18.9 % ) , as its bilateral assistance was reduced ;
Turkey ( +2.1 % ) .
What are the expected aid levels for 2010 ?
At the Gleneagles G8 and Millennium +5 summits in 2005 , donors made specific commitments to increase their aid .
When quantified by the OECD Secretariat , the pledges implied lifting aid from around USD 80 billion in 2004 to nearly USD 130 billion in 2010 , at constant 2004 prices , representing 0.36 % of estimated GNI in 2010 .
On 17 February 2010 , the OECD released its first estimate of the 2010 ODA outcome , based on a special review of donors ’ budget plans for 2010 .
This estimate has now been updated in light of the DAC donors ’ 2009 performance and some further adjustments to the 2010 targets .
In general , GNI reported by DAC donors for 2009 was slightly higher than previously estimated and the GNI prospects for 2010 are also slightly improved .
The OECD now estimates that the recent economic contraction has , by cutting nominal GNI , reduced the dollar value of the commitments made for 2010 to around USD 126 billion ( in constant 2004 dollars ) , or USD 46 billion over the 2004 level , compared with the original estimate of USD 50 billion .
While most countries have maintained their commitments for 2010 , others , including some large donors , have reduced or postponed the pledges they made for 2010 .
On the basis of current 2010 budget proposals and latest GNI figures :
The overall expected ODA level for 2010 is estimated at USD 108 billion expressed in 2004 dollars , an increase of USD 28 billion over the 2004 baseline , with the ODA / GNI ratio rising over the same period from 0.26 % to an estimated 0.32 % .
The shortfall is USD 18 billion ( in 2004 dollars ) against the 2005 commitments , once the effects of reduced GNI are taken into account ; this shortfall impacts particularly on Africa .
Expressed in 2009 prices , projected 2010 ODA is estimated at USD 126 billion , representing an increase of nearly USD 6 billion over 2009 .
Africa , in particular , is likely to receive only about USD 11 billion of the USD 25 billion increase envisaged at Gleneagles , due mainly to some European donors who give large shares of their official development assistance ( ODA ) to Africa not meeting their ambitious targets .
2010 is a key year for DAC - EU donors , who in 2005 aimed to reach a collective total of 0.56 % of GNI in net ODA for that year , with a minimum country target of 0.51 % .
2010 is also special for DAC - EU donors as it represents the midpoint between the 2005 commitments and the 2015 target date for meeting the 0.7 % ODA / GNI level .
Some will surpass that goal : Sweden , with the world ’s highest ODA as a percentage of its GNI at 1.01 % , is followed by Luxembourg ( 1 % ) , Denmark ( 0.83 % ) , the Netherlands ( 0.8 % ) , Belgium ( 0.7 % ) , the United Kingdom ( now estimated at 0.60 % ) , Finland ( 0.56 % ) , Ireland ( 0.52 % ) and Spain ( 0.51 % ) .
But others are unlikely to reach the target , although some have made significant progress since 2004 : France ( estimated at between 0.44 and 0.48 % , 0.46 % is used in the attached projections ) , Germany ( 0.40 % ) , Austria ( 0.37 % ) , Portugal ( 0.34 % ) , Greece ( 0.21 % ) , and Italy ( 0.20 % ) .
Other DAC countries made varying ODA commitments for 2010 , and most , but not all , will fulfil them .
The United States pledged to double its aid to sub-Saharan Africa between 2004 and 2010 and already attained this goal in 2009 .
Canada aimed to double its 2001 International Assistance Envelope level by 2010 in nominal terms , Australia aimed to reach $ A 4 billion , and New Zealand planned to reach 0.28 % of its GNI .
These three countries all appear on track to meet these objectives , and Australia and New Zealand have since set further targets for later years .
Norway will maintain its ODA level of 1 % of its GNI , and Switzerland will likely reach 0.47 % of its GNI , exceeding its previous commitment of 0.41 % .
Japan ’s Gleneagles promise was to give USD 10 billion more over the period 2005 to 2009 than if its ODA had stayed at its 2004 level over this period .
It fell short by USD 3.6 billion due mainly to severe economic and budgetary constraints , as well as significant early repayments on ODA loans by some borrowing countries .
For 2010 , Japan aims to increase its ODA , although since the exact level is not yet known the projections below use the 2009 figure for the time being .
Despite various shortfalls against commitments , ODA increased by nearly 30 % in real terms between 2004 and 2009 , and is expected to rise by about 36 % in real terms between 2004 and 2010 .
ODA as a percentage of GNI rose from 0.26 % in 2004 to 0.31 % in 2009 and is expected to rise to 0.32 % in 2010 .
This is the largest volume increase ever in ODA over such a period and does not depend on the large increase in debt relief which boosted the aid numbers in 2005 - 07 .
The continued growth in ODA has shown that aid pledges are effective when backed up with adequate resources , political will and firm multi- year spending plans .
ODA will continue to rise in 2010 , unlike other financial flows to developing countries which have fallen sharply since the onset of the global financial crisis .

Riverside County businessman Stewart Hauptman ’s latest venture gives new meaning to the term “ recreational drugs . ”
Until recently , he sold marijuana for medical use from a souped - up RV he parked outside a Norco clinic .
He refurbished a 1985 Pace Arrow motor home , installing display cases , a baked - goods section and other amenities .
He named the operation the Lakeview Collective - on - Wheels and parked the converted RV in a lot outside the clinic , where people were being evaluated for medical marijuana use .
“ That way , when patients came out of the clinic , they are able to get the medicine right away , ” said Hauptman , a Riverside County videographer - turned - cannabis - entrepreneur .
But the city of 27,000 , which bans the distribution of marijuana , went to court last week in a bid to shut down Hauptman ’s business , which has been cited several times since it opened in October .
“ We ’ll take whatever proper legal action is needed to get them to cease , ” said City Atty .
John Harper .
Hauptman and his wife , Helen , said they are being persecuted for trying to provide a humanitarian service for seriously ill people in great pain .
Most of their clients are elderly , many confined to wheelchairs and using walkers , they said .
“ These are not young kids who go out and get stoned ; this is not about that , ” Hauptman said .
“ These are older people , some dying from cancer . ”
But Norco officials claim the couple ’s portrayal of their clientele does not match police observations .
“ We ’ve seen people , generally speaking , between the ages of 18 and 25 who appear to be in good health lined up outside there to buy marijuana , ” Harper said .
All marijuana distribution is banned in Norco , regardless if it is dispensed from a vehicle , he said .
A hearing on whether to shut down the business permanently is scheduled June 1 in Riverside County Superior Court .
A landmark 1996 voter initiative legalized marijuana for medical use in California , but the question of whether cities are legally entitled to ban distribution is pending before state appeals courts .
Medical marijuana advocates say state law allows cities to regulate the trade but not ban it .
Officials from Norco and other cities say local governments may outlaw dispensaries .
The Hauptmans said their business is legal -- and essential .
It features “ a delicious and fresh assortment of Cannabis - infused edible treats , ” according to a related website .
The herb - spiked brownies , cookies , pretzels and other items cost about $ 10 a serving , the couple said .
Marijuana sells for about $ 450 an ounce .
Their business operates in conjunction with a clinic , Serenity Medical Evaluations , located in a chiropractor ’s office in a Norco strip mall .
Helen Hauptman manages the clinic .
It worked like this :
The RV parked in a dirt lot next to the shopping center during the four hours each week the clinic was open .
Only patients referred by the clinic could join the collective and buy its medical marijuana , said Helen Hauptman .
The collective has more than 600 members , she said .
“ It ’s like a store on wheels , ” said Helen Hauptman , who uses medical marijuana to treat chronic back pain .
Official pressure has forced the mobile cannabis to shut down for now , the couple said .
“ I ’m being watched by police , ” Stewart Hauptman said .
The couple is now delivering marijuana to clients ’ homes , but not with the RV .
“ We ’re using a truck , ” Helen Hauptman said .
LOS ANGELES 
When Conan O’Brien wanted to start a Web site last winter , he was reminded that he did not own his dot - com name , ConanOBrien.com .
Gainfully employed by NBC for some two decades , a personal Web site had hardly been a priority until , well , his tenure as host of “ The Tonight Show ” screeched to an end in January .
Suddenly he needed a new platform .
He joined Twitter , and last month , helped by just a few tweets , Mr. O’Brien largely sold out his 30 - city comedy tour , which starts on Monday in Eugene , Ore .
Mr. O’Brien was a Web Luddite , but now he is making up for lost time .
He resembles many other entertainers who have turned their corners of the Web into self - referential , self - promotional sales tools , but he stands out for his humor and his speed of adoption .
Case in point : he has been picking a Twitter fight with Justin Bieber , the 16 - year - old singer who has 1.75 million followers on that site , almost one million more than Mr. O’Brien .
Because ConanOBrien.com is owned by an online squatter , Mr. O’Brien ’s representatives decided to adopt Team Coco , one of his fans ’ chosen names , as the host ’s own .
They even licensed a fan ’s artwork for the tour poster .
TeamCoco.com is a single Web page now , but as the tour gets under way , the site is to expand .

The Perl community seems abuzz about the cool new cpanminus client by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa .
After about two weeks of development , this is a reasonably functional CPAN client with just a fraction of the overhead , complexity and verbosity of the CPAN and CPANPLUS clients that come with the Perl core .
It ’s a remarkable achievement , not only technically , but in the reaction it has sparked .
As one of the ( sometimes reluctant ) maintainers of CPAN and CPANPLUS , I ’ve realized that I both love and hate cpanminus .
I love that Miyagawa has done so much with so little and in such a short span of time
I hate that fanboy - types flocked to it and trashed the older clients without noting cpanminus ’ limitations
I love that Perl toolchain maintainers have rallied around Miyagawa and contributed their wisdom to make cpanminus better instead of rejecting it
I hate that one of Perl ’s great strengths ( CPAN ) has legacy clients that are so unwieldy , hated and difficult to maintain
Miyagawa graciously acknowledges standing on the shoulders of giants .
Still , I ca n’t shake the nagging thought that cpanminus should never have been necessary in the first place .
What I ’ve come to realize is that cpanminus is another example of the power of not being all things to all people .
Miyagawa does n’t promise that it works for all of CPAN or that it works everywhere that Perl does .
He does n’t have to .
Making it work for 99 % of CPAN for 99 % of people is more than good enough .
I ’ve been co-maintaining various parts of the Perl toolchain for a while now .
It ’s a frustrating challenge needing to make thing work everywhere , for everything , and trying as hard as possible not to break backwards compatibility .
Plus , I do n’t even get to use CPAN to make life easier .
I do n’t get to use handy tools like Moose or DateTime or Regexp : : Common or SQLite or anything in the Config ::* namespace or even basic tools like Archive : : Zip .
Nearly everything is done by hand .
Things have to work with just core
Perl on a diverse set of platforms and with an incredibly limited set of assumptions .
For example , the Perl core still does n’t come with an HTTP client , so CPAN has to rely on FTP or command line programs to bootstrap LWP .
( This is something I personally plan to tackle during the Perl 5.13 development series later this year . )
I think this is an ongoing challenge for core Perl development in general .
It ’s a lot of work to be all things to all people and I keep wondering whether making things simpler and better for 99 % of people would be a better choice .
( Anyone else for use strict by default ?
I hope that finally comes to pass in Perl 5.14 . ) chromatic writes about this topic often in his Modern Perl blog and I usually tend to agree with the points he makes .
( October February 2009 had a particularly good series of posts . )
In the meantime , I look at cpanminus with greed and envy .

The speed of sound — historically called the ‘ sound barrier ’ – has been broken by rockets , various jet - powered aircraft and rocket - boosted land vehicles .
Felix Baumgartner wants to break the sound barrier with his body , in freefall from the edge of space .
He will travel inside a capsule with a stratospheric balloon to 36,500 meters ( 120,000 feet ) step out and attempt a freefall jump targeted to reach – for the first time in history – supersonic speeds .
“ After years of training with my team of dedicated Red Bull Stratos experts , I ’ll be going on a journey that no one has ever done , ” Baumgartner told Universe Today in an email message .
“ If I succeed , I will be the first person to break the sound barrier , alone .
That will be a record for all eternity .
As such , a piece of me will become immortal .
That excites me . ”
Back in 1960 , a US Air Force captain named Joe Kittinger made aerospace history by making a jump from 31,000 meters ( 102,800 feet ) .
His jump contributed valuable data that provided ground work for spacesuit technology and knowledge about human physiology for the US space program .
There have been several attempts to surpass Kittinger ’s record , but none have succeeded , and people have given their lives for the quest .
Sometime during 2010 , Baumgartner will make an attempt in his “ Red Bull Stratos ” mission — named after the energy drink company that co-created the program with the Austrian skydiver .
Red Bull Stratos team members say the mission will explore the limits of the human body in one of the most hostile environments known to humankind , in the attempt to deliver valuable lessons in human endurance and high - altitude technology .
“ This is the biggest goal I can dream of , ” Baumgartner said .
“ If we can prove that you can break the speed of sound and stay alive I think that is a benefit for future space exploration . ”
If Baumgartner is successful , the Red Bull Stratos mission will break four world records : the altitude record for freefall , the distance record for longest freefall , the speed record for fastest freefall by breaking the speed of sound with the human body , and the altitude record for the highest manned balloon flight .
How fast will Baumgarter need to go to beat the speed of sound ?
Sound travels at different speeds through the atmosphere ( as well as through different mediums ) , depending on atmospheric density and temperature .
For example , at sea level , in average conditions of about 15 degrees C ( 59 degrees F ) , sound travels at around 1,223 kph ( 760 mph ) .
But at higher altitudes , where the air is colder , sound travels more slowly .
Researchers with the Red Bull Stratos mission anticipate Baumgartner could break the sound barrier at about 30,480 meters ( 100,000 feet ) above sea level , in temperatures of - 23 to - 40 C ( - 10 to - 40 F ) where sound travels at about 1,110 kph ( 690 mph ) or roughly 304 meters per second ( 1,000 feet per second ) .
So , he ’ll have to go faster than those speeds – or Mach 1 — to be supersonic .
While there is no literal “ barrier , ” the transition to supersonic speeds can cause problems for aircraft as transonic air movement creates disruptive shock waves and turbulence .
Data obtained from Chuck Yeager ’s first supersonic flight in 1947 allowed for changes in design of supersonic aircraft to avoid problems .
Still , some aircraft still experience problems , and going supersonic has been attributed to some air disasters .
And the human body is n’t designed for supersonic speeds .
“ Our biggest concern is that we do n’t know how a human unencumbered by aircraft is going to transition through this , ” said the project ’s Medical Director Dr. Jonathan Clark , a flight surgeon for six space shuttle missions ( and husband of astronaut Laurel Clark who died in the Columbia disaster in 2003 ) , who has researched numerous aerospace disasters .
“ But it ’s also exactly what we ’re hoping to learn , for the benefit of future space flights . ”
Documents provided by the Red Bull Stratos mission say that the data obtained from the mission will be shared with the scientific community , and Clark notes that he expects long - awaited medical protocols to be established as a result .
At the low temperatures and tenuous atmospheric conditions that Baumgartner will experience , he could suffer from hypothermia , the bends –if he gains altitude too fast during ascent – , or he could experience ebullism – the infamous condition where gas bubbles can form in the blood , and the blood basically “ boils . ”
That ’s why his spacesuit is so important .
“ I have absolute confidence the suit is going to work , ” said Daniel McCarter , Program Manager for the David Clark Company , the same company that made Kittinger ’s suit back in 1960 , as well as full pressure suits for NASA astronauts and military pilots flying in aircraft that can reach the edge of the atmosphere .
“ Every time someone jumps a suit system like this there is something to learn .
We learn knowledge for future systems . ”
Art Thompson , the mission ’s Technical Project Director , added , “ We are ultimately risking life .
Felix realizes that his life is on the line .
Our job is to do everything we can from an engineering and technical point of view to keep him safe . ”
The suit Baumgartner will use is custom - made for him , so there should be no pressure points caused by the suit that would make him uncomfortable , but any pressure suit restricts mobility and dexterity .
He will have to avoid movements that could cause him to go into an uncontrollable spin .
Baumgartner is not new to jumping .
He owns several world records for B.A.S.E. jumping and is well known for skydiving across the English Channel in 2003 .
He is also a parachutist , stunt coordinator and a commercial helicopter pilot .
“ I think I ’ve always been one of those guys who wanted to be in the places where no one has been before .
It ’s inside your body or brain , ” Baumgartner said in a video on the Red Bull Stratos website .
“ When I was a kid , I liked to climb up trees – I always wanted to be on top of something . ”
This will definitely be an attempt to go where no one has gone before .

" These documents provide further evidence that senior CIA officials were willing to risk being prosecuted for obstruction of justice in order to avoid being prosecuted for torture , " said Ben Wizner , a lawyer with the ACLU .
" If the Department of Justice fails to hold these officials accountable , they will have succeeded in their cover - up . "
I think what we 're seeking is an experience of being alive , so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonance within our own innermost being and reality , so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive .
That 's what it 's all finally about .
Marc Savard will travel to Buffalo this afternoon and participate in tomorrow ’s morning skate .
Savard visited with Dr. Kelly McInnis this morning , and although he had n’t gotten any results , he believes he has been cleared for contact .
Tomorrow will be the first time Savard skates with his teammates , although given the nature of morning skates , it does n’t project to be a high - tempo session .
“ Just getting my wind back , ” Savard said .
“ You can do biking or whatever you want .
But nothing ’s like being on the ice .
Just keep taking it a day at a time and get stronger that way . ”

In the second temptation of Jesus in the desert , the devil offered Jesus political power .
Jesus turned him down .
The American bishops — or rather their leadership and staff — succumbed .
How heady it must have felt for those staffers from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops who were present in the room with Rep.
Bart Stupak when he was negotiating with Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the anti-abortion language in the House health care reform bill .
But what the lords of this world give , they can take away .
How bitter it must have been for these same staffers when Congressman Stupak worked out a reasonable compromise with the administration — an executive order clarifying the anti-abortion language of the Senate bill — so that the Congressman , acting as a pro-life Catholic layman , with a fully - informed conscience , could vote for the Senate version of the health care reform bill .

The Catholic Church has always been a strong supporter of universal health care , ever since Pope John XXIII included it in his list of basic human rights in his encyclical , Pacem in Terris .
Yet when the United States finally adopted near ( not complete ) universal coverage , the bishops of the United States found themselves opposed to it for reasons that were , at best , hard to decipher .
The bishops ’ arguments against the Senate bill seemed to come down to suspicions that :
1 . The Senate bill did not incorporate the exact language of the Hyde amendment as the House bill did , but it did make Hyde ’s restrictions applicable by reference to Hyde .
Therefore reject the Senate bill , the bishops said , because if the Hyde amendment is ever not renewed by Congress , then the Senate bill lacks specific protections against federal health care dollars being used to fund abortions .
In this doomsday scenario , the bishops ignored the obvious : A congress with enough votes to reject the Hyde amendment would also have enough votes to put abortion coverage into any existing federal health care legislation .
2 . The bill funds Community Health Centers that receive federal dollars , and these centers could start doing abortions .
Therefore reject the Senate bill , the bishops said .
But CHCs have never done abortions .
Their sole role is to see that poor people have access to basic primary health care , not specialized operations .
And they are prohibited from performing abortions by federal regulation , and the Hyde Amendment , which does not allow any federal dollars , including those provided to Community Health Centers , to be used for abortions .
When President George W. Bush doubled federal support for Community Health Centers during his Administration , by opening 1200 new or expanded service sites between 2002 and 2006 , the bishops raised no concerns about abortion funding .
3 . The Senate bill requires that one insurance plan per state include abortion coverage , and if this should happen to be the best plan , Catholics who want optimal coverage will have to join and subsidize abortions with their premiums .
Therefore reject the Senate bill , the bishops said .
But under the terms of the bill abortion coverage in any plan is to be paid for with separate premium dollars , not general premium dollars .
And these dollars have to be segregated , just as federal grants to Catholic social service agencies have to be segregated so that the government is paying only for neutral charitable services and not for religious activities .
If segregation of funds works there , why not here ?
And the idea that the “ best ” plan , the one that all the Catholics will want to buy , will be the one plan that includes abortion coverage is hardly a given .
Political Distortions
The bishops were not fighting the real Senate bill .
They were fighting a distortion of the bill .
Where did these distortions come from ?
Not from the bishops or their staff — although they were complicit in repeating them .
Rather , they came from the far - right groups with whom the bishops in their pursuit of political power found themselves aligned .
But unlike the bishops , who truly wished to get the best health care bill possible , their allies wanted no health care bill at all .
They wanted , as they have often repeated , to see President Obama fail .
Proof of this alliance ?
One telling example : a week before the final debate in the House the bishops ’ staff wrote a press release disputing a pro-life analysis by Professor of Law Timothy Jost that supported the Senate bill .
This release was posted on the Web site of the National Right to Life Committee a full - day before it showed up on the bishops ’ own Web site and even before it was given to the press .
So who wrote it ?
Was it the NRLC , which is funded , in part , by the Republican National Committee ?
The NRLC is one of Obama ’s most vehement critics .
Why are our bishops cooperating with these political operatives ?
Neither political party is perfect .
They each have their own agendas and each will always act in their own , not the church ’s , best interests , and each will seek to use the church if they can .
That is what partisanship is all about .
But our bishops cannot afford to seem partisan .
The perception of political partisanship on the part of the bishops is destructive of their credibility .
On complex political issues like the dense language of the Senate health care reform bill , our bishops are not experts , nor , truth to tell , are their staffs — at least not in comparison to the wizards on Capitol Hill .
Instead of getting involved in the technicalities of the legislative language , which is not a matter of dogma or theology , the bishops would have been better served to state what they authoritatively could :
No Catholic could support a legislative extension of abortion in the guise of health care .
Then let the lay people do what they do best : work out the details .
The bishops must leave the political answers , the how of solving political problems , even when those problems have a moral component , to the informed consciences of the laity .
Political strategy is not a question of faith .
How odd that in the final analysis , the bishops found themselves on the opposite side of their own standard - bearer , Congressman Stupak , when he voted for the Senate version , backed up by a clarifying executive order .
There could hardly be a more pro-life member of Congress .
But the bishops , again going where they have no expertise , attacked President Obama ’s executive order as ineffective .
But executive orders are law , and in the history of our country they have had breath - taking effects .
Harry Truman desegregated the armed forces with an executive order .
Dwight Eisenhower , John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson used executive orders to end segregation in the schools and discrimination in federal programs .
George W. Bush used an executive order to limit the lines of embryonic stem cells available for federally - funded research .
No bishop ever said any of these were ineffective .
Congressman Stupak himself , in response to the bishops ’ criticism of his compromise , pointedly said he had heard no Catholic bishop argue that Bush ’s executive resolution to prohibit federal funding for some embryonic stem cell research was not enough .
Rather , all he heard from the bishops on that issue , he said , was praise for President Bush .
There was no praise for President Obama and his executive resolution stating that no federal funds allocated under the health care reform bill could be used for abortions .
Could that be the real problem ?
Have our bishops become so partisan that they cannot accept anything that President Obama does because he is unrelentingly accused of being “ the most pro-abortion president ” America has ever elected ?
Are they unwilling to cooperate with the Democratic Party does because it is constantly caricatured as the “ party of death ” ?
How much longer can they cling to these illusions when the health care reform law includes provisions such as life affirming “ Support for Pregnant Women ’s Act / “ Pregnant Women ’s Support Act , ” which funds $ 250 million of support for vulnerable pregnant women and alternatives to abortion ?
So the bishops found themselves opposed to a law that would provide health care insurance to 30 million uninsured Americans , vastly improve health care insurance coverage for the rest of us , and prevent annually an estimated 45,000 deaths from a lack of adequate health care .
And why ?
For the amorphous anxiety that the health care reform bill might perhaps somewhere , somehow , someday underwrite someone ’s abortion ?
How , in any rational sense of justice , does that uncertainty outweigh the pro-life certainties of this law ?
I am saddened that our sacred pastors , men whom I truly admire , allowed themselves to be led into a partisan cul - de-sac that they found impossible to exit .
I know that they are wise enough to work their way out of this dead - end eventually , but meanwhile the damage to their credibility in being truly pro-life , and not merely pro-life for partisan purposes , is immense .
Members of the U.S. bishops ' conference respond to Nicholas P. Cafardi .
April 1 , 2010  --
Hopes are running high that Friday 's jobs data will bring happy news .
Economists predict the Labor Department will announce that 190,000 jobs were added in March , according to a Reuters poll .
If true , it would be only the second monthly payroll gain since the recession began in 2007 .
The forecast is especially optimistic , considering that ADP Employer Services reported Wednesday that U.S. companies had slashed a surprisingly high 23,000 positions in March .
But even if labor 's numbers turn out positive , Wilton , Conn. , resident Sean Byrnes wo n't pay it much attention .
About a month ago , the 41 - year - old father of four lost his job as a salesman at a Manhattan - based financial research firm .
He has struggled to find so much as even a job interview since then .
" I talk to headhunters and they say the same thing , " he says .
" No one is hiring . "
Huge Cash Reserves
One piece of economic data that has caught the attention of Byrnes , and others in his predicament , is a fairly staggering figure that comes out of the Bureau of Economic Analysis : Despite widespread unemployment , the BEA reports that U.S. corporations , reluctant to expand in an uncertain economy , are sitting on $ 1.6 trillion in cash reserves , a record amount , according to BEA economist Greg Key .
Even looking at the companies in the Standard & Poor 's 500 index of blue chips -- and stripping out financials , which are required by regulators to keep large cash reserves in order to cushion against risk -- the cash on hand number is still rather monstrous : $ 1.1 trillion .
To put that in perspective , as a percentage of companies ' total market capitalization , that $ 1.1 trillion is more than double the ratio seen before the crisis .
" Cash is piling up faster than companies can figure out what to do with it , " said David Bianco , head of U.S. equity strategy at Bank of America .
Asked about the mountain of corporate money sitting on the sidelines , the out - of - work Byrnes offered his own suggestion for what to do with it .
" Companies should absolutely spend some of that money to put people back to work , " Byrnes said by telephone earlier this week , clearly frustrated .
" I suppose they need to make shareholders happy , but come on already . "
Companies Not Spending Cash on New Hires
Actually , according to Bianco , shareholders will soon start to demand that cordoned off cash be put to work , either through some form of growth initiative or at the very least used to pay out a higher dividend .
In either case , it 's not expected that the cash being hoarded will at any point translate into rapid hiring .
" Companies slashed their work forces and now find that they could function far more resourcefully than they ever realized possible , " Bianco said .
" If anything , we could start to see some of the money being used to expand overseas or to acquire other companies .
In either case , that does not bode well for job creation .
In fact , mergers lead to job reductions unfortunately . "
Bianco expects 9 percent - plus unemployment to persist though the end of next year .
In other words , if there is a recovery it will be slight and a jobless one , as many have feared .
Government 's Hiring Push
The government , meanwhile , is working hard to spur hiring .
Alan Krueger , assistant secretary for economic policy at the US Department of the Treasury , points out that President Obama recently signed a jobs creation act known as HIRE which includes a variety of incentives .
HIRE , for example , exempts companies from paying social security payroll tax if they hire someone who has been out of work for more than two months , and offers them a $ 1000 cash bonus if they retain the worker for a full year .
He adds that the administration has also been focused on stabilizing financial markets and fuelling consumer demand , two measures which in the long run should start boosting the need for workers .
" We 've been trying to set conditions so companies can feel more confident to expand , " says Krueger , pointing to efforts such as the Financial Stability Plan and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
" As companies become more confident that markets have stabilized , they will be more willing to take risks and invest their cash reserves . "
Hiring to Make Money
Regardless of how many hiring incentives the government passes , experts say the jobs market faces a long , tough recovery .
Companies simply wo n't begin to hire workers unless they see a valid business reason to do so .
As long as the economic outlook remains cloudy , employers will continue to hold on to their reserves , predicts Rene Stulz , a finance professor at Ohio State University and an expert in cash reserves .
" It makes sense to put cash [...] in hiring people if you can make money .
It does n't make sense to take the cash and hire people if you 're going to make losses , " he said .
Despite living in an age of iPads and hybrid cars , young Americans are more like the young adults of the early 1900s than the baby boom generation :
They are living at home longer , are financially insecure and are making lower wages .
Indeed , a new study points out that a 22 - year - old of today might have much more in common with his or her grandfather or great - grandfather than their own parents , although the reasons for this prolonged journey to adulthood differ from Americans of 100 years ago .
And one huge difference between 2010 and 1910 : young people today are being supported financially by their parents , instead of helping to support their parents as they might have in the early 20th century .
The study , titled , " What 's Going on with Young People Today ?
The Long and Twisting Path to Adulthood " was written by Richard Settersten , a professor of human development and family sciences at Oregon State University , and Barbara Ray , president of Hired Pen , Inc. Settersten has conducted much of his scientific research as part of the decade - long MacArthur Research Network on Transitions to Adulthood .
The study was published in the journal Transition to Adulthood , a new publication from The Future of Children , a joint project between Princeton University and the Washington , D.C. - based Brookings Institution think tank .
The journal will be released at a public event at Brookings .
The middle of the last century is often used as a comparison for judging young people today .
But Settersten and Ray reveal that that the baby boom generation is an anomaly .
Young people in the early decades of the 1900s were slow to leave their family homes and start families .
Becoming an adult then , as now , was a gradual process characterized by " semi-autonomy , " with young people waiting until they were self - sufficient to set up their own households , marry and have children .
In the post - World War II boom , high - paying industrial jobs were plentiful , and a prosperous economy enabled workers with high school degrees ( or less ) and college degrees alike to find secure employment with decent wages and benefits .
Since then , downward trends in wages and economic opportunities can be directly linked to young people staying at home longer , returning home later , and postponing or even forgoing marriage and children .

" Having an income that 's adequate to support oneself and a family -- or at least the ability to earn one -- has always been a precursor to living independently and taking on adult roles , such as marrying and settling down , " he said .
Some key facts from their article include :
In 2005 , even before the current recession , roughly three in 10 white men ( up to age 34 ) with a high school degree were not in school , in the military or at work .
For young black men , the numbers were even higher :
More than half were not in school , in the military or at work .
Even those who do get an education are not as likely as their counterparts in the 1960s and 1970s to get a good paying job .
Young men ( 25 - 34 years ) with a high school degree or less earned about $ 4,000 less in 2002 than in 1975 ( with earnings adjusted for inflation ) .
Men with some college also lost ground , earning about $ 3,500 a year less in 2002 than in 1975 .
Every single group , except those with graduate - level college education , had greater amounts of people earning below poverty level in 2002 than in 1975 .
In 1969 , only about 10 percent of men in their early thirties had wages that were below poverty level .
By 2004 , the share had more than doubled .
Overall , the share of young adults in 2005 living in poverty was higher than the national average .
There are also many differences between now and the early decades of the last century , of course , which Settersten and Ray illustrate .
One of the biggest differences is that young people today do n't contribute to the household as they once did .
Instead , parents shoulder the burden of launching their children into adulthood .
" Parents are now being called on to provide financial and other kinds of assistance to their young adult children , " Ray said .
" A century ago , the opposite was true .
Then , young adults often helped their parents when they went to work and especially if they still lived together . "
New evidence shows that parents are spending 10 percent of their annual income to help their adult children , regardless of their income level .
" And that 's a whole lot of money for some kids to get -- and for many parents to give , or to afford , " Settersten said .
Despite all the discussion of kids staying at home longer or coming back later , Settersten said , it is important to remember there remains a sizable period of living independently from parents in early adulthood today .
The percentages of people who have never mar­ried and who are intentionally childless are also higher now than at any other time in American history .
" Today , the young adult years are filled up with many different kinds of living arrangements , some of which more often involve parents , " he said .
" But what is perhaps more significant is the fact that these arrangements do n't as often involve spouses . "
Now in the midst of a recession , pressures on middle class families are great , Settersten and Ray note .
The longer path to adulthood strains not only families but also the institutions that have traditionally supported young Americans in making that transi­tion -- such as residential colleges and universities , community colleges , military service , and national service programs .
The authors emphasize the need to strengthen these institutions to better reflect the times .
" Only by continuing or increasing investments in young people after the age of 18 can policy makers implement the supports needed to make the road to adulthood less draining for families and less perilous for young people , " Settersten said .
Here are some insights on surrender from various spiritual teachers , paths , and poets that I have found comforting and inspiring .
At the end , I share a moving instrumental piece by pianist Solomon Keal from his beautiful album Peace of Heaven .
Some of us have to be dragged , kicking and screaming , before we let go , and so there tends to be more struggle in the process .
For others , it ’s not a lot of struggle .
Their conditioning and preparation is different .
Mourning is a dramatic word , but the basic process is the same .
There ’s no way around that .
Whatever the path and however the practitioner comes to it , the path turns on the working through of loss , acceptance and surrender — at every moment , but especially in the process of awakening .
Jack Engler – Practicing for Awakening
However innumerable beings are , I vow to meet them with kindness and interest .
However inexhaustible the states of suffering are , I vow to touch them with patience and love .
However immeasurable the Dharmas are , I vow to explore them deeply .
However incomparable the mystery of interbeing , I vow to surrender to it freely .
The Boddhisattva Vow – Thich Nhat Hanh
All dualistic confusion will dissolve when your surrender to God is genuine and when you are willing to be your autonomous self .
If you follow through you will no longer be confused about individuality versus community ; about self - surrender versus self - hood and real independence .
True self - hood creates a social being who is not at odds with his or her surroundings .
On the contrary , this kind of person is intimately connected with others and always contributes to them .
Truly autonomous people can be strong leaders , as well as willing followers , because their vision is clear and their selfhood is centered in divine reality .
The Pathwork by Eva Broch Pierrakos
Say :
We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed
To Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob , and the tribes ,
And in the books of Moses , Jesus , and the prophets ,
From their Lord .
We make no distinction between one and another
And to God do we surrender our will .
The Koran
This Yoga does not mean the rejection of the powers of life , but an inner transformation and a change of the spirit in the life and the use of the powers .
These powers are now used in an egoistic spirit and for undivine ends ; they have to be used in a spirit of surrender to the Divine and for the purpose of the divine Work .
Sri Aurobindo
I delight to do thy will , O my God : yea , thy law is within my heart .
My meditation of him shall be sweet : I will be glad in the Lord .
The Bible
No matter what else we do in meditation , just by the fact of sitting down and giving up the tasks with which we normally clothe ourselves , we are challenging our very sense of self .
We ’re testing the possibility of giving up these roles and just being what we actually are .
This takes trust .
You have to trust yourself to the ground when you sit on it .
You have to trust yourself to the practice , to let yourself be held by it and give up , surrender .
You want to say , “ I ’ve got to do something . ”
But you ca n’t do this .
We can ’t , finally , do our practice , just as we ca n’t do ourselves into a state of calm or a state of keen discernment .
We can set up the conditions for it to arise , and that ’s where grace or blessings or inspiration comes in .
Anne Carolyn Klein – Grounded by The Earth
To live in this world
you must be able
to do three things :
to love what is mortal ;
to hold it
against your bones knowing
your own life depends on it ;
and , when the time comes to let it go ,
to let it go .
Mary Oliver
And here is the beautiful piano music of Solomon Keal .
The song is called “ Surrender , ” from his beautiful Peace of Heaven album .
Here is the iTunes Store link :
http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/surrender/id208134057?i=208134269
“ Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart , and try to love the questions themselves .
Do not seek the answers that cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them .
And the point is to live everything .
Live the questions now .
Perhaps you will gradually , without noticing it , live along some distant day , into answers . ”
Rainer Maria Rilke

If you want to “ go big ” visually with a website , delivering complex interaction and a rich experience across a wide range of browsers , Flash is the only way to go .
Right ?
Nope .
Given the widespread adoption and advancements of modern browsers and JavaScript libraries , using Flash makes little sense .
But it does have its place on the Web , considering the need for progressive enhancement .
In the current landscape of technology and accessing the Internet through devices such as picture frames , netbooks , cell phones and televisions , the benefits of Web standards outweigh those of Flash , especially when delivering content to a broad audience on various devices .
Please consider reading our related articles :
Flash is a proprietary product that sits on top of the browser to extend functionality .
While Flash may have provided missing functionality for some time , it brings little value to modern browsers .
As more and more designers and developers realize the benefits of Web standards and start using some of the features of HTML5 and CSS3 , we ’ll see fewer Flash - driven websites .
The Great Flash vs. Web Standards Debate
Advocates have evangelized Web standards for over 10 years .
The debate among developers and designers often gets as heated as the discussion on same - sex marriage , causing uncomfortable divisions among some of the smartest people in the field .
With the recent announcement of iPad ’s lack of Flash support and the continued lack of it on the iPhone , the debate has reached beyond the development community to include Adobe and Apple themselves .
With Apple ’s anti-Flash stance , it has become too hard to argue for a completely Flash - based website when it would leave out a potentially large audience .
Eventually , Flash will make it to mobile devices ( 250 million devices are expected to have full support by the end of 2012 ) , but that ’s really only a small part of the debate and one of the better arguments that Web standards advocates have .
At the heart of the matter is how to deliver a great experience to users no matter the technology or platform .
“ HTML5 vs. Flash ” is the wrong discussion .
“ Accessible rich media ” is the right one .
— Jeffrey Zeldman ( via Twitter )
In the end , we ’re all just trying to create websites that can be accessed and used , regardless of the tools we use to deliver them .
Healthy Competition
In the early days of the Web , Flash was pretty much the only way to deliver a rich experience across different browsers and platforms .
CSS and JavaScript were inconsistently supported across browsers , and relying on them was hardly worth the trouble .
( Image : Erik Charlton )
Flash saw great success early on and pushed forward quickly .
The small app that once mainly made animations quickly became a worthy development environment in its own right .
Developers and designers alike chose to concentrate their efforts in that area , often segregating themselves from the open Web and backing the proprietary technology .
Flash websites took over the Web , and Web standards did n’t allow developers to create the experiences that users were starting to expect .
Web standards may have fallen behind once , but they continued to be pushed forward by practitioners and those willing to embrace the idea of an open Web .
Web Standards : Benefits And Reasons For Adoption
Users expect rich experiences , and in many cases these great experiences are now being delivered with HTML , CSS and JavaScript , which are the basics of Web standards .
( Image : The US Army )
The line between websites developed with Flash and Web standards has become blurred .
At first glance , even the savviest developer would have a hard time discerning which technology was used for a website without peeking at the source .
The list of websites that are ditching Flash in favor of Web standards is growing every day .
Even if these decisions are driven by the iPad and iPhone ’s lack of Flash , they ’ll soon reap the other benefits that Web standards bring .
Current Trends
What once could be done almost exclusively in Flash is now easily accomplished with JavaScript and a bit of ingenuity .
Lightboxing , scrolling news stories , rich navigation and image slideshows were once solely the domain of Flash .
Widespread adoption of standards is easily attributable to the ease of using JavaScript libraries for enhanced interaction and current support of CSS among browsers .
Video has been an important step in moving Web standards forward .
Video is one of the few things that could once only be delivered in Flash .
The biggest leap so far has been YouTube ’s adoption of the HTML5 video element ( albeit in beta ) , allowing modern browsers to bypass the Flash plug - in and use video native to the browser ’s player .
HTML5 video has encountered controversy ( thanks to the current codec debacle ) and reports of unimpressive performance , but these issues will be worked out .
Website developers will implement HTML5 video and choose an appropriate codec .
When the biggest websites make this decision , we ’ll end up with a de facto standard that gives browsers improved performance .
Modern Browser Adoption
HTML5 and CSS3 represent a great effort to advance native browser performance , and many browser providers are already implementing their specifications , even through they have n’t been set in stone .
We have a lot to look forward to with CSS animation , canvas , local storage , geo-location and other specifications that will bring Web standards into a new era .
Although it will be many years before we see 100 % of the emerging specifications implemented in browsers and see a large majority of users upgrade to those browsers , if we embrace the progressive enhancement of content , we ’re well on our way to pushing adoption among developers .
Progressive Enhancement
Learning to produce progressively enhanced content , giving up pixel - perfect rendering in every browser , and embracing graceful degradation in older browsers can free up time to concentrate on other areas of development , such as accessibility and platform - delivery agnosticism .
( Image : Unobtrusify.com )
If users of your website do n’t have JavaScript or CSS enabled , they can still access and enjoy your content in a more limited way , unlike Flash websites , which typically do n’t deliver content in the absence of Flash or JavaScript .
Designing with progressive enhancement in mind and building from the ground up require designers and developers to think more about the infrastructure of a website , and this typically exposes the kinds of issues that arise when working from the top down ( i.e. designing a website and then considering the fall - back ) .
Smart Phone Browsers and Context Delivery
The mobile Web is still in its infancy and usually an afterthought in the design process , but standard - based designs can degrade as nicely on phones as they do on older desktop browsers .
In the absence of the Flash plug - in , a website can still deliver an exceptional experience without much extra effort ( which would be cumbersome with a Flash website ) .
Mobile Web browsing is increasing exponentially , and ignoring these users is unwise .
Web standards are the only option to deliver richer interactions in mobile browsers .
Content Management
Giving website owners and editors the ability to edit interactive content inside a content management system means not having to coordinate with Flash developers to create and maintain content outside of the system .
Many agencies have ditched Flash for WordPress - powered websites that use JavaScript to enhance the experience , allowing for quick and easy updates to portfolios and content .
Openness
Web standards being what they are ( i.e. standard agreement on the way code is constructed and served ) , user agents and scripts from outside a website can be written to access data directly from the HTML .
Search engines , microformats , feeds , translation and bookmarklets all work because of the open nature and consistency between the data .
( Image : Monica ’s Dad )
If we want the Web to be truly scalable and interconnected , then microformats and microdata and APIs for content might be just the answer .
Otherwise , we ’ll remain in the same position we were years ago when websites erected walls around their content .
Freedom
Many people believe that the technology behind the Internet should be open and not competitive as it has been in the past .
People should be free to consume and create information , without being tied down to the kind licensing restrictions and legalities seen with the likes of Flash , Silverlight and other corporately owned technologies .
Creating and delivering content with Web standards not only is the best technological solution but supports the freedom of an open Web .
Flash Does , And Will Continue To Do , Many Things Well
Just because Flash - driven websites are gradually disappearing does n’t mean that Flash will disappear altogether .
Too much content and infrastructure have been set up to magically vanish .
Without vast restructuring or realigning of organizations and processes , plenty of Flash developers will continue to be employed , and plenty of Flash advertising will be directed at those ready to ignore it .
We owe a lot to Flash for making the Web what it is today , and it deserves that credit .
Even though it showed less potential compared to the other plug - in technologies , such as Java applets , that emerged early on , it had a nice balance between seamless delivery to users and ease of development and deployment .
Many other Web technologies , such as VRML and SVG , have tried to overcome Flash ’s hold on the Web but have continually fallen short .
Where would the Internet be without Flash and the innovations it brought ?
Ease of Use
Out of the gate , Flash was intuitive and easy - to - use application for both designers and developers , delivering the simplest of animations , yet able to scale to serve complex applications .
( Image : ejk )
Because of its ease of use , Flash posed a lower barrier to entry for budding designers and developers .
And combined with the suite of applications from Adobe , Flash fits well in the designer ’s workflow .
Consistency
You ca n’t argue with the fact that for many years Flash has been the only way to deliver rich interaction in a consistent way across a wide range of platforms and browsers .
It ’s still the only way to deliver video and audio to older browsers , and it will retain its throne for several more years .
If you ’re a stickler for fonts and demand special ones for your website , then you ’ll be saddened by the current state of font support in the browser .
This shortcoming will have to be compensated by Flash and swfObject until @font - face and various font formats become more widely supported .
Standards Not Quite
There
As much as Web standards have advanced , we ’re often stuck having to support older browsers in which Flash may be the only way to deliver audio , video and complex data - heavy interfaces .
Thanks to early adopting Web browser providers , we can start using the HTML5 audio and video tag today .
But we still have to plan for a Flash fall - back to deliver media in older browsers .
The same could be said for the canvas element for delivering complex visualization , 3 - D animation and games .
If a browser like IE6 needs to be supported , providing a decent fall - back for the canvas element can be complicated .
Flash might just be the best choice for development in such cases .
As always , your current and potential audience should determine your direction .
Progressively Enhanced Flash and Flash Injection
The best Flash developers take the same approach as the Web standards crowd , using Flash as a layer to enhance their websites and applications .
If that continues , Flash will continue to have a place in delivering a great experience , serving mobile devices and reaching search engines and other user agent technologies .
The Flash injection technique is the easiest way to meld the best of both worlds .
The Future of Flash
Adobe has never been the type of company to let a product stagnate .
You can be sure it will keep pushing to get Flash on as many mobile devices as possible .
( Image : Robert Weißenberg )
With Creative Suite 5 , developers will be able to output Flash projects as native iPhone applications using the iPhone Packager .
And Flash could soon evolve from its early roots as an animation application to a full - fledged desktop and mobile application development environment with the help of AIR and related advancements ( AIR might reach the mobile space pretty quickly ) .
Flash developers will likely be in even greater demand , as the demand to deliver applications consistently between desktop and mobile devices increase — even if they are n’t asked to create run -of - the - mill websites .
Web standards and Flash ( and other plug - in technologies ) are simply tools to create content for the Web .
Even if Flash is on the decline for websites , Flash developers have no reason to worry about becoming obsolete .
Everything that is true for creating rich Internet applications holds true for whatever other tool you use , and transitioning to Web standards development may be easier than you think .
( Image : kansas_city_royalty )
Flash and Web standards developers have more in common than they do n’t .
Interface and interaction design , typography , layout , graphic design and object - oriented programming are all still valid and important for both technologies .
Developers on both sides of the spectrum struggle with many of the same issues .
They both set out to create a great user experience , to design intuitive interactions and to make websites easy for users .
All of this is done not by the technology itself but by the people behind it .

Secret order prepares new US wars in Middle East and Central Asia
By Hiram Lee
26 May 2010
A front - page article in Tuesday ’s New York Times reveals the existence of a secret directive signed by Gen. David Petraeus , chief of the US Central Command , ordering the expansion of covert military operations throughout the Middle East , Central Asia and the Horn of Africa .
The seven - page document , entitled “ Joint Unconventional Warfare Task Force Execute Order , ” essentially provides the US military with a blank check to carry out aggressive acts against virtually any country .
Issued in September 2009 , the order calls for the creation of a network of covert task forces and intelligence - gathering units which will “ penetrate , disrupt , defeat or destroy ” any target within any country designated by the US military .
These forces will carry out clandestine operations which “ cannot or will not be accomplished ” through other military means .
Once inside the targeted country , US forces will also “ prepare the environment ” for full - scale military assaults .
In addition to military personnel , the Times reports , Petraeus ’s order enlists “ foreign businesspeople , academics or others ” in “ persistent situational awareness ” efforts — in other words , in spying .
The US will target countries considered hostile as well as countries with which it has maintained friendly relations .
Among the countries cited by the Times as potential targets are Iran , Saudi Arabia and Somalia .
The Times also reports that the document “ appears to authorize specific operations in Iran , most likely to gather intelligence about the country ’s nuclear program or identify dissident groups that might be useful for a future military offensive . ”
While the Obama administration publicly indicates it will counter the supposed nuclear threat from Iran by calling for greater UN sanctions and trade embargoes , the Petraeus order clearly suggests that Obama has something far more sinister in mind .
The Times cites US officials who say the order “ also permits reconnaissance that could pave the way for possible military strikes in Iran if tensions over its nuclear ambitions escalate . ”
The secret order is already believed to have laid the groundwork for the US military ’s offensive in Yemen , which began in December 2009 .
US Special Forces troops entered that country to provide its military with training and join with them in attacking Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , said to be the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen .
President Obama ordered air strikes on alleged militant compounds in December that claimed the lives of dozens of civilians .
US Naval ships have also sent missiles raining down on the country .
The Times acknowledges that it agreed to withhold information contained in the Petraeus document , a copy of which the newspaper says it viewed .
Citing “ concerns about troop safety raised by an official at United States Central Command , ” the newspaper reports that it agreed to suppress details on troop deployments .
Thus the liberal “ paper of record ” does its part to further the aggressive designs of the US military and keep the American people in the dark about the most vital details of the covert operations .
While the Times does not say so , the covert operations order , which goes beyond similar directives under the Bush administration , could not have been issued without the approval of President Obama .
This underscores the fact that the Obama administration is continuing and expanding the policies of militarism and war carried out under Bush , and preparing to extend US military aggression well beyond the confines of Iraq and Afghanistan .
The use of military special operations forces as intelligence operatives throughout the Middle East and Central Asia allows the administration to place spy operations under the jurisdiction of the US Central Command and General Petraeus .
In contrast to the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency , the military ’s covert spy operations will not by law require presidential approval or be subject to congressional oversight .
7 - Eleven to sell private - label beer
( Fortune ) --
The battle over shelf space in the beer industry is about to heat up with the entrance of a new brand to the refrigerators at 7 - Eleven .
And it 's the nearly 6,000 - strong convenience store chain that is making the private label brew , called " Game Day . "
While big brewers like Anheuser - Busch InBev can usually muscle their way into premium spots , this time around the newbie could give them a run for their money since it can hand - pick prime cooler real - estate to showcase its beer .
7 - Eleven might not know a lot about brewing -- it 's reportedly leaving that to City Brewing in LaCrosse , Wisconsin -- but it does know beer , given that a huge chunk of industry sales take place at convenience stores .
The company confirmed that the new product is a premium beer selling at a budget price but would n't provide further details .
Unfortunately for chains like 7 - Eleven , their prime demographic , the key beer - drinking crowd , has been the segment hit among the hardest by the recession , says Beer Marketer 's Insights president Benj Steinman .
Think male , age 21 to 27 , blue - collar workers , and then think about the decline of industrial jobs .
Convenience store beer buys dropped 4 % in 2009 , according to research firm SymphonyIRI , a steeper decline than seen in other outlets .
But sales of below - premium beers have held up and have even seen a slight lift .
Core convenience store shoppers now have less cash , which is likely why 7 - Eleven is entering the market at a low price point .
" They figure that since brands are weaker at that price segment they can capture the full margin rather than pay a premium to a supplier , " says Harry Schuhmacher with Beer Business Daily , which first reported the news .
Schuhmacher says the beer is called Game Day , but 7 - Eleven would n't confirm .
7 - Eleven has a history of dabbling in this arena .
Remember Santiago ?
( You probably do n't . )
The chain launched the brew in 2003 to get a piece of the imported beer craze , but like a lot of private beer labels struggled to get a foothold in the market .
" High - end no - name beer is a loser proposition , " says Schuhmacher .
" Why pay more for a beer nobody 's ever heard of ? "
Even this time around at a budget price Schuhmacher is n't convinced it will take off .
Private labels work for soft drinks , but in the beer world brands still matter .
Even at the low - end of the spectrum , consumers often show fierce loyalty to a single label .
The move is one that 7 - Eleven has hinted at before .
In January amid recent beer price hikes 7 - Eleven spokesperson Margaret Chabris told the Wall Street Journal , " We need cost decreases or we think there will be declines in domestic purchases in total , " and that the company is " exploring alternative strategies to better satisfy our customers . "
Another advantage for the chain is the chance to further push its private label .
Consumers have signaled that they 're willing to buy products packaged under store brands , which gives supermarkets and convenience stores better margins .
It 's not a passing trend spurred by the downturn , says NPD Group 's chief industry analyst Harry Balzer .
He 's found that between 1984 and 2002 of all the products you consumed , 20 % were store - brand products .
That 's now climbed to 27 % .
The launch also allows 7 - Eleven more control in how it transports its beer to stores .
It will deliver the beer through normal channels in all markets except southern and northern California , the company said , where they 'll use combined distribution centers .
These centers bring together goods from multiple suppliers in order to trim the number of deliveries to stores .
" 7 - Eleven 's issue is that there are a lot of trucks in their parking lot keeping consumers out , " Schuhmacher says . ( see editor 's note )
Though the beer 's name sounds targeted to appeal sports fans , it seems to have a double message :
It 's about to be ' game day ' for 7 - Eleven and the recently consolidated beer industry as well .
Game on .
Correction :
An earlier version of this story stated that the company unsuccessfully tested centralized beer distribution in the Los Angeles area last year .
7 - Eleven contacted Fortune and said it has n't yet started the pilot test .
Runaway Ohio Mom Tiffany Tehan Likely to Go Unpunished
After massive manhunt , cops say missing Tiffany Tehan just wanted " a new life . "
April 23 , 2010  --
The Ohio mother who sparked a nationwide manhunt when she ran away from home with another man is unlikely to face criminal charges , a family law expert said today .
" You have to say , ' What 's the crime ? ' " family law attorney Michael Kretzmer told " Good Morning America " today .
" [ There 's ] no question that deception was involved , but I think that 's going to be something that law enforcement 's going to have a tough time , really , proving there was a crime . "
Tiffany Tehan , 31 , disappeared Saturday , leaving behind husband David and 1 - year - old daughter Lexie .
The vanishing act triggered a cross-country search until police , acting on an FBI tip , found her staying at a Miami Beach motel with Tre Hutcherson , a man police had called a person of interest in her disappearance .
Police quickly determined that Tehan was not in danger .
" She left voluntarily with this fellow and drove to Miami to -- and these are her words -- start a new life , " Miami Beach police Sgt. Wayne Jones said .
Kretzmer said it 's possible but unlikely that Tehan will face misdemeanor charges for inciting a panic .
" I think from a practical standpoint , you have to consider whether the state has a substantial interest in going after these people , " he said .
" You want to discourage this kind of activity and there should be some culpability for all that occurred .
But again , no crime . "
No charges have been filed against Tehan or Hutcherson and Miami police said it appears no one broke any laws .
Capt .
Scott Anger of Ohio's Xenia Police Division Thursday called the incident a " personal , family matter . "
Husband Forgives Wife Immediately
David Tehan said Thursday he was angry at Hutcherson but that he " absolutely " forgives his wife .
When asked why he forgave her , Tehan said , " I do n't know .
It 's supernatural .
" She may have made some mistakes but everyone does and I can't blame her for any of this , " the husband said .
" She 's a person like anyone else getting through life , and it 's not always easy . "
Tehan said he wants his wife to come home and work out the problems in their marriage .
" There may be issues to work out , but that 's OK , " he said .
" Issues we can work out . "
During a phone call with his wife after she was discovered , she asked about Lexie and " told us she missed us , " David Tehan said .
He said they had been so busy that he did n't suspect anything was wrong .
Tehan 's father , Chuck Tabor , became emotional when he heard that his daughter was found unharmed Wednesday night .
" Just to know my little girl is safe is all I needed , " Tabor said through tears at a news conference Thursday .
Husband of Runaway Wife Didn't Suspect Marital Problems
Ever since surveillance footage of Tehan surfaced with Hutcherson on Tuesday , police considered the possibility Tehan was a runaway and not in danger .
Tehan told police she intends to return to Ohio but it is unclear when , Miami police Sgt. Wayne Jones said .
David Tehan told " Good Morning America " Wednesday the couple was not having marital problems .
" It just seems so completely out of character .
I just ca n't understand or believe it , " he said .
Before Tehan was discovered in Miami Beach , her friends said she would never have just left her daughter .
" We 're trying to leave the details and the speculation to the police , " Tracy Staley said earlier this week .
" That mother - child bond is unlike anything else . "
David Tehan said Wednesday their daughter is " coping as well as can be expected , " considering how her life has been disrupted since his wife 's disappearance .
" If there 's anything I could say to Tiffany , " he said before she was found , " it would just be that I love you , I miss you and I can't wait to see you again . "
Police released images Tuesday taken from a surveillance camera at a convenience store showing Tehan and a bearded man , later identified as Hutcherson .
Police say Tehan and the man regularly visited the store together in recent weeks , but her friends and family did not recognize him .
Tehan 's husband had last heard from his wife around 11 a.m.
Saturday , while she made the rounds at garage sales looking for inexpensive clothing for their daughter .

Can a “ green ” credit card help save the planet ?
That ’s a tall order for a slim slice of wallet real estate that ’s better suited to shim up a wobbly table or free a stubborn latch than to patch holes in the ozone layer .
And yet , for all sorts of symbolic reasons , a green credit card might indeed help spring mankind out of the carbonic hothouse of our own devising , if only by prompting those who produce and issue credit , debit , gift , access and identification cards to minimize the environmental impact of their actions .
A 2010 green banking study by Javelin Strategy & Research found that the importance of environmental issues has grown to where financial institutions can realize a “ green dividend ” with customers by offering such earth - friendly programs as paperless account statements .
The green movement has heightened public awareness of the toxins and poisons in our midst through targeted public events such as Earth Day .
While it ’s hard to find outright opponents to clean air , water and farmland , it can be complicated to find earth - friendly solutions that work for both business and consumers .
( See “ 5 earth - friendly credit card moves you can make now “ )
A case in point : credit cards .
6 billion cards a year
Roughly 6 billion credit cards are produced each year by card manufacturers worldwide , according to the International Card Manufacturers Association ( ICMA ) .
The vast majority of them contain a remarkably cheap form of plastic called polyvinyl chloride , or PVC .
Forty years ago , when engineering standards were being written around the handy new plastic charge cards , they reflected properties inherent in PVC , which was the only stuff stiff enough to survive years of transactions in the old zip - zap knuckle - busting manual terminals , yet flexible enough not to split or break in your wallet .
In fact , PVC was something of a wonder - stuff that , when softened with plasticizers , became ubiquitous in everything from clothing and hosiery to plumbing and pool toys .
Small problem : PVC does not biodegrade , meaning it is forever - stuff .
It emits greenhouse gases when burned , and its underlying material ( vinyl chloride ) and additives have been linked to health risks .
It would be hard to find a less earth - friendly substance than PVC .
Few would defend it if presented with an earth - friendly alternative .
Greenpeace has called for a worldwide ban on it .
Just one problem : “ Of all the material that falls within that characteristics window , PVC is really the only commodity available , ” says Brad Paulson of Thor Engineering , who is searching for alternatives as a member of the ICMA ’s Green Task Force .
“ There are plenty of other plastics , plenty of other materials , but they become cost - prohibitive very quickly . ”
Corn chip card , anyone ?
So the search goes on for a green alternative .
The pursuit of a cleaner card substrate has produced some interesting contenders , most of which have fallen short of the International Organization for Standards for durability and functionality across a wide range of card terminals that in turn were designed around tolerances inherent in PVC .
Wood has been tried , with limited success .
“ It ’s difficult to come up with wood that is flexible enough to not split when you put it in your wallet , and it ’s hard to get a smooth - enough finish on it to affix a magnetic stripe , ” says Paulson .
“ It can be done , but it ’s expensive . ”
Early charge plates were made of metal ; why not go back to those ?
“ Metal has its own problems because it ’s conductive , ” Paulson says .
“ I frankly think it ’s a bad idea to put metal into a piece of electronic equipment .
That ’s something we frown on here in the lab . ”
The latest contender is polylactic acid , or PLA , a bio - based polymer derived from corn , which entered the scene in the 1990s .
Last November , three Japanese companies , Mitsubishi Plastic , Dai Nippon Printing and Sony Corporation , announced the development of the first bio - based integrated - chip credit card approved for use by MasterCard Worldwide .
While Paulson admits that PLA blends are improving , he questions whether it will hold up under constant use .
Cards that do n’t survive to their expiration date are not only expensive to replace , they also double their carbon footprint in paperwork , mailing and transportation emissions , defeating the intended benefit to the environment .
“ The fact that it ’s biodegradable means that as soon as it is built , it begins biodegrading .
Card users expect that card to work regularly , easily , every time they go to the gas station .
The more things you do that promote degradation , the harder it ’s going to be to have them survive that term , ” Paulson says .
“ Plus , when a fair portion of the world is starving , how responsible is it to take a food crop and turn it into plastic ? ”
Plastic or paper ?
Point taken .
So , what about our old friend paper ?
It ’s nothing if not earth - friendly , and we already recycle it .
Ca n’t we get paper to , uh , paper - up for card use ?
Actually , yes , says Mark Dillon , vice president with Meyers Printing Company , a Minneapolis - based label maker that recently received a patent on its Greencard , a paper card with the look , feel and functionality of plastic .
“ Our card is perfect for activation cards , download cards , gift cards , ” says Dillon .
“ We ’ve produced them with bar codes , mag stripes , foil , holograms and embossing .
It will perform in virtually every application just like a plastic card . ”
Dillon says his Greencard is competitive with PVC in price and beats PLA in preprint waste .
As for recycling , you can put it at the curb , throw it in the garbage or light your barbecue with it without stressing Mother Nature .
So will your credit card company soon be offering you that check stand choice of plastic or paper ?
Uh , no .
“ If it gets wet , it ’s going to absorb water , ” Dillon says .
“ It will stand up in your wallet for months and months , but it wo n’t go through the wash and come out looking good . ”
What about recycling cards ?
Paulson says that even if the carbon footprint to collect and ship used cards back made sense ( it does n’t ) , recycled PVC still does n’t cut it as new - card stock .
“ Just as people are resistant to recycled paper because you do n’t get that true white that makes your letterhead look nice , cards are the same way .
You print on them , and if you do n’t get a consistent color underneath , it ’s difficult to get that color to look right , which means your customers are n’t going to like it either . ”
Good intentions and ‘ greenwashing ’
While the search for a green alternative to the PVC credit card continues , the collateral benefits of the green initiative are already working their way into an industry that has been rolling out plastic cards the same way for half a century .
Al Vrancart , ICMA co-founder and Green Task Force adviser , says many major credit card issuers want to meet consumer demands for a green card , but they fear being perceived as “ greenwashing ” — falsely claiming environmental benefits — when new substrate products prove too costly to implement .
“ That ’s the struggle that we have ; everybody wants to base it on just that little card itself that resides in our wallet , ” he says .
“ Unfortunately , you sometimes get labeled a ‘ greenwasher ’ because you want to save money .
You should be doing it first of all because it ’s the right thing to do as a person on the planet .
You want to do the right thing in building something that is sustainable and is going to make the customers happy .
Customer delight is everything . ”
The Green Task Force , which is working to develop green industry standards , will likely introduce specs to encourage manufacturers to recycle and reduce waste , water , energy and material consumption long before it solves the alternative substrate conundrum .
Paulson says that ’s where the task force can do the most good .
“ I think credit cards are just an easy mark .
A lot of this is driven by public perception and PVC has a bad reputation , so what ’s easier than mandating that we not use PVC ? ” he says .
“ But no one is storming Home Depot about the PVC in our pipes .
And no one wants to go back to lead pipes either . ”
“ There is n’t a danger like Toyota in this ; it ’s a public perception .
But the silver lining may be that it cleans up some manufacturing processes and moves the ball forward a little to encourage recycling . ”

HC Summit : Blue Dog rep , but NO Progressive , Hispanic , Black , Asian rep. invited .
3 women of 29 members invited .
Call WH & complain loudly .
The four additional members invited by House Democratic leaders , however , includes Rep. Xavier Becerra ( D - Calif. ) , a member of the CPC and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus .

In January thousands marched to express anger over corruption Indonesia 's justice minister has opened the country 's first prison wing for people convicted of corruption .
The wing , which is part of Cipinang Penitentiary in East Jakarta , can house up to 256 inmates convicted of graft .
It was built after it emerged that many officials jailed for corruption were living relatively luxurious lives behind bars .
The facility already has 10 inmates , the Jakarta Globe said , including an ex-minister and a former lawmaker .
Sixteen single cells would hold aged or ailing inmates , the prison 's architect said , with other inmates sharing 48 cells , each housing up to five people .
' Nothing special ' Justice Minister Patrialis Akbar told the BBC that the wing was needed to separate corruption convicts from petty criminals , and would reduce overcrowding in Indonesia 's prisons .
" It is obvious we can not put them in the same place with those who committed murder or petty theft , " he said .
" These so - called corruptors have in the past done so many good things for this country .
They include professors , doctors , ex-government ministers , surely we can not put them with the other criminals ?
" In fact we still need many of their brains to make this country better .
Prison should be a correctional institution , not a vengeance institution , " he said .
But he emphasised that the inmates would not be getting better treatment .
" There is nothing special nor any special facilities with this prison .
It is just that we separate them from the criminal prison .
There is no air - conditioner , not even fans , nor television .
The mattresses are as thin as other prisons . "
Indonesia is often ranked as one of the most corrupt countries in the world - something that extends to the prison system , where wealthy prisoners can secure better conditions .
In January an inspection of one prison found that a businesswoman jailed for five years for bribery was living in a large , carpeted single cell equipped with comfortable furniture , a fridge and a flat - screen television .
That same month thousands of Indonesians took to the streets of Jakarta to protest against corruption , and in particular against the arrest of two officials from the powerful anti-corruption commission .
Many Indonesians saw the arrests as an attempt to unfairly target one of the few institutions people think of as credible .

As the prevalence of dementia continues to rise , a recent study has demonstrated that a common food may have a role to play in the prevention and treatment of the condition .
A recent study published in thehas shown that blueberries had a measurable improvement in learning and world list recall , which backs up a 2008 study with the same conclusions .
Dr Krikorian recruited nine elderly subjects with an average age of 76.2 and gave them a daily dose of wild blueberry juice ; the subjects received between 6 and 9ml per kilo of bodyweight , which would equate to around 525 ml per day in the average 70 kg / 155 lb man .
The memory improvements were compared to the performance of a separate demographically - matched group who consumed a placebo drink , ruling out any doubt that the observed changes in memory were attributable to practice effects .
" Because blueberries are high in antioxidants , which have beneficial health effects , they are being examined in many research projects , " said Donal O'Mathuna after looking at the study results .
" Blueberries are a nutritious and safe food ... adding blueberries to a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is warranted .
" What was particularly interesting was the effect the blueberry juice had in lowering both depressive symptoms and glucose levels in the blood .
Whether a reduced level of insulin was related to the impressive results in mental function are not yet clear , but the study strongly supports the idea that flavonoids such as anthocyanins , previously thought to function as purely an antioxidant in the human body , have wide - reaching effects in human health .
In 2008 , researchers at the University of Reading found that the anthocyanins in blueberries activate the part of the brain that controls memory and learning .
At the time , Dr Jeremy Spencer commented : " Scientists have known of the potential health benefits of diets rich in fresh fruits for a long time .
Our research provides scientific evidence to show that blueberries are good for you and supports the idea that a diet - based approach could potentially be used to increase memory capacity .
We will be taking these findings to the next level by investigating the effects of diets rich in flavonoids on individuals suffering from cognitive impairment and possibly Alzheimer 's disease .
" Despite the failure of mainstream medicine in dealing with dementia , it may be too much to hope for that doctors will agree with Spencer 's view and adopt a dietary approach in the management of these problematic conditions .
Meanwhile , those keen to prevent cognitive decline , or to help manage the condition in others , may take heart from the confirmation that healthy foods may do more than simply keep their waistline in check .

A long - lost Soviet solar / nuclear robot buggy - mislaid in the early 1970s - has been found on the moon by a NASA survey satellite .
Old school .
The vehicle in question is the Lunokhod 1 rover , which landed in the Mare Imbrium aboard the Luna 17 lander in 1970 .
During the fortnight - long lunar days the machine was able to prowl about on electric drive , topping up its batteries using the fliptop solar panel mounted above its tub - like main body .
During the long , chilly nights the lid would shut and the systems inside the tub were kept alive by a Polonium - 210 radioisotope powered heater .
Lunokhod 1 stayed in touch with Soviet ground controllers for no less than 11 months , prowling the moon even as the US astronauts of Apollo 14 and 15 were driving about elsewhere in their manned moon buggies .
However the robot crawler eventually ceased communications , and the project was officially terminated on October 4 , 1971 .
Damn it Sergey , stop driving round and round the bloody lander and get going .
The Lunokhod carried a French - made reflector unit , intended to help with measurements of the moon and its orbit , which should have meant that the defunct rover could be easily located from Earth .
However the Soviet operators had only a sketchy notion where their craft actually was at any given time and in fact since Lunokhod 1 went off - line nobody has known exactly where it finished up .
( The Russians went so far as to cadge US Apollo photos of the moon 's surface for the subsequent Lunokhod 2 mission . )
The reflector does n't perform well enough for Earthly astronomers to pick up sunlight from it , and the alternative technique - beaming a laser from Earth at the rover and looking for the reflected light - requires that one have a fairly close idea where it is in order to aim the laser .
A team of boffins in California , whose research involves measuring the Moon 's orbit with extreme precision in order to test Einstein 's theory of general relativity , have long made use of other lunar reflectors left by the Apollo programme .
" We yearned to find Lunokhod - 1 , " says Professor Tom Murphy , head of the moon - gazer team .
" It would provide the best leverage for understanding the liquid lunar core , and for producing an accurate estimate of the position of the center of the moon — which is of paramount importance in mapping out the orbit and putting Einstein ’s gravity to a test , " he adds .

Mr. Smith estimates by eye the proper distance of his sets from their outdoor backdrops .
“ It ’s all by trial and error , ” he said , “ moving a set around , watching how shadows fall . ”
He spends about an hour on each shoot , which usually produces two or three usable photos .
( He has done about 200 shoots . )
Mr. Smith describes his photos as stories .
Each is a self - contained miniature play , a window into his memories and imagination .
A nondescript edifice that he noticed while scouting locations became the “ Research Building . ”
The 1958 Chrysler model he photographed in the nearby “ parking lot ” might belong to the head of a space program project .
That executive is nowhere to be seen .
Elgin Park is full of shiny American cars from the ’ 40s to the mid-’60s , but there ’s not a driver or pedestrian in sight .
The omission is deliberate .
“ I do n’t put people in my photos , ” Mr. Smith said .
“ I want viewers to put themselves into the scenes .
I ’m creating a mood , something familiar in the viewer ’s mind . ”
While no people are visible in the photos , he has managed to give Elgin Park a sense of humanity , as if at any moment someone will step out of a store and drive away in a car .
The more ways he rearranged his sets , and the more photos he posted on Flickr , the more Mr. Smith could feel a town was emerging .
“ One day , it just hit me : this is ‘ Elgin Park , ’ ” he said .
“ I did n’t know where that came from . ”
Driving Mr. Smith ’s creation of Elgin Park were his memories of Sewickley , Pa. , a real steel - mill town a few miles north of Pittsburgh .
He spent his first 17 years there , and it still holds his heart .
“ Elgin Park is not an exact re-creation of Sewickley , ” he explained , “ but it does capture the mood of my memories . ”
Last week when we suggested the Marlins have Scott Stapp re-work a Creed song for the team , we were just kidding .
Turns out the Marlins were serious .
Scott Stapp , overly so .
Have you ever seen anyone so clenched and angry - looking about an imminent World Series championship ( as the song says ) ?
Yep , that 's what 's going to play on the scoreboard at home games , and it plays amazingly like an SNL parody .
To be fair , it 's hard for anyone to remain dignified when singing about baseball , but may we suggest the following , more realistic lyrics :
Let 's play ball it 's game day
If you 're too good , the Fish 'll trade you away
Take the field , hear the roar of a grand
' Cause there 's no one in the stands
' Cause there 's no one in the stands
Keep Hanley Ramirez and you may see a score
With Dan Uggla untraded you might see more
One strike two strikes swing away
This just ai n't Chris Coghlan 's day
So many guys stranded on base
Another bullpen fright , we 're either
World Series Champs , or having a bad night !
We 've only made the post - season twiiiiiiice !
When Jeffrey fires Fredi it wo n't !
be! niiiiiiiice !
Or something , anyway , that does n't sound as if believing in ourselves with a dash of nu-rock makes up for that bullpen .
Naturally , the team is no stranger to questionable seasonal stylings ; flailing dorky promotion is part of their considerable charm .
But at least Pitbull had the good sense to use a Debbie Deb sample , and even Shoe Gallery 's opening day short is more inspiring -- if only for that giant turkey leg -- and it 's trying to sell us something .
Marlins Die-Hards is so horrified by the Stapping they 've suggested rolling footage of actual marlins eating sardines instead .
This is , of course , the correct answer .

James Murdoch : The next Tony Soprano .
" What are you fucking playing at ? "
Those were reportedly the opening words from Rupert Murdoch 's son James Murdoch to The Independent editor in chief Simon Kelner .
The young chairman and CEO of News Corporation Europe and Asia stormed into the rival newspaper 's newsroom yesterday after the UK paper printed a series of promotional ads telling readers : " Rupert Murdoch wo n't decide this election .
You will . "
The FT reports that Murdoch arrived with a small entourage behind him , including Rebekah Brooks , CEO of News International .
She publishes News Corp 's The Times and The Sun .
A copy of the newly redesigned Independent was in Murdoch 's hands .
Witnesses described the scene to the Guardian as if James was hunting for his mafia hit .
" It was so bizarre .
He came in all menace .
You know the sort of thing : ' The boss has heard what you have been saying about him .
He does n't like it . ' "
After the editors had heated conversations in Kelner 's office for 20 minutes , Murdoch left the scene in a huff , according to reports .
Both The Sun and News of the World are supporting David Cameron , the Conservative party candidate for prime minister .
As Newser 's Micheal Wolff reminds us , Rupert is fiercely protective of his tabloids ' influence in elections .
From Newser :
One of the most famous headlines of his career appeared in the Sun after the Conservative victory in Britain 1992 : “ It 's The Sun Wot Won It . ”
Murdoch is still stewing over an ill - timed and inept endorsement of John McCain over Barack Obama ( again , against his better judgment — Murdoch likes Obama and was convinced to back McCain by Roger Ailes and New York Post editor Col Allen ) .
James does n't want another John McCain incident .
Although he is power grabbing News Corp. from his dad , he wants to please him .
He also wants to win , a characteristic that runs in Murdoch blood .
We wonder how James would be reacting to all this New York Times vs. Wall Street Journal hubbub if ( / when ) he takes over News Corp. from Rupert .
A legal charity has named two men who ended up in the infamous " dark prison " at Bagram in Afghanistan after being handed to US forces by members of the SAS .
The men were held in Afghanistan after being seized by the British in Iraq .
The charity Reprieve said it was suing the Ministry of Defence for refusing officially to identify the men , who are from Pakistan .
The MoD argues that if it released their names , even to their families , it would be in breach of the Data Protection Act .
The director of Reprieve , Clive Stafford Smith , accused the ministry of " rank hypocrisy " for refusing to give the prisoners their rights while at the same time claiming it was upholding the rule of law .
David Davis , the former Conservative shadow home secretary , who has also taken up the case , described the ministry 's refusal to release the names as an " insult " .
" If they are bad people , tell us who they are .
I think the reason we are not being told is because it is politically embarrassing .
They deserve a trial .
We deserve to know what the truth is . "
Reprieve said it had taken years and thousands of pounds to discover the identities of the two men who were taken by the SAS in Iraq in 2004 .
It named them today as Amanatullah Ali , a Shia , and Yunus Rahmatullah , a Sunni .
It said Rahmatullah , who is also known as Saleh , is being held in the mental health wing of Bagram and has been unable to contact his family or a lawyer and was in a " legal black hole " .
The British legal aid system will not allow his family to bring a case because there is insufficient proof Saleh was the prisoner rendered to Afghanistan , though only the British government had proof , Reprieve said .
The charity released a statement from Rahmatullah 's mother , Fatima , in which she said : " As a mother , this is a position that I struggle to understand .
My plea to the British government is simple : tell me whether you picked my son Yunus up and gave him to the Americans . "
John Hutton , the defence secretary at the time , admitted to the Commons a year ago that British officials knew about the transfer of the prisoners in 2004 , although the government had previously denied having any knowledge of the case .
He said they were members of Lashkar - e - Taiba , ( LeT ) a banned organisation that he said was linked to al - Qaida .
The US had assured him that the men were being held in humane conditions and had access to the Red Cross .
Hutton added that the US had taken the prisoners to Afghanistan because of a " lack of relevant linguists necessary to interrogate them effectively in Iraq " .
In a letter to Jack Straw , the justice secretary , released today , Stafford Smith says on a recent visit to Pakistan that he received evidence that Amanatullah , a rice farmer , could not be a member of LeT , a Sunni extremist group .
In his statement last year , Hutton referred to allegations first made in 2008 by Ben Griffin , a former SAS soldier , that British troops had handed over to the US detainees who were then rendered to Iraq .
The MoD subsequently obtained a gagging order preventing Griffin from saying anything further .
Davis said he would be surprised if an incoming Conservative government did not set up an immediate inquiry into this case and others where Britain is alleged to have been involved in the secret rendering by the US of detainees to prison where they were likely to be tortured .
The MoD had threatened it would seek to impose costs if Reprieve took legal action against it , a move designed to intimidate , said Stafford Smith .
" The government may think that bully - boy tactics will intimidate us .
In truth , they merely steel our resolve , " he said .
An MoD spokesman described the two men as " insurgents captured in Baghdad as they posed an imperative threat to security of the Iraqi people and our armed forces " .
He added : " Reprieve were seeking an assurance that the MoD would not pursue them for costs if they lost , but were clear that no reciprocal assurance would be provided .
The MoD has therefore declined to give them this assurance . "

In Defense of Sedition
America ’s conservative movement , writes Sara Robinson , is engaged in “ sedition in slow motion , a gradual corrosive undermining of the government ’s authority and capacity to run the country . ”
If only it were so !
Alas , even using Robinson ’s preferred definition ( “ Crime of creating a revolt , disturbance , or violence against lawful civil authority with the intent to cause its overthrow or destruction ” — Britannica Concise Dictionary ) , she ’s not even close .
If anything , America ’s right - wing statists have a better claim to support of “ lawful civil authority ” — the US Constitution , which they frequently invoke and at least occasionally recognize as authoritative — than left - wing statists of Robinson ’s ilk , who ignore or mock it whenever it stands between them and their latest plot against human liberty .
What I really take issue with , though , is not Robinson ’s mistaken contention that the specter of sedition haunts North America , hovering over assorted Tea Party gatherings , militia musters and talk radio rants .
My problem with Robinson is that she thinks sedition is a bad thing .
Does the following ring any bells ?
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . —
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
In 20/20 hindsight , the authors of the Declaration of Independence ( a “ Committee of Five ” — John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Jefferson , Robert Livingston and Roger Sherman — appointed by the Second Continental Congress ) invited the calamity that is our current situation by misunderstanding or misstating the purpose of government .
That purpose , of course , is not to “ secure rights ” for all , but to transfer wealth and power from the productive class to the political class .
The Committee ’s failure on that count is , to my mind , forgivable for two reasons .
First , the Declaration represented a giant step forward for its time .
It preceded ( by half a century or so ) , presaged , and to at least some degree inspired , the 19th - century development of anarchist theory which made the failure clear .
Secondly , it made clear that the hypothetical “ legitimacy ” of any government which resulted from action on its claims must rest firmly on a basis of … you guessed it … sedition … “ the Right of the People to alter or to abolish ” the “ lawful civil authority . ”
No sedition , no revolution .
No revolution , no United States of America .
No United States of America , no Sara Robinson choking on her outrage at the temerity of those uppity serfs who dare propose limits on the powers and prerogatives of a government already orders of magnitude larger and more oppressive than the one thrown off by the seditious conspiracy of 1776 .
Later in life , Jefferson ( the Declaration ’s primary author ) felt his way cautiously and haltingly toward anarchism .
It ’s my belief that , had he lived to write a second such declaration in , say , 1850 or so , the relevant passage might have read something like this :
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . —
That whenever any Form of Government becomes disrespectful of these rights , as all forms of Government inevitably must , it is the Right of the People to abolish it , and to dispense with Government altogether , freeing themselves to effect their Safety and Happiness .
The outfit Robinson writes for styles itself the “ Campaign for America ’s Future . ”
If America has a future worth fighting for , that future is to be discovered in and from a healthy respect for the good old - fashioned sedition of America ’s past .
We are a non-denominational human rights organisation , drawing support from a large cross-section of Irish society .
We promote pro-life education and defend human life at all stages , from conception to natural death .
We also campaigns for resources to support and assist pregnant women and those in need of healing after abortion .
There are some who would invert the great scale of history and praise selfishness while damning altruism .
" You may disdain self - interest , " the armchair individualist reasons , " but history 's great atrocities were caused not by treasure hunters but by the generosity of the leader 's great hordes .
After all , what selfish man would throw himself into battle after battle in the name of collective greatness ?
We should shun the giving man , for if man were pure and selfish , there would be no great wars . "
Inevitably , the libertarian pontificates on the virtues of selfishness and the evils of altruism .
It seems natural , then , to extend this simple calculus to the behavior of organizations , to criticize the generosity and kindness of governments and other corporate entities .
Except one could not , not because their kindness is beyond reproach , but because on the whole , a sane man could not describe their behavior as selfless .
In creating a collective whole , you do not abolish the self .
Rather , you create an entity that has a capacity for selfishness that far outstrips that of any human being .
It is not the absence of self , it is the birth of a greater , more malevolent self .
So in the philosophical sense , the great evil is still , quite intuitively , the privileging of the self over the whole .
I ’m going to talk about how to fit an NTE5 compatible ADSL filtered faceplate to your BT master socket .
This will allow you to plug your broadband modem router directly into the BT master line box , rather than having to use an ADSL micro filter .
Broadband reliability problems
I ’ve previously written about some of my broadband problem in my post about understanding signal to noise ratios , and my post about finding the best WiFi channel with Vistumbler .
These did n’t solve my problems so I decided to buy an ADSL faceplate which fits directly onto the BT master socket .
By removing the need for a separate ADSL micro filter the theory is that the broadband signal quality will be improved .
Buying a new NTE5 ADSL faceplate
I ordered the ADSL faceplate from this link on Amazon , and a few days later it arrived .
This is what is in the package :
The NTE5 compatible ADSL faceplate .
2 screws .
2 cable ties .
An instruction leaflet from BT explaining how to fit the faceplate , and how to re-wire any telephone extension cabling you have .
A piece of paper with some supplementary information .
Here is a close up of the rear of the ADSL faceplate .
You can see the plug that will go into the BT test socket on the left , and the connector for any extension cabling is the blue section in the middle .
Fitting the ADSL faceplate
The first thing I had to do was to get the bottom plate off the BT line box .
As a previous resident had painted the line box I had to use a Stanley knife to cut the paint .
I then used a small screw driver to remove the two screws .
This photo shows the bottom plate partially removed from the line box .
I do n’t have any extension telephone wiring , but if you do it will be attached to this bottom plate , so you ’ll have to take care when pulling the bottom plate out .
Plugging in the NTE5 ADSL faceplate filter is very simple .
You can see how the plug on the new faceplate lines up with the test socket in the BT line box .
After it is plugged in , your master socket will look like this with a connection for your phone , and a separate connection for the ADSL cable .
This ADSL faceplate is designed to be the correct size so it blends in with the BT line box .
There is a minor problem with the supplied screws .
They need to be longer than the original ones as the new faceplate adds width to the BT line box .
But the new screws have a thread size that is completely different to the original screws .
You can screw them in , but that will damage the original thread of the line box meaning you wo n’t be able to properly put the original screws back in if you wanted to go back to using the original faceplate .
For this reason I ’ve not screwed the new faceplate in yet .
ADSL faceplate review
I ’ve been using this ADSL faceplate filter for over a week now .
I was impressed with the speed of delivery after ordering from Amazon .
It was very easy to install , but I think they should supply screws that match the thread size from the original BT line box .
Before installing the faceplate my signal to noise ratio was an average of 8.6dB / 27dB ( downstream / upstream ) .
After installing the faceplate the signal to noise ratio was still an average of 8.6dB / 27dB .
So it made no difference to the signal to noise ratio .
I therefore think that my low downstream signal to noise ratio is not related to my original faceplate or my original ADSL filter .
However I do believe that it has reduced the frequency of dropped internet connections .
I ca n’t give any definite measurements to support this , but I do feel like I ’m resetting my modem router less often now .
In terms of appearance it does look better with the new ADSL faceplate as opposed to having my original BT faceplate with the ADSL microfilter sticking out of it .
Do I recommend it ?
Yes – but it is n’t essential .
I do n’t think it will perform miracles , but it may improve the quality of your connection , and it will make your BT line box look more modern , tidy , and up to date .
You can buy this ADSL faceplate direct from Amazon .

ORLANDO , Fla . –
As the nation ’s union leaders gather here for a meeting of the AFL - CIO executive council , the federation ’s executive vice president , Arlene Holt Baker , scoffed at media reports that unions have lower expectations now than they did when Barack Obama was elected president .
“ Why should we have lower expectations ? ” she asked .
“ His election was a big victory for working families and it remains a major reason we can and will fight like hell for all the thing American workers need – starting with jobs .
Interviewed here this weekend , Holt Baker said , “ There are more than 15 million unemployed in need of jobs .
This is why we have a five - point jobs program to create massive numbers of public service jobs , infrastructure jobs and extensions of unemployment and COBRA benefits .
We will plan this week how this fight will be taken forward and we will not lower our expectations , because the American people are not lowering their expectations .
They expect jobs and they expect health care . ”
The labor movement is aware that the changes are nor coming “ as fast as we would like ” but that this is due to “ the intransigence of powerful forces arrayed against us , ” she said .
“ The American people have taken these forces on before and they are doing it again and they and we will not be denied . ”
Asked about the difficulties in getting health care reform through the Congress and whether labor had hoped for more to be accomplished much sooner , she said , “ Again , the message coming from the people is ‘ We will not be denied . ’
Majorities want health care reformed and labor has helped lead that fight .
Because we did n’t get it as fast as we would have liked , that is no reason to give up .
We continued to fight and now you see the president fighting .
I am proud that the labor movement has helped keep this going . ”
Turning to labor law reform and passage of the Employee Free Choice Act , which has been stalled in Congress by Republican senators determined to prevent its passage , Holt Baker declared , “ Working people will not be denied this either .
A clear majority supports unions and a majority of those without unions want to be in unions . ”
She noted that “ we have a president who says it better than anyone else : ‘ Unions are not part of the problem .
They are part of the solution . ’
And we will continue to hold him to that . ”
The AFL - CIO leader took issue with those who interpret the election of Scott Brown , a Republican , to the Senate in Massachusetts as another sign of labor ’s weakening clout at the hands of the Tea Party movement .
“ Nothing could be further from the truth , ” she said .
“ People voting for Scott Brown were expressing frustration about the slow pace of change .
The Tea Party opposes health care reform , opposes jobs programs and opposes unions .
This is not true of the majority of Scott Brown voters . ”
Union leaders will use the next three days here to map out a strategy for a massive jobs campaign and for their continuing fight for health care reform .
They expect to carry out these battles in the context of the 2010 mid-term elections and say they will be mounting their biggest effort ever during those elections .
Vice President Joe Biden is meeting with the labor leaders on Monday .

A DVD version of Italian sadist film Salo has been given approval by Australian censorship authorities , but the federal government is pushing to have the decision reconsidered .
On Tuesday the Classification Board approved the distribution of Salo O Le 120 Giornate Di Sodoma Salo ( The 120 Days of Sodom ) , overturning a 1998 decision to ban the film .
The board gave the film an R18 + rating and compelled it to carry a warning that it contained '' scenes of torture and degradation , sexual violence and nudity ' ' .
But yesterday federal Home Affairs Minister Brendan O'Connor asked the classification review board to reassess the decision , though he did not say if he wanted it overturned .
The 1975 Pier Paolo Pasolini film tells the story of four fascists in Mussolini's Italy who kidnap teenagers and subject them to violence , sadism , sexual and mental torture before they are each executed .
Hi there !
Meet orphaned Karmann , the waving wombat nursed back to health by humans
She may only have a tiny heart - but luckily for Karmann the orphaned wombat , she was rescued by an animal lover with a large one .
The helpless little creature owes her life to a driver who rescued her from the pouch of her dying mother , who had been run over in East Gippsland , Australia in early March .
Karmann was rushed to the Warrandyte Wildlife Shelter in Melbourne , where she is to spend the next three months of her life being cared for in their state - of - the - art intensive care unit .
Hi Karmann !
The tiny baby wombat appears to give a wave for the camera as she nestles in the palm of a veterinarian's hand at the Warrandyte Wildlife Shelther in Melbourne
Blanky : Karmann , whose whiskers and eyelashes seem to represent the only hair on her body , will spend the next three months in the ICU
Here her temperature is carefully monitored and she is steadily putting on weight thanks to being fed six times a day .
The equipment to care for Karmann , who is now three - and - a - half - months old , was purchased thanks to a government grant and generous donations from the public following Australia 's devastating wildfires last year .
Unlike kangaroos , wombats have a pouch on their backs instead of their stomachs .
This ensures that as they dig their burrows with their front paws and strong , rodent - like teeth , they do not cover their newborns with dirt .
Baby wombats are not supposed to leave the pouch until they are about seven months old - which is why Karmann is being kept in an incubator and cared for so carefully .
Cosy : Karmann looks sleepy as she is bundled up inside a nest a blankets in the incubator
Lucky to be alive : Karmann was saved by a driver after her mother was run over by a car

If Doctor Who 's Eleventh Doctor has n't yanked your heart - strings with both hands yet , David Tennant style , fear not — Russell T. Davies will be writing for Matt Smith soon .
And Davies has found a surefire way to bring some angst .
Advertisement
Oh , and minor spoilers are ahead .
Be warned !
Matt Smith will be appearing in a two - part adventure of the Doctor Who spin - off show , The Sarah Jane Adventures , written by Davies .
And he's not the only guest star — also appearing will be Katy Manning , who played the Doctor 's companion Jo Grant from 1971 to 1973 .
( She was Sarah Jane 's immediate predecessor in the TARDIS . )
So expect lots more angsting about what happens to companions who've left the Doctor .

Says the BBC :
Viewers are in for a real treat , with an action - packed story full of Russell 's usual wit and warmth , which takes the gang inside a secret base beneath Snowdon and introduces brand - new vulture aliens , the mysterious Shansheeth .
All this , plus a trip to an alien planet – a first for The Sarah Jane Adventures .

But of course , Jo's leave - taking was the opposite of Sarah Jane's .
Jo met a cute young professor , who was vegan and had awesome fashion sense , and reminded her of a younger version of the Doctor — so she bailed on the poor Third Doctor , who actually shed a tear on screen .
New producer Steven Moffat has cited this moment as proof that the Doctor 's relationship with his companions really is at the center of the show , and Doctor Who is really the story of each companion and how the Doctor changes her ( or sometimes him . )
Later , the Doctor punished Jo for leaving him , by sending her a mind - altering blue crystal that was being hunted by evil alien spiders .
( Okay , it was a present , not a punishment .
But he might have known it would be trouble . )
And as we 've been reminded pretty often , the Doctor left Sarah Jane behind , ditching her somewhat unceremoniously because he was returning to his home planet , Gallifrey , and non-Gallifreyans were n't allowed there .
( Except for Leela , and Nyssa , and everyone in " The Five Doctors , " and so on . )

So how will this play out ?
Will Jo feel remorse for leaving the Doctor ?
Will she and Sarah Jane bond over post - companionship depression ?
How will Smith 's Doctor interact with two former companions ?
Actually , forget all of those questions — I just want to see Clyde visit an alien planet for the first time .
You can comment on this post , incidentally , over in the Doctor Who tag page . [ BBC ]
A temporary hospital set up close to the airport in Port - au - Prince , Haiti , has an ICU in back and medical - surgical unit in front .
CHARTING THE PROGRESS ON MEDICAL CARE , NEEDS IN HAITI CHARTING THE PROGRESS ON MEDICAL CARE , NEEDS IN HAITI Scott Plantz answered some questions from USA TODAY 's Marisol Bello about health conditions in Haiti .
Q : How would you assess the current state of medical care in Haiti ?
A : I think it 's improving .
My concern was that there seemed to be no central organization managing the supply of health professionals going in and out of the country .
As a consequence , there is an oversupply of one specialty and an undersupply of much - needed specialists .
A perfect example was that there were four orthopedic surgeons where I worked and no vascular surgeons or neurosurgeons , both of which are badly needed .
Patients needed craniotomies or other complex vascular procedures , and there was no one capable of doing it .
Part of the problem was that even if they could do it , there was no blood supply available .
While we seemed to have a great deal of supplies , there were key pockets of missing supplies .
There were no blood products , no IV nutritional supplements , no IV vitamins , which are needed to maintain nutritionally deficient patients .
Q : What do you see as the primary medical needs of the country going forward ?
A : The country needs food and clean water , these are primary medical needs .
As health professionals or citizens who want to help , we have to understand that we have to provide preventive medicine and acute care medicine , as well as helping the people provide for their own nutritional needs .
That means they have to be able to be self - sufficient .
Q : Do you see those needs being met ?
A : No .
I saw health professionals doing a great job of meeting the immediate health care needs of the people .
But I did not see any evidence of anyone making a long - term commitment to the health and safety of the people , and that includes improving the infrastructure .
Q : What struck you the most from your time in Haiti ?
A : I saw a Haitian mother caring for a badly burned infant , and the same love this woman had for her child , I see the same love my wife has for our child .
Q : What did it mean to you to volunteer there ?
Will you go back ?
A : I come back with an even greater appreciation of how great it is to practice medicine in the United States .
You go to a country like this and it helps you put things in perspective .
The people are so grateful for the care you can provide because they do n't get anything if you are not there .
The poorest of the poorest American is better off than 99 % of the Haitians .
I plan to go back in a month or so .
Scott Plantzwas in Haiti Feb. 19 - 23 to volunteer at a hospital for survivors of the earthquake that left hundreds of thousands of Haitians in need of care .
He is a clinical associate professor of emergency medicine at Chicago Medical School .
He is the author and editor of more than 20 medical textbooks , co-founder of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine and a senior vice president of Gannett Education .
He practices in Florida and Texas .
PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti 
Twenty years in inner-city ERs , I thought I had seen it all until ... Haiti .
Flying in you feel like you are being dropped into a war zone — helicopters , tents , military vehicles , cargo boxes and searchlights .
U.S. DOCTORS : Say Haiti stands out from other disasters HAITIANS : New amputees worry about life ahead VIDEO : First person :
Go aboard ' floating hospital ' USNS Comfort In Port - au - Prince I worked at Project Medishare and the University of Miami Global Institute hospital located 200 yards from the runway at the Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport .
The earplugs my wife tossed in my bag turned out to be a major lifesaver .
At first I thought I had arrived in chaotic hell .
I soon learned I was working at the best - organized , best - manned and well - stocked hospital in Haiti .
I worked in a 10 - bed emergency room with dirt floors , no privacy curtains and one trauma bay .
Patients were taken care of in outdoor tents or either the medical , pediatric or surgical wards .
There is an intensive care unit and a large operating room with plank wood floors .
The operating room has four teams .
We had a lab , pharmacy and an X - ray machine .
Staff accommodations included one large air - conditioned tent and multiple small tents .
We slept on cots and even had electricity , phone and Internet connections .
There were outdoor showers and toilets .
I was working in the lap of luxury compared to my colleagues at other facilities .
We had water and food , most of the time .
Protein bars and military MREs ( meal , ready - to - eat ) were the staple .
Hot meals consisting of rice and beans showed up intermittently .
In the ER I saw patients whose wounds ranged from crush injuries , to acute gunshot wounds , with a sprinkling of tropical diseases .
ER residents and nurses asked , " What 's this ? "
Invariably it was an end - stage clinical finding you never see in the United States .
Malaria , tuberculosis , typhoid and parasitic diseases were common .
Patients who looked to be in their 70s turned out to be 40 .
At this stage in the quake aftermath the trauma usually came from recovery attempts or fights over food and water .
One child had fallen off a 15 - foot wall .
His father carried him on his back 20 miles to our ER .
There was no neurosurgeon available for his head injury .
Fortunately , he did well .
The medical - surgical ward would take your breath away ; all patients in row after row of cots 12 inches off the floor .
The back ward had a row of paralyzed patients .
Being a quadriplegic is a serious problem in the United States ; it is a death sentence in Haiti .
One man , paralyzed from the chest down , arrived with both legs rotting off .
Haitian families lived all day in 100 - degree heat in tents across from the ICU .
Anywhere you looked was a patient with broken bones being wheeled around in makeshift wheelchairs .
They were the worst injuries I have ever seen .
Bones were literally crushed .
Even with the best orthopedic surgeons , repair was often impossible .
Wounds , some infected , got great care .
I was called to assist in the care of a patient found buried in the rubble .
Needed intravenous supplemental food and vitamins , which proved to be unavailable .
He does n't seem alive — skin and bones , barely coherent .
I am sure he will die .
The United Nations was an oasis not far from camp .
Identify yourself with medical ID and they let you in .
There is a restaurant with hamburgers and beer .
They even have showers and flush toilets .
There are tons of people hanging out .
Major subject of conversation is , " What in the hell is the U.N. doing ? "
Patients are arriving by foot and oxcart and the U.N. has at least a hundred unused vehicles and a dozen helicopters flying around dignitaries with no thought apparently given to providing medical transport .
The most frustrating problem is little communication between hospitals .
At Medishare we had four orthopedic surgeons with light surgical loads .
We found out just down the road they were sending patients home with femur fractures who were told to come back in two weeks .
No central organization is helping to manage the supply of health professionals .
I flew down with a group of 200 college students with no association with Project Medishare — probably the most frustrating aspect .
They came down to " help out " — each at a cost of $ 500 .
They had no construction or medical skills .
When you realize $ 500 will keep two Haitian children alive for a year , watching anyone arrive that is not trained is aggravating .
Funding the sending of carpenters or one bulldozer would have been 1,000 times more effective .
The entire country was overpopulated before the earthquake ; things are now a hundred times worse .
In the past we have provided immunizations , clean water and medical care , but the problem is you end up with 9 million Haitian people with resources that might support 1 million .
Returned home feeling we made a difference , tired and a bit frustrated .
Plan to go back soon .

The hockey stick :
The original and later versions .
Temperature reconstructions of the past 1000 years
If the beleaguered climate scientists of the University of East Anglia have a weakness , it is in their statistics – yet their conclusions that the planet is warming stands on solid ground .
That ’s the conclusion of the third independent inquiry into “ climategate ” – the fallout from last November ’s release of hundreds of emails from the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the university , which is located in Norwich , UK .
Crucially for the scientists who work at the CRU , the inquiry – led by Ron Oxburgh , a former chair of the UK House of Lords science and technology select committee – cleared them of any professional misconduct .
“ We found absolutely no evidence of any impropriety whatsoever , ” said Oxburgh at a press briefing in London today .

“ We are absolutely satisfied that these people were doing their job fairly .
I do n’t think they even minded what the outcome [ of their research ] was , as long as it was as close to truth as possible , ” he continued .
Career decision
That will have been a comfort for the CRU team .
As Oxburgh put it , they were “ unlikely to have worked as scientists again ” had the inquiry panel found them guilty of professional misconduct .
The panel found that the statistical tools that CRU scientists employed were not always the most cutting - edge , or most appropriate .
“ We cannot help remarking that it is very surprising that research in an area that depends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close collaboration with professional statisticians , ” reads the inquiry ’s conclusions .
However , “ it is not clear that better methods would have produced significantly different results , ” the panel adds .
Messy data
Oxburgh was commissioned by the university to review the professional conduct of the CRU scientists .
The UK Royal Society recommended his appointment and that of the panel of scientists which assisted him .
David Hand , president of the UK Royal Statistical Society and a member of Oxburgh ’s panel , said the work of climate scientists is a “ particularly challenging statistics exercise because the data are incredibly messy ” .
Climate scientists must gather temperature data from disparate sources .
Over the course of decades , temperature probes may have to be moved – because of the growth of cities , for example – and temperatures are not always measured in the same way at different stations around the globe .
Hockey stick
He said the strongest example he had found of imperfect statistics in the work of the CRU and collaborators elsewhere was the iconic “ hockey stick ” graph , produced by Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University in University Park .
The graph shows how temperatures have changed over the past 1000 years ( see graphic , right ) .
Hand pointed out that the statistical tool Mann used to integrate temperature data from a number of difference sources – including tree - ring data and actual thermometer readings – produced an “ exaggerated ” rise in temperatures over the 20th century , relative to pre-industrial temperatures .
That point was initially made by climate sceptic and independent mathematician Stephen McIntyre .
The upwards incline on later versions of the graph has been corrected to be shorter and less exaggerated ( for the full story of the hockey stick controversy , see Climate :
The great hockey stick debate , and Climate myths :
The ‘ hockey stick ’ graph has been proven wrong ) .
Hand said he was “ impressed ” by McIntyre ’s statistical work .
But whereas McIntyre claims that Mann ’s methods have “ created ” the hockey stick from data that does not contain it , Hand agrees with Mann : he too says that the hockey stick – showing an above - average rise in temperatures during the 20th century – is there .
The upward incline is just shorter than Mann ’s original graphic suggests .
“ More like a field - hockey stick than an ice - hockey stick , ” he told New Scientist .
Two other inquiries , by British members of parliament and Pennsylvania State University , have also cleared the scientists of misconduct .
Two further inquiries , one led by former British civil servant Muir Russell and the other conducted by British police , are still under way .

Superhero Style Watch : If Evil Doers do n’t Fear You , Maybe it ’s Your Sparkly Body Suit
There is a real and definite trend in ordinary citizens donning costumes to protect their communities .
We applaud our neighbors ’ efforts to make their piece of the world safer .
With that said , our Style Watch department has five basic fashion tips for the would - be heroes at large .
SW Tip # 1 – Unless you ’re in the gym every second you ’re not battling injustice , lose the spandex .
Professional athletes even look weird in it .
It ’s unforgiving ; and the last thing you want is to be self - conscious while dealing with ninja jewel thieves .
Pants are a nice , practical option … maybe a jacket too …
SW Tip # 2 – Pick an icon that symbolizes your ideals and work it into your costume .
Bank robbers are more likely to be terrified by “ Agent Dread ” than “ Captain Unicorn . ”
However , if your goal is to bring optimism and a can - do attitude to under privileged pre-teen girls , “ Captain Unicorn ” might be a good fit .
Do n’t be afraid to borrow an idea from comics or movies .
The people from DC will probably let a little copyright infringement go if you , as Aquaman , just saved the Mayor ’s daughter from sharks .
SW Tip # 3 – Accessories are useful to the real - world crime fighter .
Chances are you ’re not invincible , so an array of weapons , tricks , and effects might just save your behind .
If you made it out of cardboard , do n’t combat evil with it .
Conversely , if you carry a sword , someone is going to get stabbed ( they wo n’t let you wear that Mexican wresting mask in prison , Stabicus ) !
SW Tip # 4 – Wear sensible shoes .
Sure , high heels look badass , but try hopping a fence in them .
Also , no flippers or bare feet unless you are in immediate proximity to a swimmable body of water .
SW Tip # 5 –
While there is some debate among Style Watchers about the practicality of capes , we say “ go for it ; ” you ’ve obviously got other things to worry about .
That being said , if opting for a cape try to avoid , children ’s swing sets , doors that shut quickly , propellers of any kind , dogs , and strangulation by villains .
Thank you , citizen - superheroes !
We ’re serious about the spandex thing though !

The decline rate and colder weather have also contributed to a noticeable growth in U.K. LNG ( Liquefied Natural Gas ) imports and a decline in natural gas supplies sent from the U.K. to Continental Europe .
This pattern of increasing LNG imports and declining exports to Continental Europe is expected to continue .
Apart from a colder than normal winter , a considerable contributor to the growing use of storage withdrawals to balance demand this winter has been an accelerated decline rate in indigenous U.K. marketable natural gas supplies -- recently as high as 17 % on an annual basis .
Compared to previous years , this heating season in the U.K. has called for record withdrawals of natural gas from U.K. storage to balance demand .
This drawdown will result in increased demand for natural gas for refilling of the U.K. storage facilities this spring / summer .
DISCLAIMER :
The author holds no positions in the oil / energy market that may be affected by the content of this post .
U.K. STORAGE DEVELOPMENTS
The availability of natural gas from storage facilities adds needed flexibility to the supply system , since pipeline and LNG sources do not match up well with daily demand .
The U.K. storage system has 3 classes of storage facilities : LRS ( Long Range Storage ) , MRS ( Medium Range Storage ) and SRS ( Short Range Storage ) .
Simultaneous operation of these facilities can add 120 + Mcm /d to the supply .
Figure 01 : The diagram shows development in total working natural gas in U.K. storage for the contractual years 2005 - 2009 .
For the contractual year 2009 ( which started October 1st 2009 and ends October 1st 2010 ) increased use of storage withdrawals has been used to balance demand .
At present , it looks like the minimum amount in storage will be 400 Mcm ( or about 10 % of total working natural gas in storage , or about 1 day of present total U.K. consumption ) .
This level may be tested , if there is another cold snap .
April of 2008 ( Contractual Year 2007 ) saw a cold snap that resulted in storage withdrawals of around 200 Mcm .
The most recent weather forecasts indicate colder weather than seasonal averages for early April , so this could happen again .
This could call for further storage withdrawals and thus delay the start of meaningful storage injections .
Right now , as documented in the diagram above , U.K. working natural gas in storage is more than 800 Mcm lower than the same time last year .
The diagram above illustrates that the trend over the recent years have been increased use of storage withdrawals to balance U.K. demand .
It should come as no surprise if U.K. total natural gas storage capacity becomes subject to more demanding tests in the near future .
Figure 02 also illustrates that between December 1st 2009 and now , net storage withdrawals have been around 1 300 Mcm higher than in the two previous years .
The need for storage withdrawals seems very much to be weather driven and , as spring approaches , the need for natural gas fired heating can be expected to decline .
STORAGE REFILLING
Most of the injection / refilling seems to happen prior to August each season .
The reason for lowered injections during August and September ( apart from the fact that the storage tanks are by then mostly refilled ) may be that the refilling program is coordinated with the annual maintenance programs for the offshore production installations .
Earlier in the post , I mentioned that this spring / summer , U.K. storage refilling will require around 800 Mcm more natural gas relative to the two previous years and refilling will start later .
This calls for higher daily injection volumes and / or an extended refilling period .
Figure 01 ( shown previously ) illustrates that storage facilities have reached around 90 % filling by end of August in each of the years shown .
During April and May 2009 , injection averaged around 25 Mcm/d and declined to around 20 Mcm/d during June and July 2009 .
The diagram illustrates that during August and September , where the Interconnector ( Bacton - Zeebrugge ) normally is down for annual maintenance , natural gas injections for storage are low , and occasionally there are storage withdrawals .
Declining indigenous supplies , the higher need for refilling , and scheduled maintenance of the production installations suggest that LNG imports may need to be 30 - 50 Mcm /d higher this coming August / September that they were in the same months of 2009 .
On an average winter day , imports are now greater than U.K. domestic supplies .
At the present time , it is expected that natural gas imports from the Netherlands and Norway will remain at approximately level for the next few years .
How then should the decline in indigenous production be replaced ?
Continental European countries are also experiencing a general decline in natural gas production , so the only sources of meaningful additional supply seem ( based on current knowledge ) to be LNG and Russian gas coming by pipeline through the Interconnector .
” THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM ” IS DECLINE RATES
A major contributor to the steep increase in U.K. natural gas imports is the accelerating decline rates with respect to U.K. marketable natural gas supplies .
Marketable natural gas supplies means natural gas that arrives at end users -- that is , gross production adjusted for producers own use , operators own use and metering differences , etc .
From January 2009 to January 2010 , U.K. marketable natural gas supplies declined from 199 Mcm/d to 158 Mcm/d .
The steep annual decline rate is the proverbial “ elephant in the room ” .
Based upon data for U.K. , proven natural gas reserves as of end 2008 the R/P ( Reserves divided by Production ) ratio has been estimated at 4,3 as of end 2008 and as of end 2009 preliminary estimates for R/P results in a similar ratio .
This suggests that annual decline rates of 15 - 20 % for U.K marketable production should be expected for the near future .
THE INTERCONNECTOR
( Bacton - Zeebrugge )
Continental Europe and U.K. have mutually benefitted from the bidirectional Interconnector between Bacton and Zeebrugge .
For the period 1998 to 2004 , this allowed U.K. to be a net exporter of natural gas to Continental Europe .
Recently the Interconnector has allowed for U.K. exports during the summer and imports during the winter as illustrated in the diagram below .
One of the effects from the aggressive decline rates are that the flows between Continental Europe and U.K. are about to change .
As the diagram above illustrates , natural gas has mainly flowed from Continental Europe to U.K. this winter .
With continued decline in U.K. indigenous natural gas production , it may now be expected that the Interconnector in the near term will supply U.K. with natural gas most likely ultimately from Russia .
So far this Contractual Year ( as between October 1st 2009 and March 24th 2010 ) , approximately 3 Gcm ( Bcm ) less natural gas has flowed from U.K. to Continental Europe .
Inasmuch as Continental Europe ’s natural gas production has been in general decline in recent years , one might expect this decline to give rise to a similar additional amount of natural gas imports , mainly from Norway and / or Russia into Continental Europe .

The West Virginia mine tragedy
Miners doomed by collusion between regulators and coal companies
By Barry Grey
10 April 2010
In the wake of Monday ’s explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in southern West Virginia , a mass of evidence has emerged of wanton and pervasive safety violations by coal giant Massey Energy , the owner of the mine .
The facts show as well that federal regulators , well aware of the deadly conditions in the mine , did nothing to force the company to comply with safety laws and protect the miners from the inevitable consequences of the company ’s willful disregard for elementary safety standards .
Twenty - nine miners died in the massive explosion that ripped through the mine Monday afternoon .
The disaster at the Montcoal , West Virginia mine is the deadliest US mine accident in four decades .
Massey Energy Company , the biggest coal producer in central Appalachia , has long been notorious for its ruthless pursuit of profit at all costs .
Its CEO , Don Blankenship , a right - wing Republican multi-millionaire , made his name in the coal industry by heading up the union - busting operation against miners who struck what was then called AT Massey in 1984 - 85 .
Blankenship employed an army of paramilitary mercenaries , helicopters and armored personnel carriers against the miners , who were left to face on their own the company ’s terror campaign , court injunctions against mass picketing , and police escorts for strike - breakers , due to the treachery of the United Mine Workers of America ( UMWA ) leadership , which refused to spread the strike .
The defeat of the AT Massey strike was a milestone in the collapse of the UMWA and the destruction of the gains won by miners over previous generations of bitter struggle .
Blankenship openly campaigns against mine regulations and defies them with impunity , along with the rest of the coal industry .
The government agencies that nominally oversee the coal operators and enforce safety laws in actual practice run interference for the companies .
The entire edifice of coal industry regulation is a cynical exercise in which regulators go through the motions — citing violations and handing down fines — knowing in advance that the fines will go mostly unpaid and no serious steps will be taken to address safety hazards .
The common aim of both employers and regulators is to subordinate the safety , health and the very lives of miners to the maximization of corporate profit .
To cite some facts :
The Upper Big Branch mine was cited for more than 600 safety violations in the past 18 months , including 124 so far this year .
Many of the citations were for inadequate ventilation of explosive methane gas and illegal concentrations of coal dust — the two chief causes of mine explosions .
( Federal records show that as much as 2 million cubic feet of methane gas enter the Upper Big Branch mine every 24 hours . )
In a test in March , the ventilation system was shown to be circulating less than half the volume of air needed to keep levels of combustible coal dust and methane within a safe range .
As Pat McGinley , a West Virginia University law professor and coal industry expert , said , “ When a mine ’s ventilation system is n’t working properly or there is an unacceptable accumulation of coal dust even for an hour , miners ’ lives are put at risk . ”
It is almost certain that the April 5 blast at the Upper Big Branch mine — which some rescuers have called the biggest explosion they ’ve ever seen — was the result of a massive buildup of methane gas , compounded by high levels of coal dust .
There was no lack of warning signs that such a disaster was looming .
Federal regulators from the Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) ordered the mine or parts of the mine to temporarily cease operations more than 60 times in the last 16 months .
In 2008 , the mine was cited for 458 violations , 50 of which were listed as “ unwarrantable failures to comply ” — a designation of willful or gross negligence .
According to information posted by MSHA Thursday on its web site , the agency last December cited the mine operator for forcing miners “ to work and travel in dark - murky water ” measuring as high as four feet .
MSHA said the condition “ poses hazards related to tripping and falling in water … that could result in drowning . ”
The following month , MSHA charged the mine with “ aggravated conduct ” for failing to correct a “ known hazard ” in the form of “ combustible materials ” that had accumulated beneath the bottom roller of a conveyor belt located in the mine .
In March , MSHA cited the operator for allowing “ mud and slop ” as deep as 10 inches to accumulate in the mine .
The agency reported that the operator made “ no apparent effort ” to remove the accumulations when the agency carried out another inspection nine days later .
On Thursday , an MSHA official said that the Upper Big Branch mine had more than 11 times the national rate for the most serious type of safety violation .
Yet , despite all this , MSHA has refused to cite the mine for a “ pattern of violations , ” a designation which , under the Miners Act of 2006 , would allow federal regulators to impose a harsher enforcement regime , including potentially closing the mine .
In a letter to the mine operator in December of 2007 , MSHA said the mine had been issued serious violations at a rate nearly twice the national average over the previous two years .
The letter warned that the mine might be cited for a pattern of violations .
But , according to a report in the New York Times , “ six months later , the safety agency announced that the Upper Big Branch mine , and 19 others that were warned that December , had all instituted plans to fix their problems , and had received fewer violations .
They all escaped the added oversight …
After the violations went down , they more than doubled the following year . ”
In a March 25 , 2008 letter informing the Upper Big Branch mine that the agency had found no pattern of violations , MSHA wrote , “ congratulations on your achievements . ”
MSHA again reviewed the mine for a potential pattern of violations six months ago , but concluded the company showed no such pattern .
MSHA officials say the agency has , in fact , never used its legal authority to seek federal court orders or injunctions against mines showing a pattern of violation and posing a hazard to the safety of miners .
In any event , the enforcement powers of MSHA under federal mine safety laws are toothless .
Mine companies that knowingly violate safety standards — such as dust limits or roof stability rules — can be charged only with misdemeanors .
Moreover , as USA Today reported Friday , coal mine operators routinely evade paying even the relatively minor fines imposed by MSHA for major violations .
The newspaper reported , on the basis of its own analysis of federal records , that coal companies have paid just 7 percent of the fines they have received over the past three years .
Massey and the other major companies simply appeal major fines and contest violation citations , creating a massive backlog and effectively escaping sanction .
The Upper Big Branch mine , for example , has paid only one major fine , costing $ 10,750 , since 2007 .
It has appealed or is delinquent on 21 major fines totaling $ 505,000 .
Overall , US coal companies have paid only $ 8 million of $ 113 million in major fines since April 2007 , when fines were increased under the 2006 Miners Act .
By such means , the federal government , under Democratic no less than Republican administrations , has enabled Massey and the other coal giants to massively increase production and profits by intensifying their exploitation of a shrinking pool of miners .
Injuries , fatal ailments such as black lung , and violent deaths in mine explosions are deemed part of the production process .
Since 1978 , coal production has nearly doubled while the number of miners has fallen by half , from 220,000 to 110,000 .
In underground mines , production has increased 56 percent while the number of workers has fallen 60 percent .
Massey Energy made a profit of $ 104 million in 2009 , twice its profit for the previous year , despite a decline in the demand for coal .
This was accomplished on the basis of a cost - cutting drive , including 700 layoffs , wage and benefit reductions , speedup , forced overtime and savings from the evasion of health and safety laws .
Blankenship himself made nearly $ 24 million in 2007 and an estimated $ 28 million in 2008 .
Speaking from the White House Rose Garden on Friday , President Obama addressed the West Virginia mine tragedy .
While making a show of sympathy for the bereaved families and the mining community , he pointedly avoided any criticism of Massey Energy .
On the contrary , he attributed to the company a concern for the welfare of the miners that is entirely unwarranted , saying , “ But their government and their employers know that they owe it to these families to do everything possible to ensure their safety when they go to work each day . ”
Obama then quoted from a letter written by one of the miners killed in the explosion to his girlfriend and daughter before he left for the mine Monday morning .
“ If anything happens to me , ” the 25 - year - old miner wrote , “ I ’ll be looking down from heaven at you all . ”
The president was silent on what such a letter reveals about the conditions under which the miners are forced to work , and how obvious it was to the mine owners and regulators , as well as the workers , that the mine was a powder keg .
Following reports of abusive labor conditions at KYE by the National Labor Committee , the factory in China that manufactures Microsoft ’s Basic Optical Mouse — and a variety of other products for other companies — Brian Tobey , Microsoft ’s Corporate Vice President , Manufacturing and Operations , Entertainment and Devices , has posted the following response on the Official Microsoft Blog :
As a company that sells a wide range of hardware and devices , we take very seriously our corporate responsibility to ensure that the manufacturing facilities and supply chain operations that we use comply with all relevant labor and safety requirements and ensure fair treatment of workers .
We have rigorous standards in place , and have established a robust supplier Social and Environmental Accountability ( SEA ) program .
We were therefore very concerned when we saw a report by the National Labor Committee ( NLC ) alleging that conditions at a factory operated by KYE in Dongguan , China , were adversely impacting workers .
KYE assembles and packages hardware products for Microsoft and a wide range of other companies .
As a result of this report , we have a team of independent auditors en route to the facility to conduct a complete and thorough investigation .
If we find that the factory is not adhering to our standards , we will take appropriate action .
We should note that as part of Microsoft ’s ongoing supplier SEA program , an independent auditor has been inspecting the KYE factory annually .
In addition , Microsoft personnel conduct quarterly on - site assessments , and receive weekly reports from KYE on key labor and safety criteria that we monitor as part of our supplier SEA program .
Over the past two years , we have required documentation and verification of worker age , and no incidence of child labor has been detected .
Worker overtime has been significantly reduced , and worker compensation is in line with the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition standards for the Dongguan area .
Despite these earlier findings , we take the allegations raised this week quite seriously .
Another comprehensive on - site audit of the facility will be conducted next week , with a specific goal of investigating the allegations raised in the NLC report .
In addition , we will have monitors on site pending the results of the inspection .
We will take all appropriate steps to ensure the fair treatment of the KYE workers .
There are several contradictions in Microsoft ’s statement .
Firstly , if the corporation claimed that it had found no problems in KYE ’s factory conditions during independent annual inspections , then why did it feel the need to “ significantly reduce ” worker overtime ?
Kernaghan stated that overtime is not obligatory , but the $ 0.52 - an - hour wage forces the plant ’s workers to work 80 hours - plus a week in order to make a decent living .
Microsoft says it relies , at least in part , on KYE to provide its labor and safety reports on its own factories .
The annual inspection of the factory by an independent auditor failed to uncover the abuses catalogued by the NLC report .
Did the inspector not do a good job , or did Microsoft ignore his findings ?
What actually was the auditor charged with looking for ?
That no one was suffering abuse , or that workers were not asleep or improperly assembling mouses during the long working hours ?
Microsoft has used the KYE factory since 2003 , however , it has only required proof of age of its workers for the past two years .
What was the policy between 2003 and 2008 ?
And whose task was it to collect the information ?
If it was up to the management at KYE , then why would n’t they doctor the results , or leave out the details of the underage employees ?
Microsoft claims that “ worker compensation is in line with the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition standards for the Dongguan area . ”
There are no such standards specifically for the Dangguan area .
The Electronic Industry Citizen Coalition is a worldwide body with worldwide standards .
It acknowledges local law but goes further .
Here is its code of conduct .
Point 3 states this :
Apple chief executive Steve Jobs broke his silence Friday on the subject of his recent liver transplant as part of a tag - team effort with California governer Arnold Schwarzenegger to push for reform in the state 's organ donor process .
The bill , SB 1395 by state Sen. Elaine Alquist , D - San Jose , makes it mandatory for Californian residents to accept or decline the option of becoming an organ donor when they renew their drivers licenses , according to San Jose Mercury News .
Under the current system , residents are free to affix a pink sticker to their license if they remember to do so .
" The legislation would also create the nation 's first " living donor registry , " allowing altruistic people to sign up to offer one of their kidneys to a sick person , " according to the report , which cites Stanford doctors as saying that kidney donation is relatively safe and does not shorten life span .
Jobs , who underwent successful liver transplant surgery at Methodist University Hospital in Memphis , Tennessee one year ago next week , called the current system an " an obscure procedure " with " no one asking the simple question : Will you donate your organs ? "
" There were not enough livers in California to go around .
I was advised by my Stanford doctors to enroll on a list at a Memphis hospital , because it was more favorable to get a liver there , " he said .
" I was fortunate , " he added , referring to his financial status that enabled him to fly cross country in the four - hour window needed to transplant a healthy organ .
" Last year , 400 other Californians died waiting .
I could have died . "
Jobs , who six years ago also beat a very rare form of pancreatic cancer called an islet cell neuroendocrine tumor , was reportedly proactive in reaching out to Governer Schwarzenegger through his wife to get the ball rolling on reforming the process in his home state .
" Steve Jobs told my wife about his transplant and she talked to me , " Schwarzenegger said .
" Then we had great phone conversations back and forth .
...
He knew that others do n't have a plane waiting for them to get to a transplant . "
In speaking to other transplant survivors who attended a news conference Friday regarding the matter , Jobs conceded that he stared death in the face for the second time in just a few years but has since returned to good health .

Advertisement Sitting in a broad armchair in the front room of his home near Folkestone , UK , Reg Turnill recalls the moment he realised Apollo 13 was in trouble .
The former BBC aerospace correspondent had been covering the flight from the Johnson Space Center in Houston - home to Nasa 's mission control .
On the evening of 13 April 1970 , he had been at dinner with his wife Margaret , but later returned to JSC to " check all was well " and record a one - minute report for the BBC 's morning bulletins .
That visit would lead to one of the biggest scoops of his long and distinguished career .
" I was almost out of the door when I heard ' Houston we 've had a problem ' , " he tells me .
" What I did was go back to my desk , a few yards away , and there I stayed for the next three days . "
Apollo 13's commander Jim Lovell , along with his colleagues Fred Haise and Jack Swigert , launched on what was to have been Nasa 's third mission to the lunar surface .
Lovell and Haise were to become the fifth and sixth people to walk on the Moon , hiking from their landing site to explore the rugged Fra Mauro hills .
Mission control instructed the crew how to deal with the rising CO2 levels
None of this happened , of course , because , nearly 56 hours into the mission , an explosion aboard the spacecraft plunged the crew into a fight for their survival .
During lift - off , a potentially dangerous problem caused one of the Saturn V rocket 's second stage engines to shut down two minutes earlier than expected .
This forced other engines to burn longer in order to get the ship to orbit .
Nearly two days into the flight , things were going so smoothly that Joe Kerwin , on duty at mission control , told the crew : " The spacecraft is in real good shape as far as we are concerned .
We 're bored to tears down here " .
That sentiment would not last long .
We had this cascade of systems failures throughout the spacecraft
It was all at one time - a monstrous failure

Several hours later , the crew was instructed to carry out a routine stir of the spacecraft 's cryogenic tanks .
They heard a sharp bang and a shudder .
The exchange that followed between the Apollo 13 crew and Charles Duke in Houston contained five words which would enter our lexicon .
Swigert : " Okay , Houston , we 've had a problem here . "
Duke : " This is Houston .
Say again please . "
Lovell : " Houston , we 've had a problem .
We 've had a main B bus undervolt . "
Duke : " Roger . Main B undervolt . "
Reg Turnill explains : " There was an edge to those words , as spoken by Jim Lovell , and I knew at once , this was the big one . "
" An hour after it happened , I broke the story to the world on BBC World Service at about 5 am London time . "
On board , warning lights flashed , informing the crew that two out of three fuel cells had been lost .
When Jim Lovell checked the oxygen pressure and quantity gauges , he discovered one tank had an " empty " reading , while the other was plunging inexorably towards zero .
Unsure whether these were just instrument failures , the crew and the engineers battled to comprehend what had happened .
Thirteen minutes into the crisis , Jim Lovell looked out of the hatch and saw gas venting into space .
One of two oxygen tanks housed in the centre of the service module had exploded , damaging the plumbing to the other tank .
The blast crippled the craft 's main power supply and left oxygen and water reserves critically low .

" Within less than a minute we had this cascade of systems failures throughout the spacecraft
It was all at one time - a monstrous failure , " says Sy Liebergot , Nasa 's lead " EECOM " flight controller for the Apollo missions , which meant that he looked after the life support systems in the spacecraft 's command and service modules .
Mr Liebergot was an integral member of the " tiger team " that worked around the clock at mission control to come up with the solutions required to bring the astronauts back alive .
" We normally liked to start with the problem and work backwards .
But , as one of my backroom guys said despairingly : ' I do n't know where to start ' .
My feelings exactly , " he says .
Reg Turnill says : " Nasa was very quick to react .
Engineers and astronauts - some of the most famous ones such as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin - all flooded in and got in their simulators to start working out how on Earth you could get these astronauts home . "
Liebergot instructed the crew to switch off the power to as many systems as they could in order to reduce the electrical load on the remaining fuel cell .
This in turn would reduce its consumption of oxygen and hydrogen .
The teams at mission control in Houston were elated
A plan was agreed to use the lunar lander as a lifeboat : " It was a team effort to figure out how to get [ the astronauts ] back with the tools we had left .
Fortunately we had the lunar module with its full set of consumables : battery power , water , oxygen .
So that was a matter of determining how long we could stretch those , " says Mr Liebergot .
In an interview with the BBC , Jim Lovell said the astronauts never talked about the possibility that they would not get home : " We tried to figure out what happened .
If I had just waited for some miracle , I 'd still be up there . "
The spacecraft looped around the Moon , using its gravity to return to Earth .
This allowed crew members to take amazing pictures of the far side , but , of course , there was to be no landing .
Even as the crew prepared to make the fiery re-entry into Earth 's atmosphere , there were some last minute fears the explosion might have damaged the protective heat shield on the command capsule , potentially causing the spacecraft to burn up .
Fears about the heatshield proved to be unfounded " There was this period when we did n't know whether the astronauts would live or die as they re-entered , " says Reg Turnill , " That was one of the tensest moments . "
Millions of people followed the drama on television , hoping for the best .
But the wait would have been most agonising for the astronauts ' families - who remained extraordinarily dignified under an intense media spotlight .
Slung under parachutes , the cone - shaped command module appeared through the clouds , and exhausted workers at mission control were finally able to breathe their sighs of relief , raise their hands and cheer .
The capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean near Tonga , where the USS Iwo Jima was waiting to recover the three crew members .
After the crisis was over , it became clear the accident could have been much worse .
Post mission analysis showed that when oxygen tank 2 exploded , it generated a pressure of around 60,000 psia ( pounds per square inch absolute ) .
Sy Liebergot says this was roughly equivalent to detonating 7lbs of TNT and enough to level a 3,000 sq ft ( 279 sq m ) house .
Home at last : the astronauts were brought aboard the USS Iwo Jima
" If that panel had not blown off when it did , there is speculation that the pressure could have built up between the heat shield of the command module and the top of the service module , " Mr Liebergot told me .
This , he explains , could have blown apart the three tension ties that held the service module to the command module .
It would have left the two vehicles connected only by the umbilical which supplied electrical power and oxygen to the command module .
" Now you would have the command module flopping , hinged by the big umbilical between the two vehicles .
Now you 're dead , " he says .
" You 're just hanging there and you can't orient the spacecraft you are unable to use the lunar module . "
In addition , Sy explains : " The explosion probably happened at the best time it could .
If it had happened a lot earlier , before the crew had docked with the lunar module , that would have been the end .
And if it had been after the crew had used the lunar module supplies , that would have been the end . "
Although the mission was not a success from a conventional perspective , it was a triumph of ingenuity and determination by the engineers and astronauts .
Jim Lovell explains : " I think one of the things that showed the people of the world was that even if there is a great catastrophe , good leadership and teamwork , initiative and perseverance - these things make for getting an almost certain catastrophe into a successful recovery . "

Officials in southern China have launched a campaign to sterilise nearly 10,000 people as part of a crackdown on parents who violate family - planning rules , state media reported .
Family planning authorities in Puning , a city in the southern province of Guangdong , have detained more than 1,300 people in the drive , the Nanfang Countryside Daily said .
Those detained included parents who refused to undergo the surgical procedure and their " relatives " , the report said .
They were being held in local government buildings and lectured on family planning rules , it said .
China 's family planning policy generally limits families to one child , with some exceptions for rural farmers , ethnic minorities and other groups .
" It 's not uncommon for family planning authorities to adopt some tough tactics , " an employee at the Puning Population and Family Bureau was quoted as saying in the English - language Global Times newspaper .
The 20 - day campaign launched last week is targeting 9,559 people considered the " most severe violators of the family planning policy in Puning " , the Global Times said .
So far half the couples targeted had consented to sterilisation , the paper said .
Huang Ruifeng , a father of three , said he was contacted by a local official ordering him or his wife to have the surgical procedure , the Nanfang newspaper said .
Mr Huang refused , claiming he was too busy .
Later his father was taken away .
Authorities said they were using " extraordinary measures " to encourage couples to undergo sterilisation , such as refusing to provide the children proper registration documents .
The move effectively denies the children access to public services such as health insurance and free schooling .
The Nanfang Countryside Daily is part of the Nanfang publishing group , which is known for its investigative articles and other reporting that often pushes the boundaries of what is allowed by the ruling Communist Party 's censors .

This topic could be and is a full semester course at some business schools .
It is a deep and rich topic that I can’t cover in one single blog post .
But it is also a relatively narrow skill set at its most developed levels .
If you are going to be a public equity analyst , you need to understand this stuff cold and this post will not get you there .
But if you are an entrepreneur being handed financial statements from your bookkeeper or accountant or controller , then you need to be able to understand them and I ’d like this post to help you do that .
I ’d also like this post help those of you who want to be more confident buying , holding , and selling public stocks .
So that ’s the perspective I will bring to this topic .
In the past three weeks , we talked about the three main financial statements , the Income Statement , the Balance Sheet , and the Cash Flow Statement .
This post is going to attempt to help you figure out how to analyze them , at least at a cursory level .
In general , I like to start with cash .
It ’s the first line item on the Balance Sheet ( it could be the first several lines if you want to combine it with short term investments ) .
Note how much cash you have or how much cash the company you are analyzing has .
Remember that number .
If someone asks you how much cash you have in your business , or a business you are analyzing , and you ca n’t answer that to the last accounting period ( at least ) , then you failed .
There is no middle ground .
Cash is that important .
Then look at how much cash the business had in a prior period .
Last month is a good place to start but do n’t end there .
Look at how much cash went up or down in the past month .
Then look much farther back , at least a quarter , and ideally six months and / or a year .
Calculate how much cash went up or down over the period and then divide by the number of months in the period .
That ’s the average cash flow ( or cash burn ) per month .
Remember that number .
But that number can be misleading , particularly if you did any debt or equity financings during that period ( or if you paid off any debt facilities during that period ) .
Back out the debt and equity financings and do the same calculations of average cash flow per month .
Hopefully the monthly number , the quarterly average , the six - month average , and the annual average are in the same ballpark .
If they are not , something is changing in the business , either for the good or the bad and you need to dig deeper to find out what .
We ’ll get to that .
If cash flow is positive for all periods , then you are done with cash .
If it is negative , do one more thing .
Divide your cash balance by the average monthly burn rate and figure out how many months of cash you have left .
If you are burning cash , you need to know this number by heart as well .
It is the length of your runway .
For all you entrepreneurs out there , the three cash related numbers you need to be on top of are current cash balance , cash burn rate , and months of runway .
I generally like to go to the income statement next .
And I like to lay out a few periods next to each other , ideally chronologically from oldest on the left to the newest on the right .
For startups and early stage companies , a 12 month trended monthly presentation of the income statement is ideal .
For more mature companies , including public companies , the current quarter and the four previous quarters are best .
Some people like to graph the key line items in the income statement ( revenue , gross margin , operating costs , operating income ) over time .
That ’s good if you are a visual person .
I find looking at the hard numbers works better for me .
Note how things are moving in the business .
In a perfect world , revenues and gross margins are growing faster than operating costs , and operating income ( or losses ) are increasing ( or decreasing ) faster than both of them .
That is a demonstration of the operating leverage in the business .
But some early stage companies either have no revenue or are investing in the business faster than they are growing revenue .
That is a sound strategy if the investments they are making are solid ones and if they have a timeline laid out during which they ’ll do this .
You ca n’t do that forever .
You ’ll run out of cash and go out of business .
From this analysis , you may see why the business is burning cash or burning cash more quickly or less quickly .
You may see why the business is growing its cash flow rapidly .
I am most comfortable when the monthly operating income ( or losses ) of a business are roughly equal to its cash flow ( or cash burn ) .
This does not have to be the case for the business to be healthy but it means the business has a relatively simple economic architecture , which is always comforting .
From Enron to Lehman Brothers , we ’ve learned that complex business architectures are hard to analyze and easy to manipulate .
One thing that bears mentioning here are “ one time items ” on the Income Statement .
They make your life harder .
If you go back to the Income Statement post and look at Google ’s statement , you ’ll see that in the first year of their presentation Google made a one - time contribution to the Google Foundation .
That depressed earnings in that period .
You need to back that one time charge out for a consistent presentation , but you also need to be somewhat suspicious of one - time charges .
Companies can try to bury ongoing expenses in one - time charges and inflate their earnings .
You do n’t see that much in startups but you do in public companies and it ’s a “ red flag ” if a company does it too often .
If the monthly operating income ( after backing out one - time charges ) does n’t come close to the monthly cash burn rates , then something is going on with the balance sheet of the business .
Many of these differences are normal for certain businesses .
My friend Ron Schreiber told me about a software distribution business he and his partner Jordan Levy ran in the mid 80s .
They would buy software from Microsoft , Lotus , and others in bulk and sell it in small quantities to mom and pop businesses .
Microsoft and Lotus wanted to be paid upfront when the shipped the software but the mom and pop businesses were running on fumes and could not pay until they sold the software .
So Ron ’s business , called Software Distribution Services ( of course ) , was always out of cash .
In Ron ’s words , they were a bank and a distribution company and were n’t getting paid for the banking part of their business .
All during this time the revenue line and the operating income line was growing fast and furious as desktop software went from a niche business to a mainstream business .
Eventually Ron and Jordan had to sell their business to Ingram , a large book distributor who had the financial resources to provide the “ banking services ” .
They made a nice hit on that company , but not anything like what Microsoft and Lotus did even though they grew their topline just as fast as their suppliers .
Ron and Jordan ’s business was “ working capital intensive . ”
Working capital is the non cash current assets and liabilities of the business .
When they grow rapidly in relation to revenues , it means you are financing other parts of the food chain in your industry and that ’s a great way to run out of cash .
So if monthly income and monthly cash flow are n’t in the same ballpark , look at the changes in working capital month over month .
We went over this a bit last week in preparing the cash flow statement .
If working capital is the culprit soaking up the cash , you need to look at two things .
The first is if the revenues are real .
A great way to inflate revenues is to “ ship product ” to people who are n’t going to pay you .
A company that is doing that is operating fraudently so you do n’t see it very often .
But if someone is doing this , cash will be going down while profits are steady and accounts receivable are growing rapidly .
I always look for that in a company that is supposed to be profitable but is sucking cash .
The second is the availability of working capital financing .
If a business can finance its working capital needs inexpensively , then it can operate successfully with this business model .
In times when debt is flowing freely , these can be good businesses to operate .
When cash is tight , they are not .
The final thing to look for on the balance sheet is capex .
If a business is operating profitably , and growing profits , but its capex line is growing faster than profits , it ’s got the potential for problems .
Hosting companies are an example of a set of companies that might be in this situation .
Again , the availability of financing is the key .
Local cable operators operated profitably for years with big negative cash flows because of capex .
The fiancial markets like the monopolies these busineses were granted and consistently provided them with financing to buy more capex .
But if that party ends , it can be painful .
This post is three pages long in my editor so it ’s time to stop .
There is more to discuss on this topic so I ’d like to know if I did this topic justice for most of you or if you ’d like another post that digs a little deeper .
My preference is to move on because I ’m getting a bit tired of writing about accounting every Monday , but most of all I want to cover the stuff you want to learn or freshen up on .
So let me know .
The Hubble Space Telescope is an iconic observatory , a triumph of space science that may be the most famous unmanned spacecraft since Sputnik .
Hubble 's renown is certainly well - deserved , but the spacecraft is aging — it will mark its 20th anniversary of reaching orbit in April .
Hubble 's services are still in tremendous demand , because it operates above the bulk of Earth 's obfuscating atmosphere and so offers astronomers their clearest view of the distant universe .
In 2014 , when another large , space - borne observatory is set to be launched , the overworked Hubble should finally have some company .
Named for NASA 's second administrator , who led the agency during the development of the Apollo program , the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) will dwarf its predecessor by most measures .
( The project is a collaboration among NASA and the European and Canadian space agencies . )
Nearly twice as long as Hubble , and boasting a light - collecting mirror several times larger , JWST will also venture farther afield than its elder counterpart .
Whereas Hubble circles Earth at an altitude of less than 600 kilometers , JWST will set up shop 1.5 million kilometers away , well beyond the orbit of the moon .
During a February lecture at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City , Jon Arenberg of Northrop Grumman , the prime contractor on the project , presented an overview of the telescope 's mission and an update on its developmental progress as JWST moves from the design phase to construction and testing .
Arenberg , Northrop Grumman 's deputy for JWST systems engineering , paid special attention to the challenges inherent in building such a massive and complex machine — and then folding it into a rocket 's cramped payload capsule .
Read about some of those design challenges — and some of the remarkable feats that JWST should be capable of — in a slide show of images from the telescope 's construction .
Slide Show : 6 Fun Facts about the JWST
As the longtime Vatican enforcer , the archconservative Ratzinger  now Pope Benedict XVI  moved avidly to persecute dissenters .
But with molesters , he was plodding and even merciful .
As the A.P. reported , the Oakland diocese recommended defrocking Father Stephen Kiesle in 1981 .
The priest had pleaded no contest and was sentenced to three years ’ probation in 1978 in a case in which he was accused of tying up and molesting two boys in a church rectory .
In 1982 , the Oakland diocese got what it termed a “ rather curt ” response from the Vatican .
It was n’t until 1985 that “ God ’s Rottweiler ” finally got around to addressing the California bishop ’s concern .
He sent his letter urging the diocese to give the 38 - year - old pedophile “ as much paternal care as possible ” and to consider “ his young age . ”
Ratzinger should have been more alarmed by the young age of the priest ’s victims ; that ’s what maternal care would have entailed .
As in so many other cases , the primary concern seemed to be shielding the church from scandal .
Chillingly , outrageously , the future pope told the Oakland bishop to consider the “ good of the universal church ” before granting the priest ’s own request to give up the collar  even though the bishop had advised Rome that the scandal would likely be greater if the priest were not punished .
While the Vatican sat on the case  asking the diocese to resubmit the files , saying they might have been lost 
Kiesle volunteered as a youth minister at a church north of Oakland .
The A.P. also reported that even after the priest was finally defrocked in 1987 , he continued to volunteer with children in the Oakland diocese ; repeated warnings to church officials were ignored .
The Vatican must realize that the church ’s belligerent , resentful and paranoid response to the global scandal is not working because it now says it will cooperate with secular justice systems and that the pope will have more meetings with victims .
It is too little , too late .
Iron cobalt is known as the most magnetic material on Earth today , but a professor at the University of Minnesota was able to show that this may no longer be true .
Dr. Jianping Wang , a graduate faculty member in the department of physics , said he was able to show an iron and nitrogen compound is 18 percent more magnetic than iron cobalt .
The claim may disprove the accepted physics limits set for magnetization in a substance .
âÄúWe found there is a new physics behind the materials we study right now ,
âÄ ù
Wang said .
In his iron and nitrogen compound material , Wang said he found electrons in a form that have never been addressed in traditional theories behind magnetization âÄî localized electrons , which differ from the free - flowing electrons that are typically seen in magnetic moments .
âÄúWith the presence of localized electrons , you have to throw out all traditional understanding [ of magnetism ] ,
âÄ ù Wang said .
It is these localized electrons that lead to the high magnetization , according to Wang .
Wang said his study goes against traditional theories found in textbooks that set limits on how magnetic a substance can be .
This limitation is described as saturation magnetization value , which is a value of significance in looking at the limits of magnetism in a substance .
âÄú There are some materials where this value is beyond expectation or theory , âÄ ù Wang said .
Wang said he used a technique called X - ray magnetic circular dichroism that allowed him to look at the compound in a truly specific way .
Cecilia Sanchez - Hanke , group leader of the novel technique at the Brookhaven National Laboratory , said the method gives the ability to look at a sampleâÄôs specific parts individually .
âÄú What it allows you to do is look at the magnetic contribution from each of the elements in the sample , âÄ ù Sanchez - Hanke said .
âÄúWe have what is called element specificity .
âÄ ù
The specificity is important because it can tell each elementâÄôs contribution to the total magnetic moment , according to Sanchez - Hanke .
Before this sample could be tested , Wang said his team had to create a method that made the iron and nitrogen compound in a very specific and reliable way .
The method used is repeatable , which differs from attempts in the past , according to Wang .
In 1996 , researchers from the Central Research Laboratory of Hitachi in Japan made the same iron and nitrogen compound .
Their research also showed that the material exceeded limitations set by traditional theories .
However , scientists were unable to duplicate their experiments .
Wang said the inability to duplicate prevented the Japanese groupâÄôs research from being investigated further by other institutions .
This is something Wang made sure would not happen with his own research .
âÄúPeople hesitated to follow their work because there is no physics , âÄ ù
Wang said .
âÄúNow we provide the physics .
You can follow the recipe .
âÄ ù
It is this recipe that is mandatory for the research to be accepted in the physics community , according to Dr. Eric Fullerton , professor in electrical and computer engineering at University of California , San Diego .
âÄú The thing that always makes things go in science is when somebody else can reproduce it , âÄ ù Fullerton said .
Dr. Yves Idzerda , professor in physics at Montana State University , said that since WangâÄôs research challenges longstanding laws of physics , replication from unrelated institutions is crucial .
âÄúA strong claim really needs strong proof , âÄù Idzerda said .
Also , due to failed attempts from others in the past , Fullerton said proving WangâÄôs claim in magnetization requires a higher level of work than other research .
âÄú When you are claiming something others have been working so hard for , it comes with a higher expectation .
âÄ ù
If WangâÄôs findings turn out to be correct , Idzerda said the commercial applications could be huge .
One possible use of the compound is contributing to solving energy problems currently being faced in the United States , according to Izderda .
Izderda said the magnetic material could improve transformers and other technology used in transferring energy from the power source to homes .
âÄú These materials would allow us to be much more efficient in power generation , transmission and use , âÄù Izderda said .
Apple ’s iPad is proving to be popular everywhere — except Israel .
The country ’s Communication Ministry is refusing to let people bring the multimedia tablet into the country because it has n’t tested and approved the Wi-Fi technology used in the device , according to Haaretz .
Ministry officials commented , “ The iPad device sold exclusively today in the United States operates at broadcast power levels [ over its WiFi modem ] compatible with American standards .
As the Israeli regulations in the area of WiFi are similar to European standards , which are different from American standards , which permit broadcasting at lower power , therefore the broadcast levels of the device prevent approving its use in Israel . ”
The government seems serious about its iPad import ban .
Customs officials have already confiscated ten iPads and told their owners to ship them overseas .
The Communications Ministry has asked iDigital , Apple ’s distributor in the country , for technical information on the iPad so that it can work on the approval process .
There ’s no word on when to expect an official OK from the Communication Ministry , so for now it looks like all iPads stop at Israel ’s border .

An unmanned aircraft , operated by Nasa , has successfully started flying scientific research missions over the Pacific Ocean .
The Global Hawk drone is a robotic plane that is designed to stay up in the air at very high altitudes for an extended period of time .
Nasa has acquired three of the aircraft from the United States Air Force , which used the planes for military surveillance work .
" When they told us about this our scientific lust when through the roof , " says Dr Paul Newman , a project scientist and atmospheric physicist .
" We knew that this was the plane that would enable us to do things that we could only dream about . "
The Global Hawk can fly at altitudes above 60,000 feet ( 18.3 km ) , which is roughly twice as high as a commercial aircraft .
It can stay in the air for up to 30 hours and can travel up to 20,000 km , half the circumference of the Earth .
" It has many advantages , " says Dr Ken Jucks , programme manager for the Upper Atmosphere Research Programme .
We can dip our science toes into more interesting phenomena with this plane
Paul Newman , project scientist " We can observe something for a very long period of time , which is unique for an aeroplane that we use to observe the Earth .
The plane will be used to measure and sample greenhouse gases , ozone depleting substances and other air components in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere .
Scientists want to gather data to help them understand the processes that control both weather and climate .
The plane will allow them to travel to parts of the world that have previously been off limits .
" You can't fly from California up to the arctic but with the Global Hawk you can , " explains Dr Newman .
" It just opened up a whole new realm of things .
You can fly to hurricanes and you can orbit those hurricanes for tens of hours .
Right now we just have planes that can fly there , probe it and come straight back home . "
Spy plane
The Global Hawk was developed by the US government for reconnaissance and surveillance purposes and has been used in war zones such as Afghanistan .
It is typically used in situations that are too dangerous to fly with pilots .
Now retired from military operations , the planes in use by Nasa have been fitted out with a vast array of Earth observation tools , including high definition cameras .
They have been described as a hybrid of an aircraft and a satellite .
" We can dip our science toes into more interesting phenomena with this plane , " says Dr Newman .
The drone is piloted from a master control room on the ground .
In effect , it mirrors a plane 's cockpit with the joystick being replaced by a computer , mouse and keypad .
The flight is entirely pre-programmed , although it can be tweaked mid-flight according to the progress of the research and the prevailing weather conditions .
There are at least two pilots monitoring the flight at all times and other technicians who send commands to the computerised instruments on board the plane .
The flights are tightly regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) .
" They have a certain relationship with the military but the military tend not to fly these in our own airspace so we 're developing our own relationship with the FAA in order to be able to fly these in our own airspace , " explains Dr Jucks .
" We 're hoping as we get more comfortable with the plane , as the FAA gets more comfortable with us flying the plane , we 'll get clearances to fly over more populated areas , " he adds .
Nasa says it has as much control over the drones as pilots have on regular planes .
" The only difference is that there might be a little bit of a lag time between noticing something going on with the place versus us making the command , " says Dr Jucks .
The Global Hawk 's first scientific flight , over the Pacific , took place last week from NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California .
It lasted just over 14 hours and travelled a path from Dryden to just south of Alaska 's Kodiak Island .
A follow up flight on Tuesday was due to stay in the air for a record - breaking 24 hours .
The project scientists expect to launch at least one flight a week from Dryden and a portable ground control station is being developed , which will make possible deployments and missions around the world .
Overseeing the Global Hawk 's second scientific flight , Dr Jucks said Nasa scientists were in a " jubilant " mood .
" People are very excited about this , " he says .
" We 're getting confident now .
We 're attacking real science questions and this is the moment we 've all really been waiting for . "

The National Hockey League announced Sunday it will not take any further action related to a late - game hit by Chicago Blackhawks forward Marian Hossa on Nashville Predators defenseman Dan Hamhuis during Saturday 's Game 5 of the teams ' Western Conference series .
NHL Senior Vice President of Hockey Operations Colin Campbell conducted a phone hearing with Hossa earlier Sunday afternoon .
Campbell made the following statement after the meeting : " I have made the decision that this play does not warrant supplemental discipline after considering all of the facts , including reviewing the video and speaking with Mr. Hossa , " said Campbell .
" This play is distinguishable from recent incidents by a number of factors , including the degree of contact involved ; the fact that the consequences of the play do not appear to be as severe ; that this was a hockey play involving a race for the puck ; that Mr. Hossa is not a repeat offender ; and that the call of a major penalty by the referee was significant and appropriate .
"
The five - minute major penalty for boarding was called on Hossa at the 18:57 mark of the third period .
While Hossa was serving the penalty , teammate Patrick Kane scored a shorthanded goal with 13 seconds left in the game -- the first time in the history of the Stanley Cup Playoffs that a shorthanded goal was scored to tie up a game in the last minute of regulation .
Hossa served the final 3:57 of his boarding major as the Predators and Blackhawks went into overtime .
Ten seconds after exiting the penalty box , Hossa scored the game - winning goal to make it a 5 - 4 victory for a jubilant Chicago club and its 22,000 - plus hometown fans at United Center .

A proposal to dig tunnels for broadband fiber while constructing new roads and highways got backing from House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) on Wednesday .
The appropriately named " ditch - digging bill " is an example of better coordination among government resources , Waxman said in his opening remarks during an oversight hearing of the National Broadband Plan .
" Greater access to rights - of - ways at reduced costs can help spur the deployment of advanced facilities not only in urban areas , but also deeper into rural areas , " said Waxman , who is now a co-sponsor of the bill . "
The bill was introduced almost a year ago by Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D - Calif. ) with a companion bill by Sen .

The Broadband Conduit Deployment Act , introduced in the House in May , would direct DOT Secretary Ray LaHood to require the installation of broadband channels -- which could be filled with fiber later -- while the ground is already being torn up for federally funded highway construction and other transportation projects .
As a result , Internet companies can simply install the fiber lines when they build out new networks .
LaHood has said the plan " makes sense " and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski also supports the idea .
The ditch - digging proposal has become more relevant as the House Subcommittee on Communications , Technology and the Internet examined the FCC 's proposals for getting fiber all the way to consumers ' doorstep -- the so - called " last mile " of broadband networks .
" This is the ' dig - once ' concept , " Eshoo said Wednesday in her own plug for the bill .
" We can reap the cost savings of doing a two - for - one dig . "
Common Things Seen from a Different Angle
To ponder Vertu ’s ruby bearings and laser - cut ceramic keys is to imagine Thorstein Veblen , the Norwegian - American sociologist and economist , thrashing about in his grave .
In his 1899 book , “ The Theory of the Leisure Class , ” he coined the term “ conspicuous consumption ” to describe how people , rich or poor , acquire cool stuff to impress and to establish a pecking order .
To this guy , even silver flatware seemed like wretched excess .
Veblen would surely have seen Vertu as too - too .

One tech blog could have been channeling Veblen when it declared : “ Overkill , thy name is Vertu . ” But Mr. Nuovo , an amiable Californian who lives in Bel Air and tends to wear black blazers over black T - shirts , rejects that critique .
Beautiful objects are desirable , he says .
And as objects go , the cellphone is increasingly more ubiquitous than those old lions of luxury , fancy pens and wristwatches .
Vertu wo n’t release sales figures , but Mr. Nuovo says the company — which has more than 80 boutiques in cities like Tokyo , Dubai , Milan , Las Vegas and London and is opening one on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills in May — is plenty profitable , even in these tight times .
“ The watch is disappearing .
And everybody in the world is walking around with these , ” he says on a recent afternoon , spreading an assortment of cellphones — all of them Nokias or Vertus of his own making — on a table at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena , Calif. , where he was once a student .
If it is politically incorrect to have a finely constructed phone , Mr. Nuovo asks , “ does that mean we are forever banished to bits of plastic ? ”
Not if he has anything to say about it .
And this is the foundation of his happiness today : he has everything to say about Vertu .
As the company ’s creative director and principal designer , he can execute on a single vision — his own .
“ I made it very clear when I hired for this , ” Mr. Nuovo says , recalling how he assembled his team .
“ I said : ‘ You know what , this is going to be a dictatorship creatively .
You can all contribute .
But I ’m not holding back . ’” Vertu , based in Hampshire , England , has 600 employees .
We 've highlighted options for properly erasing your hard drives in the past ( some simple , some involving hammers ) ; in a similar vein , our friends at How - To Geek dive into the specifics of securely wiping your hard drive with an Ubuntu Live CD .

Have you ever given or sold a PC to somebody else , but really wanted to completely wipe the hard drive first ?
Today we 'll show you how to use an Ubuntu Live CD to get your personal information off your PC .
Advertisement
When you delete a file in Windows , Ubuntu , or any other operating system , it does n't actually destroy the data stored on your hard drive , it just marks that data as " deleted . "
If you overwrite it later , then that data is generally unrecoverable , but if the operating system does n't happen to overwrite it , then your data is still stored on your hard drive , recoverable by anyone who has the right software .

By securely deleting files or entire hard drives , your data will be gone for good .
Note : Modern hard drives are extremely sophisticated , as are the experts who recover data for a living .
There is no guarantee that the methods covered in this article will make your data completely unrecoverable ; however , they will make your data unrecoverable to the majority of recovery methods , and all methods that are readily available to the general public .

Shred individual files
Most of the data stored on your hard drive is harmless , and does n't reveal anything about you .
If there are just a few files that you know you do n't want someone else to see , then the easiest way to get rid of them is a built - in Linux utility called shred .
Advertisement
Open a terminal window by clicking on Applications at the top- left of the screen , then expanding the Accessories menu and clicking on Terminal .
Advertisement
Navigate to the file that you want to delete using cd to change directories and ls to list the files and folders in the current directory .
As an example , we 've got a file called BankInfo. txt on a Windows NTFS - formatted hard drive .
Advertisement
We want to delete it securely , so we 'll call shred by entering the following in the terminal window :
shred
which is , in our example :
shred BankInfo.txt
Advertisement
Notice that our BankInfo . txt file still exists , even though we 've shredded it .
A quick look at the contents of BankInfo . txt make it obvious that the file has indeed been securely overwritten .
Advertisement
We can use some command - line arguments to make shred delete the file from the hard drive as well .
We can also be extra-careful about the shredding process by upping the number of times shred overwrites the original file .
To do this , in the terminal , type in :
shred –remove –iterations =
By default , shred overwrites the file 25 times .
We 'll double this , giving us the following command :
shred –remove –iterations=50 BankInfo.txt
Advertisement
BankInfo.txt has now been securely wiped on the physical disk , and also no longer shows up in the directory listing .
Repeat this process for any sensitive files on your hard drive !
Wipe entire hard drives
If you 're disposing of an old hard drive , or giving it to someone else , then you might instead want to wipe your entire hard drive .
shred can be invoked on hard drives , but on modern file systems , the shred process may be reversible .
We 'll use the program wipe to securely delete all of the data on a hard drive .
Advertisement
Unlike shred , wipe is not included in Ubuntu by default , so we have to install it .
Open up the Synaptic Package Manager by clicking on System in the top - left corner of the screen , then expanding the Administration folder and clicking on Synaptic Package Manager .
Advertisement
wipe is part of the Universe repository , which is not enabled by default .
We 'll enable it by clicking on Settings > Repositories in the Synaptic Package Manager window .
Advertisement
Check the checkbox next to " Community - maintained Open Source software ( universe ) " .
Click Close .
Advertisement
You 'll need to reload Synaptic 's package list .
Click on the Reload button in the main Synaptic Package Manager window .
Advertisement
Once the package list has been reloaded , the text over the search field will change to " Rebuilding search index " .
Advertisement
Wait until it reads " Quick search , " and then type " wipe " into the search field .
The wipe package should come up , along with some other packages that perform similar functions .
Advertisement
Click on the checkbox to the left of the label " wipe " and select " Mark for Installation " .
Advertisement
Click on the Apply button to start the installation process .
Click the Apply button on the Summary window that pops up .
Advertisement
Once the installation is done , click the Close button and close the Synaptic Package Manager window .
Advertisement
Open a terminal window by clicking on Applications in the top - left of the screen , then Accessories > Terminal .
Advertisement
You need to figure out the correct hard drive to wipe .
If you wipe the wrong hard drive , that data will not be recoverable , so exercise caution !
In the terminal window , type in :
sudo fdisk -l
A list of your hard drives will show up .
A few factors will help you identify the right hard drive .
One is the file system , found in the System column of the list – Windows hard drives are usually formatted as NTFS ( which shows up as HPFS / NTFS ) .
Another good identifier is the size of the hard drive , which appears after its identifier ( highlighted in the following screenshot ) .
Advertisement
In our case , the hard drive we want to wipe is only around 1 GB large , and is formatted as NTFS .
We make a note of the label found under the the Device column heading .
If you have multiple partitions on this hard drive , then there will be more than one device in this list .
Advertisement
The wipe developers recommend wiping each partition separately .
To start the wiping process , type the following into the terminal :
sudo wipe
In our case , this is :
sudo wipe / dev/sda1
Again , exercise caution – this is the point of no return !

Your hard drive will be completely wiped .
It may take some time to complete , depending on the size of the drive you 're wiping .
Conclusion
If you have sensitive information on your hard drive – and chances are you probably do – then it's a good idea to securely delete sensitive files before you give away or dispose of your hard drive .
The most secure way to delete your data is with a few swings of a hammer , but shred and wipe from an Ubuntu Live CD is a good alternative !
Advertisement
This technique is n't the only way to dispose of data from an old PC , but it just goes to show how truly versatile a Linux Live CD can be when repairing a Windows PC — you can reset your password , clean off a virus infection , recover deleted files , or even recover files from your dead Windows computer .

The scent of a peat fire is exhilarating , especially for those who have not had to cut their own fuel .
I did achieve one dream by walking in a room - sized peat fire -- over one , to be exact , ankle - deep in germinated barley on a mesh floor that allowed the smoke from the furnace below to waft up through the grain .
Kilns are architecturally the most distinctive parts of distilleries , with pagoda roofs whose chimneys encourage the recirculation of peat smoke .
The kiln was comfortably warm ; fires are kept low , so that the barley will be heated only enough to kill the germ and stop growth but not enough to halt enzymatic action .
The peatiness of the barley , and thus of the whisky , depends on how much peat is used in the first twenty - four hours or so of the two days of drying .
After a day of being smoked and dried , maltsters say , the barley is too hard to absorb any more flavorful smoke , so plain hot air finishes the job .
The smell of peat smoke is unforgettable -- pungent and uplifting , somewhere between burning leaves and burning wood , with notes of wild heather and moss .
After I had spent several minutes walking the length of the cozy chamber and admiring the Chinese - style wooden ceiling , my clothes reeked .
" You smell like a kipper , " my host said an hour later in the car .
I could n't have asked for a nicer compliment .
THIS immersion in " peatreek " ( there 's a word for it , as for nearly every aspect of making whisky ) took place at the celebrated Laphroaig , one of three improbably beautiful distilleries in hidden coves near Port Ellen , on the southern coast of Islay -- perfect for unseen shipments , which explains why illicit distilling occurred there long before 1823 .
Laphroaig and its two close neighbors , Lagavulin and Ardbeg , all derive their water from sources that pass through peat , and the distilleries also heavily peat their barley .
Although technically not the Islay whisky highest in phenols , Laphroaig has the strongest peatreek in the glass , possibly from the three phenols it says its seaweedy peat emits when burned -- different , it claims , from those of any other distillery .
Whatever the reason , the blast of pure peat is strong , and is best appreciated in Laphroaig 's youngest and least expensive whisky , its ten - year - old .
Every eight hours , barley is raked by hand with wooden " shiels " to
keep the temperature low
I fell hard for Lagavulin whisky , which seems to have a unique combination of potent peat and equilibrated smoothness .
But I might have been swayed by the beauty of the distillery 's low white stucco buildings set against dramatic rocks and the sea , or the simple painted - slat vernacular architecture of its offices , recently fitted into a former malting floor and reminiscent of a turn - of - the - century ship .
Ardbeg , just down the road , has recently returned to active production after being periodically closed , and has won praise in the malt - whisky world , especially for its seventeen - year - old .
The distillery 's ambitious young managers are restoring its buildings with the help of the new parent company , which also owns the mainland single - malt distiller Glenmorangie , and have outfitted a particularly attractive visitors ' center and café in the former malting barn .
The pagoda is now a decorative roof , as it is at most of the island 's distilleries -- only two actually use their kilns , and the rest buy barley peated to their specifications from the local Port Ellen malting company .
Ardbeg is lucky to have survived and to be making a name in the malt world : traditionally , more than 95 percent of its whisky was used in blends .
Bunnahabhain , on the northeast coast , produces the lightest Islay whisky , and has very likely survived because of its utility in blends -- it is a defining component of The Famous Grouse , for years one of the most popular blended whiskies in Scotland .
( A blended whisky may include as many as forty whiskies ; more than half is usually neutral grain alcohol . )
Bruichladdich , another lighter - style Islay distillery , has been " mothballed " since 1994 , when it came under the control of the company that owns Jim Beam .
The Port Ellen distillery , in the center of the busy port , where ferries come and go , many of them bearing barley for the malting company , closed for good in 1983 .
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) -
An inland shallow - water drilling rig capsized near Morgan City , Louisiana , while being towed to a salvage yard , the Coast Guard said on Friday .
There were no injuries , and navigation was not affected by the incident in the Charenton navigation channel south of U.S. 90 near Morgan City , Coast Guard spokesman Mike O’Berry said .
“ This is not a major waterway , ” he said .
“ Nobody was on board .
It was being towed . ”
The incident followed the April 20 explosion of the Transocean Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico , in which 11 people died .
The rig sank and a disastrous oil spill has ensued .
A 210 - foot - long barge rig , which worked swampland and shallow water oil and gas prospects , was involved in Friday ’s incident , the Coast Guard said .
It had a 20,000 - gallon diesel tank but carried only about 200 gallons of fuel when it capsized .
Spill containment boom was put around it as a precaution , the Coast Guard said .
O’Berry said the rig was owned by T. Moore Services in Franklin , Louisiana .
A telephone call to the company was not returned .
How to Build a Bird Feeder
Learning how to build a bird feeder is a fun project for the whole family .
It can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be .
You can make a bird feeder from pinecones , peanut butter , and seeds .
Just spread peanut butter all over the pinecone and roll it in the seeds .
You can also make a bird feeder out of milk jugs and bottles .
You can also string popcorn and hang it from a tree .
Why Build Your Own Bird Projects ?
How much did you pay for your last bird feeder ?
$ 25.00 ? $ 50.00 ?
More ?
Would you believe that for $ 50.00 you could make 10 or more bird feeders ?
Just think how many more wild birds you could attract with 10 bird feeders instead of only one .
There are many wonderful and innovative backyard bird items on the market today .
But to be honest , the birds only care about the wild bird food or the bird feeder , not the wrapper .
When setting up a bird feeding station , you may spend several hundred dollars for a few bird feeders , a birdbath and a birdhouse .
But if you make your own bird feeders , birdhouses , birdbaths and even bird food you can save a lot of money .
You can even have a larger bird feeding station attracting many more wild birds .
So I decided to build a bird feeder myself .
My first homemade bird feeder was a log feeder .
I remember when Ifinished it , I thought , this does not look like a bird feeder .
Whatkind of bird is this going to attract ?
To my surprise , within an hour Ihad my first visitor , a Downey Woodpecker .
WHICH HOMEMADE BIRD FEEDER TO BUILD
Post Bird Feeder
You would build a post bird feeder if your garden lacked a suitable tree or high spot .
You may even choose a post one if you wanted a focal point in your garden to revolve around the birds that come and visit or you may prefer a post bird feeder so that you can naturalise it in your garden amongst the plants .
Hanging Bird Feeder
You may decide to build a hanging bird feeder if you have predators such as cats ( or children , dogs , possums etc ) lurking in your garden .
You will need to find a suitable tree that is capable of supporting the birds that will come and visit , the bird feeder and the bird feed .
Running Line Bird Feeder
A bird feeder ( or feeders ) attached to a running line and strung between a tree and the roof of your balcony may be a great option for those who do n't want to spend to much time having to replenish the food in their feeders .
As long as the rope is able to support the weight you may be able to hold a few different types
Ground Level Bird Feeder
You would only have this type of bird feeder if you are confident that the birds that come and feed there are n't going to be the dinner of some predator .
If you 're sure this the case then it may be a good way for you feed your birds .
Some birds , like finches , tend to prefer eating from the ground anyway and you may often find them picking up the spillages from hanging bird feeders .
Bird feeder plans will show you how to make your own bird feeder .
If you wish to restrict your feeding to only the winter season , you should begin in late fall or with the first snowfall .
Once started , the birds will become dependent on you , and you should continue feeding through the winter until gradually tapering off and discontinuing by March or April .
Sunflower seeds ( especially the small oil - type ) flow well in this feeder , and they are attractive to an array of bird species - cardinals , chickadees , titmice , blue - jays and finches .
Wild bird seed mix , finely cracked corn or chicken scratch can also be used .
Other species , such as juncos and sparrows , will benefit if you simply scatter some seed on the ground .
Others select entirely different foods .
Suet ( fat trimmings ) obtained from a meat market can be hung in a mesh fruit or onion bag for woodpeckers and nuthatches .
Fried meat grease smeared on the bark of a tree or log may attract chickadees and creepers .
Mockingbirds and bluebirds will sometimes accept cut - up fruit or berries .
Bird House Plans
DUBLIN , Ireland ─
It started with an explosion that destroyed the Nirvana shop in Dublin ’s Capel Street on Feb. 12 .
Five days later a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the Happy Hippy store in North Frederick Street .
Since then seven retail outlets with similar exotic names have been attacked with incendiary devices in different parts of Ireland , the latest being the Magic Bus Stop in Dundalk on April 15 .
They are all so - called " head shops , " which specialize in the sale of legal drugs and associated paraphernalia .
There are 70 such stores in the Republic of Ireland , and clearly some organization or group of citizens wants to put them out of business .
The head shops ' products have become something of a craze among Ireland ’s middle - class youth .
This makes them lucrative business ventures in recession - hit Ireland .
In a two - hour period on a recent Friday night , a television crew recorded 400 young customers lining up at a head shop to pay an average of 40 euros ( $ 53 ) for drugs with names like Snow Blow and Wild Cat .
These substances often contain mephedrone , a chemical in white powder form that mimics cocaine and is completely legal in Ireland .
The head of the Irish police 's national drug squad , Tony Quilter , said the force monitors the head shops and so far has found only four selling illegal drugs .
The police do not know who is behind the attacks on the head shops , Quilter said .
The chief suspects include local drug dealers who are losing business or vigilante groups worried about the effect of the shops on their neighborhoods .
As the public becomes increasingly concerned about the legal drug trend , the Irish government is rushing to prepare a bill to criminalize the sale of legal highs .
It has fallen behind the rest of Europe , where 14 countries have introduced measures to control the sale of such substances , with varying degrees of success .
A ban on mephedrone came into effect in Great Britain and Northern Ireland three weeks ago , giving a new dimension to cross - border shopping .
But lawmakers will have a hard time keeping up .
Twenty - four new , legal , chemical - based drugs emerged in Europe last year to satisfy a continent - wide demand for synthetic highs , according to a report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction .
Nine of these are marketed as plant foods or spices but can be smoked to give a similar effect to cannabis .
Mephedrone has been linked to a number of deaths in other countries , and much publicity has been given to the case of a young Dublin man , Daryl Smith , who tried to commit suicide after taking an overdose .
Smith was waiting at a bridge to jump under a train and then tried to stab himself with a screwdriver .
The 19 - year - old student is typical of educated teenagers who would never buy illegal drugs but regularly get high on mephedrone .
With the proliferation of new drugs , the Irish minister for community affairs , Pat Carey , wants to prohibit head shops operating as legal entities .
Banning the substances may not be enough , he argues .
According to the Monitoring Centre report , suppliers easily circumvent drug controls by offering unregulated alternatives .
The composition in terms of synthetic additives is constantly changing to evade control measures , and new packaging appears all the time .
Irish Justice Minister Dermot
Ahern agreed that one of the problems of banning a substance was that a variation of that product could be quickly introduced .
He is aiming to change the law “ to deal with the issue from a criminal justice point of view , as well as from a health point of view . ”
But some members of Ahern 's own Fianna Fail party sharply disagree .
Parliament backbencher Jim McDaid said his approach would be a huge mistake , as it would allow criminal gangs to take over the businesses .
Because of the adverse publicity they have received recently , some head shops have begun distributing leaflets offering home delivery .
In some parts of Dublin it is now as easy to get artificial cocaine or cannabis delivered to your door as it is to order a pizza .
Suddenly British politics has gone Hollywood .
That 's not a reference to pin-up boy Clegg but rather to the old William Goldman maxim about the film industry : " No one knows anything . "
Talk to those whose opinions ordinarily come armour - plated and they 'll admit they 're flailing .
Fifteen days out from a general election , such folk usually have a very clear sense of what will happen .
Not this time .
You'd think that a rash of opinion polls with the Liberal Democrats in either first or second place would have all three parties working out the angles .
" But we do n't know the angles , " admits one veteran of elections past .
" There 's no map . "
They feel like the crew of the Star Trek Enterprise , beamed down on a planet with an utterly alien landscape .
An immediate reaction is to hope they 'll soon rub their eyes and see that it was all , if not a dream , then a passing fancy .
Volatility is the word of the hour , expressing the hope that what has suddenly come up will just as suddenly go down – and normal service will resume .
Few expect the polls to return to the status quo ante , but they cling to the possibility that the Lib Dem boom will prove to be a boomlet and that the party will return to its rightful place behind the others .
One cabinet minister told me yesterday that he simply refuses to believe Labour can come third in the popular vote .
The Labour core was solid , he said , and the evidence on the doorstep told him support was " hardening " .
It will be all right on the night .
Optimistic types reckon the Lib Dem tide will rise just enough to lift Labour boats – perhaps by leaving them with the largest number of seats regardless of the popular vote – but not so far as to sink them .
They avert their eyes from the polls that put Labour in the mid-20s and savour instead the sight of the Tories , once apparently cruising towards Downing Street , now hovering around the 30 % mark .
A senior Labour adviser confessed he has been " pretty delighted " to see the smile wiped off David Cameron 's face .
For those wearing the rose - coloured glasses the very unpredictability of the election is itself a cause for cheer .
What was a foregone conclusion – Labour defeat – is now up for grabs , and that counts as progress .
Yes , there 's frustration at Labour HQ that when it comes to media coverage , they are barely getting a look - in – " It 's either Clegg or ash , " moans one operative , lamenting that Monday 's long - planned pitch on the economy hardly made a dent – but the larger reaction is nervous excitement : maybe we 're not dead after all .
That has to be wrong - headed .
For one thing , the battle now is about the mantle of change : Cameron had it , and last Thursday Clegg snatched it off him .
But that competition excludes Gordon Brown .
Whatever else the prime minister can offer – reassurance , experience – he can't be the champion of change , not after 13 years at or close to the pinnacle of power .
The effect is to push Brown to the sidelines , the place he might occupy at tomorrow night 's debate – watching as the two younger men duke it out .
Of course , there might be an electoral upside to that , the Tories and Lib Dems splitting the " change " vote and helping Labour grab more seats than both .
This is the prospect exciting those party optimists .
But it 's surely a false hope .
What kind of moral mandate to govern would Labour have if , for example , it came third in the popular vote ?
That same cabinet minister gave a test - flight for the arguments Labour would probably run on 7 May in response , insisting that these were the rules the election was fought on , like all elections before it .
And Cameron , defending first - past - the - post again yesterday , would hardly be able to object .
Other Labour officials are saying that they could hardly be expected to invent a new constitution over the weekend of 8/9 May – and the markets would go nuts if no administration were in place by Monday morning .
Brown would dutifully form a government , muttering apologetically that it's not his fault he won most seats .
But he would surely be drowned out by a furious chorus , enraged that a twice unelected politician should win bronze and yet ascend to the top of the podium .
It would be unsustainable .
And Labourites now heartened by the polls should look closely : they project the party winning a lower share than Michael Foot in 1983 .
And he at least came second .
Perhaps we should think bigger , towards the great progressive reunion of a centre - left that remained divided for most of the 20th century .
Some lick their lips at such a prospect , but there are reasons to pause here too .
The condition of a Labour - Liberal alliance would be proportional representation .
That 's needed now for Britain , but it will all but ensure Brown 's place as the last Labour prime minister to govern with his own majority .
Even if that does n't trouble independent - minded souls – and some among Labour 's younger generation – it is a prospect that chills the likes of Brown or Jack Straw or Harriet Harman or Ed Balls .
In other words , if the price of a deal with the Lib Dems is PR , it will come at a bloody internal cost .
A civil war could be a matter of weeks away .
So much for the view from Labour .
If Labour were quick to see the silver lining in the Clegg phenomenon , then the Tories were overwhelmed by the cloud .
Proof came on Monday with Cameron 's scrapping of a lavishly produced election broadcast , replacing it by a home - made effort shot in his garden – palpable proof the campaign was rattled .
Tory insiders say they are not working through the scenario of a second - place seats finish on 6 May .
They also say the situation is too " volatile " to speculate ( though a political discussion without speculation would be a short one ) .
And they also have their optimists .
One former party strategist says that even if the current polls are right it would not spell disaster .
The Tories will be able to claim they topped the popular vote – and outpolled Michael Howard in 2005 .
But that is to set the bar miserably low for a party that six months ago believed it was on the brink of power , even a 1997 transformation .
There would surely be a bout of soul - searching as to how the Tories could have failed to defeat outright a government emerging from the biggest recession in memory , fighting an unpopular war and saddled with a leader much of the public can't stand .
As Labour knows only too well , a fourth consecutive defeat inflicts deep trauma on a political party .
It forces it to contemplate the most searing change .
Some will insist that Cameron 's modernisation drive went too far , others not far enough .
Many will demand his scalp .
And how long could the Tories defend an electoral system that had cheated them of power ?
In this alien landscape deep craters beckon for Labour and Tories .
Only the Lib Dems , one imagines , would welcome it .
Yet they look as baffled as their rivals , Clegg apparently overawed by his success , keen to dampen expectations .
He too faces grave danger .
The purity of opposition has kept his party together ; might not the test of power – and whom to share it with – drive them apart ?
It 's possible that none of this will come to pass , that the bubble inflated last Thursday will burst .
But as long as it endures there is the prospect that British politics is about to change for ever .
Even by Hollywood standards , there 's a lot riding on how this story ends .
A new book has hit the bestseller list and is being promoted in every liberal nook and cranny imaginable .
If one did a search on this book , and read the reviews , you would come away thinking that it was remarkable , insightful , and of intellectual merit .
When I actually read it , however , it was incredible rubbish ; not because I disagree with the conclusions , but because the author , Nell Irvin Painter , is simply an unintelligent Black woman .
But the Left unashamedly promotes her book as if it had even a scintilla of redeeming value .
I saw Ms. Painter being interviewed by Stephen Colbert , where he mercilessly made fun of her while maintaining his liberal comedic bias — it was quite entertaining .
But Painter , author of The History of White People , has been interviewed and reviewed by the more serious side of the anti-White establishment .
Acclaimed for spending ten years researching and writing the book , she makes a mockery of Black scholarship — if that is not an oxymoron .
In fact one only has to read the very beginning of the book and the very end , to realize that she contradicts herself repeatedly .
The book makes no sense .
It also struck me that she probably had read Noel Ignatiev ’s How the Irish Became White and followed the same line of argument with slightly different material .
The book was published in 2010 , but it is apparent that she finished the book in 2005 , just ten years after publication of Ignatiev ’s anti-White screed .
In the Introduction she states , “ Today , however , biologists and geneticists ( not to mention literary critics ) no longer believe in the physical existence of races — though they recognize the continuing power of racism ( the belief that races exist , and that some are better than others ) .
It took some two centuries to reach this conclusion , after countless racial schemes had spun out countless different numbers of races , even of white races , and attempts at classification produced frustration .
Although science today denies race any standing as objective truth , and the U.S. census faces taxonomic meltdown , many Americans cling to race as the unschooled cling to superstition .
So long as racial discrimination remains a fact of life and statistics can be arranged to support racial difference , the American belief in races will endure .
But confronted with the actually existing American population — its distribution of wealth , power , and beauty — the notion of American whiteness will continue to evolve , as it has since the creation of the American Republic . ”
Now let ’s jump to the last chapter , “ Subsequently , an intriguing discussion on race and genetics has been afoot among Jews .
One side contends that Jews have nearly always seen themselves as a race , and that studies of Jewish DNA underscore the ‘ tribal ’ nature of Jewish religion .
The other side warns about the chaos that could flow from focusing too tightly on the biological basis of Jewishness , for Jewish men and Jewish women do not share the same set of genes .
While the Y - chromosomes of Jewish men show a relatively high degree of similarity all over the world , they are particularly close to the configuration of Middle Easterners of any background .
Jewish women ’s mitochondrial DNA , in contrast , shows much less similarity , leading to the conclusion that Jewish men often married non-Jewish women .
Treating Jewishness as something in the genes risks fissuring an already heterogeneous community . ”
What is so bizarre about this statement is that the same ethnic group that dominates cultural anthropology , sociology , and the biological sciences — that is Jews who she claims universally deny that races exist — are the same people who are claiming that they are part of the very real “ Jewish race . ”
She continues , “ The biological meaninglessness of classifying people according to race remained the scholarly consensus until about 2002 .
Then research came to light that sought to lump DNA patterns by population groups .
This work produced a theory that DNA falls into five major groups — Africans , Europeans and Middle Easterners , East Asians , Melanesians , and American Indians — which happen to correspond more or less to those of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and popular views .
( True to the disorderly history of race , a study in Scientific American in 2003 reported a four - way grouping . )
The New York Times illustrated its story about this research with a long colored bar graph .
Only in its last paragraph does the report explain that even though all people ‘ share most of their genetic variability in common , ’ the chart is based on ‘ these genetic differences , not on the very much larger shared inheritance . ’
In short , the illustration is neither helpful nor accurate , in that it wildly exaggerates differences while omitting the overwhelming degree of similarity .
True to racial thinking , differences were stressed and similarities played down .
The idea of biological race was reemerging as genetic science . ”
So she admits in the end that race does in fact exist according to many in the scientific community ; take away political correctness and there would not be any controversy .
Continuing again she states , “ This sort of reinterpretation seemed eerily familiar .
Liberal social scientists and geneticists feared that some geneticists were once again searching for genetic causes underlying diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular
disease that reflect racial disparities likely rooted in injuries of class and history
.
Lost in that speculation was the certainty that those diseases stem from a complex interplay between environment and the interaction of many genes , rather than the few genes governing superficial characteristics like skin color and hair texture .
Furthermore , rather than addressing poverty , social disarray , and unequal access to health care , genetics could reinforce the class and race status quo , thereby echoing the hereditarian gospel of early twentieth - century eugenics . ”
Again , the twisted mind of paranoid Blackness claims that pharmacogenomics is all about a conspiracy by White people for the explicit purpose of not having to spend money on the downtrodden Blacks .
It is surprising that we ever even see White scientists in public , since they have to spend so much of their time threading together these conspiracies against “ people of color . ”
Note how intelligent the Ashkenazi Jews are and how stupid are the Blacks ; yet they both constantly pathologize White behavior .
In the meantime , Whites just passively oblige both groups .
We dutifully do as we are told , under the threat of being labeled as racist .
It is all so transparent .
Perhaps we will decide not to endure it any longer .

HTC has issued another statement to TechRadar regarding the HTC Hero 's impending update to the latest version of Android - and it's not good news .
While we were all expecting it to land any time this month , at the Google Maps Navigation launch a member of the Google team let slip that the HTC Hero would be getting the necessary upgrade in June .
Bad news
And sadly , this has now been confirmed to us by HTC in a statement :
" HTC will be providing a free update to Éclair for European HTC Hero variants .
Starting in June , anyone owning an HTC
Hero will receive an initial preparatory update , shortly followed by the full Éclair update .
" For the full update , we would recommend using a free Wi-Fi hotspot or an unlimited data plan , otherwise standard data charges may apply . "
Watching the pennies
While it 's nice that the company is thinking about saving our data charges , we 're sure there are many people out there that would happily have swallowed millions of GB of data to be upgraded to Android 2.1 .
Come and check back on this story in June , when we 'll probably be able to tell you the upgrade is coming in December .

In Europe , the volcanic ash danger travels at high altitudes , but for Iceland 's farmers the problem is very much on the ground .
Farmers across the region where the volcano erupted this week under the Eyjafjallajokull glacier have been scrambling to protect their herds from inhaling or ingesting the ash , which can cause internal bleeding , long - term bone damage and teeth loss .
Near Skogar , south of the volcano , the ash blew down from the mountain , blotting out the sunlight and covering everything - pastures , animals and humans - in a thick , gray paste .
Berglind Hilmarsdottir , a dairy farmer , teamed up with neighbours on Saturday to round up her cattle , some 120 in all , and get them to shelter .
In the panic , some of the animals got lost in the fog of ash , and the farmers had to drive around searching for them .
" The risk is of fluoride poisoning if they breathe or eat too much , " Hilmarsdottir said through a white protective mask .

It took the Republican Party sixty years of dedicated effort to make the word " liberal " radioactive in some parts of the United States .
In less than half that time they 've also done a pretty good job of making " Republican " just as disliked , associated as it is with the politics of wretched excess , fetishizing ignorance , bowing to K street lobbyists , and diaper - wearing - toe - tapping - lesbian - bondage sexual hypocrisy .
So lately conservatives , and especially the most hard right wing of conservatives , have been on the lookout for other terms they can use rather than the dreaded " R " word when describing themselves .
Some of them have jumped on board the Glenn Beck self - promotion tour .
Considering that it's an artificial movement generated around a cheap media persona , declaring yourself a supporter of the Tea Party is a bit like being a proud member of a Monkees Fan Club ( and you do n't even get to hear " Last Train to Clarksville " ) , but hey , it plays better than being a part of the George W. Bush legacy .
Other conservatives have jumped in a different direction and declared that they 're really " small government Libertarians . "
Only they do n't seem to understand what Libertarian actually means .
Take for example this article in which Jacob Hornberger anoints 1880 as the peak of America 's Libertarian golden age .
Let ’s consider , say , the year 1880 .
Here was a society in which people were free to keep everything they earned , because there was no income tax .
They were also free to decide what to do with their own money — spend it , save it , invest it , donate it , or whatever .
People were generally free to engage in occupations and professions without a license or permit .
There were few federal economic regulations and regulatory agencies .
No Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , welfare , bailouts , or so - called stimulus plans .
No IRS .
No Departments of Education , Energy , Agriculture , Commerce , and Labor . No EPA and OSHA .
No Federal Reserve .
No drug laws .
Few systems of public schooling .
No immigration controls .
No federal minimum - wage laws or price controls .
A monetary system based on gold and silver coins rather than paper money .
No slavery .
No CIA .
No FBI .
No torture or cruel or unusual punishments .
No renditions .
No overseas military empire .
No military - industrial complex .
As a libertarian , as far as I ’m concerned , that ’s a society that is pretty darned golden .
Ah , the 1880s .
I can hear people getting wistful from here .
A golden age in which people kept all that they earned .
Of course , what they earned in the absence of those debilitating minimum wage laws could be nothing more than worthless tokens from the company store .
What they earned from twelve hours of work seven days a week could be actually be a bigger debt to the company that sent you into a mine or factory and made you pay for the wear on your tools , the water you drank , the fuel for your lamp , even the blasting powder you used .
Still , a lifetime of debt was n't so bad in a golden age without OSHA and its safety laws , since lifetimes could be quite brief .
Mining accidents did n't kill a piddling 29 men , they killed thousands every year .
Over 3 miners out of every 1,000 died on the job each year ( twice the rate of Great Britain with it 's freedom - robbing concern for safety ) .
But miners were pikers compared to folks on the railroad .
Trainmen fell at a rate that made each year of work roughly equal to the risk of being among the troops on D - Day .
Now that 's freedom you can feel ( well , briefly ) .
It was an age where any construction project worth its salt could measure progress by body count and factory workers were privileged to know that they really were valued far less than the machines they tended .
And death was n't all that this golden age had to offer !
It was an age when American workers could look forward to the liberation of being disabled for life , and know that they would n't be burdened by the crushing burden of worker 's compensation or government aid .
Any laborer making it to to retirement would find ... well , whatever they had laid aside for themselves , assuming they were paid in actual money and that they were cagey enough to hide it somewhere their employer could n't " borrow " it .
Meaning that a large percentage got to experience the invigorating freedom of starting a second career as a beggar after decades of crippling repetitive work , breathing toxic fumes , and exposure to corrosive chemicals made them unable to continue to hum hi-ho at their old tasks .
Well over half of America 's senior citizens basked in the autumnal liberty of living in poverty .
It was a golden age without labor laws in which only 5 % of people faced the awful restriction of an 8 hour work day while 3 times that many were blessed with a workday that was 12 hours or longer .
Many industries , breweries for example , had a standard workday of 15 hours .
And with all the extra freedom of that age , many children were able to experience the blessings of back - breaking labor starting every day by the time they reached the age of 10 , with more than a third generating freedom dollars before they turned 15 .
Of course , that was n't hard since this was a golden age of few public schools .
Except it was n't .
Public education was common across the country , even in remote communities .
Even the tiniest frontier village rarely went long without a school , many states had organized school districts , and in a good number of areas the ratio of teachers to students was actually higher than in our own socialistic era .
Perhaps what Hornberger meant to say was that there were few schools available to minorities .
In many areas minorities lived with " compulsory ignorance , " as they were not only excluded from public schools , but discouraged ( often violently ) from seeking education .
That accounts for a literacy rate of less than 40 % among African - Americans in 1880 .
As laws changed and more schools became available for all , that rate grew by more than 30 % over the next three decades .
However , white literacy remained about the same -- not surprising since whites were already suffering from those socialistic public schools well before 1880 .
It truly was a golden age .
One in which , thanks to that lack of nasty safety requirements and the troublesome health organizations , the average lifespan was all the way up to 40 !
An age in which , unfettered by the shackles of regulations on clean water and Hitler - like restrictions on sewage , 50,000 Americans died of cholera .
An age in which parents could experience the ultimate freedom endowed by watching 1 child in 5 die in infancy , and 1 out of 3 fail to reach adulthood .
Those numbers are for white Americans .
Minorities experienced even more of the freedom that comes from burying your children .
It truly was a golden age where there were " no immigration controls " as long as , you know , you were white and European .
Oh , and wealthy .
Otherwise , you were subject to laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act , or regulations that allowed anyone to be denied admission on the basis of poverty .
Once you were in , you could love the freedom from Jim Crow laws , and the liberty that came with being denied to right to vote , or the ability to protect yourself from abuse .
Of course Hispanic , Black , and Asian - Americans were all stimulated by the freedom that comes from having your home burned , your community ransacked , your wife and daughters raped , your belongings stolen , and your body left to turn as " strange fruit " in trees that sprouted across the country .
All without un-American interference by the government .
There 's no freedom like the freedom that comes when you are n't forced to endure a trial by a jury of your peers and can get on with more expedited forms of justice .
It was a golden age when the last bands of Native Americans still struggling along under the illusion that they were free , were invited into the real liberty that is life on the reservation .
And an age where they got to see the lands their ancestors had occupied for centuries or tens of centuries handed over for destruction .
Imagine the liberty you get from seeing your lands taken away , your children beaten for speaking their own language , your religious practices used as an excuse for slaughter , and your entire culture erased .
A golden age , free from money - grubbing FEMA , where 400 people could die in a snow storm ... then 400 more could die in the next .
An age when Florida did n't need no stinking assistance in picking up the thousands who died in hurricanes and Midwestern states laughed off the hundreds who died in tornadoes -- all without warning from a communist government weather bureau .
An age where dams could be built without concern for any damn fish living in the water , or any damn people living downstream .
An age where you were free to inhale the asbestos that wafted from factories and the mercury fumes that steamed from metal refineries .
And free to see the interesting effects such exposures had on your offspring .
An age without communist limits on commerce or immoral government tests , where thousands of Americans each year died from tainted food .
Where you did n't need no stinkin ' license to hand out medicines .
An age free from the horrors of the FDA where parents could feel good about using a childrens ' cough remedy laced with opium , cocaine , formaldehyde , and wood alcohol .
An age when nobody told us how much lead we could have in our water , or how much soot we could have in our air .
An age where the injured and elderly had the God - given right to starve .
It was a golden age of rights for women in which ... oh , wait .
Sorry .
I forgot for a moment that women do n't count when measuring freedom .
Good thing , since in 1880 they could n't vote , were excluded from many occupations , faced restrictions on their ownership rights , and were often treated as the property of their husbands .
Naturally , their reproductive rights consisted of the right to reproduce -- or die trying .
Of course , what Hornberger was likely envisioning was the flip side of all this liberty .
The freedom of being a rich in a society where those with money enjoyed tremendous advantage .
The freedom that factory owners and robber barons enjoyed in treating workers as they wanted , employing private armies to beat or kill those who opposed them , and indulging any whim in the sure knowledge that a large enough bribe could smooth things over .
The good news for Jacob is that it 's not too late .
It does n't require a time machine and a trip to the 1880s to experience all the joys of this golden age he so longs for .
You can reach this land of paradise with a couple of flights and a short boat ride .
It 's called Somalia .
The truth is , there are real Libertarians out there , people who place a very high value on individual rights and who believe this government -- like most every government -- too often interferes with those rights .
Of course , actual Libertarians realize that for individual rights to have any meaning , they require the presence of a body that can ensure those rights .
They know that freedom can't be maintained in an absence of information , and that there must be agencies that create the transparency needed for effective individual action and ensure there are consequences to dishonesty .
Real advocates of the free market realize that term has no meaning unless the market is free from coercion and the law is not defined by " might makes right . "
They know that individual freedoms are incompatible with a system where corporations are treated as super - citizens and that Libertarianism requires that workers be more valued that abstract entities that live only on paper .
The difference between actual Libertarians and Republicans hiding from their tarnished name is quite easy .
Actual Libertarians are concerned about the freedom of individuals .
Conservatives use Libertarian as a code word meaning " I want to continue to enjoy all the privileges I do now , but I do n't want to share them with you and most of all I do n't want to pay any taxes . "
Push come to shove , they 're happy to abbreviate that to " Screw freedom .
I just do n't want to pay taxes . "
The Indian Supreme Court is currently considering whether a controversial tourist resort in the Andaman islands should close .
The resort is near a forest reserve , which is home to the endangered Jarawa tribe .
The BBC's Geeta Pandey , who has visited the area , reports from Delhi .
Jarawas resemble African bushmen ( Photos : Survival International )
A handful of Jarawa tribesmen recently broke into a house in the village of Mathura in the Andaman islands .
They left after taking away rice , sugar and coconut .
The first people to successfully migrate out of Africa , the Jarawas came to the Andaman islands 60,000 years ago , scientists believe .
Essentially hunter - gatherers , the tribespeople have traditionally survived on the raw meat of wild boar .
But in the 1970s , a road ( the Andaman trunk road or ATR ) was built , cutting through the 1,000 sq km forest reserve in which they live .
It has brought momentous change to their lives .
" Till as late as the 1980s , the Jarawas would kill people if challenged or threatened .
But in the 90s , they started to come out of the reserve and now they have developed a taste for cooked rice and sugar , " says Govind Raju , editor of The Light of Andamans newspaper .
To get rice and sugar , the Jarawas often invade villages and settlements on the outskirts of their habitat .
' Guinea pigs ' " Tribals do n't believe in property rights .
From their point of view , there is nothing wrong in taking food from the villagers .
They do n't think they are committing any crime , " Mr Raju says .
The Jarawas are just one of the indigenous tribal groups living in the Indian archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar .
Short , with dark skin and curly hair , they resemble African bushmen in appearance .
Today , however , the tribe is on the verge of extinction with only about 320 of them left .
Tribal rights activists say immediate measures must be taken to prevent any further decline in their numbers .
For that , they say , the Jarawas should be totally isolated from human habitation and no commercial activity be allowed near their habitat .
Activists and the government have never been able to agree on a course of action in the past 15 years , and the Jarawas are seen by some to have become " guinea pigs " .
Authorities sometimes say there should be no outside intervention in Jarawa affairs , but at other times , they give them rations and clothes .
In a move to expand the Jarawa habitat , the authorities created a 5 km - wide buffer zone around the reserve forest in 2007 .
That put the spotlight on the Barefoot resort which had been set up the previous year .
Originally 3 km outside the reserve , it now fell within the newly - created buffer zone .
' Not practical '
The decision was clearly not well thought - out , says Mr Raju .
" There are at least 16 villages and settlements in the buffer zone .
And it 's the livelihood of the villagers which is at stake here .
Their fields and plantations are now in the buffer zone .
Where will the government re-settle them ?
It 's not a practical idea at all , " he says .
JARAWA FACTS
Part of first successful human migration from Africa , scientists say Nomadic hunter gatherers About 320 Jarawas alive today Resisted contact with outsiders until 1990s
One of five endangered tribes left on Andaman and Nicobar Islands Samit Sawhney , managing director of Barefoot , believes the company is being penalised unfairly .
He says many other operators are also taking visitors along the Andaman trunk road .
" Initially , we closed our resort after the government order , " Mr Sawhney told the BBC by telephone from the southern Indian city of Madras ( Chennai ) .
" But then we realised that hundreds of tour operators in the buffer zone continued to do business and 500 tourists were passing through the reserve forest area every day through the ATR . "
Barefoot challenged the order in a local court which ruled in its favour .
But after the Calcutta high court rejected the government 's appeal , the authorities went to the Supreme Court .
Earlier in March it said " all high court orders are inoperative " until it had decided the case .
" The resort is shut until further notice , " Mr Sawhney says .
Some environmentalists and anthropologists have welcomed the move , but they say a much bigger threat to the tribespeople is from the road .
Law prevents any photography of the tribespeople or any interaction with them , but a drive along the trunk road shows how the law is routinely flouted , with officials turning a blind eye to them .
" A number of illicit tour operators take tourists through the area every day only with the purpose of seeing the Jarawas , " Miriam Ross of Survival International told the BBC .
" The authorities have ignored a 2002 Supreme Court ruling to close the road .
It brings poachers , tourists and other outsiders into daily contact with the Jarawas , putting them at serious risk of disease , " she says .
Dilemma Ms Ross points to the outbreak of measles among the tribespeople in 1997 and 2006 which infected scores of Jarawas .
There are only a few hundred Andaman tribespeople left Today , they can often be seen hanging around near the highway and begging for food from tourists .
Many of the youngsters have learnt popular Bollywood songs and Hindi slang with which they entertain visitors .
The tribespeople , who used to roam naked in the jungles , have now begun to dress in jeans and T - shirts .
At a recent meeting with senior state administration officials , a Jarawa spokesman asked for schools and mobile phones .
" The older generation does not like mingling with outsiders .
But the new generation knows the benefit of mixing with the settlers .
And they have become aspirational , " says Mr Raju .
The big dilemma for policy makers then is whether there should be total isolation of the Jarawas or not ?
Also , many ask if the policy of total isolation will work at all ?
Some say it may be already too late .
" We did not intervene when we should have , " Mr Raju says .
" The dilemma now is - should they be brought into modern - day reality ?
Or should they be pushed back in time ? "
It 's a tough call to make , but unless a " very serious last attempt " is made to protect them , the Jarawas may soon become history .

( WOMENSNEWS ) –Gender ratings in health insurance mean that women pay more for the same coverage than men .
Health reform promises to end gender rating but the details and start dates vary depending on the type of policy , size of the employer and state .
In a question - and - answer about loopholes that could allow gender rating to live on , Lisa M. Codispoti , senior counsel of the National Women ’s Law Center in Washington , D.C. , emphasizes that a federal law obliges any insurer that accepts federal funding to end gender ratings immediately .
Sharon Johnson conducted the interview for Women ’s eNews .
S.J. : I understand there are still many loopholes that will subject women to backdoor gender discrimination until 2014 , when various provisions in the law take effect .
L.C. : Yes , that is why women ’s groups are going to have to be very active in making sure that the implementation of these regulations helps them .
We ca n’t assume that the passage of this law means that gender discrimination is behind us …
That is why the National Women ’s Law Center is now looking at what we can do to close these loopholes by using the anti-discrimination provisions in the law that prohibit recipients of federal funds –including insurance companies –from discriminating in health care .
These anti-discrimination measures take effect now .
S.J. : Individual policies , where people buy coverage directly from insurance companies , are more expensive than employer - provided health insurance .
Gender rating in the individual market intensifies this problem .
How common are gender ratings in the individual market ?
L.C. : Very common .
In 40 states and the District of Columbia insurers are currently allowed to consider gender when setting premium rates in the individual health insurance market .
Twelve states have banned the practice in the individual market , although the laws have n’t taken effect yet in California and New Mexico .
Gender Rating in the Group Market
S.J. : What about the group market ?
That ’s where most people get their insurance .
L.C. : Although federal law prohibits employers from charging individual male and female employees different rates for coverage , insurance companies are allowed to consider the proportion of women a business employs when determining the group ’s overall premium .
As a result , businesses with predominantly female work forces–such as child care centers–can end up paying a lot more for coverage .
Fourteen states have laws that prohibit gender rating for group health plans , although the change has n’t taken effect yet in New Mexico .
However , nearly all of those protections are limited to " small " businesses , up to 50 employees .
Montana is the only state that bans gender rating across all insurance markets and for groups of all sizes .
S.J. : Elimination of gender ratings wo n’t apply to plans offered by employers with more than 100 employees , unless a state allows large employers to enter the insurance exchanges after 2017 .
Is that correct ?
L.C. :
The law provides that the new insurance rules –including the ban on gender rating –would apply to large groups only if a state acts to allow larger groups into the exchanges in 2017 .
However , there is an additional provision in the law that prohibits recipients of federal funds –including insurance companies –from discrimination in health care on the basis of sex , race , national origin , disability and age .
This provision takes effect immediately .
It is our position that the anti-discrimination provision would immediately prohibit insurance companies that received federal funds from gender rating in the sale of any health insurance product .
S.J. : What impact will the loophole of failing to completely end the practice of gender rating have for women employed by large companies until 2017 ?
L.C. : We believe the anti-discrimination provision will close this loophole .
However , without the anti-discrimination provision to close the loophole for larger employers–in states that do not allow large employers over 100 employees into the exchange–we know that larger employers with a high proportion of female employees would continue to face higher premiums based simply on the gender composition of their work force .
Benefits for Large Employers
S.J. : Do you think states will allow large employers to enter the insurance exchanges after 2017 ?
What advantage , if any , will this have for women ?
For employers ?
For the states ?
L.C. :
It is too early to tell whether states would allow larger employers into the exchanges .
The benefit for employers is that they will have access to a larger pool with which to band together and hopefully obtain more comprehensive health coverage for more reasonable premiums .
S.J. : Provisions outlawing gender discrimination , setting up exchanges and giving small businesses tax credits to offer coverage to their employees do n’t take effect until 2014 .
In 24 states , one insurance company controls 70 percent of the market , so women wo n’t have a lot of choice for the next four years .
L.C. :
The bill tries to solve the competition problem through the new exchanges .
Many of us would like to see the exchanges up and running before 2014 , but we have to keep in mind that lots of work must be done to set up the exchanges .
2014 is the deadline .
Some exchanges may be up and running before that time .
There is no reason for states not to move in that direction .
Several weeks ago , Colorado ’s governor signed a bill that bans gender rating in the individual market .
New Mexico already has done so in the individual market .
Maine has also passed legislation .
There are some positive trends .
Women in Small Businesses
S.J. : How will this legislation affect the numerous women who work for small businesses ?
Many owners and managers of small businesses have told me they want to provide insurance but could n’t afford it .
L.C. : Women are more likely than men to work for small businesses that do n’t offer health insurance .
This legislation does try to help provide affordable coverage for small employers by setting up the new exchanges where small businesses with up to 100 employees will be able to pool together to shop for coverage .
The legislation also tries to make providing coverage more affordable by giving small businesses tax credits .
These tax credits begin in 2010 .
About $ 40 billion will be available over the next 10 years to help make coverage affordable .
If a small business ( up to 50 workers ) pays at least half of its employees ’ premiums , it can receive a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the contribution from 2010 to 2013 .
After 2014 , small businesses will be able to buy insurance through the exchanges and get a tax credit of up to 50 percent of employees ’ premiums for two years .

What to know for 2020 high school football season
By Andy Dangerfield
BBC News
Charles Bronson 's artwork displayed on the Tube at Angel station A victims ' charity has said it is " astonished " artwork by notorious British criminal Charles Bronson has been put on display on the Tube .
The drawing , which depicts a head with three faces poking out of a straitjacket , went on display at Angel station in north London on Monday .
Benjamin Moore , from Art Below , which displays art on the Tube , said the artwork was " unique " .
The National Victims ' Association said it was " depressed " the work was put up .
A Transport for London ( TfL ) spokesperson said : " Art Below is not part of the Art on the Underground , the Tube 's official arts programme . "
Bronson , 58 , was jailed for armed robbery in 1974 .
He has committed a string of crimes behind bars , including hostage - taking , and rooftop protests and has spent much of his time in jail in solitary confinement .
Mr Moore came into contact with Bronson through mutual friend Tom Hardy , who played the criminal in the 2009 film Bronson , which is based loosely on the prisoner 's life .
He received a letter from Bronson saying he would like his work displayed on the network .
' Dastardly behaviour '
The artwork , which will be displayed at the station for two weeks , is one of about 60 pieces by Bronson that Mr Moore says he saw and was among only a few that made it through copy approval by TfL .
" There 's a lot of madness and sadness in his work but what struck me was the humour , " Mr Moore said .
He says he thinks Bronson 's artwork is unique because of the amount of time he has spent in confinement .
The former bare - knuckle fighter has committed violent crimes in prison " You 'll never see any artwork like it because no artist is going to spend more than 36 years inside an incarcerated space . "
But the National Victims ' Association ( NVA ) , which supports victims and families affected by crime , criticised the move .
" I would say that the overwhelming majority of victims of crime will be astonished and thoroughly depressed that one of the most violent criminals in the prison system is allowed to engage with the British public in this way , " a NVA spokesman said .
" There will be many members of the public who will find it deeply disturbing to be confronted by someone whose behaviour towards society is so dastardly . "
Mr Moore said that the art " comes from a place no one else will ever reach .
In that sense it 's quite dark .
He 's lived inside his mind for all that time . "
" His art and his physical training are the two things that have helped him survive mentally this long . "
The prisoner is said to have developed an extreme fitness regime while in prison and has had a book published , advising how to exercise with minimal resources and space .

A MONSTER hammerhead shark caught off NSW 's northern coast could soon become a Queensland tourism attraction .
Famed Hervey
Bay shark hunter Vic Hislop has bought the 1200kg , 5 m monster and this week transported the amazing catch to Queensland .
The huge shark made headlines in northern NSW last month when it was caught by a fishing boat four nautical miles off the coast of Evans Head .
It had eaten a smaller shark hooked by the fishing boat and then became trapped itself .
At 5 m long , the shark is longer than a family car and could probably comfortably fit a few family members inside its massive belly .
Researchers estimate the shark was at least 40 years old .
Speaking to The Courier - Mail , Mr Hislop said he had not decided whether to house the spectacular specimen at his Hervey Bay shark show .
" It 's a magnificent specimen that 's for sure , " he said .
" I have n't decided what I am going to do with it yet though .
" If I keep it there ( at the shark museum ) I will freeze it first . "
Some species of hammerheads are on the global endangered list , but they are rarely implicated in attacks on humans .
Although that would be of little comfort to someone faced with a shark bigger than most Great Whites , the most feared of all sharks .
And Mr Hislop had even more chilling news .
" That 's not the biggest one I 've seen either , " he said .
" I 've caught bigger . "

NEWPORT , R.I. —
Following in the wake of three rebellious New Yorkers who inaugurated the Transatlantic Race in December 1866 , a fleet of 13 intrepid crews conquered a restive North Atlantic Ocean from late June to early July in the 31st running of the classic yacht race .
Although this year ’s race will go down as one of the slowest and lightest on record — the winning elapsed time was more than three days off record pace — there was plenty of competition throughout the fleet : battles for podium positions that were decided in the final 200 nautical miles of the 2,960 - nuatical mile race .
And battles with that old sage Mother Nature , whose ocean was at times frothy and wet and at others frustratingly windless and serene .
“ We had a great race .
It was really successful from our point of view in terms of enjoyment , fun and safety , ” said Ian Budgen , tactician on Clarke Murphy ’s 82 - footer Aegir , which placed fourth in IRC 2 .
“ In our class it turned out to be a small boat race .
Realistically , when you go handicap racing offshore , you ’re at the mercy of the weather systems .
For us the race was calm with winds mostly in the single digits or teens .
Our max windspeed was 27 or 28 knots , but for a very short period of time . ”
Yachts crossing the North Atlantic typically have to deal with repeated fronts that pass them as a stream of depressions moves towards Europe .
For the first few days of the race this was the case .
After the start on June 25 off Newport ’s Castle Hill Light in a 10 - knot southerly , the fleet was beating in 15 to 20 knots with torrential rain and lightning that evening as they headed for the first mandatory waypoints south of Nantucket Shoals and the Right Whale Critical Habitat Area .

SAN JOSE , Calif . --
The Detroit Red Wings -- management and players -- did not feel spurned when Jiri Hudler bolted for Russia last summer .
They understand it 's a business .
They also will enthusiastically welcome him back next season .
" We 're happy to have him back , '' Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said .
" We 're in a real competitive business .
You want to find every opportunity you can to make your team better . ''
Hudler 's agent , Petr Svoboda , confirmed Friday that the small but skilled 26 - year - old forward will rejoin the Red Wings in 2010 - 11 after spending one year with Moscow Dynamo of Russia 's Kontinental Hockey League .
With his terrific shot , deft passing ability and willingness to roam into high - traffic areas around the net , Hudler accumulated career highs in goals ( 23 ) and points ( 57 ) in 2008 - 09 .
It prompted the Russian club to offer him a two - year , $ 10 million ( tax - free ) deal , far more than he would have earned in the NHL .
Dynamo's merger with another club paved the way for his release from the second year of the contract .
" He realized money is n't ( as ) important as wanting to go back to where he likes it , '' Svoboda said .
" He missed the NHL , he missed the Red Wings organization and the guys .
" He 's thrilled to go back .
He had such a great experience ( in Detroit ) . ''
Hudler has a two - year contract with the Red Wings with a salary - cap hit of $ 2.875 million , a deal both sides agreed to before their arbitration hearing last summer .
" The exciting part for me is we know what we 're getting , '' Holland said .
" He 's really coming into the prime of his career .
I think we 're getting a very motivated player .
" He 's a popular guy in the locker room , a bit of a clubhouse clown .
His teammates like him . ''
Red Wings players , like Holland , favor any move that makes the team better .
" He 's got great hands , sees the ice real well , '' Detroit captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
" He can score a goal or make that pass to win a game for you . ''
Said Johan Franzen : " He 's a game - breaker .
Really good hands , good hockey sense .
Showed last year in the playoffs he can come up with really huge plays when we need it . ''
Hudler is not eligible to return in this year 's playoffs .
With Hudler in the fold , the Red Wings have 14 players signed for next season at a salary cap number of $ 43.6 million : forwards Pavel Datsyuk , Henrik Zetterberg , Valtteri Filppula , Dan Cleary , Kris Draper , Franzen and Hudler ; defensemen Brian Rafalski , Brad Stuart , Niklas Kronwall , Jonathan Ericsson and Jakub Kindl ; and goaltenders Chris Osgood and Jimmy Howard .
Holland said the $ 56.8 million salary cap likely will rise slightly .
He said Hudler 's return wo n't significantly effect the team 's decisions on which free agents to re-sign .

Lesson # 615 - Similarities to Blood Donors
The Red Cross likes my blood .
I mean , they REALLY like my blood .
Once they realized I was mistyped as a kid and am O - negative , not AB - positive , and once they realized that my blood sinks like lead when they test for iron content , they started calling me endlessly to get me to donate as often as I can .
If there was n't a mandatory safety period in between each donation , I think they 'd try to get me to donate every day .
It makes me feel like such a blood whore .
Talking about blood donors brings up some interesting , amusing , and disappointing stats and information .
First of all , only a third of blood donors who give once will ever give again .
If you 're ever hurting in terms of income , but still want to make a charitable donation of some kind , blood donating is a pretty good solution .
Secondly , if they REALLY like your blood , you might get asked to donate double red cells , where they take your blood , run it through a centrifuge to separate out the plasma , and then actually inject your plasma BACK INTO YOUR VEIN .
And because the plasma has been sitting out at room temperature while in the centrifuge , you actually get a mild freezing sensation in your arm while you 're focusing on the tubes , ready to grab and squeeze if it looks like an air bubble can get anywhere near your arm .
The science and details of this type of blood donation is amazing enough that it kind of makes donating doubly worth it .
Finally , and most importantly , you may not know that the FDA currently has a ban preventing gay males from donating blood if they have ever had sex with another male .
Ever .
All it takes is once , and your blood is apparently polluted permanently .
I mention this not only because it 's ridiculous and disappointing and stupid , but also because too often the Red Cross gets blamed for the ban when the FDA is actually at fault .
( I was kind of angrily making some comments about it on Twitter on Friday , only to have someone from the Red Cross point out that I 'd been mistaken all this time .
That 's fine , but if they were more vocal about their opposition to the ban , the misperception would n't be so common . )
I know there 's a great deal of disagreement about homosexuality in our culture , but overturning a ban on blood donations is incredibly different than changing marriage laws .
There are so few people donating blood today , and we 're preventing an entire group from being able to contribute when the world really needs more blood donations .
Recently a group of U.S. senators have begun addressing the possibility of overturning the ban , which is certainly a step in the right direction .
But it 's another sign of discrimination in our society that , frankly , is honestly hurting society in ways that few people can argue with .
So let 's make sure everyone is properly informed about the issues , alright ?
The world needs blood donations - perhaps it would be possible to build on other gay rights by pushing for ones that would be extremely difficult to form a religious argument against .
I do n't know . . . but it 's certainly something to think about .
When the topic of flying saucers comes up , someone inevitably talks about the government 's secret installation in the Nevada desert called Area 51 .
The base has been public knowledge for a long time , though I suspect a lot of folks heard about it through the movie " Independence Day " .
The idea is that the alien spaceships that crashed at Roswell New Mexico and other sites were carted off to Area 51 , and the technology there examined and reverse engineered to create a lot of modern tech today .
You can just guess what I think of this theory .
But I 'll spell it out : it 's nonsense .
Yes , Area 51 exists , but the idea that we keep alien tech there is pretty silly .
First , all our technology has a clear line of antecedents ; the transistor , velcro , smart metals , and so on did n't just pop up ex nihilo as some UFO enthusiasts claim .
Second , we have a simpler and more logical line of reasoning here .
We know that the military has a black budget to create advanced tech .
They do n't want our enemies to know what 's going on , and the Nevada desert is pretty isolated .
When the news came out that a base was out there , of course the government 's first line of defense is to deny it .
When the rumors and evidence pile up , they admit it exists , but wo n't say what it 's for .
Of course they do n't !
That 's kinda the point of it being a secret .
And we know that advanced tech comes from the military ; the SR 71 Blackbird is an incredible piece of engineering , and it was designed in the 1960s .
Stealth tech can be thought of in a similar way , and it 's decades old as well .
They are clearly designing amazing stuff at Area 51 and perhaps other locations , and this is exactly the sort of hardware that we need to keep secret .
Like it or not , there are bad guys out there who would love to see America fall , and this kind of technology helps prevent that from happening .
Jumping from that to harboring aliens and their flying saucers is a wee bit of jump of logic .
Of course , I have said for years that I 'm sure the government loves the UFO rumors , since it takes the pressure off the real secrets there .
And so it goes : an article in the Statesman corroborates that view .
Several Area 51 vets have come out and discussed recently declassified information .
My favorite bit is at the very end :
[ Area 51 radar specialist ]
Barnes thinks the Air Force and the CIA did n't mind the stories about alien spacecraft .
They helped cover up the real secret planes that were being tested .
Ya think ?
Anyway , while I may not be happy with everything that supposedly goes on at Area 51 , I can be reasonably -- stress the word reasonably -- sure that it involves stuff developed right here on good old planet Earth .
Tip o' the tin foil beanie to James Oberg .
Amazon Prime Day 2020 date : when is it and what are the best deals to look out for ?
EBay Inc. said Wednesday its first - quarter profit rose 11 percent as consumers spent more on its main website , but a disappointing forecast for the current quarter pushed the company 's shares down sharply in after - hours trading .
EBay said it earned $ 397.7 million , or 30 cents per share , in the first quarter , compared with $ 357.1 million , or 28 cents per share , in the same period of 2009 .
Excluding one - time items , the company earned 42 cents per share .
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 41 cents .
Revenue climbed 9 percent to $ 2.2 billion , matching analyst estimates .
That reflected an improvement in eBay 's biggest segment , which includes eBay.com , Shopping.com and other e-commerce sites .
The company has been sprucing up its main site in hopes of attracting and keeping more shoppers .
That has included rejigging its search and feedback system and starting a buyer - protection program in the U.S. and U.K .
" We 're making steady , solid progress , " said eBay CEO John Donahoe in an interview .
Indeed , marketplace revenue rose 13 percent to $ 1.39 billion .
Sales of fixed - price " Buy it Now " items and the acquisition of South Korea 's Gmarket contributed to the jump in revenue , eBay said .
EBay , based in San Jose , said the number of active registered users on its site rose just 1 percent from last year to 89.5 million .
But its gross merchandise volume , which counts the value of all the items sold on eBay , excluding vehicles , rose 24 percent to $ 13.4 billion .
RBC Capital Markets analyst Stephen Ju said he was satisfied with eBay 's quarter , saying the company showed " incremental progress " as it improves its marketplaces business .
" It 's always going to be slow ... progress to turn a large e-commerce property like eBay around , " he said .
Revenue from eBay 's payments business , which includes PayPal and a short - term credit service called Bill Me Later , jumped 26 percent to $ 809.3 million .
Total payment volume shot up 35 percent to $ 21.3 billion .
This business has grown rapidly as more consumers and merchants use it to send money online , on eBay and on other sites .
EBay CEO John Donahoe believes that in the next few years this business ' revenue will surpass that of eBay 's marketplace .
For the current quarter , eBay forecast an adjusted profit of 37 cents to 39 cents per share on $ 2.15 billion to $ 2.20 billion in revenue .
Analysts had been expecting 40 cents per share on revenue of $ 2.21 billion .
EBay chief financial officer Bob Swan explained during a call with analysts that the company is expecting a stronger dollar to hurt its results .
When the dollar is stronger , transactions in other currencies translate into fewer dollars .
The company kept its full - year forecast , though , which it issued when it gave its fourth - quarter report earlier this year .
EBay shares fell $ 2.12 , or 8.1 percent , in after - hours trading , to $ 24.14 .
They finished regular trading at $ 26.29 , down 11 cents .
WASHINGTON 
In an election year dominated by health care , dozens of candidates for Congress have a catchy campaign slogan at their disposal : Send a doctor to the House .
Forty - seven physicians — 41 Republicans and six Democrats — are running for the House or Senate this year , three times the number of doctors serving in Congress today , according to a USA TODAY review .
An influx of doctors to Congress could alter the landscape for future debates over Medicare and rising insurance premiums months after lawmakers approved President Obama 's 10 - year , $ 938 billion health care law .
Physician candidates start with at least one political advantage : voter confidence .
A Gallup Poll in March found 77 % of Americans trust doctors to do " the right thing " on health policy , compared with 32 % for Republican leaders and 49 % for Obama .
" Physicians just have a different mind - set toward problem solving , " said Larry Bucshon , a Republican heart surgeon running for a House seat in Indiana .
" It 's very good training for being a congressman . "
ELECTION CALENDAR :
See primaries in your state
Most of the candidates are touting their profession on the campaign trail .
Nan Hayworth , a Republican running for a New York House seat , posts a copy of her medical degree on her website .
Ami Bera , a Democratic House candidate from California , told supporters , " My whole adult life has been given to the task of caring for others . "
" We 're trained as physicians to lead by listening , " said Bera , who supports the new health care law but worries it wo n't do enough to lower costs .
Zach Knowling , a spokesman for state Rep. Trent Van Haaften , a Democrat running against Bucshon , said his opponent " continues to side with big insurance companies , " despite his background .
Van Haaften is a former prosecutor .
The political arm of the American Medical Association does n't track how many doctors run in primaries but reports that 30 physicians ran in the 2008 general election compared with 22 in 2006 .
Sen . Tom Coburn , R - Okla. , a doctor and opponent of the health care law , said more physician input may have led to a better law .
" The physician perspective was ignored during the last year and a half , " he said .
There are 16 doctors in Congress today , 3 % of lawmakers .
Doctors made up nearly 5 % of Congress during its first century , said Thomas Suarez , a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist in Baltimore who studied the issue .
" There are a lot of physicians who are incredibly frustrated with the way medicine is today , " Suarez said .
" A very small , though growing number want to make a change . "
Three of the anecdotes around which David Cameron built his case in the debate became the subject of questioning and raised eyebrows , as reporters , bloggers and Twitter users launched their own factchecking operations .
The £ 73,000 police Lexus
Cameron claimed that he had visited a police station in Hull where they " had five different police cars , and they were just about to buy a £ 73,000 Lexus " .
His accusation drew a sharp response from Tim Hollis , chief constable of Humberside police , who said the Tory leader was wrong on two counts : the Lexus IS - F had been bought over a year ago and had n't cost £ 73,000 .
" The bulk of our fleet are general patrol vehicles made by Proton which are economic to buy and run , " Hollis said .
But specialist units needed hi-spec vehicles .
" They are driven at speed and the safety of the public and our officers is of paramount importance .
The Lexus in question was bought for use by our highly successful roads crime section over a year ago . "
The police had paid below the list price , which was in any case £ 53,000 .
A Conservative spokesman said : " If Hull police in fact managed to purchase their Lexus for a smaller sum then they are to be congratulated . "
The black man from Plymouth
" I was in Plymouth recently and a 40 - year - old black man actually made the point to me , " Cameron recalled at the debate .
" He said : ' I came here when I was six , I served in the Royal Navy for 30 years , I 'm incredibly proud of my country , but I am so ashamed that we have had this out of control system with people abusing it so badly . ' "
This , Cameron 's critics swiftly noted , would have made the anonymous man just 10 years old when he joined the service in 1980 .
When Cameron addressed an audience in Plymouth on 8 April at a community college the Plymouth Herald said he was " asked by a man who had emigrated to Britain 45 years ago and had served in the UK armed forces : ' When are we going to look after the British people ? ' "
Assuming these two unidentified men are one and the same , this would mean Cameron 's 10 - year - old naval recruit had somehow managed to emigrate to Britain five years before being born .
One sardonic comment on Twitter summed up the widespread reaction : " There are no black men in Plymouth , " observed Chris Terry .
" I live here . "
In fact , 2001 census data suggests there may be around 450 people in the Plymouth unitary authority area who describe themselves as black – about 0.19 % of the population .
None has yet identified themselves as Cameron 's interlocutor .
The Crosby killing
Cameron had been in Crosby " the other day " , he said , " and I was talking to a woman there who had been burgled by someone who had just left prison and he stole everything in her house and , as he left , he set fire to the sofa and her son died from the fumes and that burglar , that murderer , could be out in four - and - a - half years . "
He was referring to the killing , in March 2008 , of Ryan Dugdale , 21 , by Liam O'Brien .
The crime actually took place in Anfield , causing angry calls to the Crosby Herald after the debate from people who felt Cameron was unfairly branding Crosby – part of the new Lib Dem - Tory marginal seat of Sefton Central – as a dangerous place .
" I do n't mind anecdotal evidence , but they 've got to get their facts right , " a local Lib Dem councillor , Jack Colbert , said .
Now , have you ever watched your dog make a bee - line for a patch of sunlight and lie there contented ?
It ’s a straightforward act , though not an apparently evident one , bringing swift gratification .
Animals simplify things , which is sometimes what we all need to do .
Two of the animals selected for the new campaign are elephants and frogs .
One image is of an elephant perched on a surf board , tail curling up and trunk down , with the tagline reading , “ Who says you ca n’t be big and nimble ? ”
Another shows an airborne frog soaring over three others and says , “ Play quantum leapfrog . ”
The ads , which rolled out in January , are playful , clever , compelling — and without Woods ’ infidelities we ’d still be staring at him in a bunker .
Makes you think .
I asked Alex Pachetti , senior director for communications at Accenture , about lessons learned .
He e-mailed me : “ Have a plan in place for potential scenarios .
Gather facts to make the decision .
Take swift action . ”
Sounds simple .
But it ’s not .
Letting go is hard , as newspaper companies can testify .
The U.S. auto industry got itself into a great big hole by clinging to the outmoded and failing to notice that a lot of the world was getting fired up about creating a low - carbon economy .
“ All great truths begin as blasphemies , ” George Bernard Shaw observed .
And a lot of great products , like most of what Steve Jobs has created , begin by being “ impossible . ”
So I ’m grateful to Woods for tossing his little grenade and getting Accenture to turn on a dime .
Creative churn is the American way .
Woods is not the first guy to let power and money go to his head and he wo n’t be the last .
He ’s had to think again and so have we .
That ’s not so bad .
This is the land of second — and seventh — chances .
As it happens , I ’d read an interview in 2009 with Accenture ’s chief executive , William Green , a plumber ’s son , conducted by my colleague Adam Bryant .
It stuck in my mind because Green seemed so sane .
He said three things matter for managers .
“ The first is competence — just being good at what you do , whatever it is , and focusing on the job you have , not on the job you think you want to have .
The second one is confidence .
People want to know what you think .
So you have to have enough desirable self - confidence to articulate a point of view .
The third is caring . ”
And before you know it , you ’ve got quantum leapfrog .
Funny , I ’ve found myself wondering in airports what grenade might induce HSBC to change its ad campaign .
I know it ’s a great bank and the world ’s local bank and all that , but if I have to look at another of those “ leader - follower - follower - leader ” ads ( guy in suit / guy in jeans / guy in suit / guy in jeans ) — or their numberless equivalents imparting the earth - shattering info that we all think differently — I might just follow my dog to a patch of sunlight and stay there .
The first trinity : the Commodore PET , the Radio - Shack TRS - 80 , and the Apple ] [ ( 1977 -1980 )
Despite the success of the Altair , the big computer companies still considered these small machines to be the domain of a few slightly screwy enthusiasts , and not a product for the mass market .
This did n't stop many of these same enthusiasts from starting their own computer companies , almost all of which no longer exist today .
There was Processor Technology 's Sol , designed by Lee Felsenstein who went on to design the first " portable " computer , the Osborne 1 .
There was Cromemco , which was started by two Stanford students , and made add - on boards for the Altair before designing their own computer products .
Vector Graphic also started making S - 100 memory boards before introducing their own computer system .
A company called IMSAI built an Altair clone and had the distinction of having the first personal computer ever to be featured in a movie , Wargames , before imploding due to overexpansion and forced est training for management that distorted fiscal realities .
SouthWest Technical Products ( SWTP ) built a machine using Motorola 's new 6800 CPU .
In the UK , the NASCOM - 1 kit attempted to mirror the success of the Altair on the other side of the Atlantic .
By the end of 1976 , over 40,000 personal computers had been sold , with MITS selling approximately 25 % , IMSAI 17 % , Processor Technology 8 % , and SWTP 8 % .
There were dozens of other companies selling computers .
Many of them sold too few products to even show up on the radar .
In ten months , Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had managed to sell only 175 units of the hand - assembled Apple I motherboard , which lacked a keyboard , monitor , or even a case .
From left to right : a Vector Graphic , SOL - 20 , SWTP 6800 .
Bottom row : NASCOM -1 , Apple I , Cromenco Z - 2 , IMSAI 8080
The stage was set for the a second , more professional , group of electronics companies to introduce their own products .
The
holy trinity : Commodore PET , TRS - 80 Model I , and the Apple ] [
The first of these was a calculator firm called Commodore , which was started as a typewriter repair company in 1954 by Auschwitz survivor Jack Tramiel .
When Texas Instruments started their price war that nearly drove MITS out of business , Tramiel realized that it was vital for his company to own semiconductor technology that could produce chips in - house , just like TI did .
He found ex-Motorola engineer Chuck Peddle , who had invented a vastly cheaper 6800 clone called the 6502 .
Commodore bought Peddle 's company , MOS Technologies , and let him continue working on his own projects .
One of these projects became the PET computer , ostensibly standing for Personal Electronic Transactor , but Commodore engineers sometimes called it Peddle 's Ego Trip after it wound up becoming a smash success .
The PET had its own built - in monitor , keyboard , and tape drive , giving early computer users everything they needed to start working .
It even had a version of BASIC purchased from Bill Gates ' tiny Micro - Soft company .
The keyboard was a cheap " Chiclet " job that was replaced in later models .
Commodore sold 4,000 PETs in 1978 and sales kept rising .
A base model PET sold for US$ 795 .
Elsewhere , the electronics chain Radio Shack decided that they should get into the personal computer business .
Their Tandy - Radio Shack 80 , or TRS - 80 ( known to some computer hobbyists as a " Trash - 80 , " in the first of many platform flamewars to come ) was available in modular form , with the keyboard and computer selling for US$ 399 , the black and white display for US $ 199 , and a cassette storage system for US $ 49 .
The main advantage that Radio Shack had over the others was their built - in distribution system .
Each of their 3,000 stores was given a single TRS - 80 to sell , but within a month the company had over 10,000 orders .
The lowly TRS - 80 quickly became the top - selling personal computer of the trinity , as new models enhanced its capabilities .
The final computer of the trinity was made by the only company to survive into the modern age as a computer company .
The Apple ] [ was a refined version of the Apple I motherboard , with added color , memory capacity , eight expansion slots , and an attractive beige case with a built - in brown keyboard .
It retailed for US $ 1,298 with 4 k of RAM , or US $ 1,698 with 16 k .
Initial sales were sluggish as Apple sold only 600 machines in 1977 , mostly due to the high price compared to the PET and TRS - 80 .
However , with the addition of the fast and relatively inexpensive Disk ] [ floppy drive accessory , made possible by an ingenious disk controller using only eight chips that Wozniak designed , the Apple ] [ sold 7,600 units in the following year and 35,000 in 1979 .
It was still a distant third compared to the other two machines in the trinity , however .
Apple 's response to being in third place involved the genius of Regis McKenna , the former Intel PR executive who had spearheaded " Operation Crush , " the predecessor of the " Intel Inside " campaign .
McKenna decided that what the company needed was great marketing , so all advertising for the Apple ] [ was glossy and rich , and some ads even claimed that the Apple ] [ was the " best - selling personal computer . "
It had nowhere near such status at the time .
What really turned the company around , however , was the release of the first ever " killer app . "
This was VisiCalc , the original spreadsheet application , which was released in 1979 .
The author , Dan Bricklin , wrote it for the Apple ] [ simply because that machine , borrowed from his publisher Dan Fylstra , was the only one he had available .
A combination of great marketing and even better luck propelled the Apple ] [ from an also - ran to a serious contender .
In 1981 the company sold 210,000 units , leaving the PET in the dust and nearly equaling the TRS - 80's numbers .

" We are proud of our record on civil liberties , " says the Labour manifesto without the slightest hint of irony , " and have taken the DNA profiles of children off the database and tightened the rules around the use of surveillance – but we are still determined to keep our streets safe . "
That is the only reference to liberties in the document , which otherwise continues the drumbeat about anti-social behaviour , much of which was enabled by the relaxation in the licensing laws .
The manifesto offers scant hope to those who may have believed Gordon Brown 's reassurances about his respect for liberty and the constitution , and it makes clear that the party is incapable or unwilling to acknowledge the extent to which it has changed the relationship between the individual and the state for the worse .
But those looking for sweeping redress from the Conservative manifesto will be disappointed by the milk and water commitment to civil liberties .
The shadow justice minister Dominic Grieve , good man that he is , has clearly lost the battle to commit his party to an ambitious portmanteau bill that would repeal Labour 's attack on liberty .
However , it is moderately good news that the party commits itself to rolling back the database state – ID cards , the ContactPoint children 's database and the vetting and barring scheme will be scrapped or reduced – curtailing council surveillance powers of local councils , giving more power to the information commissioner , introducing privacy impact assessments on new legislation .
The party does not go far enough on changing the law in respect to the DNA database , and most controversially proposes to replace the Human Rights
Act with a bill of rights .
By far the best undertakings on liberty come in the Liberal Democrat manifesto , which is hardly surprising , given that it has been stalwart in its defence of liberty under all three of its leaders since the last election .
Nick Clegg 's attack on Labour 's authoritarian streak is especially welcome and will be significant if there is a hung parliament on May 7 , which – astonishingly – is what 32 % of voters desire .
The party will introduce a freedom bill , regulate CCTV , reduce local council surveillance , restore the right to protest , protect free speech , offer guarantees to investigative journalism , scrap ID cards , end plans to spy on email and internet connections , scrap ContactPoint , reduce pre-charge detention to 14 days and scrap secret evidence .
The Lib Dems go much further than the Tories on the DNA database and offer wholehearted support for the HRA .
On civil liberties , the Lib Dems win hands down .
But one important question remains : what on earth prevented the Tories from making similar commitments ?
Fear or lack of conviction ?
The core and calculated meme behind her appeal to the Christianist base - allegedly carrying a child to term when others might not - is already being propagated .

You heard that right , people -- iPhone OS 4 just brought multitasking to the platform !
Apple says they 've figured out how to implement third party multitasking without hurting performance or battery life , and they 're demoing it now -- you just double click the home button and see a list of your apps , and you can just tap to switch between apps .
The system actually runs the services apps need in the background -- the apps do n't need to do them individually , so it 's not a " true " multitasking system , but it seems plenty effective .
There are seven services : background audio , which allows you to use the standard pop-over iPod controls , Voice over IP , which can receive calls in the background , location services for GPS and social networking ( there 's an indicator if any service is tracking you ) , updated push notifications with local notifications , task completion so you can finish things like uploads in the background , and fast app switching , which lets apps sleep and resume instantly .
Notably missing ?
Anything for managing a conversation , like IM or Twitter , which is a big omission .
Win some , lose some , we suppose .
Here 's a big " lose some " -- only the iPhone 3GS and 3rd generation ( late 2009 ) iPod touch will support multitasking .
The iPhone 3G and below wo n't --
Steve says the hardware does n't support it .
Sad face .
Chapter Text
I paced about , preening and strutting .
It was only two hours until ribbon cutting .
... Now fifty nine minutes , plus one hour .
The Lorax just stood there , expression dour .
" What 's wrong old chap ? " I said ,
As I gave a soft clap to his old furry head .
" A bright new era is today beginning .
You should n't frown , you should be grinning . "
" I never thought a day would come , "
Said the old Lorax , still quite glum ,
" That I would assist in building a factory .
As tree - speakers go , I 'm quite unsatisfactory . "
" Nonsense ! " said I . " Do n't feel so low .
We both had a point many years ago .
Skies must be blue , and clean water must flow ,
yet business is business , and businesses grow .
Look at what 's happened , in a world without thneeds .
People buy many more garments to meet all their needs .
There are lots more factories both big and small ,
but our new establishment replaces them all --
Duck farms filling pillows , cobblers cobbling cleats ,
farmers felling willows to plant flax fields to make sheets ,
companies crocheting curtains , knitters knitting napkins ,
shirt makers for certain , and milliners with their hat pins .
But this factory here , you silly goose ,
makes a product specifically meant for reuse !
And its brilliant design is all thanks to you !
This factory makes the world have _less_ trash goo .
We built atop landfill , and who thanks us for that ?
The brown bar - ba - loots , from whom we took no habitat .
We 're powered by sunlight and wind , by natural gas
That comes from the landfill 's decomposing morass .
And remember new chum , the best part of all ,
is that our raw materials come from that Pacific trash ball .
We 've planned well and we 've fulfilled all of your wishes ,
and our thneed - making now cleans the home of the fishes .
I am sorry , my friend , how we got such a bad start ,
but now ca n't we agree , that business can be smart ? "
The Lorax gave a sigh , then he gave a slight smile .
" I suppose I 'll get used to it , in a little while .
I must say I 'm happy that some profits from these thneeds
are going to the planting of truffula seeds .
But we must not let success and profit 's great appeals
ever let us forget our earthly core ideals . "
" Of course you 're right , stout little friend .
But look -- our wait is at an end .
The words you speak have never been truer .
But it 's time to give the grand opening tour . "
And then I saw a great crowd accrue ,
and right at the front stood Cindy Lou Who .
Our grand opening day had very fine weather ,
And the Lorax and I cut the ribbon together .
In the grand entrance hall
I addressed the great mob .
" Now I 'll tell you all
about the first thneed process job .
Out in the brine off the coast of Waikiki
our fleet is at work making the seas squeaky
clean with a wondrous boat I call the goo - gitcher - snatch .
It 's the greatest new thing for gobbling up trash .
Twelve gitcher - snatch boats feed three gitcher - snatch ships ,
which bring junk to the shore on rotating shifts .
While in the ship 's hold , the gook starts to mold .
By the time it hits shore , it 's turned into a gruel ,
and the slime near the floor makes a great truck fuel .
Fueled with gruel and filled with old swill ,
our trucks filled with junk drive over hill
over dale and down valley
then into this alley --"
Then I pointed through a great window pane
to the row of trash trucks filling the lane .
" But these loads of trash are the greatest of loot !
Let 's see what happens once they go down the chute . "
The crowd trickled down in groups and in pairs ,
down to the basement , down the great stairs .
" And here , " I said , " Is the filth - filter - foo .
It filters trash solids out of the goo .
The trash solids head up this big conveyor belt ,
with lamps overhead to make melty things melt .
The chunks get dumped into my big - bit - blitzer .
What does it do ?
It makes little bits , sir .
It makes the big bits tiny and wee ,
and they rejoin the goo in device number three .
Three is the boiler , it boils the mixture
and squeezes it into this pasta - mold fixture .
The boiling sanitizes , denatures , and cleans .
It converts into oxides harmful alkenes .
Then once we 've got a uniformly thick paste ,
we squeeze it out with speed and with haste .
As soon as it's ready it 's turned into spaghetti .
The strands are strewn down this ramp to this oven
where they get nicely dried , then they get some more lovin ' .
Now follow me into room number four ,
with the grand brushing - felting plush - belting floor .
Here the dry strands are brushed out all thin
As combs dart out , dart back , and dart in .
On the mish - misher - mat they get all hammered flat .
They 're clipped , twisted , and twined into thin strands of felt ,
then brushed into softness as they head off on that belt .
The belt leads to the thneedlery , a place very secret ,
and no one may see by what pattern a thneed 's knit .
But you special guests just now may peer low
down through these grates to see thneed ground zero .
The finest knitting machines ever have I unfurled ,
the fastest contraptions to have knitted or purled .
And now friends let 's come watch the packaging
by this row of devices I call the pack - job -ring .
Each thneed is folded , then tied with itself .
Each thneed is tagged but needs no bag for the shelf .
No fancy little carton , no display case ,
no wasted materials taking up space .
Just one big box for each thneed shipment .
We 're trying real hard to keep things efficient .
Then out to the stores in our goo fueled truck .
Now let me show you what we 'll do with our earned bucks .
The crowd walked out back , and out there to greet 'em
was our brand shining new trufful - arboretum .
Hundreds of saplings lined up in rows ,
All covered in thneeds to protect them from snows .
" Now before you go home and enjoy the rest of this day ,
my co-founder the Lorax has something to say . "
" Hello , " said the Lorax , " It 's been good to meet you ,
to come back and to be able to greet you .
We 've got a great factory , none could be keener .
It does n't pollute , it 's a trash cleaner .
The thneed 's a clever thing : a towel , a washcloth , a dress .
But none of this will mean anything , unless --
Unless we all remember each day
to cherish earth 's worth in every way .
Just this one factory is n't enough .
We must change them all , though it 'll be tough .
The thneed 's not enough , though it 's great for clothes .
We must change cars , toys , and how food grows .
We need fewer whistles and bells .
What we need is to change ourselves .
We can't let sprawling towns get so out of hand .
The bar - ba - loots need their wild land !
Yet today is not the day for such words of woe .
It is a happy day , and I 'll say before I go ,
that I 'm proud our old Once-ler has learned
that there 's more to life than what we 've earned .
And I 'm glad to say that he taught me a thing or two
about how business is n't all bad , it depends what you do .
But now I must travel , to places high and low .
Thank you ,
Once-ler , for showing me that people do grow . "
And with that he lifted himself up by his seat
and vanished in the haze of the summer heat .
The crowd 's gaze followed him as away he flew .
There was just one more thing I had to do .
From out of the crowd I called up a young fellow .
He looked quite nervous , his face turning yellow .
" Let 's applaud this young man for his great deeds .
It was he who planted the last truffula seeds .
Not a tree in the trufful - arboretum would be here without his work
to pot , sprout , and peat them , and never to shirk ,
to give them fresh water , feed them fresh air .
Those last few seeds , he gave them great care .
And now my young friend , when these trees are full grown ,
I 've got a new job for you , all for your own .
You were the ' Unless , ' and you 've shown great vim and great nerve .
And I 'd like you to run a wildlife preserve .
We 'll replant them all among the old truffula stumps .
We 'll plant them in patches , copses , and clumps .
We 'll bring back the landscape to what it once was .
As humming fish hum and bumble bees buzz ,
the swamy - swans can all come back to nest
and the bar - ba - loots eat the fruit they like best . "
The chap flashed a grin as he shook my hand
and he looked out with hope across the land .
He stepped to the microphone , the crowd to address ,
and he said these five words , " Remember .
_ You_ are the Unless . "
BOLINAS , Calif. — Marc Dwaileebe would like to build a house for his family on land he owns in this bucolic town just 20 miles north of San Francisco .
But he cannot hook up to the water main that runs right past his property unless he has a water meter .
And a water meter , in Bolinas , could cost more than $ 300,000 .
That is the minimum bid for a meter being auctioned off through Friday .
The auction is the unlikely result of a water meter moratorium imposed by antidevelopment forces here in 1971 .
For most of the last 39 years , “ the only way a water meter came free was when a house burnt down , or fell off a cliff , ” said Barbara Rothwell , a longtime Bolinas resident .
The meter moratorium has survived , even through protracted litigation , with the support of residents who like this isolated town the way it is .
Speaking of Walter Peck , the Onion ’s AV Club featured William Atherton in this week ’s Random Roles – it ’s an interview that is guided by and specifically about the actor ’s roles over the years .
Ghostbusters , as you ’d expect , features prominently – both the movie and the video game .
You can , and should , read the whole article here .
Ghostbusters ( 1984 ) — “ Walter Peck ”
WA : I had finished doing a Broadway gig , and I was out here .
I met with Dan [ Aykroyd ] , and I talked a bit .
Gilda Radner and I had done George Abbott ’s Broadway together , so we were all kind of aware of each other .
So when this happened , they asked me to do it , and I said fine , but as I ’ve said many times , I said , “ What do you want me to — I ca n’t compete with you guys being funny .
That ’s insane . ”
So Ivan [ Reitman ] and I talked , and I said , “ I ’ve got to be a male Margaret Dumont .
I just do n’t know why it ’s funny , you know ?
It ca n’t be funny , and I do n’t find them in the least bit charming .
I have to be outraged . ”
And that ’s what we did .
AVC : How much was your part written ?
WA : It was all written .
There would be riffs and [ Bill ]
Murray would go off , and he ’d improvise , and you would have to follow him , which was great .
Like the mayor ’s office — a lot of that scene is improvised .
Bill was great .
He ’d kind of throw it all out there , and you ’d kind of pick it up and throw it .
That ’s what you do with Murray .
AVC : That seems like it would be a pretty grueling shoot .
Was it ?
WA : I did n’t have that .
I had a perfectly good time .
I thought part of it was grueling in New York , when they were on Central Park West and 66th Street .
It was really tough for them .
You ’re closing it all off to shoot a movie .
It ’s New York ; it ’s not Indianapolis .
You have a lot of severely ticked people when that happens .
So they had a lot of it , but I did n’t .
AVC : Not even when you got all the shaving cream dumped on you ?
WA : We had the eighth - grade science test .
I went under the bag , and I asked , “ How much shaving cream is in there ? ”
And they said , “ Not that much . ”
So I said , “ Well , how much does it weigh ? ” “ It ’s about 75 pounds , but it ’s shaving cream . ”
“ You know the whole thing about 75 pounds of feathers and 75 pounds of lead ?
It ’s about the same thing .
[ Laughs . ]
So can we figure out what ’s going to happen with this ? ”
So they put some poor stunt guy underneath to show the sissy actor “ Okay , nothing ’s going to happen . ”
So they unleashed it , and it flattened him .
So they took out half of the shaving cream , and I went in very happily and was slimed .
AVC : That ’s such a big part , probably the one people most associate with you .
WA : That and the Die Hards .
I think it ’s the picture that anybody who ’s in it is associated with more than anything else , including Murray and Aykroyd and everybody .
If you think about one movie with any of them , it ’s Ghostbusters , and I ’m not different from anybody else in that movie .
The movie became enormous .
We knew it was going to be big , but it was a culture shift .
It ’s just like getting hit by the bus , there .
AVC : What did you have to do to reprise that role for the videogame ?
WA : Oh , it ’s great .
You get paid a lot of money to sit in a room for about two hours ; all you do is go “ Oh ! ” “ Ah ! ” “ Uh ! ” I can do that for you again , but it will cost you a great deal of money .
Is Roland Emmerich really going to adapt Isaac Asimov 's Foundation books ?
Maybe , but he 's doing another movie first .
And he 's making the writer rewrite the script so the movie will have " a hero " and " a bad guy . "
Minor spoilers ahead .

Emmerich is going ahead with his next movie project —
Anonymous , which is based on the longstanding theory that Shakespeare 's plays were actually written by the 17th Earl Of Oxford .
He already has Vanessa Redgrave , David Thewlis and Rhys Ifans signed up to star .
So what about Foundation ?
Emmerich tells Empire Magazine that he might do the Asimov adaptation after Anonymous , but it depends on the script , which is currently being written by his The Patriot screenwriter , Robert Rodat .
He says the script is " 240 pages long !
I said , ‘ You know what guys ?
Edit it down to at least under 200 pages . ' "

But he adds that he 's enthusiastic about the material , which he wants to do entirely in CG and 3 - D motion - capture :
I 'm really into it .
I worked with Bob on the story for weeks , sitting in a room trying to figure out how to make all the loose stories [ work ] and put them in a box called ‘ Foundation ' .
Bob 's perfect for this thing - he also knows as a writer he has to find the hero and a bad guy in the piece .
We had to come up with characters that go through [ the series ] , which is very hard .

So are you more horrified by Emmerich 's description of his ideas for a Foundation script , or more relieved that he 's not going to get to it any time soon ?

However , you can still apply for an invitation .
We are grateful to Professor Richard Dawkins for contributing to the ongoing public dialogue about religious faith and contemporary science ( Your Weekend , Feb 27 - 28 ) .
Despite their popularity , however , we believe his views are flawed , and do a disservice to both science and religion .
Scientific knowledge is only provisional .
To claim science can address the ultimate questions of existence is just as much a faith stance as that of religion .
Yet , Mr Dawkins maintains that religion is an old and dangerous obscurantism and that science properly requires atheism .
Many able scientists trust in the methodologies and corrigible findings of science , as well as in the reasoned insights provided by religious faith .
It 's our assertion that faith is critically informed by fact .
Many religious claims are underpinned by historical and scientific disciplines .
And the central claim that all things known and unknown in our universe originate from the purposive actions of a creator is , we believe , totally consistent with what we know about the universe .
We affirm our commitment to both scientific and religious knowledge and contend , against Professor Dawkins ' " scientism " , that both scientific and religious knowledge are intelligible , mutually informing , life - promoting , and of great public benefit .

Churton Park [ abridged ]
In September 2009 I submitted an article to the feminist journal Women ’s Studies International Forum , and in February 2010 I was informed that the journal had decided against publication .
Nothing unusual in that , of course .
No doubt the great majority of articles submitted to journals are rejected , for a multitude of reasons .
But when I enquired why no reason had been given , the Editor - in - Chief replied that the paper had not been sent out for review as she did not feel that it had sufficient evidence in terms of references or citations to back up some of the claims that were made .
Now , whatever deficiencies there may have been in the article , insufficient citation was not one of them .
In fact it was profusely referenced , with some sixty citations in an article of approximately 4000 words ( Esterson 2009 ) .
The explanation was clearly spurious .
Perhaps the subject matter , a critique of claims made in a Reader in Feminist Science Studies concerning the supposed contributions made by Einstein ’s first wife to his celebrated 1905 papers , was inappropriate for the journal .
Evidently not , as the journal previously published one of the most frequently cited articles on this very same subject : “ Mileva Einstein - Marić : The Woman Who Did Einstein ’s Mathematics ” ( Troemel - Ploetz 1990 ) .
I think we must look elsewhere for the explanation , which will perhaps emerge from an examination of the claims in question .
Women , Science , and Technology : A Reader in Feminist Science Studies ( Wyer 2000 ) contains a chapter by the feminist sociologist Hilary Rose , reprinted from her book Towards a Feminist Transformation of the Sciences : Love , Power and Knowledge ( 1994 ) .
In a section under the subheading “ A dangerous combination of love and science ” ( 1994 , pp. 143-144 ; Wyer 2000 , pp. 56 - 57 )
Rose purports to demonstrate that Einstein ’s first wife , Mileva Marić , made substantial contributions to his early scientific achievements , and that the failure to give her work due recognition exemplifies “ the unbridled patriarchal power of appropriation ” in the “ early twentieth century scientific labour market ” .
In the Introduction to the Reader in Feminist Science Studies , under the subheading “ Scientific Behavior and the Scientific Method ” the editors write : “ In using the scientific method , it is assumed that scientists will adhere to a number of behavioral norms …
They contain the essence , or spirit , of scientific enquiry … ” ( Wyer 2000 , p. xix ) .
Among five “ scientific norms ” the editors go on to list is that of “ scepticism ( all claims should be scrutinized for errors ) . ”
This should , of course , be an essential feature of all scholarly writings , and here I want to examine whether Rose ’s historical contentions about Mileva Marić comply with to this exemplary precept .
After a very brief introduction in which she cites a biography of Marić by the Serbian author Desanka Trbuhović - Gjurić ( 1993 [ 1988 ] ) , Rose writes that the marriage was initially happy and mutually appreciative , exemplified by Einstein ’s “ explain[ing ] to a group of Zagreb intellectuals that he needed his wife as ‘ she solves all the mathematical problems for me ’ . ”
Now one might have thought that the contention that Einstein ’s first wife solved all his mathematical problems for him is something that required further investigation before endorsement .
However , Rose is content to take the claim at face value .
From her endnotes it is evident that she has not examined the biography she has cited , but relies on Troemel - Ploetz ’s 1990 article for the information she is relaying ( Rose 1994 , p. 271 , n.19 ; Wyer 2000 , p. 66 , n.9 ) .
Had Rose consulted Trbuhović - Gjurić ’s book she would have found that the “ Zagreb intellectuals ” were actually young comrades and friends of Marić ’s medical student brother Miloš ( 1993 , p. 93 ) .
Moreover , she would have seen that Trbuhović - Gjurić provides no reference for the quotation , nor even a specific occasion , so we are left to take the assertion on trust , something only too characteristic of the biography .
Trbuhović - Gjurić ’s evidence for such statements comes mostly third hand from friends and acquaintances of the Maric family obtained some sixty years after the events in question .
Hometown folklore gathered from interested parties in such circumstances hardly constitutes reliable testimony .
One might have hoped that Rose would at least have made some attempt to ascertain whether the claim is tenable .
Had she done so she would have found that whereas Einstein excelled in the mathematics he required in the early stages of his scientific career , it was Marić ’s poor grade in the mathematical component ( theory of functions ) of her Zurich Polytechnic final teaching diploma examination ( 2.5 on a scale 1 - 6 ) that resulted in her failing the exam in 1900 ( Albert Einstein Collected Papers , Vol. 1 , 1987 , doc. 67 ) .
Furthermore , the mathematics required for the 1905 papers to which Rose alludes in the following paragraph is not at a level that would have taxed Einstein ’s mathematics abilities ( Esterson 2006 ) .
Rose now goes on to describe what she calls “ two key episodes ” that “ document the process by which [ Marić ’s ] work , if not actively appropriated , was certainly lost to [ Einstein ] ” .
She reports that “ Mileva , through the collaboration with a mutual friend , Paul Habicht , constructed an innovatory device for measuring electrical currents .
Having built the device the two inventors left it to Einstein to describe and patent … ”
Here Rose is paraphrasing Troemel - Ploetz ( p. 418 ) , who in turn is quoting Trbuhović - Gjurić ( 1993 , p. 83 ) .
But Trbuhović - Gjurić provides not a single reference to justify her assertions , and the only documents pertaining to this episode tell a very different story .
There are around twenty letters exchanged between Einstein and one or other of the Habicht brothers ( Conrad and Paul ) in the years 1907 - 1911 in which the “ little machine ” ( Maschinchen ) is discussed , but there is no mention of any contribution from Marić ( Collected Papers , Vol. 5 , 1995 ) .
The development of the device for measuring small currents is well documented from the time Einstein reported his ideas for a new method of measuring very small quantities of electrical energy in a letter to Conrad and Paul Habicht dated 15 July 1907 ( Fölsing 1997 , pp. 239-241 ) .
( He had suggested the possibility of such a device in the final paragraph of a paper published in Annalen der Physik earlier that year [ Collected Papers , Vol. 2 , 1989 , doc. 39 ] . )
Einstein and Conrad had become close friends since Einstein had moved to Bern in 1902 , before his marriage the following year .
Paul Habicht had started up a small instrument - making company in 1907 , and used his laboratory for making and improving the device .
There are nine letters from Paul to Einstein giving details of stages in the manufacture of the device , not one of which suggests that Marić was involved .
At the end of three of these Paul adds conventional greetings to Einstein ’s family , but he refers to “ your wife ” , not Mileva as one would expect if they had been working closely together in the way that Trbuhović - Gjurić claims .
( In one letter to Einstein , dated 12 October 1908 , Paul specifically refers to “ your machine ” . ) [ 1 ]
In summary , the documentary evidence shows that it was Einstein who supplied the scientific knowledge and basic ideas that enabled Paul Habicht to manufacture the Maschinchen .
There is not a single piece of evidence to support Trbuhović - Gjurić ’s account of Marić ’s major role in collaboration with Paul , and she supplies no information to indicate on what basis her contentions rest .
But no matter .
For Rose , this supposed episode illustrates “ that the price of her selfless love … was that her work had become his . ”
( In the next sentence Rose makes the preposterous assertion that Marić “ also lost her personal health through trying to do the mathematical work to support his theorizing and simultaneously take care of their children ” . )
Rose next alludes is what she describes as “ the even more disturbing episode of the articles published in 1905 in the Leipzig Annalen der Physik . ”
She continues :
Of the five key papers , two of the originally submitted manuscripts were signed also by Mileva , but by the time of their publication , her name had been removed .
These two articles , written in what was widely understood as Einstein ’s golden age , included the theory of special relativity which was to change the nature of physics , and for which he alone received the Nobel prize …
For this assertion Rose cites Troemel - Ploetz , who actually refers to three papers that “ were written [ by Einstein ] together with his wife ” – Rose has misread Troemel - Ploetz on this , and also when she erroneously writes that Einstein received the Nobel prize for his special relativity paper ( Troemel - Ploetz 1990 , p. 419 ; Trbuhović - Gjurić 1993 , p. 97 ) .
However , the report by Trbuhović - Gjurić that is paraphrased by Troemel - Ploetz is an object lesson in how not to present an historical contention .
She purports to provide the substance of a passage by the Soviet physicist Abraham Joffe in his article “ In Remembrance of Albert Einstein ” , published in 1955 .
Unfortunately she does not quote Joffe ’s actual words , giving instead a paraphrase that includes the basic contention followed by supporting information that misleadingly reads as if it also came from Joffe .
But the unreferenced supporting evidence is without foundation , as is her basic contention that Joffe stated that ( in Troemel - Ploetz ’s words ) “ the original manuscripts were signed Einstein - Marić ” .
It is impossible in a short space to fully document the errors in Trbuhović - Gjurić ’s contentions about Joffe , but this has been done in meticulous detail by John Stachel in his Introduction to the 1905 edition of Einstein ’s Miraculous Year : Five Papers That Changed the Face of Physics ( Stachel , 2005 , pp. liv-lxxii ) .
As Alberto Martínez also documents , “ Joffe did not claim that Marić co-authored or collaborated in any of Einstein ’s papers .
And he did not claim that her name was on the original manuscripts … ” ( Martínez , 2005 , pp. 51 - 52 ) .
Martínez notes that in multiple places throughout his career Joffe acknowledged Einstein as sole author of the three papers .
More specifically , relevant passages in Joffe ’s book Begegnungen Mit Physikern ( “ Meetings with Scientists ” ) are inconsistent with all of Trbuhović - Gjurić ’s contentions in the section in question ( Joffe 1967 , pp. 23-24 , 92-93 ) .
Rose claims that Stachel ( whose name she gives as “ Hackel ” ) “ disturbingly … ignores the evidence ” contained in Trbuhović - Gjurić ’s biography , indicating that in this context she considers that “ assertions ” is a synonym for “ evidence ” .
In fact Stachel had rebutted the main contentions at a session of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in February 1990 ( Stachel 2002 , pp. 26-38 ) .
It is instructive to compare Rose ’s cavalier attitude to what constitutes “ evidence ” with that of Stachel at that session : “ I must emphasize that bare assertions , particularly by interested parties , do not constitute proof of such assertions , even when these assertions are repeated in print , even in a book ” ( Stachel 2002 , p. 32 ) .
In relation to the claims that she has recycled , Rose contends that Trbuhović - Gjurić ’s biography has “ raised doubts in the scientific community ” , and cites a letter in Physics Today by Evan Harris Walker ( Walker 1989 ; Rose 1994 , p. 271 , n.21 ; Wyer 2000 , p. 66 , n.11 ) .
Now Walker ( who died in 2006 ) had a Ph.D. in physics , but he was hardly representative of the scientific community , having for some time been president of the Walker Cancer Research Institute .
Rose writes that Trbuhović - Gjurić indicates that “ Einstein was the creative thinker ” , but he “ could not have realized his theoretical insights without Mileva ’s mathematics ” .
Leaving aside that only someone ignorant of the subject matter in question could write such scientific nonsense , one is left wondering how Rose can reconcile this statement with Walker ’s contention in relation to the 1905 special relativity paper that “ the background material , and most importantly , those most basic capricious ideas …came from Mileva , while the mathematics and proofs came largely from Albert ” ( Walker 1989 , p. 11 ) .
That two of the original proponents of the thesis that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers can arrive at such opposite conclusions is in itself a measure of the paucity of the evidence on which the claims are based .
Contrary to Rose ’s assertion about “ doubts in the scientific community ” , the historian of physics Gerald Holton and historian Robert Schulmann note that “ All serious Einstein scholarship has shown that the scientific collaboration between the couple was slight and one - sided ” ( Holton and Schulmann 1995 ) .
( See Pais 1994 , pp. 1 - 29 ; Holton 1996 , pp. 170-93 ; Stachel 1996 , pp. 207-219 ; Stachel 2002 , pp. 26-38 ; Martínez 2005 , pp. 49 - 56 . )
As for Walker ’s contribution to the debate , Stachel stated in 1990 : “ I know nothing about cancer research , but if I had to judge Walker solely on the basis of his letter on Einstein , I would have to conclude that he is a fantasist , who judges reality on the basis of his own desires ” ( Stachel 2002 , p. 26 ) .
( See also Esterson 2008 . )
Illustrating the poor level of scholarship to be found in the article on which Rose relies , Troemel - Ploetz asks : “ Why did [ Einstein ] not acknowledge in public that it was [ Marić ] who came up with the idea to investigate ether and its importance ( Trbuhović - Gjuri ć 1983 , p. 76 ) ? ”
The reference is to a passage in Trbuhović - Gjurić ’s biography containing the following quotation purportedly from Einstein :
Mileva believes in my abilities , she believes that I am able to perceive the truths in the processes of nature , regardless of the erroneous beliefs relating to them .
It is she who first directed my attention to the significance of the ether presumed to exist throughout the universe .
( Trbuhović - Gjurić 1993 , p. 87 [ my translation ] ) .
Trbuhović - Gjurić states that Einstein made this statement to Miloš Marić , Mileva ’s brother , supposedly in 1905 .
However , she provides no reference for the quotation , which certainly did n’t come directly from Miloš himself , as he stayed in Russia ( later the Soviet Union ) after being taken prisoner during the First World War , and did n’t return home before his death in 1944 ( Trbuhović - Gjurić 1993 , p. 161 ) .
In any case , we know the assertion in the second sentence is erroneous , as Einstein wrote an essay on the ether when he was only sixteen , before he had even met Marić ( Collected Papers , Vol. 1 , 1987 , doc. 5 ) .
Furthermore , while there is no evidence that Marić had any specific interest in the ether , it was Einstein who wrote to her in August 1899 that he was “ convinced more and more that the electrodynamics of moving bodies as it is presented today does n’t correspond to reality ” , and that the introduction of the term “ ether ” had “ led to the conception of a medium whose motion can be described , without , I believe , being able to ascribe physical meaning to it ” ( Renn and Schulmann 1992 , p. 10 ) .
In another letter the following month , at a time when Marić was revising for examinations , Einstein reported that he had come up “ a good idea for investigating a body ’s relative motion with respect to the luminiferous ether ” , adding : “ But enough of this !
Your poor little head is already crammed with other people ’s hobby horses that you ’ve had to ride ” ( p. 14 ) .
Evidently interest in the ether was Einstein ’s hobby horse , not Marić’s .
That the words that Trbuhović - Gjurić attributes to Einstein contain an assertion that is documentably false serves to illustrate the unreliability of several like claims to be found in her biography .
Where does that leave us ?
A highly regarded feminist sociologist has uncritically reproduced claims about alleged contributions to Einstein ’s celebrated 1905 papers by his first wife on the sole basis of an article which itself is almost entirely based on contentions in a book that fails to comply with the most fundamental scholarly standards .
Trbuhović - Gjurić ’s biography , containing no index or bibliography and almost entirely devoid of reference citations , is described , with justice , by the Einstein biographer Albrecht Fölsing as containing a combination of fictional invention and pseudo documentation ( belletristischer Erfindung und Pseudodokumentation ) ( Fölsing 1990 ) .
It is disappointing to find claims based on such dubious historical evidence further disseminated in a Feminist Science Studies Reader in the Introduction to which the editors enunciate the principle that factual claims should be treated with caution and scrutinized for errors .
That Hilary Rose is by no means alone among feminist academics in failing to comply with this exemplary dictum in regard to Mileva Marić ’s alleged scientific contributions is illustrated by a similarly misleading account by Andrea Gabor , deprecated by Holton and Schulmann for its “ flights of journalistic fantasy ” ( Gabor 1995 , pp. 3 - 32 ; Holton and Schulmann 1995 ; see Esterson 2007 ) .
In their treatment of this subject matter both authors reveal a propensity to endorse claims that are in accord with their preconceptions regardless of the calibre of the purported evidence .
It is perhaps unsurprising that the editors of Women ’s Studies International Forum are reluctant to be a party to revealing information of a nature likely to be unpalatable to many of its readers .
Note
1 It should be noted that , while lending no support to the story of Marić ’s supposed leading role in collaboration with Paul Habicht , the biographer Carl Seelig writes of Einstein ’s and Habicht ’s “ attempts to perfect [ the machine ] with occasional help from Mileva ” ( Seelig 1956 , p. 60 ) .

( Reuters ) - The Obama administration , kicking off an intensive week of nuclear diplomacy , unveiled a revamped policy on Tuesday restricting U.S. use of its atomic weapons stockpile .
A Nuclear Posture Report is required by Congress of every U.S. leader but President Barack Obama had set high expectations when he vowed last year to end “ Cold War thinking ” and setting out a vision for a world free of nuclear weapons .
Following are key elements of the review :
* The United States for the first time is forswearing use of atomic weapons against non-nuclear countries , a break with a Bush - era threat of nuclear retaliation in the event of a biological or chemical attack .
But the policy shift came with the caveat that countries will be spared a U.S. nuclear response only if they are in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
That loophole means nuclear - defiant Iran and North Korea would not be protected .
* “ The United States will not develop new nuclear warheads , ” the document stated .
This appeared to rule out going ahead with Bush - era pursuit of low - yield “ bunker buster ” nuclear bombs to be able penetrate buried targets such as Iranian nuclear facilities .
* The strategy review called for increased investment in upgrading U.S. weapons infrastructure , saying this “ will not only guarantee our stockpile , but facilitate further nuclear reductions . ”
Arms control experts see potential for significant cuts in the U.S. stockpile by upgrading weapons laboratories to weed out older , ineffective warheads .
* The administration pledged to pursue further arms control with Russia beyond the new START pact , which Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev will sign in Prague on Thursday and which will cut nuclear arsenals by a third .
It said any new efforts would address not only strategic weapons but also non-strategic and non-deployed nuclear weapons .
The administration also pledged to pursue high - level dialogue with Moscow and Beijing to promote stability and transparency .
* The review stopped short of declaring deterrence from nuclear attack to be the only purpose of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and did not renounce a first - strike option -- as arms control advocates had hoped .
But it did set a longer - term objective of making deterrence the “ sole ” purpose of America ’s atomic weapons .
* The document declared that the United States would keep up efforts to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in national security strategy while strengthening conventional arms capabilities .
* The Obama administration pledged not to conduct any further nuclear testing and to seek long - delayed ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty .
The treaty was rejected by the U.S. Senate in the 1990s and still faces big hurdles with lawmakers who believe it can be exploited by Iran and North Korea .
He said : '' Do n't use petrol on bonfires and be very careful .
People think they 're just putting liquid on the bonfire but it's the petrol vapours that have built up around it that are so dangerous . ''
This is the birthday cake my Wife made for me this year .
We have a teddy bear cake pan that has n't been used much so I suggested making it an ewok from Star Wars for me this year .
She did all the work of baking the cake and decorating it , but it was MY idea .
The store bought cupcake with the LEGO scout troopers was her idea .
A candle sticking out of the top of the ewok 's head would n't have looked right .

経済産業省が公表しているスライドがよく出来ているのでここでも紹介（ht @kazemachiroman）。日本が抱える問題とここに至るまでの経緯が丁寧に解説されている。ではどうしたらいいのかという部分になると急に説得力がなくなるが、日本語だし全部読む価値はあるように思う。特に興味深いグラフを幾つか抜粋する。
日本の産業を巡る現状と課題
まず各国の貯蓄率の推移だ。日本は貯蓄率が高く、アメリカは借金だらけというイメージを持つ人が多いと思われるが、日本の貯蓄率はアメリカを下回っている。高齢化や社会保障によって貯蓄率が下がるのはしょうがないが、それにしても衝撃的な数字だ。
最近、株主主権の問題と絡めて話題となった労働分配率だがここでも日本は英米独仏などよりも高い水準を保っている。特にドイツが一番低いのは興味深い。
企業の海外移転に関するアンケート結果だ。多くの企業が生産機能移転を決定ないし検討しているとのこと。生産コストを考えればその流れは当然だろう。日本で働く人は開発・研究・本社機能で能力を発揮出来るようにならないと厳しい。
こちらは三大都市圏及び地方の人口推移だ。全体に人口が減っていくものの、相対的に地方での人口減少が深刻となる。
特に地方圏では、今後急速に人口減少。地域経済の立て直しが深刻な課題。
とはいえ、既に莫大な予算をつぎ込んでいる地方経済をどう立て直すというのだろうか。
実質失業率は急激に伸びている。日本の比較的低い完全失業率は企業による抱え込み＝保蔵によって維持されているに過ぎない。
当然これだけの余剰人員を抱えていれば労働生産性で他国に引けをとるのは当然の帰結だろう。
企業内部で再配分が行われているような状況であり、雇用者報酬も伸び悩む。国境を越えられるような人材の確保はますます難しくなりそうだ（こっちも購買力平価だよね？）。
では日本の問題は何か。まず挙げられているのが実効法人税率の圧倒的な高さだ。どこの国で始めても良いような産業があえて日本を選ぶことはないだろう。儲かりそうであるほどそうだ。運輸の関する費用も高く事業コストが足かせになっている状況が分かる。
資本市場としての魅力もない。シンガポールの躍進をみればアジアでの地位は完全に失われたといっていいだろう（追記：資本市場の地位という意味）。
資料では、これらの経緯・現状を踏まえた上でさらなる産業政策の重要性が強調されているが、現状はその産業政策の失敗とも捉えられる。まずは企業活動がしやすい環境を整え、国内での競争を促進することで生産性を上げることが重要だろう。そうすることで、政府が成長産業を決め打ちしなくても、優秀な産業が競争に生き残る。
結論部分こそ微妙だが、全体として非常によく出来た資料なので、時間のある時にでも是非読んでみてほしい。
The head of the IRS seems to be confirming what we suspected : the agency is going to enforce the mandate by deducting any penalties from your tax refund , not by using its other enforcement authorities such as the ability to file tax liens .
This bodes ill for the power of the mandate to prevent insurance markets from spiralling out of control ; apparently , we 're already seeing some evidence of gaming in Massachusetts , though it 's not clear how widespread the practice is .
But leave that aside for the nonce , because it 's tax season , and I want to point out something that most people seem unaware of : it is not a good thing to get a tax refund .
Getting a " refund " on your taxes means that you have just made an interest - free loan to the government .
Do you relish the opportunity to make interest - free loans to anyone else , just for the sheer joy of eventually getting your own money back ?
I hope not .
If you get a tax refund every year , that means that you 're withholding too much .
Go to HR and change that -- and then bank a little bit of your salary in an FDIC - insured money market , where you 'll at least get a few bucks out of it .
If you 're really clever , you 'll set that up as an automated direct deposit transaction .
That will give it all the characteristics of your tax refund -- the money will automatically disappear from your paycheck before you see it , so that if you do n't look at the money market fund all year , you can be pleasantly surprised by your " refund " .
The only difference is , your money is working for you , instead of the government .
We do n't know how or why yet , but the world 's online encyclopedia , Wikipedia , has gone down for the count .
Wikipedia only went down a few minutes ago , according to the Twitter stream , which is already pumping out dozens of tweets per minute about the outage .
There is only a " Server Not Found " message from our end .
Wikipedia.org is up , but most — if not all — of the language - based encyclopedias are down , including the English one .
Unlike Twitter and Facebook , there is n't a stream to check the status of the web 's de-facto information hub .
We 'll continue to investigate what is happening and let you know as soon as we find out .

It was only a week ago that Sirius XM announced that an app for the Droid platform would be available in May .
Today SiriusBuzz has learned that we may only have to wait another week to see the app live and in person .
This is something that Droid owners such as myself have been waiting for .
What we have learned is that the app could hit the market on or about May 6th , 2010 .
The company now has apps on three of the five major smart phone categories .
Official apps have still not been developed for the Microsoft or Palm lines .
Although Droid ( Google ) is currently fourth in the smart phone category , they are gaining share faster than any other platform , and it is possible that they will eclipse the Microsoft based phones soon if not already .
The timing of this news is interesting in that the company will have just reported their Q1 numbers on the heels of just reporting a debt pay - down , which was on the heels of the regaining full NASDAQ compliance .
Accompanying all of that good news is the announcement of what is anticipated to be decent auto sales numbers .
The official news of the Android app will be announced via an email to subscribers who signed up for the notification .
All in all , this represents more great timing by Sirius XM , as they continue their migration into the smart phone platform and garner more and more exposure .

Ms Makama will get $ 150,000 in prize money A Swazi lawyer has won a prestigious environmental award for her work exposing the extra-judicial killings of suspected poachers by game rangers .
Thuli Makama told the BBC she wanted to end the violence and see poachers prosecuted instead .
Under Swazi law , rangers can use force to prevent poaching .
She is one of six winners of the Goldman Environmental Prize - which is sometimes known as the Nobel prize for the environment .
Ms Makama , head of the Swazi environmental group Yonge Nawe , said the problem of rangers " overstepping " their powers occurred mostly in private game reserves .
" We are seeing incidents where people are being pursued to their homes , " she told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
" Where people are taken from their houses and all sorts of things are done to them . "
People are being killed for hunting a small impala
Thuli Makama
Ms Makama said while researching a documentary about local communities , she discovered at least 20 cases of suspected poachers who had been killed or maimed .
Poaching was often nothing more than the odd killing of an antelope or warthog in protected land , she told the Associated Press agency .
" These are just hunters and gatherers who need this to survive , " she said .
" People are being killed for hunting a small impala . "
But some point out that criminal syndicates run well - equipped and heavily armed poaching operations .
Ted Reilly , head of the private Big Game Parks , said his rangers act within Swaziland 's anti-poaching laws , often at great personal risk , AP reports .
" Very similar numbers of rangers have been killed in the line of duty by poachers as vice versa , " he said .
Ms Makama believes suspected poachers should be arrested and " taken through the due process of law " .
" There are many illegal acts that should not mean you are tried , sentenced and executed at the scene , " she told the BBC .
Ms Makama will receive her award - and $ 150,000 ( £ 98,000 ) in prize money - in San Francisco on Monday .

Hulu is a success .
Over the past two years , this partnership between News Corp. , Disney , and NBC has pulled in $ 100 million from advertisers .
Now the second biggest website for streaming video in the United States , trailing only YouTube , Hulu has turned an operating profit for the past six months .
But according to the LA Times , earning money is n't enough for Hulu 's corporate parents .
" That does n't come close to matching the revenue that these companies are accustomed to raking in from their more established businesses , " the Times writes .
" That 's why Hulu is under pressure from its owners to collect a subscription fee . "
While some users might gripe about Hulu asking for their credit card numbers , the site 's plan actually makes a lot of sense .
For the most part , everything that was free will stay free .
The five most recent episodes of each TV show will remain open to all .
However , the subscription plan will unlock episodes from earlier in the season .
Hulu will experiment with subscriptions – starting with $ 9.95 a month – to see what users are willing to spend .
" Television executives do n't want to suffer the same fate as music industry or newspapers , which saw users flock to free access to songs , stories and classified ads online -- and revenues plummet , " reports the LA Times .
For -pay episodes will likely still take commercial breaks – much like cable TV .
Currently , Hulu runs about one ad per interruption , but according to the Times , eventually " Hulu is expected to adopt the same commercial loads as network television . "
This move to monthly subscriptions is not a huge surprise .
Hulu hinted last year that it would explore new business models .
And in February , rumors suggested that an upcoming Hulu app for the iPad would come with a price tag .

Would you pay $ 10 a month for more Hulu ?

Easter
Easter is Described as a Christian holiday which celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ , the date of celebration varies from March to April , depending on the date of the March equinox .
Many worldwide gather for this major holiday for the religion to feast , attend church services , and hunt Easter eggs .
Easter Sunday marks the end of Lent , which is a 40 - day period of fasting and reflection .
It follows Maundy Thursday and Good Friday .
Traditions
Below is a list of many traditions about Easter and how they originated .
The Easter egg hunt is a tradition that originated with pagan spring festivals that celebrated fertility .
Like many pagan traditions , religions intertwined the practice .
Easter egg hunts feature eggs hidden by the mythical Easter bunny , which may contain candy or other prizes .
Hard - boiled eggs are also be used .
The children will go looking for eggs to put in their Easter egg basket .
On the day before Easter , many families decorate hard - boiled eggs with paint to use for the hunt .
Eggs are also part of the tradition because of the ban on eggs during lent in Medieval Europe , meaning they were often included in the Sunday feast .
Churches are often decorated with flowers .
A significant theme for Easter is rebirth , which flowers can emulate and symbolize .
Traditional Easter flowers include Easter Lilies , which are believed to have grown in the Garden of Gethsemane , the site of Jesus ’s arrest .
Other Easter flowers include pussy willows , daffodils , narcissuses , and red tulips , which symbolize Jesus ’s shed blood .
Including the candy hidden inside of Easter eggs , many children are given a basket of goodies at the day ’s beginning .
A common gift is a chocolate bunny .
Countries all over the world celebrate the holiday differently .
Italy holds reenactments of the Easter story held in the public squares .
Cyprus holds bonfires in the yards of schools and churches .
In Germany , eggs are set in trees , called Easter egg trees , similar to the Christmas tree .
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have several unique Easter traditions .
One features the males of a family spanking females with a homemade whip decorated with ribbons .
The spanking is lighthearted and is believed to bring health over the next year .
The men may also dump cold water on them in some areas .
It is also a day for men to pay visits to objects of their affection .
In the United Kingdom , observers participate by rolling eggs downhill and in some areas by performing the Pace Egg play , a traditional local event .
A big part of Jamaican celebration is to eat a spiced bun that may contain raises with cheese .
In Scandinavian countries like Norway , celebrators ski and relax at cabins in the mountains .
Some areas may features children in costumes going door to door for candy or flowers .
Many Nordic countries include salmon or another type of fish with the feast .
In Australia , the Easter Bilby delivers eggs rather than the Easter Bunny , as bunnies are viewed as an agricultural pest .
The city of Haux , France , make an omelet big enough to feed 1000 .
The dish is often has about a 10 inch diameter .
On the island of Corfu in Greece , residents toss pots of water out of windows , following the Venetian tradition of breaking pots in celebration .
They also bake cakes in the shape of doves , called kolompines .
Guyana flies homemade kites , a tradition often participated in by citizens of all religions .
Pagan Origins
In pagan celebrations , Easter was typically a celebration of fertility , and many cultures associated the celebration with the Germanic goddess of fertility , Eostre , which is where the holiday ’s name came from .
Some cultures called the holiday Ishtar , which celebrates the resurrection of the Tammuz , another pagan god .
The Easter Bunny is also a result of folkloric tradition .
Their association with the holiday comes from their ability to procreate , making them symbols of fertility .
German settlers brought the Easter Bunny tradition to America in the 1700s .
A study by Microsoft Australia found that many parents are not protecting their children while navigating the sometimes dangerous Internet .
In fact , the study found that about 30 % of kids talk with strangers while online .
For safety 's sake :
That 's not good !
The Microsoft Australia study , performed on a sample of the Australian population , found that , generally , parents are doing a poor job of making sure their children are safe and protected while surfing the Internet and doing all of the other Web activities that kids do these days .
The survey , called ' For Safety 's Sake ' was released on March 17 , 2010 , found this major problem with children being on the Internet without parental support :
'¢ 65 % of Australian parents do not take any type of precautions '” at all '” to protect their children online while they are surfing the Web at home
'¢ 60 % of Australian parents allow their children to use the Internet at home without any type of supervision or restrictions '” none what so ever .
The survey also found these other potential problems with allowing children to use the Web without adult supervision :
'¢ Only 60 % of parents knew that parental controls were located on their computers used by their children
'¢ About 30 % of parents used parental locks to control their children 's activities on the computer .
Hey there is more disturbing statistics from this Microsoft survey .
Please read on .
The Microsoft Australia survey also included with these statistics :
'¢ About 30 % of children talk with strangers while online
'¢ 20 % of parents have caught their children looking at " inappropriate material " on the Internet
'¢ 36 % of parents reported that they had discovered , after the fact and without permission , that their children had downloaded software from off the Web .
'¢ 20 % of parents have not discussed safety with their children when it comes to using the Internet .
'¢ 12 % of parents reported that they had caught their children giving out personal information on the Internet .
'¢ Around 65 % of parents knew of some of their children 's online friends for social networking websites
'¢ About 11 % of parents did not know of any online friends of their children .
'¢ 58 % of households had the family computer in a public area , such as the family room ; which means that 42 % of homes had computers in non-public areas , such as a child 's bedroom .
Page three concludes with some comments and advise from the chief security advisor from Microsoft Australia .
In part , the article adds this bit of information : " Despite two thirds of parents surveyed allowing their children free reign to the web at home , most believe that online danger is more likely to occur at a friend 's house ( 52 percent ) . "
No doubt , the parents at the friend 's house are saying exactly the same thing about you .

Google Chrome 's Pin Tab feature shrinks any tab down to only a web site 's favicon to save precious tab bar real estate — no extension required .
In August we detailed how to set up space - saving , icon-only tabs in Firefox so you 've always got quick access to your most - used webapps ( like Gmail and Google Reader ) without wasting a lot of tab bar real estate .
The FaviconizeTab Firefox extension is the secret sauce to that setup , allowing you to shrink any tab down to just the site 's favicon ( the small icon image already in the tab ) ; in the most recent dev channel releases of Chrome , you get the same functionality without needing to install anything .
Here 's how it works :

Either you can right - click the tab you want to shrink and click on Pin Tab , or , if you 've already pinned a tab , you can just drag new tabs over to the left of the window and they 'll shrink automatically .
Pinned tabs are n't permanent , but it would be really nice to have the option to choose whether or not pinned tabs will stick around between sessions .

The Pin Tab feature 's not brand new ( it 's been around since at least earlier in September ) , but it 's a pretty nice one that slipped by our notice .

It looks like the Party of No has become the Party of Maybe No One Will Notice We Tried This Before ...
Today the Republican Party has announced their latest attempt " to craft a new agenda , " with the launch of a website called AmericaSpeakingOut.com :
“ There ’s going to be a months - long period of engaging with the American people , asking for their ideas and [ gauging ] what their priorities are , and that ’s going to take time , ” Buck said .
“ Most people come up with an agenda in a back room in Washington , put it forward and say here ’s what it is , take it . " [...]
The America Speaking
Out initiative will also include town hall meetings and other public forums that will allow Republicans to gather ideas for the new GOP agenda from citizens around the country .
... sounds awfully familiar , does n't it ?
Today , we are launching the National Council for a New America ( NCNA ) , a caucus of Congressional leaders gathering the expertise of national leaders and doers .
We hope that will form the foundation of a concerted , policy - based forum to listen to , partner with , and empower the American people with ideas and solutions that speak directly to the needs of our great nation .
This forum will engage in a conversation with America that seeks to remove ideological filters , addresses the realities we are confronting , and speaks to the challenges our citizens are facing .
The NCNA will bring together citizens from across the country to begin a dialogue with the American people through a series of forums , town halls , and an online effort that will engage people in a discussion to meet our common challenges and build a stronger country through common - sense ideas .
The NCNA was the disastrous and short - lived effort that managed to offend the Christian right crowd , was condemned by Rush Limbaugh ( the kiss of death ) , and that held the one and only stop on their " outside the beltway listening tour " inside the beltway .
Earlier this month , the " suspension " of the NCNA was announced ( because of " relentless attacks from the left " ) and now it looks like the Republican Party is slapping some new lipstick on an old pig .
The Party of No is still the Party of No New Ideas .
William Gheen , the leader of an anti-illegal immigration group , has received considerable attention after asking Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) to admit he ’s gay — an unsubstantiated allegation — before liberals can use it against him .
Comedy Central ’s Stephen Colbert slammed Gheen Thursday and quipped , “ Lindsey Graham , save your good name by releasing a sex tape ! ”

“ Nine times out of ten I ’m on the side of whoever is calling somebody gay , ” Colbert said .
“ But the person being accused here is a senator from my home state , an I ’m not going to let someone slander his good name . ”
Graham , who has been the target of rumors about his sexuality for years , Ã‚Â says he ’s not gay .
In this case , he was arguably targeting by Gheen because he is one of a few Republican senators willing to negotiate with Democrats for immigration reform .
“ I hope this secret is n’t being used as leverage over Senator Graham , so today I think Senator Graham , you need to come forward and tell people about your alternative lifestyle and your homosexuality , ” Gheen told a Crowd of Tea Partiers in South Carolina last weekend .
The remarks went viral after they were posted on YouTube by his group , Americans for Legal Immigration PAC ( ALIPAC ) .
At one point , the video was marked with the tags “ queer ” and “ fag . ” ALIPAC claimed that their video page had been hacked and the tags were soon removed .
“ I have to admit , that was very brave of Mr. Gheen .
Outing someone usually takes the kind of courage only displayed by male prostitutes paid by tabloid magazines , ” quipped Colbert in his “ The Word ” segment Thursday .

Colbert looked to an old “ Sex and the City ” episode for ways the senator can clear this up permanently .
In season six , Kim Catrall ’s character is determined to quash rumors that her male model boyfriend is gay , and decides that only by making a sex tape can her man prove he ’s straight .
“ Sir , it will save your career , ” Colbert said .
“ Because any kind of straight sex seems to be okay with the GOP .
I mean , just look at Governor Mark Sanford , Senator John Ensign or Senator David Vitter , who is still in office despite being named as a client by the D.C. madam three years ago and dogged by rumors that he allegedly likes prostitutes to dress him up in diapers . ”
“ So just rent the equipment .
Hell , rent the girl .
Just put it in there and get it out there , ” Colbert suggested .

At that , Colbert turned his attention to Gheem .
“ He ’s a big opponent of illegal immigration , and the immigration reform bill is the next big piece of legislation in Obama ’s pipeline .
Now , Gheen knows the Republicans only have 41 seats in the Senate .
To block legislation , they have to march in unison .
So the real threat is not the fact that Lindsey Graham is gay , which he is n’t , it ’s that he ’s bi , which he is , bi-partisan , ” the comedian said .
Gheen has suggested Graham may be getting blackmailed into bipartisanship , but the activist has n’t targeted other Republican senators — such as Sens. Olympia Snowe ( ME ) , Susan Collins ( ME ) and Scott Brown ( MA ) — who have voted with President Obama on initiatives .

Even
Gheen seems to swing both ways .
“ I just found out that he worked with the Democratic party in the 1990s .
That sounds pretty bipartisan , ” Colbert said .
Based on that fact , Colbert turned the tables in Gheen .
“ I ’ve got to at least consider the possibility that someone found out he gets off by going to the ballpark on weekends and laying in a trough in the men ’s room like a human urinal cake .
I have got nothing to back that up .
I just need to know that that ’s not true , ” he concluded .

WASHINGTON — Citigroup ran into trouble under the noses of federal regulators .
But even after taxpayers rescued the financial giant , regulators failed to monitor the company adequately , according to reviews by the Federal Reserve .
Excerpts of two Fed reviews were released on Wednesday as the committee examining the causes of the financial crisis began three days of hearings on the problems at Citigroup , Fannie Mae and the subprime mortgage market .
The panel heard a strong defense of the Fed from its former chairman , Alan Greenspan , who fended off a barrage of questions about the Fed ’s failure to crack down on subprime mortgages and other abusive lending practices during his tenure .
But the excerpts , culled from thousands of documents turned over to the bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission , painted a troubling picture of the Fed ’s oversight of Citigroup both before and after Mr. Greenspan left the Fed — and again after Citigroup received three taxpayer - financed bailouts .
Brothers traveling in Mexico during Sunday 's deadly earthquake photographed a surreal sight :
The power of the quake lifting a layer of dust off a mountain range .
The dramatic photographs were shot by Roberto and Adrian Marquez Marquez just after the 3:40 p.m magnitude 7.2 quake .
The pictures show the area around La Rumorosa , the highest point in Tecate .
See More Photos of the Shaking Mountains
" We felt the truck shake and the roads cracking , " Roberto wrote to NBCSanDiego .
" We stopped and looked at the big hills , and the force of the quake shook the mountains and dust started to come up . "
The mountainous area is made up of " huge rock formations that provide incredible natural landscapes , views and a unique sound of wind , " which the 4,000 - foot peak is named for , according to a tourist Web site about the Tecate area .
The quake tore the road apart the men were traveling on and destroyed or did damage to dozens of homes and businesses in nearby Mexicali , a bustling commercial center along Mexico 's border with California where the quake hit hardest , said Baja California state Gov. Jose Guadalupe Osuna .
Most of the destruction was in small farming communities on the outskirts of the city .
A 94 - year - old man was killed when a wall collapsed in his home in the city , and a transient died when the abandoned home he was living in collapsed in a farming community , Osuna said .
Civil protection authorities said Sunday that another man died when he ran into the street in panic and was struck by a car , but the government did not count him among the earthquake victims Monday .
Steven Strogatz on math , from basic to baffling .
In middle school my friends and I enjoyed chewing on the classic conundrums .
What happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object ?
Easy — they both explode .
Philosophy ’s trivial when you ’re 13 .
But one puzzle bothered us : if you keep moving halfway to the wall , will you ever get there ?
Something about this one was deeply frustrating , the thought of getting closer and closer and yet never quite making it .
( There ’s probably a metaphor for teenage angst in there somewhere . )
Another concern was the thinly veiled presence of infinity .
To reach the wall you ’d need to take an infinite number of steps , and by the end they ’d become infinitesimally small .
Whoa .
Questions like this have always caused headaches .
Around 500 B.C. , Zeno of Elea posed a set of paradoxes about infinity that puzzled generations of philosophers , and that may have been partly to blame for its banishment from mathematics for centuries to come .
In Euclidean geometry , for example , the only constructions allowed were those that involved a finite number of steps .
The infinite was considered too ineffable , too unfathomable , and too hard to make logically rigorous .
But Archimedes , the greatest mathematician of antiquity , realized the power of the infinite .
He harnessed it to solve problems that were otherwise intractable , and in the process came close to inventing calculus — nearly 2,000 years before Newton and Leibniz .
In the coming weeks we ’ll delve into the great ideas at the heart of calculus .
But for now I ’d like to begin with the first beautiful hints of them , visible in ancient calculations about circles and pi .
Let ’s recall what we mean by pi .
It ’s a ratio of two distances .
One of them is the diameter , the distance across the circle through its center .
The other is the circumference , the distance around the circle .
Pi is defined as their ratio , the circumference divided by the diameter .
If you ’re a careful thinker , you might be worried about something already .
How do we know that pi is the same number for all circles ?
Could it be different for big circles and little circles ?
The answer is no , but the proof is n’t trivial .
Here ’s an intuitive argument .
Imagine using a photocopier to reduce an image of a circle by , say , 50 percent .
Then all distances in the picture — including the circumference and the diameter — would shrink in proportion by 50 percent .
So when you divide the new circumference by the new diameter , that 50 percent change would cancel out , leaving the ratio between them unaltered .
That ratio is pi .
Of course , this does n’t tell us how big pi is .
Simple experiments with strings and dishes are good enough to yield a value near 3 , or if you ’re more meticulous , 3 and 1/7th .
But suppose we want to find pi exactly or at least approximate it to any desired accuracy .
What then ?
This was the problem that confounded the ancients .
Before turning to Archimedes ’s brilliant solution , we should mention one other place where pi appears in connection with circles .
The area of a circle ( the amount of space inside it ) is given by the formula
Here A is the area , π is the Greek letter pi , and r is the radius of the circle , defined as half the diameter .
All of us memorized this formula in high school , but where does it come from ?
It ’s not usually proven in geometry class .
If you went on to take calculus , you probably saw a proof of it there , but is it really necessary to use calculus to obtain something so basic ?
Yes , it is .
What makes the problem difficult is that circles are round .
If they were made of straight lines , there ’d be no issue .
Finding the areas of triangles , squares and pentagons is easy .
But curved shapes like circles are hard .
The key to thinking mathematically about curved shapes is to pretend they ’re made up of lots of little straight pieces .
That ’s not really true , but it works … as long as you take it to the limit and imagine infinitely many pieces , each infinitesimally small .
That ’s the crucial idea behind all of calculus .
Here ’s one way to use it to find the area of a circle .
Begin by chopping the area into four equal quarters , and rearrange them like so .
The strange scalloped shape on the bottom has the same area as the circle , though that might seem pretty uninformative since we do n’t know its area either .
But at least we know two important facts about it .
First , the two arcs along its bottom have a combined length of πr , exactly half the circumference of the original circle ( because the other half of the circumference is accounted for by the two arcs on top ) .
Second , the straight sides of the slices have a length of r , since each of them was originally a radius of the circle .
Next , repeat the process , but this time with eight slices , stacked alternately as before .
The scalloped shape looks a bit less bizarre now .
The arcs on the top and the bottom are still there , but they ’re not as pronounced .
Another improvement is the left and right sides of the scalloped shape do n’t tilt as much as they used to .
Despite these changes , the two facts above continue to hold : the arcs on the bottom still have a net length of πr , and each side still has a length of r .
And of course the scalloped shape still has the same area as before — the area of the circle we ’re seeking — since it ’s just a rearrangement of the circle ’s eight slices .
As we take more and more slices , something marvelous happens : the scalloped shape approaches a rectangle .
The arcs become flatter and the sides become almost vertical .
In the limit of infinitely many slices , the shape is a rectangle .
Just as before , the two facts still hold , which means this rectangle has a bottom of width πr and a side of height r.
But now the problem is easy .
The area of a rectangle equals its width times its height , so multiplying πr times r yields an area of πr2 for the rectangle .
And since the rearranged shape always has the same area as the circle , that ’s the answer for the circle too !
What ’s so charming about this calculation is the way infinity comes to the rescue .
At every finite stage , the scalloped shape looks weird and unpromising .
But when you take it to the limit — when you finally “ get to the wall ” — it becomes simple and beautiful , and everything becomes clear .
That ’s how calculus works at its best .
Archimedes used a similar strategy to approximate pi .
He replaced a circle by a polygon with many straight sides , and then kept doubling the number of sides to get closer to perfect roundness .
But rather than settling for an approximation of uncertain accuracy , he methodically bounded pi by sandwiching the circle between “ inscribed ” and “ circumscribed ” polygons , as shown below for 6- , 12 - and 24 - sided figures .
Then he used the Pythagorean theorem to work out the perimeters of these inner and outer polygons , starting with the hexagon and bootstrapping his way up to 12 , 24 , 48 and ultimately 96 sides .
The results for the 96 - gons enabled him to prove that
In decimal notation ( which Archimedes did n’t have ) , this means pi is between 3.1408 and 3.1429 .
This approach is known as the “ method of exhaustion ” because of the way it traps the unknown number pi between two known numbers that squeeze it from either side .
The bounds tighten with each doubling , thus exhausting the wiggle room for pi .
In the limit of infinitely many sides , both the upper and lower bounds would converge to pi .
Unfortunately , this limit is n’t as simple as the earlier one , where the scalloped shape morphed into a rectangle .
So pi remains as elusive as ever .
We can discover more and more of its digits — the current record is over 2.7 trillion decimal places — but we ’ll never know it completely .
Aside from laying the groundwork for calculus , Archimedes taught us the power of approximation and iteration .
He bootstrapped a good estimate into a better one , using more and more straight pieces to approximate a curved object with increasing accuracy .
More than two millennia later , this strategy matured into the modern field of “ numerical analysis . ”
When engineers use computers to design cars to be optimally streamlined , or when biophysicists simulate how a new chemotherapy drug latches onto a cancer cell , they are using numerical analysis .
The mathematicians and computer scientists who pioneered this field have created highly efficient , repetitive algorithms , running billions of times per second , that enable computers to solve problems in every aspect of modern life , from biotech to Wall Street to the Internet .
In each case , the strategy is to find a series of approximations that converge to the correct answer as a limit .
And there ’s no limit to where that ’ll take us .

Over the weekend , Steven Thomma at McClatchy News had a terrific piece that was a decent corrective to some of the bad history that 's being bandied about by right - wingers like Glenn Beck these days :
In articles and speeches , on radio and TV , conservatives are working to redefine major turning points and influential figures in American history , often to slam liberals , promote Republicans and reinforce their positions in today 's politics .
The Jamestown settlers ?
Socialists .
Founding Father Alexander Hamilton ?
Ill - informed professors made up all that bunk about him advocating a strong central government .
Theodore Roosevelt ?
Another socialist .
Franklin D. Roosevelt ?
Not only did he not end the Great Depression , he also created it .
Joe McCarthy ?
Liberals lied about him .
He was a hero .
Some conservatives say it 's a long - overdue swing of the pendulum after years of liberal efforts to define history on their terms in classrooms and in popular culture .
" We are adding balance , " Texas school board member Don McLeroy said .
" History has already been skewed .
Academia is skewed too far to the left . "
The upshot of this wave of historical revisionism -- which was kicked off , in many regards , with the publication of Jonah Goldberg 's fraudulent rewrite of history , Liberal Fascism -- is to depict the progressive movement as the source of all evils that have befallen America since the dawn of time .
That 's why Glenn Beck has embarked on a campaign of eliminationism against progressives .
Beck provided a splendid example of this miscarriage of history last month when he ran a segment claiming that FDR actually admired Mussolini by citing a selective quote .
( In fact , many people were enamored of Mussolini 's words , early on , and then were disabused by his actions . )
Somehow left out of the discussion :
The fact that FDR declared war on Mussolini and effectively drove him from power .
Yeah , that 's some admiration society .
But really , the entire enterprise is utter bosh .
As we 've pointed , at least in respect to middle - and working - class economics , and civil rights , there 's a whole bunch of things Beck and his cohorts are omitting from the picture .
Let 's just talk , for a moment , about the many things Americans enjoy -- and largely take for granted -- that were the product of the progressive movement .
Here , just off the top of my head , are my Top 12 :
The 40 - hour work week .
Weekends .
Vacations .
The right of women to vote .
The right of people of all colors to vote .
The right of people of all colors to use public schools and facilities .
Public schools .
Child - labor laws .
The right to unionize .
Health - care benefits .
National Parks .
National Forests .
Those are just for starters .
I bet you can come up with some of your own .
Saying you believe the progressive movement has brought evil on the nation should logically suggest that you want to reverse the reforms that it has produced .
That is , you 're saying you want to take these 12 things away , too .
That might not be such a popular thing to do , ya know ?
» Die fünf Prozent sind zum Greifen nah . « PIRATEN - Spitzenkandidat zur Landtagswahl in Nordrhein - Westfalen Nico Kern sieht seine Partei auf der Siegerstraße .
Drei Prozent würde die Piratenpartei in NRW erhalten , wenn am Sonntag Landtagswahl wäre .
Das hat die Forschungsgruppe Wahlen herausgefunden , die für das ZDF die Politbarometer - Daten erhebt .
Zum ersten Mal überhaupt hat das Umfrage - Institut damit die PIRATEN eigens in der Statistik aufgeführt .
Denn die Piratenpartei ist zwar anders , gehört aber längst nicht mehr zu den „ Anderen “ .
» Die Wählerinnen und Wähler schätzen unsere ehrliche Politik « , ist Landesvorsitzende Birgit Rydlewski überzeugt .
» Wir wollen mehr Bürgerbeteiligung an der Politik und sind gegen immer mehr Zensur und Überwachung .
Natürlich sind wir auch gegen die Fünf - Prozent - Hürde , die kleine , innovative Parteien von der parlamentarischen Arbeit ausschließt .
Umso schöner , dass wir nun beste Chancen haben , selbst ins Parlament einzuziehen und für echte Beteiligungsreformen zu kämpfen . «
» Das Wahlergebnis in NRW wird einen großen Einfluss auf unseren eigenen Erfolg bei der Landtagswahl 2011 haben .
Wir freuen uns deshalb sehr über diese vielversprechende Prognose . « , so André Martens , Politischer Geschäftsführer des Landesverbands Baden - Württemberg .
» Der Einzug in den Landtag wäre ein Meilenstein in der Geschichte der Partei .
Viele Piraten aus Baden - Württemberg unterstützen deshalb tatkräftig den Wahlkampf vor Ort in NRW , um diesen Traum wahr werden zu lassen . «
Da keines der beiden Lager der Umfrage nach eine Mehrheit hat , könnten die PIRATEN am Ende das Zünglein an der Waage sein .
Mit seiner Stimme für die PIRATEN könnte jeder Wähler somit entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Politik der neuen Landesregierung nehmen .
So kann jeder den von den PIRATEN vertretenen Themen wie die Stärkung der Bürgerrechte , mehr Transparenz , bessere und kostenfreie Bildung und mehr Einfluss für den Bürger das nötige Gewicht geben .
Den vielversprechenden Endspurt in den Landtag starten die PIRATEN bereits am morgigen 1 .
Mai mit einer großen Aktion im Bochumer Stadtpark .
Mehr als 50 PIRATEN - Kandidaten präsentieren sich dort , während der Ministerpräsident etwas weiter in der Jahrhunderthalle Hof hält .
Am nächsten Tag startet dann der 24/7 - Infostand in der Düsseldorfer Altstadt .
168 Stunden nonstop wird die innovative Partei über ihre Inhalte informieren und um Unterstützung werben .
Und die Chancen sind nun richtig gut , dass der Marathon - Infostand direkt in eine riesige PIRATEN - Wahlparty übergehen wird .

Nearly a year ago , the Obama administration announced a deal that settled a long - running dispute which , over the years , has involved over a dozen states , the federal government , the Supreme Court , and the automobile industry .
The deal would see a rapid rise in the CAFE standards , which set the average fuel efficiency of the US ' automobile fleet .
Today , the EPA announced the finalized version of the deal .
The new CAFE standards will cover the years from 2012 through 2016 , and will shift the focus from one of gas mileage to one of carbon emissions : by 2016 , the combined average emissions for cars and light trucks cannot exceed 250 grams of carbon dioxide a mile .
That is the equivalent of 35.5 mpg in today 's terms .
Automakers will have some flexibility in how they reach this ; it appears that many will improve the efficiency of their vehicles ' electrical systems .
Over the lifetime of the vehicles , the EPA estimates that the new rules will save nearly a metric Gigaton of CO 2 emissions and 1.8 billion barrels of oil .
On the consumer side , the changes are expected to increase the price of vehicles by roughly $ 1,000 .
However , the increased fuel savings will balance that in a few years , and consumers are expected to save several thousand dollars over the lifetime of the vehicles .
Although everyone involved with the new rules seems content with the results , rumblings are already starting due to the short time window laid out .
2016 is n't too far away in terms of automotive design , and California , which spearheaded the development of the new rules , has apparently already considered raising standards further when the current deal expires .

​ San Diego District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis ’s war on medical marijuana patients and providers suffered another crushing defeat Thursday afternoon , as activist Eugene Davidovich was acquitted by a jury of all charges stemming from his arrest last year as part of Operation Endless Summer .
A Navy veteran with an honorable discharge , Davidovich started a legal medical marijuana collective in San Diego , carefully abiding by state law .
Eugene was arrested in February 2009 by San Diego narcotics officers for providing another legal patient with medical marijuana .
He told Toke of the Town that the chief investigative officer in his case testified on the stand that the officer based his expert testimony on “ medical marijuana training ” on a handout from something called the Narcotic Educational Foundation of America , “ Drug Abuse Education Provider of the California Narcotic Officers ’ Association . ”
Use of Marijuana As A “ Medicine ” ( In these “ training ” materials , titled PDF ) ( the quotes are theirs ) , we learn immediately — in the first sentence ! — how these guys roll .
Davidovich was facing four felony charges and the very real possibility of a long prison sentence .
“ Marijuana , a plant from the cannabis family , is illegal and highly psychoactive , ” we are given to believe .
No mention of the fact that medical marijuana use is legal in California , and has been for 14 years now — and this , in materials used to educate law enforcement officers .
With training like that , it ’s no wonder these clueless morons chose to spend hundreds of man-hours and tens of thousands of dollars prosecuting a legal medical marijuana patient and provider , even as budget - challenged San Diego County is desperately looking for ways to cut spending .

My latest Business 2.0 article , The Black Box That Would Conquer Telecom , just went online over at the CNN Money website .
This is a story about a stealthy startup called Vyatta , that has build the world ’s first commercial open - source router , and how open source is slowly moving its way into the telecom world .
Vyatta ’s first product , an enterprise class router that will compete with Cisco - medium to low end offerings is currently in beta testing with some customers is based on XORP or extensible open router platform and runs off on two Intel chips .
The versatile open - source application can direct data traffic for a giant corporation as easily as it can manage a home Wi -Fi network .
And that ’s what makes it as disruptive as a leaf blower in a feather factory : Vyatta ’s router will cost about a fifth the price of comparable models from big networking equipment makers such as Cisco Systems .
Vyatta is one of the many start - ups that are bringing open source disruption to the highly profitable and closed world of networking .
While open source software movement has ravaged the bottom lines of companies like Sun Microsystems ; networking behemoths like Cisco and Juniper have continued to enjoy fat margins they earned even before the telecom crash of 2000 .
Even today , a big portion of their IT budget goes into networking gear .
Routers , switches , firewall devices , and even VPN boxes cost thousands of dollars .
“ Open - source is providing real competition to the commercial telecom companies , ” says John Todd , an open - source telephony expert .
“ It will force them to improve . ”
The scramble for open source in networking comes because two primal forces tearing the old telecom order apart .
First , the Internet - based technologies are replacing the closed legacy phone systems , thus helping the convergence of computer and the phone systems .
In old times , in order to build a networking box , companies would design specialized chips , and run specialized software on them to get the best performance .
Now you can buy extremely powerful processors like Advanced Micro Devices ’
Opteron chips for a few hundred dollars , run special networking software on them , and get similar performance .
There are nearly half - a- dozen open source projects that capitalize on the cheap processing power .
“ I used to work in Novell ’s multi protocol router group , but that failed because the chips were not fast enough , ” Chris Ranch , Director of Network Architecture at data center operator Affinity Internet .
“ But you can do it all on a good PC . ”
His company is currently using open source load balancing software running on 15 - pizza - box style servers that cost about $ 25,000 .
Similar gear from Cisco Systems or F5 Systems could have cost Affinity at least $ 750,000 .
“ Given that we making money by selling hosting services , the cost of equipment is the difference between us making money or not , ” says Ranch .
Corporations shopping for PBX systems are reaching same conclusions , and are turning to ultra- cheap boxes made by start - ups like Fonality , a Los Angeles company that packages open source Asterisk PBX software onto PCs running Linux .
But no project is as audacious as Vyatta ’s attempt to take on the highly lucrative and profitable router market .
Vyatta ’s core brains come from XORP , a software router project started at ICSI in Berkeley back in January 2001 .
Atanu Ghosh a British - born researcher who works on the project points out that the software can be scaled down to run a simple enough home router on one end of the spectrum , to large - scale data network on the other extreme .
“ It is easy for third parties to extend the software , and I think people will come up with ideas to extend it , ” says Ghosh .
The biggest interest in XORP and future Vyatta products will be in emerging economies like China and India , which are not cash rich , but have broadband ambitions .
No one wants to pay for expensive commercial routers .
“ In the near future there would be ad - hoc networks on a person , and that could conceivably need a router with a tiny footprint , like XORP , ” Ghosh predicts .
