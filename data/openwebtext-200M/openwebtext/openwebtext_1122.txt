The Clarendon section of Arlington , Va. , has rows of new town homes within walking distance of the subway .
Study : Denser development may cut pollution Would Americans drive less if they stopped living on big lots far from urban centers ?
If so , would that reduce pollution and dependence on energy ?
By how much ?
Meeting the growing demand for conveniently located homes in neighborhoods designed to encourage walking could significantly reduce the number of miles Americans drive while giving people more housing choices , a national research panel has concluded .
How much it would shrink the nation 's carbon footprint is not as clear .
Such questions , which have dominated the debate over " smart growth " for two decades , are getting the attention of lawmakers .
The Senate will debate a bill this fall that would cap greenhouse gas emissions , and Congress asked the National Academy of Sciences to quantify the effect of where Americans live on driving habits .
A boost from science After reviewing almost 100 studies conducted over 20 years , the National Research Council — one of the academy 's research bodies — released findings last week .
The research is potentially significant because it comes from a non-partisan group of mostly academics , scientists and researchers rather than advocacy groups : • More compact development would cut driving by 5 % to 12 % .
" Simply reducing family - lot sizes — say , from 1 acre to a quarter - acre — should reduce vehicle trip distances by bringing origins and destinations closer together , " the report says .
Denser development can concentrate enough people in one area to attract businesses , public transit , schools and jobs .
That , in turn , can reduce the need to drive everywhere .
•
Denser development will cut fuel use and carbon dioxide emissions .
By how much is murky .
" It will take awhile for that new development to have a very perceptible effect " on the number of miles driven , says José Go´mez - Ibáñez , chairman of the committee that produced the report and a planning professor at Harvard University .
" Even if we started ( developing ) more compact and densely today , given ( that ) new housing stock is only 1 % or 2 % of housing stock every year , it will be several decades before there is an impact . "
If 75 % of new and replacement housing units were built in more compact development — a scenario the report considers unlikely — residents of these communities would drive 25 % less .
Such a decline would cut carbon dioxide emissions 7 % to 8 % by 2030 and 8 % to 11 % by 2050 , the report concludes .
A more realistic scenario envisioned by the researchers has 25 % of future housing in denser communities .
The benefits : A 12 % reduction in driving but as little as a 1 % drop in emissions by 2030 .
The research suggests that many variables make it difficult to quantify the effect of denser development : • Building more densely wo n't stop driving if jobs and services are not nearby or if a community is built without sidewalks .
•
If cars become " greener , " driving 's impact on emissions will change .
•
Access to public transportation , such as light rail , subways , trolleys and buses , reduces driving more .
Research ' underwhelming '
The research council 's findings are " underwhelming , " says Samuel Staley , director of Urban & Land Use Policy for the Reason Foundation , a libertarian think tank .
Staley , who says Americans should have a choice to live in exurbia if they want to , says the research offers scant evidence that dense communities produce great benefits .
" CO2 reduction between 1 % and 11 % ?
That 's a huge variation , " he says .
" In order to achieve this , we 're talking about essentially not giving people much choice " of where to live .
Greater benefits will come from technological improvements , such as plug - in hybrid cars , he says .
" What comes out loud and clear is that if the miles we drive continue to grow at the projected rate , you blow your climate goals out of the water , " says David Goldberg , spokesman for Smart Growth America , a national coalition that advocates denser development .
" The basic message I got from this is that you can't go wrong by pursuing this strategy . "
In a 2007 report , the Urban Land Institute reached similar findings .
" The most important thing is to reduce the amount we drive , " says Ed McMahon , senior resident fellow at the institute , a research group that studies land use .
" By just building two houses per acre from one house per acre would reduce ( driving ) . "
The research stresses that " you could have substantially more compact development without giving up single - family housing , " Go´mez - Ibáña says .

Now you see me , now you do n't :
The artist who turns himself into the Invisible Man
Look carefully .
A little closer .
This is a portrait of a man trying to blend beautifully into the background .
Whether lurking next to a telephone box or standing to attention at a cannon , Liu Bolin has made an art of becoming the invisible man .
The Chinese artist is creating more than just startling images with his works .
Melting into the background : Artist Liu Bolin blends into a wall of graffiti in Beijing , China
Hanging by the telephone : Disguised amongst a pair of phone boxes .
Liu's art is intended to show how city surroundings affect people
He claims they make a statement about his place in society .
He sees himself as an outsider whose artistic efforts are not always valued , especially in his native country .
Standing silently in front of his chosen scene , in locations all around the world , the 36 - year - old uses himself as a blank canvas .
Then , with a little help from an assistant , he paints his body to merge as seamlessly as possible with what is behind him .
It means people walking by while he is carrying out his performances often have no idea he is nearby until he begins to move .
Stock still :
The artist arranges himself against a colourful wall .
He says his photographs often take more than 10 hours as he strives to get them just right
Can you see me ?
Liu hides ' behind ' a man
Liu said he wanted to show how city surroundings affected people living in them .
He added that the inspiration behind his work was a sense of not fitting in to modern society and was a silent protest against the persecution of artists .
He said : ' Some people call me the invisible man , but for me it's what is not seen in a picture which is really what tells the story .
' After graduating from school I could n't find suitable work and I felt there was no place for me in society .
' I experienced the dark side of society , without social relations , and had a feeling that no one cared about me , I felt myself unnecessary in this world .
' From that time , my attitude turned from dependence into revolting against the system . '
Liu said he was further pushed on with his work when the Chinese authorities shut down his art studio in Beijing in 2005 .
He said : ' At that time , contemporary art was in quick development in Beijing , but the government decided it did not want artists like us to gather and live together .
' Also many exhibitions were forced to close .
' The situation for artists in China is very difficult and the forced removal of the artist 's studio is in fact my direct inspiration of this series of photographs , Hiding In The City . '
Liu's art credentials were formed after he graduated from the prestigious Sculpture Department of Central Academy of Fine Arts in China .
He said his work requires a lot of patience with him having to pose and work on his photographs for more than ten hours at a time to get it just right .
' My job is to choose a good background where I want to be " disappeared " , and then stand there unmoved until a design has been painted on me , ' he said .
' There are many people who like my work I think because my work has a quiet strength , in the photographs .
' I am standing , but there is a silent protest , the protest against the environment for the survival , the protest against the state .
' I wanted to photograph the reality of scenes of China 's development today .
' My work is a kind of reminder , to remind people what the community we live in really looks like , and what kind of problems exist . '

The Ordinary Evil Of Bernard Madoff
Opinion By Gilbert Mercier , NEWS JUNKIE POST
Yesterday , Bernard Madoff was sentenced in New - York to 150 years behind bars , if nothing else his victims can be reassured that he will finish his life in jail .
When Madoff ’s victims describe him they often have used such words as likable unassuming and a man they could trust .
Many of them said that “ he was just like one of us , ” they thought Madoff was a “ mensch . ”
Like a lot of criminals in other communities , such as African - Americans & Latino , Madoff was praying on the Jewish community including Jewish charitable organizations .
Madoff stole from them , the SEC had been warned of the potential frauds for many years and on numerous occasions but failed to do anything about it .
Madoff ’s victims feel that the entire system let them down .
What Madoff ’s case illustrates is the crisis of trust that we are having in our financial institutions in general , and in Wall Street in particular .
Bernard Madoff is not the exception confirming the rule of Wall Street ’s culture .
In fact , it is quite the opposite , he was one of Wall Street ’s arrogant poster child , a full member of the self described “ Masters of the Universe ” of the financial world .
Madoff ’s victims though they were lucky to have their life savings in the hands of such a reputable man , and after all he could get them better returns than anyone else .
In essence , at least from a moral and ethical stand point there is only a small difference between Madoff ’s swindle and the management decisions from the bosses of AIG , Countrywide and Bank of America .
The principle is exactly the same , it is about deception and greed .
Without the collapse of late 2008 , Bernard Madoff could have kept his Ponzi scheme going for some time .
It only collapsed because too many people tried to cash out at the same time , just like AIG when world wide banking institutions decided it was time to look into getting some real financial guarantees on all the exotic derivatives they were holding .
Once the “ exotic derivatives ” were identified as being nothing more than over estimated bundled assets , they became known as toxic assets , a much more appropriate name .
Madoff was certainly a part in the arsenal of what Warren Buffett described as “ Financial Weapons of Mass Destruction , ” but he is not the only proverbial “ rotten apple . ”
Madoff is a symptom of a much larger problem .
Bernard Madoff is the symbol of our current moral crisis .
The trust in the system is gone , a lot of investors were under the impression that the “ Masters of the Universe ” could do no wrong .
In fact a large proportion of the so called financial elite were not only dishonest , but had no foresight of the gigantic looming problems .
Americans are starting to realize that the “ smartest guys in the room ” were not that bright after all .
So far the Obama administration has not done enough to change Wall Street ’s culture .
“ Greed is good ” would not be something politically correct to say at this juncture , but you can rest assured that somewhere in the financial world some Bernard Madoffs - in - the - making are working on some new scams .
Madoff ’s victims have a website , you can watch three touching testimonies here .
Tomorrow Switzerland 's Zoo Basel celebrates a remarkable birthday .
Goma , the first gorilla ever born in a European zoo , turns 50 !
Unusual for the time , Goma got tremendous press in 1959 during her first year , and today we share some of these classic photos .
It should be noted that unlike zoo born gorillas today , Goma spent the first years of her life almost entirely with zoo staff .
While this made her exceptionally close with humans , it made it difficult for her to enter gorilla society and it took many years for her to find her place with her fellow great apes .
Today as a result of gorillas like Goma , zoos go to great lengths to ensure that their animals are comfortable with their own kind .

If Fox News and Glenn Beck were wondering how far he could take his radical right wing routine , they got their answer as three major advertisers have deserted Beck ’s program after he called President Obama a racist .
Progressive Insurance , Procter & Gamble , and Lawyers.com have all dropped Beck .
Since the TV business runs on ad money , will this impact Beck ’s show ?
ChangeofColor.org put out a statement announcing that three companies had pulled their advertising .
Two of the companies , P&G and Progressive claimed that their ads should n’t have been airing on Beck ’s show in the first place .
“ No P&G ads should have appeared on this program in the first place , ” said Martha Depenbrock , Brand Building Stakeholder Relations for Procter & Gamble .
” To be clear , if any of our advertising appeared on the Glenn Beck show , it was in error and we appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention .
We will do what we can to see that it does n’t happen again . ”
Progressive also said that their ads should not have been running during Beck ’s show , “ Our ( advertising ) order specifies no Glenn Beck
We have confirmed with the network that our spots should not be running there , ” said Linda J. Harris , Media Director at Progressive Insurance .
This brings up an interesting point that many companies buy airtime and do n’t follow up to make sure that the ads are being run in the contracted slots .
Advertisements
It should be pointed out that these companies are still advertising on FNC , but they do n’t want anything to do with Glenn Beck ’s program .
Beck has one of the highest rated shows on cable news , but advertisers have to weigh the advantage of reaching his audience against the far right wing message his show carries .
The idea to people get advertisers to move away from Beck ’s program was something that I first heard from Donny Deutsch on MSNBC , who made it clear that he did n’t think it was a good idea to try to get advertisers not to buy time on FNC , but it would be more effective to get them to shift their dollars away from Beck .
Beck ’s conspiracy theories , race baiting , and controversy is not something that is attractive to many major corporations because they do n’t need the bad PR , and headaches that can come with Beck going off the deep end .
One of the fastest ways to lose advertisers is to engage in race based politics , which is what Beck did when he called Obama a racist .
I do n’t think that this will change the way Beck does his show , because 2 million viewers a night is a powerful sign of success , but if he continues to engage in race baiting , there will be fallout , and he will lose advertisers .
There is a line that Beck crossed when he labeled President Obama a racist , and advertisers will flee when race is brought up .

Monday night is the global premiere of “ The Age of Stupid . ”
The film is a scorching appeal for humans to avoid knowingly up - ending the earth ’s climate , delivered from the vantage - point of 2055 , when the giant London Eye ferris wheel looks more like a waterwheel , with its bottom immersed in the Thames , along with much of central London .
Its narrator , played by Pete Postlethwaite , is a Beckett - style loner who is a caretaker for all that remains of human science , culture and history , packed in a tower rising from the wave - dappled Arctic Ocean somewhere near the North Pole .
( The Times reviewed the film in July . )
The film starts at the end , spinning through a fast - forward collection of the worst possible worst - case scenarios for climate should no effort be made to curb greenhouse gases .
By 2055 , the planet has been ravaged by drought and storm , coastlines have flooded , millions have been dislocated or thrust into conflict .
Flicking a touch - screen computer , the caretaker of the Arctic archive , a variant on Dickens ’ Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come , wiles away the hours scrolling through video snippets from our decade , musing on how we had the knowledge and tools to transform our energy system , but chose to stick with business as usual .
“ The Age of Stupid ” is the product of six years of improvisational fund - raising , filmmaking and distribution work by Franny Armstrong , a Briton best known for McLibel , her documentary on a seven - year court battle between McDonald ’s and two vegetarian anti-meat , anti-corporate campaigners .
I spoke with Ms. Armstrong , who is 37 , by phone after watching a review copy of “ The Age of Stupid ” over the weekend .
From the beginning , around 2002 , she said one goal was to humanize the climate challenge the same way the feature film “ Traffic ” took on the sweeping story of the drug trade .
Initially she planned a conventional documentary following the stories of six people in different parts of the world whose lives were interrelated in some way by energy and related conflicts ( including the war in Iraq ) .
These characters include a wealthy entrepreneur in India who wants to end poverty while creating the country ’s first discount airline ; a young woman in Nigeria who aspires to be a doctor but scratches a living in lands fouled by oil extraction ; a young man in England fighting to install wind turbines but facing strident opposition from wealthy landowners who say they are worried about global warming , but appear more worried about their view .
The wind - power fight presents just about the most vivid portrait of the “ nimby ” ( not in my back yard ) syndrome that I can recall seeing .
The scenes in India , with Jeh Wadia , the entrepreneur , traveling by private jet and chauffeured car , may not play well there or in other fast - growing developing countries , where millions of people are trying to build businesses .
But Ms. Armstrong said she ’s still in touch with the airline tycoon and he harbors no hard feelings .
The name for the film came from a comment by Alvin DuVernay , who spent decades working for Shell Oil in the Gulf of Mexico and lost his New Orleans home in Hurricane Katrina .
“ With our use or misuse of resources the last 100 years or so , I ’d probably rename this age something like The Age of Ignorance , The Age of Stupid . ” he says .
Ms. Armstrong said she decided the material needed to be framed from the future because so much of the climate challenge derives from the time lag between emissions and the resulting climate change .
“ We have to deal now with something that ’s going to happen in 30 years , ” Ms. Armstrong said .
“ The only way to do that is to use our intellect .
Otherwise we ’re just yeast . ”
Her first structure had two teenagers as narrators , but she realized that would result in viewers being bombarded with blame from end to end .
She eventually settled on the curator character — whose tone is more a mix of sardonic and wistful than purely accusatory — and reached out to Mr. Postlethwaite after she learned he was trying to get a wind turbine installed on his home .
Ms. Armstrong , not content with pushing for climate action through the film alone , has helped create several new initiatives , one being NotStupid.org , and the other the 10:10 movement , which is trying to get companies , schools , organizations and everyone else to commit to cutting emissions of greenhouse gases 10 percent by 2010 .
The film opens in 440 theaters in the United States Monday evening and in 63 countries at last count , ranging from Israel to Madagascar .
( There would have been 64 , but the Nigerian government just canceled the screening in Lagos , she said , after realizing that part of the film focuses on accusations of government human - rights violations and misuse of oil money . )
If you get a chance to see it , or if you live in England where it had a release in March , weigh in with your reaction here .
In the meantime , here ’s a sampler of links to other coverage and reviews : Wired , Worldchanging.com , Treehugger , the Observer .
More will be added shortly .
Vor etwas mehr als einem
Jahr schrieb ich :
Stell dir vor , du holst deinen Laberziegel aus der Tasche , die synergische Mischung aus GPS , Google Maps und RottenNeighbor zeigt dir an , dass in dem Haus da drüben unzweideutig ein Sexualstraftäter haust , du öffnest die eingebaute Social Networking - Funktion und planst komfortabel ( Multitouch , UMTS , angepasster Handybrowser ) mit anderen besorgten Bürgern einen Spontanpogrom in anderthalb Stunden , um die Welt mal wieder ein kleines bisschen besser zu machen .
Kommt , sowas .
Ganz sicher .
Nun gibt es eine Sex - Offender - iPhone - App , mit Umgebungskarte und rot markierten Ortsmarkern überall dort wo Sexualstraftäter wohnen .
Und was kann die ? [ ]
Mit der App kann man eine Liste von Straftätern aufrufen , die entweder auf der gegenwärtigen Position basiert ( unter Verwendung der iPhone - Funktionen zur Ortsbestimmung ) , der Adresse eines Kontakts oder einer manuell eingegebenen Adresse .
Die App zapft dann die Datenbank an und listet die Sexualstraftäter nach der Nähe zur eingegebenen Position auf .
Nach einem Klick auf diese Namen erhält man ein Bild , persönliche Informationen wie Geburtsdatum , Größe , Gewicht [… ] .
Außerdem kann man sich über das Sexualverbrechen informieren lassen , das diejenige Person begangen hat .
TechCrunch listet als Negativaspekte dieser App auf , dass die Daten möglicherweise nicht immer akkurat und aktuell sind , sowie , dass sie hier und da gegen State Law , zum Beispiel in Kalifornien verstößt — jedoch nicht , weil es hier um Stigmatisierung und ein virtuelles An - den - Pranger - Stellen geht , das gegen elementare Grundsätze wie die Menschenwürde verstößt — sondern weil es illegal ist , persönliche Daten zum Zweck des Profits weiterzugeben .
Man sollte nicht vergessen , dass man in den USA schon als Kind ein „ Sex Offender “ sein kann .
Es gibt Fälle , in denen von Minderjährigen selbst gemachte Handy - Nacktbilder zu einer Klage wegen Kinderpornographie geführt haben .
Anderswo werden „ Doktorspiele “ von Kindern als pervers markiert .
Aus einem Dokument zum Thema von Human Rights Watch [ ] :
Kinder als Sexualstraftäter Mit 12 hatte Paul L. Ora*ls * ex mit seiner 6 - jährigen Cousine .
Paul wurde vor einem Gericht für Erwachsene des „ kriminellen sexuellen Gebarens mit einem Kind unter 13 “ schuldig gesprochen .
Paul hat ein intensives Behandlungsprogramm für Sexualstraftäter hinter sich .
Er nimmt sowohl an Gruppentherapien als auch an individuellen Beratungen teil .
Pauls Mutter hat Human Rights
Watch mitgeteilt , dass er sich 25 Jahre lang polizeilich registrieren muss , auch wenn die Gemeinde nicht informiert wird .
Dennoch hat diese Qual deutliche Auswirkungen auf Paul .
Laut seiner Mutter ist er als 15 - jähriger „ völlig eingeschüchtert .
Er hat mir erzählt , ‚ Mama , ich muss ein Monster sein .
In meiner Nähe sollte sich kein Mädchen aufhalten . ' “
Pauls Mutter schaut auch sorgenvoll in die Zukunft hinsichtlich der ausufernden Gesetze zur Einschränkung des Wohnens : „ Ich bin besorgt dass der Staat sagt , Sexualstraftäter dürfen sich nicht dort aufhalten , wo Kinder zusammenkommen und mein Kind , das technisch gesehen ein Sexualstraftäter ist , der ein anderes Kind belästigt hat , nicht mehr zur Schule gehen , mit seinen Freunden spielen oder die Kirche besuchen darf .
Finde nur ich das irgendwie abartig ?
Übrigens : Die iPhone App zur Auflistung der Sex Offenders ist eine der meistverkauften Anwendungen im iTunes Store .
Real engineers , when faced with complex design problems build and analyze prototypes to reduce the risk of implementing a flawed design .
Can the same be done with software also ?
How can we show if the system meets its design requirements ?
It is hard to devise all the possible test cases especially for concurrent software .
One of the most powerful formal methods is model checking .
In principle model checking generates all possible states of a program and checks that the correctness specifications hold in each state .
Model checking is challenging because the model should describe the system in sufficient detail and yet the model must be sufficiently simple so that the model checker can perform the verification within the reasonable limits of time and memory .
In this blog post I will model the Peterson ’s algorithm and verify the mutual exclusion property .
We will use Spin model checker .
Spin accepts design specification in the verification language Promela .
Promela is not an implementation language but a systems description language .
The emphasis in the language is on the modelling of process synchronization and coordination , and not on computation .
/** Model specified using Promela for Peterson 's algorithm **/
/* condition for mutual exclusion */
# define mutex ( critical <= 1 )
/* flag value is 1 when the process wants to enter CS */
/* turn holds the ID of the process whose turn it is */
bool flag [ 2 ] , turn ;
/* number of processes in the critical section */
byte critical = 0 ;
/* instantiating two processes */
active [ 2 ] proctype process ( )
{
/* process identifiers start from 0 */
pid i = _pid ;
pid j = 1 - _pid ;
/* do statement */
do
/* only one choice for execution */
:: /* process wants to enter CS */
flag [ i ] = true ;
/* but asks other process to go ahead */
turn = j ;
/* wait until the other process is not interested , */
/* or it is his own turn */
/* process is blocked until the statement is true */
! ( flag [ j ] && turn == j ) ;
/* critical section */
critical ++ ;
critical -- ;
/* end of critical section */
flag [ i ] = false ;
od ;
} Correctness claims are specified in the syntax of standard Linear Temporal Logic – a logic which is built for reasoning about things that change over time .
Mutual exclusion can be expressed using the temporal operator for always – [ ] .
For verification , the negation of the LTL formula is added with the - a argument ( verification mode ) and -f argument ( fairness condition of contention manager ) to the Spin command which generates the C source code for the model checker .
The file is compiled with the - DSAFETY argument so that it is optimized for checking safety properties .
Absence of an example on executing pan will indicate that the property is not violated .
$ spin - a -f '![] mutex ' peterson.pml
$ gcc -DSAFETY -o pan pan.c
$ ./ pan Fortunately there is no ‘ Model Checking for Dummies ’ book as of now .
To get started on this subject , I would suggest that you read the chapter on ‘ Verification by Model Checking ’ in the book Logic in Computer Science followed by the manual of the appropriate model checker .
Slate is retiring “ Today ’s Papers , ” one of the original aggregators of the Web , 12 years after it started its beloved once - a - day summary of the nation ’s news pages .
In its place comes a new recap of the news , one that acknowledges that the news cycle has , well , sped up quite considerably since “ Today ’s Papers ” started in 1997 .
That is why the “ Slatest , ” the name of the new feature that comes online Monday morning , will collect the world ’s news three times a day .
David Plotz , editor of the online magazine Slate , very superlatively calls it a “ very fast , very intelligent , very witty news aggregation feature . ”
The new feature will succeed both “ Today ’s Papers ” and its companion , “ Other Magazines . ”
In an interview , Mr. Plotz said that when “ Today ’s Papers ” was introduced in the early days of the Web , it met a need “ our readers had n’t even known they had . ”
It ’s a common enough theme .
The Pope is doing it now , blaming atheists for the world ’s environmental problems :
Is it not true that inconsiderate use of creation begins where God is marginalized or also where is existence is denied ?
If the human creature ’s relationship with the Creator weakens , matter is reduced to egoistic possession , man becomes the “ final authority , ” and the objective of existence is reduced to a feverish race to possess the most possible .
So , people are ruining the Earth because the do n’t believe in god , which naturally means they will become materialistic and in so doing destroy the environment .
Said the leader of a small city - state famous for accumulating massive amounts of wealth .
Even if you ignore the irony of the Pope blaming others for being materialistic ( do you have any idea how much good could be done if the Vatican sold off its assets and used it to help people ? ) , you are still left with the highly questionable chain of logic which claims that atheism causes “ egoistic possession ” which in turn leads to the environment being destroyed .
Over the years , I have encountered several conservative Christians who argued against environmental causes , pointing to scripture as the reason : “ fill the earth and subdue it , ” said god to man .
I have encountered several religious people who see this as free license to cut down the forests , exterminate species , decimate fish stocks , deplete resources : god gave these to us to do with as we please .
Many see the physical Earth as something that will be used up when Armageddon comes , so not to worry .
Not all , of course , but the people who deny that there ’s anything wrong , or the people who say that nothing needs to be done , happen most often to be the faithful .
Atheists , on the other hand , tend to be environmentally aware ; Daniel Florien points out that he cannot recall meeting an atheist who was not in favor of protecting the environment , and I have to admit to a similar impression .
Hardly all non-believers are activists in this , but the tendency is toward recognition of scientific findings and a sense of responsibility .
Since non-believers do n’t see a land of milk and honey after this one , they tend to be more focused on keeping the world we have in better shape .
The thing is , what the Pope is now saying about non-believers has all too familiar a ring to it ; where religion screws up , they quickly turn and accuse atheism of worse .
Ask a religious person about the horrors of war caused by belief , and they will quickly bring up Stalin , Hitler , and Mao , claiming that their atheism was responsible for more deaths than all religious atrocities put together .
Of course , it does not even matter that Hitler was not an atheist or that Stalin and Mao were ; the important fact is that atheist beliefs did not lead to the deaths they caused , and therefore their beliefs were irrelevant .
One might as well blame all of those deaths on the Eastern hemisphere , or tight collars .
When religion is blamed for violence , it is the direct result of religious dogma causing that violence .
The Crusades and the Inquisitions were excellent examples of this , albeit just a few of the countless historical slaughters carried out in the name of religion , spurred on by religious beliefs and animosities .
When Stalin killed , he did not do so in the name of atheism , nor did he act that way because of any atheist precept or line of reasoning .
None of that , of course , stops religious people from bringing up Stalin , Hitler , and Mao when the question is not even one of comparing belief systems , but of defending their own .
All of this stems from a feeling of righteousness –not earned , not reasoned , but simply bestowed–or so they imagine .
Of being the chosen ones , and everyone else goes to hell .
It ’s not just that they feel they ’re right , they feel that their being right is the only possible way that there is .
That all good things come from god , and that if you do n’t embrace god like they do , then these things are not possible for you .
And they do n’t seem to understand how offensive this is to others .
They instead simply see wrongness elsewhere , and cast the blame in that direction .
Take environmental issues : one huge element of this is overpopulation , a great deal of which comes from Catholicism itself and its insistence that contraception cannot be used .
Even if the Pope never rescinds this , if he were at least able to recognize it as part of what causes environmental problems , it would at least add credence to his views .
But instead he dwells on imagined evil by people he does not at all understand , people who believe differently from him , and therefore can not be good .
Rather than at least look dispassionately at the real causes , he instead takes the opportunity to apply his bias and blame those who disagree with him on the flimsiest of logical threads .
IT IS almost exactly 400 years since Galileo turned his telescope on the sun and saw it to be an imperfect orb covered in spots , quite unlike the teachings of Greek cosmology .
If his observations had been made four centuries later , he would have drawn a different conclusion .
The sun has recently shed its spots , prompting sceptics to renew their claims that climate change is not anthropogenic but rather heliogenic .
Sunspots are a bit of a mystery .
They appear as dark patches in the photosphere — the surface layer of the sun — that come and go .
Normally the number of sunspots peaks every 11 years , coinciding with times when the sun 's magnetic field is at its strongest .
As the field wanes , the number of sunspots falls to a trough at which point the sun 's magnetic field reverses direction and starts to regain its strength .

As early as 1801 William Herschel , a British astronomer , suggested that when sunspots were plentiful the Earth would be warmer .
He supported his hypothesis by reference to variations in the price of wheat published in Adam Smith 's “ Wealth of Nations ” .
More recently , solar scientists and climatologists have played down the role that sunspots might play in climate change .
Certainly they do affect the amount of radiation coming from the sun .
The dark sunspots are encircled by brighter areas , so when they are plentiful , the sun shines more brightly than when they are sparse .
Yet the overall variation is tiny , just 0.1 % of the sun 's total output , which seems insufficient to be the cause of a warming Earth .
Yet there is a curious historical correlation between sunspot cycles and global temperatures .
Between 1645 and 1715 , for reasons unknown , there were very few sunspots .
At the same time , Europe and North America experienced bitterly cold winters in what has come to be known as the Little Ice Age .
There is also some evidence that the southern hemisphere was similarly affected .
But correlation is not causation .
Might the sun be going through another extended period of inactivity ?
Certainly it is the quietest that it has been for almost a century .
Weeks and sometimes months go by without a single sunspot .
Solar scientists have been waiting since December 2008 for signs that sunspot activity is picking up but so far without success .
That has prompted some to speculate that the Earth may be entering another cool period that could offset the warming caused by greenhouse gases trapping heat in the planet 's atmosphere .
Only time will tell , but your correspondent is thankful that any influence of the sun on climate change would be benign .

The Issue
The Interior Department has ruled that wolves have sufficiently increased in numbers in the Western continental United States to allow some wolf hunting there .
The Idaho hunt began on September 1 ; Montana ’s starts on the 15th .
A case might be made for the right to hunt for food and to manage wildlife populations , but surely some of the more than 14,000 people who bought wolf - hunting licenses are interested in neither wolf sandwiches nor animal husbandry : they simply enjoy hunting .
Is it morally acceptable to kill a wolf for the fun of it ?
The Argument
Unsurprisingly , I believe it is wrong to inflict pain and death unnecessarily on a creature capable of suffering .
( Peter Singer more broadly examines the moral standing of animals here . )
While this belief might not compel us to be vegetarians , it does demand significant changes in the way we raise animals for food , and it forbids wolf hunting as a form of entertainment .
To be clear , I concede all putatively practical justifications for hunting and repudiate only the idea that hunting is a legitimate recreation .
It is the person who claims as much who bears the burden of proof — a wolf need not make a case for its not being shot in Montana .
I ’m not persuaded that hunters have made their case .
Some declare that hunting is a cherished tradition in their region or for their family .
But having done something in the past is insufficient to justify its repetition .
It was traditional in my family to be roughed up each spring during pogrom season , a time - honored custom in our part of Russia , and one we gladly abandoned when my grandparents emigrated to America .
Some note that hunting is a challenging activity .
No doubt .
As is juggling flaming axes while blindfolded .
And drunk .
But not everything difficult is desirable .
Or ethical .
Pickpocketing , too , is tough .
There are people who find it fulfilling to cultivate shooting skills , learn to track , take a walk in the woods , maybe bring the kids and make it a bonding experience or bring a couple of buddies and make it a beer - drinking experience or just an opportunity to avoid spending time with the spouse .
All of these might be amiable ways to beguile the time , but none need culminate with a killing .
Inflicting death is not an acceptable leisure activity .
That hunting is widely regarded as a sport is undeniable .
Indeed , an article about the Idaho wolf hunt ran in the sports section of the Los Angeles Times , in a subsection called “ Outposts — outdoors , action , adventure . ”
It sounds like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie .
But this is a curious designation .
In other sports , participation is voluntarily .
No sports fan , enjoying himself at a tailgate party , is knocked out and shanghaied into the Green Bay Packers ’ defensive line , like a sailor impressed into Nelson ’s navy .
But in hunting , the wolf does n’t get a say .
And while there are other sports criticized for cruelty to animals that are involuntary participants — horse racing comes to mind — such diversions are at least potentially amenable to the kind of reforms that improve animal welfare .
What would that even mean in hunting ?
Should we genetically engineer a superwolf and teach it to shoot back ?
( Another Bruckheimer movie . )
In any case , misconduct in one arena does not justify it in another .
Beyond what it inflicts on the wolf — pain , death — hunting damages us .
It coarsens us .
It inures us to suffering .
One measure of a society is how it treats the weak and vulnerable , including animals , including those deemed “ wild ” or outside the bounds of society .
While it is hard to see the grim parade of human history as a march of moral progress , there is something hopeful in Western cultures coming to regard animals not just as property , as things to be used any way we wish , but as beings entitled to legal protection .
We had room for improvement .
As recently as the 18th century , various forms of animal torture were popular entertainments : bull baiting , bear baiting , cock fighting , dog fighting .
Francis Place , the British reformer , writing in 1835 , describes a scene of recreation earlier in the century : “ In the Long Fields were several large ponds ; the amusements here were duck - hunting and badger - baiting ; they would throw a cat into the water and set dogs at her ; great cruelty was constantly practiced and the most abominable scenes used to take place . ” *
The ensuing advance of animal protection law gives us cause for pride .
In 1822 the British passed Richard Martin ’s Act to Prevent the Cruel and Improper Treatment of Cattle , perhaps the world ’s first parliamentary legislation for animal welfare .
In 1835 , the British banned bull and bear baiting as well as cock and dog fighting .
A 1911 measure ratified the legal concept of “ causing unnecessary suffering . ”
It is difficult to see hunting wolves for pleasure as other than a retreat from that ideal .
A coalition of environmental organizations has filed suit in federal court to restore the wolf to the protections of The Endangered Species Act and thereby end the hunts .
The argument in this case is based on ecological , not moral , grounds , but it would be no less gratifying for that if the court found in their favor .
Nor need that outcome be unalloyed bad news for would - be wolf - killers .
If the judge halts the hunt , Montana residents who purchased wolf licenses get their $ 19 back .
* Francis Place , quoted in London Life in the Eighteenth Century , M. Dorothy George , Academy Chicago , 1984 , p 296 .
It 's finally here , set to go to mark - up next Tuesday .
The famous " bipartisan " effort that so far has the support of absolutely no Republicans , including President Sen.
Snowe .
You can read the Chairman 's mark here [ pdf ] .
In Finance tradition , the bill is written in narrative form , rather than legislative form .
All amendments will also be offered in plain English , and then the plain English mark turned into legislative form .
Start reading , and chronicle the debacle in the comments .
Let 's start with this one , on page 2 ( page 5 of the pdf ) , where it establishes that older people could be charged 5 times as much as younger people .
You 're reading that right :
Under the Baucus legislation , private insurers could also charge older individuals up to five times more for coverage .
" You ’re just using age as a proxy for health status , " Uwe Reinhardt , an economics professor at Princeton University told the New York Times .
Reinhardt estimates that " Senator Baucus ’s age - rating plan would allow insurers to cover roughly 70 percent of the additional risk they ’d take on by being required to accept all comers , regardless of health . "
Affordability questions remain paramount throughout the mark , not just for older Americans ( over 55 , not yet eligble for Medicare ) .
Marcy is doing a fantastic job of breaking down the costs for middle America , and the very real possibility that this bill would make American workers captive to their employers :
The individual definition of affordable uses 10 % of Adjusted Gross Income .
Whereas the employer 's definition of affordable uses 13 % of ( apparently ) total income .
Now , it 's a good thing ( sort of ) that the affordability rate for individuals is 10 % of AGI .
That means a family would be able to opt out if there were no health care available at even a lower rate than I thought ( for example , it might mean a middle class family could opt out if health insurance cost them $ 6,000 a year , as opposed to $ 8,000 a year ) .
It 's a bad thing , though , because it means MaxTax would be far from universal - - a lot of middle class families will pretty much have to opt out because they can't afford coverage .
But if your employer offers health care -- even if it covers just 65 % of costs -- then you can't opt - out unless you 're paying out of pocket 13 % of your total income !!
Oh , and to opt - out you have to go to your manager and tell him or her that you 're opting out , which means the employer will be fined ; how many people do you think will be fired rather than opt-out ?
So far the Baucus debacle is very good for Wal - Mart , very good for AHIP , and not so great for the rest of us .
Note as well , there is no employer mandate to provide coverage to workers in this bill .
But what happens when you do n't obtain insurance ( page 29 ) :
Excise Tax .
The consequence for not maintaining insurance would be an excise tax .
If a taxpayer ‘s MAGI [ Adjusted Gross Income ] is between 100-300 percent of FPL [ Federal Poverty Level ] , the excise tax for failing to obtain coverage for an individual in a taxpayer unit ( either as a taxpayer or an individual claimed as a dependent ) is $ 750 per year .
However , the maximum penalty for the taxpayer unit is $ 1,500 .
If a taxpayer ‘s MAGI is above 300 percent of FPL the penalty for failing to obtain coverage for an individual in a taxpayer unit ( either as a taxpayer or as an individual claimed as a dependent ) is $ 950 year .
However , the maximum penalty amount a family above 300 percent of FPL would pay is $ 3,800 .
Right , that 'll bring us to universal coverage .
You can either spend your money by getting trapped in a crappy , expensive insurance policy , or pay the fine .
In general , mandates are a key component of reaching universal coverage , but the mandates have to be accompanied by an affordable , sustainable option .
Which we do n't get in the Baucus debacle .
We get co-ops , that " must not be sponsored by a State , county , or local government , or any government instrumentality . "
The Baucus debacle : as bad as we thought it would be .
And this is just scratching the surface .
There 's plenty more to be had .
Read it yourself , and add your thoughts in the comments .
It 's a question that everyone has asked at one time :
Who controls the internet ?
The answer , of course , is no one .
But just how can this be ?
How is it possible for nearly two billion people to interact with one another every day – posting words , linking videos and tagging photographs – without someone , somewhere making sure it all works properly ?
Part of the explanation lies in the organisation that I am the chief executive of – the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , or Icann .
Icann was formed 11 years ago today through a combined effort of the US government and the technical community that built the network itself .
And today we celebrate the remarkable success of that effort by doing a very unusual thing : ending the agreement that was responsible for our success .
If that sounds counterintuitive , it 's because the power of decentralisation , something that has been lying dormant for thousands of years , has been unleashed by the internet .
Think of the traditional industries and powerful companies that have been humbled by the leaderless , location - less internet .
Seemingly chaotic groups , with constantly changing memberships , have outpaced and out - organised the best structures that business minds have built .
How ?
The answer is by harnessing the power of the individual and by empowering people to make decisions collectively , as opposed to having them handed down to them : coordination over control .
For over a decade , Icann has been the body responsible for coordinating the domain name system – where the words written by humans are attached to numerical addresses used by computers , with the end result that we can type in " google.com " or " icann.org " and end up at a website hosted on some server , somewhere in the world .
In that time , we have seen internet users grow by 20 times , and domain names expand from just over two million to just under 200 million .
It would never have been possible to manage that degree of growth without Icann 's unique structure .
Icann seeks to allow everyone affected by the internet a seat at the table .
We do that through a range of supporting organisations and advisery committees that represent different groups – from governments , to businesses , to the companies that run the domain name infrastructure , to the technical community , to you the average internet user .
In this " multi- stakeholder " environment , we also run a unique decision - making process where the community itself identifies issues of concern , works on them and publishes them for public comment so that everyone else can review and comment .
Only once a broad consensus is reached is the issue put before a board , itself made up of diverse representatives , for a vote .
This structure was not the one Icann started out with , but it is what the community itself has developed through two iterations of structural changes – the result of which is that Icann now incorporates within its bylaws a review cycle of its constituent parts .
The advantage of this joint , collaborative decision - making is not only that many minds are put to work on the same problem but also that the end result is accepted by and acceptable to all parties , making the results all the more powerful .
And it was this collaborative process that was behind the conclusion of Icann 's agreement with the US department of commerce , as well as creating a new affirmation of commitments that puts the global internet community in the driving seat as the ultimate arbiter of Icann 's success .
By using the very skills and processes that Icann has developed and matured , based on a philosophy of coordination and not control , we have an agreement that I believe puts Icann in good stead for the next 11 years .
But if you think that 's the end of the issue , you could not be more wrong .
With the signing of the affirmation of commitments , Icann is now accountable to the global internet community – and that means you , the reader of this article .
If you want to ensure that the internet continues to develop and evolve in a way that makes the most of its enormous potential , it is up to you to get involved and participate within Icann .
I look forward to seeing you help us tackle the next set of issues that this extraordinary network will throw at us .
Getting to grips with 3D
Let 's take a look at the crucial elements of 3D worlds , and how Unity lets you develop games in the third dimension .
Coordinates
If you have worked with any 3D artworking application before , you 'll likely be familiar with the concept of the Z- axis .
The Z - axis , in addition to the existing X for horizontal and Y for vertical , represents depth .
In 3D applications , you 'll see information on objects laid out in X , Y , Z â format this is known as the Cartesian coordinate method .
Dimensions , rotational values , and positions in the 3D world can all be described in this way .
In this book , like in other documentation of 3D , you 'll see such information written with parenthesis , shown as follows : ( 10 , 15 , 10 ) This is mostly for neatness , and also due to the fact that in programming , these values must be written in this way .
Regardless of their presentation , you can assume that any sets of three values separated by commas will be in X , Y , Z order .
Local space versus
World space A crucial concept to begin looking at is the difference between Local space and World space .
In any 3D package , the world you will work in is technically infinite , and it can be difficult to keep track of the location of objects within it .
In every 3D world , there is a point of origin , often referred to as zero , as it is represented by the position ( 0,0,0 ) .
All world positions of objects in 3D are relative to world zero .
However , to make things simpler , we also use Local space ( also known as Object space ) to define object positions in relation to one another .
Local space assumes that every object has its own zero point , which is the point from which its axis handles emerge .
This is usually the center of the object , and by creating relationships between objects , we can compare their positions in relation to one another .
Such relationships , known as parent - child relationships , mean that we can calculate distances from other objects using Local space , with the parent object 's position becoming the new zero point for any of its child objects .
For more information on parent - child relationships , see Chapter 3 .
Vectors Yï » ¿ï » ¿ou'll also see 3D vectors described in Cartesian coordinates .
Like their 2D counterparts , 3 ï » ¿D vectors are simply lines drawn in the 3D world that have a direction and a length .
Vectors can be moved in world space , but remain unchanged themselves .
Vectors are useful in a game engine context , as they allow us to calculate distances , relative angles between objects , and the direction of objects .
Cameras Cï » ¿ï » ¿ameras are essential in the 3D world , as they act as the viewport for the screen .
Having a pyramid - shaped field of vision , cameras can be placed at any point in the world , animated , or attached to characters or objects as part of a game scenario .
Wï » ¿ith adjustable Field of Vision ( FOV ) , 3D cameras are your viewport on the 3D world .
In game engines , you 'll notice that effects such as lighting , motion blurs , and other effects are applied to the camera to help with game simulation of a person 's eye view of the world â you can even add a few cinematic effects that the human eye will never experience , such as lens flares when looking at the sun !
Mï» ¿ost modern 3D games utilize multiple cameras to show parts of the game world that the character camera is not currently looking at â like a ' cutaway ' in cinematic terms .
Unity does this with ease by allowing many cameras in a single scene , which can be scripted to act as the main camera at any point during runtime .
Multiple cameras can also be used in a game to control the rendering of particular 2D and 3D elements separately as part of the optimization process .
For example , objects may be grouped in layers , and cameras may be assigned to render objects in particular layers .
This gives us more control over individual renders of certain elements in the game .
Polygons , edges , vertices , and meshes
In constructing 3D shapes , all objects are ultimately made up of interconnected 2D shapes known as polygons .
On importing models from a modelling application , Unity converts all polygons to polygon triangles .
Polygon triangles ( also referred to as faces ) are in turn made up of three connected edges .
The locations at which these vertices meet are known as points or vertices .
By knowing these locations , game engines are able to make calculations regarding the points of impact , known as collisions , when using complex collision detection with Mesh Colliders , such as in shooting games to detect the exact location at which a bullet has hit another object .
By combining many linked polygons , 3D modelling applications allow us to build complex shapes , known as meshes .
In addition to building 3D shapes , the data stored in meshes can have many other uses .
For example , it can be used as surface navigational data by making objects in a game , by following the vertices .
Iï » ¿ï » ¿n game projects , it is crucial for the developer to understand the importance of polygon count .
The polygon count is the total number of polygons , often in reference to a model , but also in reference to an entire game level .
The higher the number of polygons , the more work your computer must do to render the objects onscreen .
This is why , in the past decade or so , we 've seen an increase in the level of detail from early 3D games to those of today â simply compare the visual detail in a game , such as Id 's Quake ( 1996 ) with the details seen in a game , such as Epic 's Gears Of War ( 2006 ) .
As a result of faster technology , game developers are now able to model 3D characters and worlds for games that contain a much higher polygon count and this trend will inevitably continue .
Materials , textures , and shaders Mï » ¿ï » ¿aterials are a common concept to all 3D applications , as they provide the means to set the visual appearance of a 3D model .
From basic colors to reflective image - based surfaces , materials handle everything .
Sï » ¿ï » ¿tarting with a simple color and the option of using one or more images â known as textures â in a single material , the material works with the shader , which is a script in charge of the style of rendering .
For example , in a reflective shader , the material will render reflections of surrounding objects , but maintain its color or the look of the image applied as its texture .
Iï » ¿ï » ¿n Unity , the use of materials is easy .
Any materials created in your 3D modelling package will be imported and recreated automatically by the engine and created as assets to use later .
You can also create your own materials from scratch , assigning images as texture files , and selecting a shader from a large library that comes built - in .
You may also write your own shader scripts , or implement those written by members of the Unity community , giving you more freedom for expansion beyond the included set .
Crucially , when creating textures for a game in a graphics package such as Photoshop , you must be aware of the resolution .
Game textures are expected to be square , and sized to a power of 2 .
This means that numbers should run as follows : 128 x 128
256 x 256
512 x 512
1024 x 1024 Cï » ¿reating textures of these sizes will mean that they can be tiled successfully by the game engine .
You should also be aware that the larger the texture file you use , the more processing power you 'll be demanding from the player 's computer .
Therefore , always remember to try resizing your graphics to the smallest power of 2 dimensions possible , without sacrificing too much in the way of quality .
Rigid Body physics Fï » ¿ï » ¿or developers working with game engines , pï»¿hysics engines provide an accompanying way of simulating real - world responses for objects in games .
In Unity , the game engine uses Nvidia 's PhysX engine , a popular and highly accurate commercial physics engine .
In game engines , there is no assumption that an object should be affected by physics âfirstly because it requires a lot of processing power , and secondly because it simply does n't make sense .
For example , in a 3D driving game , it makes sense for the cars to be under the influence of the physics engine , but not the track or surrounding objects , such as trees , walls , and so on â they simply do n't need to be .
For this reason , when making games , a Rï» ¿igid Body component is given to any object you want under the control of the physics engine .
Pï » ¿hysics engines for games use the Rigid Body dynamics system of creating realistic motion .
This simply means that instead of objects being static in the 3D world , they can have the following properties :
Mass
Gravity
Velocity
Friction
As the power of hardware and software increases , rigid body physics is becoming more widely applied in games , as it offers the potential for more varied and realistic simulation .
We 'll be utilizing rigid body dynamics as part of our game in Chapter 6 .
Ada turns back the clock
A year - old story about a programming language that fell out of favor 12 years ago takes the Web by storm
GCN.com
When one of the most popular stories of the week on our sister Web site , , is about the Ada programming language , it makes you wonder what the heck is going on — and what year is it anyway ?
Imagine our surprise last week when visitors requested more than 13,000 page views of a story that has been in GCN .
com ’s archives for more than a year .
Its headline , appropriately enough , was “ The return of Ada . ”
As you might remember — or not —
Ada was once the official language of choice at the Defense Department .
Under a 1987 policy , developers working on mission - critical systems had to apply for a waiver to code in C , C++ , Java or other mainstream languages .
It was a sore point for some developers , who complained that Ada was difficult to use and lacked widespread commercial support .
But DOD officials argued that Ada produced programs that were secure and reliable .
As an added bonus , it ’s relatively easy to take code written for one program and reuse it in another , thereby lowering development costs .
But that era ended with an April 29 , 1997 , memo from Lt. Gen. Emmett Paige , then assistant secretary of Defense for command , control , communications and intelligence .
“ Ada should be one of the languages considered in [ the programming ] decision process ; however , Ada waiver requests are no longer required when another language is selected , ” Paige wrote .
Twelve years later , it seemed unlikely that an Ada story would garner thousands of hits in just a few days — especially a story that ’s been online since April 2008 .
Talk about a time warp .
Consider this :
In 1996 , the last full year of Ada ’s reign , one of the big news stories was the arrest of the Unabomber , the top - grossing movie was “ Independence Day ” and the top - selling pop album was “ Jagged Little Pill , ” by Alanis Morissette .
No one talks about Ted Kaczynski anymore , Will Smith has gone on to appear in 16 more movies , and Morissette has recorded a second version of “ Jagged Little Pill , ” this one acoustic .
Here ’s what happened .
In the story , Senior Writer Joab Jackson explains that some programmers still swear by Ada ’s ability to produce reliable , secure programs , just as DOD officials claimed a dozen years ago .
“ Ada never vanished completely , ” Jackson wrote .
“ In fact , in certain communities — notably aviation software — it has remained the programming language of choice . ”
Evidently , someone who missed the story last year stumbled across it a week or so ago and posted a link to it in the programming forum at Reddit , a content - sharing Web site .
Since then , the story has generated more than a hundred comments on Reddit and steered thousands of readers to GCN.com .
It would seem that Reddit readers welcomed the opportunity to debate the virtues of Ada again .
One person suggested that the best programmers tend to choose Ada .
“ Most of the above - average programmers that I have known are usually interested in getting their job done with a minimum of effort and error , ” ldrews wrote .
That observation did n’t sit well with fierarul , who said most programmers get special training to work with Ada because it is so difficult , which helps them become better programmers .
In contrast , most developers learn mainstream languages on their own , sometimes to their detriment .
“ If I were to pour the same amount of time and money into code training , the language difference would diminish by a lot , ” fierarul said .
But all that is just a passing bother from the perspective of Cobol programmers .
The Common Business - Oriented Language , as it is formally known , marks its 50th anniversary this year , and despite the language being written off well before Morissette recorded her first version of “ Jagged Little Pill , ” Cobol programmers are still in demand at federal agencies .
“ Many agencies do want to get off Cobol and build modern systems that will last the next 30 years , ” Brian Robinson reports in this week ’s issue of Federal Computer Week .
“ But those Cobol systems handle such a huge part of the transactional load that they are not easy to change out when so much vital traffic passes through them each day . ”
The story , which begins on Page 30 , is best read by the light of a lava lamp .
Home > Social Issues How the U.S. Subsidizes Offshoring of Jobs
by Bob Powell ,
Printer page
Email article
I was asked :
The U.S.. in effect , subsidizes companies that offshore .
They did n't believe me .
Can you help me explain it ?
My response : I 'm sure I do n't know the full extent of it , but below are only a few of the ways .
3/19/11 .
Added links at the end on plans by right - wing Treasury Secretary Geithner and Republicans for another " tax holiday " for multinational corporations as Republicans did in 2004 .
They let corporations return profits squirreled away in foreign countries to the U.S.
They 're taxed , not at the much - complained - about 35 % tax rate that the multinationals never pay , but at a much lower rate ; in 2004 that " holiday " had a 5.25 % rate !
Such blatant thievery .
While many characterize the changes that would stop the subsidies as protectionism , it 's actually about ending " reverse protectionism . "
Considering the growing U.S. trade deficit , it 's clear that the U.S. does not have a problem with " protectionism " and that , to the contrary , " reverse protectionism " is winning .
Ending " reverse protectionism " is not protectionist .
What 's somewhat amazing is that these subsidies are so entrenched that they 're not even recognized as warping the playing field .
The field is so uneven that it has led to an exponentially - increasing trade deficit that will destroy our economy .
If foreign countries want access to our markets , they can help pay for the systems that support that access .
Summary : Companies can defer paying taxes on income from foreign subsidiaries ... indefinitely .
They lobby for , and get , " tax holidays " that let them pay lesser rates when they bring the money back to the U.S. Republicans got a " tax holiday " for multinational corporations as in 2004 .
They let corporations return profits squirreled away in foreign countries to the U.S.
They 're taxed , not at the much - complained - about 35 % tax rate that the multinationals never pay , but at a much lower rate ; in 2004 that " holiday " had a 5.25 % rate !
Such blatant thievery .
They continue to lobby for another one .
Tax loopholes , such as moving headquarters to a tax haven .
Allowing R&D and other investment tax credits for companies that move manufacturing off shore ... the U.S. does n't fully benefit .
Corporations engage in flawed transfer pricing schemes to avoid U.S. taxes , e.g. , they sell components to foreign subsidiary with very low profit markup , and buy back product after manufacture with a very high foreign profit markup .
Not including labor & environmental standards in trade pacts is a subsidy .
The costs of environmental degradation and injuries to workers are externalized onto the public at large .
Without standards , democracy is undermined : individuals do n't value and " purchase " clean environment & workplace safety , governments do ; if a government is n't a democracy , it does n't represent the interests of its citizens .
Corporations are allowed to write - off the cost of shutting down a factory in the U.S. when it transfers the work to a factory in a foreign country .
Corporations are allowed to write - off the cost of bringing new foreign employees to the U.S. and requiring its U.S. employees , as their last duties before being fired , to train the foreign employees to do their jobs .
Excessively high real interest rates set by the Federal Reserve Board in the 1980s encouraged manufacturing to go offshore , because investing in real assets has yielded lower returns than investing in financial assets .
This led to the leveraged buyouts of the 80s and the weakening of the manufacturing sector .
Businesses avoid taxes whenever they can and they influence legislation to avoid taxes whenever they can .
They leave it to the public at large ( especially to those who work for a wage , rather than those who reap dividends and capital gains ) to pay for the systems and services that allow businesses to make their returns .
And also we compete with other countries , like those in Europe , that provide universal government health insurance which means companies in those countries do not bear that major cost .
For much more detail , see below and in A Systems Thinking Perspective on Manufacturing & Trade Policy :
The ones Kerry notes are ( from http://www.johnkerry.com/pdf/tax_reform.pdf):
1 . Current tax laws allow corporations to defer paying U.S. taxes on income earned by their foreign subsidiaries , providing a substantial tax break for companies that move investment and jobs overseas .
Today , under U.S. tax law , a company that is trying to decide between locating production or services in the United States or in a foreign lowtax haven is actually given a substantial tax incentive not only to move jobs overseas , but to reinvest profits permanently , as opposed to bring them back and re-invest in the United States .
2 . Current international tax loopholes allow American companies to escape taxes by taking advantage of complicated international tax rules .
These abuses include " corporate inversion " where an American company moves its headquarters to a tax haven like Bermuda to avoid taxes , certain types of cross-crediting that encourage companies to shift income and jobs to low - tax havens , restricting tax avoidance through hybrid structures , and other abuses .
These are real , but they are only two of the particularly egregious subsidies .
Here are others I note in A Systems Thinking Perspective on Manufacturing & Trade Policy : 3 . The U.S. allows R&D investment tax credits to companies that do not retain their complementary assets ( e.g. , manufacturing ) in the U.S.
This is a problem because , when a nation that subsidizes an innovation does not retain the manufacturing , it does not fully profit from the innovation .
The nation does not fully profit because it cedes a large portion of the profits to the nations that do the manufacturing .
Continuing such subsidies is a form of " reverse protectionism . "
The dynamic is explained in detail in the section of a Systems Thinking Perspective on Manufacturing Base Restoration on " Why innovation alone is n't enough : Profiting from Technological Innovation " ) .
Here is a summary of Teece 's rationale :
The more easily innovations can be imitated , the more an innovating firm risks ceding a significant share of the returns from innovation to customers , imitators and owners of complementary assets ( e.g. , manufacturing ) .
To prevent this , the innovating firm itself must focus on protectable innovations , focus on products / services for which the necessary complementary assets are already under its control , or establish appropriate plans for contracting / leasing or integrating the necessary complementary assets .
Managers must become adept in understanding their organizations and markets as dynamic systems .
For the same reasons that control of complementary assets , such as manufacturing , are important to companies , they also matter to innovating nations .
In regions of weak appropriability , innovating firms without the requisite manufacturing and other specialized capabilities may fail and , similarly , innovating nations may allow competing nations to capture the lion 's share of the profits from the innovation .
4. Corporations engage in flawed transfer pricing schemes to avoid U.S. taxes .
This distorts accounting of profits and losses .
Transfer pricing is when the U.S. corporation sells , say components to be assembled , to its foreign subsidiary with a very small markup for profit .
Then the foreign subsidiary does further assembly and manufacture and sells the product back to its U.S. corporate parent with a very large markup for profit .
The U.S. company sells the product in the U.S. at a price that yields only a small profit due the high cost to it from its foreign subsidiary .
This allows the foreign subsidiary to retain the profits and pay low taxes in the foreign country compared to taxes that would be paid in the U.S.
The U.S. could require accounting standards that disallow obviously fraudulent transfer pricing schemes whereby corporations move profits to foreign subsidiaries to take advantage of the lower taxes in foreign countries ( resulting from tax wars ) .
Allowing such transfer pricing schemes is a form of " reverse protectionism . "
5. Corporations are allowed to write - off ( deduct the expense ) the cost of shutting down a factory in the U.S. when it transfers the work to a factory in a foreign country .
6 . Corporations are allowed to write - off ( deduct the expense ) the cost of bringing new foreign employees to the U.S. and requiring its U.S. employees , as their last duties before being fired , to train the foreign employees to do their jobs .
7 . Not including labor and environmental standards in trade pacts is a form of subsidy .
This is " reverse protectionism " and a subsidy because the costs of environmental degradation and injuries to workers are externalized onto the public at large .
Just as intellectual property protections protect private capital , labor and environmental standards protect social capital , or quality of life , built up over centuries .
They protect our ability to further increase social capital .
With inadequate trade protections for labor and environmental standards , which must be strictly monitored and enforced , our ( labor and environmental ) social capital is now being undermined and will continue to seriously erode .
Note that " free trade " proponents do n't have a problem working toward enforcing intellectual protection restrictions because they protect private capital , rather than social capital .
In countries without constitutional democracies ( especially in dictatorships ) and without the technical competence and financial means to perform sound science , citizens cannot properly value their environment ; the market does n't set prices for the environment , governments do .
The lack of democracy and effective political institutions affects the ability of nations to make sound economic decisions .
( Thompson and Strohm , 1996 ) :
However , if one does include the environment in the theory of comparative advantage , an important caveat is in order .
This caveat is , of course , that the market does not set prices for the environment and that is , therefore , a task for government .
It is quite possible that the government will price the environment incorrectly ( by which we mean that it fails to require the full internalization of the costs of environmentally harmful practices ) .
If that should happen , then it is still true that countries will tend to export the goods that use intensively factors of production that are relatively cheaper .
But it is no longer true that trade patterns reflect relative scarcity , nor that trade is unambiguously welfare increasing .
Also , developing countries lacking the capability to perform sound science cannot properly evaluate impacts on health and the environment ( Yoshino , et al. , 2002 ) :
8. Excessively high real interest rates set by the Federal Reserve Board is a policy that has encouraged the loss of manufacturing .
The Federal Reserve Board setting excessively high real interest rates ( in the past ) has encouraged manufacturing to go offshore .
Why invest in real assets for returns when one can invest in financial assets ?
This led to the leveraged buyouts of the 80s and the weakening of the manufacturing sector .
( See the section on " The Economic Environment and National Economic Policy " in Systems Thinking Perspective on Manufacturing Base Restoration ) .

But some complain about " excessive corporate taxation "
When it 's proposed that these policies should be reversed , many talk about " excessive corporate taxation . "
But they only get away with that complaint because so many do n't realize the extent to which corporations escape taxes altogether ( see the article below ) .
They get the benefits and pass the costs on to others .
The U.S. allows " tax competition " between the states that have produced large and growing infrastructure backlogs ( $ 1.6 trillion nationally ) .
The tax breaks awarded to corporations are subsidies , the costs of which are passed on to the public at large .
Cutting taxes , that is , engaging in tax competition with other countries and among regions in the U.S. , to attract companies is the standard recommendation of those who wish to promote economic growth .
Indeed , tax competition is lauded by the CATO Institute ( Edwards and de Rugy , 2002 ) , which sees this as a desirable way to limit government .
Tax competition does attract companies and it does limit government , but the consequences are serious .
The result is taxes that are insufficient to cover the long - term costs of roads and schools .
This leads to infrastructure backlogs and calls for even more growth " to increase the tax base " and pay for infrastructure .
Unfortunately , while there is a short - term tax benefit from growth , taxes remain insufficient to cover the long - term costs of growth ; and the cycle continues .
Corporations do n't pay the moaned - about 35 % rate .
Many do n't pay any U.S. taxes at all !
60 % of U.S. firms escaped taxes during boom By John D. Mckinnon , WALL STREET JOURNAL , 4/7/04 WASHINGTON -
More than 60 percent of U.S. corporations did n't pay any federal taxes for 1996 through 2000 , years when the economy boomed and corporate profits soared , the investigative arm of Congress reported .
The disclosures from the General Accounting Office are certain to fuel the debate over corporate tax payments in the presidential campaign .
Corporate tax receipts have shrunk markedly as a share of overall federal revenue in recent years , and were particularly depressed when the economy soured .
By 2003 , they had fallen to just 7.4 percent of overall federal receipts , the lowest rate since 1983 , and the second - lowest rate since 1934 , federal budget officials say .
The GAO analysis of Internal Revenue Service data comes as tax avoidance by both U.S. and foreign companies also is drawing increased scrutiny from the IRS and Congress .
But more so than similar previous reports , the analysis suggests that dodging taxes , both legally and otherwise , has become deeply rooted in U.S. corporate culture .
The analysis found that even more foreign - owned companies doing business in the United States -- about 70 percent of them -- reported that they did n't owe any U.S. federal taxes during the late 1990s .
" Too many corporations are finagling ways to dodge paying Uncle Sam , despite the benefits they receive from this country , " said Sen. Carl Levin , D. , Mich. , who requested the study along with Sen. Byron Dorgan , D. , N.D. " Thwarting corporate tax dodgers will take tax reform and stronger enforcement . "
A 1999 GAO study on corporate tax payments reached similar results .
The latest report has given new ammunition to the campaign of Democratic presidential challenger Sen .
John Kerry , who has criticized President Bush for failing to crack down on corporate tax dodgers .
Kerry wants to end corporations ' ability to park their overseas earnings in tax havens , in order to discourage outsourcing ; in return , he is proposing a lower U.S. corporate tax rate .
To be sure , Kerry has supported some of the most recent big corporate breaks , such as those contained in a 2002 economic stimulus bill .
And the latest GAO report focused on tax avoidance that took place entirely during the Clinton years .
A spokesman for the Bush campaign said Kerry 's own campaign has acknowledged its plan would n't stop outsourcing .
" Sen . Kerry has a habit of putting forth political statements that would n't achieve the policy goals that he says they would , " Bush spokesman Scott Stanzel said .
An IRS spokesman noted that the agency recently has stepped up enforcement activity for business taxpayers .
The Bush administration 's 2005 budget request includes a 10 percent increase for IRS enforcement , mostly to go after more corporations .
The GAO report also may further fuel a drive in Congress to crack down on a variety of corporate tax - dodging strategies , such as a recently discovered leasing maneuver that allows companies to buy up depreciation rights to public transit lines , highways and water systems .
Senate tax - committee leaders have released a list of companies involved that includes a number of well - known financial firms , such as First Union Commercial Corp. , a unit of Wachovia Corp .
Wachovia has defended its involvement , saying the transactions are legal .
The new report also could spur further IRS action against tax - shelter peddlers and their customers .
The IRS is closely examining tax - shelter deals sold by accounting firms such as KPMG LLP , for example .
That firm recently experienced a management shake - up in response to the inquiry .
Conservatives depicted the GAO report as an argument for tax - code overhaul for both corporations and individuals .
Dan Mitchell , a fellow at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , also noted in corporations ' defense that they have an obligation to shareholders to pay as little tax as they legally can .
The basic federal corporate - tax rate for big corporations is 35 percent .
But the federal tax code also offers many credits and loopholes that allow many companies to pay far less than that .
How to they manage to pay far less ?
Here 's one way to make it 5.25 % !
Does tax code send U.S. jobs offshore ?
3/21/2008
At issue is the U.S. tax code 's treatment of profits earned by foreign subsidiaries of American corporations .
Profits earned in the United States are subject to the 35 % corporate tax .
But multinational corporations can defer paying U.S. taxes on their overseas profits until they return them to the USA  transfers that often do n't happen for years .
...
Today 's U.S. tax system encourages corporations to structure their operations to shift profits to low - tax foreign locales such as Ireland , Bermuda or the Netherlands .
That 's especially true for companies that benefit from so - called intangible assets that are difficult to value .
By assigning patents or other licenses to foreign affiliates , corporations can legally book profits in low - tax venues rather than the USA , economists say .
Ireland 's appeal Evidence of legal tax - shifting can be seen in government statistics .
In 2005 , U.S. multinationals ' units in Ireland , which levies a corporate tax of just 12.5 % , reported profits that were twice as large as the profits of all U.S. affiliates in Germany , France and Italy combined .
...
Regarding " transfers " returning profits to the USA :
They 'll keep profits there until they get a " tax holiday " that lets them bring back profits at an extremely low tax rate ... 5.25 % !!!
Trillion - dollar Tax Holiday Sought by Multinationals by Bob Adelmann , 3/18/11 .
Claiming that granting a " tax holiday " for her company ( and other large multinationals ) would be beneficial to the United States , Oracle President Safra Catz said that such a holiday would allow earnings sitting in idle accounts abroad to be repatriated  and freed up for better use here in the United States .
 It s an absolute no - brainer ,  she said .
If the money flows back to the United States , " it will create jobs . "
If it stays where it is , it will wind up " funding everybody elses economies and banks . " ...
In 2004 , a multinational tax holiday was enacted , and 843 corporations repatriated some $ 362 billion in profits from their foreign operations , generating nearly $ 20 billion in revenues for the Treasury .
The opportunity was especially attractive because the tax rate was reduced from the usual 35 percent rate to just 5.25 percent if the companies acted within a year of passage of the act .
Sure , it 's a no- brainer for multinationals like Oracle .
They complain about a nominal 35 % rate that they never pay thanks to write - offs and keeping profits offshore .
And Republicans are gearing up to promote the thievery : Congress Considers  Tax Holiday  for Corporations 2/13/11 ...
This week , Treasury Secretary Timother Geithner addressed an issue that s been making the rounds which would give multinational companies a tax break .
In the midst of all of the clamoring about lowering the corporate tax rates in the US ( since were second only to Japan in terms of the highest tax rates ) , US lawmakers are considering throwing corporations yet another bone : a tax holiday .
Heres the deal .
Under existing law , US companies can more or less stash cash in offshore companies for eons and not have to pay tax on it until they repatriate it .
This is , of course , not at all the case for individuals , as you are no doubt aware due to the current witch hunt stepped up efforts by the IRS to find unreported individual offshore accounts .
But companies have a different set of rules .
By most estimates , US companies have stockpiled earnings of more $ 1 trillion  roughly the size of the current federal deficit .
That s a lot of cash that wed like to see here , no ?
So GOP leaders have come up with an idea to get those companies to bring back the cash : lower the tax rate .
Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) and Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) are said to be proposing a tax holiday  which would temporarily drop the corporate tax rate for the purposes of expatriation .

Today ’s puzzle is about some code behaving horribly wrong .
Recently , I was working on some operating system project and hacking on the code to switch between privileged and non-privileged mode .
I could switch modes successfully and intercept traps when in non-privileged mode .
Then I wanted to check whether I could handle timer interrupts correctly , so I added this to my non-privileged code , to give the timer interrupt a chance to fire :
volatile int i ; for ( i=0 ; i<10000 ; i++ ) ;
Timer interrupts were handled correctly and eventually returned to the non-privileged code – but the delay code turned into an infinite loop !
I changed to loop to count only to 10 , and I changed it to count down instead of up , but the result remained the same .
I looked at the generated assembly .
It looked like this :
movl $ 10 , 0xfc( %ebp ) // i = 10 jmp 1 f // goto 1 2 : movl 0xfc( %ebp ) , %eax // %eax = i decl %eax // %eax -- movl %eax , 0xfc( %ebp ) // i = %eax 1 : movl 0xfc( %ebp ) , %eax // %eax = i testl %eax , %eax // if ( %eax > 0 ) jg 2 b // goto 2
It looked fine .
On every timer interrupt , I dumped %eax , and it was stuck at 10 .
I debugged my pusha / popa code to save and restore registers between modes , and it was okay .
I debugged my flag handing code , and flags were fine .
Then I replaced my C code with the generated assembly code and added instructions that copied the value of %eax before the “ decl ” into %ebx , and after the “ decl ” into %ecx and added a trap instruction right after that to have privileged mode print out the values of the three registers .
movl $ 10 , 0xfc( %ebp ) // i = 10 jmp 1 f // goto 1 2 : movl 0xfc( %ebp ) , %eax // %eax = i movl %eax , %ebx // value before decl %eax // %eax -- movl %eax , %ecx // value after TRAP movl %eax , 0xfc ( %ebp ) // i = %eax 1 : movl 0xfc( %ebp ) , %eax // %eax = i testl %eax , %eax // if ( %eax > 0 ) jg 2 b // goto 2
The result was %eax = %ebx = %ecx = 10 .
This is when I understood what was going on .
Please share your comments below . :-)
The paper bills in our wallet are not money .
And they are not Notes as in " Federal Reserve Note " written on the top of the bill .
They are actually just Tokens .
Federal Reserve Tokens , if you like , is what should be written on top of the bills .
They are not redeemable for anything other than themselves .
And they represent only one thing :
Your belief in their value .
Hopefully , your belief extends to the next person you try to give them to .
The only real use for them is paying your taxes to either the state or federal government .
You can be sure , however , that both will stop accepting them as payment even for taxes if you and I stop believing in the paper bills .
Paper money , or fiat , was originally accepted because you could redeem the paper for gold upon request .
When people got used to the paper they felt more and more comfortable and were less likely to redeem it for their gold .
They knew that they could redeem it at any time and the paper is lighter , more convenient and can be denominated in much smaller increments so that everyday transactions are made more practical .
By the time the gold imparts this trust to the paper the people storing the gold start using it for other purposes .
The primary other purpose is to start using the gold as someone elses money in addition to yours .
When that happens the banker has now , in effect , doubled the amount of gold in his vault and is only in trouble if you decide to reclaim your gold .
By that time many more people are storing their gold with the banker and he found that only a small percentage of people ever reclaimed their gold .
What Has Government Do ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 1.83 Buy New $ 25.00 ( as of 08:05 EST - Details )
Now , at this point in the story nothing wrong has happened as long as :
You are told that your gold deposit is being lent out .
You are paid for storing your gold .
Your are not charged under the guise of a storage fee because the gold is no longer being stored by the banker .
There is a 1 - to - 1 relationship between the gold you lent the banker and the gold the banker has lent out .
Christians do not believe in charging interest to other Christians .
But , even the Bible describes the business of lending while warning that " The borrower is a slave of the lender . "
The Mystery of Banking Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 2.23 Buy New $ 7.57 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
In the business of lending the difference between what you receive for the use of your gold and what the banker receives for lending it out is his legitimate profit .
After all , if you dont want the banker to lend it out then you can lend it out yourself and do all the work associated .
More importantly , the gold is not taken out of circulation and can be used as legitimate capital for the borrower to invest in his ideas to create even more value for everyone .
As you might suspect , this is not how the story goes .
When the number of people who were likely to reclaim their gold was discovered then the banker could start to guess the amount of gold to keep on hand to make all his depositors believe he was storing their gold .
This number becomes his required reserve ratio and fractional reserve banking is born .
The banker has used a combination of your gold , your trust in him and your infrequent need to reclaim your gold to pretend he has many times more money than the amount of gold that is actually stored with him .
And since he is most likely not fulfilling the four requirements , above , he is probably charging you a storage fee , not paying you , not telling you hes lent it out and is lending out much more gold than his depositors have deposited .
Even worse , the banker lends out gold that doesnt exist and charges interest on the loan .
The banker is now generating interest income on gold that he doesnt have and that doesnt exist .
Fractional reserve lending is born .
Heres a video that describes how money is loaned into existence in todays world .

The Best of Terence Gillespie
By Kev Geoghegan
Entertainment Reporter , BBC News
Carlyle is starring in the new sci- fi series Stargate : Universe Robert Carlyle has told the BBC that director Danny Boyle is ' edging closer ' to making Porno , the follow - up to his 1996 hit film Trainspotting .
Carlyle , who played Begbie in the film , said he would " jump through hoops of fire backwards " for the film - maker and would " do Porno tomorrow for nothing . "
The novel , by Irvine Welsh , picks up on the same characters 10 years later .
But Ewan McGregor , who played anti-hero Renton , has said in interviews that a sequel would be a " terrible shame " .
McGregor is currently starring opposite George Clooney in The Men Who Stare At Goats , which will be screened at this year 's London Film Festival .
Boyle won best director and best picture at this year 's Oscars for Slumdog Millionaire .
He and McGregor have not worked together since 1997's A Life Less Ordinary , when the pair famously fell out over Boyle 's big screen adaptation of Alex Garland 's novel , The Beach .
" More mileage " But Carlyle , who also starred in The Beach , said " For me personally , I would jump through hoops of fire backwards for Danny Boyle .
I would do Porno tomorrow for nothing . "
He added his character from Trainspotting , the psychotic Francis Begbie , was " probably the only character I would ever want to revisit because I do believe that there 's an awful lot more mileage there in Begbie . "
So far McGregor has shown little enthusiasm for a Trainspotting sequel
He said : " I think there is lots more entertainment to be had from that group of people so I would be up for it , and I know Danny seems to be edging more towards it .
" After his success at the Oscars , he should be able to pretty much do as he wants . "
Boyle himself has suggested recently that a Porno script is in development .
Carlyle is the star of the newest spin - off series from the sci-fi Stargate franchise , playing Dr Nicholas Rush in Stargate : Universe .
It is set in the present day and follows an exploration team on the spaceship Destiny who are suddenly transported to a distant corner of the universe .
He says viewers are " never sure about Rush 's motives " .
" He 's responsible for marooning people on this alien craft and then calmly tells them they have no hope of ever getting back . "
The show begins on Sky One at 2000 BST on 6 October .

This week marks the 40th anniversary of the Manson Family 's murder of pregnant actress Sharon Tate , and her friends , at her California home .
After serving 39 years in prison , two women convicted for the murder are seeking parole this month .
The clip above is from the 1973 documentary Manson , which featured interviews with some of the female family members , as well as footage shot by the family , in which they explain Charles ' philosophy and the Family 's way of life .
( Squeaky Fromme , seen in the clip , had no involvement in the Tate / LaBianca murders , but was convicted of attempted assassination of the president , for which she served 34 years .
She will be released on August 16 .
She is still believed to be a follower of Manson's . )

Susan Atkins

THEN : Atkins , aka " Sadie , " was a 21 - year - old mother of a 10 - month - old baby the night she stabbed pregnant Sharon Tate to death , saying , " She asked me to spare her .
I told her I did n't have any mercy for her , " and that Sharon 's whining got on her nerves .
( Atkins ' son , Zezozose Zadfrack Glutz , has since been adopted and renamed . )
Also involved in the LaBianca and Hinman murders , Sadie was sentenced to death in 1971 , ( which was automatically commuted to life in prison after a 1972 California Supreme Court case that outlawed the use of capital punishment ) .
Her cellmate said of her , " Sadie was so far out , even the bull dykes would n't mess with her . "
In 1974 , she removed herself from the Family and became a born - again Christian .
In 1977 she published her autobiography , Child of Satan , Child of God .
NOW : Atkins , now 61 , has been married twice while in prison .
She has been denied parole 17 times .
In 2002 , she filed a lawsuit with the federal court claiming she was a " political prisoner " due to the parole denials despite her suitability .
Atkins is currently dying of cancer — and reportedly can only turn her head from side to side , and move one arm — and her husband has asked that she be released and allowed to die at home , arguing that it would save the state $ 10,000 a day in health care .
Her next parole hearing is scheduled for September 2 .
Leslie Van Houten

THEN : The onetime homecoming queen joined up with the Family shortly after graduating high school in 1967 .
At 19 , she was the youngest defendant in the Tate / LaBianca murders .
Having only been involved in the LaBianca murders ( she stabbed Rosemary LaBianca 16 times ) , she said she wished she had been there the night of the Tate murders .
Van Houten would giggle during testimony , thus lost the sympathy of the jurors .
She was convicted of murder and sentenced to death , later commuted to life in prison .
Three years after her imprisonment she fell away from Manson and the Family .
She won a retrial in 1977 on the grounds of ineffective representation by counsel .
While out on bail in 1978 she attended the Oscars with a friend , and was n't recognized .
She was later convicted again and sentenced to life in prison .
Advertisement
NOW : Van Houten , who will turn 60 this month , is in the California Institution for Women , where she 's spent the past 39 years .
While there , she 's become a model prisoner .
She 's taught other illiterate inmates to read , stitched a portion of the AIDS quilt , made bedding for the homeless , and recorded books on tape for the blind , all while holding down various jobs as a clerk for different members of the prison staff .
Of her remorse over the murders she says , " It 's not easy .
If anything , the older I get , the harder it is .
I took away all that life . "
Filmmaker John Waters began what turned into a close friendship with Van Houten in 1985 when he attempted to interview for her Rolling Stone .
Van Houten — whom Waters described " looked then , and still does , very much like actress Hilary Swank " — has been denied parole 18 times .
During one parole hearing , a judge told her , " You 've dug yourself quite a hole and it 's going to take a little time to get out of it . "
Waters asks , " Can you ever dig your way out of that hole by trying to explain LSD to a parole board whose members have never taken a trip ? "
She is eligible for parole again this year .
Patricia Krenwinkel
Advertisement
THEN : Krenwinkel was 20 when she joined up with Manson .
Two years later , she participated in both the Tate and LaBianca murders ( specifically , stabbed Abagail Folger to death ) and is the one who notoriously wrote in blood on the walls of the LaBianca home , " DEATH TO PIGS " and " HeaLter SkeLTter . "
She was sentenced to death , later commuted to life in prison .
Advertisement
NOW : Like Van Houten , Krenwinkel is active with prison programs .
She 's in AA and NA , and has also taught illiterate prisoners how to read , gives dance lessons , and participates in a service - dog training program .
She has been denied parole 11 times .
Mary Brunner
Advertisement
THEN : Charles Manson 's third wife , and mother of his child Michael Valentine Manson ( aka " Pooh Bear " ) .
She was arrested and jailed for credit card fraud the night of the Tate murders .
She was later charged ( with two other family members ) for the July 1969 murder of Gary Hinman .
She received immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying against Atkins and Beausoleil .
( She later repudiated her statements . )
In 1971 , Brunner — along with several other Family members — was arrested and convicted for taking part in the robbery of a gun store and subsequent shootout with the cops .
She served six years in the California Institution for Women , where Leslie Van Houten , Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel were serving their time .
NOW : After her release from prison , she disassociated herself from the Family , regained custody of her son , changed her name and now lives in anonymity somewhere in the Midwest .

Linda Kasabian
Advertisement
THEN : Kasabian had the only valid driver 's license of all the Family members , so she was ordered to drive the group to the Tate residence , and the LaBianca residence .
( It 's bizarre that they cared about traffic laws . )
She later turned state 's evidence against the Family , and testified at their trials .
NOW : She has refused an media interviews in the past , aside from one for A Current Affair in 1989 , but on September 7 , as a way to mark the 40th anniversary of the Tate / LaBianca murders , the History channel will air a special on the Family , featuring a new , and extensive interview with Kasabian .

Richard Stallman ( younger days )
Summary : Richard Stallman is smeared for pretty much saying it like it is
Miguel de Icaza and his online friend Jason Perlow ( they occasionally spoke before ) seem to be on some sort of subtle attack on Richard Stallman .
Perlow wrote a trollish post for ZDNet [ 1 , 2 ] and de Icaza now portrays himself as a poor victim who is only looking for love .
There is little reference ( or none ) to what led to Stallman 's remarks about de Icaza and the very rational , factual explanation of why Mono means trouble .
As Sam Varghese puts it , Stallman merely “ comes under attack again ” .
Apparently , Stallman is not permitted to defend Free software from Microsoft .
It appears to be open season for launching attacks on the head of the Free Software Foundation , Richard Matthew Stallman , the man who is in large measure responsible for the status that free and open source software enjoys today .
The latest attack on Stallman is a lengthy post by ZDNet blogger Jason Perlow and is based on remarks that Stallman is said to have made during the Free Software Day celebrations in Boston .
Other people followed these attacks on Stallman , but some are Freedom - apathetic ( power preceding Freedom ) .
A lot of them have always disliked Stallman in the first place .
In his new blog , Bruce Byfield puts it politely , but others are obviously trying to dethrone Stallman , calling it dogmatism ( missing the whole point about Mono , which is a fundamental risk to Free software , not reason for “ dogmatism ” ) , et cetera et cetera .
At Identi.ca , Stallman received the support of people , one of whom writes : “ I know what @RMS thinks , because I read the blog post quoting the tweet that quoted a person who was there .
And I am outraged ! ”
Truth be told , here is how another person put it : “ #RMS is pretty bad as a diplomatic , alt [ h ] ough he ’s a visionary indeed .
I hope people can understand the message by above the way ”
Here is another take from a blog post :
RMS tends to call a spade a spade and he does not accept fluff as substance .
M$ ’s posturing as being open to FLOSS is absurd .
No matter how many millions they contribute to FLOSS , they are not a friend of FLOSS - loving people .
Repeatedy they have shown a willingness to buy out the competition rather than to out - compete .
RMS is not a great diplomat but neither is he often wrong .
Free software supporters still do not want Mono .
It was never particularly popular , to say the least .
The same goes for Moonlight .
Now that Silverlight comes to Linux ( Moblin , at least initially [ 1 , 2 ] ) , people wonder what Moonlight was made for at all .
Microsoft explains it like this :
According to a blog entry from Microsoft ’s Silverlight team , the initiative will complement their work with Novell ’s open source port of Silverlight for Linux , Moonlight .
Jason from Mono -Nono has another explanation :
Novell shocked to be undermined .
Everyone else points and laughs .
So , the news is out that Microsoft is bringing real Silverlight to Moblin .
This is not Moonlight , this is the real - deal Silverlight 3 in a joint effort with Intel for Atom - based platforms .
A very interesting development . [...]
Note Microsoft claims “ we ” ( meaning Novell and Microsoft ) are building Moonlight .
Microsoft says Moonlight is a Microsoft project .
I whole - heartedly agree that it is a “ clear extension ” of Microsoft ’s current efforts .
That is phase 2 , after all .
In another new post , Jason explains once again the motivations behind Microsoft ’s CodePlex Foundation [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] :
Microsoft man Sam Ramji reveals some of the Codeplex Foundation ’s motivations .
In responding to the devestating criticism of the Codeplex Foundation ’s fundamentally flawed organization and the high skepticism of its motives , Mr. Ramji revealed a bit of the true motives behind the Codeplex Foundation : Look at projects related to Mono , you also can look at NUnit , NHibernate , we really feel optimistic that the Foundation could help them gain a higher level of credibility in the open source community .
They feel they have been lacking that strong moral support .
Break that down and chew on it a bit !
Mr. Ramji is saying you know those Microsoft - approved “ Open Source ” projects like Mono ?
And you know how the Open Source community keeps rejecting them ?
Well Microsoft is going to create our own playing field and support them ! [...]
Microsoft is not new at leveraging its considerable resources into creating a rubber - stamp pre-approved situation , especially when the real and existing community does n’t want anything to do with Microsoft ’s offerings – < cough > OOXML < / cough > – and the CodePlex Foundation is just another example of that .
The very idea that Microsoft can even set up an independent Open Source foundation is absolutely ludicrious .
Pick any absurd analogy you like : Yankees fans setting up a Red Sox Appreciation Society , the Klan setting up a Civil Rights commission , Nickleback fans setting up a music appreciation group , whatever .
Here is another new report about Sam Ramji and Microsoft ’s CodePlex Foundation :
Microsoft ’s CodePlex Foundation leader soaks in stinging critique
In response to criticism from a leading expert on forming consortia , the interim president of Microsoft ’s CodePlex Foundation , Sam Ramji , says the open source group is in a “ beta ” phase for its first 100 days and is welcoming all forms of evaluation and critique of its bylaws and governance model .
One KDE developer offers this reminder of why Microsoft ’s supposed “ openness ” is still an unfulfilled promise .
But there are MS Access proprietary file formats ( mdb , accdb ) that remain to be secret .
These are not planned to be replaced by XML formats ( what would be overkill in databases ) .
I guess there was no pressure to open the formats , what looks like an overlook in EU and the USA ( correct me if there ’s another reason like patents ) .
If you google for that , it is hard to find even a single mention of file format specifications in the above meaning , and even explanations from MS employees or backers show that they do not fully realize one thinf : MSA formats are not covered by the process of said “ opening of the legacy formats ” .
How timely a reminder of how “ open ” Microsoft truly is .
In conclusion , rather than attacking Stallman , people ought to learn why he reacted as he did .
It is a matter of self defense — he is defending our freedom . █
“ Value your freedom or you will lose it , teaches history .
“ Do n’t bother us with politics , ” respond those who do n’t want to learn . ”

Building payment platforms is one of key challenges facing news organisations , says Financial Times editor Lionel Barber
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
The Financial Times editor , Lionel Barber , has predicted that " almost all " news organisations will be charging for online content within a year .
Barber said building online platforms that could charge readers on an article - by - article or subscription basis was one of the key challenges facing news organisations .
" How these online payment models work and how much revenue they can generate is still up in the air , " Barber said in a speech at at a Media Standards Trust event at the British Academy last night .
" But I confidently predict that within the next 12 months , almost all news organisations will be charging for content . "
Barber is the latest leading executive to suggest the newspaper industry has to radically overhaul its existing business model .
Rupert Murdoch said in May that he expected his News Corporation newspaper websites to start charging for access within a year .
The News Corp chairman and chief executive said free newspaper websites were a " flawed " business model .
Murdoch 's rival , the New York Times , could begin charging for online news within the next three to four weeks .
Barber said last night that the Financial Times had pioneered the concept of a " frequency model " , giving access to a limited number of articles on the web before asking users to subscribe .
" We are seeing sustained and growing revenue as a result of our strategy of premium pricing for quality , niche global content – crucial at a time of weakening advertising , " he added .
" Many news organisations are following suit in charging , latterly the New York Times which had previously come down in favour of free access to its own content . "
The Financial Times website , FT.com , has more than 1.3 million non-paying registered users worldwide , with another 110,000 paying subscribers .
Barber said he had not come to " preside over a wake " but to make some " modest suggestions on how good journalism can not only survive but thrive in the digital age " .
He said the new digital world " poses a threat but also an enormous opportunity to established news organisations " , and warned that the " mediocre middle " was most at risk .
Barber made a distinction between " crafted " journalism and blogs " largely based on opinion rather than established fact [ and ] becoming increasingly influential in setting the news agenda " .
" Bloggers have broken important stories and will continue to do so , " he said .
But he said they " do not operate according to the same standards as those who aspire to and practise crafted journalism .
They are often happy to report rumour as fact , arguing that readers or fellow networkers can step in to correct those " facts " if they turn out to be wrong .
They are rarely engaged in the pursuit of original news : their bread and butter is opinion and comment . "
" I do not wish to sound precious .
British journalism has always put a premium on the scoop and it has long blurred the distinction between news and comment , " said Barber .
" The rise of bloggers may simply signal the last gasp of the age of deference , not just in politics but also in general social mores in Britain , America and elsewhere .
Nor does it follow that the worldwide web has dumbed down journalism .
" On the contrary : it has created opportunities to " smarten up " .
News organisations with specialist skills and knowledge have the opportunity to thrive .
The mediocre middle is much more at risk . "

Wir sind täglich neuen Versuchen der Manipulation ausgesetzt – sehr wirksamen , wie man am Beispiel des Afghanistan - Einsatzes und der ausbleibenden Sanktionen gegenüber unseren Führungspersonen studieren kann .
Zwar lesen wir immer wieder , es gebe eine Mehrheit in Deutschland gegen den militärischen Einsatz in Afghanistan .
Aber diese Mehrheit schlägt sich nicht wirklich in Ablehnung gegenüber den Hauptverantwortlichen nieder .
– Die Reaktion der Bundeskanzlerin und der anderen Verantwortlichen auf das Bombardement der Tanklastzüge zeigt , wie die Meinung in den Medien und unter uns gemacht werden muss , um Sanktionen zu minimieren .
Albrecht Müller
Die Methoden der Manipulation sind bei uns kein öffentliches Thema .
Die Mehrheit kennt sie nicht und durchschaut sie nicht , obwohl es sich dabei um ziemlich einfach zu erkennende Tricks handelt , die wir teilweise sogar aus unserem Alltagsleben kennen .
Aus diesem Grund ist in „ Meinungsmache .
Wie Wirtschaft , Politik und Medien uns das Denken abgewöhnen wollen “ diesen Methoden ein eigenes Kapitel gewidmet ( Kapitel 10 ) und wird dann bei der Beschreibung der Möglichkeiten zum Aufbau einer Gegenöffentlichkeit darauf Bezug genommen .
Hierzu der Auszug aus „ Meinungsmache “ , Seite 426 bis 428 :
Die Methoden der Manipulation kennen und durchschauen Auch unter Gleichgesinnten ist es nicht leicht , skeptisch zu sein .
Der Kopf rät zum Misstrauen , und das Gefühl verlangt nach Vertrauen .
Zum Zweifeln muss man sich entschließen und es gemeinsam mit anderen systematisch betreiben .
Dabei hilft die Kenntnis der Methoden der Manipulation , die oben ausführlich beschrieben sind : Wiederholung .
Zum Beispiel : » Demographischer Wandel und Globalisierung sind die beiden großen Herausforderungen « oder : » Die Finanzkrise kam aus Amerika « .
Eine Botschaft wird von verschiedenen , sich unterscheidenden Absendern ausgesendet .
Dann wird sie glaubwürdiger .
Nutzung des guten Klangs eines Wortes für einen anderen Zweck .
Bestes Beispiel : » Reform « .
Gruppenspezifischer Jargon .
» Freiheit « , » Leistung muss sich wieder lohnen « – solche Floskeln haben zwar kaum einen Bezug zur Realität , aber um bei der Mehrheit der üblichen Talkshowgäste oder beim Auditorium von Guido Westerwelle zu bestehen , reichen die Signale .
Affirmativ auftreten .
Das können Angela Merkel und Peer Steinbrück wie auch schon Gerhard Schröder herausragend gut .
Sie können belanglose Sachen als höchst bedeutsam verkaufen und Falsches als völlig richtig erscheinen lassen .
Die selbstverständliche Gültigkeit in der Sprache anklingen lassen .
» Wie wir alle wissen « , » wie schon bekannt ist « , …
Auf Experten berufen .
Die gängige Methode bei Börsensendungen , Wirtschaftsnachrichten und vielen anderen Foren .
» Tina « :
There is no alternative .
» Es gibt keine Alternative . «
Pars pro toto .
Was für einen
Teil gilt , wird auf die Gesamtheit als gültig übertragen .
Übertreibung .
» Wortbruch « , » Freiheit statt Sozialismus « , » Gnadefür die 68er « – Motto : Irgendwas bleibt immer hängen .
Mit der Botschaft B wird die Botschaft A transportiert .
Bewusst und unterbewusst und erst recht geplant wird diese Methode häufig eingesetzt .
Der ( strategisch geplante ) Konflikt zwischen zwei Personen als Transportband für eine zu vermittelnde Meinung .
Verschweigen , weglassen , ausblenden .
Das gilt unter anderemfür die gesamten Fehler der Regierung Kohl und ihrer Berater bei der Gestaltung der deutschen Vereinigung , insbesondere der wirtschaftspolitischen Entscheidungen .
Umfragen nutzen , um Meinung zu machen .
Dieses Instrument wird ständig gebraucht .
Achten Sie einmal darauf , was » Stern « und » Spiegel Online « mit Hilfe von Forsa - Umfragen anstellen .
Geradezu » mustergültig« .
Wer diese Tipps kennt und beachtet , wird Meinungsbildungsvorgänge leichter durchschauen .
Das ist eine wichtige Basis für den Aufbau einer Gegenöffentlichkeit .
In der jüngsten Debatte um den Afghanistan Einsatz und speziell um das Bombardement können Sie gleich eine Reihe der skizzierten Methoden wieder entdecken :
Die Bundeskanzlerin tritt affirmativ und aggressiv auf .
Sie verbittet sich eine Vorverurteilung .
Mit scharfen Worten an die Kritiker übertüncht sie die Erfolglosigkeit des Einsatzes und die Ratlosigkeit auf Seiten des Westens und der NATO .
Sie greift andere NATO - Länder an .
Steinmeier greift zusätzlich die Linksfraktion an . – Konflikt als Transportmittel der Botschaft , recht zu haben .
Alle etablierten Bundestagsparteien behaupten weiter , was sie bisher immer behauptet haben : der Afghanistan - Einsatz sei notwendig gewesen .
Westerwelle lobt Angela Merkel mit der zur Manipulation notwendigen Übertreibung : „ Sie habe für Deutschland gesprochen . “
Und Westerwelle weiter : „ Das ist kein Wahlkampfmanöver .
Hier geht es um unser Land . “ – Wenn die Behauptung von der Richtigkeit des Afghanistan - Einsatzes aus verschiedenen Ecken , von FDP und SPD , von CDU und Grünen in gleicher Weise vorgetragen wird , dann fällt es der Mehrheit der Menschen schwer , daran zu zweifeln , und noch schwerer , die politischen Konsequenzen zu ziehen , also diesen Parteien die Gefolgschaft aufzukündigen .
Es gibt keine Alternative – so wird einvernehmlich behauptet .
Mit Botschaft B. die Botschaft A. bestätigen – das gelingt meisterhaft z.B. mit einem Satz , dessen Wahrheitsgehalt man nicht hinterfragen darf , der aber als Kombination aus zwei Satzteilen jenseits der Logik schon sitzt : „ Wir sind in unser Engagement nicht kopflos hineingestolpert , können deshalb auch nicht einfach kopflos heraus . “
Das ist eine meisterhafte Manipulation .
Mit dem zweiten Teilsatz wird der erste Teilsatz als richtig unterstellt , und mit dem ersten Teilsatz der Sinn des zweiten belegt .
Es ist ja alles andere als richtig , dass die Bundesregierung nicht kopflos hineingestolpert sei .
Sie hat kopflos die These übernommen , dass der Terror des 11 .
September vor allem von Afghhanistan ausgegangen sei und dass es deshalb einen Sinn mache , sich dort militärisch zu engagieren .
Sie hat kopflos die These vertreten , unsere Sicherheit werde am Hindukusch verteidigt .
Zentrale Fragen und Antworten werden verschwiegen : Ist unser Land und unser Leben durch das militärische Engagement am Hindukusch sicherer geworden ?
Haben wir eine politische Formation in Afghanistan und mit Karzai eine Person unterstützt , die unseren Werten entsprechen ?
Drogendealer , Wahlfälscher , finanziell interessierte Oberschichten und Warlords ?
Ist der Einsatz ein Erfolg , wenn die NATO - Militärs jetzt immer mehr erkennbar im wesentlichen nur noch sich selbst schützen ?
Welche Auswirkungen hatte das militärische Engagement auf die Möglichkeiten ziviler Hilfe ?
Wenn
Sie die auch bei diesem
Thema angewandten Methoden der Meinungsmache durchschauen , dann gelingt ihnen auch die Befreiung von der betriebenen Manipulation .
Unsere Anregung : mit anderen über die angewandten Methoden sprechen , die Debatte mithilfe dieses Suchrasters weiterverfolgen .
Das ist gerade bei diesem
Thema wichtig , weil wir genauso kopflos wie bei der Entscheidung für den Afghanistan - Einsatz in noch viel gefährlichere Einsätze getrieben werden könnten , so z.B. im Fall Iran oder Pakistan .
Übrigens : Der Rückzug ist nicht einfach .
Aber wenn man wie die etablierten Parteien das konstruktive Nachdenken darüber ächtet , wird man auch keine konstruktiven Lösungen finden .
Und diese vielleicht auch gar nicht finden wollen .
Von Steinmeier gab es in der Debatte einen Schlüsselsatz : Dass viele nun raus wollten aus Afghanistan könne er nachvollziehen .
Aber dies sei unpolitisch und unhistorisch und deshalb nicht zu verantworten .
Man dürfe nicht vergessen , berichtet die TAZ über Steinmeiers Rede am 9 .
September , dass „ das Nein zu Irak und das Ja zu Afghanistan zusammengehören . “
Wir sind also nicht um unserer Sicherheit und der Menschen in Afghanistan willen dort militärisch engagiert , sondern den USA , Großbritannien und vermutlich der gesamten NATO zuliebe – und als Wiedergutmachung , weil wir Nein zum Irakkrieg gesagt hatten .
Around 1,000 children in Britain are among the first to be given a vaccine for swine flu .
Over the next two weeks the kids will be testing out which drugs work best to protect against the illness .
The idea is that everyone will be given this medicine to stop them from catching swine flu .
The children aged between six months and 12 years are being tested at five different places Oxford , Bristol , Southampton , Exeter and London .
Scientists will be looking at the results between two different drugs to see which one should be given out to the rest of the population .
The UK government has ordered around 60 million doses of the swine flu vaccine and are expecting to start giving it to people in October .
MONTGOMERY --
The Alabama Supreme Court ruled against Love Stuff , a Hoover business that sells vibrators and other sexual devices , and upheld Alabama 's anti-obscenity law .
The court ruled that the business failed to show that the state law banning the sale of sexual aides was unconstitutional .
" Public morality can still serve as a legitimate rational basis for regulating commercial activity , which is not a private activity , " Supreme Court justices wrote in the opinion issued Friday .
" As the Eleventh Circuit in Williams IV pithily and somewhat coarsely stated : ' There is nothing ' private ' or ' consensual ' about the advertising and sale of a dildo . "
Love Stuff had argued a section of Alabama 's anti-obscenity law banning " adult - only entertainment " near churches and child care centers was unconstitutional vague because the phrase was not defined .
" We 're not closing , " said Love Stuff attorney Amy Herring .
She said the store is reviewing its options for appeal .
She said she was very pleased that two of nine justices concurred with the store 's argument .
For the past couple weeks , Twitter has come under attacks that besieged it with more traffic than it could handle .
Now comes evidence that the microblogging website is being used to feed the very types of infected machines that took it out of commission .
That 's the conclusion of Jose Nazario , the manager of security research at Arbor Networks .
On Thursday , he stumbled upon a Twitter account that was being used as part of an improvised update server for computers that are part of a botnet .
The account , which Twitter promptly suspended , issued tweets containing a single line of text that looked indecipherable to the naked eye .
Using what 's known as a base64 decoder , however , the dispatches pointed to links where infected computers could receive malware updates .
Master command channels used to herd large numbers of infected machines have long been one of the weak links in the botnet trade .
Not only do they cost money to maintain , but they can provide tell - tale clues that help law enforcement agents to track down the miscreants running the rogue networks .
Bot herders have used ICQ , internet relay chat , and other chat mediums to get around this limitation , but this appears to be the first time Twitter is known to have been employed .
Nazario said he 's found at least two other Twitter accounts he suspects were being used in the same fashion , but needs to do additional analysis before he can be sure .
The bots using the Twitter account connected using RSS feeds , a technique that allowed them to receive each tweet in real time without the need of an account .
It was unclear how many bots connected to the account .
Up to now , the bot designers have done a good job keeping their enterprise under wraps .
The original bot software is detected by just 46 percent of the major anti-virus tools , according to this VirusTotal analysis .
The updates , which appear to be affiliated with the Buzus trojan , are even stealthier , with only 22 percent of AV engines detecting it .
" This continues the themes that we 've been seeing for years now , " Nazario told El Reg .
" Twitter is just a new mechanism for this , of once you 're on the bot pushing out new stuff that 's not detected , basically outrunning AV . "
Nazario , who offers more details here , says he discovered the Twitter command and control channel by accident , while looking for evidence into denial - of - service attacks that took it out of service for millions of users last week .
His finding suggests that in the world of internet crime , large sites can unwittingly be cast as both the victim and the enabler , perhaps simultaneously . ®
Flatulence , farce and pharaohs feature in the list of the world 's oldest jokes Breaking news about breaking wind : the world 's oldest joke is a one - liner about flatulence , researchers say .
Academics have compiled a list of the most ancient gags and the oldest , harking back to 1900BC , is a Sumerian proverb from what is now southern Iraq .
" Something which has never occurred since time immemorial ; a young woman did not fart in her husband 's lap , " goes the joke .
Randy pharaohs , thirsty ox - drivers and barbers also feature in the list .
The oldest British joke dates back to the 10th Century , and uses the traditional question and answer format to suggestively poke fun at Anglo - Saxon men .
" What hangs at a man 's thigh and wants to poke the hole that it 's often poked before ?
A key . "
Pharaohs and emperors HAVE YOUR SAY
The most humourous joke will come when you least expect it Nikk , South Shields " Jokes have varied over the years , with some taking the question and answer format while others are witty proverbs or riddles , " said Dr Paul McDonald , who led the study by academics at the University of Wolverhampton .
" What they all share , however , is a willingness to deal with taboos and a degree of rebellion . "
As today , world leaders make good foils for ancient humour , particularly Egyptian pharaohs , as shown by this 1600 BC joke : " How do you entertain a bored pharaoh ?
Sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile - and urge the pharaoh to go fishing . "
One Roman jape dating back to the 1st Century BC details the Emperor Augustus touring his realm and coming across a man who bears a striking resemblance to himself .
Intrigued , he asks the man : " Was your mother at one time in service at the palace ? "
The man replies : " No your highness , but my father was . "

Name , a novel
Toadex Hobogrammathon
137 Pages
Name is about as close as one can get to a " novel " that was written by a machine and for a machine : it seems especially primed to attract and repel spam - blockers with its pseudo - porn opening , and yet it also tosses a distracting bone to the bots with its stream of seemingly random verbiage after its first paragraphs .
But far as we can tell , Name is the exorbitant creation of a single human being who is known only by the name of " Toadex Hobogrammathon , " the same person who created the Jarry - esque , day - glo colored website Dagmars Chili Pitas , the only " poetry " blog that renders even the marginal trappings of the format itself — such as the date , tables , fonts , colors , etc. — fodder for its neo -Dada somersaults .
Surprisingly , Name turns out to be a good read , perhaps more along the line of Kenny Goldsmith 's barnstorming procedural projects or Peter Manson 's aggregation of junk phrases , Adjunct , than anything from Toni Morrison or Alan Davies , but nonetheless something to keep the retina fused to the screen , with a furious , decidedly No Wave soundtrack to boot .
This is the perfect novel to run your computer 's voice emulator on in the background while you while away precious life at the office .
Looks like Final Fantasy director Hironobu Sakaguchi and composer Nobuo Uematsu might disagree as to how Square Enix 's world - famous RPG got its name .
Last Friday , Wired.com photographer Jon Snyder was shooting Uematsu after our interview , and had him turn to me and engage in some small talk while he snapped pictures .
What to talk about ?
I remembered that a Game|Life reader had just emailed me asking if I knew , definitively , how the game got its name .
There are two different stories out there .
One is that Square was going bankrupt , and thought this would be their last game , hence " final fantasy . "
The other is that Sakaguchi was going to quit Square and go back to college , but make one final game before he left .
What I 'd said to that reader was that I believed that the story about Square going bankrupt sounded like baloney – after all , was n't making Famicom games in the eighties in Japan like a license to print money ?
But more than that , Sakaguchi himself had repeated the college story in many different interviews , and I could n't find any source for the bankruptcy story .
So I asked Uematsu .
Is it true , I asked , that the game is called Final Fantasy because Sakaguchi was going to go back to college and quit the game biz ?
Uematsu laughed :
It 's true that Sakaguchi was going to quit , he said , but the bigger reason , the real reason , was that Square was going to go bankrupt and the designers believed that it would be the company 's swan song .
So there we have it , from someone who was there when it all happened : the Square - was - going - bankrupt theory of the game 's unique moniker is , at least , supported by Uematsu , which takes it out of the " baseless rumor " category .
Now , someone just needs to ask Koichi Sugiyama about that rumor that Dragon Quest games can't be sold on school days in Japan ...
Many many people have asked , so I have modified the design to support the addition of Minute LEDs on my clock .
You are welcome to add them around the corners , or in a straight line if you like .
There is new firmware for the PIC micro - but the firmware does not mind if the LEDs are there or not - meaning that if you would like to have the minute LEDs you can add them , and if you do n't want them , you do n't have to have them .
Start by downloading the new firmware into your micro - you can find the HEX file for your micro attached to this page .
Then , we need to add the cabling for the LEDs onto the back of the controller board -
There are a few spare pins that are not really used that we can use for the minute LEDs .
LED1 - Pin17
LED2 - Pin18
LED3 - Pin10
LED4 - Pin33
Ground - Pin12
Simply connect some 5 conductor ribon cable to the pads shown above .
Drill some holes in the front of the clock for the LEDs in each corner and mount the LEDs using a small amount of hot melt glue .
Solder a 270 Ohm resistor to each cathode ( Short lead ) , and wire the ground lead from your 5 conductor cable to each resistor .
Finally , connect the LED leads to the anode of each LED , and tidy up your wiring .
When the clock is turned on – the self test will cycle through all of the LEDs to re-assure you that you have connected them correctly .
Simple as that -
You may mount your minute LEDs however you like .
the photos I have attached should be helpful !
Finally - Remember when you download the files - you will need to rename the file with the correct extension .c .h , and .hex depending on which file you downloaded .
You know you fucking love em .

Microsoft yesterday released a package of five Security Bulletins offering fixes for a total of eight vulnerabilities .
While it 's news worth celebrating , unfortunately the software company has also failed to address three other zero - day vulnerabilities .
Browse And Get Owned , Drive - By Attacks Addressed
All five of the Security Bulletins Microsoft has addressed were outlined in September and deemed " critical " -- the highest level of concern .
Three out of five of the issues taken care of by Microsoft fix issues associated with " browse - and - get - owned " attacks , otherwise known as " drive - by " attacks .
These problems occur when a user stumbles upon a legitimate looking ( but otherwise malicious ) website or program and find their systems infected .
Of the remaining issues addressed , two involve network problems that could lead to remote code execution .
Another , involving flaws in the Windows Media format , could also allow for remote code execution .
Three Zero-Day Exploits Unaddressed
As for the flaws remaining unaddressed , security experts appear very concerned that Microsoft has n't yet issued a patch for them .
Speaking to the media yesterday , Lusmension forensic and security analyst Paul Henry noted that each of the three zero - day vulnerabilities need to be addressed by Microsoft as soon as possible .
( Source : informationweek.com )
According to reports , Microsoft knows about the flaws -- most of which involve Internet Information Services ( IIS ) vulnerabilities -- but it's not yet known just how long they 've been aware of their presence .
For its part , Microsoft has claimed that those reporting the Internet Information Services vulnerabilities did not do so responsibly .
As for the issues that can be addressed right now with Microsoft 's latest patch , experts are suggesting users first install / apply MS09 - 048 , which addresses three vulnerabilities in Windows TCP / IP ( the Internet Protocol Suite ) .

When economic times are bad and people worry about the future , they become cautious about undertaking long - term projects .
There are few initiatives that have longer - term implications than having babies .
So the recent news that the number of births in our country dropped last year for the first time in a decade is not surprising .
This dip in childbearing is a classic human response to adverse economic conditions , one that often occurred even before the widespread use of modern contraceptive technology .
It was particularly marked during the Great Depression , but the upturn in fertility rates in subsequent years set the stage for the population we live in and many of the social and economic challenges we face .
During the Roaring ’ 20s , the U.S. population increased by 1.46 percent per year , rising from 106 million to 123 million .
But in the 1930s , growth fell by half , to 0.74 percent per year , with the total population rising to 132 million .
A bit of this decline in overall population growth was due to higher mortality , as some people were malnourished and many did not have funds for medical care .
But most of the decline was due to lower birth rates .
Early in the 1930s , the Census Bureau issued a report projecting that , at then - prevailing birth and death rates and average age of the population , the U.S. population would peak at 135 million in the 1940s and thereafter decline .
But after the United States joined World War II , growth rates rose above 1 percent even though some 14 million people were in uniform , most away from their homes and many overseas .
Once the war ended , and the nation experienced peacetime prosperity for the first time in 16 years , birth rates soared .
The population sailed right past the Census projection of 135 million and hit 150 million in 1950 , the year I was born .
It hit 200 million by 1968 and 300 million a few years ago .
Eighty - one million people were born from Jan. 1 , 1946 , through Dec. 31 , 1964 , the span usually defined as the Baby Boom .
The first official boomer qualified for Social Security retirement benefits on New Year ’s Day 2008 , and boomer retirements soon will become a torrent .
The challenges of large increases in the number of potential retirees relative to the working population will play a dominant role in economic policy for the next half - century , regardless of how we fund Social Security .
The difficult aspect of unraveling intertwined relationships between economic conditions and population growth is that of separating shorter - term cyclical fluctuations like depressed birth rates in the 1930s or 2008 from longer - term structural changes in fertility .
That long - term decline in the number of children per woman has been especially steep in wealthy industrialized countries but is also occurring in nearly all developing countries .
But given the much younger average age in poor countries and a higher proportion of women in or yet to reach child - bearing age , the population of poorer countries will grow markedly relative to the richer ones over the next half - century .
That will pose economic challenges in itself .

The bizarro rock legend got tangled up in blue in Long Branch , NJ , on July 23 when a homeowner called to report a weirdo hanging around her house .
When the “ Like a Rolling Stone ” crooner , who was looking for shelter from the storm , told cop Kristie Buble who he was , she thought he was pulling her leg .
“ I ’ve seen pictures of Bob Dylan from a long time ago and he did n’t look like Bob Dylan to me at all , ” the 24 - year - old Buble told ABC News .
“ He was wearing black sweatpants tucked into black rain boots , and two raincoats with the hood pulled down over his head . ”
Buble asked what the 68 - year - old rock legend was doing in town .
When Dylan said he was doing a show with John Mellancamp and Willie Nelson , she figured he might be a joker or a thief .
“ We see a lot of people on our beat , and I was n’t sure if he came from one of our hospitals or something , ” Buble said .
Even though a second officer joined Buble , he also did not recognize the singer , who was not carrying ID .
The officers then put Dylan in their patrol car and drove him back to the Ocean Place Resort and Spa , where he said he was staying .
“ He was really nice , though , and he said he understood why I had to verify his identity and why I could n’t let him go , ” Buble said .
“ I pulled into the parking lot , ” she said , “ and sure enough , there were these enormous tour buses , and I thought , ‘ Whoa . ’
“ We go over to the tour bus and knock on the door and some guy answers and I say , ‘ Are you missing someone ? ’ ” Buble said .
Eventually , tour staffers showed Dylan ’s passport and a red - faced Buble thanked him for his cooperation .
“ Um , have a nice day , ” she said .
Long Branch business administrator Howard Woolley said that given the officer ’s youth , it was understandable why she may not have known the counter - culture figure .
“ I do n’t think she was familiar with his entire body of work , ” Woolley said .

Something I ’m about to tell is you not true .
Read the next paragraph , look at the next two photos and try to figure it out .
I rescued a dear little squirrel this week .
AJ found him , separated from his mother , emaciated and inches from death .
Although we were working , I scooped the little baby up and fed him some half & half .
Once he got a few drops of liquid in and got warmed up ( he was cold to the touch ) , he began to move around and look for a place to hide .
I brought him home , and inside ( despite AJ ’s directive that he remain outdoors ) .
He was so cute and helpless that I could n’t imagine letting him fall prey to cats or fire ants .
Is n’t he adorable ?
Although I did n’t give him an official name I did call him “ Little Sweetie ” .
He stayed with us for two days , as I arranged placement with a person who does small animal rescue and rehabilitation .
Although I would have loved to raise this cute little squirrel and release him in our yard , I knew this was impossible with my schedule , and the fact that we live in an RV .
Not to mention that the cats would make short work of a tame squirrel .
He is quite smart and quickly learned the routine .
I taught him to drink baby formula from a dish .
Although he was very shy and preferred to stay tucked away in his washcloth nest , he would wax brave and assertive when it was time to eat .
When rousted , he would run around in my hands , sniffing and nuzzling in an attempt to nurse .
Once I got him used to drinking from the dish , he would go straight to it and excitedly lap up the formula .
As soon as he was finished , he would try to snuggle up in my hand or his washcloth , where he would begin bathing himself until he was all clean .
How adorable it was to watch him rub his tiny little paws over his face , pushing his ears forward and fluffing up his fur .
Next , I had to help him go to the bathroom with a damp piece of tissue .
He was still so young that he had n’t learned to go on his own , yet .
What a way to start a life !
After this routine he always went to sleep .
Many times I watched him doze off in my palm as I marveled at how tiny , soft and delicate he was .
OK , I hope you do n’t hate me for the fib I have told you .
Just like “ Little Sweetie ” washed up after every meal , it ’s time for me to come clean .
AJ did discover this baby rodent on the brink of starvation .
I did rescue the helpless creature and nurse it back to health .
And the description is accurate , except for one detail :
Little Sweetie has a secret …
He ’s a baby rat !
Does the fact that he has a bald tail make him any less endearing ?
I do n’t think so .
After all , a squirrel is just a bushy tailed rat with good PR .
When AJ told me he had found a “ mouse ” trapped in a bus tub in the stock room of one of our accounts I knew that I would be the one to rescue it .
I truly expected to find a healthy mouse and release it out by the dumpster .
Although I worked in pest control , and am responsible for putting contracts on the lives of many rodents , I still do n’t have the heart to take their lives .
My philosophy is to make your place impenetrable to creatures and deny them the opportunity to enter .
AJ ’s philosophy is “ It ’s a frickin rat ! ” , only he did n’t use the nice version of the word .
He has since vowed to stop bringing creatures to my attention .
This is one promise I hope he breaks .
When I found this little guy stretched out in the bottom of a bus tub I knew there was no way I could sentence him to death .
He must have been trapped for days and seemed to have given up all hope of escaping .
He put up no resistance when I picked him up and actually looked at me with such pathetic eyes that I had no choice but to help him .
Although he was the size of a mouse , I knew that he was actually a baby rat .
I ’m fairly certain that he is a Roof Rat ( Rattus rattus ) , also know as Tree Rat , Ship Rat , Brown Rat or Black Rat .
The sleek agile Roof Rats and their chunky , slower cousins the Norway Rats are both commensal rodents ; meaning that they have evolved to live alongside humans .
Although they can carry disease , smell bad and can be quite destructive , I ca n’t help but admire them for their intelligence and ingenuity .
Lab rats or “ Fancy Rats ” ( bred as pets ) are actually the same species as the Norway Rats which cause such a nuisance when they make their way into your home uninvited .
But rats also serve a valuable purpose to the human race .
Think of the millions of lives saved by these creatures and their service in medical testing .
It ’s all a matter of perspective .
Roof Rats are quite capable of surviving in nature , and since they are well established and are not going away any time soon , I plan to release Little Sweetie once he is big enough to live on his own .
Perhaps he will make it , perhaps he wo n’t , but at least I can sleep easy knowing that he did n’t die a long and miserable death trapped in a plastic tub .
“ Little Sweetie ” washing up .
For now , he is staying with Jessica at Angel Rats Rescue in Palm Bay .
I was fortunate to find her nearby and willing to take responsibility for him until he grows up .
Jessica Botts ( founder of Angel Rats Rescue ) is devoted to rescuing rats and other creatures .
She provides them with clean , ample accommodations where they get plenty of socialization and handling .
I am certain that my tiny friend is in good hands and look forward to the day when I can pick him up and release him with more of his own kind .
Do n’t worry … I wo n’t let him go near your house : )
Follow Up :
I have been in contact with Jessica , and she has decided to keep him as a permanent resident .
She has named him “ Jack ” .
I ’ve since heard some good news that roof rats can make very fine pets .
I look forward to watching his progress .

September 13 , 2009 – As Maryland weighs legalizing medical marijuana , it should consider my experience when I visited the student lounge at Montgomery College ’s Rockville campus at lunchtime last week and began interviewing randomly selected students about their views on weed .
Among the first group I approached , one of the four young men volunteered within minutes that he not only smoked marijuana but also sold it .
He told me his price list : $ 10 a gram for “ middies , ” the least potent and most readily available variety ; $ 20 a gram for “ headies ” with more THC ; $ 35 for the strongest , “ exotic ” types , like “ white widow . ”
The youth ’s matter - of - fact attitude highlights a reality that ’s under our nose but is often overlooked in the oh - so - earnest debates over drug policy .
When it comes to marijuana , American society has lost the war on drugs–and that ’s okay .
We should stop squandering time and money trying to reverse history and instead legalize both medical and recreational use of this mild narcotic widely seen as no more harmful than alcohol .
Here are some facts :
Pot is widely available .
A sizable chunk of the population thinks that ’s not a problem .
In many locales , including Montgomery , prosecutors routinely send offenders caught with small quantities to a few days or weeks of drug education rather than prison .
California and 12 other states will let you buy marijuana for health reasons , such as to control vomiting or relieve glaucoma .
Four of those states permit collectives in which members grow their own .
In our region , advocates in Maryland and the District are pushing to legalize medical cannabis .
( Virginia is sitting it out for now . )
Maryland ’s policy recently attracted attention when a little - noticed 2003 law , which sets a maximum fine of $ 100 for medical use , was applied in two separate cases Aug. 27 in Rockville .
Otherwise the penalty for pot possession in Maryland is up to one year in prison and a $ 1,000 fine .
My campus interviews indicate that the younger generation overwhelmingly favors legalizing cannabis .
Fifteen of 20 students said they supported it , and the opponents acknowledged that they were in a small minority .
This , mind you , is the generation raised since the onset of well - financed , high - profile , anti-drug education campaigns , such as DARE .
Students offered numerous thoughtful reasons for legalization .
The most frequent , by far , was the common - sense point that current laws are n’t working .
“ For most people my age , it ’s a popular thing .
People are going to do it anyway , ” said Simone Brewer , 17 , a freshman from Rockville .
Several also argued that the economy would benefit .
The government should tax marijuana and save the money now spent on prosecuting and imprisoning users , they said .
“ People are doing it every day , but the government is n’t making money off of it , ” said Billy Vivian , 19 , of Wheaton , who is studying criminal justice .
“ The prisons would n’t be so filled up with nonviolent offenders . ”
All the students who supported legalization also favored keeping laws against such stronger drugs as cocaine , ecstasy , heroin and methamphetamines .
They said those can cause severe mental and health problems or even kill you .
They said legal marijuana should be subject to restrictions similar to those on alcohol , with strict prohibitions against underage use and driving while high .
Many of the students said they thought alcohol is more harmful than pot .
It is more dangerous to drive drunk than stoned , they thought , and pot makes people mellow while alcohol makes them belligerent .
“ When ’s the last time you heard about some guy on marijuana coming in and hitting his wife ? ” Anthony Thompson , 18 , of Silver Spring , said .
In my view , there ’s one strong reason for keeping marijuana illegal .
The risk of getting caught discourages some people from trying it or using it regularly .
That ’s a plus for public health .
But that ’s outweighed by the social and economic benefits of legalization .
Moreover , the current policy leads people to be cynical about the law .
“ If you have laws that are not effectively enforced , or are flouted as openly as some of these are , I think it undermines public confidence , ” said a senior Maryland law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to be candid about a controversial subject .
Some of the young people who support legalization now will doubtless change their minds as they get older , especially when they start to worry that their own children will smoke as they — or their friends — did .
Given the other trends , though , there ’s a good chance that the rising generation will change the laws when it comes to power .
We should change them now .
It would save millions of dollars and countless hours of police officers ’ time and eliminate a source of hypocrisy about what we as a society actually tolerate .

YOU can call your kid Metallica , Fully Hektik Sik or God Bless , but do n't even think about giving him the name Ned Kelly - that would be offensive .
Christian names deemed acceptable and unacceptable by the NSW Registry of Births , Deaths and Marriages provide interesting reading .
The Registry can reject a name for a number of reasons under the Registration Act 1995 .
Reasons include that the name might be obscene or offensive , is too long or includes ``symbols without phonetic significance . ''
The Act also bans official titles , ranks or names ``contrary to the public interest for some other reason . ''
Nor can names be a sentence .
Ned Kelly was rejected for public interest reasons , as was Jesus Christ .
Post Master General and Chief Maximus were rejected because they are titles .
Other names knocked back included a blank space , the child 's Medicare number and the number seven , a name suggested in the sitcom Seinfeld .
Titles including Prince , Princess , Dame , Duke , King , Queens and Lady have all been rejected , but Prince , Queen , Lady and Sir are eligible used on their own .
For reasons known only to the Registrar , Metallica , Fully Hektik Sik and God Bless are acceptable .
For privacy reasons , the Attorney General 's office , which oversees the Registry , could not reveal Metallica 's identity .
Fully Hektik
Sik 's surname also remains unidentified to all except his / her family and friends .
Attorney General John Hatzistergos urged parents to use common sense when choosing a name for their child .
" A person 's name is their signature for life , their identity , '' he said .
``A person 's reputation will forever be linked to it and I would remind parents of this special significance when choosing a name for their child . ''
Sweden recently ruled Metallica an acceptable name , along with Budweiser .
France and Denmark give citizens a list of names to choose from .
In 1980 , prior to the Registry being tightened up in 1995 , an Australian couple successfully registered their child with the name Monkey .
No shame in asking for help ( Image : Ken Conley / Willow Garage )
ASKING someone for help is second nature for humans , and now it could help robots overcome one of the thorniest problems in artificial intelligence .
That ’s the thinking behind a project at Willow Garage , a robotics company in Palo Alto , California .
Researchers there are training a robot to ask humans to identify objects it does n’t recognise .
If successful , it could be an important step in developing machines capable of operating with consistent autonomy .
Object recognition has long troubled AI researchers .
While computers can be taught to recognise simple objects , such as …
Booking mug shot of Bernard Madoff released to Reuters on March 17 , 2009 .
REUTERS / UNITED STATES MARSHALS SERVICE /FOIA / Handout
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Bernard Madoff ’s whistle - blower and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ’s top enforcer will testify before Congress this week on how the SEC failed to uncover Madoff ’s $ 65 billion fraud , a congressional panel said on Monday .
Harry Markopolos , a fraud examiner who tried to warn regulators that Madoff ’s business was a fraud , and the SEC ’s Director of Enforcement Robert Khuzami are expected to testify at the Senate Banking committee ’s hearing on Thursday .
The hearing comes after last week ’s damning report from the SEC ’s inspector general who accused agency staff of missing numerous opportunities to uncover Madoff ’s scam .
SEC Inspector General David Kotz and the agency ’s acting director of compliance , inspections and examinations , John Walsh , are also expected to testify , the Senate Banking Committee said on Monday .
The people who build and run the hardware we send into space probably experience a lot of sleepless nights .
It 's possible to design multiple redundant systems and test everything on the ground , but that 's no guarantee that things will operate as you expect them to once they get sent into space ( witness the originally distorted optics of the Hubble ) .
For the people running the Kepler observatory , which is designed to detect planets that have orbits and sizes which approximate Earth 's , it 's apparently time to breathe easily .
Scientists have now calibrated its camera against a known planet , and found that its sensitivity is up to its intended task .
The Kepler was launched in early March and went operational in the middle of May , so these results have come very quickly .
That 's partly the result of the planet it has observed , HAT - P - 7 b .
The planet is what 's called a " hot Jupiter " that orbits close to its host star , and completes one orbit ( a HAT year ? ) in a brisk 2.2 days .
As a result , the folks running Kepler were able to observe multiple orbits in just 10 days of work that took place during the commissioning period .
The results are published in today 's issue of Science , and NASA has hosted a press conference to describe them .
Finding a planet we know is there is n't much of a breakthrough , but the data obtained provided an important test of both the Kepler hardware and the data processing pipeline , as well over 50,000 stars were imaged during this testing .
After extracting the data from the host star , HAT - P - 7 , the authors tested various models to explain the data .
The best fit was to a model for a planet that partly occludes its host star , and then is entirely occluded by the star as it orbits behind it from the perspective of our solar system .
The real test of Kepler comes from the precision of this fit .
By combining the data from multiple orbits , he authors calculated an orbital period of 2.204802 days , ?0.000063 — that 's give or take five seconds .
Zooming in on the HAT - P - 7 data obtained by Kepler .
But what 's really striking is how clean the data is .
A couple of slides were shown at the press conference , which are combined here .
The top shows what the light from HAT - P - 7 looks like from Earth - based telescopes , with the dip occurring as the planet passes in front of the star .
In contrast , the variability in the measurements from Kepler , shown immediately below , is impossible to detect at this resolution .
Some noise becomes apparent when you zoom in by a factor of 7 but , more importantly , a small , secondary dip is also apparent on the right of the graph .
Zooming in further , that dip becomes more apparent , and it 's clear that it 's surrounded by a slight rise .
This is the product of HAT - P - 7b sliding behind the star .
Since the planet is very hot , radiation from it combines with reflections of the light from the host star as the planet 's orbit brings it close to the star from our perspective , explaining the increase in light .
Once it goes behind the star , however , you get the drop , caused by the star obscuring HAT - P - 7b entirely .
It 's the size of the dip that 's important here .
It 's on the order of 122 parts - per-million in the total signal .
We 'll need to get down to about 84 ppm to spot an Earth - like planet , and the data show that Kepler is up to the task .
As this data was being processed , Kepler had already gotten down to work , staring down a star - rich arm of our Milky Way galaxy , looking for variations in the light of 100,000 of these stars that would indicate the presence of planets .
As time goes on , it should be able to detect multiple transits of planets that take longer and longer to orbit , which means planets that are further and further out .
As the hosts of the press conference put it , check back in 2011 if you want to know about more Earth - like planets .
NASA has placed animations from the press conference on the Kepler site .

Blackest Night has been roaring through the minds of comic book fans this week .
Yesterday Blackest Night # 2 , Blackest Night : Batman # 1 and Green Lantern Corps # 39 hit store shelves .
Additionally IGN was able to
But we 're not done yet .
Today we 're able to exclusively bring you the cover to Blackest Night # 5 .
That cover just so happens to pull back the curtain on the big player responsible for the Black Lantern Corps .
Still wanting spoilers ?
Fair enough .
The Blackest Night # 5 cover reveals the big bad guy is , as some had speculated , Nekron , a relatively obscure Green Lantern villain that debuted in 1981 in the pages of Tales of the Green Lantern Corps # 2 .
Many of you are likely scratching your heads at this point .
That 's okay , so were we .
To provide a little more perspective on this powerful entity , and to give some context to his role in Blackest Night , we contacted the one and only Geoff Johns .
The Blackest Night writer chatted exclusively with IGN about Nekron and gave us some great clues for the future of the series .
Obviously Johns wants readers to discover the biggest secrets within the event itself , but there are several really interesting clues in the following interview .
And stay tuned to IGN for more Blackest Night coverage .
Tomorrow we 'll debut pages from Blackest Night : Superman # 1 and have a second interview with Johns about Blackest Night # 2 .
Blackest Night # 5 Cover " Who is Nekron ? "
He 's the reason the Guardians swore to protect the universe .
You 'll more about that later .
So many people have been asking who is behind this – long time readers are like , " Is it Nekron ? ! "
And I 've been close - mouthed , not for any other reason than I wanted the first issue to be out and I wanted people to see how kick ass he looks now thanks to Ivan Reis and Joe Prado before saying , " Yes , we 'll be using Nekron ! "
So revealing him on this cover and spurring people to start searching the Internet and their comic shops for everything about Nekron is a lot of fun .
For me it honestly was never a question .
If I was going to do a Green Lantern storyline about the dead rising , the character I was going to use was going to be Nekron .
He 's pretty obscure , but like Black Hand , Sinestro and Hector Hammond – you know , these characters that had been a little under the radar for years or even decades – he 's someone I wanted to pull out and reimagine and rebuild .
And again as you 're seeing , Ivan has done an incredible job , along with Joe Prado , on redesigning the character .
All you need to know about Nekron is that he is one of the most powerful dark forces in the universe … if not the most powerful .
He is the darkness .
He 's someone I 've wanted to explore for a while .
But you 'll learn more and more about him as the series goes on .
It 'll all become clear as you read more … but he 's not really a villain .
Nekron is existence .
Yeah , he 's very different .
That 's his own personal battery .
He 's not that big .
–laughs -
The cover is more symbolic than anything .
He 's big , but not 100 feet tall .
That 's all about who he is , where he 's from and his existence .
Again , he 's the reason the Guardians had to protect the universe – he's the first evil that they ever attempted to imprison .
Yeah , Nekron 's the big boy .
There are a lot more surprises coming up though throughout this story .
Oh , could be …No problem !
A Sydney man who produced a do - it - yourself terrorism book has been sentenced to at least nine years in jail .
Last year a Supreme Court jury found 39 - year - old Belal Khazaal guilty of producing a book , knowing that it was connected with assisting a terrorist attack .
The court heard that he compiled historical and religious writings about how to shoot down planes , strike motorcades and assassinate high - ranking government officials in Australia , the United States and other countries .
The book was called ' Provisions on the Laws of Jihad , ' it was written in Arabic and was posted on the internet .
Khazaal 's lawyer argued that he did not check all the material he compiled from other writers .
But the judge said it ' beggars belief ' that a person of average intelligence would not register the nature of the material .
Today in the Supreme Court , Khazaal was sentenced to 12 years in jail with a non parole period of nine years .
After he was sentenced , his supporters shouted abuse at the Bar table in Arabic .
Outside court , they said he has been unfairly treated because he is a Muslim .
Khazaal 's lawyer says there will be an appeal .
MSI ha appena annunciato una nuova serie di schede video , la Lightning , presentando la MSI N275GTX Lightning .
Raffreddata con il brevettato sistema di dissipazione Twin Frozr II , include punti di rilevamento delle tensioni e software Lightning Afterburner .
Scopriamola insieme .
MSI annuncia ufficialmente la nuova serie di schede grafiche Lightning graphic presentando la N275GTX Lightning .
Equipaggiata col nuovo sistema di raffreddamento Twin Frozr II ( basato sulla esclusiva tecnologia MSI SuperPipe ) la N275GTX Lightning è dotata di un sistema di raffreddamento annunciato come innovativo .
La VGA è stata dotata di un layout unico , basato su componenti di elevata qualità , dotato di 10 fasi PWM e della tecnologia APS : tutto questo per dare la massima stabilità e durata .
E non è finita qui , la N275GTX Lightning è dotata dei “ V - Check Points ” ossia dei punti di rilevamento per i voltaggi di GPU e memorie .
Per completare la sua incredibile dotazione è stato sviluppato un software dedicato , il Lightning Afterburner per gestire da Windows le frequenze , i voltaggi e la velocità delle ventole .
MSI ha fatto tutto questo per rendere la N275GTX
Lightning una scheda unica nel suo genere che alle sue frequenze di fabbrica è già più veloce di una GeForce GTX 285 reference .
La scheda N275GTX
Lightning è caratterizzata da bassi livelli di rumorosità e da ottime temperature di esercizio sotto massimo sforzo , ossia mentre si utilizzano programmi 3D e giochi .
Le 2 grandi ventole da 8 cm di diametro vengono regolate automaticamente in base alle temperature di GPU e memorie .
Se confrontato coi normali sistemi di raffreddamento , il Twin Frozr II è dotato di ben 5 heatpipe da 8 mm risultando fino al 90 % più efficiente !
Durante l’evento organizzato da MSI , il Master Overclocking Arena , alcuni overclocker hanno suggerito di migliorare il sistema di monitoraggio dei voltaggi della scheda .
MSI ha deciso così di inserire nel layout i due gruppi di V - Check Points , ossia dei punti di contatto che rendono il rilevamento dei voltaggi dei GPU e memorie comodo e veloce .
Sempre relativamente al potenziamento e al modding di questa VGA , Lightning Afterburner è un software di overclock che permette di regolare le frequenze e i voltaggi di GPU e delle memorie , e la velocità delle ventole direttamente da Windows rendendo l’overclock della N275GTX Lightning pratico e veloce .
Per la massima stabilità e una durata senza eguali , l’MSI N275GTX Lightning è equipaggiata con la nuova generazione di condensatori solidi : gli Hi-C Caps , ossia condensatori solidi ad alta capacità .
Questi componenti sono concepiti per lavorare ad alti voltaggi e per resistere a temperature che altri componenti non potrebbero sopportare .
MSI N275GTX Lightning possiede i componenti più avanzati .
Quando attraversati da corrente questi componenti minimizzano i disturbi generati dalle elevate frequenze di lavoro .
Un SSC è capace di prestazioni il 30 % superiori rispetto le normali induttanze permettendo di mantenere una stabilità eccezionale sotto overclock .
MSI N275GTX
Lightning è dotata di ben 10 fasi d’alimentazione , 8 per la GPU e 2 per le memorie , che permettono di raggungere livelli di stabilità incredibili .
Con questa scheda sarà possibile raggiungere frequenze elevatissime , secondo MSI .
La tecnologia APS regola automaticamente il numero delle fasi di alimentazioni di cui la GPU ha bisogno , in base al livello di carico a cui è sottoposta .
Questo sistema è stato implementato in quanto sotto carichi non elevati l’effecienza è maggiore con meno fasi attive .
L’APS agisce a livello di BIOS ed è quindi indipendente dal sistema operativo , questo rende l’APS un sistema del tutto unico nel suo genere non comparabile a nessun ’altra soluzione .
Caratteristiche salienti dell ’MSI N275GTX Lightning :
GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 275
Clock GPU : 700MHz
Clock Memorie : 2300MHz
Memoria : 1792 MB GDDR3 ( 0.8ns )
Componenti di Classe Militare ( Hi- c CAP / SSC / Solid CAP )
PWM a 10 fasi per la massima stabilità e durata , anche in overclock .
APS ( Active Phase Switching ) Regolazione automatica delle fasi per un’efficienza fino al 93 % superiore
Sistema di raffreddmaneto Twin Frozr II ( che rende la scheda più fredda di 23° rispetto ad una con design reference )
Tecnologia SuperPipe da 8 mm di diametro per un ’efficienza di raffreddamento fino al 90 % superiore .
V - Check Points per un pratico rilevamento dei voltaggi di GPU e memorie
Software Lightning Afterburner per l’overclock

You Had Me At Jell - O
AN INSIGHTFUL , IRREVERENT INTERVIEW WITH THE DIRECTING TEAM BEHIND CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS .
Chris Miller and Phil Lord certainly landed a dream gig that many animators would kill for .
Only a few years out of Dartmouth College , where they made individual animated films in a studio together , they got the chance to direct the animated adaptation of their favorite kids book of all - time , Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs .
It took them a few years , but they have created a well - received film adaptation of a cherished children ’s book that many feels captures the spirit of the original — a town called Swallow Falls becomes blanketed by flurries of food that are at first welcomed , but later become burdensome — while adding a backstory to include a young inventor ( named Flint Lockwood ) who generates the food storms , the weather woman ( Sam Sparks ) who breaks the story and the townspeople who learn about how moderation is a good thing .
And , of course , there ’s romance between two characters chasing their dreams and trying to prove to the world that they can make it .
Ultimately the 3D extravaganza that is Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs is a clever and well scripted animated adventure that provides a message with its gastronomic goofiness .
ADD caught up with the directors at a junket in New York that was held , ironically enough , at Dylan ’s Candy Bar , a lavish emporium of confectionary delights .
The two men , who look ten years younger than they are , have a wonderful comedic chemistry and play well off of one another .
So well , in fact , that later during tape playback , distinguishing between the two amid their quick banter often proved to be a challenge .
How are you ?
Chris Miller : I ’m awesome , how are you ?
Phil Lord : Did you fill your jar with candy ?
I did .
I got some gummy tarantulas .
But not the bacon gum .
That ’s just wrong .
Chris Miller : I ’ve yet to have something with bacon in it that was n’t delicious .
I ’m impressed and psyched that you think we held back .
That ’s good .
We were worried that there be too much hot dog in your face .
We knew this movie was going to be in 3D maybe two and half years out , and we also knew that there would be three or four big 3D movies coming out before ours .
We had a feeling that some of the real , ridiculous gagginess would be played a little bit – maybe it would or maybe it would n’t , we were n’t quite sure – but we wanted to play a little bit on the safe side .
The good thing about the new version of 3D is that it immerses you in the story and supports the movie in this great way — and do n’t get me wrong , we did a few ridiculous , in - your - face gags — but sometimes those take you out of the story .
And you want to feel immersed and brought into it rather than be pushed back out .
You could put that on the DVD , the “ 3D Overdrive ” version .
Phil Lord : Yes , exactly .
Chris Miller :
You know , there is some food in your face stuff there , too .
Just enough to keep you entertained .
These movies go through a lot of iterations .
They are born , they die and they are born again .
We came on about six years ago writing a version of the script , and we were invited to direct it in February of 2003 .
Why did they not fire us ?
That ’s kind of what you ’re asking .
I do n’t know .
That ’s a mystery to me .
We should have been fired multiple times throughout the project .
Sony had great faith in us and showed a lot of confidence and gave us a lot of support all the way through this project .
Did you come up with the idea of the machine in the sky ?
Chris Miller : Yes .
We had come in on a meeting for a different project at Sony and found out they had the rights to this book , which was our favorite kids book growing up .
We basically grabbed them by the lapels and forced them to let us make this movie because we loved it so much .
They called us a couple of days later and said , “ Hey , do you have any ideas for that other movie ? ”
We said , “ No , but we have lots of ideas for Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs . ”
“ Really ?
Can you come in and pitch us tomorrow ? ”
We actually did n’t have any ideas , so we said , “ Maybe the day after tomorrow ? ”
So we hung up the phone and basically came up with the plot we have now – the inventor , the machine and the backstory of Swallow Falls .
Phil Lord :
We approached it as if this story was a Jerry Bruckheimer movie , and how would a big Hollywood studio approach this thing ?
Let ’s just own that .
We wanted to make as brawny and crazy and as big a summer movie as possible .
If you ’re going to follow the disaster movie paradigm , they always have a scientist and always have a reporter in the cockpit , stuff like that , so we tried to do silly versions of all those archetypes .
Earthquake .
By far .
It sets up a lot of stories that do n’t actually pay off , which is hilarious .
It ’s a good enough movie that you can watch it all the way through , but bad enough that you ’re laughing all the time .
Richard Roundtree plays a motorcycle stuntmen and has a story arc that gets set up that was clearly cut out of the movie .
At the end , he just disappears .
“ Oh wow , he ’s a motorcycle stuntman !
I ’ll bet he ’s going to do a big motorcycle stunt ! ”
But no , he does n’t .
You two have a great chemistry together .
How did your lives intertwine ?
Phil Lord :
We were friends at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire .
We had an animation professor there , and I tricked Chris into quitting an important government class there , because he was a government major , to take this animation course .
We got really into it .
We shared a studio our senior year and made these incredibly long student films .
We had an animation professor there , David Ehrlich , who comes from the Japan animation world , and he turned us onto this do - it - yourself approach to filmmaking .
That ’s what great about animation – it ’s the one form of filmmaking that you can do with one person .
Chris Miller :
We did this movie with 500 people , so it was the opposite .
It ’s been a long process from working on our own to working together to working on a sitcom [ How I Met Your Mother ] with several dozen people to working on this movie with 500 amazing , talented artists and filmmakers all collaborating together to make something awesome .
[ After school ] we moved to L.A. at the same time and —
Phil Lord : Shared a bedroom that side by - by - side Bert and Ernie beds .
Chris Miller :
It was a little too much time together at that time .
Phil Lord :
We carpooled to work .
It was sad .
[ Our story began when ]
Chris got this call when were seniors in college from the Walt Disney Company , and basically there was an article about Chris in one of the alumni magazines that they send out to get donations .
It turned out that Michael Eisner ’s some Eric was Dartmouth ‘ 95 , but we never knew him .
The story was told to us that Eisner apparently gets this thing handed to him about this young animation guy Chris Miller , and he hands it to someone who hands it to someone who hands it to someone , and by the time it gets down the line , it goes from being like “ Hey , check these guys out ” to “ These are Eisner ’s boys !
Bring them to Los Angeles !
Give them a job .
I do n’t care what they look like . ”
And then Chris made the biggest mistake of his life [ by saying ] , “ Can I bring along my friend ? ”
Chris Miller :
They assumed that we were a team , and we actually had never worked together before .
“ I guess we ’re a team now . ”
And we have been ever since .
It would be way more convenient if one of us did one part and the other did the other part , but we work in the least efficient way possible , which is that we both try to do everything , so it sometimes is a very long process .
There ’s an art to our working relationship .
We started out as completely individual filmmakers who were asking each other advice , and now we ’re in this position where we ’re collaborating constantly .
That has been a little like a marriage .
You have to figure out how to compromise constantly and not be annoyed with the other person .
And we ’re almost there .
You obviously had to do a lot of research on food .
Which food was the most challenging to recreate on the screen ?
Phil Lord : Broccoli .
You might notice that it ’s not in the film .
Chris Miller :
It ’s very hard to render convincingly the little leaves of the mini- tree on broccoli .
Phil Lord :
The Imageworks guys really can do everything , but it ’s just a matter of what you ’re putting your focus on .
Because broccoli was n’t a huge factor in the movie we decided to cut that and other things .
For the three shots they were in the background it was n’t really worth it .
Chris Miller : Cheeseburgers were actually very difficult because when they fell they had to break apart convincingly , not [ bounce ] like a rubber toy .
That meant that they had to model each piece separately .
Lettuce had to have the characteristics and sloppiness of lettuce , the beef had to have the glistening , shininess of meat and the buns had to squish a little bit .
That was a big challenge .
Also , the spaghetti tornado was a huge project , trying to get it to look like spaghetti and also awesome .
With Mr. T , we thought about it [ doing the Mohawk ] , but it ’s not really a joke .
“ Look , it ’s Mr. T , remember he had the big mohawk ? ” [ At one point ] we wanted to further than that , so we gave him a reverse mohawk [ from side to side ] .
He went through a bunch of different iterations to one point where he just had a regular hair cut , and there was some action scene where it got buzzed .
It was too much of an actual pop culture reference that we were trying to avoid .
We ’re such nerds .
There many times when we were pitching things , and we were tempted to have him say , “ I pity the food .
” There was another one that people implored us to do : “ You had me at Jell - O . ” As for James Caan ’s character , our inspiration for the character design came from the original book and a series of books – This is London , This Is Paris , This Is New York – from an artist called Miroslav Sasek , classic animation and the Muppets .
One of the things about Muppets is that they exist in three dimensions .
They ’re really appealing , have a really simple design and are able to be really expressive without having eyes that move .
The character [ of Tim ] was not supposed to be emotionally expressive .
We thought it was the perfect choice for a character where his eyes are windows to the soul , and he ’s reserved , so you ca n’t see that .
But you get a glimpse of them every now and then .
We had to fight tooth and nail to get that through the gauntlet because studios want you to make appealing characters that you can put on T - shirts and market , and he does n’t look cute or friendly or nice .
So the compromise was that underneath those eyebrows you get to see them eventually , and it wound up being a great bit for the movie .
Check out the interview with Cloudy … co-star Anna Faris .
This week I revisited a distribution I first wrote about back in 2007 , Pardus Linux .
It ’s developed by the Turkish National Research Institute of Electronics and Cryptography , it has its own package management system called PISI ( Packages Installed Successfully , as Intended ) , and it ’s not based on any other Linux distribution , which makes quite a change these days .
I was eager to see how it had developed since our last encounter .
Vital Stats :
Distro Base – Unique ( It ’s a custom Linux distro )
Packaging – .pisi ( Managed by the PISI utility )
Linux Kernel – 2.6.30.4-125
Default Desktop – KDE 4.2.4
Installation :
I downloaded the International installer CD and not the LiveCD , having made a mistake with that last time I tried Pardus .
Things may have changed by now but at the time I downloaded the LiveCD only to discover you could n’t install from it , it really was just a LiveCD .
Booting up the CD I was greeted with a funky looking menu , not the most technical description I know but the design is very slick .
You ’re quickly prompted to accept the GNU GPL first up .
Not all distros ask you to do that but I think it ’s a good thing .
Most new users will just accept without even reading a line , we ’ve all become conditioned to do that over the years by 50 page license agreements .
But if one person takes the time to read a little bit and actually learn what the GPL is , I think that ’s positive .
The next step is to check the integrity of the installer CD , something I do n’t often bother to do but I probably should .
This took about 5 mins scanning the disc and checking , after that you can begin the install proper .
There ’s a series of screens asking you all the usual questions : keyboard layout , time zone , user details , root password and more .
Then it ’s time to sort out your hard drive partitions which is always a key facet of any install .
The GUI looks nice but I must confess I found it a little confusing at first in manual partitioning .
You click on a partition and set it up but if you then click onto the next partition without first pressing apply , all your selections are lost .
It took me a minute to work this out and it seems a bit counter intuitive from a HCI point of view .
Nevertheless I got to grips with it and I like the way it gives you sensible descriptive labels in the options .
Instead of saying / or root for your system drive you choose “ Pardus system files ” , which might be a bit more obvious to some new users .
Plain English is always a winner for me .
I chose to make my root … sorry “ Pardus system files ” partition 12gb as I normally do and formatted it as ext4 , the default option .
I had to manually choose my swap partition and set it up though , this is often detected by other distributions , even under manual partitioning .
I laid out the partitions as I usually do on this machine ( Dell XPS m1330n ) :
12gb / ( root ) – formatted as ext4 in this case
4gb swap
140gb / home – formatted as ext3
Note :
If you ’re looking at the slide show and wondering why the partitioning shots do n’t look right , it ’s because I used a VirtualBox install later to get screenshots of the installer .
With my partitions in order I was only left to chose where I wanted GRUB installed and check over the details I ’d entered .
I then started the installer on its way and sat back to see how long it would take .
It actually presents you with a nice looking and informative slide show about Pardus 2009 .
I watched it for about 5 minutes until it looped back to the first slide again , but it did make a nice distraction .
All in all the installation took about 25 mins , not the quickest I ’ve ever done but still fairly respectable .
The YALI installer itself feels very polished and certainly looks good .
Apart from a few minor UI gripes I ’d say it ’s up there with the best of them .
The sarcastic name “ Yet Another Linux Installer ” appeals to my sense of humour too .
FULL INSTALLATION SLIDE SHOW 43 PICS
Configuring the system :
This release of Pardus comes with KDE 4.2.4 on the desktop and it ’s no secret that I ’m a Gnome fan , but I ’m also an open minded guy and I figured I ’d give it my best shot .
The first thing you notice on logging into your new system is a tool called Kaptan ( Turkish for captain apparently ) , which aims to help you through the process of personalizing things .
It used to be called Kaptan Desktop and I remember joking in previous reviews that he must be some sort of super hero , in fact he looks more like Captain Birdseye for anyone who gets that reference .
It might be a UK thing .
Looks aside he does his job very well , taking you through a series of screens where you can choose a theme , a menu style , add Internet connection settings and many other things .
I found it very cool to be able to make the desktop feel like my own straight away .
Perhaps other distributions aiming at the novice user should implement some kind of welcome wizard as well , some offer a welcome pop up with a few references but nothing on this level .
It might help people settle in .
The default KDE4 menu is something only a mother could love , but she still could n’t use it in my opinion .
Sorry , it ’s just too fiddly and complicated , it takes 4 clicks to get down to anything useful .
So I chose the Lancelot menu instead .
It reminds me quite a bit of the SLAB menu in OpenSuse or perhaps the MintMenu from Linux Mint .
As I progressed through the Kaptan screens I chose a theme with the KDE tool bar at the top of the screen and added some information about my wireless network .
I also ticked the box at the very end marked “ Add Contrib Repositories ” .
This gives you all the community maintained packages in PISI and vastly broadens the range of available software .
I ’ll talk more about PISI later .
Things were looking good so far but as I tried to go online I realized I was n’t connected to my wireless network .
This seemed odd as I ’d definitely entered all my details correctly in the welcome wizard .
Opening up the system settings tool I quickly found the “ network manager ” applet .
The wireless profile I ’d created had n’t been saved and I was left scratching my head .
It seems much like the partitioning UI I ’d misread before , if you do n’t click apply before you click next it does n’t save your data .
I entered the details again being careful to press apply this time , I was then prompted for the root password and asked to confirm again .
After that the wireless details were saved and the network connection came up fine .
Next I wanted to see if my Nvidia card was using the restricted 3D drivers or not , the screen resolution was correct but enabling 3D desktop effects failed , so I knew the binary drivers were n’t installed .
It turned out this was pretty easy to fix and by typing the search term “ nvidia ” into PISI I was able to find some kernel modules and drivers quickly .
I installed the most recent one I could see , which looked a bit behind the current Nvidia releases but I was n’t too worried about that .
After logging out and restarting the X server a reassuring Nvidia splash screen came up and all was well .
I turned on the 3D effects in KDE4 and I have to say they ’re very slick .
Not quite as heavy duty as the Compiz effects I often use and a bit lighter on resources .
It ’s nice to see that multimedia codecs , Flash , Java and other such things are included here .
I know that ’s a philosophical problem for a lot of people and I ’m with them on that , but since this distro is aimed at the average user they just want their stuff to work without hassle .
We can pitch the Free Software arguments to them later I think , once they ’ve had a chance to get their foot through the door .
The latest Firefox 3.5 is also present by default .
PISI Package Manager :
I briefly mentioned PISI before but I thought it would be worth taking a more in depth look .
It ’s the package managing utility in Pardus and it ’s completely custom built , using its own package format to boot .
No pun intended .
The GUI looks quite similar to the utility you get for this in Mandriva with possibly a passing resemblance to Synaptic too .
It actually works very well and installing new software is simple , provided it ’s in the repos .
I found with the contrib repository enabled I had a very respectable selection of software at my disposal .
I installed Checkgmail , VirtualBox , Pidgin , Audacity , VLC and much more with just a few clicks .
There were some things I could n’t find however such as Terminator , Gwibber , Avant Window Navigator , gPodder and Tasque .
Some of those are Gnome apps and maybe this is the reason , I ’ll discuss some of the KDE alternatives I found in a minute .
One problem I have with PISI is another slight GUI oversight in my view .
It has 2 main views , packages available and packages already installed .
This seems sensible and I have no problem with that in principle , but when you do a search for something , such as “ nvidia ” for example , you have to switch view panes and search again to see if the package you ’re thinking of is installed , not installed or even available to install at all .
I prefer the way Synaptic shows you all the results in one list with a simple mark next to the packages to tell you if they ’re installed or not .
This kind of approach to search results would be a big improvement and save time too .
Other than that very minor annoyance on my part PISI worked well , kept me up to date pretty easily and installed packages without fuss .
You ca n’t say fairer than that .
Learning To Love KDE4 :
OK so “ love ” might be a bit of a strong word , but for an old Gnome fan like me KDE has never really sat comfortably on my desktop .
I found as the week went on though that I got more comfortable with it and found new ways of working .
For example I mentioned earlier that I could n’t find Gwibber in the repos , this is a major problem for a compulsive microblogger , but help was at hand .
After some tips from people on Identi.ca ( via the web interface obviously ) , I discovered that the bizarrely named Choqok is the microblogging client de jour on KDE .
I fired it up and at first I hated it if I ’m honest , mainly because it shows your different accounts in individual tabs and you ca n’t see all your messages in one go .
As I used it more though I got used to this way of doing things and after a while its become natural .
It ’s so much more stable and quick than Gwibber and with some advanced features thrown in , I was very impressed .
Other minor changes were the fact that I could n’t find AWN and install it from the repos .
I may have been able to do so from source but decided to try a different way of working .
When I want to open an app now I do n’t go to the menu or look for a dock , instead I just press ALT + F2 to call up the run box .
You can do this on any system I know but the KDE4 version is very slick .
It predicts what you want as you type and has cool animations .
It reminds me most of how I would use Gnome Do on Gnome actually .
The KDE desktop widgets are something I could n’t really see the point of at first , I ’ve often made jokes that calling them Plasmoids sounds more like something you should go and see the doctor about .
I added a weather widget and system monitor though and it started to make a lot more sense .
I looked through the variety of widgets on offer and grabbed a Gmail checker for my desktop too .
It ’s easy to go overboard and fill your desktop with rubbish but if you use them wisely the Plasmoids are very cool and can be useful .
I even like the Dolphin file manager and I found mounting network shares and saving them was easy .
A little more like the old Windows Explorer way of working , adding network folders and such , but it ’s easy to do .
I used to hate using Konqueror for file management and that was probably one of the major reasons I could n’t stand KDE .
It seemed such an unwieldy beast and it tried to do everything at once rather than just being a file manager .
This is an accusation often levelled at KDE itself actually , that it tries to be all things to all people , giving you so many different ways of doing any one task you get swamped and confused .
I ’ve found it to be like that myself at times in the past and I do n’t know if I ’ve changed or it ’s KDE that ’s changed , maybe we both have .
I found this much more comfortable and productive .
I even scared a few people on Identi.ca by posting that I was really getting into KDE4 now .
I ’m not 100 % converted by any means but I think KDE4 is taking shape after a rocky start , and this is version 4.2.4 not the very latest 4.3 release .
It has wet my appetite to try that out and see how it fares .
I was impressed at how well the system went to sleep and woke up again when closing the lid .
I must have done this 100 times over the course of the week and it never failed me once .
Little touches like the KDE plugger applet are also very handy .
When you plug in any external device it pops up in the tool bar and helps you get things done .
It ’s not all sweetness and light though as I found the desktop can slow down and feel sluggish at times , but this problem was pretty isolated .
KDE4 is a pretty heavy duty desktop and probably not for a slower machine , but on modern hardware it ’s great .
It ’s fair to say that this is the most fulfilling KDE experience I ’ve ever had , and I ’ll be monitoring future releases with interest .
ALSA Problems :
I edited a couple of podcasts in Audacity over the week and I found there were a few issues with ALSA .
Some things I have n’t seen in a while actually .
It seemed to involve Pidgin grabbing the default ALSA device and not letting anything else see it .
So when I opened up Audacity I could n’t get any sound output if Pidgin was running , and it usually is on my desktop .
This is not really a criticism of Pardus in any way , it ’s a long standing design problem with ALSA .
Once a program is using an ALSA device its tied up and that ’s it , others ca n’t use it .
On most systems something like Pulse Audio is used now on top of ALSA to solve this problem .
I ’ve had my issues with Pulse but I have to say having not seen this ALSA problem in a couple of years and largely forgotten about it , I should probably be more grateful to Pulse Audio .
I did n’t see the same problems between many of the KDE programs , it seemed to be just Pidgin .
The default IM client in KDE is Kopete and I ’ve tried that but I still much prefer Pidgin .
Perhaps Kopete would n’t have had the same sound problems .
I found I could fix things by closing Audacity , setting Pidgin to mute sounds and then reopening Audacity .
After that it could see the main ALSA device was free again , but it was a bit of a pain .
Conclusions :
Ease Of Installation & Setup : 4/5
Stability & Speed : 4/5
Community & Online Support : 3/
5
Features : 5/
5
Overall : 4/5
Overall I had a lot of fun with Pardus and it may even have finally taught me the virtues of KDE , which was no small task indeed .
After a week or so on this system I ’ve been able to do everything I ’ve needed to , producing podcasts , writing and getting on with other general dev work , so I ca n’t complain at that .
I like Kaptan , PISI and YALI a lot .
There are many great little custom tools here and I think the developers are taking things in the right direction .
The fact that its not based on Fedora , Debian , Slackware or whatever else probably endears me to this distro .
I like to see people trying new things and when you look at what ’s actually been achieved in a short space of time it ’s amazing .
The packaging system works very well and that ’s impressive for a relatively young development .
I did have to work around the lack of some apps I use heavily .
I installed Guake to help do things in the terminal without Terminator , and I also managed to install Gpodder from source to get all my podcasts .
Gpodder ran very well in fact and this only confirmed my love of Python , it just runs everywhere .
There are some things that could be improved in Pardus .
I mentioned some of the UI problems I had , this might just be the way my brain works but some things seemed more convoluted than they needed to be .
It ’s nothing that ca n’t be fixed with a few tweaks though and hopefully we ’ll see this in future .
The overall feel of the distro is friendly and inclusive , I like that .
There are some good online resources with a forum , wiki and IRC channel should you get stuck , and the documentation is pretty good .
There ’s even an online beginners guide for anyone daunted by their first encounter with Pardus .
With so many other Linux distributions already out there fighting in a crowded market it may be tough for Pardus to find its niche , but they ’re doing a very good job .
I always have time for people who push the boundaries and try new things , without that attitude we ’d never advance .
I would n’t have a problem recommended this distro to most users and I think perhaps novice Linux converts are the best market for it .
It ’s going to be hard to compete with the amount of packages and how - to guides out there already for the likes of Ubuntu but in time I think this distro could grow well .
It offers something different and in a world filled with Ubuntu remixes and Debian clones a little diversity is n’t a bad thing .
If you fancy spicing up your like with a little Turkish flavour give Pardus a spin , it ’s well worth it .

Upcoming :
I was contacted by some people involved with SAM Linux and asked to review it , so I will endeavour to do that next .
I ’ve also been prompted many times about finally getting onto BSD and I will try to do that too .
I ’ve had good fun on Pardus and I may look for something that has KDE 4.3 to see if my romance with the desktop is really love , or just a short lived infatuation .
You ’re welcome to join me next time for the journey of course …
UNITED NATIONS ( CNN ) -- President Obama joined other world leaders Tuesday in calling for immediate and substantive steps to combat climate change , saying failure to act now would bring " irreversible catastrophe . "
President Obama pledges the U.S. government 's commitment to fighting climate change .
Speaking to a special summit on climate change at the United Nations , Obama pledged the full commitment of the United States to a global response after what he called years of responding too slowly to the magnitude of the challenge .
However , Obama 's speech lacked specific details on cutting greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change .
He also warned that the global economic recession could hinder the ability of countries to take necessary steps to combat climate change .
" We seek sweeping but necessary change in the midst of a global recession , where every nation 's most immediate priority is reviving their economy and putting their people back to work , " Obama said .
" And so all of us will face doubts and difficulties in our own capitals as we try to reach a lasting solution to the climate challenge . "
Other nations looking for a strong signal from Obama of new U.S. leadership on the issue seemed reserved .
His speech received polite applause , compared to stronger ovations for other leaders who promised robust targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions .
Watch Obama urge action on addressing climate change »
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon convened the summit to highlight the need for a concerted global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help developing nations cope with rising sea levels , diminishing fresh water sources , reduced agriculture production , increased disease and other current or expected effects of climate change .
Ban called for faster progress on a new international climate change treaty scheduled to be completed in December in Copenhagen , Denmark .
Progress in the negotiations involving almost 200 countries has been slowed by disputes over the roles of industrialized powers and major greenhouse gas emitters such as the United States and emerging nations such as China that have become major emitters in their rush to economic development .
Ban urged negotiators to move beyond old issues in confronting what he called " the pre-eminent geopolitical and economic issue of the 21st century . "
Chinese Premier Hu Jintao , in what was called the first U.N. speech on climate change by a Chinese leader , pledged significant steps by his country to cut greenhouse gas emissions and increase reliance on clean energy sources in coming years .
Hu reiterated past calls by China for industrialized powers to contribute more to a solution because they polluted more in developing their economies .
China will " endeavor " to cut emissions of carbon dioxide -- the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change -- by " a notable margin " in coming years , Hu said , adding that China also will " vigorously develop renewable energy and nuclear energy " with the goal of increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in total energy consumption to 15 percent by 2020 .
In his most specific proposal , Hu said China will increase forest cover by 40 million hectares by 2020 as a way to offset greenhouse gas emissions by industrial polluters , cars , airplanes and other sources .
The increase , equal to more than 150,000 square miles , or an area almost three times larger than New York state , would be based on China 's forest cover in 2005 .
Forests serve as carbon " sinks " by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it .
In his first speech at the United Nations , Obama signaled that the United States expects China to take significant steps as part of a global response to climate change .
Without specifying China by name , Obama said " rapidly growing developing nations that will produce nearly all the growth in global carbon emissions in the decades ahead must do their part , as well . "
" Some of these nations have already made great strides with the development and deployment of clean energy , " Obama said .
" Still , they need to commit to strong measures at home and agree to stand behind those commitments just as the developed nations must stand behind their own .
We cannot meet this challenge unless all the largest emitters of greenhouse gas pollution act together .
There 's no other way . "
Obama acknowledged that the United States has previously failed to recognize the magnitude of the climate change issue .
He pledged his government 's commitment to developing clean energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming .
" We understand the gravity of the climate threat .
We are determined to act .
And we will meet our responsibility to future generations , " Obama said .
Other speakers made impassioned pleas for global consensus on a way forward , warning that failure to reach agreement would mean disaster .
Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt was applauded when he said the European Community has set a target of reducing emissions by 30 percent by 2020 , " more than anyone else so far . "
By comparison , the U.S. goal stated previously by Obama 's administration is for an 80 percent reduction by 2050 , but there was no firm figure for an interim target in 2020 .
Wangari Maathai , who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her environmental activism in Kenya , urged the gathered leaders to " act together , act now , act decently . "
" Your excellencies have the power to turn this around in Copenhagen , " Maathai said .
" Addressing it will take collective political will . "

Following various reports of exploding iPhones and iPod touches , Apple has reportedly informed the European Commission that it has begun a probe into the matter .
In a new report from Reuters , a spokeswoman from the European Union 's consumer safety division stated that Apple is gathering information on a number of events in which users allege devices running the iPhone OS exploded .
Apple has reported the incidents to the union as " isolated , " but will do tests to determine the possible cause .
" What they 've said to us is that they consider these are isolated incidents , " Helen Kearns said at a news briefing .
" They do n't consider that there 's a general problem . "
A spokesman for Apple in Europe added little else : " We are aware of these reports and we are waiting to receive the iPhones from the customers .
Until we have the full details , we do n't have anything further to add . "
Earlier this month , a report from the U.K. over a supposed exploding iPod touch said the company attempted to refund the family only if they agreed to keep quiet .
In that case , an 11 - year - old girl reportedly dropped the device , at which point it hissed , popped , and flew into the air .
After the family requested a refund , Apple sent a letter denying any liability on the company 's part .
It also asked the family to " keep the terms of existence of this settlement agreement completely confidential . "
Reuters also cites a recent incident in which a French teenager was " slightly injured " when his iPhone made a hissing noise and shattered .
The boy 's mother is considering taking legal action against Apple .
Let me start by admitting a persistent befuddlement in the face of many of life 's presumably easily answered questions .
The one that has mystified me the longest is - why , if we 're constantly replacing the cells in our bodies , do we retain scars ?
Get wrinkles as we age ?
Shrink and limp our ways to the grave ?
I am sure a quick PubMed literature search would reveal that this " mystery " is easily explicable by the vagaries of environmentally - caused cell mutations , or some nasty aging , but I 'll leave that science to the biologists and geneticists for now .
I 'm more interested in the science fiction of it all , and what it means for our sense of self .
The face that I saw in the mirror when I was 10 feels like me when I imagine my way back to that time , just as my 20 and 30 year old faces do , and my 40 and 80 year old faces will .
Of course , every cell is different , lines are different , whiskers are different , hair color is different ( right now , I 'm transitioning to my third natural color ... blonde , brown ... yes , now , grey ) .
But it 's still me somehow .
I think this is an awesome mystery .
Everything about us changes , yet we are still us !
Or are we ?!?
Creepy research seems to percolate into my consciousness are fairly regular intervals concerning the influences of microbes on our poor , frail species .
My first creep - out moment was coming across the periodical news releases arising from a cellular census of the human body .
One National Public Radio story had this lead - in : " The human body contains 20 times more microbes than it does cells .
In fact , a visitor from outer space might think the human race is just one big chain of microbe hotels . "
Another story puts the number at more like 10 microbe cells for every human cell , but still !!
Researchers always like to point to the pleasant symbiosis that allows us to digest food , extract more energy from nutrients , and so on , but it still distresses me to think that perhaps people are just pudgy planets for a few thousand generations of microbial civilzations .
What if they do to US what we do to OUR PLANET ?
What , indeed ?
Well , perhaps just pesky little inconveniences like infectious throat bacteria giving us Obsessive - Compulsive Disorder or bird flu giving us Parkinson 's Disease !
I know what you 'll say ... none of these things has been proven yet .
On the other hand , it 's not like I have to try very hard to think of examples where wimpy microbes suddenly morphed into flesh - eating plagues ( although some might argue that strep throat is n't that wimpy ) .
But the last straw was an uber - creepy story about a fungus (! ) that infects a type of ant and somehow makes the ant crawl to a particularly fungi- friendly place under a leaf on a particular side of a particular tree , latch on with its mandibles , and ... DIE !
Granted , an ant 's brain is probably only half as complex as the brain of the average Jackass stuntman - wannabe , but STILL !
Zombie ants under fungal control !
Does this remind anyone of a certain , prescient Star Trek vignette ?
Poor Chekov was minding his own business when a slimy parasite crawled in his ear and took over his brain .
You might think that 's far - fetched , but Star Trek was pretty visionary - I mean , they predicted the Bluetooth earphone !
So what if all of my cells , including a few trillion foreign , microbial invaders , parasites , and hangers - on , have all died and regenerated their way through a few thousand generations ?
So what if - physically - the me who 's typing this wo n't exist on a cellular level , and is mostly not " me " at all ?
Why should that be a problem ?
To me the amazing thing is that it ISN 'T a problem .
Here I am , semi- panicked , yet highly fascinated by the thought of billions of little bacterial buddies bouncing around in my fingertips as I type , trying to imagine the collective annoyance that my microbial amigos will feel when I die ( ' Crap ! ' they 'll grouse , ' now who can we live in ? ' ) .
But it 's still me .
Our brains ( at least the human part of our brains ) just can't seem to help themselves when it comes to weaving together the moments of our lives into a consistent narrative .
In my research , I refer to this as the comprehension , sense - making function of meaning in life .
It is a fundamental human adaptation .
We exist , we bring in sensory information by the boatload , and we assort it all into one mostly seamless movie , which we then live for decades .
The heart of my research and practice is trying to make this process intentional , and work toward out flourishing rather than our deterioration .
We get to shape our stories as we live .
Take a moment to reacquaint yourself with the values you want to drive your life , and work them into your story at every opportunity .
It 's a practice I will continue to strive for every day .
At least until the zombie fungus takes over my brain !

The Lib Dems want tighter controls on surveillance powers for authorities including councils and the police .
More than 500,000 requests to access phone and e-mail records were made in 2008 , a report by the Interception of Communications Commissioner showed .
The Lib Dems say only a magistrate should be able to approve a request for surveillance , under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( Ripa ) .
The Home Office said the powers should be used only when " proportionate " .
' Beggars belief '
An average of about 1,500 surveillance requests were made every day in Britain last year , according to figures which have emerged from an annual report by commissioner Sir Paul Kennedy .
That is the annual equivalent to one in every 78 adults being targeted .
Although slightly down on 2007 , the total number of requests last year was up by more than 40 % on 2006 .
It included 1,500 approved applications from local councils .
The government forgets that George Orwell 's 1984 was a warning , and not a blueprint
Chris Huhne , Lib Dems
Send us your comments Senior officials within these and other public authorities have the power to authorise surveillance .
The Home Office stresses that such actions are closely monitored and that the use of Ripa must be " proportionate " .
But among widely reported examples of the use of Ripa , Poole Borough Council was criticised for watching a couple suspected of lying about their home address in order to get their daughter into an over - subscribed school .
In Bury , Greater Manchester , the council used secretly filmed footage to justify the sacking of three refuse collectors it accused of collecting trade waste - and accepting a bottle of strawberry - flavoured fizzy drink in payment .
A survey of councils last year uncovered the widespread use of covert surveillance to combat littering , fly - tipping and dog- fouling .
Lib
Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said the latest figures on the use of Ripa " beggared belief " .
' Not justified ' " Many of these operations carried out by the police and security services are necessary , but the sheer numbers are daunting , " he said .
" It can not be a justified response to the problems we face in this country that the state is spying on half a million people a year .
" We have sleepwalked into a surveillance state , but without adequate safeguards .
Having the home secretary in charge of authorisation is like asking the fox to guard the hen house .
" The government forgets that George Orwell 's 1984 was a warning and not a blueprint . "
Councils have been criticised for using surveillance to tackle dog fouling Ministers introduced Ripa to help tackle serious crimes including terrorism .
The act allows certain people within councils , police forces and other public bodies to ask for details of when e-mails were sent or phone calls made and to whom , although it does not give them access to their content .
Councils , in particular , have been criticised for using Ripa to investigate more trivial matters , such as dog fouling .
A Home Office spokesman said : " Of course it 's vital that we strike the right balance between individual privacy and collective security and that is why the Home Office is clear these powers should only be used when they are proportionate .
" To ensure the appropriate use of Ripa , the Home Office has recently completed a public consultation on revised codes of practice , and on all public authorities able to use certain techniques relating to Ripa , the ranks at which these techniques can be authorised and the purposes for which they can be used .

Several factors were in play in the 1920s for the emergence of what came to known as flappers , teenagers and young women who flouted convention and spent their time pursuing fun instead of settling down to raise children in the prime of their lives .
Many entered college or the workforce and felt entitled to make their own decisions about how to live their lives .
A lot of young men did not return home from World War I , which left an entire cohort of women without enough husbands to go around .
The horror of the war ( and the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 ) also impressed young people with the knowledge that life is short and could end at any moment .
Instead of staying home preparing to marry a man who might never come , young women wanted to spend what time they had enjoying all that life had to offer .
Movies popularized the image of the fun-loving and free - thinking woman throughout the US and Europe .
The 1920 movie The Flapper introduced the term in the United States .
The title character , Ginger , was a wayward girl who flouted the rules of society .
Played by Olive Thomas , a former Ziegfeld Girl ( left ) , Ginger had so much fun that a generation of lonely young women wanted to be like her .
Another role model was stage and screen actress Louise Brooks ( right ) , who also modeled for artists and fashion designers .
She was the inspiration for the flapper comic strip Dixie Dugan .
Clara
Bow was n't the first flapper on screen , but she was certainly a role model for young women of the era .
She did n't play by the rules , and was tabloid fodder for years for her sexual escapades with the biggest movie stars of the time .
Bow 's first film was in 1922 and her career peaked in 1927 with the film It .
" It " was defined as the sexual allure some girls have and others do n't .
Bow 's fans wanted " it " , so they copied her look and behavior .
The rise of the automobile was another factor in the rise of flapper culture .
Cars meant a woman could come and go as she pleased , travel to speakeasys and other entertainment venues , and use the large vehicles of the day for heavy petting or even sex .
These young women has plenty of opportunities for fun .
Although Prohibition drove alcohol underground , that only added to its allure .
Postwar prosperity allowed for leisure time and the means to spend that time drinking , dancing , and hanging out with free thinkers .
Being a flapper was n't all about fashion .
It was about rebellion .
In this article from 1922 , a would - be flapper ( but still a " nice girl "  ) explains her lifestyle choices to her parents .
Flappers did what society did not expect from young women .
They danced to Jazz Age music , they smoked , they wore makeup , they spoke their own language , and they lived for the moment .
Flapper fashion followed the lifestyle .
Skirts became shorter to make dancing easier .
Corsets were discarded in favor of brassieres that bound their breasts , again to make dancing easier .
The straight shapeless dresses were easy to make and blurred the line between the rich and everyone else .
The look became fashionable because of the lifestyle .
The short hair ?
That was pure rebellion against the older generation 's veneration of long feminine locks .
The party stopped when the economy crashed and the Great Depression curtailed the night life .
Although the flapper lifestyle died along with the Roaring Twenties , the freedoms women tasted in that era were n't easily given up .
They may have gone back to marriage and long hours of toil for little pay , but hemlines stayed above the ankle , and the corset never went back to everyday status .
And we 've been driving cars ever since .
I recently read the book Pleasures of Small Motions : Mastering the Mental Game of Pocket Billiards by Bob Fancher .
In the very first few chapters he talks about our motivation behind playing pool – Some people play because they like to win , others because they like to hang out with their friends and have a little fun .
However one particular group of people , does n’t care about winning and losing , or about socializing .
They play because they LOVE the game .
These are the people who do n’t even need another person to play with and are happy shooting by themselves .
They enjoy drills and practice because they appreciate the beauty in each shot and the practice is a pleasure in itself .
During games , they admire a good shot played by an opponent and cheer them on instead of hoping that the other person misses .
All they care about is learning and improving and enjoying the game .
The moment of victory is much too short to live for that and nothing else .
Martina Navratilova
It is impossible to motivate yourself to practice drills by yourself if you do n’t love billiards and all you care about is winning .
Practice becomes a painful chore that you have to finish before you can reach your wins .
How can you learn and enjoy the game itself if you have to wait till the end of the game to decide whether or not you are allowed to be happy ?
However when the beauty of the game itself motivates you , you can enjoy even watching a good shot .
You realize that a single game means nothing in the grand scheme of things , and your motivation becomes to enjoy each moment and each shot .
You can enjoy shooting well , and be happy whether you win or lose .
Recently I had started caring too much about winning and was extra hard on myself whenever I lost .
After a recent losing streak , I started getting sick of pool and stopped wanting to even play .
Reading this book made me remember why I started playing pool in the first place .
How I used to spend hours at the table by myself just shooting .
How much I loved playing “ that perfect shot ” and watching the ball slowly roll into the pocket .
I ’ve realized it does n’t matter whether I win or lose .
Anytime an opponent makes an unbelievable shot , I usually ask them to teach me the shot after the game .
Each time I see or learn something new , I have to go try it myself .
Suddenly each game is no longer a win / lose situation but an opportunity to learn , improve and enjoy the game of billiards again .
Since then , I ’ve started enjoying pool again .
I ’ve also got a whole lot better .
FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
If you have a few extra dollars in your pocket , how about plunking it down for a dinner with former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin ?
E -bay is auctioning off the chance for a dinner for five with Palin and her husband , Todd .
It will cost you though - with bids starting at $ 25,000 .
Proceeds will go to a veterans ' charity , called Ride 2 Recovery that gives bicycles to wounded vets ... and organizes rides for them as a way to help their recovery .
There are some restrictions - the winner has to pass a background check ...
Palin gets to choose the time and place of dinner , which will last no longer than four hours but could be less at the sole discretion of Ms. Palin .
Plus she gets to bring along up to 3 guests , and you have to pick up the tab .
Some things never change .
The dinner is described by the charity as " the chance of a lifetime " ... adding that Palin is " quite simply , one of the most talked about people in the U.S. "
The value of the dinner is described as " priceless . "
So far , there are about a dozen bids .
And if $ 25,000 is out of your range ... there 's also the chance to have lunch with Karl Rove .
Bids for that start at $ 7,500 .
The lunch for three - with the man President George W. Bush affectionately called " turd blossom " - will take place at a steak house in Washington .
Here ’s my question to you :
What would you give to have dinner with Sarah Palin or Karl Rove ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Bill from Michigan writes :
Would n't giving up my time be enough ?
It already sounds like a bad date , leaving me with the tab .
I can , however , tell you that I would like to bring a geographer , an historian , and a translator with me as my guests .
She might just learn something .
Missy from Phoenix writes :
The auction is for charity .
Give the woman credit .
I 'd think for a good cause most people would be willing to give what they could .
And is n't it always fun to have a lively conversation with someone who you might not agree with ideologically ?
Pity the person who only dines with people they agree with .
Fitz from New York writes :
I 'd rather have surgery , but thanks anyway .
Dustin from Temperance , Michigan writes :
I would prefer eating dinner with Palin so I can have deep conversations about how she can see Russia from her house .
We also could talk about her new book " Governing for Dummies " .
The highlight of the evening would be listening to Palin try to answer simple questions from the waitress .
" How would you like that steak ? "
Teri from Palm Coast , Florida writes :
You could n't pay me to have dinner with either one of them !
They are right at the top of the list of blame when it comes to what happened to our country .
A liar and an idiot , no thanks .
Life is too short and filled with enough garbage as it is , so why ruin a meal ?
Robert writes :
I would love to sit down and talk to Rove .
I believe he would be one of the more interesting people to talk to .
Great insight , great instincts .
In fact , I just put in a bid .
Diane writes :
I would n’t let my dog eat with either one of them .
Tom from Forest Hills , Pennsylvania writes :
What would I give ?
My dead mother - in - law .
It feels great to say that after a full decade I still enjoy using metapad on all of my Windows installations .
Today marks the 10th aniversary of the first public release of metapad ( see the history page if you do n’t believe me ) .
To celebrate I have finally , after long promise , released the source code for metapad .
That ’s right , now metapad is officially open source and available on GitHub .
Not just freeware but truly “ free software ” , as is defined by the FSF .
I started developing metapad back in early 1999 when I was an intern at a very cool Toronto based media company called ( at the time ) Digital Renaissance .
It was my second internship there and I had graduated from VB programmer to C++ programmer ( woohoo ! ) and I was pretty stoked to be learning the ins and outs of hardcore object oriented Windows programming with MFC .
But I guess I was pretty good at squashing the bugs they were throwing at me because I had a lot of free time on my hands …
So I decided to write my own text editor — one that was as fast and lightweight as Microsoft ’s Notepad but had some serious features that people could use to , say , write the front - end code for a web site .
Plus back in ’99 most folks still used these things called modems so downloading software was a pretty big deal .
The fact that the initial release of metapad was less than 20 kilobytes was an important factor in its relative success .
( Competing products that relied on fat runtime libraries were ten to fifty times larger than metapad ) .
Other than the superiority of metapad ’s size , speed and feature list , there were two other major factors contributing to its overall success : suporters and multiple language support .
Very soon after metapad was released , an up and coming tech email newsletter called Lockergnome run by one Chris Pirillo , decided to recommend metapad .
A little later on , I was very proud to get a 4 star and then an upgraded 5 star editors ’ pick rating from ZDNet , the publisher of the once popular and powerful PC Magazine .
A sincere thanks goes out to Chris and to the editors at Ziff Davis as well as all the other sites around the world that helped to spread the word about metapad .
In the year 2001 I came up with the idea to let volunteers translate metapad ’s user interface ( very similar to what Facebook has recently done ) .
Thanks to the dedicated efforts of some computer savy , multi-lingual metapad users from around the globe , metapad is currently available in 32 languages other than english ( each available as a downloadable plugin ) .
I was amazed to discover that since I installed Google Analytics in late 2005 , there have been 442,881 visits ( generating just shy of a million pageviews ) coming from 212 different countries !
Here ’s a graph of the visitors by country ( breaking out the top 10 ) .
Special thanks to Florian Balmer , Aaron Hawley , Carlos Fleitas and all the other users who submitted bug reports , feature requests and kind words .
All of your feedback and support was what drove me to improve metapad from v1 to v3.5 .
Big thanks to all who have sent donations which have generously helped me maintain the website .

New York decided to hand Osama a victory after all .
Al Qaeda did n’t bring the city to its knees on 9/11 .
But , as of today ’s eighth anniversary , we ’ve failed utterly to replace what the terrorists destroyed .
Ground Zero remains a pit — and looks to stay that way for the foreseeable future .
Some naive souls fall for the official claims that “ progress ” is being made at a supposedly full - bore construction site .
Newsday just reported excitedly that structural steel for 1 WTC has risen 100 feet above street level , compared with “ only ” 25 feet a year ago .
Gee , that leaves 1,676 feet to go .
At 75 feet a year , it will only take until mid-2031 to finish the job .
What ’s mostly being done is infrastructure work that should ’ve been finished years ago .
Only one of Larry Silverstein ’s office buildings , Tower 4 , has even started — below ground .
The models and images — like the renderings of Towers 2 , 3 and 4 posted around the site — are a cruel joke , and the public knows it .
It ’s impossible to imagine any of them rising soon — if ever .
The “ World Trade Center Transportation Hub ” — a $ 3.4 billion temple to New Jersey commuterdom — is as much a tease .
Its famous “ wings ” are n’t even bid out yet ; do n’t be surprised if no contractor is willing to do the job for anything like what the PA can pay .
After eight years of political obstruction and Port Authority stalling , Silverstein finally got land he can build on — only to be foiled by an unforgiving credit market that ’s snuffed out construction lending .
That ’s given a dubious plausibility to the PA ’s claim that it ’s Silverstein who ’s holding up the works .
Of course , he could have started work years ago — if the PA had managed to turn the site over to him , as it was supposed to , in build - ready condition .
Now the PA has balked at Silverstein ’s plea for financing help .
It has a point , if not quite a case :
It was never expected to help bankroll the developer ’s towers .
It ’s hard to see where “ binding ” arbitration , insisted upon by Silverstein , can lead — except to indefinitely drawn - out litigation .
Only the unloved , morbid Memorial has found traction — and even it will only be partly done by Sept. 11 , 2011 .
Things near the site are no better .
The singular exception is Silverstein ’s 7 WTC — an eloquent reproach to the zero that ’s Ground Zero .
But eight years later , the blackened hulks of 130 Liberty St. ( the Deutsche Bank building ) and Fiterman Hall yet stand .
How did we come to this ?
We let our “ leaders ” do essentially nothing for nearly five years after 9/11 — a time when the boom could have supported Silverstein ’s borrowing effort and provided tenants for his towers .
The corrupt , rudderless state government is mostly to blame .
Then - Gov. George Pataki wasted 2002 and 2003 setting up an impotent Lower Manhattan Development Corp .
He authorized interminable design competitions , then overrode his advisers to choose the Daniel Libeskind site plan — which was so inappropriate that it took another year of emendation to make it even remotely buildable .
Even after endless tweaking , the plan — which ought to embrace a soaring verticality to exceed the Twin Towers ’ impact on the skyline — remains infuriatingly overcrowded and focused underground , both at the Memorial and the PATH terminal .
Pataki prohibited building on the Twin Tower footprints , thus forcing new buildings into too small a space .
He fussed with the original Freedom Tower design — even as he ignored the NYPD ’s objections to the tower ’s location on security grounds , concerns that would force a complete redrawing of the structure , delaying everything by yet another year .
The scandals of 130 Liberty St. and Fiterman Hall are also the state ’s doing ; the LMDC controls the former , while the state - dominated City University of New York owns the latter .
Blame also George W. Bush , a wartime president who was oblivious to the symbolic urgency of swiftly rebuilding the World Trade Center .
If he ever picked up the phone to say , Boys , let ’s get on with the job , it ’s never been reported .
Mayor Bloomberg dithered until 2006 , when he brokered a deal that forced Silverstein to cede Tower 1 to the PA — which is building it at the slowest pace since the elements forged the Grand Canyon .
Rudy Giuliani , a 9/11 hero , called for the entire WTC site to be made into a memorial — lending rhetorical throw - weight to the insidious campaign led by The New York Times against commercial rebuilding .
And we ’re all to blame .
How ?
For allowing most of the $ 20 billion the feds sent to rebuild Lower Manhattan to be wasted on tax credits and ancillary projects — even on new buildings far from Ground Zero — instead of the one thing that was needed : a new World Trade Center .

After part 1 , part 2 , part 3 and part 4 of this guide , we now have fully functional boids .
In this part of the guide I take the first look at performance .
Our boids are functionally complete .
And they ’re concurrent — we have a thread per boid , one for the cell and one for the display .
But will this translate into a parallel speedup ?
To find out , I needed more than the netbook on which I ’m writing this post .
Thanks to Fred Barnes , I have a login on an eight - core x86 machine ( “ Intel ( R ) Xeon ( R ) E5310 @ 1.60 GHz ” ) called octopus :
So I darcs - pushed my code from part 4 across to octopus .
I stripped out the display aspect and changed the program to run 2000 frames before exiting , forcing the evaluation of the boids ’ position each frame .
That way I should be able to time how long the program takes to run on different numbers of cores .
The appropriate GHC option is “ + RTS - Nx ” , where x is 1 through 8 for the number of cores we want to use .
I then graphed the results — the red line represents perfect speed - up ( based on the one - core version divided by the number of cores ) , the blue line is the actual time .
Here ’s my first result :
That huge spike on the right is obviously some sort of oddity in the run-time .
I filed ticket # 3518 , but for now setting the heap with “ - H400 M ” clears it up :
Anyway , the overall result of the graphs is bad .
Our program is taking longer ( in wall - clock time ) the more cores we add .
Rather than parallel speed - up , we have parallel slow - down .
So what can we do about it ?
Given that we are in Haskell , it is instructive to think about where and when the values in our program are actually being evaluated .
Our channels are not strict , so values sent down channels can be unevaluated thunks .
Our intention in having a process per boid was to enable parallel speed - up .
So a good step is to make sure that the boid evaluates its new velocity ( rather than leaving it to the cell process ) .
This is quite a simple matter — CHP provides a writeChannelStrict function that is just like writeChannel , but that uses the Control .
Parallel .
Strategies stuff to force evaluation .
So we add some instances to enable that :
instance NFData BoidVel where rnf ( BoidVel a b ) = rnf a > | rnf b
Then in the boid code , we change writeChannel out cur to writeChannelStrict out cur .
And that ’s all that was needed to add the strictness .
Now we can time it again :
That is a little better ( if you compare the graphs closely ) , but we still have parallel slow - down rather than speed - up .
But our boids should be able to get parallel speed - up by evaluating their new position in parallel .
Let ’s consider what is happening with the cell and the boids as a possible cause .
Here ’s the cell code again :
cell ' pos = do vels <- mapM readChannel inputs let new Pos = zipWith updateInfo pos vels writeChannel outputPos newPos zipWithM_ writeChannel outputs ( nearby 0.05 newPos ) cell ' newPos
The cell process reads in the boid velocities sequentially , then sends out the new positions ( trivially calculated from the velocities and old positions ) to the drawing process , then sends out the neighbour information sequentially ( what may happen is that each boid is sent a thunk that will calculate neighbour information — so each boid will calculate neighbour information in parallel rather than the cell doing it and forming a bottleneck — which would be neat ! ) then recurses .
Hmmm — there are a few too many mentions of “ sequentially ” in that sentence !
We missed an opportunity for concurrency , so let ’s rectify that :
cell ' pos = do vels <- runParallel $ map readChannel inputs let new Pos = zipWith updateInfo pos vels writeChannel outputPos newPos runParallel_ $ zipWith writeChannel outputs ( nearby 0.05 newPos ) cell ' newPos
We just change our uses of mapM and zipWithM into map and zipWith , then pass the results of these ( lists of monadic actions ) to runParallel .
Let ’s see if that made a difference :
Those two changes ( the strict - send and the parallel communications ) have finally delivered some parallel speed - up .
It ’s not as much as we might wish for , as it seems to tail off around 2.5 x speed - up .
I hope to investigate this further at some point , but I suspect that the ratio of communication to computation may be part of the problem .
Optimising for parallel performance is hard in any setting , and being in Haskell ( which makes it hard enough to optimise for sequential execution ) certainly makes life interesting .
Perhaps I can wildly generalise this post to throw together some guidelines on optimising :
If your performance numbers are very odd , look to the garbage collector .
( Don Stewart also recommends keeping an eye on GC when trying to get parallel speed - up . )
Try to work out where and when your values are actually being evaluated .
In general , if the values are used to take a different monadic action , or if they are sent out of the program , they are forced .
Otherwise they probably are n’t , and are being sent around as thunks .
Find where you want values to be evaluated to get the most speed - up and try changing writeChannel to writeChannelStrict .
Vary the amount of parallelism .
In this example , my sequential communications needed to be made parallel .
Sometimes the opposite is true .
Optimisation is not straightforward ( alas ) .
Dear Colleagues :
A number of people have written to me in response to the Commentary on “ pets ” to ask about the issue of non-vegan cats .
It is my understanding that many cats can live healthy lives on a vegan diet but what if there are cats who absolutely need to consume animal products ?
In this Commentary , I offer some ideas that I hope will stimulate your thinking about this issue .

The Obama administration is moving forward with one of its most fundamental financial reforms , a plan to constrain the growth and risk - taking of giant banks and other firms .
The plan is the keystone of the administration ’s broader effort to reverse a generation of public policy that strongly favored the emergence of behemoths such as Citigroup .
The government now wants to pressure such firms to become smaller , more stable and less likely to need the sort of massive federal bailouts that have defined the current economic crisis .
Regulators would require all financial firms to hold larger capital reserves against unexpected losses .
The largest firms would be forced to set aside even greater reserves , the rough equivalent of requiring a racehorse to carry more weight .

A rapid evolutionary shift has caused this deer mouse to have lighter fur ( Image : Emily Kay )
Deer mice have pulled off the opposite trick to the famous peppered moth , evolving a light coat to disguise themselves from predators .
What ’s more , they did it even though their ancestors had no genes for light coats .
Most deer mice have dark fur , which would stand out vividly against the pale - coloured Sand Hills of Nebraska .
The hills formed around 10,000 years ago , but genetic analysis performed by Catherine Linnen of Harvard University and colleagues found that back then the deer mouse genome did n’t contain the genes for light fur .
That means the trait arose from a new mutation which rapidly spread through the local deer mouse population .
The mutation is in a gene called Agouti , which helps control coat colour in many mammals .

“ We found a very strong association between a single amino acid deletion , in a functionally important part of the gene , and the colour phenotype , ” Linnen says .
Ron Woodruff , an evolutionary biologist at Bowling Green State University , Ohio , says the results are striking .
“ Any cases where you can find positive selection for a mutation are interesting , ” he says .
Standing start
The amount of genetic variation in the new version of Agouti suggests the mutation occurred less than 10,000 years ago , Linnen says – after the formation of the Sand Hills .
“ An older mutation would show lots of variation , ” she says .
Normally , to achieve such a rapid evolutionary shift a species needs to have an alternative version of a gene already in circulation .
A change in conditions – such as trees becoming darker as they get covered in soot , in the case of the peppered moth – can then provide the selection pressure that causes the alternate gene to spread .
But in deer mice the new version of Agouti spread rapidly from a standing start .
Woodruff says that these “ de novo ” mutations – which occur after a species has encountered the situation where they will be useful , rather than before – may be more important for evolution than biologists think .
If the Agouti mutation occurred in just one mouse , the chances of it spreading rapidly through the whole population would be slim , which is why newly arising mutations like this have been thought to be unimportant .
But Woodruff points out that mutations can occur while an animal is in the womb .
If this occurs early enough , the mutation may be present in many of its sperm or egg cells .
Then the animal could have several offspring with the mutation , making it easier for the mutation to spread .
He says , “ Beneficial mutations occur by both mechanisms : pre-existing variations and de novo mutations .
The debate is , what is the proportion of the two ? ”

Visceral Games ‘ , Dante ’s Inferno is a dark descent into hell .
The entire concept is very reminiscent of God of War and there has been no end to the comparisons of the two games .
One big difference was God of War III was playable at E3 .
Dante was only playable behind closed doors .
This week , Dante has his first public gameplay demonstrations .
According to a recent press release , Dante ’s Inferno will be in playable form at Comic - Con .
This is not limited to elite members of the press , but is open to anyone who stops by EA ‘s booth ( Booth # 5213 ) during the event .
Despite evidence implicating the current Pakistani army chief , Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani , in a major military assistance program for the Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan over the past few years , senior officials of the Barack Obama administration persuaded Congress to extend military assistance to Pakistan for five years without any assurance that the Pakistani assistance to the Taliban had ended .
Those officials , led by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm .
Mike Mullen , have been arguing that Kayani is committed to ending support the Taliban and other radical Islamic movements receive from the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) Directorate , but that he is not yet able to control ISI operatives .
Late last year , U.S. officials were reportedly pressing Kayani for far - reaching changes in the ISI that would end its role in support of insurgents in Afghanistan and Kashmir .
Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) demanded that the ISI be put under civilian control and threatened to introduce legislation making military assistance to Pakistan conditional on evidence that the Pakistani military had ended such support to the Taliban .
But Kerry dropped his proposal for conditioning U.S. military assistance to Pakistan on ending the ISI - Taliban program .
In February Kerry said conversations with Mullen and " other players " had persuaded him that Kayani and his choice for new ISI chief , Ahmad Shuja Pasha , had " a willingness to engage in transformation " of the ISI .
The Kerry - Lugar legislation passed by the Senate in June provides $ 2 billion in military aid as well as $ 4 billion in economic assistance to Pakistan over five years and makes no mention of evidence of military aid to the Taliban .
It merely requires the secretary of state to certify that the " security forces of Pakistan " are making concerted efforts to prevent the Taliban and associated militant groups from using the territory of Pakistan as a sanctuary from which to launch attacks within Afghanistan . "
Obama ’s national security team established a critical basis for its argument to Congress by leaking a story to the New York Times asserting that Kayani would not be able to control the activities of ISI in the short run .
The story , published March 26 , acknowledged " direct support from operatives " of the ISI for the Afghan Taliban insurgency , but it quoted anonymous U.S. officials saying it is " unlikely that top officials in Islamabad are directly coordinating the clandestine efforts "  a carefully chosen formula that does not deny that they are presiding over a policy of aiding the Taliban .
The story said unnamed U.S. officials " have also said that mid-level ISI operatives occasionally cultivate relationships that are not approved by their bosses . "
That statement diverted attention away from whether the Pakistani military leadership has approved military assistance to the Taliban .
Mullen has been suggesting that Kayani has demonstrated good faith by purging the ISI .
He told Trudy Rubin of the Philadelphia Inquirer in early April that the new head was " handpicked " to change the ISI .
Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee May 21 , Mullen emphasized that Gen. Kayani had changed " almost the entire leadership of ISI " over the previous six months .
After a conversation with Mullen , Washington Post columnist David Ignatius quoted him in a June 29 article as saying that Kayani and his choice for ISI chief " have committed very specifically to change the culture of ISI , " but that " that ’s not going to happen overnight . "
Mullen has carefully avoided saying that Kayani has given assurances he intends to halt the military assistance to the Taliban , however .
The historical evidence on Kayani ’s past relationship to the issue suggests that he has no intention of changing Pakistani policy toward the Taliban .
Kayani himself served as head of ISI from late 2004 to late 2007 and presided over the development of a major logistical and training program for the Taliban forces operating out of Pakistan ’s Baluchistan province .
The ISI military assistance program was first revealed in a NATO report of a two - week battle by NATO forces against a determined Taliban offensive in Kandahar province in September 2006 .
During the battle , NATO forces captured a number of Pakistani fighters who detailed the ISI role in supporting the Taliban offensive .
The NATO account , reported in the Telegraph by Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid on Oct. 6 , 2006 , described two ISI training camps for the Taliban near Quetta in Pakistan ’s Baluchistan province .
It also documented the provision by the ISI of 2,000 rocket - propelled grenades and 400,000 rounds of ammunition  just for that one Taliban campaign .
The size and scope of the program of support described in the report were hardly consistent with the idea that assistance to the Taliban is a rogue operation by ISI operatives .
Mullen and Defense Secretary Robert Gates presumably know about Kayani ’s past support for the Taliban assistance program .
Evidence of continuing ISI assistance to , and safe have for , Taliban forces after Kayani replaced Musharraf as the top Army general was compiled in an intelligence assessment circulated to the top national security officials of the George W. Bush administration in mid-2008 , according by David Sanger ’s book The Inheritance .
Kayani was also overheard in a conversation intercepted by U.S. intelligence referring to a high - ranking Taliban leader , Maulavi Jalaluddin Haqqani , as a " strategic asset , " according to Sanger ’s account .
Haqqani was a Taliban minister during that organization ’s brief period in power during the late 1990s , and his network has been a key target for the U.S. campaign of drone strikes in Pakistan during 2008 and 2009 .
Kayani is not the first Pakistani military leader to assure the U.S. that he is purging the ISI of pro-Taliban elements .
President Pervez Musharraf did the same thing to ease pressure from Washington to toe the line on Afghanistan in early October 2001 .
Musharraf claimed he had made far - reaching changes in the ISI by removing its director , Mahmood Ahmad  who he said had been affiliated with Islamic extremists .
But Musharraf never changed his pro-Taliban policy ; despite his pledge to do so immediately after the 9/11 terror attacks .
The March 26 Times story reported Pakistani officials as portraying their Taliban policy as " part of a strategy to maintain influence in Afghanistan for the day when American forces would withdraw " leaving " a power vacuum to be filled by India . "
After the Times story , Gates began arguing that the U.S. must convince Pakistani leaders that it will not abandon the war in Afghanistan .
In a March 29 interview with Fox News , Gates said the Pakistanis had ties with the Taliban " partly as a hedge against what might happen in Afghanistan if we were to walk away or whatever . "
The U.S. has to convince the Pakistanis that " they can count on us and that they do n’t need that hedge , " Gates said .
Mullen and other U.S. military leaders have an interest other than Afghanistan  which appears to driving their willingness to overlook Kayani ’s past and present support for the Taliban .
They once had close ties with the Pakistani military , which they touted for decades as a basis for U.S. influence in the country , despite persistent and sharp divergences in U.S. and Pakistani strategic interests .
Those ties were cut off in the 1990s because of legislation requiring an end to military cooperation over Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons program .
Mullen and other military leaders now argue that close relations must be a top U.S. priority .
As Mullen told the Inquirer ‘s Rubin , " One of my strategic objectives is to close this gap in the relationship with the Pakistani military . "

Happy 2nd Amendment Weekend Sales Tax Holiday , everyone !
An observance of that name is underway this weekend in Louisiana , thanks to a law signed by Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal in July .
It decrees that each year , on the first Friday through Sunday in September , shoppers in the Bayou State shall be exempt from paying state or local taxes on firearms , ammunition or hunting supplies .
The law was sponsored by state Sen. Robert Marionneaux Jr. , who said in a statement that it will “ save families money , boost retailers ’ sales , and help our economy in this worldwide recession where every little bit helps . ”
For Randy Matthews , owner of the Cash - N - A - Flash pawn and gun shop in Bossier City , in the state ’s northwest corner , the boost to business was a nice bonus , although the pawn business is booming anyway in the recession .
Advertisement
What Matthews appreciated more , however , was the message the event was sending to the White House and beyond .
The law shows that government “ is not just trying to attack gun rights , but trying to actually support them , ” he said .
That was a key goal of the National Rifle Assn. , which worked with state legislators to craft the bill .
Guns sales have surged famously with the election of Barack Obama in November , as gun owners feared a curtailment of their rights under a liberal administration .

President Obama and the Democratic Congress have not made gun control a priority so far ; in fact , the president signed a bill that allows licensed gun owners to carry loaded weapons into national parks and wildlife refuges .
But the fear of an expanded crackdown remains .
Sightings of gun-packing citizens at heated town hall healthcare rallies and near presidential appearances have helped keep the issue in the news .
The tax holiday appeared to spark little concern in Louisiana , where a rich hunting and fishing tradition is celebrated by the official state slogan , “ Sportsman ’s Paradise . ”
The bill ’s sponsor , Marionneaux , who hails from tiny Livonia , just west of Baton Rouge , is a Democrat .

But Josh Sugarmann , executive director of the Violence Policy Center in Washington , D.C. , pointed out that Louisiana has the highest gun death rate of any state in the nation -- 19.58 deaths per 100,000 people , according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2006 , the most recent figures available .
In its 2008 score card of states , the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence ranked Louisiana last in the nation , tied with Kentucky and Oklahoma , for what the gun-control group calls “ sensible gun laws . ”
“ This goes beyond ironic to absurdist , ” Sugarmann said of the tax holiday .
“ The question is , what are they going to offer next ?
Tax holidays on coffins ? ”
Matthews , the Bossier City gun dealer , scoffed at the idea that the guns going out his door would be used for anything other than the hunt , noting that background checks ensure the weapons go to upstanding citizens .

This week , he has set aside two Remington shotguns , as well as a 30 - aught - 6 and a Weatherby .270 rifle for customers who said they ’d pick them up this weekend .
Dove season around here starts today , with deer season not far behind .
Last year , South Carolina approved a gun tax holiday similar to the Louisiana measure .
Rachel Parsons , a spokeswoman for the NRA , said a bill to create an Oklahoma gun tax holiday is pending in that state ’s Legislature .

At 27 both these monkeys are elderly , but it 's the one on the left who has eaten more over his lifetime and looks the worse for wear
Cutting calories may delay the ageing process and reduce the risk of disease , a long - term study of monkeys suggests .
The benefits of calorie restriction are well documented in animals , but now the results have been replicated in a close relative of man over a lengthy period .
Over 20 years , monkeys whose diets were not restricted were nearly three times more likely to have died than those whose calories were counted .
Writing in Science , the US researchers hailed the " major effect " of the diet .
It involved reducing calorie intake by 30 % while maintaining nutrition and appeared to impact upon many forms of age - related disease seen in monkeys , including cancer , diabetes , cardiovascular disease and brain atrophy .
Whether the same effects would be seen in humans is unclear , although anecdotal evidence so far suggests people on a long - term calorie - restricted diet have better cardiovascular health .
The precise mechanism is yet to be established : theories involve changes in the body 's metabolism or a reduction in the production of " free radical " chemicals which can cause damage .
And here they are again
Seventy - six rhesus monkeys were involved in the trial , which began in 1989 and was expanded in 1994 .
Half had their diets restricted , half were given free rein at feeding time .
The rate of cancers and cardiovascular disease in dieting animals was less than half of those permitted to eat freely .
While diabetes and problems with glucose regulation were common in monkeys who ate what they wanted , there were no cases in the calorie controlled group .
People would have to weigh up whether they are prepared to compromise their enjoyment of food for the uncertain promise of a longer life
Catherine Collins
BDA
In addition , while most brains shrink with age , the restricted diet appeared to maintain the volume of the brain at least in some regions .
In particular , the areas associated with movement and memory seemed to be better preserved .
" Both motor speed and mental speed slow down with ageing , " said Sterling Johnson , a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin - Madison School of Medicine .
" Those are the areas which we found to be better preserved .
We can't yet make the claim that a difference in diet is associated with functional change because those studies are still ongoing .
" What we know so far is that there are regional differences in brain mass that appear to be related to diet . "
Earlier this year , German researchers published findings from their study of elderly people which suggested that calorie reduction appeared to improve memory over a period of just three months .
Various studies on the positive effects of calorie restriction on the life spans of various organisms - from yeast to dogs - have been published over the last 70 years
But dieticians sounded a note of warning .
" Monkeys may be a close relation but there are significant differences which means not everything we see in them can be translated to humans , " said Catherine Collins , spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association .
" And there should be some serious reservations about cutting calories so dramatically , particularly for anyone under the age of 30 .
Any such diet would need to be very balanced to avoid malnutrition , and it would be a long - term commitment .
" People would have to weigh up whether they are prepared to compromise their enjoyment of food for the uncertain promise of a longer life , and a life which could be dogged by all sorts of problems - including osteoporosis . "

Valentino Rossi has revealed that he did speak to Ferrari about the possibility of racing for the team at the Italian Grand Prix .
The MotoGP champion had considered a switch to F1 with Ferrari a few years ago before committing himself to motorbikes - and was once again linked with a move as the Maranello - outfit sought a replacement for Luca Badoer as stand - in for Felipe Massa .
However , Rossi said that the lack of preparation on his neck and the limited opportunity to get mileage in the car , allied to his current title battle in motorcycle racing , meant he decided to turn his back on the idea .
" We spoke with Domenicali , but we had two big problems , " he said during preparations for this weekend 's MotoGP race at Misano in Italy .
" The first one is the neck , because I do n't know if I would be able to finish the race with my neck .
Monza is not very strong for [ hard on ] the neck , but anyway it still needs great effort .
" And also , because we 're fighting for the [ MotoGP ] championship , for sure the race at Monza would be a big stress and it's better to stay in MotoGP . "
Rossi said that even prior to speaking to Domenicali he had already been reluctant to take on the opportunity of an F1 race because of the lacking of available testing .
" We had already decided before , that to go into a Formula 1 race without testing the car is more risky than fun , " he said .
" It 's not possible to arrive over there and do all the work to understand the car in just three days . "
I help coach my school ’s Speech Team .
I think I ’m going to plan a pre-season party to get everyone pumped up about the tournaments ahead —
We ’re going to listen to a motivations speaker and get dinner together .
I wo n’t ask the administrators for money , but I am borrowing a school bus .
Another coach will pay for the gas , though .
No one * has * to go , but seriously … they should all go if they know what ’s best for them .
Oh .
And on the way to dinner , I ’m going to take everyone to a local atheist Meetup , where they can perform the Blasphemy Challenge on video , get “ debaptized ” with a blow dryer , and play Pin the Tail on the Jesus .
That should be ok , right ?
…
You can imagine the reaction if any atheist did that .
No doubt every Christian Right group would be after your head .
Your bosses would ( rightfully ) get rid of you .
FOXNews would have a field day .
So why has there been little to no repercussion for Scott Mooney , the head football coach at Breckinridge County High School in Louisville Harned , Kentucky , who took his players to get baptized ?
The coach took about 20 players on a school bus late last month to his church , where nearly half of them … were baptized .
… the school district ’s superintendent was there and did not object .
…
But Superintendent Janet Meeks , who is a member of the church and witnessed the baptisms , said she thinks the trip was proper because attendance was not required , and another coach paid for the gas .
Meeks said parents were n’t given permission slips to sign but knew the event would include a church service , if not specifically a baptism .
She said eight or nine players came forward and were baptized .
“ None of the players were rewarded for going and none were punished for not going , ” Meeks said .
Surely , even the Religious Right is n’t defending this …
Oh , wait .
Enter Mat Staver :
… Staver , founder and general counsel for Liberty Counsel , an Orlando - based group that provides free legal assistance in religious liberty cases , said there was nothing wrong with trip as long as it was voluntary and no public funds were used .
He compared it to a coach inviting players to attend a play or to go see a baseball game .
Unless the bus was owned by the coach , public funds were used .
And again , I ask what Staver would be saying if this was n’t a Christian coach but an atheist one .
The students are saying they knew the church visit would be part of the trip .
This coach knew exactly what he was doing .
One mother is hopefully taking action :
[ Michelle ]
Ammons , who lives in Big Spring , said that she is a Baptist but her husband , Danny , is Catholic , and that both feel like their son should wait until he is 18 to make important decisions on religion .
“ We felt he was brainwashed , ” she said .
She said she was prepared to drop the matter until she found out that Meeks attended the service .
She said she consulted a lawyer in Elizabethtown but has n’t decided what action she will take .
“ They have no right to take my son on a school bus across county lines to be a church to be baptized , ” she said .
No they do n’t , and this coach and the superintendent should be out of jobs right now .
They took advantage of teenagers who were n’t about to say no to their head coach and superintendent and abused their responsibility as educators .
There needs to be a bigger uproar over this .
I hope Ammons pursues her lawsuit and wins .

Athena , according to Greek myth , was born out of Zeus ' head , with a sword in one hand and a shield in the other .
The Oracle , Gaia , had predicted a god from the 3rd generation of the Mt. Olympus pantheon to take over the reigns from Zeus .
Revered by the ancient Greeks as the goddess of both war and intellect , Athena was believed to be that god / goddess .
To celebrate her during festivals dedicated to her worship , Athenians would perform the Pyrrhic dance .
The Pyrrhic dance was an inter-tribal athletic competition at the Panathenaica festival performed in armor by young Athenian men .
According to Roger Dunkle , a Professor of Greek Mythology in the Classics Department at Brooklyn College , the dancers , in a kind of ballet , would emulate offensive and defensive movements derived from warfare .
The dance is said to have been first performed by Athena herself in a celebration of her fellow Olympians ' epic victory over the Giants .
This dance , and other athletic events from the Panathenaica Festival basically continued until Christianity came to Greece and eliminated much of the Ancient Greek pagan traditions from the region .
When Alexander the Great came to power after the assassination of hs father , Phillip of Macedonia , in 336 BC , the newly appointed 20 - year - old king saw himself as a second coming of Achilles , with a destiny devoted to defeating ' barbarians ' .
He began by quelling Greek rebellions , and moved on to revenge against the Persians .
Along the way , he conquered Asia Minor , Syria , Palestine , Egypt , and Mesopotamia , before subduing Persia .
He then went further and defeated Transoxania before reaching as far as the Indus River , before being forced by his troops to turn back .
On his way back , en route to taking over Arabia , he fell ill and died .
Alexanders army consisted of over 30,000 Greek and Macedonian soldiers .
Each trained with a Greek - style military training .
Alexander the Great , wherever he went , settled new cities .
It is estimates that he created over 70 cities .
Every city in which he conquered , he supplanted Greek men to govern ad intermarry with the local population .
His brief empire was called the Hellenistic Empire .
After his death , the empire fell into three Hellenistic kingdoms ; Egypt , Bactria , and Macedonia / Greece .
It is towards the Eastern end of Bactria that I now shift my focus .
During Alexanders stay , and continued conflict with the Pashtuns ( or who would come to be known as Pashtuns ) , in what we know today as the Federally - Administered Tribal Area along the border of modern - day Afghanistan and Pakistan , Greek soldiers mixed with some local Pashtun tribes .
Chief among the tribes making claims to some kind of Greek ancestry are the Khattak tribe and the Ghilzai tribe .
Genetic studies have shown a small trace of Greek ancestry among some Pashtun tribes , confirming these historical claims .
It also helps to clarify the origins of the Attan Dance .
Te dance itself is now an umbrella name for numerous variations of the dance , including the Kibali Attan , Wardaki , Logari , Paktia / Khosti , Kochyano / Kuchi , Kattak , and Nuristani styles .
The dance itself is believed to have originated from the Greek Pyrrhic dance , performed for the Greek goddess Athena .
Among the countless aforementioned variations , the Khattak style is thought to be the closest version to the Pyrrhic dance .
According to VirtualAfghans.com , the Khattak style is as follows :
... men performed this dance with their weapons in their hands .
A Khattak dancer performs with the zeal of a hero , displaying his physical fitness through body movements , while holding one , two , or even three swords at a time .
Each sword weighs about one - and - a - half kilograms .
The dance is a 5 step routine involving spins , with the swords crossed over their backs and elbows outward , or it can be performed with the swords out the sides and typical Attan half - spin in place while landing to a full spin .
Depending on the rhythm of that beat , this spin can be completely reversed in full synchronicity .
This dance is performed with the musician tuning the beat to the technique of the performers .
Today , the Attan dance is considered a traditional Afghan dance .
It was accepted into the fold of Afghani - Islamic society during the rule of the Mughal Dynasty , when the dance was modified into a Muslim dance soldiers used to get ' closer to God ' before try advanced on their missions .
A concept that no doubt is attributable to Afghanistan 's rich Sufi history .
Today , the dance is often performed at large Pashtun functions , like wedding celebrations .
The beauty of the Attan dance is that it is like a microcosm of the long - standing impact foreign invasions have on people and cultures .
No other significant remnants from Alexander the Great outwardly remains in Northwest Pakistan , and the Pashtun - dominated areas of Afghanistan , yet this dance , a very core ritual in Ancient Greek tradition , used to celebrate the very foundation of their society , lives on , and thrives not on those tiny Mediterranean islands , but rather , in some of the most culturally and religiously conservative communities in all the world .
Atop mountains , and among people that have had more foreigners attempt to invade over the past 2500 years than just about any other current - standing civilization .

Accused murderer Ray Clark was so desperate to hide his heinous handiwork that he allegedly broke the bones and mangled the body of a strangled
Yale grad student to fit it through a wall opening the size of a computer screen , The Post has learned .
“ He just crushed her in there .
She was like mush — she was so smashed up you could n’t recognize her , ” said a source , who gave The Post disturbing new details of Clark ’s moves after Annie Le ’s gruesome slaying .
Le ’s body , the source said , was found in a utility space in a bathroom wall near the basement lab where she had been working the day she vanished .
In his haste to cover his tracks after Le was killed , Clark accidentally tripped a fire alarm — possibly with his own or Le ’s employee swipe card , the source said .
Clark had used both his and Le ’s cards to access various areas of the lab after her murder — and those swipe cards can be used to sound a fire alert , according to the source .
“ He did n’t mean to set off the alarm , ” the source said .
Clark was seen on video after the building was evacuated , holding his head in his hands .
Before
Le was even reported missing , two rookie cops who talked to Clark after the fire alarm went off suspected he was up to no good , the source noted .
“ They knew something was off with the guy — he was nervous , ” said the source .
“ He was acting weird , he was ghost white .
His answers were n’t making any sense .
He was stuttering , and trying to stand in front of a chemistry tray with his arms crossed , trying to hide something . ”
Investigators have said Clark aroused suspicion when he was seen trying to clean the lab and hide equipment that later turned out to contain blood splatters .
According to the source , Clark was “ a control freak ” who insisted on lab cleanliness and “ had issues ” with the way Le kept her lab and her research mice .
“ She was n’t clean , and it made him mad . ”
Le was last seen entering her lab building at around 10 a.m. on Sept. 8 and was reported missing that night .
Her body was found Sept. 13 , the same day she was to wed Columbia grad student Jonathan Widawsky on Long Island .
A “ foul odor ” led investigators to her body , the source said .
The space where Le was found — 8 inches deep and covered by a metal panel “ the size of a computer screen ” — houses a vertical and a horizontal water pipe .
Her killer had to maneuver her body around the pipes , according to the source .
“ I ’ve been doing this a long time , and I ’ve never seen anything like that .
This guy ’s twisted . ”
( CNN ) -- A Florida jury has recommended the death penalty for a plumber who kidnapped , raped and murdered a police detective 's daughter .
Denise Lee 's frantic 911 call was the centerpiece of her killer 's trial .
Michael King , 38 , showed no reaction Friday afternoon as the jury 's 12 - 0 decision was announced in Sarasota .
Jurors deliberated for nearly three hours .
King was convicted a week ago of first - degree murder and related offenses in the January 17 , 2008 , death of Denise Lee , a 21 - year - old mother of two boys .
Nathan Lee and Sgt. Dave Goff , the victim 's husband and father , remained composed in court .
They had maintained a daily presence in the courtroom during a trial that included the heartbreaking tape of Denise Lee 's frantic 911 call on her captor 's cell phone .
Watch the jury recommend death »
In Florida , a jury 's recommendation for a death sentence is advisory .
King will be formally sentenced later .
Judges rarely overturn a jury 's unanimous decision .
Jurors Marcia Burns and Pat O'Quinn told reporters that defense testimony about King 's head injury from a sledding accident and his low IQ carried little weight in the jury room .
Denise Lee 's father and husband had hoped for the death penalty .
" I do n't think he should be able to live another day , " Nathan Lee said Friday as he awaited the verdict .
Lee and Goff told the jury that she was a bright young woman who put aside her career ambitions to marry her college sweetheart and raise their two boys , now 2 and 3 .
" She was everything we could wish for in a daughter and more , " Goff said .
Several jurors had tears in their eyes as Nathan Lee described his wife as a devoted mother who was nursing one son and potty - training another when a stranger abducted her from their home .

" I was so proud to call her my wife , " he said .
" Denise was the love of my life , my soul mate .
I knew after our first date that I had found the perfect girl . "
He added that their boys " know their beautiful , courageous mommy has gone to heaven and now is an angel . "
King 's siblings spoke of how a childhood sledding accident left him with a head injury that contributed to a lifetime of troubles .
One expert described the injury as a " divot " in his brain .
Experts testified that scans indicated that King 's brain was abnormally shaped , especially his frontal lobe : the center for logic , planning and reason .
His IQ was described as about 76 , in the low range .
A person with an IQ of 70 is considered to be mentally retarded , according to testimony .
King 's brother , Greg , testified that the defendant was 6 when he crashed head - first into a post while being pulled on a sled by a snowmobile .
" I felt bad for him , " Greg King said .
" I felt responsible , but I was n't . "
As a child , Michael King would get a faraway look in his eyes , witnesses said .
Once , he fired his BB gun at witches he said he saw in the trees .
Another time , he chased family members around the house with a running chainsaw .
His eyes were " bugging out , " his brother testified .
King also complained of headaches and hearing " a buzzing sound " in his head , Greg King told the jury .
King seemed to be deteriorating mentally in late 2007 , according to testimony .
He faced foreclosure , was considering filing for bankruptcy and broke up with a girlfriend on Thanksgiving Day .
The ex-girlfriend , Jennifer Robb , testified that he sat on the bed staring into space and unable to dress himself .
" He acted as if he were somewhere else , " she said .
But she said she never knew him to be violent .
According to testimony , Lee was taken from her home during the afternoon , driven to King 's home , sexually assaulted and then shot in the head and buried in a ditch .
During the trial , Lee 's voice filled the courtroom as her desperate 911 call was played to the jury .
Listen to the heartbreaking 911 call »
A 911 operator repeatedly said " Hello , " and Lee was heard pleading with her captor : " I 'm sorry .
I just want to see my family .
... I just want to see my family again .
Please . ...
Oh , please , I just want to see my family again .
Let me go . "
Eventually , Lee managed to say , " My name is Denise .
I 'm married to a beautiful husband , and I just want to see my kids again .
...
Please , God , please protect me . "
Lee 's heart - shaped ring , a gift from her husband , was found in King 's car , and hair matching hers was found on duct tape at King 's house .
According to testimony and court records ,
Lee fought frantically for her life , banging on the windows of King 's green Camaro , screaming for help and begging one witness , " Call the cops . "
Several people reported seeing something suspicious and called 911 .
But authorities did n't find Lee in time , and allegations that dispatchers mishandled the calls have led to criticism of the local 911 system .
The 911 communications breakdown was blamed on a shift change , and two dispatchers were suspended , according to the St. Petersburg Times .
Lee 's husband has launched a foundation bearing her name that works toward 911 reform .
He plans to file a lawsuit this month , a family spokesman said .

During my entire working life at printer manufacturer
Oce , I have been involved in writing dedicated code ( firmware ) for rather deviating hardware processing architectures .
For this activity I learned to appreciate APL ( reported on this at APL87 ) and later J as development environment / language and I want to share this with the J - community .
The problems associated with firmware development are mainly caused by long and elaborate development cycles :
poor understanding of hardware
poor software developent environment ( as supplied by processor manufacturer )
hodgepot of third party software development tooling ( Model Based Design / UML , Matlab , Simulink )
I have succesfully used J as a specification language throughout the whole integral firmware development process : starting from the first familiarisation of problem as well as the intended hardware architecture till code generation and maintenance .
J is useful for this activity because it :
is interactive and offers executability ( direct feedback ) during the whole development process ,
and offers executability ( direct feedback ) during the whole development process , is expressive enough to allow for a single language supporting multiple roles ( specification easily permits extensions to multicore architectures )
enough to allow for a single language supporting multiple roles ( specification easily permits extensions to multicore architectures ) allows for incremental design , enabling further development in small steps .
The methodology of firmware development is covered in my PhD thesis .
Although the work has been conducted in J , my supervisor advised me to use a better known functional language , Haskell , to illustrate the various examples .
I think if one has the objective to interest non-J users then Haskell might attract more readers .
In this way we could increase the attention on J. Below I have included some typical examples during a few phases in developing firmware .
I have included a few modelling examples , composed as a 3 column table .
The examples are taken from various phases and are organised in rows .
The columns contain subsequently a mathematical or textual description , the Haskell version , and the J version .
I have attached 2 tables ( incomplete and not included in the thesis ) from which we could select the examples : ,
For many people ( and yes I ’m jumping to conclusions and making sweeping generalizations here )
“ No one should die because they ca n’t afford health care ” is the weasel way of saying “ I want someone else to pay for it ” without sounding like a panhandler .
So , take what follows with a grain of salt , OK ?
On that note , someone ’s Facebook status said :
No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick .
If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day .
No one should die just because they were born in sub-Saharan Africa , either .
But they do .
Does n’t make it fair , but it happens .
For every “ poor ” or underprivileged Westerner complaining about their lack of “ health care ” ( NB : even the poorest Americans have access to better health care than , I would venture to guess , 85 % of the earth ’s population has ever had ) , there are a million people living on $ 1 and a cup of rice each day — so cry me a fucking river .
Every one of us will die at the crossroads of some particular circumstances , time , and place .
Some of us die in our sleep .
Some of us are merely in “ the wrong place at the wrong time . ”
Some of us will die because the technology to cure what ails us has not yet been invented .
Some of us will die because we made poor choices that presently impact our ability to care for ourselves .
And some of us will die unfortunately through no direct fault of our own , because we ca n’t afford to pay for the technology that does exist .
To lament the fact that some people die under seemingly inopportune circumstances is folly ; it ignores the lion ’s share of the equation .
Financial circumstances are a scapegoat , because at nearly any time and place where the individual is n’t DOA , a change in financial circumstances might forestall death for a few hours , days , weeks , or months .
You ’ll get no arguments from me , if you say that “ health care is too expensive ” : blame the AMA cartel , the FDA , blame “ Big Insurance ” , etc . But National Healthcare is healthcare fascism , the insurers want guaranteed profits , guaranteed customers for life , and Uncle Sam to pay the bills .
They want to sell you your own welfare .
You ’ll get no arguments from me , if you say that “ the system ” needs to be reformed : specifically it needs to not be a system at all .
People are n’t permitted under the law to care for themselves or to arrange for the care of others .
Or because the consumer is not the customer , and the customer enjoys certain tax privileges that the consumer does not , etc .
Or because people have been conditioned to believe that “ insurance ” should pay for an annual check - up and dental exams and all sorts of other routine maintenance instead of just providing for accidents and serious illnesses .
The problem is that health care , medicine , long term care , etc. , is damned expensive .
Government is the problem in health care , which keeps it unaffordable .
Asking or forcing others to pay the costs which you ca n’t afford will do nothing to actually solve that problem , it just shifts the burden , fucking up someone else ’s life circumstances , exacerbating the problem for the future .

The Conservatives used the debate to highlight the case of Gary McKinnon A Briton fighting extradition to the US for hacking into top - secret computers claims he was morally justified in breaking the law .
Gary McKinnon , 43 , from Wood Green , north London , admits hacking into 97 US government computers , including Nasa 's and Pentagon's , during 2001 and 2002 .
He told the BBC he was on a " moral crusade " to prove US intelligence had found an alien craft run on clean fuel .
Results of judicial reviews into Mr McKinnon 's case are due on Friday .
They focus on whether Mr McKinnon should have been allowed to face trial in the UK and whether the decision to extradite him should have been reconsidered in light of his diagnosis as having Asperger 's Syndrome last year .
His lawyers say he is " eccentric " rather than malicious and that he should be tried on lesser charges in the UK to protect his mental health .
It is actually a completely unbalanced extradition treaty
Gary McKinnon Mr McKinnon is accused of hacking into the computers with the intention of intimidating the US government .
His legal team fear he could be treated as a terrorist and face up to 70 years in jail .
The US government says his actions caused damage costing $ 800,000 ( £ 500,000 ) at a time of heightened security in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks .
Mr McKinnon told BBC Radio 5 live 's Victoria Derbyshire show : " I 'm not blind to criminality but I was on a moral crusade at the time .
" There was good evidence to show that certain secretive parts of the American government intelligence agencies did have access to crashed extra terrestrial technology which could ... save us as a form of free , clean , pollution - free energy .
" I thought if someone was holding on to that , that was actually unconstitutional under American law . "
' Two - way street '
Mr McKinnon also criticised arrangements between the two countries that meant the US only had to prove " reasonable suspicion " to force extradition of a British citizen .
To extradite an American from the US , the British must prove " probable cause " .
" It is actually a completely unbalanced extradition treaty .
It should be a two - way street , " said Mr McKinnon .
Earlier this month , the Conservatives failed in a bid to force a review of the law when their Commons motion was defeated by 54 votes .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson told them the 2003 treaty had simplified extradition procedures while safeguarding defendants ' rights .
The burden of evidence required on each side is " essentially " the same , he added .

A Year After the Crunch Are Britain 's Scrooges Slowing Recovery ?
Normally spendthrift Britons are cutting back on shopping and upping their savings , an austerity that may be harming the economic turnaround
Von Mark Scott
Spawning a thread in non-functional languages is considered a very low - level primitive .
Often spawn or CreateThread takes a function pointer and an untyped ( void ) pointer to “ data ” .
The newly created thread will execute the function , passing it the untyped pointer , and it ’s up to the function to cast the data into something more palatable .
This is indeed the lowest of the lowest .
It ’s the stinky gutters of programming .
Is n’t it much nicer to create a Thread or a Runnable object and let the ugly casting be done under the covers ?
But , as I argued before , the Thread object does n’t really buy you much in terms of the most important safety issue : the avoidance of data races .
So we can have a Thread object instead of a void pointer , and a run method that understands the format of the Thread object ( or Runnable , take your pick ) .
But because the Thread / Runnable object has reference semantics , we still end up inadvertently sharing data between threads .
Unless the programmer consciously avoids or synchronizes shared access , he or she is left exposed to the most vile concurrency bugs–by default !
As they say , Cooks cover their mistakes with sauces ; doctors , with six feet of dirt ; language designers , with objects .
Requirements
But enough ranting !
I have the opportunity to design the spawn function for D and I do n’t want to do any more cover - ups beyond hiding the ugly systems ’
APIs .
Here are my design requirements :
spawn should take an arbitrary function as the main argument .
It should refuse ( at compile time ) delegates or closures , which would introduce back - door sharing .
( This might be relaxed later as we gain experience in controlling the sharing . )
should take an arbitrary function as the main argument .
It should refuse ( at compile time ) delegates or closures , which would introduce back - door sharing .
( This might be relaxed later as we gain experience in controlling the sharing . )
It should take a variable number of arguments of the types compatible with those of the function parameters .
It should detect type mismatches at compile time .
It should refuse the types of arguments that are prone to introducing data races .
For now , I ’ll allow only value types , immutable types , and explicitly shared types ( shared is a type modifier in D ) .
I wish I could use the more precise race - free type system that I ’ve been describing in my previous posts , but since I ca n’t get it into D2 , there ’s still a little bit of “ programmer beware ” in this implementation .
These requirement seem like a tall order for any language other than D. I would n’t say it ’s a piece of cake in D , but it ’s well within the reach of a moderately experienced programmer .
Unit Tests
Let me start by writing a little use case for my design ( Oh , the joys of extreme programming ! ) :
S s = { 3.14 } ; Tid tid = spawn ( &thrFun , 2 , s , " hello " ) ; tid.join ;
Here ’s the definition of the function , thrFun :
void thr Fun( int i , S s , string str ) { writeln ( " thread function called with : " , i , " , " , s.fl , " and " , str ) ; }
Its parameter types fulfill the restrictions I listed above .
The int is a value and so is S ( structs are value types in D , unless they contain references ) :
struct S { float fl ; }
Interestingly , the string is okay too , because its reference part is immutable .
In D , a string is defined as an array of immutable characters , immutable ( char ) [ ] .
Besides positive tests , the even more important cases are negative .
For instance , I do n’t want spawn to accept a function that takes an Object as argument .
Objects are reference types and ( if not declared shared ) can sneak in unprotected sharing .
How do you build unit tests whose compilation should fail ?
Well , D has a trick for that ( ignore the ugly syntax ) :
void fo( Object o ) {} assert ( ! __traits ( compiles , ( Object o ) { return spawn ( & fo , o ) ; } ) ) ;
This code asserts that the function literal ( a lambda ) ,
( Object o ) { return spawn ( & fo , o ) ; }
does not compile with the thread function fo .
Now that ’s one useful construct worth remembering !
Implementation
Without further ado , I present you with the implementation of spawn that passes all the above tests ( and more ) :
Tid spawn ( T... ) ( void function ( T ) fp , T args ) if ( isLocalMsgTypes ! ( T ) ) { return core.thread.spawn ( ( ) { fp( args ) ; } ) ; }
This attractively terse code uses quite a handful of D features , so let me first read it out loud for kicks :
spawn is a function template returning the Tid ( Thread ID ) structure .
Tid is a reference - counted handle , see my previous blog .
is a function template returning the ( Thread ID ) structure .
is a reference - counted handle , see my previous blog .
It is parameterized by a type tuple T… .
.
It takes the following parameters : a pointer to a function , fp , taking arguments of the types specified by the tuple T… a variable number of parameters , args , of types T… .
The type tuple T… must obey the predicate isLocalMsgTypes , which is defined elsewhere .
must obey the predicate , which is defined elsewhere .
The implementation of spawn calls the ( in general , unsafe ) function core.
thread .
spawn ( defined in the module core. thread ) with the following closure ( nested function ) : ( ) { fp( args ) ; } which captures local variables , args .
As you may guess , the newly spawned thread runs the closure , so it has access to captured args from the original thread .
In general , that ’s a recipe for a data race .
What saves the day is the predicate isLocalMsgTypes , which defines what types are safe to pass as inter - thread messages .
Note the important point : there should be no difference between the constraints imposed on the types of parameters passed to spawn and the types of messages that can be sent to a thread .
You can think of spawn parameters as initial messages sent to a nascent thread .
As I said before , message types include value types , immutable types and shared types ( no support for unique types yet ) .
Useful D features
Let me explain some of D novelties I used in the definition of spawn .
A function with two sets of parenthesized parameters is automatically a template –the first set are template parameters , the second , runtime parameters .
- Tuples
Type tuples , like T… , represent arbitrary lists of types .
Similar constructs have also been introduced in C++0x , presumably under pressure from Boost , to replace the unmanageably complex type lists .
What are the things that you can do with a type - tuple in D ?
You can retrieve its length ( T.length ) , access its elements by index , or slice it ; all at compile time .
You can also define a variable - argument - list function , like spawn and use one symbol for a whole list of arguments , as in T args :
Tid spawn ( T... ) ( void function ( T ) fp , T args )
Now let ’s go back to my test :
Tid tid = spawn ( &f , 2 , s , " hello " ) ;
I spawn a thread to execute a function of three arguments , void f( int i , S s , string str ) .
The spawn template is instantiated with a type tuple ( int , S , string ) .
At compile time , this tuple is successfully tested by the predicate isLocalMsgTypes .
The actual arguments to spawn , besides the pointer to function , are ( 2 , s , “ hello ” ) , which indeed are of correct types .
They appear inside spawn under the collective name , args .
They are then used as a collective argument to fp inside the closure , ( ) { fp( args ) ; } .
- Closures
The closure captures the arguments to spawn .
It is then passed to the internal function ( not a template anymore ) ,
core.thread.spawn( void delegate ( ) dlg )
When the new thread is created , it calls the closure dlg , which calls fp with the captured arguments .
At that point , the value arguments , i and s are copied , along with the shallow part of the string , str .
The deep part of the string , the buffer , is not copied–and for a good reason too– it is immutable , so it can safely be read concurrently .
At that point , the thread function is free to use those arguments without worrying about races .
- Restricted Templates
The if statement before the body of a template is D’s response to C++0x DOA concepts ( yes , after years of design discussions , concepts were finally killed with extreme prejudice ) .
if ( isLocalMsgTypes ! ( T ) )
The if is used to create “ restricted templates ” .
It contains a logical compile - time expression that is checked before the template is instantiated .
If the expression is false , the template does n’t match and you get a compile error .
Notice that template restrictions not only produce better error messages , but can also impose restrictions that are otherwise impossible or very hard to enforce .
Without the restriction , spawn could be called with an unsuitable type , e.g. an Object not declared as shared and the compiler would n’t even blink .
( I will talk about template restrictions and templates in general in a future blog . )
– Message Types
Besides values , we may also pass to spawn objects that are declared as immutable or shared ( in fact , we may pass them inside values as well ) .
In D , shared objects are supposed to provide their own synchronization –their methods must either be synchronized or lock free .
An example of a shared object that you ’d want to pass to spawn is a message queue–to be shared between the parent thread and the spawned thread .
You might remember that my race - free type system proposal included unique types , which would be great for message passing , and consequently as arguments to spawn ( there is a uniqueness proposal for Scala , and there ’s the Kilim message - passing system for Java based on unique types ) .
Unfortunately , unique types wo n’t be available in D2 .
Instead some kind of specialized Unique library classes might be defined for that purpose .
Conclusion
The D programming language has two faces .
On the one hand , it ’s easy to use even for a beginner .
On the other hand , it provides enough expressive power to allow for the creation of sophisticated and safe libraries .
What I tried to accomplish in this post is to give a peek at D from the perspective of a library writer .
In particular I described mechanisms that help make the concurrency library safer to use .
This is still work in progress , so do n’t expect to see it in the current releases of D2 .
A former legislative aide is accused of sexually propositioning a 15 - year - old Harrisburg boy through Internet chats , including discussions about dressing up in animal costumes and engaging in various sex acts with the boy , state Attorney General Tom Corbett announced today .
Alan David Berlin , 40 , recently a legislative aide to state Sen.
Jane Clare Orie , R - Allegheny , used the Internet screen name , " alan_panda_bear , " to chat with the boy in April and May , Corbett said .
At one point during the chats , Berlin proposed traveling to the boy 's home and having sex with him in the backyard while his parents were sleeping , Corbett said .
Berlin also requested nude photos of the boy and offered to get a hotel room if he could take pictures of the boy and another adult having sex , according to court papers .
The boy 's parents became concerned after discovering sexually graphic messages on their son's computer and contacted the Attorney General 's Child Predator Unit , which began an investigation Tuesday , Corbett said .
Berlin was arrested Thursday in Carlisle by agents from the Child Predator Unit , who were assisted by officers from the Carlisle and North Middleton Township police departments .
He has been suspended without pay and benefits indefinitely , Orie 's chief counsel , Mike Sarfert , said .
Berlin was charged with unlawful contact with a minor , criminal attempted sexual exploitation of children , criminal solicitation to commit sexual abuse of children and criminal use of a computer .
He was arraigned before District Judge George A. Zozos and taken to Dauphin County Prison in lieu of $ 250,000 bail .
A preliminary hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday before District Judge William C. Wenner .
We constantly are seeing polling down from the major news services that follow President Obama 's approval ratings and it is an important stat to keep track of , but can you tell me what the media is not covering ?
How low the Republicans have been polling ever since they became the party of " Waterloo . "
The Democratic leaders do have terrible polling numbers , Nancy Pelosi has a 34 % approval rating in DKOS 's new poll and Harry Reid has a 31 % approval rating , but let 's take a look at the Republican leadership , shall we ?
Mitch McConnell is polling at an 18 % approval rating .
That 's eighteen percent .
John Boehner is polling at 12 % approval rating .
Just think about that one .
And it does n't take much to make him cry .
Mitch and Boehner are viewed less favorably than Dick Cheney was during the dark days of the Bush administration .
Why do n't we hear about that on teevee ?
The overall approval ratings of Congressional Republicans is 17 % as a party !
The Dems are taking their lumps over this chaotic time , but nowhere near the kinds of wounds the GOP are suffering .
The media make it appear that all these teabaggers are rallying around the RNC and the country just loves the Beltway elites ' favorite party , but that 's not true at all .
Let 's see if we hear any of this on the Sunday talk Shows .
But I wo n't hold my breath .
Those who carry the faulty gene have a very high risk of bowel cancer
One of the earliest chemotherapy drugs appears to work against a genetic fault that can trigger bowel and other cancers , UK researchers say .
In laboratory tests methotrexate , first administered in the 1940s , was found to destroy cells containing the damaged MSH2 gene .
This raises the hope of targeted treatments for those whose cancer is driven by the faulty gene .
Patient trials have already begun , EMBO Molecular Medicine reports .
The genetic condition HNPCC leaves people with a propensity to develop certain forms of cancer : some 90 % of men and 70 % of women will have developed bowel cancer by the time they reach 70 .
METHOTREXATE
Methotrexate heralded in the modern era of chemotherapy drugs
In the 1940s , doctors reported remarkable results when treating children who were very ill with leukaemia
It works by stopping cancer cells making and repairing DNA and therefore growing and multiplying Subsequently used as part of chemotherapy regime for many cancers , including breast , bladder and bone
Over the years as medicine has developed other drugs have been preferred Still used for leukaemia and also now found to be effective for other conditions , such as Crohn 's disease and psoriasis
This accounts for about 5 % of all bowel cancer cases , and the condition also contributes to tumours of the stomach , womb , ovaries and kidneys .
About 40 % of people with HNPCC carry a faulty MSH2 gene .
The gene usually plays a vital role in repairing DNA damage , but if it is damaged , mistakes accumulate in the cells and increase the risk of a cancer developing .
People who develop bowel cancer as a result may have more than one tumour , making the condition harder to treat .
Years after it was first used in the US , methotrexate is still commonly used in the treatment of leukaemia .
It works by stopping cancer cells growing and multiplying , but is not normally deployed against solid tumours as newer , better drugs have been developed .
" What 's exciting about methotrexate is that it selectively destroys the cells lacking the MSH2 function .
This indicates that it may make an excellent treatment for patients with the genetic alteration , " said Professor Alan Ashworth , who led the study at the Institute of Cancer Research .
Tailored treatment Dr Lesley Walker of Cancer Research UK , which funded the research , said : " In the past , many treatments were developed which indiscriminately kill dividing cells .
With improved scientific understanding , we are starting to be able to offer targeted therapies that are selective for the genetic faults in cancer .
" It 's really fascinating that our scientists have discovered that an old - fashioned drug of this type shows new promise for this very specific group of patients . "
Independent experts welcomed the findings .
" This is good news from one of our oldest chemotherapy drugs .
It wo n't be for everyone , but it does hold out hope of a tailored treatment for those affected - a form of personalised chemotherapy , " said Professor Will Steward , of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer .
Rob Glynne - Jones , chief medical advisor at Bowel Cancer UK , said : " The discovery that the faulty MSH2 gene has been found to be a specific target for Methotrexate is a really exciting development .
" It will probably only be relevant to a small proportion of patients who have bowel cancer , as HNPCC is only responsible for about 5 % of bowel cancer cases .
However , this is another positive step in using molecular biology and genetics to individualise a patient 's treatment . "

Media , Congress yawn ...
Brad Friedman Byon
8/17/2009 , 10:05 am PT
RAW STORY 's coverage of the news , and the release of the video demonstration of how to hack a Sequoia AVC Advantage electronic voting machine , began this way last week :
team of computer scientists at University of California , San Diego , the University of Michigan and Princeton University announced a new way to electronically steal votes Monday .
" We wanted to find if a real criminal could do this , starting from scratch , with no access to source code or other closely guarded technical information , " the announcer begins .
" We faced several challenges : getting a voting machine , figuring out how it works , discovering a weakness , overcoming the machine 's security features and constructing attack software . "
" In the end we found that it is possible to undetectably change votes and that such an attack takes a lot less time and money than one might expect , " the announcer said .
A Princeton professor was able to acquire five voting machines for just $ 82 that had been resold on a government surplus website .
The acquired machines were originally sold by Sequoia Voting Systems .
Hacks of our electronic voting systems used to be big news .
Now though , it 's been done so many times , and is apparently so simple to do , that the news hardly registers in the corporate mainstream media ( if it ever did in the first place ) .
Yet , almost nothing has been done about virtually any of it to date .
We reported on the Princeton professor , Andrew Appel , acquiring the five Sequoia AVC machines two and a half years ago , that he was able to pick the lock " in seven seconds " , and change the chips inside to do anything he might want the machine to do , including change votes after the close of polls on Election Day .
The five machines that Appel purchased for $ 82 on the Internet were purchased by New Jersey just a few years earlier for $ 10,000 a piece .
The state still uses the same hackable , 100 % unverifiable voting machines , despite numerous failures during actual elections .
At the time of Appel 's purchase , Sequoia Voting System had been touting their " tamperproof products , including ... the AVC Advantage , " which , they said , " are sought after from coast to coast for their accuracy and reliability . " ...
The video tape demonstration of the new hack ( posted below ) , avers that the chip swap used in the hack can be done while the voting machine is left unattended , which is , as the video notes , a " common practice in many polling places . "
It certainly is .
( See Sequoia voting machines left unattended in two different Riverside County polling locations in 2006 , at right . )
While the hack could be accomplished , as suggested by the scientists , by an outsider , an insider , such as an election official , voting machine company employee , or a poll worker who takes the voting machine home in the days prior to the election ( a common practice , which has come to be known as a voting machine " sleepover " ) proves the greatest threat to such systems .
As acknowledged by virtually all computer scientists and security experts , and even confirmed by the highly compromised , GOP - operative - created Baker / Carter National Election Reform Commission years ago , the greatest threat to such systems comes from insiders .
As even the phony Baker / Carter commission noted : " There is no reason to trust insiders in the election industry any more than in other industries . "
Thus , there is almost nothing that can be done to protect against such exploits .
But whoever accomplishes this particular hack , the UC San Diego scientists note , the exploit leaves no trace behind and is therefore unlikely to ever be discovered .
In the UC San Diego video demonstration , 3 votes are seen being cast for George Washington during a mock election .
But , " after the polls closed , the attacker 's invisible software shifts votes . "
Instead of Washington , the electronic Sequoia voting machine prints out the winner as Benedict Arnold by a 2 to 1 vote margin .
No known electronic voting system , the scientists now argue , is safe .
" We demonstrated practical attacks against a specific computer voting machine , the AVC Advantage , but the implications are broader , " they note in the video .
" Computer security features may not stand the test of time .
Providing a lasting safeguard requires a system that voters can verify , such as paper ballots . "
They are correct , of course , and no " Luddites " either , as computer scientists and security experts .
Though , it should be noted , that while paper ballots --- by definition , " verified " by the voter when they actually fill them in by hand --- are needed , unless they are counted publicly , those too can be easily exploited without detection .
[ Ed Note : I 'll have more on that point shortly , in an article and op / ed I recently wrote for the Commonweal Institute , where I am a Fellow . - BF ]
Congressman Rush Holt ( D - NJ ) 's " Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act " ( H.R. 2894 ) legislation , which we 've analyzed in detail , is now working its way through the U.S.
House as the leading piece of voting system reform in either chamber .
While eventually banning the type of electronic voting systems used in the UC San Diego team 's experiment , it would allow them for continued use in the next two federal election cycles , including the 2012 Presidential race .
It would then allow for the tabulation of paper ballots by similarly hackable optical - scan systems forever .
Sequoia Voting Systems hackable voting machines are used in fifteen states , including New Jersey ( Rush Holt 's home state ) , Missouri , Virginia and the entire state of Nevada , as well as the District of Columbia .
The team that documented this latest hack includes several members of the Princeton team who hacked Diebold 's AccuVote touch - screen system in 2006 after we supplied them with the voting machine , as given to us by a Diebold insider .
Though it made big quite a splash at the time --- even live on Fox " News " --- when , as with the latest hack , Benedict Arnold was able to defeat George Washington after eye - witnesses watched all the votes being cast in favor of Washington , the same , ironically named Diebold AccuVotes are still in use today .
Just like the Sequoia systems .
Professor Ed Felten , one of the members of the original Princeton team , who also worked on the San Diego study , was threatened with a lawsuit , along with Appel , by Sequoia Voting Systems last year .
They would be sued , Sequoia informed them , if they carried out an independent inspection of the AVC Advantage , after election officials in NJ asked them to do so following the revelation that the machines had reported incorrect vote totals during the Super Tuesday primary in 2008 .
( The same machines also failed to boot up at all in several locations on the morning of the primary , causing NJ Gov. John Corzine --- and an untold number of other voters --- to be delayed for at least 45 minutes while officials tried to get the systems to boot in Hoboken . )
Though Sequoia never sued the Princeton scientists , as they 'd threatened , an investigative report by The BRAD BLOG would document , ironically enough , that Sequoia does n't even own the intellectual property rights to the voting machines bearing their name .
Rather , the IP rights are owned by once ( and still ? ) parent company Smartmatic , a Venezuelan firm tied to Hugo Chavez , which Sequoia claimed to have divested from once federal officials from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) began questioning the propriety of foreign ownership in a company which supplies , services and programs electronic voting systems in the U.S. .
They have been lying to public officials about that point for years .
Despite our report documenting the continuing direct ties between Sequoia and Smartmatic --- even after the company had falsely claimed to have severed their relationship entirely --- neither the corporate media , nor the U.S. government has re-opened their investigation into the matter to our knowledge .
And Sequoia voting machines continue to be used across the country , in election after election , despite failure after failure , and hack after hack .

And so , as the May 5 meeting approached , we prepared for another one of the highly scripted , well - protected events that are supposed to make up the " health care debate " using standard tools of advocacy .
We organized call - in days and faxes to the members of the committee requesting the presence of one single - payer advocate at the table of 15 .
Despite thousands of calls and faxes , the only reply — received on the day before the event — was , " Sorry , but no more invitations will be issued . "
We knew that this could n’t be correct .
We had heard Sen .
Baucus say on that very same day that " all options were on the table . "
And so , the next day , we donned our suits and traveled to Washington .
We had many knowledgeable single - payer advocates in our group .
And as the meeting started , one of us , Mr. Russell Mokhiber , stood up to say that we were here and we were ready to take a seat .
And he was promptly removed from the room .
In that moment , it all became so clear .
We could write letters , phone staffers , and fax until the machines fell apart , but we would never get our seat at the table .
The senators understand that most people want a national health system and that an improved Medicare for All would include everybody and provide better health care at a lower cost .
These facts mean nothing to most of them because they respond to only one standard tool of advocacy : money , and lots of it .
The people seated at the table represented the corporate interests : private health insurers and big business and those who support their agenda .
The people whose voices were heard all represented organizations which pay huge sums of money to political campaigns .
These interests profit greatly from the current health care industry and do not want changes that will hurt their large , personal pocketbooks .
And so , we have entered a new phase in the movement for health care as a human right : acts of civil disobedience .
It is time to directly challenge corporate interests .
History has shown that in order to gain human rights , we must be willing to speak out and risk arrest .
We must engage in actions that expose corporate fraud and corruption .
We must make our presence known .
And that is why the eight of us , knowledgeable health care advocates and providers , most of us parents , some of us grandparents , spoke out one - by - one at the Senate Finance Committee .
And it is why we will continue to speak out and encourage others to do the same .
Our voices must be strong enough to drown out the influence of corporate dollars .
Health care must become the civil rights movement of this decade .
The opportunity is here .
And we can create a single - payer national health care system .
Yes , we can .

Written by Daniel Jos. Leary
Feudal Japan , medieval Europe , the Roman republic and 18th century America and the colonies .
No band has ever taken in so many countries – or indeed eras – during a world tour , yet these are only a handful of some of the places Creative Assembly has conquered since the Total War series rumbled onto the battlefield almost a decade ago .
Now the developer is declaring war once again and this time it 's French military leader Napoleon leading the charge .
Set in the final years of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th , this latest instalment in the critically acclaimed strategy series will explore the events leading to Napoleon 's rise to power through - and beyond , if you play it right – to his eventual defeat at the battle of Waterloo .
Napoleon Total
War will build on the engine and framework of Empire Total War , but will add a whole host of new features and extra touches that the developers did n't have time to include in the first game .
Kieran Brigden , Communications Manager at Creative Assembly , explains : " The way that Total War development works is we do a kind of evolution - revolution cycle .
We create revolutionary technology for one title - in this case Empire , which had a brand new engine written from the ground up - and all new AI .
Then , for the next game , we take that technology and evolve it - in this case with Napoleon .
We 've taken everything we 've achieved with Empire and Empire 's engine and just pushed it to the limit .
Napoleon is essentially the culmination of what we wanted to do with Empire , given the time to take it further .
" The Napoleonic period was picked because it ticked all the right boxes for the Creative Assembly team , who have a checklist of what exactly must be going on in a time period for it to turn up in a Total War game .
One such criteria is that there must be a set of warring factions , any of which could have potentially risen to be the dominant power , so that gamers can go ahead and see what happens when they rewrite history .
" If you take post - revolutionary France , it was both strong ideologically and incredibly weak , " says Brigden .
" The revolution had bankrupted the country .
There were a lot of other powers in Europe vying for control , there was the old Austrian Empire which was cutting into French territory in the south , obviously the British empire which was incredibly well established , with the British navy ruling the seas .
Not to mention the Russians and Prussians and everyone else ...
" The team also decided that the famous Frenchman deserved to be the focus of a title , for many reasons .
" What 's really interesting about Napoleon and his story is that he took control of a nation , literally by himself , as one man , and led it to be the greatest and the most powerful nation in Europe , " Brigden enthuses .
" The thing was that he fought a war that was considered at the time to be not gentlemanly .
People were like , ' this is n't how it 's done , you go cavalry first , infantry second , then artillery , then a bit more cavalry ...' , but Napoleon did n't care about any of that , he just fought to win .
He did n't fight to play the grand game , so towards the beginning , when he fought the first Dukes of Europe , he came with this really unorthodox mix of tactics and it set him apart from the gentlemen at the table .
He was often regarded as a bit of a brigand and a down at heel - the arrogant little Frenchman .
" Like previous instalments , Napoleon will be a mix of turn - based and real - time strategy , with gamers first of all taking time to plan their strategy down to the tiniest detail before switching to the midst of the battlefield , commanding troops in real - time as they fight on your orders .
Infantry , cavalry and ships will all be unique to the instalment and altogether there will be a total of 322 new units to command .
On the subject of hard stats , up to a maximum of 10,000 men will appear on screen at one time , depending on the settings and PC specs , although this time round Creative Assembly will be adding more variety in the way the men look , with the aim being to eliminate the ' clone army ' problem .
Indeed , the game will mix and match different body parts to make soldiers look individual and unique , with 64 different faces on offer even on the very lowest settings .
Additionally , artists have been adding extra touches to the light and smoke effects on screen .
According to Kieran , " Napoleon looks 50,000 times better than Empire when it comes to the individual units and their animations and the way they act on the battlefield .
We 're doing a huge amount with all the particle effects , polishing up everything that comes with the smoke and physics systems .
All of that stuff sounds cosmetic , but when you put it together , you get a very , very different game experience .
For example , we 've now got to the point where the smoke from all the rifle muzzle flashes hangs in the air and then drifts across the battlefield .
That affects your visibility and your guys ' ability to shoot and reload , and it 's affecting your view as a commander on the battlefield .
The horses will also kick up dust and mud when they charge in , which will also affect visibility .
"
The hugely popular naval battles will return again in Napoleon , although some may question their inclusion .
" Although Napoleon is not famous for his naval engagements or his naval superiority , that 's not to say that the player cannot reverse that and play it their own way , " explains Brigden .
It 's possible if you are a good tactician to beat the British on the high seas , and Napoleon famously said , ' Give me control of the channel for six hours and I will have Britain in less than a week ! ' , but of course the British Navy never let him do it .
" The good news is that naval combat system has been refined after criticisms aimed at the mechanics in Empire , and there will be new attributes and abilities .
One of these is the ability to repair ships during combat .
" What will happen is you will see all the hands leaving their posts at the cannons and the sails and the masts and frantically trying to patch up holes in the hull , and all the while the ship 's taking water , " explains Brigden .
Obviously the ship can't do anything at that point and you 're going to have to protect it , but at least it wo n't sink straight away - you will be able to stay in the fight that little bit longer .
"
The role of Generals on the battlefield will also be different ; this time round they 'll play a far bigger part tactically in battle .
Generals will have an aura effect , which means that simply by sending them into areas where there is low morale , soldiers will perk up and recover the will to fight .
" Napoleon naturally plays a huge part in the game and he is a battlefield general -- you will see him and use him on the actual battlefield when playing as France , " says Brigden .
" Having him on the battlefield is a very important thing because Empire treated generals almost as slightly cowardly aristocrats who would sit at the back of a battle and say ' off you go lads ! ' and they 'd call victory or defeat without ever disturbing their teacups .
Napoleon changed that , he went back to the model of a general leading his men from the front .
Sure , later on when he got a bit fatter and a bit less involved , he started doing the whole tactician thing and standing at the back , but certainly early on he was literally at the front of the charges .
He was a warrior king .
As far as the game goes , leading a charge with him is probably still a bad idea because you do n't want him exposed to artillery and grape shot and having him massacred , but at the same time he 'll have a much greater use on the battlefield as a tactical object . "
Additionally , you 'll now also get to select your Generals from a list and each will have unique attributes - while some will be stalwart defenders , others will be fiercely offensive , and others ...
Well , just wo n't be very much good at all .
AVIATION has long been blamed for its share of anthropogenic global warming .
Indeed , some travellers now ask themselves whether their flight is strictly necessary and , if they decide it is , salve their consciences by paying for the planting of trees .
These , so they hope , will absorb the equivalent of their sinful emissions .
But you , dear reader , are indulging right now in activity that is equally as polluting as air travel : using a computer .
According to a report published by the Climate Group , a think - tank based in London , computers , printers , mobile phones and the widgets that accompany them account for the emission of 830 m tonnes of carbon dioxide around the world in 2007 .
That is about 2 % of the estimated total of emissions from human activity .
And that is the same as the aviation industry 's contribution .
According to the report , about a quarter of the emissions in question are generated by the manufacture of computers and so forth .
The rest come from their use .
EPA
Down on the server farm
The same report estimates that the spread of computers will increase these associated emissions by about 6 % a year until 2020 , when one person in three will own a personal computer , half will have a mobile phone and one household in 20 will have a broadband internet connection .
Yet computing can also be used to tackle climate change .
For example , domestic consumption could be cut by the large - scale employment of smart meters in houses and flats .
Households are the biggest users of electricity after manufacturing and transport .
In Britain , they accounted for 29 % of consumption in 2004 , according to a government report .
Small and medium - sized businesses , meanwhile , could save electricity by switching to distributed computing , rather than running their own servers .
The delivery of computer services over the internet , from vast warehouses of shared machines , enables firms to hand over the running of their e-mail , customer databases and accounting systems to someone else .
Companies that do so use computers more efficiently and thus reduce not only their costs but also their carbon footprints .
Another way to improve the situation is virtualisation — the creation of “ virtual ” machines ( ie , software emulations of separate computers ) so that multiple operating systems and applications can run on the same piece of physical kit .
Sun Microsystems , a maker of servers , reckons that 70 % of the servers in most organisations have only one application running on them .
Consolidating these applications onto fewer and fewer machines , courtesy of virtualisation , would be more efficient and thus greener .
Ironically , of course , environmental research itself relies heavily on computers .
So , perhaps the best thing the home user can do is donate his inefficiencies to the cause by signing up to climateprediction .
net , which uses the idle capacity of home computers to test the accuracy of various computer models of the climate .
Saturn 's rings are seen in this infrared NASA image taken by the The Cassini spacecraft high above the planet 's northern latitudes .
( UPI Photo / NASA ) | License Photo
PASADENA , Calif. , Sept. 21 ( UPI ) -- NASA scientists say they are surprised at the extent of ruffles and dust clouds discovered in the rings of Saturn by the Cassini spacecraft .
Researchers , who once thought the rings were nearly completely flat , say Cassini 's newest images reveal the heights of some recently discovered bumps in the rings are as high as the Rocky Mountains .

" It 's like putting on 3 - D glasses and seeing the third dimension for the first time , " said Bob Pappalardo , Cassini project scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" This is among the most important events Cassini has shown us . "
The images were taken Aug. 11 , when sunlight hit Saturn 's rings exactly edge - on , performing " a celestial magic trick " that made them all but disappear , NASA said , noting the event occurs twice during each orbit Saturn makes around the sun , which takes approximately 10,759 Earth days , or about 29.7 Earth years .
Earth experiences a similar equinox phenomenon twice a year .
" We thought the plane of the rings was no taller than two stories of a modern - day building and instead we 've come across walls more than two miles high , " said Carolyn Porco , Cassini imaging team leader at the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colo .
" Is n't that the most outrageous thing you could imagine ?
It truly is like something out of science fiction . "
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA and the European and Italian Space Agencies .
If there 's one lesson boys learn when growing up , it 's the value of being tough , the value of winning .
The heroes of the big screen portray the ideal man as rough and rugged .
James
Bond never gives up .
Neither did the characters played by John Wayne .
And Rocky always won the big fight - or if he did n't win , he at least “ goes the distance . ”
Those guys never gave up .
And we do n't want to give up either .
That resistance to raising the white flag serves men well during war or in a job situation that requires perseverance .
It can help us hang in there when times are tough in a relationship .
But when it comes to compulsive behavior , a refusal to give up only prolongs our agony .
It leads to greater enslavement and harm .
Of course , most of us wo n't surrender until we know we 're beaten or we know defeat is on the way .
Maybe you 're not convinced you even have a problem , or if you are , you 're not sure how serious it is .
[ Addictive Stages | Moment of truth ]
How to Know If You 're Hooked It 's important to understand that sexual addictions do n't happen overnight .
They take time to develop .
But when they 're full - blown , a man wo n't be able to resist the repeated urge to enter into a love relationship with a sexual object or experience that gives him pleasure and the illusion of intimacy .
That last sentence defines an addict :
He 's hooked and can't say no .
The object of his addiction gives him two things : pleasure and an illusion of intimacy .
Not everyone who struggles with sexual compulsions is an addict .
Some men abuse their sexuality for a period of time and then grow out of it .
Many men with a regrettable sexual experience in the past put it behind them and move on .
But not everyone is so fortunate .
Some men block emotional pain with sexual pleasure .
Over time they have to try increasingly risky forms of sexual behavior in order to deaden the pain .
Eventually their world revolves around sex .
Their obsession has taken over their life .
The Sexual Addiction Test Patrick Carnes suggests a series of four questions aimed at helping us discover if we have a sexual addiction and if so , how far it 's progressed .
[ 1 ]
While asking yourself these questions , it 's crucial that you are brutally honest .
The first step in dealing with a problem is admitting we have one .
ONE - Is Your Behavior Secret ?
Are you doing things you refuse to tell others about ?
Do you feel that if those closest to you knew what you were doing , they would reject you or strongly disapprove of your actions ?
Are you telling lies to cover your behavior ?
If so , you 're isolating yourself from those you love and entering into a potentially addictive relationship with an object or event .
TWO - Is Your Behavior Abusive ?
Does your sexual behavior create pain ( emotional or physical ) for you or others ?
Is it degrading or exploitative of others ?
Do you find yourself performing increasingly abusive acts ?
Do you derive pleasure from watching others being abused in some way ?
THREE - Is Your Behavior Used to Deaden Painful Feelings ?
Are your sexual actions an effort to change your mood rather than express affections ?
Do you masturbate or search for some other sexual outlet when you 're depressed , bored , or angry ?
If your sexual behavior is used to erase pain , it 's part of an addictive process .
FOUR - Is Your Behavior Empty of Genuine Commitment and Caring ?
Are you substituting the illusion of intimacy provided by an object or event for the genuine intimacy found in a healthy relationship ?
If you answered yes to even one of the four questions , your sexual behavior is either compulsive or addictive .
Addictive Stages
While the four questions help determine if we have a problem , they do n't tell us the extent of the problem .
In order to determine that , we need to familiarize ourselves with the levels of addictions .
[ 2 ]
Pre-addiction Pre-addiction describes people who begin to find themselves sexually stimulated through impersonal objects , like pornography , or events , like strip clubs .
If you 're at this level , your life is probably under control .
You 're holding down a job , and your relationship with your wife or girlfriend is intact .
However , you realize that while your fascination with pornography , strip shows , or erotic talk lines is n't compulsive , it is dangerous .
You may be troubled by the feeling that your slumbering lust could awaken and take over at any moment .
Level 1
At level 1 a man 's lust has begun to exert its control .
He 's compulsively involved in such things as masturbation , pornography , homosexuality , or demeaning heterosexual relationships .
When a man reaches level 1 , something significant has happened .
While before he always struggled to keep his lust under control , now it 's running wild .
In his book The Addictive Personality , Craig Nakken notes that the single most important aspect of level 1 addictions is the emergence of the addictive personality . [ 3 ]
A man 's lust , like a great dragon , has awakened from its slumber and threatens to take over his life .
I experienced this the night I looked through my neighbor 's window .
It reminded me of the first time I got high on marijuana .
I entered a new world and wanted to return to that world .
There 's something about that first high that people want to recreate .
Similarly , a man who enters level 1 awakens his lust in a powerful way .
And that initial experience is one he wants to recreate .
When we enter level 1 , the addictive part of our personality has been stirred .
And make no mistake about it , the beast has an insatiable appetite that can slowly take over our life .
Level 2
When a man reaches level 2 , he 's taken a bigger and more dangerous step .
Now his behavior involves victims and violations of the law .
His activities include prostitution , exhibitionism , voyeurism , obscene phone calls , and touching a person intimately without consent .
Most of the time he 's considered more of a nuisance than a criminal , but unfortunately his behavior can inflict deep emotional pain on his victims .
Men who are exhibitionists or voyeurs will carry out their secret behavior for years .
Living double lives , they 're in constant fear of being caught .
All kinds of “ good ” people reach level 2 .
Hardly a week passes without a news story about a politician , teacher , or Hollywood star picking up a prostitute or making an unwanted sexual advance .
Level 3
By the time a man reaches level 3 , his behavior involves serious crimes in which severe damage is done to the victim .
Rape , incest , and child molestation occur at this level .
The Moment of Truth By now you should know if you 're hooked .
You should also have a feel for how far your sexual compulsion has progressed .
While most of us would prefer avoiding the truth for as long as we can , eventually the moment of truth will arrive .
Something will happen to force you to admit that your life is out of control .
You 'll accidentally leave a pornographic image on your computer monitor , and someone at work will report it to your boss .
One of your kids will find your stash of X - rated videos .
A policeman will arrive at your place of work because a neighbor has identified you as a Peeping Tom .
Your wife will leave because you 've had another affair .
The school counselor will call because you 've been reported to the child care agency for improperly touching a neighbor child .
For Samson , the moment of truth arrived near the end of his life .
Blinded by lust , he slept in Delilah 's lap while a Philistine barber cut his hair .
A moment after the last strand fell , his enemies burst into his presence .
Isolated from God , he was powerless to resist .
Israel 's champion became a bald - headed clown who entertained the Philistines .
Samson had fallen .
He would never gaze at another Philistine woman .
His enemies had made sure of that when they gouged out his eyes ( Judges 16:20 - 21 ) .
Many people believe that Samson 's story ends on a tragic note .
I do n't .
Although he was blind and imprisoned , his hair began to grow , and so did his relationship with God .
The Lord forgave Samson and used him one last time .
The hero of Judah pulled down a Philistine temple , destroying himself and his enemies .
Samson learned firsthand what every man must know .
God is the God of a second and third and fourth chance .
He never gives up on us .

It was a summer of ups and downs for January Schofield , the child diagnosed with schizophrenia who was the subject of a Los Angeles Times article on June 29 .
Jani spent a good part of the summer in the child psychiatric unit at UCLA .
She was discharged from her second extended stay at UCLA on Aug. 5 on a new medication , Clozaril .
The antipsychotic medication can cause serious side effects but has helped many people with schizophrenia to resume functional lives .
For Jani , it 's the last line of defense .
There are no other medications to try if Clozaril fails to help her .
The major setback for Michael and Susan Schofield , Jani 's parents , was learning that she was not accepted into a top - flight study on child schizophrenia at the National Institute of Mental Health .
By enrolling in the study , the Schofields had hoped that Jani , who turned 7 in August , would be evaluated by the world 's leading authorities and that they could learn more about the illness .
However , at some time in utero , at birth or shortly thereafter , Jani suffered oxygen deprivation that caused cells in a small area in her brain , in the thalamus , to die off .
The brain damage is not thought to have caused the schizophrenia , although it 's possible it contributes to the severity of her symptoms .
Nevertheless , the defect disqualified Jani from the study because participants must be free of any disorders or injuries other than schizophrenia .
It was a crushing blow to the couple .
" I was looking for the U.S. government to say , ' Yes , your child has schizophrenia , ' and that we would have the full force of the federal government behind us , " Michael said .
Jani was released from UCLA on Aug. 5 and came home to the two - apartment system her parents set up to care for her and keep her baby brother , Bodhi , safe from Jani 's erratic behavior .
The Schofields were worried .
They had hoped she could attend an outpatient day program for mentally ill children at UCLA .
But they were told she was too psychotic .
The family , however , has been unable to find other outpatient services for her .
No public health services agency , it seems , is qualified to help a family with a psychotic child .
For a few weeks , the Clozaril , which Jani takes along with lithium , seemed to help .
She had fewer hallucinations and her violent outbursts waned .
She started first grade in a special education class at the Valencia elementary school where she attended a few months of kindergarten the year before .
The goal of attending school , the Schofields say , was n't so much for Jani to learn ( that is difficult due to her fractured attention span ) as to give her a safe place to be during the day so that the parents can have a break .
When Jani is home , she needs constant attention .
" The biggest worry we have is not having any services in place , " Michael said .
The week following Labor Day began badly .
The hallucinations of rats and cats that crowd Jani 's mind were becoming more prominent .
Two phantom figures -- Wednesday the rat and Four Hundred the cat -- are the restless hallucinations who urge Jani to do what she calls " bad things . "
That week , Wednesday told her to find a place to jump from 50 feet .
Jani told her parents about Wednesday 's command but informed them , " I 'm not listening . "
" I do think it 's a positive sign that she told us preemptively , " Michael said .
Four Hundred the cat had returned in early September after a pleasant absence .
" Jani became very insistent that we had to take care of Four Hundred to keep Four Hundred from bothering her , " Michael said .
On Sept. 10 , while at school , Jani said , Four Hundred told her to run out of her classroom three times .
On one occasion , Jani blindly followed the beckoning Four Hundred into the street .
She was readmitted to UCLA later that day .
" We took her back because we feared for her safety , " Michael said .
The Schofields hope their daughter 's hospitalization wo n't be lengthy .
The doctors are increasing her dose of Clozaril to 300 milligrams a day -- a dose similar to what adults take .
But the couple is struggling with feelings of failure and worries about the future .
" It hurts like hell to send her back to the hospital , " Michael said .
" When she 's in the hospital , we feel like we 've lost the battle -- not the war , but the battle -- and we need to regroup and prepare for the next battle . "
When Jani is discharged , she will not return to school .
" I 'm better at keeping her out of her psychoses , " Michael said .
" Special ed is just not set up for a child with schizophrenia .
And it 's difficult to trust anyone else to do what we do for Jani . "
The Clozaril has helped , overall , but it will never extinguish the mysterious animals and little girls that frolic in Jani's " other world , " which she calls Calalini .
" What we 've been told is that the hallucinations will never be entirely gone , " Michael said .
" This is the best we can get right now .
We 'll just have to muddle through this the best we can . "

Readers can follow developments on Jani at Michael 's blog , January First .
Hundreds of L.A. Times readers have sent in questions and comments about Jani 's story .
Michael and Susan Schofield sat down recently to answer some questions from readers .
1 ) Has Jani been tested for epilepsy ?
" She had a complete neurological work - up , an EEG , which was normal , and a sleep test , which showed she has restless limb syndrome .
I would like Jani to have a complete neurological workup , but I do n't want to subject her to needless tests .
What tests Jani has had are largely controlled by the insurance company .
It refuses to pay for a lot of tests .
. . .
That said , is a neurological problem the cause of her condition ?
No . "
2 ) Could her condition be caused by food allergies , nutritional imbalances or deficiencies of some kind ?
" The idea that food allergies or diet could cause psychosis is sort of outside mainstream medicine .
For parents who feel their children have been cured of severe mental problems by diet or vitamins , it could just be luck . "
Do you use any natural or holistic therapies ?
" I do n't trust that enough to put my child 's life in the hands of holistic therapies .
If it works for other people , great .
But we live in constant fear of Jani committing suicide or trying to hurt herself .
We are not in the position to try things and see what happens .
And I 'll be honest , I do n't think it would work .
I do n't believe there is someone out there with a magic answer . "
3 ) Do you believe prayer helps ?
" Susan and I both believe in a higher power , in God .
We believe that we are doing God 's work .
I think prayer is wonderful .
But I think God 's will is done through people .
Prayer is not enough .
God sends angels , but they are people who come to help .
We welcome people 's prayers .
I would say to them , thank you very much .
Do what you can do to make the world a better place . "
4 ) Does Jani have any chromosomal disorders ?
" As far as we know , no . "
5 ) Is n't this Asperger 's disease ?
" Asperger 's disease was ruled out by doctors .
Jani's obsessions are psychotic obsessions . "
6 ) Is n't this bipolar disorder ?
" Bipolar disorder was ruled out by the doctors .
In bipolar , the psychosis is the result of emotional swings , while in schizophrenia , the emotional state is caused by the psychosis .
In Jani , violence is brought on by hallucinations . "
7 ) Does music or art therapy help ?
" In the beginning , the problem was that if she could n't do something perfectly , she would n't do it .
She 's gotten better at that .
She enjoys projects at home .
It gives her a feeling of success . "
8 ) What is the significance of her fixation on numbers ?
" Every schizophrenic has certain hallucinations .
My personal theory is that when Jani 's illness was becoming acute , she was learning a lot at the time .
She was learning about animals and numbers .
At 13 months old , she knew her numbers to 20 , and she always loved animals .
And I think that is the form her hallucinations took . "
9 ) Why did you decide to make your story public ?
" I 'm tired of trying to explain it to people everywhere we go .
We can't hide .
. . .
Also , the only way to make this world livable for Jani is to explain to people that she is not a bad kid .
She has the most severe mental illness known to mankind .
We want to help the world understand this . "

This image illustrates what class inequality would look like if our level of income / wealth were reflected in our height ( click to enlarge ) .
Class inequality was first described this way by economist Jan Pen .
The image was reproduced for an Atlantic article ( view here ) .
Even though the illustration is for 1971 and Britain , it would be useful , especially if we had evidence that income inequality is greater now than in 1971 and greater in the U.S. ( or wherever you are ) than in Britain ( which I think is true … anyone ? ) .
An excerpt explaining the illustration is included below .
( By the way , what first looked to me like a dark green blob behind the tallest guy is actually the foot of the next tallest guy . )
Excerpt :
Suppose that every person in the economy walks by , as if in a parade .
Imagine that the parade takes exactly an hour to pass , and that the marchers are arranged in order of income , with the lowest incomes at the front and the highest at the back .
Also imagine that the heights of the people in the parade are proportional to what they make : those earning the average income will be of average height , those earning twice the average income will be twice the average height , and so on .
We spectators , let us imagine , are also of average height .
Pen then described what the observers would see .
Not a series of people of steadily increasing height — that ’s far too bland a picture .
The observers would see something much stranger .
They would see , mostly , a parade of dwarves , and then some unbelievable giants at the very end .
As the parade begins , Pen explained , the marchers can not be seen at all .
They are walking upside down , with their heads underground — owners of loss - making businesses , most likely .
Very soon , upright marchers begin to pass by , but they are tiny .
For five minutes or so , the observers are peering down at people just inches high — old people and youngsters , mainly ; people without regular work , who make a little from odd jobs .
Ten minutes in , the full - time labor force has arrived : to begin with , mainly unskilled manual and clerical workers , burger flippers , shop assistants , and the like , standing about waist - high to the observers .
And at this point things start to get dull , because there are so very many of these very small people .
The minutes pass , and pass , and they keep on coming .
By about halfway through the parade , Pen wrote , the observers might expect to be looking people in the eye — people of average height ought to be in the middle .
But no , the marchers are still quite small , these experienced tradespeople , skilled industrial workers , trained office staff , and so on — not yet five feet tall , many of them .
On and on they come .
It takes about forty - five minutes — the parade is drawing to a close — before the marchers are as tall as the observers .
Heights are visibly rising by this point , but even now not very fast .
In the final six minutes , however , when people with earnings in the top 10 percent begin to arrive , things get weird again .
Heights begin to surge upward at a madly accelerating rate .
Doctors , lawyers , and senior civil servants twenty feet tall speed by .
Moments later , successful corporate executives , bankers , stock­brokers — peering down from fifty feet , 100 feet , 500 feet .
In the last few seconds you glimpse pop stars , movie stars , the most successful entrepreneurs .
You can see only up to their knees ( this is Britain : it ’s cloudy ) .
And if you blink , you ’ll miss them altogether .
At the very end of the parade ( it ’s 1971 , recall ) is John Paul Getty , heir to the Getty Oil fortune .
The sole of his shoe is hundreds of feet thick .
The Writing Process By Ali Hale
Whether you know it or not , there ’s a process to writing – which many writers follow naturally .
If you ’re just getting started as a writer , though , or if you always find it a struggle to produce an essay , short story or blog , following the writing process will help .
I ’m going to explain what each stage of the writing process involves , and I ’ll offer some tips for each section that will help out if you ’re still feeling stuck !
1. Prewriting
Have you ever sat staring at a blank piece of paper or a blank document on your computer screen ?
You might have skipped the vital first stage of the writing process : prewriting .
This covers everything you do before starting your rough draft .
As a minimum , prewriting means coming up with an idea !
Ideas and Inspiration
Ideas are all around you .
If you want to write but you do n’t have any ideas , try :
Using a writing prompt to get you started .
Writing about incidents from your daily life , or childhood .
Keeping a notebook of ideas – jotting down those thoughts that occur throughout the day .
Creating a vivid character , and then writing about him / her .
See also How to Generate Hundreds of Writing Ideas .
Tip :
Once you have an idea , you need to expand on it .
Do n’t make the mistake of jumping straight into your writing – you ’ll end up with a badly structured piece .
Building on Your Idea
These are a couple of popular methods you can use to add flesh to the bones of your idea :
Free writing :
Open a new document or start a new page , and write everything that comes into your head about your chosen topic .
Do n’t stop to edit , even if you make mistakes .
: Open a new document or start a new page , and write everything that comes into your head about your chosen topic .
Do n’t stop to edit , even if you make mistakes .
Brainstorming : Write the idea or topic in the center of your page .
Jot down ideas that arise from it – sub - topics or directions you could take with the article .
Once you ’ve done one or both of these , you need to select what ’s going into your first draft .
Planning and Structure
Some pieces of writing will require more planning than others .
Typically , longer pieces and academic papers need a lot of thought at this stage .
First , decide which ideas you ’ll use .
During your free writing and brainstorming , you ’ll have come up with lots of thoughts .
Some belong in this piece of writing : others can be kept for another time .
Then , decide how to order those ideas .
Try to have a logical progression .
Sometimes , your topic will make this easy : in this article , for instance , it made sense to take each step of the writing process in order .
For a short story , try the eight - point story arc .
2. Writing
Sit down with your plan beside you , and start your first draft ( also known as the rough draft or rough copy ) .
At this stage , do n’t think about word - count , grammar , spelling and punctuation .
Do n’t worry if you ’ve gone off - topic , or if some sections of your plan do n’t fit too well .
Just keep writing !
If you ’re a new writer , you might be surprised that professional authors go through multiple drafts before they ’re happy with their work .
This is a normal part of the writing process – no - one gets it right first time .
Some things that many writers find helpful when working on the first draft include :
Setting aside at least thirty minutes to concentrate : it ’s hard to establish a writing flow if you ’re just snatching a few minutes here and there .
: it ’s hard to establish a writing flow if you ’re just snatching a few minutes here and there .
Going somewhere without interruptions : a library or coffee shop can work well , if you do n’t have anywhere quiet to write at home .
: a library or coffee shop can work well , if you do n’t have anywhere quiet to write at home .
Switching off distracting programs : if you write your first draft onto a computer , you might find that turning off your Internet connection does wonders for your concentration levels !
When I ’m writing fiction , I like to use the free program Dark Room ( you can find more about it on our collection of writing software ) .
You might write several drafts , especially if you ’re working on fiction .
Your subsequent drafts will probably merge elements of the writing stage and the revising stage .
Tip : Writing requires concentration and energy .
If you ’re a new writer , do n’t try to write for hours without stopping .
Instead , give yourself a time limit ( like thirty minutes ) to really focus – without checking your email !
3. Revising
Revising your work is about making “ big picture ” changes .
You might remove whole sections , rewrite entire paragraphs , and add in information which you ’ve realized the reader will need .
Everyone needs to revise – even talented writers .
The revision stage is sometimes summed up with the A.R.R.R. ( Adding , Rearranging , Removing , Replacing ) approach :
Adding
What else does the reader need to know ?
If you have n’t met the required word - count , what areas could you expand on ?
This is a good point to go back to your prewriting notes – look for ideas which you did n’t use .
Rearranging
Even when you ’ve planned your piece , sections may need rearranging .
Perhaps as you wrote your essay , you found that the argument would flow better if you reordered your paragraphs .
Maybe you ’ve written a short story that drags in the middle but packs in too much at the end .
Removing
Sometimes , one of your ideas does n’t work out .
Perhaps you ’ve gone over the word count , and you need to take out a few paragraphs .
Maybe that funny story does n’t really fit with the rest of your article .
Replacing
Would more vivid details help bring your piece to life ?
Do you need to look for stronger examples and quotations to support your argument ?
If a particular paragraph is n’t working , try rewriting it .
Tip :
If you ’re not sure what ’s working and what is n’t , show your writing to someone else .
This might be a writers ’ circle , or just a friend who ’s good with words .
Ask them for feedback .
It ’s best if you can show your work to several people , so that you can get more than one opinion .
4. Editing
The editing stage is distinct from revision , and needs to be done after revising .
Editing involves the close - up view of individual sentences and words .
It needs to be done after you ’ve made revisions on a big scale : or else you could agonize over a perfect sentence , only to end up cutting that whole paragraph from your piece .
When editing , go through your piece line by line , and make sure that each sentence , phrase and word is as strong as possible .
Some things to check for are :
Have you used the same word too many times in one sentence or paragraph ?
Use a thesaurus to find alternatives .
in one sentence or paragraph ?
Use a thesaurus to find alternatives .
Are any of your sentences hard to understand ?
Rewrite them to make your thoughts clear .
?
Rewrite them to make your thoughts clear .
Which words could you cut to make a sentence stronger ?
Words like “ just ” “ quite ” , “ very ” , “ really ” and “ generally ” can often be removed .

Words like “ just ” “ quite ” , “ very ” , “ really ” and “ generally ” can often be removed .
Are your sentences grammatically correct ?
Keep a careful look out for problems like subject - verb agreement and staying consistent in your use of the past , present or future tense .

Have you used punctuation marks correctly ?
Commas often cause difficulties .
You might want to check out the Daily Writing Tips articles on punctuation .
Tip : Print out your work and edit on paper .
Many writers find it easier to spot mistakes this way .
5. Publishing
The final step of the writing process is publishing .
This means different things depending on the piece you ’re working on .
Bloggers need to upload , format and post their piece of completed work .
Students need to produce a final copy of their work , in the correct format .
This often means adding a bibliography , ensuring that citations are correct , and adding details such as your student reference number .
Journalists need to submit their piece ( usually called “ copy ” ) to an editor .
Again , there will be a certain format for this .
Fiction writers may be sending their story to a magazine or competition .
Check guidelines carefully , and make sure you follow them .
If you ’ve written a novel , look for an agent who represents your genre .
( There are books like Writer ’s Market , published each year , which can help you with this . )
Tip :
Your piece of writing might never be published .
That ’s okay – many bestselling authors wrote lots of stories or articles before they got their first piece published .
Nothing that you write is wasted , because it all contributes to your growth as a writer .
Conclusion
The five stages of the writing process are a framework for writing well and easily .

Next time you 're faced with a serious bug infestation , you might try spraying your house with eau - de - death .
Scientists have discovered that insects from cockroaches to caterpillars all emit the same stinky blend of fatty acids when they die , and this sinister stench sends bugs of all kinds running for their lives .
Biologist David Rollo of McMaster University in Canada made this morbid discovery while studying the social behavior of cockroaches .
When a roach locates a great new abode ( like your kitchen cupboard ) , it gives off a chemical signal to attract its cockroach friends .
To determine the chemical composition of these pheromones , Rollo and his team started crushing dead cockroaches and spreading around their body juice .
" It was amazing to find that the cockroaches avoided places treated with these extracts like the plague , " Rollo said in a press release .
" Naturally , we wanted to identify what chemical was making them all go away . "
Of course , there was nothing to do but grind up more bugs .
The team found that their concoction repelled not just cockroaches , but ants , catepillars , woodlice and pillbugs .
And even though they 're technically crustaceans rather than insects , dead woodlice and pill bugs produced the same set of fatty acids as the other animals .
Insects and crustaceans diverged from each other 400 million years ago , so the researchers think their death mix represents a universal , ancient warning signal .
" Recognizing and avoiding the dead could reduce the chances of catching the disease , " Rollo said in the release , " or allow you to get away with just enough exposure to activate your immunity . "
The researchers published their findings in this month 's edition of Evolutionary Biology .
The scientists hope the right concoction of death smells might protect crops against pesky invaders .
For instance , a log treated with the fatty acids repelled wood beetles in a forest for a full month .
Thankfully , human noses can't detect the fatty acid extracts .
" Not like the rotting of corpses that occurs later and is detectable from great distances , " Rollo wrote in an e-mail .
" I 've tried smelling papers treated with them and do n't smell anything strong and certainly not repellent . "

In an attempt to head off a major commercial fishing march into the Arctic , the Obama administration has declared a moratorium on expanded fishing in the still - uncharted waters of the far north , a move which as the nearly unprecedented support of both conservationists and the fishing industry .
The
The U.S. move is seen as the first step in negotiating a similar , multinational moratorium on fishing in international waters of the Arctic at a time when fishing fleets from around the globe are signaling an interest in moving into the pristine waters that hold stocks of crab , Arctic cod , saffron cod and , increasingly , limited numbers of pollock and salmon as they migrate north into warming waters .
Fish like Arctic cod are not only a potential commercial resource -- they are a crucial food source for many marine mammals , birds and other fish whose sources of nutrition may be diminishing with the polar sea ice .
" As Arctic sea ice recedes due to climate change , there is increasing interest in commercial fishing in Arctic waters , " Locke said .
" We are in a position to plan for sustainable fishing that does not damage the overall health of this fragile ecosystem .
This plan takes a precautionary approach to any development of commercial fishing in an area where there has been none in the past . "
The announcement by Commerce Secretary Gary Locke bans the expansion of most commercial fishing beyond the Alaskan coast until broad new scientific studies can determine what fish stocks exist and how crucial they are to maintaining a fragile Arctic ecosystem already facing substantial stress because of melting sea ice and rising sea acid levels .
The U.S. move is seen as the first step in negotiating a similar , multinational moratorium on fishing in international waters of the Arctic at a time when fishing fleets from around the globe are signaling an interest in moving into the pristine waters that hold stocks of crab , Arctic cod , saffron cod and , increasingly , limited numbers of pollock and salmon as they migrate north into warming waters .

" As Arctic sea ice recedes due to climate change , there is increasing interest in commercial fishing in Arctic waters , " Locke said .
" We are in a position to plan for sustainable fishing that does not damage the overall health of this fragile ecosystem .
This plan takes a precautionary approach to any development of commercial fishing in an area where there has been none in the past . "
The order , recommended by the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council in February , restricts any future commercial fishing for finfish and shellfish in nearly 200,000 square miles of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas , north of the Bering Straits off the coast of Alaska .
It does not apply to Pacific salmon and Pacific halibut , which are managed under other authorities , and does not restrict Native Alaskans to continue subsistence fishing in the region .
It provides that any fishing allowed in the future , once scientific studies are in place , will be subject to strict monitoring and strong restrictions on catch levels , fishing gear , discarded fish and areas permitted for fishing .
" This is the first time an administration has taken the time to protect an entire marine ecosystem before commercial fishing took place .
It is historic -- a model for how we should work in the Arctic ocean and take a precautionary approach , " said Marilyn Heiman , U.S. Arctic program director for the Pew Environment Group .
" It is what can happen if conservationists and industry work together , " said Jim Ayers , Pacific region vice president for the marine protection group Oceana .
" It demonstrates there is a collective wisdom that the Arctic needs to be dealt with differently than our other resources have been dealt with in the past , and happily it sets a a paradigm as well for the oil industry . "
The U.S. government is reviewing plans to open large tracts of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas to offshore oil and gas exploration , a move which until now has been blocked in the courts .
The support of major fishing industry groups in freezing commercial fishing expansion in the Arctic marked one of the few times the industry has supported blocking off entire regions , but there has been widespread support even among fishermen for allowing time for sufficient studies to learn what is in the Arctic environment .
" The importance is now with the fisheries management plan .
The U.S. is on good footing to engage our Russian and Canadian neighbors in bilateral talks to try and get agreement on an international moratorium in international waters of the Arctic , " said David Benton of the Alaska - based Marine Conservation Alliance , which represents fishing companies , processors and ports .
Benton said pollock stocks in the Bering Sea had reached more than 2 million metric tons in the 1980s , but sharply collapsed when fishing fleets from China , Japan , Poland and Korea began heavily fishing the unregulated waters between Russia .
A 1994 international agreement imposed a moratorium on fishing in the area known as the " doughnut hole . "
" That 's an instructive lesson for what could unfold in the high Arctic , " Benton said at a hearing on Arctic issues Thursday in Anchorage .
" The United States had to be on good , solid footing to then go to the rest of the world and say , ' We do n’t want to repeat what happened in the Bering Sea . ' "
Conservationists believe fishing should be held at bay until studies can measure not only the numbers of fish but the complex inter-connections between fish , birds , marine mammals and the ocean itself .
" We really know very little about the Arctic in terms of basic biological information -- what species are even there , how abundant are they , where do they occur , much less the more complicated thing , which is what drives the productivity of the area , the functioning of the ecosystem , " said Chris Krenz , Oceana 's Arctic program manager .
" Without some serious attention , we risk some pretty serious environmental degradation in the region . "

Lingling WeiMarket enthusiasm for the Federal Reserve 's plan to help the commercial - real - estate market was doused Tuesday after Standard & Poor 's warned that billions of dollars of top- rated bonds backed by commercial mortgages could face downgrades .
The financing drought in commercial real estate is threatening to cause major damage to the economy , so the sector was cheered when the Fed announced in March that it would expand one of its main rescue programs to help resuscitate the $ 700 billion market for bonds backed by mortgages ...
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - South Carolina Republican Representative Joe Wilson , who faces possible censure in the U.S. House of Representatives for shouting “ You lie ! ” during President Barack Obama ’s speech to Congress on healthcare reform , said on Sunday he would not apologize again .
Calling his outburst on Wednesday evening “ a town hall moment , ” Wilson told “ Fox News Sunday ” that since his apology to the president had already been accepted , he did not plan to apologize on the House floor as Democrats have demanded .
“ I ’ve apologized one time .
The apology was accepted by the president , the vice president .
... I am not apologizing again , ” he said .
Wilson added he would “ never do something like that again , ” but continued to defend himself , saying : “ I believe in the truth .
What I heard was not true .
I believe ( Obama ) was misstating the facts . ”
Wilson ’s shouted comment , which both Republicans and Democrats have called a breach of political decorum , followed Obama ’s statement that healthcare reforms being proposed would not cover illegal immigrants .
If Wilson does not apologize in the House , Democratic Party leaders will likely call for a resolution of disapproval , a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday .
Campaign contributions to both Wilson and Democrat Rob Miller , who plans to challenge him in November 2010 , have quickly soared to more than $ 1 million each in the wake of the outburst , according to party officials .

Nicolaus Copernicus ( 1473 –1543 ) was a mathematician and astronomer who proposed that the sun was stationary in the center of the universe and the earth revolved around it .
Disturbed by the failure of Ptolemy ’s geocentric model of the universe to follow Aristotle ’s requirement for the uniform circular motion of all celestial bodies and determined to eliminate Ptolemy ’s equant , an imaginary point around which the bodies seemed to follow that requirement , Copernicus decided that he could achieve his goal only through a heliocentric model .
He thereby created a concept of a universe in which the distances of the planets from the sun bore a direct relationship to the size of their orbits .
At the time Copernicus ’s heliocentric idea was very controversial ; nevertheless , it was the start of a change in the way the world was viewed , and Copernicus came to be seen as the initiator of the Scientific Revolution .
1. Life and Works
Nicolaus Copernicus was born on 19 February 1473 , the youngest of four children of Nicolaus Copernicus , Sr. , a well - to - do merchant who had moved to Torun from Cracow , and Barbara Watzenrode , the daughter of a leading merchant family in Torun .
The city , on the Vistula River , had been an important inland port in the Hanseatic League .
However , fighting between the Order of the Teutonic Knights and the Prussian Union in alliance with the Kingdom of Poland ended in 1466 , and West Prussia , which included Torun , was ceded to Poland , and Torun was declared a free city of the Polish kingdom .
Thus the child of a German family was a subject of the Polish crown .
The father died in 1483 , and the children ’s maternal uncle , Lucas Watzenrode ( 1447–1512 ) , took them under his protection .
Watzenrode was a very successful cleric – he was to become bishop of Warmia ( Ermland in German ) in 1489 – and he both facilitated his nephew ’s advancement in the church and directed his education .
In 1491 Copernicus enrolled in the University of Cracow .
There is no record of his having obtained a degree , which was not unusual at the time as he did not need a bachelor ’s degree for his ecclesiastical career or even to study for a higher degree .
But the University of Cracow offered courses in mathematics , astronomy , and astrology ( see Goddu 25 –33 on all the university offerings ) , and Copernicus ’s interest was sparked , which is attested to by his acquisition of books in these subjects while at Cracow . [ 1 ]
In 1495 Watzenrode arranged Copernicus ’s election as canon of the chapter of Frombork ( Frauenberg in German ) of the Cathedral Chapter of Warmia , an administrative position just below that of bishop .
He assumed the post two years later , and his financial situation was secure for life .
In the meantime , following in his uncle ’s footsteps , Copernicus went to the University of Bologna in 1496 to study canon law ( see Goddu part 2 on what Copernicus may have encountered in Italy ) .
While at Bologna he lived with the astronomy professor Domenico Maria Novara and made his first astronomical observations .
In addition , as Rosen ( 1971 , 323 ) noted , “ In establishing close contact with Novara , Copernicus met , perhaps for the first time in his life , a mind that dared to challenge the authority of [ Ptolemy ] the most eminent ancient writer in his chosen fields of study . ”
Copernicus also gave a lecture on mathematics in Rome , which may have focused on astronomy .
Copernicus ’s studies at Bologna provided an advantage he did not have at Cracow – a teacher of Greek .
Humanism began to infiltrate the Italian universities in the fifteenth century .
As Grendler ( 510 ) remarked , “ By the last quarter of the century , practically all universities had one or several humanists , many of them major scholars . ”
Antonio Cortesi Urceo , called Codro , became professor at Bologna in 1482 and added Greek several years later .
Copernicus may have studied with him , for Copernicus translated into Latin the letters of the seventh - century Byzantine author Theophylactus Simocatta ( MW 27 –71 ) from the 1499 edition of a collection of Greek letters produced by the Venetian humanist printer Aldus Manutius .
Aldus had dedicated his edition to Urceo .
Copernicus had his translation printed in 1509 , his only publication prior to the On the Revolutions ( De revolutionibus ) .
It is important to note that Copernicus ’s acquisition of a good reading knowledge of Greek was critical for his studies in astronomy because major works by Greek astronomers , including Ptolemy , had not yet been translated into Latin , the language of the universities at the time .
Copernicus left Bologna for Frombork in 1501 without having obtained his degree .
The chapter then approved another leave of absence for Copernicus to study medicine at the University of Padua .
The medical curriculum did not just include medicine , anatomy , and the like when Copernicus studied it .
Siraisi ( 1990 , 16 ) noted that “ the reception in twefth - century western Europe of Greek and Islamic technical astronomy and astrology fostered the development of medical astrology … the actual practice of medical astrology was greatest in the West between the fourteenth and the sixteenth centuries . ”
Astrology was taught in the medical schools of Italy .
“ The importance attached to the study of the stars in medieval medical education derived from a general and widely held belief that the heavenly bodies play an intermediary role in the creation of things here below and continue to influence them throughout their existence .
The actual uses of astrology in medical diagnosis and treatment by learned physicians were many and various .
‘ Astrological medicine ’ is a vague and unsatisfactory term that can embrace any or all of the following : first , to pay attention to the supposed effect of astrological birth signs or signs at conception on the constitution and character of one ’s patients ; second , to vary treatment according to various celestial conditions … third , to connect the doctrine of critical days in illness with astrological features , usually phases of the moon ; and fourth , to predict or explain epidemics with reference to planetary conjunctions , the appearance of comets , or weather conditions ” ( Siraisi , 1981 , 141–42 ) .
It is true that astrology required that medical students acquire some grounding in astronomy ; nevertheless , it is likely that Copernicus studied astrology while at the University of Padua . [ 2 ]
Copernicus did not receive his medical degree from Padua ; the degree would have taken three years , and Copernicus had only been granted a two - year leave of absence by his chapter .
Instead he matriculated in the University of Ferrara , from which he obtained a doctorate in canon law .
But he did not return to his chapter in Frombork ; rather he went to live with his uncle in the episcopal palace in Lidzbark - Warminski ( Heilsberg in German ) .
Although he made some astronomical observations , he was immersed in church politics , and after his elderly uncle became ill in 1507 , Copernicus was his attending physician .
Rosen ( 1971 , 334–35 ) reasonably conjectured that the bishop may have hoped that his nephew would be his successor , but Copernicus left his uncle because his duties in Lidzbark - Warminski interfered with his continuing pursuit of his studies in astronomy .
He took up residence in his chapter of Frombork in 1510 and stayed there the rest of his life .
Not that leaving his uncle and moving to Frombork exempted Copernicus from continued involvement in administrative and political duties .
He was responsible for the administration of various holdings , which involved heading the provisioning fund , adjudicating disputes , attending meetings , and keeping accounts and records .
In response to the problem he found with the local currency , he drafted an essay on coinage ( MW 176–215 ) in which he deplored the debasement of the currency and made recommendations for reform .
His manuscripts were consulted by the leaders of both Prussia and Poland in their attempts to stabilize the currency .
He was a leader for West Prussia in the war against the Teutonic Knights , which lasted from 1520 – 1525 .
He was physician for the bishop ( his uncle had died in 1512 ) and members of the chapter , and he was consulting physician for notables in East and West Prussia .
Nevertheless , Copernicus began to work on astronomy on his own .
Sometime between 1510 and 1514 he wrote an essay that has come to be known as the Commentariolus ( MW 75 – 126 ) that introduced his new cosmological idea , the heliocentric universe , and he sent copies to various astronomers .
He continued making astronomical observations whenever he could , hampered by the poor position for observations in Frombork and his many pressing responsibilities as canon .
Nevertheless , he kept working on his manuscript of On the Revolutions .
He also wrote what is known as Letter against Werner ( MW 145–65 ) in 1524 , a critique of Johann Werner ’s “ Letter concerning the Motion of the Eighth Sphere ” ( De motu octavae sphaerae tractatus primus ) .
Copernicus claimed that Werner erred in his calculation of time and his belief that before Ptolemy the movement of the fixed stars was uniform , but Copernicus ’s letter did not refer to his cosmological ideas .
In 1539 a young mathematician named Georg Joachim Rheticus ( 1514 –1574 ) from the University of Wittenberg came to study with Copernicus .
Rheticus brought Copernicus books in mathematics , in part to show Copernicus the quality of printing that was available in the German - speaking cities .
He published an introduction to Copernicus ’s ideas , the Narratio prima ( First Report ) .
Most importantly , he convinced Copernicus to publish On the Revolutions .
Rheticus oversaw most of the printing of the book , and on 24 May 1543 Copernicus held a copy of the finished work on his deathbed .
2. Astronomical Ideas and Writings
2.1 Pre-Copernican Astronomy
Classical astronomy followed principles established by Aristotle .
Aristotle accepted the idea that there were four physical elements – earth , water , air , and fire .
He put the earth in the center of the universe and contended that these elements were below the moon , which was the closest celestial body .
There were seven planets , or wandering stars , because they had a course through the zodiac in addition to traveling around the earth : the moon , Mercury , Venus , the sun , Mars , Jupiter .
Beyond that were the fixed stars .
The physical elements , according to Aristotle moved vertically , depending on their ‘ heaviness ’ or ‘ gravity ’ ; the celestial bodies were not physical but a ‘ fifth element ’ or ‘ quintessence ’ whose nature was to move in perfect circles around the earth , making a daily rotation .
Aristotle envisioned the earth as the true center of all the circles or ‘ orbs ’ carrying the heavenly bodies around it and all motion as ‘ uniform , ’ that is , unchanging .
But observers realized that the heavenly bodies did not move as Aristotle postulated .
The earth was not the true center of the orbits and the motion was not uniform .
The most obvious problem was that the outer planets seemed to stop , move backwards in ‘ retrograde ’ motion for a while , and then continue forwards .
By the second century , when Ptolemy compiled his Almagest ( this common name of Ptolemy ’s Syntaxis was derived from its Arabic title ) , astronomers had developed the concept that the orbit moves in ‘ epicycles ’ around a ‘ deferrent , ’ that is , they move like a flat heliacal coil around a circle around the earth .
The earth was also off - center , on an ‘ eccentric , ’ as the heavenly bodies moved around a central point .
Ptolemy added a point on a straight line opposite the eccentric , which is called the ‘ equalizing point ’ or the ‘ equant , ’ and around this point the heavenly bodies moved uniformly .
Moreover , unlike the Aristotelian model , Ptolemy ’s Almagest did not describe a unified universe .
The ancient astronomers who followed Ptolemy , however , were not concerned if his system did not describe the ‘ true ’ motions of the heavenly bodies ; their concern was to ‘ save the phenomena , ’ that is , give a close approximation of where the heavenly bodies would be at a given point in time .
And in an age without professional astronomers , let alone the telescope , Ptolemy did a good job plotting the courses of the heavenly bodies .
Not all Greek astronomical ideas followed this geocentric system .
Pythagoreans suggested that the earth moved around a central fire ( not the sun ) .
Archimedes wrote that Aristarchus of Samos actually proposed that the earth rotated daily and revolved around the sun . [ 3 ]
During the European Middle Ages , the Islamic world was the center of astronomical thought and activity .
During the ninth century several aspects of Ptolemy ’s solar theory were recalculated .
Ibn al - Haytham in the tenth - eleventh century wrote a scathing critique of Ptolemy ’s work : “ Ptolemy assumed an arrangement that cannot exist , and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement , for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist ” ( quoted in Rosen 1984 , 174 ) .
Swerdlow and Neugebauer ( 46 –48 ) stressed that the thirteenth - century Maragha school was also important in finding errors and correcting Ptolemy : “ The method of the Maragha planetary models was to break up the equant motion in Ptolemy ’s models into two or more components of uniform circular motion , physically the uniform rotation of spheres , that together control the direction and distance of the center of the epicycle , so that it comes to lie in nearly the same position it would have in Ptolemy ’s model , and always moves uniformly with respect to the equant . ”
They found that Copernicus used devices that had been developed by the Maragha astronomers Nasir al - Din Tusi ( 1201 - 1274 ) , Muayyad al - Din al - Urdi ( d. 1266 ) , Qutb al - Din al - Shirazi ( 1236-1311 ) , and Ibn al - Shatir ( 1304–1375 ) .
In addition , Ragep , 2005 , has shown that a theory for the inner planets presented by Regiomontanus that enabled Copernicus to convert the planets to eccentric models had been developed by the fifteenth - century , Samarqand - trained astronomer ali Qushji ( 1403 –1474 ) . [ 4 ]
Renaissance humanism did not necessarily promote natural philosophy , but its emphasis on mastery of classical languages and texts had the side effect of promoting the sciences .
Georg Peurbach ( 1423 –1461 ) and ( Johannes Müller ) Regiomontanus ( 1436 –1476 ) studied Greek for the purpose of producing an outline of Ptolemaic astronomy .
By the time Regiomontanus finished the work in 1463 , it was an important commentary on the Almagest as well , pointing out , for example , that Ptolemy ’s lunar theory did not accord with observations .
He noted that Ptolemy showed the moon to be at various times twice as far from the earth as at other times , which should make the moon appear twice as big .
At the time , moreover , there was active debate over Ptolemy ’s deviations from Aristotle ’s requirement of uniform circular motion .
2.2 The Commentariolus
It is impossible to date when Copernicus first began to espouse the heliocentric theory .
Had he done so during his lecture in Rome , such a radical theory would have occasioned comment , but there was none , so it is likely that he adopted this theory after 1500 .
Further , Corvinus , who helped him print his Latin translation in 1508 – 09 , expressed admiration for his knowledge of astronomy , so that Copernicus ’s concept may have still been traditional at this point .
His first heliocentric writing was his Commentariolus .
It was a small manuscript that was circulated but never printed .
We do not know when he wrote this , but a professor in Cracow cataloged his books in 1514 and made reference to a “ manuscript of six leaves expounding the theory of an author who asserts that the earth moves while the sun stands still ” ( Rosen , 1971 , 343 ; MW 75 ) .
Thus , Copernicus probably adopted the heliocentric theory sometime between 1508 and 1514 .
Rosen ( 1971 , 345 ) suggested that Copernicus ’s “ interest in determining planetary positions in 1512 – 1514 may reasonably be linked with his decisions to leave his uncle ’s episcopal palace in 1510 and to build his own outdoor observatory in 1513 . ”
In other words , it was the result of a period of intense concentration on cosmology that was facilitated by his leaving his uncle and the attendant focus on church politics and medicine .
It is impossible to know exactly why Copernicus began to espouse the heliocentric cosmology .
Despite his importance in the history of philosophy , there is a paucity of primary sources on Copernicus .
His only astronomical writings were the Commentariolus , the Letter against Werner , and On the Revolutions ; he published his translation of Theophylactus ’s letters and wrote the various versions of his treatise on coinage ; other writings relate to diocesan business , as do most of the few letters that survive .
Sadly , the biography by Rheticus , which should have provided scholars with an enormous amount of information , has been lost .
Therefore , many of the answers to the most interesting questions about Copernicus ’s ideas and works have been the result of conjecture and inference , and we can only guess why Copernicus adopted the heliocentric system .
Most scholars believe that the reason Copernicus rejected Ptolemaic cosmology was because of Ptolemy ’s equant .
[ 5 ]
They assume this because of what Copernicus wrote in the Commentariolus :
Yet the widespread [ planetary theories ] , advanced by Ptolemy and most other [ astronomers ] , although consistent with the numerical [ data ] , seemed likewise to present no small difficulty .
For these theories were not adequate unless they also conceived certain equalizing circles , which made the planet appear to move at all times with uniform velocity neither on its deferent sphere nor about its own [ epicycle ’s ] center …
Therefore , having become aware of these [ defects ] , I often considered whether there could perhaps be found a more reasonable arrangement of circles , from which every apparent irregularity would be derived while everything in itself would move uniformly , as is required by the rule of perfect motion .
( MW 81 ) .
Goddu ( 381 –84 ) has plausibly maintained that while the initial motivation for Copernicus was dissatisfaction with the equant , that dissatisfaction may have impelled him to observe other violations of uniform circular motion , and those observations , not the rejection of the equant by itself , led to the heliocentric theory .
Blumenberg ( 254 ) has pointed out that the mobility of the earth may have been reinforced by the similarity of its spherical shape to those of the heavenly bodies .
As the rejection of the equant suggests a return to the Aristotelian demand for true uniform circular motion of the heavenly bodies , it is unlikely that Copernicus adopted the heliocentric model because philosophies popular among Renaissance humanists like Neoplatonism and Hermetism compelled him in that direction . [ 6 ]
Nor should we attribute Copernicus ’s desire for uniform circular motions to an aesthetic need , for this idea was philosophical not aesthetic , and Copernicus ’s replacing the equant with epicyclets made his system more complex than Ptolemy ’s .
Most importantly , we should bear in mind what Swerdlow and Neugebauer ( 59 ) asserted :
Copernicus arrived at the heliocentric theory by a careful analysis of planetary models – and as far as is known , he was the only person of his age to do so – and if he chose to adopt it , he did so on the basis of an equally careful analysis .
In the Commentariolus Copernicus listed assumptions that he believed solved the problems of ancient astronomy .
He stated that the earth is only the center of gravity and center of the moon ’s orbit ; that all the spheres encircle the sun , which is close to the center of the universe ; that the universe is much larger than previously assumed , and the earth ’s distance to the sun is a small fraction of the size of the universe ; that the apparent motion of the heavens and the sun is created by the motion of the earth ; and that the apparent retrograde motion of the planets is created by the earth ’s motion .
Although the Copernican model maintained epicycles moving along the deferrent , which explained retrograde motion in the Ptolemaic model , Copernicus correctly explained that the retrograde motion of the planets was only apparent not real , and its appearance was due to the fact that the observers were not at rest in the center .
The work dealt very briefly with the order of the planets ( Mercury , Venus , earth , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn , the only planets that could be observed with the naked eye ) , the triple motion of the earth ( the daily rotation , the annual revolution of its center , and the annual revolution of its inclination ) that causes the sun to seem to be in motion , the motions of the equinoxes , the revolution of the moon around the earth , and the revolution of the five planets around the sun .
2.3 On the Revolutions
The Commentariolus was only intended as an introduction to Copernicus ’s ideas , and he wrote “ the mathematical demonstrations intended for my larger work should be omitted for brevity ’s sake … ” ( MW 82 ) .
In a sense it was an announcement of the greater work that Copernicus had begun .
The Commentariolus was never published during Copernicus ’s lifetime , but he sent manuscript copies to various astronomers and philosophers .
He received some discouragement because the heliocentric system seemed to disagree with the Bible , but mostly he was encouraged .
Although Copernicus ’s involvement with official attempts to reform the calendar was limited to a no longer extant letter , that endeavor made a new , serious astronomical theory welcome .
Fear of the reaction of ecclesiastical authorities was probably the least of the reasons why he delayed publishing his book .
[ 7 ]
The most important reasons for the delay was that the larger work required both astronomical observations and intricate mathematical proofs .
His administrative duties certainly interfered with both the research and the writing .
He was unable to make the regular observations that he needed and Frombork , which was often fogged in , was not a good place for those observations .
Moreover , as Gingerich ( 1993 , 37 ) pointed out ,
[ Copernicus ] was far from the major international centers of printing that could profitably handle a book as large and technical as De revolutionibus .
On the other [ hand ] , his manuscript was still full of numerical inconsistencies , and he knew very well that he had not taken complete advantage of the opportunities that the heliocentric viewpoint offered …
Furthermore , Copernicus was far from academic centers , thereby lacking the stimulation of technically trained colleagues with whom he could discuss his work .
The manuscript of On the Revolutions was basically complete when Rheticus came to visit him in 1539 .
The work comprised six books .
The first book , the best known , discussed what came to be known as the Copernican theory and what is Copernicus ’s most important contribution to astronomy , the heliocentric universe ( although in Copernicus ’s model , the sun is not truly in the center ) .
Book 1 set out the order of the heavenly bodies about the sun : “ [ The sphere of the fixed stars ] is followed by the first of the planets , Saturn , which completes its circuit in 30 years .
After Saturn , Jupiter accomplishes its revolution in 12 years .
The Mars revolves in 2 years .
The annual revolution takes the series ’ fourth place , which contains the earth … together with the lunar sphere as an epicycle .
In the fifth place Venus returns in 9 months .
Lastly , the sixth place is held by Mercury , which revolves in a period of 80 days ” ( Revolutions , 21 – 22 ) .
This established a relationship between the order of the planets and their periods , and it made a unified system .
This may be the most important argument in favor of the heliocentric model as Copernicus described it . [ 8 ]
It was far superior to Ptolemy ’s model , which had the planets revolving around the earth so that the sun , Mercury , and Venus all had the same annual revolution .
In book 1 Copernicus also insisted that the movements of all bodies must be circular and uniform , and noted that the reason they may appear nonuniform to us is “ either that their circles have poles different [ from the earth ’s ] or that the earth is not at the center of the circles on which they revolve ” ( Revolutions , 11 ) .
Particularly notable for Copernicus was that in Ptolemy ’s model the sun , the moon , and the five planets seemed ironically to have different motions from the other heavenly bodies and it made more sense for the small earth to move than the immense heavens .
But the fact that Copernicus turned the earth into a planet did not cause him to reject Aristotelian physics , for he maintained that “ land and water together press upon a single center of gravity ; that the earth has no other center of magnitude ; that , since earth is heavier , its gaps are filled with water … ” ( Revolutions , 10 ) .
As Aristotle had asserted , the earth was the center toward which the physical elements gravitate .
This was a problem for Copernicus ’s model , because if the earth was no longer the center , why should elements gravitate toward it ?
The second book of On the Revolutions elaborated the concepts in the first book ; book 3 dealt with the precession of the equinoxes and solar theory ; book 4 dealt with the moon ’s motions ; book 5 dealt with the planetary longitude and book 6 with latitude . [ 9 ]
Copernicus depended very much on Ptolemy ’s observations , and there was little new in his mathematics .
He was most successful in his work on planetary longitude , which , as Swerdlow and Neugebauer ( 77 ) commented , was “ Copernicus ’s most admirable , and most demanding , accomplishment …
It was above all the decision to derive new elements for the planets that delayed for nearly half a lifetime Copernicus ’s continuation of his work – nearly twenty years devoted to observation and then several more to the most tedious kind of computation – and the result was recognized by his contemporaries as the equal of Ptolemy ’s accomplishment , which was surely the highest praise for an astronomer . ”
Surprisingly , given that the elimination of the equant was so important in the Commentariolus , Copernicus did not mention it in book 1 , but he sought to replace it with an epicyclet throughout On the Revolutions .
Nevertheless , he did write in book 5 when describing the motion of Mercury :
… the ancients allowed the epicycle to move uniformly only around the equant ’s center .
This procedure was in gross conflict with the true center [ of the epicycle ’s motion ] , its relative [ distances ] , and the prior centers of both [ other circles ]
… However , in order that this last planet too may be rescued from the affronts and pretenses of its detractors , and that its uniform motion , no less than that of the other aforementioned planets , may be revealed in relation to the earth ’s motion , I shall attribute to it too , [ as the circle mounted ] on its eccentric , an eccentric instead of the epicycle accepted in antiquity ( Revolutions , 278–79 ) .
2.4 Rheticus and the Narratio prima
Although Copernicus received encouragement to publish his book from his close friend , the bishop of Chelmo Tiedemann Giese ( 1480 –1550 ) , and from the cardinal of Capua Nicholas Schönberg ( 1472 –1537 ) , it was the arrival of Georg Joachim Rheticus in Frombork that solved his needs for a supportive and stimulating colleague in mathematics and astronomy and for access to an appropriate printer .
Rheticus was a professor of mathematics at the University of Wittenberg , a major center for the student of mathematics as well as for Lutheran theology .
In 1538 Rheticus took a leave of absence to visit several famous scholars in the fields of astronomy and mathematics .
It is not known how Rheticus learned about Copernicus ’s theory ; he may have been convinced to visit Copernicus by one of the earlier scholars he had visited , Johann Schöner , though , as Swerdlow and Neugebauer ( 16 ) noted , by “ the early 1530 ’s knowledge of Copernicus ’s new theory was circulating in Europe , even reaching the high and learned circles of the Vatican . ”
Rheticus brought with him some mathematical and astronomical volumes , which both provided Copernicus with some important material and showed him the quality of the mathematical printing available in the German centers of publishing . [ 10 ]
Rheticus ’s present of the 1533 edition of Regiomontanus ’s On all Kinds of Triangles ( De triangulis omnimodis ) , for example , convinced Copernicus to revise his section on trigonometry .
But Rheticus was particularly interested in showing Copernicus the work of the Nuremberg publisher Johann Petreius as a possible publisher of Copernicus ’s volume .
Swerdlow and Neugebauer ( 25 ) plausibly suggested that “ Petreius was offering to publish Copernicus ’s work , if not advertising by this notice that he was already committed to do so . ”
Rheticus wrote the Narratio prima in 1540 , an introduction to the theories of Copernicus , which was published and circulated .
This further encouraged Copernicus to publish his Revolutions , which he had been working on since he published the Commentariolus .
The Narratio prima was written in 1539 and took the form of a letter to Johann Schöner announcing Copernicus ’s findings and describing the contents of the Revolutions .
He dealt with such topics as the motions of the fixed stars , the tropical year , the obliquity of the ecliptic , the problems resulting from the motion of the sun , the motions of the earth and the other planets , librations , longitude in the other five planets , and the apparent deviation of the planets from the ecliptic .
He asserted that the heliocentric universe should have been adopted because it better accounted for such phenomena as the precession of the equinoxes and the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic ; it resulted in a diminution of the eccentricity of the sun ; the sun was the center of the deferents of the planets ; it allowed the circles in the universe to revolve uniformly and regularly ; it satisfied appearances more readily with fewer explanations necessary ; it united all the spheres into one system .
Rheticus added astrological predictions and number mysticism , which were absent from Copernicus ’s work .
The Narratio prima was printed in 1540 in Gdansk ( then Danzig ) ; thus , it was the first printed description of the Copernican thesis .
Rheticus sent a copy to Achilles Pirmin Gasser of Feldkirch , his hometown in modern - day Austria , and Gasser wrote a foreword that was published with a second edition that was produced in 1541 in Basel .
It was published again in 1596 as an appendix to the first edition of Johannes Kepler ’s Mysterium cosmographicum ( Secret of the Universe ) , the first completely Copernican work by an adherent since the publications by Copernicus and Rheticus .
2.5 Printing On the Revolutions and Osiander ’s Preface
The publication of Rheticus ’s Narratio prima did not create a big stir against the heliocentric thesis , and so Copernicus decided to publish On the Revolutions .
He added a dedication to Pope Paul III ( r. 1534 –1549 ) , probably for political reasons , in which he expressed his hesitancy about publishing the work and the reasons he finally decided to publish it .
He gave credit to Schönberg and Giese for encouraging him to publish and omitted mention of Rheticus , but it would have been insulting to the pope during the tense period of the Reformation to give credit to a Protestant minister . [ 11 ]
He dismissed critics who might have claimed that it was against the Bible by giving the example of the fourth - century Christian apologist Lactantius , who had rejected the spherical shape of the earth , and by asserting , “ Astronomy is written for astronomers ” ( Revolutions , 5 ) . [ 12 ]
In other words , theologians should not meddle with it .
He pointed to the difficulty of calendar reform because the motions of the heavenly bodies were inadequately known .
And he called attention to the fact that “ if the motions of the other planets are correlated with the orbiting of the earth , and are computed for the revolution of each planet , not only do their phenomena follow therefrom but also the order and size of all the planets and spheres , and heaven itself is so linked together that in no portion of it can anything be shifted without disrupting the remaining parts and the universe as a whole ” ( Revolutions , 5 ) .
Rheticus returned to Wittenberg in 1541 and the following year received another leave of absence , at which time he took the manuscript of the Revolutions to Petreius for publishing in Nuremberg .
Rheticus oversaw the printing of most of the text .
However , Rheticus was forced to leave Nuremberg later that year because he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Leipzig .
He left the rest of the management of printing the Revolutions to Andrew Osiander ( 1498 –1552 ) , a Lutheran minister who was also interested in mathematics and astronomy .
Though he saw the project through , Osiander appended an anonymous preface to the work .
In it he claimed that Copernicus was offering a hypothesis , not a true account of the working of the heavens : “ Since he [ the astronomer ] cannot in any way attain to the true causes , he will adopt whatever suppositions enable the motions to be computed correctly from the principles of geometry for the future as well as for the past … these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable ” ( Revolutions , xvi ) .
This clearly contradicted the body of the work .
Both Rheticus and Giese protested , and Rheticus crossed it out in his copy .
2.6 Sixteenth Century Reactions to On the Revolutions
Copernicus ’s fame and book made its way across Europe over the next fifty years , and a second edition was brought out in 1566 . [ 13 ]
As Gingerich ’s census of the extant copies showed , the book was read and commented on by astronomers .
( For a fuller discussion of reactions , see Omodeo . )
Gingerich ( 2004 , 55 ) noted “ the majority of sixteenth - century astronomers thought eliminating the equant was Copernicus ’ big achievement . ”
While Martin Luther may have made negative comments about Copernicus because the idea of the heliocentric universe seemed to contradict the Bible , [ 14 ] Philip Melanchthon ( 1497 –1560 ) , who presided over the curriculum at the University of Wittenberg , eventually accepted the importance of teaching Copernicus ’s ideas , perhaps because Osiander ’s preface made the work more palatable .
His son - in - law Caspar Peucer ( 1525 -1602 ) taught astronomy there and began teaching Copernicus ’s work .
As a result , the University of Wittenberg became a center where Copernicus ’s work was studied .
But Rheticus was the only Wittenberg scholar who accepted the heliocentric idea .
Robert Westman ( 1975a , 166–67 ; 2011 , chap .
5 ) suggested that there was a ‘ Wittenberg Interpretation ’ : astronomers appreciated and adopted some of Copernicus ’s mathematical models but rejected his cosmology , and some were pleased with his replacement of the equant by epicyclets .
One of these was Erasmus Reinhold ( 1511 –1553 ) , a leading astronomer at Wittenberg who became dean and rector .
He produced a new set of planetary tables from Copernicus ’s work , the Prutenic Tables .
Although , as Gingerich ( 1993 , 232 ) pointed out , “ there was relatively little to distinguish between the accuracy of the Alfonsine Tables and the Prutenic Tables , ” the latter were more widely adopted ; Gingerich plausibly suggested that the fact that the Prutenic Tables more accurately predicted a conjunction between Jupiter and Saturn in 1563 made the difference .
Reinhold did not accept the heliocentric theory , but he admired the elimination of the equant .
The Prutenic Tables excited interest in Copernicus ’s work .
Tycho Brahe ( 1546–1601 ) was the greatest astronomical observer before the invention of the telescope .
He called Copernicus a ‘ second Ptolemy ’ ( quoted in Westman 1975 , 307 ) and appreciated both the elimination of the equant and the creation of a planetary system .
But Tycho could not adopt the Copernican system , partly for the religious reason that it went against what the Bible seemed to preach .
He , therefore , adopted a compromise , the ‘ geoheliostatic ’ system in which the two inner planets revolved around the sun and that system along with the rest of the planets revolved around the earth .
Among Catholics , Christoph Clavius ( 1537 –1612 ) was the leading astronomer in the sixteenth century .
A Jesuit himself , he incorporated astronomy into the Jesuit curriculum and was the principal scholar behind the creation of the Gregorian calendar .
Like the Wittenberg astronomers , Clavius adopted Copernican mathematical models when he felt them superior , but he believed that Ptolemy ’s cosmology – both his ordering of the planets and his use of the equant – was correct .
Pope Clement VII ( r. 1523 –1534 ) had reacted favorably to a talk about Copernicus ’s theories , rewarding the speaker with a rare manuscript .
There is no indication of how Pope Paul III , to whom On the Revolutions was dedicated reacted ; however , a trusted advisor , Bartolomeo Spina of Pisa ( 1474–1546 ) intended to condemn it but fell ill and died before his plan was carried out ( see Rosen , 1975 ) .
Thus , in 1600 there was no official Catholic position on the Copernican system , and it was certainly not a heresy .
When Giordano Bruno ( 1548 –1600 ) was burned at the stake as a heretic , it had nothing to do with his writings in support of Copernican cosmology , and this is clearly shown in Finocchiaro ’s reconstruction of the accusations against Bruno ( see also Blumenberg ’s part 3 , chapter 5 , titled “ Not a Martyr for Copernicanism : Giordano Bruno ” ) .
Michael Maestlin ( 1550 –1631 ) of the University of Tübingen was the earliest astronomer after Rheticus to adopt Copernicus ’s heliocentricism .
Although he wrote a popular textbook that was geocentric , he taught his students that the heliocentric system was superior .
He also rejected Osiander ’s preface .
Maestlin ’s pupil Johannes Kepler wrote the first book since the publication of On the Revolutions that was openly heliocentric in its orientation , the Mysterium cosmographicum ( Secret of the Universe ) .
And , of course , Kepler eventually built on Copernicus ’s work to create a much more accurate description of the solar system .
The tarpaulin covers have been meticulously erected , but they can't completely mask the brutality of the slaughter unfolding below .
Even from the clifftop , it is possible to hear the hunters ' voices and the thrashing of tail fins as their prey make a final , fruitless bid for freedom .
Occasionally a hunter emerges into the gaps between the covers , grimacing as he plunges his knife into the water .
Minutes earlier the sea around him was emerald green .
Now it is turning a deep crimson , the morning air tainted with the stench of freshly drawn mammal blood .
The gruesome spectacle of dolphins being slaughtered for profit has returned to Taiji , just as international condemnation of the Japanese town 's annual cull reaches a crescendo .
At least 100 bottlenose dolphins and 50 pilot whales have been taken in the first hunt of the season , which began on 1 September .
Over the next six months the town 's fishermen will catch about 2,300 of Japan 's annual quota of 20,000 dolphins .
The meat from a single animal fetches up to 50,000 yen ( £ 330 ) , but aquariums are prepared to pay up to £ 90,000 for certain types .
In a typical hunt the fishermen pursue pods of dolphins across open seas , banging metal poles together beneath the water to confuse their hypersensitive sonar .
The exhausted animals are driven into a large cove sealed off by nets to stop them escaping and dragged backwards into secluded inlets the following morning to be butchered with knives and spears .
They are then loaded on to boats and taken to the quayside to be cut up in a warehouse , the fishermen 's work hidden from the outside by heavy shutters .
Taiji officials said all the pilot whales caught on this expedition had been killed and their meat put on the market , but added that half of the bottlenose catch would be sold to aquariums and the remainder " set free " , in an apparent attempt to mollify international opinion .
It is impossible to verify those claims .
The bottlenose dolphins were still penned in close to the shoreline more than 24 hours after they had been captured .
Guardian photographs taken covertly during the cull show what appears to be a young bottlenose floating , motionless and belly up , just beyond the slaughter zone .
What is clear is that a siege mentality has taken hold in Taiji , an isolated town of 3,500 on the Pacific coast of Wakayama prefecture .
Tensions have been rising and the culls conducted in near - secrecy since 2003 , when two members of the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd released several dolphins that were being kept in an enclosure ready to be slaughtered .
During our visit we were followed at almost every turn , ordered not to take photographs and questioned by the police , who seem to view every foreign visitor as a potential hunt saboteur .
None of the residents who agreed to talk would reveal their names , and requests for comments from the town office were ignored .
Criticism of the dolphin hunts intensified this summer with the release of the award - winning US documentary The Cove , whose makers used remote - controlled helicopters and hidden underwater cameras to record the hunters at work .
The film , with its graphic footage of the dolphin slaughter , sparked outrage after its release in the US and Australia .
Last month councillors in the Australian coastal town of Broome suspended its 28 - year sister - city relationship with Taiji after receiving thousands of emails protesting at the culls .
Taiji is regarded as the spiritual home of Japan 's whaling industry .
The first hunts took place in the early 1600s , according to the town 's whaling museum , but the industry went into decline after the introduction of a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986 .
The town , a six - hour train ride from Tokyo , is dotted with restaurants serving whale and dolphin sashimi and cetacean iconography appears on everything from the pavements and bridge balustrades to road tunnels and a wind turbine .
Yet in other respects it does not have the feel of a town that takes pride in its traditions .
Last week 's pilot whale cull was conducted in inlets shielded on three sides by steep cliffs and dense undergrowth to deter campaigners and journalists .
Barriers have been hastily erected along coastal paths that run through publicly owned land .
Local fishermen point out that the dolphins and other small cetaceans are not covered by the whaling moratorium .
What critics regard as the senseless slaughter of intelligent creatures they see as a legitimate exercise in pest control , blaming dolphins for decimating fish stocks .
" People say dolphins are cute and smart , but some regions have a tradition of eating dolphin meat , " said Toshinori Uoya , a fisheries official .
" Dolphin - killing may be bad for our international image , but we can't just issue an order for it to stop . "
The hero of the film is Ric O'Barry , a 69 - year - old activist who has waged a one - man campaign against Taiji 's dolphin culls for more than a decade .
" We have to keep Taiji in the news , " said O'Barry , who trained dolphins for the 1960s TV series Flipper before devoting himself to their conservation .
" There is an international tsunami of attention .
" I 've been working with dolphins for most of my life .
I watched them give birth .
I 've nursed them back to health .
When I see what happens in this cove in Taiji , I want to do something about it . "
To many Taiji residents , O'Barry 's comments typify the hypocrisy they say lies at the heart of mounting fury at their centuries - old tradition of killing whales and dolphins .
" I think we are the victims of a form of racism , " said one , as we watched the pilot whales being herded out of sight to be killed .
" Westerners slaughter cattle and other animals in the most inhumane ways imaginable , but no one says a word .
Why is it that only Japan gets this kind of treatment ? "
The Cove will be released in the UK on 23 October .
As the unemployment rate topped 25 % and General Motors planned to cut more jobs in this long - struggling auto town , voters decided to focus their anger on one person : Mayor Donald J. Williamson .
More than 17,000 residents signed a petition demanding his recall , citing waste , corruption , mismanagement and sundry other complaints .
Williamson resigned 10 days before the vote .
“ He made people so mad , ” said Eric Mays , a retired GM worker who led an earlier effort to recall Williamson that failed .
“ He had to go . ”

Fueled by the recession , voters nationwide are recalling local leaders , including mayors , school board members , county officials and sheriffs .
Although there is no official tally of recall efforts , the website Ballotpedia : Recall reports at least 52 local campaigns this year -- up from the 24 last year , it said .
At least 13 elected officials this year have resigned , decided not to run for reelection or been recalled , according to the website .
“ There was so much anger toward big government and , right or wrong , we at the local level are the direct target of it , ” said County Commissioner Kevin W. Stufflebean of Coos County , Ore. , who successfully beat back a recall attempt this year .

In May , voters in Tuolumne County , Calif. , recalled all five board members of the Big Oak Flat - Groveland Unified School District , prompted by the firing of a popular teacher and by claims that it had failed to account for how it had spent $ 16 million in bond revenue .
In Kimberly , Idaho , voters started a petition drive to recall the mayor and two council members after they backed a 50 % increase in utility fees to fund infrastructure projects .
The petition drive fell short , and law enforcement officials are investigating whether local officials tampered with the process .
A mayoral recall vote was set for this fall in Toledo , Ohio -- despite Mayor Carty Finkbeiner ’s announcement July 12 that he would n’t seek reelection .
But this week , the state ’s highest court said the signatures should be thrown out because the recall petition form left out a key sentence .
The news was a blow to the bipartisan group of business owners who organized the Take Back Toledo campaign , which says the mayor drove away business opportunities for the city , spent money on landscaping and built ornate “ welcome ” signs -- while laying off scores of city workers and cutting back on public services .
Recall organizers had gone forward despite the mayor ’s announcement .
“ I did n’t think it was my decision to countermand what 45,000 people wanted to be done , ” Tom Schlachter , a real estate developer and Take Back Toledo founder , told the Toledo Blade .
Recalling officials is considered a relatively drastic form of democracy .
Instead of challenging an official ’s stance on specific issues , such as tax hikes or land use , “ voters are condemning all of their policies , ” said Phyllis Myers , head of State Resource Strategies , a Washington - based consultant on state and local ballot measures .

“ It ’s rare that you have the public be that angry with an elected official , ” Myers said .
The root of all this resentment is usually money .
Scores of recall efforts were launched during the Great Depression .
More recently , in California ’s successful recall of Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 , voters were furious at the state ’s mounting deficit and electricity crisis , which tripled some energy bills .
With the recession continuing to hurt city budgets , “ these early recalls could be the beginning of a deluge of local political battles , ” said Joe Mathews , a senior fellow at New America Foundation and former Los Angeles Times reporter .

Few municipalities have as much experience mobilizing the electorate around a City Hall recall as Flint .
The city pushed to recall two mayors in seven years .
Williamson ’s predecessor was recalled in 2002 over economic issues .
But Williamson , now 75 , soon became a divisive figure in the town that GM built .
The multimillionaire was elected in 2003 after giving stump speeches about how he earned his fortune from making truck - bed liners -- despite a sixth - grade education and having serving prison time for several business scams .
As mayor , he was combative with the local media and critics .
“ He ’d been pushing people and pushing people ’s patience for a long time , ” Mays said .
But the city ’s deepening problems eventually seemed to boost mere distaste into a drive for voter revenge .
Recall organizers rallied around Williamson ’s habit of driving around town in city vehicles with police lights flashing , and his appointment of a father - son duo to run Flint ’s police department while federal authorities were investigating the pair for alleged financial improprieties .
Last year , residents learned the city had a deficit of more than $ 8 million , mostly due to lawsuits against the mayor .

Williamson , who did not return calls for comment , and his supporters scoffed at the recall effort , saying voters were recall - crazy :
In addition to the mayor , a councilwoman faced a recall attempt , as did three board of education members in nearby Westwood Heights School District .
As the campaign reached its peak in February , Williamson unexpectedly announced his retirement , blaming health problems .
Despite his health , Williamson recently reaffirmed plans to run for governor .
Some political observers note that there can be a payoff in these campaigns with voters feeling empowered for the first time in years .
In June , Don Plusquellic , who has been mayor of the struggling blue - collar town of Akron , Ohio , since 1987 , overwhelmingly defeated a recall initiative , which cost the city $ 175,000 .
Among other things , the recall attempt focused on Plusquellic ’s plans to lease the city ’s sewer district to pay for college scholarships and on his proposed income - tax hike .

Days after the election results were released , dozens of people stopped by the county board of elections office and filed campaign paperwork for the September primary election .
So far , 56 residents are vying for the 10 city council seats and three at - large positions .
“ I ’ve been involved in local politics for decades and I ’ve never seen anything like this , ” said attorney Warner Mendenhall , who spearheaded the mayoral recall effort .
“ People are energized .
They ’re ready for a fight . ”
But more often than not , the months of campaigning leave behind a trail of bad feelings that underscore the personal nature of local politics .
The recall campaign in Coos County was sparked last year after the three - member board of commissioners cut the county ’s 40 - person roads department by 55 % .
The board had to reduce its $ 4 - million budget by a quarter .

Times had been tough in the county , a rural area of 60,000 on Oregon ’s northwest coast .
Unemployment is at 14 % and the timber industry has been hit hard by the real estate market ’s collapse .
“ It was n’t like I wanted to cut those jobs .
But that did n’t matter , ” said Stufflebean , who oversaw transportation issues for the board .
The news infuriated voters .
Residents drove by Stufflebean ’s home , taking pictures of him and his family and posting the images online along with nasty comments .
His wife was yelled at while grocery shopping .
His son , who attends high school with the children of some of the laid - off county road workers , tried to shrug off criticism about his father .
Stufflebean refused to change his position , and won the recall vote in May 55 % to 45 % .
The campaign against the recall drained his savings .
He and his wife recently filed for bankruptcy .

“ I ’ve gotten called a lot of names , ” said Stufflebean , a former city councilman who also used to work for the state ’s human services department .
“ But this ?
For my family and myself , this was one of the most horrific experiences of our lives . ”

A video promoting tourism in Denmark has been removed from YouTube after complaints it promoted promiscuity .
The three - minute clip shows a young blonde woman , trying to find a man whom she had a one night stand with , who fathered her child " August " .
VisitDenmark 's manager , Dorte Kiilerich said the film was supposed to be a " nice and sweet story of a woman " .
But Denmark 's Economy Minister , Lene Espersen , said it " was not a very well - thought - out picture of the country " .
In the advert , the woman says - in English - that she was " trying to find August 's father " .
" We met one night a year and a half ago when you were on vacation here in Denmark .
" We met ... and then decided to have a drink and , yeah , it 's really embarrassing but it 's more or less what I remember .
" I do n't remember where you 're from or even your name . "
' Tasteless '
Critics says the video implied that along with traditional tourism , Denmark was a place to go to have unprotected sex with strangers .
One Danish newspaper , Ekstra Bladet , labelled it " grotesque " and a " waste of taxpayers ' money " .
The video also prompted a slew of angry comments , with one user saying it was a " tasteless , tactless way of attracting attention " .
Ms Kiilerich said she regretted any offence the video may have caused , but the intent had been to tell " a nice and sweet story about a grown - up woman who lives in a free society and accepts the consequences of her actions " .
The YouTube clip received more than 800,000 hits and although the official video has been removed , copies have been spreading across YouTube .
It has also spawned numerous parodies , with men from across the world saying they were " not bimbos " and trying to find the mother of their child .
In Ancient times , they sought out ways to cut back on crime .
Instead of letting the criminals sit in a jail cell , like today , they would use different torture devices .
These devices came in all shapes and sizes and were meant to scare other would - be criminals into not doing the crimes committed by the person being tortured .
Let ’s check these weird torture methods .
10 . The Brazen Bull
This device was designed in Greece by Perillos of Athens .
He was a brass founder and he cast the shape of a hollow bull with a door on the side .
This condemned person was shut in the bull .
There was a fire lit underneath the device and because it was brass it became yellow hot , which would cause the person to roast to death .
It was configured with tubes and stops , so when the person was screaming it would sound like the bull was raging .
9 . The Breaking Wheel
This wheel of torture was used to kill criminals and it did that very slowly .
This device was a large wagon wheel .
The criminal would be tied to the wheel , where the punisher would proceed to use a hammer to break the bones of the other person .
Once that was completed , they were left there to die and even the birds would peck at their flesh until death was complete .
8. The Rack
This device is an oblong rectangle with a wooden frame .
It was raised from the ground with a roller either at one end or at both ends .
One end had a fixed bar , where the feet were locked onto it , and the other end had a moveable bar , where the hands were tied to it .
It had a lever that was used as the interrogation progressed .
It was on a lever and pulley system that would eventually cause the joints of the person being tortured to dislocate and then separate .
Eventually , the muscle fibers user bin , ligaments , and cartilage would break separating the limbs from the body of the condemned .
7. Judas Cradle
This torture device is a pyramid - shaped seat .
The victim is placed on top of it , with the point inserted into an orifice , then they are very slowly lowered onto it .
The condemned was usually naked in order to add to their humiliation .
This device was thought to stretch the orifice or to slowly impale the person .
The stretching of the orifice would cause pain , rips , and tears , which would eventually cause death .
6. Coffin Torture
This device was used in the Middle Ages .
The condemned would be placed in the metal coffin and left there for the appropriate amount of time .
Depending on the crime , the person could be left in there to die , while animals ate their flesh or they would be placed on public display , which would cause their death .
The people that would surround the person in the coffin would throw rocks and poke the person with objects until they finally became deceased .
Iron Maiden
This iron cabinet with a hinged front was made to be a tall upright cabinet that would enclose a human being .
It would have a small opening , which was closeable , so the interrogator would be able to open and close it at their will .
They would then poke the bodies of the person with a sharp object .
They would use knives , spikes , or nails and the person inside was forced to remain standing in one position , ultimately causing their demise .

4. The Knee Splitter
The whole purpose of this device was to make a person ’s knees useless .
It was used mainly during the Inquisitional period of time .
This device was faceted with spikes , from three to twenty of them , and depending on the crime committed , depending on the number used .
IT had a handle the torturer would use to close the device .
The spikes would mutilate the skin and begin to crush the knee .
They would also use the device on elbows , arms and the lower legs .
There were even instances that they would heat the device to cause a maximum amount of pain .
Death was n’t a result of this device , but it the person refused to cooperate they would use other means .
3. Heretic`s Fork
This device was used during the Spanish Inquisition .
It has two forks at opposing ends of a metal rod .
One of the forks would be placed under the chin , piercing the skin , and the other end would be piercing the flesh in the upper chest .
It did n’t puncture any vital organs , so death would not take place during the use of this method , but it made talking and neck movements impossible .
While wearing this device a person ’s hands would be tied behind their backs , so they could not escape it .
It would harm the person ’s neck and , oftentimes , spread diseases .
2. Saw Torture
This method was used to torture and kill the condemned person , which were typically accused of witchery , adultery , murder , blasphemy , or theft .
The accused was hung upside down .
This slowed down the blood loss by forcing the blood to the brain and it humiliated the person .
This type of torture could last for several hours .
Some of the victims would be cut completely in half , while some would only be cut up to their abdomen in order to prolong their deaths .
1. Thumbscrew
This was used to get a confession from the offenders .
The fingers of the person were placed in the device and crushed by the torturer turning the handle on the top .
It could last for a very long time and it was very painful .
This was also used to crush a person ’s toes .
They even made bigger versions of this device used to crush feet , knees , elbows and even heads .
The Barkhausen Stability Criterion is simple , intuitive , and wrong .
During the study of the phase margin of linear systems , this criterion is often suggested by students grasping for an intuitive understanding of stability .
Unfortunately , although counterexamples are easy to provide , I do not know of a satisfying disproof to the Barkhausen Stability Criterion that combats this intuition .
Some textbooks even state the Barkhausen Stability Criterion ( although none refer to it by name ) .
In their introduction of the Nyquist Stability Criterion , Chestnut and Meyer state
If in a closed - loop control system with sinusoidal excitation the feedback signal from the controlled variable is in phase and is equal or greater in magnitude to the reference input at any one frequency , the system is unstable .[ 3 , page 142 ]
The history of the Barkhausen Stability Criterion is an unfortunate one .
In 1921 , during his study of feedback oscillators , Barkhausen developed a ``formula for self - excitation ' '
The concept , as stated by Chestnut and Mayer , seems intellectually satisfying .
In fact , I 've often had students ( and professors ) ask , ``But if the gain around the loop is five , and the total phase shift around the loop is exactly zero , then does n't that imply that any signal around the loop will grow with time ? ''
This reasoning , although deeply flawed , seems to make sense .
There is no shortage of counterexamples , such as
Using Black 's Formula provides one refutation .
For a system with unity negative feedback and loop transfer function L(s ) , the closed - loop transfer function is

Remember how the Iranian elections results made the GOP assume voter fraud and start screaming about election integrity ?
The world is curiously silent now , is n't it ?
In the southern Afghan district of Shorabak , the tribesmen gathered shortly before last month ’s presidential election to discuss which candidate they would back .
After a debate they chose to endorse Abdullah Abdullah , President Hamid Karzai ’s leading opponent .
The tribal leaders prepared to deliver a landslide for Abdullah – but it never happened .
They claim Ahmed Wali Karzai , the president ’s brother and leader of the Kandahar provincial council , detained the local governor and closed all the district ’s 46 polling sites on election day .
The ballot boxes were taken back to the district headquarters where , tribal leaders allege , they were stuffed with ballots by local policemen .
A total of 23,900 ballots were finally sent off to Kabul , the capital – every one of them a vote for Karzai .
The alleged fraud , which Ahmed Wali Karzai denies , was the most blatant example among hundreds of incidents that have threatened to make a mockery of the election .
The sheer scale and audacity of the cheating , which includes supposedly “ state - sponsored ” ballot - stuffing , vote burning , intimidation and the closure of polling stations in antigovernment areas , has overwhelmed the country ’s fledgling Electoral Complaints Commission .
Its staff are battling with more than 2,600 reports of vote - rigging , including at least 650 deemed serious enough “ materially ” to influence the result .
“ This is a blatant violation of the procedure and I think it is stealing in daylight , ” Abdullah said yesterday .
His aides say privately that if Karzai wins the 50.1 % of votes needed for victory in the first round , they wo n’t accept the result .
Abdullah said he intended to use all legal means to challenge any Karzai victory ; his supporters talked menacingly of “ Iran - style protests with Kalashnikovs ” .
It ’s always interesting to see how Sony ’s PlayStation 3 is fairing within Nielsen reports in comparison to the Wii and Xbox 360 .
The firm recently sampled 17,000 TVs across the United States last December , an ideal time to conduct this type of study as a lot of teenagers are out of school for winter break .
In what may come as a surprise to some , PlayStation 3 lead the pack in what we think are the most significant categories : Active User Percentage and Daily Average Sessions .
We ’ve included the revealed rankings below .
Active User Percentage
Nintendo Wii – 6.8 %
Xbox 360 – 10.2 %
PlayStation 3 – 10.6 %
Average Usage Days
Nintendo Wii – 5
Xbox 360 – 7.1
PlayStation 3 – 6.8
Daily Average Sessions
Nintendo Wii – 1.78
Xbox 360 – 2.15
PlayStation 3 – 2.42
Despite the ridiculous lead that Nintendo has built in marketshare with its family - friendly console , it would appear the average consumer spends decidedly less time waggling their Wii motes per session than hammering away at a Sixaxis or 360 pad .
Nick Clegg kicks off the conference season pledging to replace Labour as " the dominant force of progressive politics " .
Just as a century ago Labour once vanquished a collapsed Liberal party , so now this is " the Liberal moment " again , and a moribund Labour will be beaten into third place .
Looking at the pitiful state of Labour and its leader , that should make sense .
But then why are n't the Liberal Democrats doing better ?
That 's the puzzle for those assembling in Bournemouth this weekend .
This should indeed be their moment .
A perfect storm of opportunities should see the Lib Dems ' star rising higher than it has for years .
But the way things are , according to leading psephologist Professor John Curtice , they may even struggle to keep the seats they hold .
They usually score well in local and European elections – but not in the last year , coming fourth in the Euros with just 14 % of the vote .
The Lib Dems seem to have lost their old knack for snatching byelection seats ; their share of the vote fell in both byelections this year .
More alarming , in the local elections in their south - west fastness they lost three counties where they have 12 seats to defend and they failed to win the new Cornish unitary authority .
After dipping in the opinion polls at the end of last year , they have risen steadily to 19 % now .
Vince Cable is the nation 's dancing star of the crash – but he still is n't bringing in enough new votes .
With Labour stumbling towards cataclysmic defeat , the Lib Dems should be the natural refuge for fleeing centre - left voters .
Labour and its leader are more unpopular than they have ever been .
Nor is there much sign of Conservative popularity : they succeed only through popular determination to throw the Labour rascals out .
The public is boiling with anti-politics fury after the MPs ' expenses scandal , so the Lib Dems should have scored , since they were barely touched by house - flipping and tax - dodging .
In 2005 they had two bright beacon issues – their brave stand against the Iraq war , and the abolition of tuition fees .
But the war is all but over for the UK , and the party has abandoned its opposition to fees .
Professor Curtice points to the failure to capture 15 % of runaway voters who are bypassing the Lib Dems in favour of " others " .
He suggests the party needs to focus on its powerful clean - up - politics and beat its constitutional reform drum .
To recapture the green vote , they need to shout a louder green message .
These two great failures by the old parties are , after all , the reason we need Lib Dems .
Grown since the days when they all fitted in a taxi , they are now contaminated by Westminster .
Their remarkable local government success sees them controlling outright virtually every major city in the land – Liverpool , Newcastle , Sheffield , Portsmouth , Edinburgh and Cardiff among the rest – but that makes it harder to be convincing insurgents .
Nick Clegg has personal ratings Gordon Brown would die for : a BBC poll showed around 48 % saying he was " in touch with ordinary people " , " trustworthy " and " competent " .
The poll did n't ask about consistency , but luckily few specific Lib Dem policies lodge in the public memory .
Their recent tax policies have been a rollercoaster ride – reflecting a far greater uncertainty about who they are – since the departure of Charles Kennedy .
If tax - and - spend defines a party , those policies have never mattered more as emblems of identity .
The detail may escape most voters , but all parties need to declare their essential character loudly .
Under Kennedy , the Lib Dems proposed a 50 % top rate on earnings over £ 100,000 .
But Clegg waved a very different flag : when that 50 % rate was abandoned , he promised instead to cut the basic income tax rate by a walloping 4 % .
That flag declared that this was now a high - tax party , but aiming for middle - ground Tory votes .
But that policy was abandoned too this April , in favour of taking 4 million people earning under £ 10,000 out of tax altogether , raking it back from the rich by cutting relief on top -rate pensions and adding new green taxes .
In truth , Lib Dem tax policies are decently redistributive , yet seem deliberately to avoid flying any symbolic flag to show which way their ship is heading .
When Clegg tells the Guardian today that he will make " savage cuts " , this is not altogether new .
In his 2008 conference pitch , with a document called Make It Happen , Clegg promised not only tax cuts but a cut in spending , claiming Labour was wasting money on needless programmes .
It seems doubtful that a boast of " savage cuts " will go down too well in Newcastle , Liverpool or Sheffield , which are mightily dependent on public spending , though it may play better further south .
Yet again , caught in the old Lib Dem dilemma , Clegg fails to make up his mind about which vote he is really aiming for .
If he was serious , he could go for Labour 's jugular with an unequivocally radical message .
The empty political ground is not in the crowded centre , but out in the near - deserted radical wastelands .
But Clegg looks over his shoulder , anxiously protecting those essentially conservative seats that so many of his MPs hold .
On any conventional reckoning , the Lib Dems are challengers in just eight of Labour 's 50 most marginal seats .
Tories are their main contenders in most seats .
That electoral arithmetic would make it daring for Clegg to launch a single - minded assault on Labour 's exposed left flank .
But then what is the point of a third party if it lacks the daring of insurgency ?
Pickings could indeed be rich if they had to the nerve to risk their existing Tory strongholds and throw everything at Labour 's rotting boroughs .
But that is not Clegg 's game .
His pamphlet for mainly Cameroonian Demos and his article telling Times readers that he is attacking Labour are a strategy for reassuring Tory voters .
If he were wholeheartedly aiming to capture angry Labour voters with nowhere else to go , then his flags would be redder and there would be no boasting of savage cuts .
He would be storming Labour citadels and summoning angry Labour voters to his cause .
His flag would be an economic policy that did n't parrot the dangerous current group - think that declares debt must be paid down fast and furiously by whatever next government .
Instead he has joined the slash - and - burn brigade , just when he should be offering the alternative voice of calm reason .
It is not an idle boast for Clegg to claim he could lead his party to overtake Labour ; but to do it , he has to go for it – and go radical .
Did n’t you love it when Barack Obama accidentally sang the virtues of UPS and FedEx whilst decrying the mediocrity of the post office this week ?
You know , talked about how poorly a government bureaucracy does with a job that private industry does well ?
I love it as context for this .
Henry Payne wrote a lot of brilliance at Planet Gore today on how well that whole Cash for Clunkers thing is working .
I ’m quoting a hell of a lot of this with very little added content ; just consider it a testimony to the excellence of what he wrote .
Go with me on this .
Read :
The clunkers law signed by President Obama requires that dealers be reimbursed by the government within ten days for the $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 credits they ’ve paid to customers .
The DOT says it ’s working through computer problems .
“ Very few dealers are getting very little money , ” said Bob Israel , president of the Louisiana Automobile Dealers Association .
“ It ’s not working smoothly at all . ”
David Wilson , a Toyota dealer in Orange County , Calif. , has been paid for only three of 92 claims he submitted before Aug. 2 , leaving him in the lurch for $ 374,000 .
North Carolina ’s Brad Wood has 12 unpaid claims since Aug .
1 . He ’s received just $ 26,000 of the $ 319,000 in rebates he is owed .
“ I ’ve never experienced anxiety like this in business before , ” he says .
“ If I do n’t get paid , I will have been working almost free for several months . ”
National Auto Dealers Assoc. ( NADA ) spokesman Bailey Wood said dealers are “ angry and nervous .
They ’re getting fed up with the program . ”
And there are other problems .
First , NHTSA demanded that all clunkers engines be immediately destroyed by running sodium silicate through them to satisfy green zealots that the planet - offending devils have been permanently removed from the road .
But dealers got that rule changed after the first week as it became apparent that the clunkers claims would n’t be processed for weeks and some might be rejected — meaning they ’d have to give their customers their cars back .
In running order .
Fearful of these and other legal ramifications , says Michigan dealer Fox , the NADA drew up a form for all customers to sign informing them that dealers are not liable if the feds ( whenever they get around to it ) reject their clunker .
But NHTSA — under pressure from consumer activists this time — is now instructing customers not to sign the form , leaving dealers exposed financially and causing more irritation with the program .
Many deals are also are getting rejections for procedural minutiae that they ca n’t straighten out because the 200 employees DOT has allocated program are n’t enough .
Employees are inaccessible by phone or e-mail , NADA ’s Wood says .
The problem ?
Unlike the IRS , for example , which does n’t audit every tax form , all clunkers applications must be reviewed .
That ’s 315,000 forms so far ( for a staff of 200 ) .
Washington is scrambling to boost the number of employees to 1,000 , but that will cost more money in a program already tight for cash .
Everybody ready for government health insurance and government - run national health connectors now ?
In their most recent experiments with Geobacter , the sediment - loving microbe whose hairlike filaments help it to produce electric current from mud and wastewater , Derek Lovley and colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Amherst supervised the evolution of a new strain that dramatically increases power output per cell and overall bulk power .
It also works with a thinner biofilm than earlier strains , cutting the time to reach electricity - producing concentrations on the electrode .
“ This new study shows that output can be boosted and it gives us good insights into what it will take to genetically select a higher - power organism . ”
The work , supported by the Office of Naval Research and the U.S. Department of Energy , is described in the August issue of the journal , Biosensors and Bioelectronics , now available online .
Findings open the door to improved microbial fuel cell architecture and should lead to “ new applications that extend well beyond extracting electricity from mud , ” Lovley says .
In the new experiments , the UMass Amherst researchers adapted the microbe ’s environment , which pushed it to adapt more efficient electric current transfer methods .
“ In very short order we increased the power output by eight - fold , as a conservative estimate , ” says Lovley .
“ With this , we ’ve broken through the plateau in power production that ’s been holding us back in recent years . ”
Now , planning can move forward to design microbial fuel cells that convert waste water and renewable biomass to electricity , treat a single home ’s waste while producing localized power ( especially attractive in developing countries ) , power mobile electronics , vehicles and implanted medical devices , and drive bioremediation of contaminated environments .
Geobacter ’s hairlike pili are extremely fine , only 3 to 5 nanometers in diameter or about 20,000 times finer than a human hair , and more than a thousand times longer than they are wide .
Nevertheless , they are strong .
Nicknamed nanowires for their role in moving electrons , pili are the secret to this particular microbe ’s ability to produce electric current from organic waste and sediment .
Geobacter ’s pili seem critical for forming the biofilm which aids transfer of the electron products to iron in soil and sediment .
In nature , bacteria colonies form gluey biofilms to anchor to a surface such as a tooth or an underwater rock , providing a living environment near a food source .
The Geobacter biofilm ’s “ fortuitous ” electron - transferring skill , the product of natural selection , suggested a pathway to Lovley―a way he might use selective pressure to increase its capacity to produce power .
He and colleagues grew Geobacter as usual on a graphite electrode , providing acetate as food and allowing a colony to form the biologically active slime , or biofilm where electron transfer takes place across the nanowires .
But for this new experiment they added a tiny , 400 - millivolt “ pushback ” current in the electrode that forced Geobacter to press harder to get rid of its electrons .
The result of providing a more challenging environment , within five short months , Lovley notes , was evolution of a beefed - up microorganism that can press at least eight times more electric current across the electrode than the original strain .
“ I ’m really happy with this outcome , ” the microbiologist notes .
“ It ’s exceptionally fast feedback to us and a very satisfying result . ”
He adds , “ I ’m still a little amazed that they make electricity , but I ’m happy to be exploring how to harness that ability .
I ’m sure there ’ll be applications developed in the future that we ca n’t even envision right now . ”
Lovley ’s first experiments with the anaerobic microbe , Geobacter , which he and colleagues discovered in sediment under the Potomac River in 1987 , explored its use in decontaminating soil due to its ability to respire iron and other metals the way we breathe oxygen .
Geobacter showed promise for a variety of bioremediation tasks , but the microbiologists further discovered in 2002 that it could produce electricity from the organic matter found in soils , sediments and wastewater .
This ability appeared to be a feature of the electrically conductive pili , discovered in 2005 .
Together , these discoveries have led to intense research on how to harness the microbes for producing electricity in microbial fuel cells .
Microbial fuel cells , which convert fuel to electricity without combustion , consist of an electrode known as an anode that accepts electrons from the microorganisms , and another electrode known as a cathode , which transfers electrons onto oxygen .
Electrons flow between the anode and the cathode to provide the current that can be harvested to power electronic devices .

In recent years , the ethics and overall legality of the Professional Ghost Story ( or Neverwas ) has come into question .
The sale of regrets , as we know , is a trade as old as history itself ; the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II financed the construction of the famous Hanging Gardens primarily with the sale of his wife ’s regrets to the Assyrians .
The most common igneous rock exported by the Mayans was not , in fact , obsidian , but regret .
Namely , the regret of catching smallpox .
Few modern analysts dispute the historical and modern relevance of regret sales ; rather , it is the lifestyle and practices of the actual regret salesman that raises issues .
Regrets , naturally , come in various flavors and qualities , the best by far always coming from one with the highest concentration of despair : a Neverwas .
On occasion a Neverwas will occur naturally in a hobo boxcar or trust fund , but more often than not it requires years of dedicated training to ensure that no meaningful life decisions are ever made ( the advent of the internet has allowed for marvelous advancements in this field ) .
A professional Neverwas , though rare , can generate a significant fortune and not spend it , making it a popular career among those who wish to not work and then not reap the benefits .

We already know that federal insurance programs work -- Medicare and Tricare .
Why are they now looking to pilot programs instead ?
It 's just another delaying tactic to prevent the national public option from ever getting started .
It 's also interesting that Rep.
Clyburn is now pushing this as a compromise since he 's a part of the House leadership .
On July 13th , he said that a public option would pass the House and get through the Senate via reconciliation .
But just a few weeks after that , he said on Bloomberg television that " I do not believe that we have to get to a public option on day one if it takes three , four , five years to get to the public option , the robust public option , I think that 's what we ought to do . "
Other kossacks also called out " pilot programs " for what they are --- another delaying tactic on a national public option :
" we have a pilot program .
it 's called freaking Medicare .
our reps think we are idiots . " by whataretheysmoking " Robust , national public option is already a compromise position .
Without it , there is no reform .
My brother has no health insurance .
He will not buy into private care under exchanges because they will be ridiculously expensive without competition from a robust , national public plan .
Pilots wo n't work .
They wo n't have the heft or scope needed to compete .
The data does not lie .
National public option along the lines of HB 3200 is the final compromise allowable .
Anything less is a loss . " by YallaDog " Public Option HAS to be National to Succeed .
Every minor variation of it : co-ops , regional / state pilot programs , etc will not have the power to compete with WellPoint et al .
Right now , the USA has a serious problem trying to regulate Wall Street because of the sheer power of the players .
Imagine a smal pilot public option program trying to fight the interests that are giant insurance companies .
It is not going to succeed .
It will only be a delay .
We need a national universal public option , and we need it now . " by chechecule
So PLEASE CALL Rep .
Clyburn 's office at ( 202 ) 225-3315 with the talking points below :
Hi , my name is [ insert name ] .
I 'd like to thank Rep. Clyburn for supporting the public option , but I do n't support any triggers , delays like regional pilot programs that he supports on the public option !
Regional pilot programs will not work , and they 're another delaying tactic .
We already have pilot programs in existence -- they 're called Medicare and Tricare .
We need a national public option on day one , and we NEED it now !
And if you live in Rep.
Clyburn 's district , PLEASE WRITE LETTERS TO THE EDITOR about why you want a trigger - free public option , and why you oppose co-ops , triggers , and regional pilot programs as delaying tactics on the public option !
And PLEASE CALL Rep .
Slaughter 's office at ( 202 ) 225-3615 with the talking points below :
Hi , my name is [ insert name ] .
I 'd like to thank Rep .
Slaughter for supporting the public option , but I do n't support any triggers , delays like regional pilot programs that he supports on the public option !

Please continue to call the Congressional Progressive Caucus to let them know that you do n't want any triggers , co-ops , or pilot programs as delaying tactics for a national public option !
Thank them for supporting the public option , and urge them to stand firm on the line in the sand for the public option as an essential part of real health care reform !
When you call , please REPORT BACK and remember to follow these steps below as outlined by nyceve :
It 's not enough to be told the member supports a public option .
Anyone who calls needs to ask the follow up : it 's great they support it , but I need them to commit to ONLY vote for a bill with a public option .
No coops , no triggers .
Nothing less .
Will they do that ?
This is what the offices need to hear - not just support .
Hold the line .
Please then report back on the form , what you 've unearthed .
I 'm still working on the new media project for a trigger - free public option , and will be finishing the web video this weekend .
I do have a slideshow up that I 'd like to share with you guys !
If you want to send in more pictures before the close of this weekend , please do so now !
1 . Take a picture of yourself with a sign explaining why you want a trigger - free public option .

Windows / Mac : Google 's free desktop photo organizer is stepping up to iPhoto 's killer feature by adding face recognition and syncing it with Picasa Web Albums , making it easy to send Uncle Bob every single photo you 've got of Aunt Marla .

The new Picasa 3.5 contains a facial recognition feature similar to the one already present on Picasa Web Albums , but letting it run over your likely vast collection of assorted photos stashed on your hard drive is a lot more convenient .
Picasa creates a new sidebar menu list of " People , " and asks you to name the folks it finds in its main " Scanning " menu .
If you 're signed into Web Albums with a Google account stuffed with contacts , that 's pretty easy , actually — just start typing a name , then select the contact that pops up as you type .

You 'll probably have to leave Picasa running a long time to get through everything — after 20 minutes , it 's about 9 percent through with 13.8 GB of photos on my laptop .
As you might guess , some of the facial matching is hit and miss , but you get to approve any of the picks Picasa is n't absolutely sure of , and if someone 's in your photo library who you do n't want to take the time to tag , you can send them to the " Ignored People " pile .
All this is in service of a better search function , so you can more easily find photos of yourself and your spouse , your spouse and her friend , or any combination of people , dates , or other search parameters .

With a combined capacity for 313,000 tonnes of oil , the Delta Ios and the NS Burgas supertankers were launched two months ago to criss - cross the globe in search of trade .
Instead , the vast vessels were to be found yesterday lying idle off the coast of Singapore after their owners were paid by two of the world 's richest and most secretive oil companies to turn them into floating petrochemical warehouses .
At first glance , the decision by Trafigura Group and Vitol Holding BV to charter the newly built ships at an estimated cost of £ 47,000 a day to do nothing for up to four months in South - east Asia while laden with cargos of diesel worth at least £ 77 m per vessel makes little economic sense .
When this is combined with the fact that the Delta Ios and the NS Burgas are just two ships in an enormous fleet of tankers which are currently being paid about £ 80 m a month by independent oil traders like Trafigura and Vitol , as well as giants such as Shell , to stay anchored around the globe with anything between 50 and 150 million barrels of redundant crude on board , it seem that the ruthless barons of black gold must be losing money as fast as they can make it .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Far from it .
The phenomenon of " floating storage " , which has been brought about by a huge over - supply of global tanker capacity and unusual market conditions , is just one example of the multitude of ways in which a small group of private , mostly Swiss - based companies have become adept at turning vast profits from the closed and often murky world of independent oil trading .
A glut of oil caused by the recession means that crude available for immediate purchase is currently cheaper than that bought on longer - term or " future " contracts – a practice known as " contango " .
The result is that independent traders have been rushing to buy the cheaper " spot " oil and storing it wherever they can – namely in under - employed tanker fleets – in anticipation of a sharp rise in price as the global economy begins to recover .
The resulting profit can be anything between 15 and 20 per cent – tens of millions of dollars – even after the cost of hiring a tanker is deducted .
It is a situation which prompted one senior oil company executive to declare that the spring and summer of 2009 represented " blessed times for trading " .
Another oil trader told The Independent : " Contango has been a real boon .
The independents have become very adept at buying up tanker capacity as cheaply as possible , sitting on the stock and selling it on via arbitrage .
They 've been as slick as you like . "
The deals are part of a world in which discretion and an ability to keep out of the public eye have long been treasured .
While the oil majors such as ExxonMobil , Shell and BP operate as global corporations , the independents or " jobbers " have thrived in the grey zone of fast trading - room deals and personal contacts that allow access to lucrative oil reserves .
But increasingly the activities of the " big four " independent traders – Trafigura , Vitol , Gunvor ( which has consistently denied reports that it is linked to the Russian Prime Minister , Vladimir Putin ) and the hugely successful Glencore – are coming under scrutiny .
Questions are being asked about their role in uniting the oil wealth of some of the world 's more unsavoury regimes with the open market .
Trafigura , which until August 2006 was barely known outside the oil trade – despite growing to become one of the world 's biggest companies with a turnover of $ 73 bn ( £ 46 bn ) since it was founded 16 years ago – last week found itself making headlines around the world when it agreed to pay about £ 30 m to thousands of residents of the Ivory Coast port of Abidjan who fell ill after toxic oil waste from a ship chartered by the company was dumped by a sub- contractor near the west African city .
The settlement of the claim brought on behalf of 31,000 Ivorians at the High Court in London after tonnes of foul - smelling sludge were fly - tipped in August 2006 was said by Trafigura to vindicate its position that there was no link between the waste and people who died or suffered serious illnesses .
But the Abidjan pollution disaster shone a light into the nature of the way these multibillion - pound " jobbers " of the oil trade make their money .
In the case of Trafigura , the events of August 2006 were just part of a deal conducted across three continents in which a cheap , low - quality form of oil known as coker gasoline bought from a Mexican refinery was further refined in Europe , and the subsequent fuel was sold at a profit of about $ 7 m per cargo .

Oil industry insiders have told The Independent that coker gasoline is just one of a myriad of methods used by independent traders to turn a profit , ranging from " paper " deals struck in the City of London 's trading floors , to floating storage , to what is known as " physical trading " – transporting hundreds of consignments of different grades of oil on chartered tankers looking for the best price from dozens of offices across the globe .
Executives , who are frequently equity partners in the companies , speak of constant shuttling around the world to close deals and negotiate prices .
By any standards , it is a huge and profitable industry .
From a situation 20 years ago where the " majors " dominated the international trade , independents now account for about 15 per cent of world 's $ 2 trillion oil industry .
Glencore , founded in 1974 by the controversial trader Marc Rich – who was indicted for tax evasion and later pardoned by President Bill Clinton – is estimated to supply 3 per cent of the world 's daily oil consumption .
The company is no longer involved with Mr Rich .
Between them , the " big four " had turnovers last year of about $ 415 bn – equivalent to the GDP of Austria .
Because the companies are privately owned , comprehensive profit figures are hard to come by , but Glencore announced a profit of $ 4.75 bn for 2008 .
Trafigura made $ 440 m last year .
In an industry which deals with a commodity for which many countries have gone to war , insiders say it is inevitable that traders will find themselves dealing with authoritarian oil - rich regimes and dabbling in controversial schemes .
On at least one occasion , three of the big four – Glencore , Trafigura and Vitol – have been found to have crossed the line between incentives and kickbacks through their involvement in the United Nations ' oil - for - food scheme to help Saddam Hussein 's Iraq buy humanitarian supplies .
In the UN's Volcker report , all three companies were cited for paying surcharges demanded by Saddam 's regime to win oil supply contracts .
In 2007 , Vitol pleaded guilty in America to paying $ 13 m in surcharges , and the Swiss arm of Trafigura forfeited $ 20 m .
Both companies insisted that the deals had been handled in good faith via third parties .
Glencore , which was cited for paying $ 6.6 m in surcharges , denied any wrongdoing .
Glencore was also named in a 2005 High Court judgment as one of the companies which handled shipments of oil sold by the state - owned oil company of Congo - Brazzaville in central Africa .
It was subsequently shown that cash derived from the shipments was used by the son of the country 's President to pay credit card bills for shopping sprees in Paris .
There was no suggestion that Glencore acted improperly .
All of the " big four " point out that they operate in accordance with international law and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 's guidelines on business conduct .
But campaigners complain that a lack of transparency in the industry means that proper scrutiny of the oil - rich governments in Africa and the middlemen they deal with is impossible .
Gavin Hayman , director of campaigns for Global Witness , said : " These companies play a major role in selling Africa 's oil and their operations are notoriously opaque .
It would be legitimate to ask : ' How do they get these contracts , do they sell the oil for its proper price , and do they send the money back to the correct place ?'
" This lack of transparency creates a big risk that corrupt officials can siphon off some of the profits and deprive ordinary citizens of their rightful benefit from natural resource wealth . "
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Has Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley saved or scuttled President Barack Obama 's health - care reform ?
Grassley , the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee and a crucial swing vote , announced Thursday that he was killing the so - called " death panel " provision in the health - care reform bill .
See full story .
That section of the bill would have required that the government pay for patients -- if they wish -- to talk to their doctor about what kind of care they want at the end of their lives , including information about living wills .
Republican opponents of reform had latched onto the provision , arguing as Sarah Palin did , that the bill mandated euthanasia of the elderly , the sick and the lame .
Every independent fact - checker has concluded that the section would do no such thing , but would merely give patients the right and ability to control their own care .
It specifically prohibited spending any government money for euthanasia or physician - assisted suicide .
But that did n't stop the " death panel " controversy from overwhelming the reasonable debate about whether this bill is the best bill .
Grassley , normally a moderate voice who rarely kowtows to the far right of his party , endorsed the " death panel " view of the bill at a town hall meeting on Wednesday , saying " We should not have a government program that determines if you 're going to pull the plug on grandma . "
On Thursday , Grassley said he'd removed the provision completely from the bill .
Grassley has the power to do that because the White House and the Senate Democrats have said they want a " bipartisan " bill , and Grassley 's vote is absolutely required to get a " bipartisan " bill through the Finance Committee .
It could be that Grassley has done Obama and the country a big favor by removing the provision , thus allowing the debate to get back to what 's really important :
How to best make sure that all Americans have adequate and affordable health care .
Or it may be that Grassley has simply given up on the bill , knowing that his political future as a senator from Iowa depends more on blocking a primary challenge from the right than it does on crafting sensible legislation .
There 's a third , even sadder , possibility : Grassley 's feelings may be hurt by the fact that a Democratic Party with 60 senators just do n't need him as much as a Democratic Party with 50 senators does .

Since Chris ( er , I mean , us ) didnât get his ( our ) Char Siu Bao fix at dim sum last weekend , I decided to whip some up with the leftover shredded pork I had .
â Char Siu Baoâ means â BBQ Pork Bunâ , is usually steamed or baked , and generally served at dim sum .
These are the steamed versions .
Lemme warn you , itâll be a little time consuming .
But I did just spoil you with easy Chocolate Mousse in a blender that required no effort .
So now Iâll throw you back into reality and make something from scratch that requires a bit of effort .
The pulled pork Iâm using needs to be made beforehand .
I decided to use pulled pork because , well , thatâs what I had .
Typically you can use pork diced into small pieces , and mixed with a Chinese BBQ ( Char Siu ) sauce .
Iâll post a recipe for the shredded pork though , since thatâs what I made .
And it is very similar to my Pulled Pork recipe .
The pulled pork in itself is very time consuming so Iâll post 2 variations .
Of course , neither variation has anything to do with roasting , since I have yet to actually roast Char Siu the way itâs supposed to be made .
Leave it to me to find multiple , alternate routes for no particular reason … .

Bah .
I will be attempting these again , one dayâ ¦overall they tasted pretty good .

Cowboy Stadium Washrooms Christened With Mid-Game Sex [ Video ]
Total Pro Sports –
They say that a new stadium has not officially become a new stadium until if has been properly christened by some hardcore fans of the home team .
With that being said , ladies and gentlemen , may in introduce to you the now complete Cowboys Stadium !
There may be no better way to show you love for the home team than by bailing from your seats once the victory has been sealed in order to rush off to the bathroom with your mate for a celebratory quickie .
If there was any question as to where the loyalties of these two lovebirds lie , it was answered with their matching # 88 Irvin jerseys .
You just know that Michael would be so proud .
As the story goes , the romp took place in one of the rather spacious Hall of Fame box level bathroom stalls during the fourth quarter of the Monday night game between the Cowboys and the Carolina Panthers .
Fans in the area noticed some unusual noises coming from the stall , and much to there surprise , the two individuals were laid out on the floor banging .
Thank god for our present day technology as several onlookers snapped pics and videos with their phones .
When the two were finally finished , they exited the stall to a standing ovation from those in attendance to see their show .
When Jerry Jones decided to create this monster of a stadium , it likely was n’t done so with the intentions of accommodating the sexual fantasies of its visitors .
Sorry Jerry , if fans are going to be getting fucked at Cowboy Stadium , I guess they will do whatever it takes to make sure they are the ones fucking each other , rather than being fucked by you .

" Nothing good can come from the Federal Reserve , " writes Texas Congressman Ron Paul in his latest book hitting shelves this week , titled " End the Fed . "
" It is the biggest taxer of them all .
Diluting the value of the dollar by increasing its supply is a vicious , sinister tax on the poor and middle class . "
Paul makes the case that the Fed is the main culprit responsible for the current economic mess the country faces through the destructive policies of cheap credit and excessive money printing .
" Prosperity can never be achieved by cheap credit , " says Paul .
" If that were so , no one would have to work for a living .
Inflated prices only deceive one into believing that real wealth has been created . "
The Federal Reserve , created in 1913 , has been acting as the main central bank of the United States for nearly one hundred years .
Many Americans are either not sure or not interested in what role the Fed plays in managing the economy .
" The economic crisis has changed everything , " writes Congressman Paul .
Paul is currently pushing for passage of a bill , H.R. 1207 , that would allow for an unprecedented audit of the Federal Reserve .
The bill has 289 co-sponsors , and is gaining solid momentum in the House of Representatives .

This is baby Pablo .
He was the runt of a litter of Himalayan kittens .
We decided to keep Pablo with us because , well , as you can see , he looked a bit odd to say the least .
Based solely on his looks , we all assumed that this kitten was a boy and named him Pablo .
It turns out that he was in fact a she and was remamed Hershey and grew into the most beautiful cat .
The ultimate “ ugly duckling ” cat story .
Ben Thomas is on a mission to shrink cities !
The technique Ben uses to get the added Depth of Field in his pictures is tilt - shift photography , that makes aerial photographs of real scenes look like miniature models .
This technique is charming , as it applies to creating a ‘ model - sized ’ scenery that is catching on all over the globe ( mostly via flickr , the online photo sharing community ) .
The general idea behind Tilt / Shift photography is that special lenses can be bent from side to side ( tilt ) and also from from their normal parallel , in - line , plane ( shift ) .
The tilt seems to create photos with very specific , and changeable , focal point within the photo while the shift action can be used to correct geometric distortion ( converging lines ) .
However , both types of photography yield amazing , and unrealistic , results .

I consider Spaghetti alla Carbonara one of my culinary secret weapons .
No matter how sad the state of my refrigerator , chances are that I have all of the ingredients on hand to produce a steaming and satisfying plate of carbonara .
I 've learned over the years that as long as I have a few eggs , a chunk of Parmigiano - Reggiano , and some sort of cured pork product , I will never go hungry nor will I be disappointed .
There might be a few other incarnations of pasta that are equally as quick , but none deliver the richness of this simple mix of bacon , eggs , and pasta .
If you have never made this dish before , Ari Weinzweig 's recipe from Zingerman 's Guide to Better Bacon is a great place to start .
Boil the pasta , crisp up some pork ( bacon , pancetta , guanciale , even diced salt pork will do ) , drain the pasta , add it to the rendered pork fat , mix in the eggs and grated cheese , toss with a generous amount of black pepper , and you are finished .
Once you learn the basic formula you can add your own touches .
Fresh herbs are always a nice addition — I am particularly fond of parsley and chives .
You can deglaze the pan with white wine for a little added acidity or add a touch of cream if you like your pasta a bit saucier .
Win ' Zingerman 's Guide to Better Bacon '
As always with our Cook the Book feature , we have five ( 5 ) copies of Zingerman 's Guide to Better Bacon to give away this week .
UK 's top doctors write letter to U.S. politicians to battle ' lies ' about the NHS
Letter : Democratic senator John Kerry has called for evidence from the medical profession that Republican fears about the NHS were unfounded
More than 100 top doctors have signed an open letter to U.S. senators to counter ' lies ' about the National Health Service .
The NHS has been the subject of vicious attacks by senior Republicans angry at President Obama 's plans to reform healthcare in the country .
The furore has spilled over into the UK , where David Cameron has been embarrassed by Tory MEP Daniel Hannan appearing on American TV to describe the NHS as a ' 60 - year - old mistake ' .
Now , top British doctors have been moved to write an open letter to Democratic senator and former presidential candidate John Kerry , who has called for evidence from the medical profession that Republican fears were unfounded .
The doctors , including former president of the Royal College of Physicians Sir George Alberti and Professor Alan Maryon - Davis , president of the UK Faculty of Public Health , and patient groups , used their letter to point out that life expectancy is longer in the UK than the U.S. - showing , they claimed , it is a better system .
While everyone in the UK gets access to healthcare , free at the point of need , in the U.S. it is only available to those who have private insurance .
Some 45 million people have no health insurance whatsoever , and 25 million are not insured for all health conditions .
In their letter , they say it is important that they ' expose those lies which are about our National Health Service , a service which our experience shows to work successfully for the benefit of all in this country ' .
Opponents of President Obama 's healthcare reform plans say he wants to bring in ' socialised medicine ' as seen in the UK .
They have claimed that Edward Kennedy , who died last month of a brain tumour , would have died much earlier had he had to rely on the NHS - as treatment would have been withdrawn due to his age .
Another opponent claimed renowned scientist Stephen Hawking , who has motor neurone disease , would already be dead as the NHS would have decided not to treat him .
Example : U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy was used as an example
But in the letter the doctors say : ' There is no cut - off age for healthcare in the NHS .
Senator Kennedy , like anyone else of that age , or older , and with health problems such as his , would have been treated by the NHS with the same high levels of care as someone younger .
' Care for the elderly includes free flu vaccinations , free medication , free operations as needed , nursing care visits , and help and adaptions for the home .
Many hospitals now offer " hospital to home " programs for palliative and end of life care to enable very ill people to remain at home . '
And it added : ' Professor Stephen Hawking of Cambridge University , recently awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama , is disabled and has always been under the care of the NHS .
' Professor Hawking is an outspoken admirer of NHS care .
Like thousands of others who are disabled , he is entitled to free medical care and medicine , and he can get adaptions , equipment and home care to allow him to live at home . '
The letter says there is no truth in U.S. claims that NHS has ' death panels ' , which decide who should be saved and who should die , on the basis of cost .
They also dismissed claims that on the NHS , mothers are told to abort children if they have abnormalities .
And they say the NHS 's universal coverage was better than the U.S. system where people only get help if they have private insurance .
' In the U.S. , people with pre-existing health problems are rarely covered by private insurance companies for those problems , ' it said .
' Many do not change jobs for fear of losing cover for such conditions from their new insurers .
' The NHS is literally a life saver for those with pre-existing health problems - they are not denied care .
It is vitally important that the NHS , and any government financed health plan anywhere , undertakes the care of such people . '
The letter concludes : ' The NHS is funded by taxes and provides universal coverage while costing 8 per cent of UK GDP .
The U.S. system currently costs 16 per cent of GDP but leaves 45 million without insurance and a further 25 million under-insured .
' The NHS is available free of charge to all regardless of ability to pay , and does not discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions .
Importantly it gives freedom from fear of the financial consequences of illness .
' Survey after survey shows that British patients express a high degree of satisfaction with the care they personally receive from the NHS .
On average , British users of the NHS live longer and have a lower infant mortality rate than the U.S. '
The letter , which has been sent to U.S. senators and representatives and has also been published on the British Medical Journal website , was written by Dr Jacky Davis , a London radiologist .
' There 's so much ignorance and malice around this issue in the US , ' she said .
' The debate is skewed by vested interests - the healthcare companies who make millions of dollars of profits every year - with their campaign of misinformation .
' It is upsetting for those of us who have worked in the NHS for years that these lies are being spread . '

Go ahead , Miss Kathy .
Take your pick .
One of my fondest memories from childhood involved Sunday morning visits to a bread bakery .
Not really a bakery , but a factory , where bread was baked and packaged up for delivery to grocery stores and other outlets .
My Dad owned a tire service business and one of his customers was Leone ’s Bakery in Easton , Pennsylvania .
His company serviced their fleet of delivery trucks and my Dad was good friends with the owner .
One of the perks of that friendship was being invited to come in on Sunday and buy fresh bread that came right out of the ovens .
A six - year - old Kathy always got to join him .
The things I remember most after I stepped into the factory were the heat , the noise and the aroma of delicious fresh bread that wrapped its arms around you and would n’t let go .
It was intoxicating .
It could have been freezing cold outside , but the moment you walked into the factory , you were in a flour - dusted Sahara .
The bakers wore thin white uniforms , always short - sleeved , no matter what the temperature outside .
I pitied them in summer months .
And the noise !
The machinery that processed the dough and then sent it through an open - ended oven was massive and LOUD .
Clang , click , SHHHH .
Clang , click , SHHHH .
At the start of the assembly line , little chunks of dough were cut and dropped onto the belt where metal ice cream scoop - like arms would come down upon them , grab them and give a vigorous shake , until they formed little balls of goodness .
In perfect formation , the bread balls would move down the conveyer and into the oven , where they would bake up and fall out on the other side as crispy , delicious Kaiser rolls .
My Dad ’s friend would hand me a bag and tell me to go pick out a dozen of the best rolls in the bin .
I know it sounds silly , but getting to handpick seconds - old , piping hot rolls out of that bin made me feel special .
It was something my friends did n’t get to do because their Dads did n’t have an “ in ” with a bread guy .
Score !
You can probably gather by now that I was happy with the simple things in life , still am .
Two more things were about to happen that were such big deals to me in my young life .
After my Dad and I said our good - byes , we got in the car and my Dad would let me turn the ignition to start it .
Me !
Making this big machine start up all by myself !
CH-CH-CH-CH-CH-VROOOOOM !
Good job , Kathy .
Good job .
When we got home with our bread loot , some Kaisers and some French bread loaves , my next little excitement was to deliver one of the loaves to our neighbor Mrs. Meyers .
A sweet old lady , she would greet me at the door with a smile .
Morning , Mrs. Meyers !
I have your bread !
She ’d take the crispy loaf from my tiny hands and deposit back two shiny quarters for my trouble .
My Dad would never let Mrs. Meyers pay for the bread , but he did let her pay me for delivering it .
Thank you , Kathy .
You have a good day now , OK ?
I will , Mrs. Meyers !
And off I ran to my house to drop the quarters in my piggy bank and then rip into our own loot .
Nothing better than still - warm , crispy rolls broken apart and slathered with butter or stuffed with cheeses or meats .
Another Bread Sunday under my belt .
I do n’t remember when we stopped going together , but those trips with my Dad were some of the best in my kid memory .
When I first learned PHP 5 ’s object oriented syntax and rules , I did n’t see much of a point to the interface options .
I felt that I could do more by defining abstract classes and at least filling in some of the methods with some details .
Lots of people in the PHP world still are n’t 100 % sure the reasons that interfaces exist , or the best way to use them .
However , interfaces are very cool , and anyone who does OOP in PHP should know about them .
To start , what is an interface ?
An interface is a collection of completely abstract methods .
Interfaces do not contain any of the innerworkings of the application ; instead , they serve the sole purpose in setting a structure for the objects that implement them .
All of their methods must be public .
Here is a sample interface :
<? php interface DatabaseI { public function __construct ( ) ; public function connect ( ) ; public function query ( ) ; } [ / sourcecode ]
That does n't look very interesting at all , and it's not , until we start getting into < a href = " http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.typehinting.php "> type hinting </a> and using < a href= " http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.type.php ">instanceof</a> in PHP 5 . This is where the power of interfaces comes into play .
As a developer , I 've often wished there was a way to know that an object - any object - had implemented certain methods .
With type hinting and the instanceof operator , it is now possible to determine whether or not an object has those methods , and interfaces make this even easier .
Take for example : class withoutTypeHinting { public function __construct ( $databaseO ) { if ( method_exists ( ' connect ' ) { $ databaseO->connect ( ) ; } } } //
Now let 's use typehinting from our previous example class withTypeHinting { public function __construct ( DatabaseI $ databaseO ) { $ databaseO->connect ( ) ; } }
What ’s the difference there ?
In the first example , we ’re hoping that the method exists so that we can call it .
We ’ll have to throw an exception or do something if the connection does n’t actually exist .
But in the second example , we ’re demanding an object that has implemented the methods in DatabaseI .
We know that these methods must have been implemented , because we ’re getting an instantiated object .
So the method must exist .
Interfaces make it much easier to predict what methods will be available , and also to ensure that subclasses still conform to some semblance of the structure you ’ve defined .
Interfaces are not without their drawbacks .
One huge drawback of interfaces is that you must implement them precisely as they are defined ; that is , because our __construct ( ) method contained no arguments , you must either make your __construct ( ) argument contain no arguments or set each argument to a value ( e.g. __construct ( $ a = true , $ b = false ) ; // etc ) .
When defining an abstract class , and abstract methods , the rules of inheritance apply , making it possible to redefine the argument list .
Also , because you have not defined anything but the method signature , you have no way of forcing it to return a particular type .
Finally , you may not build an interface containing protected methods ; you must use an abstract class for this .
Still , interfaces rock .
They allow you to enforce the type of object and the methods that must be defined , and with type hinting you can always feel confident that a method is implemented , regardless of how that interface is extended .

Tamil detainees in Sri Lanka : “ Almost living in hell ”
By our correspondents
25 September 2009
The Sri Lankan government has underscored its determination to keep 280,000 Tamil civilians in internment camps indefinitely , in blatant violation of their basic democratic rights .
UN Under - Secretary , Lynn Pascoe arrived in Sri Lanka last week for further talks on resettling detainees .
Sri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapakse told him his government had a target of resettling 70 percent of the people within 180 days .
But he added that this target would depend on the de-mining of the former war zone in the island ’s north .
As if to show that this time frame was not serious , Rajapakse said Croatia had been carrying out de-mining for 16 years and was still not finished .
His message was unmistakable : the government has no plans to resettle detained civilians for the foreseeable future .
Four months have now passed since the last Tamil civilians were detained after fleeing from the attacks of the Sri Lankan military in its offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) .
It has been obvious from the start that these so - called displaced persons ’ camps are nothing but giant prisons fenced with razor wire and guarded by armed soldiers .
Hundred of thousands of civilians have been herded into several dozen squalid camps around the northern town of Vavuniya , including 160,000 in four huge centres at Manik Farm , near Chettikulam .
All of the detainees — men , women and children — are treated as potential LTTE “ terrorists ” , underscoring the communal character of the government ’s anti-Tamil war .
While the UN has feigned concern for the detainees , it has funded the detention camps to the tune of $ US188 million over the past three months .
This funding has given de facto support for the clear violation of Sri Lankan and international law involved in the mass detention of Tamils .
The Rajapakse government has banned independent local and international media and aid agencies from the camps .
It is intent on both hiding the conditions in the camps and preventing survivors of the northern war zone from speaking out about the army ’s war crimes during the final months of the conflict .
We publish below a report filed by a WSWS team that visited some of the Vavuniya camps recently .
***
We arrived in Vavuniya , where many of the detention camps are located , two months after our last visit .
The government ’s propaganda that the situation in the camps has improved is false .
The military maintains checkpoints to rigorously screen visitors to the town and camps , and troops conduct heavy patrolling .
Everyone who comes to Vavuniya by train or bus has to register with the police , explain the reason for their visit and supply the address of their place of stay .
On leaving Vavuniya , the same process applies .
The day we visited , the whole town was heavily guarded by the army and the Special Task Force ( police commandos ) .
The bus stand was completely cleared .
We discovered later that there was much propaganda about “ releasing ” 10,000 refugees to their home areas .
We saw several dozen buses parked around the Manik Farm camps to take refugees .
However , later reports revealed that at least half of the refugees had been detained in other camps in their home districts .
M. Shivanandan , 49 , told Reuters on September 17 : “ I ’m disappointed to have left Vavuniya thinking that we could go home ” .
He was being detained at a school in eastern Trincomalee , where 320 civilians were held under army guard .
Human Rights and Disaster Management Minister , Mahinda Samarasinghe admitted that people were being held in so - called transit camps .
Without confirming when they would be released , Samarasinghe told Reuters they would be sent home “ in a few days or weeks ” .
This charade took place in the lead up to the visit by UN Under - Secretary Lynn Pascoe to Sri Lanka .
Inside the camps , security has been tightened .
One of the four Manik Farm camps has been divided into 15 small zones , each holding about 2,750 people .
This division has been carried out , not to provide more facilities for inmates , but to monitor them more tightly , with increased military guarding .
Government officials had expressed concern that large camps were difficult to control .
Last time we visited we saw long queues of several hundred people every day waiting to see their relatives in the camps .
But because of harassment and intimidation by the security forces and the heavy expense of making the journey , only a few people are now arriving to see their relatives .
Earlier , relatives had to talk to prisoners by standing face - to - face , divided by a barbed - wire fence .
Now five feet wide barbed - wire fences have been erected to further separate visitors and inmates .
People separated by five feet have to shout to speak to each other , and no one can hear clearly .
And because there are fewer crowds , soldiers are watching visitors everywhere , preventing anyone having a private conversation .
The conditions inside the camp are terrible .
One recently released old man from the Manik camp told us : “ Life inside the camp is almost living in hell .
We faced a lot of problems after we left the LTTE - controlled areas .
We were without food for several days .
When asked for water , we were scolded in filthy language .
“ Finally , packed like animals , we were brought here .
Initially , food parcels were thrown from vehicles .
Whoever got them ate , and others had to starve .
Several elderly people with me died of starvation during the early days .
“ The government is talking about improvements but that is just propaganda .
When higher international officials come to the camps , the military arranges a good show for them .
Many young men and girls have been taken from the camp and nobody knows what has happened to them .
“ Sanitation is a big problem .
During the past four months I took a bath only four times .
All the toilets are almost full .
People are suffering with infectious diseases and some have died .
The government is trying to kill with disease the people who escaped their guns , and claim it is just a natural disaster .
Diarrhoea , viral fever and skin diseases are very common .
Children and babies do n’t get milk - based foods .
We always get the same routine meal — the very cheapest vegetables and rice . ”
Komarasankulam camp is set up at a government school near Vavuniya .
There are 2,400 people detained there , including 600 children .
Visitors meet detainees in a shed guarded by several soldiers .
When we approached one police officer at around 7 a.m. , he said visits were not possible because there was a “ water problem ” and asked us to come two hours later .
Over 500 people were waiting in a long queue with plastic cans to collect water from the only tube well for the entire camp .
Refugees told us they started waiting as early as 2 a .m. to collect water .
Only 45 temporarily toilets covered with polythene have been provided for the 2,400 detainees .
Most of them are filled and cannot be used .
The stench is all around .
There is only one doctor for the entire camp .
He comes for just two hours a day .
One person told us that several people had died from fever and diarrhoea .
Only very seriously - ill patients are taken to Vavuniya hospital .
Because of the government ’s propaganda about releasing people to relatives , many families have submitted applications .
But only elderly people over 60 have been released .
It is a lengthy procedure , with applications having to pass through several administrative divisions .
However , the final decisions are taken by the area military commander .
Officers in the camps have informed people that even if they were to be released , no one would be allowed to resettle in Kilinochchi and Mullaithivu in the Vanni region , areas that were captured by the military in the final stages of the war .
The military has recently cleared a jungle area to set up a camp at Murasomottai in the eastern Trincomalee district , where about 2,300 refugees are detained .
This is one of the so - called transit camps .
One inmate said : “ We are liberated , the government boasts !
But we are detained here in a jungle .
During rainy days we have to stand , as there is water on the floor .
Visitors are only allowed to talk for 15 minutes , then they are chased away .
Snake bites are common in this camp .
My 27 - year - old daughter lost both her legs in Kilinochchi .
I have lost my wife .
This is an intolerable situation . ”
Batman : Arkham Asylum is inspired by , rather than a direct adaptation , of the movie .
Video games developer Eidos have come up with a novel way of catching users playing pirated copies of their game .
Players using illegal copies of Batman : Arkham Asylum have found that essential control functions in the game have been disabled , rendering it unplayable .
One user complained on the Eidos forum that there was a bug in the code , only to be told by the administrator that they had " a bug in your moral code " .
The PC version of the stealth action adventure goes on sale later this week .
Players attempting to use the glide function within the game will find it disabled in pirated versions , resulting in the Batman character coming to an untimely end .
The protection system came to light when a user complained on the Eidos support forum saying : " When I ... jump from one platform to another , Batman tries to open his wings again and again instead of gliding . "
An Eidos community manager replied , saying the user had encountered " a hook " in the copy protection system , designed to " catch out people who try and download cracked versions of the game for free " .
" It 's not a bug in the game 's code , it 's a bug in your moral code , " he added .
While Eidos did not want to spell out the mechanics of the copyright protection system , they did say that it was in place to deter hackers , although the fact the game is not yet on sale made this particular case of piracy somewhat obvious .

For those of you with cable TV service , for some time now you 've been witnessing the slow transition of cable TV from a pure analog service to a pure digital service .
With cable systems finally at their limits for bandwidth , within the last year the cable companies have finally begun what has been dubbed the " analog reclamation " - removing analog channels from their service and replacing them with digital versions that require 1/6th ( or less ) the bandwidth .
Because the reclamation involves removing analog versions of most for - cost channels ( what 's commonly called the Expanded Basic tier ) , the reclamation has been tied with the deployment of Digital Transport Adapters - low - cost cable boxes that are little more than a basic QAM tuner attached to an RF modulator .
This has allowed cable companies to reclaim this space without deploying otherwise very expensive Set Top Boxes to every TV at an affected household .
A side effect of this has been that computer TV tuner users , such as HTPC owners who in the analog age were accustomed to getting access to the EB tier on their computers with a simple analog TV tuner , were able to access those same channels in their digital form using ClearQAM - capable tuners .
This is because the FCC mandated that the security mechanism be separate from the STBs , which gave rise to the continually problematic CableCARD .
In the name of cost , DTAs do not have the ability to use CableCARDs , and as such do not meet the separable security requirements .
Ultimately this required cable operators to put the digital versions of their EB tiers in the clear if they wanted to use DTAs , and this is why ClearQAM tuners can exist in a useful manner .
That age , however short it was , looks to be coming to a close .
DTAs may be little more than a basic QAM tuner , but that " little more " is that they support a very basic form of encryption - a 56 bit DES - based cypher known as Privacy Mode - which would allow them to receive and decrypt lightly encrypted channels .
The FCC separable security mandate has previously prevented Privacy Mode from being used , but we have known for some time that cable companies and device manufacturers were looking to get a waiver for DTAs .
In effect they have been soliciting the FCC for permission to encrypt all EB tier channels with Privacy Mode , so that reception would be limited to DTAs and CableCARD devices .
The FCC has granted their request .
The ramifications are two - fold .
For the cable companies , once they implement this Privacy Mode across the board they will no longer have to install and maintain expensive signal traps to keep customers on lower tiers such as Limited Basic from accessing additional channels .
For computer / HTPC users , this is an end to being able to directly receive EB tier channels with any kind of commonly available digital tuner .
Privacy Mode is not open for licensing , and CableLabs will not license CableCARD for any kind of open ( read : not locked down to hell and back ) tuner .
This means ClearQAM tuners made by ATI , Hauppauge , SiliconDust , and others would no longer be useful for receiving EB tier channels .
For pure digital reception on computers / HTPCs , what would be left would be two things .
One would be fully licensed systems that implement head - to - toe DRM , the only way that CableLabs will license CableCARD for computers .
This is not cheap , and brings with it all the disadvantages of not building your own system .
The other would be utilizing the Firewire output of some STBs , but such STBs can be hard to acquire and the FCC allows broadcasts to include a copy - never ( 5C ) flag that disables this output .
The last option would be to take advantage of the analog hole left by the component video output of STBs , using devices such as Hauppauge 's HD PVR that can redigitize the output of STBs for importing into a computer .
The drawback of this is a loss of quality due to an analog generation being included in the process , and whatever pitfalls that come from using the STB such a device would be attached to .
None of these options are as simple and cheap as things stand today with a ClearQAM tuner .
At this point there 's no reason to believe that cable companies wo n't deploy Privacy Mode across their networks , so it 's a matter of " when " , not " if " this will happen .
It goes without saying that if you 're currently enjoying the use of a ClearQAM tuner to receive EB tier channels , you 'll want to enjoy what time you have left , and look into other solutions for the long - haul .
At this pace , it looks like cable TV and computers will soon be divorcing .
On a final note , the loss of ClearQAM access is likely going to be followed by the loss of some fraction of the HTPC market , where users will not find as much value in a device that can no longer watch or record live TV from their cable company .
Because of this potential nosedive in the HTPC market , I would be very surprised if Microsoft stayed entirely mum on the issue .
They 've put a lot of effort into Windows Media Center as a TV viewing platform and HTPC suite over the years , and this drives a stake right through that given the low adoption of CableCARD systems .
Microsoft has been diversifying their TV operations over the years by getting satellite companies on - board and making some investments in IPTV / Internet TV , but cable TV is too big to ignore if Microsoft wants to keep pushing WMC .
What this may lead to is anyone 's guess , but unless they 're going to drop the emphasis on TV viewing with WMC something will need to happen to keep WMC relevant in the cable TV space .

One tonne of drug discovered in frozen carcasses on container ship as officials face gang wars over supply routes to US
The lengths to which drug smugglers will go to conceal their consignments was revealed when the Mexican navy said it had seized more than a tonne of cocaine stuffed inside frozen shark carcasses .
Masked naval officers cut open more than 20 carcasses filled with slabs of cocaine after checking a cargo ship in a container port in the state of Yucatan .
X - ray machines and sniffer drugs led them to the stash .
" We are talking about more than a tonne of cocaine that was inside the ship , " said navy commander Eduardo Villa yesterday .
" Those in charge of the shipment said it was a conserving agent but after checks we confirmed it was cocaine . "
Drug gangs tapping the lucrative US market have been forced to come up with more imaginative methods of getting drugs to North America such as in sealed beer cans , religious statues and furniture , in the face of a crackdown by the Mexican military .
President Felipe Calderon has tasked 45,000 troops and federal police with crushing the powerful smuggling cartels responsible for a surge in violence across the country that has spilled over into US states such as Arizona , creating concern in Washington .
At a remote mountaintop site in the northern state of Sinaloa yesterday , the Mexican navy showed reporters one of the largest methamphetamine labs ever found in the country with enough ephedrine to produce more than 40 tonnes of the drug , estimated to be worth $ 1.4bn ( £ 900,000 ) .
But despite the efforts of government forces the gangs remain strong .
Some 2,750 people have died in drug violence in Mexico this year , a rate similar to last year , when 6,300 were killed .
Led by Mexico 's most wanted man , Joaquin " Shorty " Guzman , smugglers from the Pacific state of Sinaloa are fighting a turf war with rivals over smuggling routes into the US .

Paper ballots do not preclude the possibility of fraudulent elections , but cases of ballot stuffing become a whole lot easier to spot , as we 've seen recently Afghanistan .
E-voting opens the door not only to vote flipping on a grand scale --- which is probably what we experienced in the 2004 Presidential election --- but the ability to carry out a theft that is almost undetectable .

Kind of embarrassing to see a self - proclaimed expert quoting his friends as experts all asserting that they are not aware of a system other than the one that they use to promote their own efforts --- in effect casting aspersions on all alternatives while criticizing supports of other types of systems from potentially benefiting from their use --- when there are better systems out there .
Also , implying that statistical auditing requires no technical knowledge is misleading at best .
Moreover , assuming that there will be 5 or more counters ignores the possibility of biased polling locations and intimidation ; such an approach seems unrealistic even in the US , where we have trouble getting poll - workers and completely impossible unworkable in places like the examples cited of Iran and Kenya .
A solution that would work in the US and help in other countries would allow public audit without requiring chain of custody and all parties observing every polling place --- and such solutions do exist .

As to your more serious , anonymous criticisms : assuming that there will be 5 or more counters ignores the possibility of biased polling locations and intimidation ; such an approach seems unrealistic even in the US , where we have trouble getting poll - workers
We have trouble because we do n't pay them properly ( which we'd be able to afford , if we stopped paying the corporations for machines that do n't work , and which count in secret ) , and because we ask them to be rocket scientists , forced to work impossibly long days during the week .
Counting crews would come in * after * regular work days , be paid appropriately , work only a few hours , and in full view of everyone , including video cameras .
Still worried about someone gaming that system ?
Good , you get to stop them by revealing the evidence to all ( something you 're not allowed to do now , because you 're not allowed to witness the counting ) .
and completely impossible unworkable in places like the examples cited of Iran and Kenya .

Why is it impossible ?
That said , I 'm calling for democracy in the U.S.
We can worry about Iran and Kenya later , by first setting the example here in the U.S.

Remember Holt re : proprietary software " That 's a conversation we we'd like to have with the corporations ... " ?
And Brad , no further cries of " where are the throngs of pro-HCPB supporters ? " from you ?
Perhaps you have a dream that you can rewrite Holt 's corporate crapload of federal mandates into something decent ... but as it starts off from HAVA , enshrines that debacle of a bill , and then promptly gets worse from there you 'd probably have better luck trying to polish a turd into a platinum ingot .
It sure as hell ai n't the bill to try and squeak HCPB pilot projects in on .
Of course HCPB pilot projects ... ones that are not designed to fail from the start ... are a very good idea .
But it 's foolishness to try to get them in as part of a bill that 's a corporate giveaway and power grab .
Because no matter what you are told and no matter what you think is happening the bill will always turn out just like the corporations intended .
And they have no interest in viable HCPB .

No comment there , as I do n't know whether he's in league with the corporations necessarily , misunderstanding and misdiagnosing the overall problem , or if he 's just trying to propose what he believes is a passable bill .
Whatever reason , the current version of his bill has some huge flaws in it , and that 's what I was trying to point out where the article refers to him .

Proper vote counting has one essential feature that too often goes unmentioned : Adversaries do the counting .
This essential check - and - balance is totally lacking in machine counts .
Some officials think ( or at least claim ) that the equivalent is accomplished by machine - counting the ballots a second time .
But the machine they have in mind for the second count is either the same machine used in the first count , or an exact clone .
This is like asking one person to count the ballots , and then asking the same person ( or his clone ) to count the ballots again .
If the results match , that offers little or no evidence that the first count was accurate .
Unless computers never make a mistake .

Roy Libscomb is exactly right .
How many advocates of hand - counting would agree to one of the candidates performing the hand count on their own , then announcing their result without explaining how they arrived at it ?
And then , to add insult to injury , having that candidate conduct the recount ?
The issue is not whether technology should be used in aid of vote counting .
The issue is secret counting by one party that is not obliged to explain itself .
Caution : Self - serving statement follows ...
If election integrity activists cannot convince registrars of the need for hand - counted paper ballots , a sensible step is scanning and counting paper ballots via at least two independent paths .
Ideally , this would take place at the polling place before the ballots leave the room .
For those who still believe HCPB is the solution , this would be a step in that direction .
For those who believe the problem is not technology , but the way technology has been used to allow election results to be calculated in secret , this is the solution .

Mr. Lehto's summary of the German Constitutional Court decision is incorrect .
I will take as an example , one statement : " A paper trail simply does not suffice to meet the above standards . "
Paragraph 121 of the decision explicitly and specificially names VVPATS , as well as scanners , as useable in elections for getting an initial count , so long as the results can be checked by hand .
Electronic voting machines are not " totally banned " in Germany .
They will not be used in the upcoming election because there is not a system available that provides a paper trail .
But the court made it clear that systems that provide a paper trail could be used in the future , so long as the results are hand - checkable .
Everybody has the right to their own opinion about what the court decision should have been .
They should not , however , be mispreresenting what the court actually did say .
To quote the court 's own press release :
it is " constitutionally unobjectionable that § 35 of the Federal Electoral Act permits the use of voting machines . "

I agree in spirit with Mitch and his self - confessed " self - serving " statement .
He 's one of the movers in Humboldt County 's trailblazing " Election Transparency Project . "
The project 's mission is to scan images of all ballots cast in California 's Humboldt County and to publish those images on the Web .
Far from some blue - sky daydream , this project is already operational .
It launched in June of 2008 , and has publishing ballot images ever since then .
This excellent project is a quantum leap forward in transparency .
We owe a debt of gratitude to Mitch , to his fellow volunteers , and to County Clerk Carolyn Crnich , who envisioned , created , and supervised this project .
So it 's with some regret that I report that this leap forward has some deficiencies .
( Mitch , please correct me if I 'm wrong on any of these . ) *
The imaging is done by computerized scanner , which entails the same lack of transparency and the same potential for unnoticed errors that all computers are heir to ( even those using open - source software ) .
*
The process lacks the checks and balances of adversarial processing .
For each set of ballots , the project employs only one scanner ( or a clone ) , managed by one organization .
*
The scanning is done elsewhere than in the polling place .
*
The general public cannot easily ascertain whether the published set of images is an exact match for the actual ballots .
These limitations can be overcome by imaging technology that --
* is not computerized ,
* can be implemented in the polling place ,
* can implemented in full view of the public ,
* can be verified as accurate beyond a reasonable doubt at any time afterwards ,
* can be copied and distributed without limit .
The technology that ideally fits these specifications is the movie - film camera , supplemented by having the films copied digitally and posted on the Web .
Authenticity of the published copies would be confirmed by allowing anyone to compare them to the original films .
That 's a only rough sketch of an ideal process .
Its trustworthiness would have to be guaranteed by adequate , extensive checks and balances .
( See below . )
Admittedly , movie - film cameras are in short supply today .
But fortunately videocams are trustworthy enough to serve as substitutes .
( That may no longer be true when videocams become more computerized -- especially if they become user - programmable . )
* *
It 's heartening to see videocams receiving more and more press as possible tools in the polling place .
Their role , as commonly envisioned , would be to document activities in the polling place .
While this is an excellent use , it falls short of the full potential of videocams .
It still leaves us with having to assume that a vote count is correct if the camera caught no anomalous behavior .
That 's less than full transparency .
Full transparency would allow us to see for ourselves that the vote count is correct .
Do videocams have the potential to bring about full transparency ?
They do , if they 're granted one additional role : Capturing and publishing the contents of the ballots , so that anyone and everyone can count the votes for themselves .
Transparency does n't get any better than that .
To be trustworthy , of course , this strategy must be buttressed with careful checks and balances .
Some of these are discussed at
http://e-grapevine.org/citizensaudit.htm
( That document includes a proposal for a touch - screen ballot marker to help compose , error - check , and print the voter 's ballot .
The proposal has no bearing on the use of videocams , and can be safely ignored by those so inclined . )

Thanks ,
Roy , for your gracious reply .
I agree that the Humboldt project has some deficiencies , but I also agree that it 's a great leap forward .
I think election integrity advocates need to be willing to push the ball a few yards at a time , rather than constantly looking for a touchdown .
( Forgive the metaphor ; is that football or basketball , anyway ? )
The cited deficiency with which I most agree is that we are not scanning at the precinct ; I would be thrilled to find a jurisdiction that wanted to do a test of at - the - precinct - at - the - conclusion - of - voting scanning .
But Roy and I just disagree on some of his other concerns .
First , I do n't think film as opposed to scanners would necessarily be an improvement .
We could discuss that at length , but this is probably not the best forum .
And , in any event , I 'm sure many imaging approaches other than scanners are possible ; I 'm working on one now .
As for adversarial counting , I think the critical aspect is redundant counting by different parties , using different equipment .
The Humboldt project implements a second count , done to confirm or challenge the accuracy of the primary , official count .
As for the ability of the public to easily confirm that the images reflect the actual contents of the ballots ... it 's an issue .
I think the most practical solution is having members of the public invited to attend the scanning sessions ( or filming sessions , ' cam'ing sessions , or whatever ) , able to confirm that the contents of the generated physical artifact ( DVD , filmstrip , or whatever ) , as replayed on THEIR computer ( slide projector , whatever ) , matches photocopies of a random sampling of the ballots being scanned .
Because the Humboldt project prints a serial number on each ballot as it is scanned , this check is easily implemented .
We 've already done this ourselves , though we think of ourselves as the " members of the public , " since that 's who we are .
Finally , I 'd like to redirect attention to what I still think is the critical point you made : unless you are willing to put your faith in the one entity doing the counting , you have to have two or more entities counting to know if the count is correct .
Airplanes and space flight use data from three instruments for critical information ; when one does n't agree with the other two , it 's taken out of service .
This is common sense in many fields ; just not ( yet ) in elections .
We 'll get there .

Canadian experience and some ways to improve the Humbolt
election transparency process I 've been a DRO ( poll judge ) at federal , provincial and local elections in Canada .
My only concern was making sure I did n't screw up running the poll or counting the ballots .
I think that 's going to be primary concern of local election officials .
All we want to do is get the job done without anybody complaining .
That 's why election officials want to use systems that eliminate human intervention or discretion .
--- touch screens are better than scanned ballots , scanned ballots are better than punch cards , punch cards are better than hand counted paper ballots .
At one time , I liked the idea of touch screen voting that when complete printed out a paper ballot that the voter could see before it was dropped in a ballot box .
I do n't like that now .
I do n't like hand counting of paper ballots where there are a lot of offices to vote for ( President , senator , representative , governor ...... dog catcher ) .
Although there are problems with handicapped voters , my preference is paper ballots electronically scanned at the polling place .
That 's standard .
But you can answer a lot of problems if you add that all ballots cast have their images scanned an put on the internet .
See below for details .
Currently , provincial and federal elections still use paper ballots .
Local election methods vary , with the most popular method using large paper ballots that are counted by a scanner .
FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL
Federal and provincial elections are easy .
There 's only one person to elect , some who represents your riding ( what 's called a district in the US ) .
Ballots are almost all black with candidates names and party affiliation printed in white .
After each candidate there a white circle .
Behind a privacy screen is a large pencil like a carpenter 's pencil .
You count a vote if there 's a mark in just one circle ( X preferred ) .
They do n't have to use the pencil .
If they put identifying info on the ballot , it is n't counted .
Even with 2 election officials ( DRO and poll clerk ) and representatives of candidates , a smart DRO can get ballots counted and call the riding ( district ) office with results in under 30 minutes .
LOCAL Elections
When local elections used and counted paper ballots , it was much harder .
The ballot could be a 18 inches wide and 24 inches long with 6 to 8 different offices to vote for .
After the poll closed , it took a lot longer to identify problem ballots and then count up everything .
I was still one of the fastest back to the ward election office .
I did it once and never did it again --- it 's difficult not to make a mistake .
So this is similar to US elections where you can have a lot of offices to vote for .
But there are n't so many offices that they can't all fit on one large ballot on one side of the ballot paper .
That 's why they 've changed to paper ballots counted by scanner .
After you mark the ballot , the ballot inside a secrecy holder is fed into the scanner .
If there 's problems with how the ballot is marked , the ballot is spit back into the holder and the voter can correct it or get a replacement ballot .
City of Toronto estimated this method took at peak times 24 seconds per voter .
Changing the process
Aside from handicapped concerns , the present paper ballot method works great for federal and provincial elections .
It 's easy to hand count ballots and if there 's issues then the ballots can be counted again .
Nor are they likely to change the methods for local elections as there just is n't that much concern if one mayor or another gets elected .
ADDING TRANSPARENCY TO ELECTRONIC COUNTING OF PAPER BALLOTS
I 'm pretty sure this has been thought of already .
Is there a good way to leverage the internet to make checking the imaged ballots less painful ?
Yes , turn verifying ballots into some type of captcha process as is now done to have humans decide what a word from a book is when the scanner could n't figure it out .
So a human sees a ballot image accompanied by how it was counted .
They can agree or disagree with how it was counted .
If enough people see the same ballot and disagree with how it would be counted , then it gets kicked aside for careful scrutiny .
You can control abuse by requiring some minimum / maximum per IP address and rejecting anyone whose count of ballots varies from the machine count by more than a couple of percent .
And there 's lots of people looking at the same ballot .

I have always taken one issue with making scanned ballots available to the public .
I do not see how you could prevent subtle stray marks that could be used to identify a particular person 's ballot .
I 've been told that this is not an issue ; that mail - in ballots have far more potential for vote - buying or coercion .
However , I doubt strongly that mail - in ballots represent the standard we should beat in order to have election integrity .
I have not heard a convincing argument that shows how scanned ballots available to public view would not be vulnerable to being identified by biased parties that have purchased votes or threatened voters to vote a certain way and use a subtle stray mark to identify the ballot .
This may not be a very practical way to tip an election , but if we are going to protect the secret ballot , let 's do so .

... Lora said on 9/18/2009 @ 7:36 pm PT ... Worried about subtle marks on ballots .
Off the top of my head , why not limit the quality of the scans and the valid ways to mark a ballot .
You 've got to decide ahead of time what you 're worried about and what 's the purpose of checking whether the ballots were scanned correctly .
My view is that putting images of paper ballots online is to ( 1 ) increase public confidence that the votes are counted reasonably properly ( 2 ) determine the accuracy of the scanner and its software and ( 3 ) help identify ballots that are questionable and the number of those ballots .
If there are enough ballots in dispute then it triggers a manual recount with the advantage that questionable ballots will have been mostly identified .
This is all a back up procedure .
Anyhow , the real problems as Minnesota illustrated come from absentee ballots .
From anti-fraud view , absentee and mail ballots should be discouraged as much as possible .

Shel ,
That sounds good .
AFter thinking about this , I picture a plexiglass sheet that fits over the paper ballot with openings only where a ballot might be marked to vote .
Everyone uses the same kind of pen .
Agreed that mail - in ballots and absentee ballots in general are a very weak link in the chain of election integrity and ought to be discouraged .

Meg Whitman is the next sarah palin !!!
Fallout from Whitman voting controversy may be lasting
By Steven Harmon
Contra Costa Times
09/30/2009
" Her reply to a KGO caller 's question Wednesday is helping to keep the controversy alive .
When asked whether she had voted before 2002 , she said , " So the answer is that I do n't think the Sacramento Bee article is entirely accurate , but actually it does n't really matter because my voting record is not good . "
The Poizner campaign seized on the comment , pressing her to reveal what she thinks was inaccurate .
Jarrod Agen , a campaign spokesman , said the issue is not going away .
" She 's had a complete lack of transparency with voters and the press on this , " he said .
" She 's told multiple conflicting stories as to the why and when that that creates a problem because she 's not being honest .
This will last until they answer the question of did she vote before 2002 and , if not , why ? " "

Simple ...
Just have a printout with the number of votes before yours , and totaled after yours , with your vote clearly Identifiable .
Also , have a machine receipt number , and a voter number ...
This is IF machines were used .
Also , these results should be made available to everyone online , in real - time .
We do n't need a tally counter if we have real time results , which IS possible today and would n't really matter for voters .
It would n't matter that much in real time and to say that some would see their candidate losing , then go to the poll to vote , so what ...
That is THEIR right to vote if they only do it once .
All this secrecy in a Constitutional Republic , code - named democracy , is not necessary .
That is my opinion ... but , anyway , always use paper ballots and get a copy .

Even before he was the Maricopa County sheriff , Joe Arpaio 's brand of politics was combative and aggressive , personal and bold .
He held grudges .
He lashed out at perceived enemies .
He has faced criticisms of using official investigations as vendettas against rivals and detractors for 30 years , dating to his days as the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency 's top official in Arizona .
In recent years , though , Arpaio 's made - for - TV style of politics and his characteristic braggadocio have taken on a more menacing tone , say longtime observers and adversaries .
They say the sheriff , emboldened by strong poll numbers , years of political victories and often - glowing national attention , has crossed the line from a hard - nosed , media - savvy politician to an intimidating lawman who many think is abusing his office .
They express worries , sometimes half - joking , sometimes not , about the sheriff tapping their phones , bugging their offices and having them followed in unmarked surveillance cars .
" Anyone who raises an issue is subject to phone calls from senior officials in his department , advising them that that 's not a wise thing to do , " Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon , a Democrat and outspoken Arpaio critic , said .
" If they continue comments that the sheriff does n't agree with , people find themselves under criminal investigation or buried with Freedom of Information
Act requests that would cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of dollars . "
Arpaio , a Republican , says he has n't done anything wrong .
Federal authorities are taking complaints , made by Democrats and Republicans alike , seriously .
Multiple sources have told The Arizona Republic that they 've talked to the FBI about whether Arpaio has abused his office with politically motivated investigations .
The Department of Justice separately is looking into whether his deputies use racial profiling in controversial anti- illegal - immigration sweeps .
And the Department of Labor is looking into whether Arpaio 's office wrongfully denied overtime pay to county detention officers .
Arpaio , 77 , initially said he welcomed outside scrutiny , but in July announced that his office would stop cooperating with the Justice Department until it shares details of the probe .
He dismisses other criticisms as paranoia and scoffs at talk of an FBI investigation while defending his own inquiries as legitimate .
" There 's no such thing as ' abuse of power ' - there 's no law against that , " Arpaio said .
" All this garbage that we 're following people around .
This has been going on for 17 years .
Am I paranoid ?
No .
You know why I 'm not paranoid ?
Because it 's not true .
We have nothing to hide .
Why is everybody else paranoid around here ?
Because we 're looking into allegations . "
One political scientist said the national drama unfolding around Arpaio is not surprising , given the sheriff 's years - in - the - making national and international reputation and his aggressive enforcement of immigration laws .
" Certainly , Joe Arpaio has pushed the envelope on very sensitive issues that have constituencies that are mobilized and so he becomes a target , " said Fred Solop , chairman of the politics and international affairs department at Northern Arizona University .
" It is unusual for a county sheriff to have the kind of reputation he does in the first place and it is unusual for the investigations to take place at the level they 're taking .
. . .
But clearly he has been very bold in his actions and that 's merited a bold response . "
Early feud
Personality - driven " feuds " date to Arpaio 's days running the DEA 's Phoenix office .
So do allegations of publicity - mongering .
When he came to Phoenix in 1978 , Arpaio replaced Phil Jordan , the special agent in charge of the office since 1971 .
Jordan , who was popular with local newspaper reporters , was transferred to Albuquerque .
In February 1981 , the DEA announced Jordan would be demoted because of a number of minor infractions that took place while he was in Phoenix , including an allegation of improperly letting a Republic reporter examine sensitive documents related to closed cases .
Jordan fought the demotion , arguing that he was the focus of an agency vendetta by Arpaio .
Jordan told the Phoenix Gazette at the time that he'd been feuding with Arpaio since 1973 , when Arpaio was the DEA 's regional director in Mexico City .
He accused Arpaio of orchestrating a sham investigation to discredit him .
Arpaio was jealous of his superior record and frequent appearances in the local papers , Jordan said at the time .
Arpaio denied the allegations , contemporaneous news accounts said , but in June 1981 Jordan 's demotion was reversed .
A federal Merit Systems Protection Board examiner dismissed the DEA 's charge that he disclosed unauthorized information and downplayed the other infractions as " minimal , " The Republic reported .
Jordan later became director of the DEA's El Paso Intelligence Center , overseeing more than 300 federal employees .
Soon after becoming sheriff in 1993 , Arpaio , now in his fifth term , began publicly - and constantly - grappling with Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley , the county 's top prosecutor .
They clashed hard in 1993 after Romley publicly criticized as unconstitutional an Arpaio plan to set up roadblocks around Maricopa County and stop incoming cars to search for drugs .
The " feud , " as the media usually characterized it , continued until Romley left office in 2005 .
" Unfortunately from my perspective , those types of issues were portrayed as a personal thing between Romley and Arpaio , " Romley said .
" And he 's masterful at that .
Rather than the merits of the argument being discussed , it always seemed to be a personality fight . "
After Romley left office , Arpaio began expanding his list of his high - profile combatants to include Gordon , Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox and Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard , three Democrats who either have been or still are under investigation by the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office .
As an elected official , Arpaio is autonomous and does not report to the Board of Supervisors or any other official , although the supervisors set his budget .
His office also helped bring criminal charges against longtime Supervisor Don Stapley , a Republican , and Arpaio remains largely estranged from the three Republicans who make up the rest of the five - member board , which also is under investigation .
Over the years , Arpaio 's inquiries have rattled Maricopa County Superior Court officials , county administrators and employees , and political candidates who have unsuccessfully run against him .
" It is not a partisan issue .
It 's a do - you - support - Joe - Arpaio issue , " said Romley , a Republican .
" If you support Joe Arpaio , it does n't matter if you 're a ' D ' or an ' R , ' you 're OK .
If you 're against Joe Arpaio , it does n't matter if you 're a ' D ' or an ' R , ' either . "
Many investigations
There is a long list of examples of Arpaio 's administration formally investigating - some say trying to intimidate or harass - political rivals , adversaries or critics .
The sheriff has allied himself with current Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas , also a Republican illegal - immigration foe .
Arpaio said that since he and Thomas created their joint Maricopa County 's Anti-Corruption Effort , known as MACE , in early 2007 , tipsters know that they have an agency that will take public - corruption allegations seriously .
Arpaio says he pursues investigations as aggressively as he can , so he can , if appropriate , clear the accused person as soon as possible .
" If we get information , which we do , on allegations and I throw it in the waste basket , I 'm not doing my job , " Arpaio said .
" So why is everybody paranoid ? "
David Hendershott , Arpaio 's chief deputy , adds : " Most people under investigation do n't like the fact that they 're under investigation , but it is what it is . "
Arpaio 's office does n't have much of a history of closing high - profile investigations of public officials - investigations can remain open for months or even years with no resolution .
For example , Arpaio announced in April 2007 that he was investigating the Arizona Attorney General 's Office 's prosecution of former Republican state Treasurer David Petersen .
The Sheriff 's Office requested information that required the Attorney General 's Office to produce more than 73,000 pages of documents , but Goddard has heard little for more than a year , Goddard spokeswoman Anne Hilby said .
But Arpaio did conclude an eight - month investigation into Gordon with the arrest of the man who made the original , ultimately baseless criminal allegation : Jarrett Maupin II , a civil - rights activist and political adversary of Gordon's .
Maupin later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in connection with the allegation he made about Gordon .
" I do get a sense that there is a willingness to intimidate , to threaten , individuals , " Romley said .
" Very subtly , not super - overt , but it 's enough to get people nervous and thinking , ' Geez , I do n't want Joe Arpaio knocking on my door at midnight . '
You could be indicted and you may be innocent , but you 're going to go through hell for several years of your life , especially financially . "
Thomas clearly has a better relationship with Arpaio than Romley did but is not involved in every Arpaio investigation , said Barnett Lotstein , a special assistant county attorney who works for Thomas and had the same role under Romley .
Generally speaking , Lotstein said , public officials under investigation commonly cry political persecution and usually those allegations prove inaccurate in the end .
" I think the Sheriff 's Office is a professional law - enforcement organization and until these accusations are proven , all they are are mere accusations , " Lotstein said .
" It 's well - known that Mr. Romley and the sheriff did n't get along when he was in office , so it does n't surprise me that he would be critical at this point . "
Thomas defended the MACE investigations , such as the outstanding Attorney General 's Office one , as legitimate , echoing that such cases can be tricky because the defendants often are politicians .
" That dynamic does need to be taken into account when one considers all the controversy that is stirred up by public - corruption prosecutions , " he said .
Jon Beydler knows how that feels to be in the sheriff 's sights .
The former Fountain Hills mayor flatly says Arpaio " should be in jail " for what he did to his family .
In 2002 , the Sheriff 's Office investigated Beydler for child neglect after his 4 - year - old daughter locked herself in his car .
Beydler maintains Arpaio , a Fountain Hills resident , trumped up the case because Beydler had run for mayor on a platform of replacing the town 's sheriff 's office contract with a new local police service .
The case went nowhere , but it generated embarrassing publicity for Beydler and helped fuel a recall effort that eventually ousted the mayor .
" It was nothing but another example of Arpaio ruining , or attempting to ruin , competitors ' lives if they got in his way , " Beydler said .
" He conjured up this so - called child - abuse charge because my little girl locked herself in the car for a few minutes .
He turned it into a full - scale investigation .
He invaded my offices with police officers , with weapons , confiscating my business records and videotapes .
Basically an intimidation act . "
Arpaio has denied political motivation in the Beydler case .
Friends and former friends
Arpaio has turned many former friends into enemies .
Gordon and Wilcox said they both considered themselves allies of Arpaio in the past .
Arpaio volunteered that he has had long , positive relationships with Goddard , a former Phoenix mayor , and former Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano , whom the sheriff recently has sharply criticized in her role as President Barack Obama 's Homeland Security secretary .
It strains credulity , Gordon said , to suggest so many of Arpaio 's friends have gone bad .
" What 's the only thing in the equation that 's different ?
It 's him , " he said .
Wilcox said their " very good friendship " changed after Arpaio became a crusader against illegal immigration .
Previously , Arpaio had no conflicts with the immigrant community , understanding from his DEA days that there " always is an ebb and flow of the workforce across the border , " Wilcox said .
Arpaio would attend Wilcox 's midnight basketball games for at - risk youths and never asked the kids about - or even showed any interest in - their immigration status , she said .
The late - night hoops program was created to keep youths on the courts and off the streets , where they could get into trouble with drugs , gangs and crime .
" Arpaio always tried to portray toughness , but it always was in fun .
He 'd say , ' I 'm the world 's toughest sheriff , ' but it was n't mean - spirited , " said Wilcox , who has worked with Arpaio since 1993 .
Since parting ways with him on immigration - enforcement policy , her business finances have come under investigation by the Sheriff 's Office .
" The sad thing of it is , I think it 's done for publicity , " she said .
" Sometimes I feel like sitting down with him and saying , ' Sheriff , come on , bring the old Arpaio back . '
But I think it 's long gone . "
Heavy hitting
Where political adversaries are involved , Arpaio 's law - enforcement agency often is quick to react - or overreact .
In 2002 , sheriff 's deputies arrested actor Nick Tarr on the charge of impersonating a police officer .
Tarr at the time was playing the role of " Joe Arizona , " the television spokesman for a statewide ballot measure sponsored by racetracks .
Arpaio backed and cut a TV ad for a competing gaming proposition pushed by 17 Indian tribes .
Hendershott saw Tarr campaigning in downtown Phoenix in a ridiculous outfit of pink boxer shorts , a ranger - style hat , an unbuttoned khaki shirt with state Department of Public Safety patches and a T - shirt reading " I ( heart ) Arizona " and directed deputies to investigate .
Tarr was not prosecuted but alleged his acting career was damaged .
County supervisors agreed in 2008 to settle his lawsuit for $ 125,000 .
Candidates who have unsuccessfully opposed Arpaio in past elections also have complained of harassment .
Dan Saban , who ran against Arpaio once as a Republican and once as Democrat , went as far as suing Arpaio and Hendershott for defamation but lost .
During the 2004 race , Arpaio 's office opened a rape investigation into Saban .
Hendershott had told a Channel 15 ( KNXV ) news reporter about the case .
Authorities in Pima County , where the investigation was moved , decided the 1970s - era allegation against Saban was too old to pursue .
In 2008 , Arpaio sent 60 deputies and posse members with bulletproof vests and semi-automatic weapons into Mesa City Hall and the Mesa Public Library for a predawn immigration - related raid .
Arpaio publicly had sparred with local leaders , including then - Mesa Police Chief George Gasc�n , who had asked for at least two days ' notice of any sweeps .
The target of the operation : the overnight cleaning company .
Mesa officials denounced the incident as an egregious political scare tactic .
Earlier this month , deputies took control of a county computer system integral to ongoing litigation between the Sheriff 's Office and the county supervisors , threatening to arrest county workers if they interfered .
Dennis DeConcini , the former three - term Democratic senator from Arizona who served on the Senate Judiciary Committee , has known Arpaio since his DEA days and considers him " a real cop . "
He even praised Arpaio as " tenacious , dedicated and determined " in a blurb that appeared on the dust jacket of Arpaio 's 1996 book , " America 's Toughest Sheriff : How We Can Win the War Against Crime . "
But DeConcini said he is particularly troubled by Arpaio 's investigation of Wilcox and her husband , Earl , and is hoping that Arpaio , who supported DeConcini 's 1982 re-election , has n't overstepped his authority in going after political figures who cross him .
" I 'd like to think that he is above that , " said DeConcini , who served as Pima County attorney before ascending to the Senate .
" If he is n't - if he is n't - he 's making a huge mistake . "

One more reason for me to be enjoy the fact that he 's the current governor of my homestate .
I 'm just annoyed I can expect to get back to CA after he hands over the duty to someone who'd be far less fun to watch walking up to a podium during a green technology promotion !
It 's the hot new thing on Wall Street , a way for a handful of traders to master the stock market , peek at investors ' orders and , critics say , even subtly manipulate share prices .
It is called high - frequency trading -- and it is suddenly one of the most talked - about and mysterious forces in the markets .
Powerful computers , some housed right next to the machines that drive marketplaces like the New York Stock Exchange , enable high - frequency traders to transmit millions of orders at lightning speed and , their detractors contend , reap billions at everyone else 's expense .
These systems are so fast they can outsmart or outrun other investors , humans and computers alike .
And after growing in the shadows for years , they are generating lots of talk .
Nearly everyone on Wall Street is wondering how hedge funds and large banks like Goldman Sachs are making so much money so soon after the financial system nearly collapsed .
High - frequency trading is one answer .
-- Joseph M. Mecane , NYSE Euronext
" It 's become a technological arms race , and what separates winners and losers is how fast they can move . "
And when a former Goldman Sachs programmer was accused this month of stealing secret computer codes -- software that a federal prosecutor said could " manipulate markets in unfair ways " -- it only added to the mystery .
Goldman acknowledges that it profits from high - frequency trading , but disputes that it has an unfair advantage .
Yet high - frequency specialists clearly have an edge over typical traders , let alone ordinary investors .
The Securities and Exchange Commission says it is examining certain aspects of the strategy .
" This is where all the money is getting made , " said William H. Donaldson , former chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange and today an adviser to a big hedge fund .
" If an individual investor does n't have the means to keep up , they 're at a huge disadvantage . "
For most of Wall Street 's history , stock trading was fairly straightforward : buyers and sellers gathered on exchange floors and dickered until they struck a deal .
Then , in 1998 , the Securities and Exchange Commission authorized electronic exchanges to compete with marketplaces like the New York Stock Exchange .
The intent was to open markets to anyone with a desktop computer and a fresh idea .
But as new marketplaces have emerged , PCs have been unable to compete with Wall Street 's computers .
Powerful algorithms --" algos , " in industry parlance -- execute millions of orders a second and scan dozens of public and private marketplaces simultaneously .
They can spot trends before other investors can blink , changing orders and strategies within milliseconds .
High - frequency traders often confound other investors by issuing and then canceling orders almost simultaneously .
Loopholes in market rules give high - speed investors an early glance at how others are trading .
And their computers can essentially bully slower investors into giving up profits -- and then disappear before anyone even knows they were there .
High - frequency traders also benefit from competition among the various exchanges , which pay small fees that are often collected by the biggest and most active traders -- typically a quarter of a cent per share to whoever arrives first .
Those small payments , spread over millions of shares , help high - speed investors profit simply by trading enormous numbers of shares , even if they buy or sell at a modest loss .
" It 's become a technological arms race , and what separates winners and losers is how fast they can move , " said Joseph M. Mecane of NYSE Euronext , which operates the New York Stock Exchange .
" Markets need liquidity , and high - frequency traders provide opportunities for other investors to buy and sell . "
The rise of high - frequency trading helps explain why activity on the nation 's stock exchanges has exploded .
Average daily volume has soared by 164 percent since 2005 , according to data from NYSE .
Although precise figures are elusive , stock exchanges say that a handful of high - frequency traders now account for more than half of all trades .
To understand this high - speed world , consider what happened when slow - moving traders went up against high - frequency robots earlier this month , and ended up handing spoils to lightning - fast computers .
It was July 15 , and Intel , the computer chip giant , had reported robust earnings the night before .
Some investors , smelling opportunity , set out to buy shares in the semiconductor company Broadcom .
( Their activities were described by an investor at a major Wall Street firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his job . )
The slower traders faced a quandary :
If they sought to buy a large number of shares at once , they would tip their hand and risk driving up Broadcom 's price .
So , as is often the case on Wall Street , they divided their orders into dozens of small batches , hoping to cover their tracks .
One second after the market opened , shares of Broadcom started changing hands at $ 26.20 .
The slower traders began issuing buy orders .
But rather than being shown to all potential sellers at the same time , some of those orders were most likely routed to a collection of high - frequency traders for just 30 milliseconds -- 0.03 seconds -- in what are known as flash orders .
While markets are supposed to ensure transparency by showing orders to everyone simultaneously , a loophole in regulations allows marketplaces like Nasdaq to show traders some orders ahead of everyone else in exchange for a fee .
In less than half a second , high - frequency traders gained a valuable insight : the hunger for Broadcom was growing .
Their computers began buying up Broadcom shares and then reselling them to the slower investors at higher prices .
The overall price of Broadcom began to rise .
Soon , thousands of orders began flooding the markets as high - frequency software went into high gear .
Automatic programs began issuing and canceling tiny orders within milliseconds to determine how much the slower traders were willing to pay .
The high - frequency computers quickly determined that some investors ' upper limit was $ 26.40 .
The price shot to $ 26.39 , and high - frequency programs began offering to sell hundreds of thousands of shares .
The result is that the slower - moving investors paid $ 1.4 million for about 56,000 shares , or $ 7,800 more than if they had been able to move as quickly as the high - frequency traders .
Multiply such trades across thousands of stocks a day , and the profits are substantial .
High - frequency traders generated about $ 21 billion in profits last year , the Tabb Group , a research firm , estimates .
" You want to encourage innovation , and you want to reward companies that have invested in technology and ideas that make the markets more efficient , " said Andrew M. Brooks , head of United States equity trading at T. Rowe Price , a mutual fund and investment company that often competes with and uses high - frequency techniques .
" But we 're moving toward a two - tiered marketplace of the high - frequency arbitrage guys , and everyone else .
People want to know they have a legitimate shot at getting a fair deal .
Otherwise , the markets lose their integrity . "

Flash Forward
ABC has been promoting this show like crazy and trying to make it seem like the next Lost .
This show definitely has the most buzz out of the new shows , but the first episode will get huge ratings .
I would n't be surprised if it got over a 4.5 for 18 - 49 .
The trailers look pretty good , but I 'm not sure if the producers will be able to milk 6 seasons out of this like the producers of Lost did .
People blackout out for 2 minutes 17 seconds ( the trailers have ingrained that into my brain ) and see 6 months into the future .
People deal with what they see or did n't see .
The problem I see is that 6 months is such a short time , that it would be weird if a couple seasons happened in that amount of time .
Maybe the show will extend beyond the 6 months so we see if the visions are actually true .
There 's lots of directions to go in , so we should n't be too worried .
Expect a renewal here .
V
I will probably be reviewing the show for BSCreview.com , so check out my reviews there when the show starts in November .
I 'm a fan of the original miniseries , The Final Battle ( the second miniseries ) , and I watched the original series which admittedly is pretty bad .
Instead of the in your face Nazi allegory of the 80's , the remake seems to be focusing on faith and devotion .
With a cast geared toward scifi fans ( Elizabeth Mitchell , Morena Baccarin , Laura Vandervoort ) , the show will gain a loyal following , but will the mainstream follow ?
Perhaps the show is too science fiction with the aliens and spaceships , but the trailers were simply epic .
The trailer was the most amazing one if seen in years .
I want to believe in a renewal , so I 'll have to say this will be renewed .
Eastwick
Based on a film and book of almost the same name , this show features Rebecca Romijn as the main character .
The trailers were n't very impressive and I do n't like the concept at all .
Maybe the show will get a high female demo , but other than that I will horrible ratings here and an early cancellation .
The Forgotten
This has been promoted a fair amount , but the response has been tepid at most .
Jerry Bruckheimer has another crime drama and this time it 's not about police or FBI !!
Just a bunch of amateurs trying to do good in the world .
I may be the only one slightly interested in this show .
I was watching the trailer and did n't care much for it until they showed the part with the guy taking a picture inside a store .
I 'm not sure what , possibly the dialogue , but I became interested .
I 'm expecting so - so ratings , so it will be somewhere in the canceled to on the bubble area .
The Deep End
It 's not scheduled for the fall , so I 'm guessing there 's no much confidence from the network .
I have n't heard much about the show and the trailer was uninspiring .
It 's a little too early to make any judgments yet , but if I had to choose , I would go with cancellation .
Happy Town
Looks like a modern day Twin Peaks , so it should be interesting .
The problem is that trailer was bland .
I do n't really see the appeal of the show except for Amy Acker who deserves to be the star of her own show .
Hopefully the show is better than the trailer indicates , because this is heading for bad ratings .
Cougar Town
ABC trying to build a comedy block on Wednesdays , but will it succeed ?
Courteney
Cox stars in this show about ... cougars .
Does that seem plainly self - indulgent to anyone ?
I thought the trailer was average and I 'm not seeing lots of talk about the show .
I do n't think ABC 's comedy Wednesdays will succeed and neither will this show .
Verdict : Cancellation is on the horizon .
Hank
Kelsey Grammer is back in a comedy about a rich guy who loses it all .
There seems to be a lot of bad reviews for the pilot , and the trailer was n't too funny .
Also a cancellation .
The Middle
There is one word to describe the trailer : annoying .
Patricia Heaton and Neil Flynn are big in the comedy TV world , but this was the best the producers could come up with ?
ABC 's comedy block looks to be a failure with yet another cancellation here .
Modern Family
Out of ABC 's new comedies , Modern Family has the best chance to survive .
Critics love it and there is substantial buzz for the show .
I 've already reviewed the pilot , if you want to see my thoughts on it .
I 'm guessing this show will be on the bubble and will go either way .

Nur noch fünf Prozent der Deutschen glauben , dass sie Politik durch Wahlen maßgeblich mitbestimmen können .
Volksherrschaft ist zur Zuschauerdemokratie verkommen .
Das ruft nach direkter Demokratie - und gibt auch der CSU recht .
Von Hans - Ulrich Jörges
Das Vertrauen ins demokratische Ideal ist zur Restgröße verkümmert .
Nur noch fünf Prozent der Deutschen glauben , sie könnten die Politik durch Wahlen in starkem Maße mitbestimmen .
38 Prozent halten das gar nicht für möglich .
57 Prozent , ergab eine Forsa - Erhebung für den stern , sind der Meinung , durch Wahlen könne man wenigstens etwas mitbestimmen .
Völlig desillusioniert sind Arbeiter .
Dass sie die Politik durch Wahlen maßgeblich beeinflussen könnten , meinen null Prozent .
Null !
Das ist der Offenbarungseid der repräsentativen Demokratie nach 60 Jahren Republik und Grundgesetz .
Mitten im " Superwahljahr " .
Drei Viertel der Deutschen sind überzeugt , so die bestürzende Erhebung , dass die Politik auf die Interessen des Volkes keine Rücksicht nimmt .
Das speist sich aus prägenden Erfahrungen mit der gewucherten Parteienherrschaft - wie jener , dass die Union vor der Wahl 2005 eine Mehrwertsteuererhöhung um zwei Punkte annoncierte , die SPD dies vehement ablehnte - und man sich am Ende auf drei Prozent einigte .
Logik der Politik : 2 + 0 = 3 . Fürs Kalkül der Parteien war das ein Fliegenschiss in der Geschichte , für Wähler unvergesslich .
Das Volk fühlt sich entmündigt .
Und es ist entmündigt .
Allein der Bundestag ist unmittelbar vom Wahlvolk legitimiert ( auf Länderebene die Landtage ) .
Alle anderen Verfassungsorgane , Präsident und Kanzler ( in ) voran , leiten ihre Legitimation davon ab .
Verlagern sich die politischen Entscheidungen aber aus dem Parlament in Machtzirkel und Koalitionsrunden , die das Grundgesetz gar nicht kennt , wird der Bundestag also kaltgestellt und nur noch nachträglich zur formalen Absegnung missbraucht , ist Politik de facto demokratiefrei .
" Selbst dort , wo Länder dem Volk direkte Entscheidungen zubilligen , wird es mitunter betrogen "
" Entparlamentarisierung " nennt das Verfassungsgerichtspräsident Hans - Jürgen Papier - und urteilt : " Wenn die politische Willensbildung und die materielle Entscheidung nicht im Parlament und nicht im Rahmen parlamentarischer Verfahren stattfinden , verliert das Staatsvolk seine Vertretung und wird der Wahlakt entwertet . "
Deutschland hat ein Demokratiedefizit .
Es ist nur noch Zuschauerdemokratie .
Werden auch noch die Parteien demokratisch entkernt , herrscht die Macht gänzlich freihändig .
Parteitage verkommen zu Inszenierungen , sofern sie überhaupt noch gefragt werden .
CDU und CSU ließen ihr Wahlprogramm unlängst durch eine Versammlung handverlesener Funktionäre ab absegnen .
Ähnliche Nickkonvente abseits der Parteisatzung hatte auch Gerhard Schröder in der SPD in Mode gebracht .
Selbst dort , wo die Länder dem Volk direkte Entscheidung zubilligen , wird es mitunter betrogen .
In Berlin scheiterten Volksentscheide über den Flughafen Tempelhof und Religionsunterricht an den Schulen am Quorum von 25 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten - sie erreichten nur 21,7 und 14,2 Prozent .
Die Hürde aber hatten selbst die Volksparteien bei der Wahl 2006 nicht geschafft : Die SPD kam auf 17,5 , die CDU auf 12,1 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten .
Die tonangebenden Kräfte der Politik haben Angst vor dem Volk .
Und verweigern ihm deshalb unmittelbare Teilhabe .
In weihevollen Feierstunden wurde jüngst der 60 .
Jahrestag des Grundgesetzes bejubelt .
Eigentlich hätte der 20 .
Jahrestag der gesamtdeutschen Verfassung gefeiert werden müssen .
Denn in Artikel 146 des Grundgesetzes war - und ist !
- vorgeschrieben , dass dieses Provisorium nach Wiederherstellung der Einheit durch eine per Volksabstimmung gebilligte Verfassung ersetzt werden muss .
Die Verweigerung ist glatter Verfassungsbruch .
Franz Müntefering , immerhin , lässt das keine Ruhe .
Doch wer nach direkter Demokratie ruft , wird abgekanzelt .
Das ging Horst Köhler so , als er die Direktwahl des Bundespräsidenten vorschlug .
Das geht jetzt der CSU so , die eine strikte Bindung der deutschen Europapolitik ans Parlament verlangt - und Volksabstimmungen , wenn wichtige Kompetenzen auf die EU übertragen oder neue Staaten aufgenommen werden sollen .
Das ist nicht querulatorisch , wie der CSU in steriler Aufregung vorgeworfen wird , das ist richtig .
Denn das Europaparlament , hat das Verfassungsgericht endlich klargestellt , ist nicht vollwertig .
Neben dem deutschen Demokratiedefizit klafft ein noch größeres europäisches .
Die Zeit ist reif für eine durchgreifende Demokratisierung .
Träumen wir mal .
Die Parteien öffnen sich Urwahlen ihres Spitzenpersonals und aller ihrer Kandidaten .
Horst Köhler beruft eine verfassungsgebende Versammlung ein , um zu besprechen , was am Grundgesetz zu ändern wäre : Volksentscheide , Direktwahl des Bundespräsidenten , Wahlrechtsreform mit Zugriff der Bürger auf die Rangfolge der Kandidaten auf Parteilisten .
Und anderes , Länderfusionen zum Beispiel .
Am Ende : Volksabstimmung über die neue Verfassung .
Das wird wohl ein Traum bleiben .
Eines aber muss durchgekämpft werden : die Rückgabe der Herrschaft ans Volk .

How motivation actually works
Motivation comes in waves .
Some days we hop out of bed , ready to take on the world .
We start big projects , dream big dreams , and know that FINALLY we ’re going to accomplish something .
But then , tomorrow comes .
We sit down in the same place we sat yesterday — where we were on fire and ready to go and … nothing .
We look at our Netflix queue or go and buy a cup of coffee .
We ca n’t seem to get that spark back .
That is how motivation works .
So , if we rely on motivation alone , we are setting ourselves up for failure .
What can we do instead ?
One of my mentors , BJ Fogg , who runs the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford , says we should assume that our “ future self ” is going to be lazy with no motivation .
We need to set up systems to make achieving our goals as easy as possible — even when our motivation is low .
In other words :
Motivation DOESN ’T work .
Systems do .
Here ’s how to use systems to keep yourself going even when motivation slumps .
How to motivate yourself step 1 : Plan for failure
Successful people are n’t luckier than most people .
But they do try more things , and they ’re willing to fail .
If you ’re a top performer , chances are you ’ve figured out how to motivate yourself .
For example , my good friend Tim Ferriss was rejected 26 times before a publisher finally accepted his idea for The 4 - Hour Workweek ( that later became a New York Times and Wall Street Journal best - seller ) .
Almost anyone who ’s been successful has a similar story of failure before triumph .
But the difference between average and top performers is that average people are blindsided by failure and give up when it strikes .
Top performers , on the other hand , actively seek out failure because they know success is on the other side .
BJ Fogg and I sat down and talked about how we can use failure and “ motivational waves ” to our advantage so when others tire out we can have a system to follow through .
How you can start using the principle of “ motivational waves ” right now :
Make a list of everything you need to get to accomplish your goal .
Then , set up those pieces to make it impossible to fail .
Here ’s an example what that might look like :
BJ Fogg wanted to drink more tea .
So he bought all the tea , an electric kettle to boil water , and set everything up in easy reach on his counter .
Even when he felt like drinking something else , it was right there and a no - brainer to make .
I was trying to form a gym habit .
I ’d get up in the morning planning to go , but after a few minutes decide not to .
I discovered that if I put my gym clothes and my shoes next to my bed , I would put them on first thing and by that point , I “ might as well ” just go .

How to motivate yourself step 2 : Put it on your calendar
Imagine playing in a basketball game against LeBron James .
We have the best shoes , the most expensive pair of athletics shorts , a fancy headband , and the greatest jersey in the world .
And he has no shoes , ripped shorts , and a dress shirt .
Who would win ?
It sounds ridiculous but we play this same game against motivation every day .
The tools do n’t matter as much as we think .
Novices LOVE to focus on productivity hacks , apps and tools .
It ’s easy — and frankly , more fun — to play with new shiny tools than to simply do what works .
But usually , the fundamentals — things like a simple calendar , pen and paper — work as well if not better than some app .
Take a look at a sample of my calendar system .
See how it ’s not a super advanced set of apps .
I purposely make it easy on myself so I can follow through and easily update it .
EXECUTION is more important than the tactic itself .
How you can start using this motivation system right now :
Decide ahead of time and map out your schedule for the week either on paper or in a simple calendar system .
Set an alert in your calendar or on your phone to review this every week .
Keep thinking ahead and you ’ll never be caught off guard or pressed for time .
How to motivate yourself step 3 : Develop laser - guided focus
In the video above , BJ Fogg talks about “ competing motivations ” — sometimes even our best efforts are thwarted because something else comes along .
Sometimes these are external distractions : an emergency comes up , we have family demands , and work gets busy .
But , just as often , we cannibalize one goal by shifting focus to another .
The result ?
We do n’t make much progress on either .
Developing FOCUS and being able to put some ideas on hold is a skill that almost guarantees we make progress on what matters .
Let me show you what I mean .
One of my close friends , Noah Kagan , a former employee of Mint and Facebook and the founder of AppSumo , showed me the power of having laser - guided focus — he was able to start not one , but two multi-million dollar businesses that continue to see growth year after year .
He does this by setting one big goal at a time .
Watch Noah explain here ( pay particular attention to 3:56 where we talk specifically about how he sets his goals ) :
How you can use this motivation system right now :
Pick your number one goal .
Is it earning more money ?
Getting in shape ?
Finding your Dream Job ?
Grab a pen and paper and write it down .
Really do this now .
This is n’t a silly “ thought exercise . ”
We ’re doing this to commit ourselves to one course of action and follow through .

By Nelson Lund - July 12 , 2009
Second Circuit Judge Sonia Sotomayor recently held that the Constitution does not protect the right to keep and bear arms against infringement by state and local governments .
Her defenders maintain that she was merely applying settled precedent , which only the Supreme Court itself is authorized to reconsider .
This is a half truth that conceals more than it reveals .
Last year , the Supreme Court resolved a longstanding debate by holding that the Second Amendment 's right to keep and bear arms includes the right of American citizens to have weapons for personal self defense .
Accordingly , the Court struck down a D.C. statute that outlawed the possession of handguns .
Since 1833 , it has been settled that the Bill of Rights does not apply to state laws , but only to federal legislation like that involved in the D.C. case .
In 1868 , however , the Fourteenth Amendment imposed new restrictions on the States , forbidding them to abridge the " privileges or immunities " of American citizens or to " deprive any person of life , liberty , or property without due process of law . "
In several nineteenth century cases , the Supreme Court held that the individual liberties protected by the Bill of Rights , including the right to keep and bear arms , are not among the " privileges or immunities " protected against state abridgement by the Fourteenth Amendment .
Whether this was a correct interpretation or not , the Supreme Court has adhered to it ever since , and the lower courts are required to accept it .
In the twentieth century , however , the Supreme Court decided a series of cases in which it concluded that most of the rights protected against the federal government by the Bill of Rights are also " incorporated " against the state governments by the Fourteenth Amendment 's Due Process Clause .
The Court has analyzed each right separately , but the legal test that eventually emerged focuses on the significance of the right at issue in the Anglo - American tradition of ordered liberty .
The Supreme Court has not yet reviewed an incorporation case involving the Second Amendment , but its Second Amendment opinion last year pointedly noted that a due process analysis is now " required " under its twentieth century caselaw .
Judge Sotomayor ignored this instruction from the Supreme Court .
She decided that her court was not required to perform this due process analysis because the nineteenth century decisions under the Privileges or Immunities Clause had settled the issue .
Several circuit courts had reached the same conclusion before last year 's Supreme Court 's decision , and one other circuit court reached the same conclusion just this month .
Her defenders can therefore plausibly argue that her decision was not wildly out of the judicial mainstream .
It is not true , however , that Judge Sotomayor was faithfully following precedent .
The Supreme Court has never said that the Due Process Clause does not " incorporate " the right to keep and bear arms .
That Court has never said that the nineteenth century Privileges or Immunities Clause cases foreclose due process analysis .
Nor has it ever said that the lower courts are supposed to " wait " for the Supreme Court to rule on due process incorporation .
The Supreme Court 's twentieth century incorporation cases are the most relevant precedents , and Judge Sotomayor completely ignored them .
Two months ago , the Ninth Circuit performed a careful analysis of those precedents , and concluded that the right to keep and bear arms is indeed incorporated .
Nor was this the first court to realize that lower courts are required to analyze and apply those precedents .
A number of circuit courts have done so with respect to other individual rights , and none of them has ever been criticized by the Supreme Court .
One illuminating example , from Judge Sotomayor 's own Second Circuit , is a double jeopardy opinion written by then - Judge Thurgood Marshall .
The Supreme Court later cited his opinion favorably , but Judge Sotomayor apparently decided that she did n't even need to consider the precedent he set , let alone the relevant Supreme Court cases .
President Obama has said that he wants judges whose " deepest values " will help them decide the 5 percent cases that are truly difficult .
Judge Sotomayor 's deepest values apparently caused her to ignore the precedents that would have vindicated the right of Americans to have the tools they need to protect themselves from violent criminals .
Can anyone expect that to change if she is confirmed to the Supreme Court ?
Police are checking the doors and waking people up if they can get in
Police in Liverpool have tried to " break into " 3,500 homes to check people are locking up at night .
Officers are testing front and back doors in burglary hotspots in Everton and Woolton and waking residents if the doors are unlocked .
So far they have successfully opened 66 doors and spotted 14 open windows .
In Liverpool North , which includes Everton , there were 316 burglaries in just one month , nearly half the figure for the whole of Merseyside .
' Terrible shock '
Police have said that people who have been woken up after leaving their door open have , on the whole , given a positive response .
One said : " It gave me a terrible shock , but it is such a good idea .
" It has made me much more aware of making sure I lock the door .
" My son had been out and he'd left the door unlocked . "
Police community support officers will then visit the property the following day and issue crime prevention advice .
A police spokeswoman said : " Particularly vulnerable premises are ' target hardened ' with window alarms , door alarms , locks and crime prevention tools like SmartWater . "
Police are also targeting known prolific burglars .
Each suspect is allocated a specific officer and are visited every day until they are either arrested or police are satisfied they are no longer committing crimes .

" We are still reaching out to companies whose ads we see during Beck 's nightly program , " Rucker continued .
" Based on the fact that many of the recent ads on Beck 's program are for gold coins and News Corp properties , it looks like Fox News Channel is struggling to place advertisements on Beck 's show . "
" We could not be happier with the results of our campaign so far , " said James Rucker , Executive Director of ColorOfChange.org .
" All 46 companies that have distanced themselves from Glenn Beck should be applauded for their stance . "
Three of the latest defections -- Travelers Insurance , Bell & Howell and DirecTv-- join the list of advertisers who claim to have already placed Glenn Beck 's program on a " do not air " list , but whose ads have been seen on Beck 's program , apparently against their wishes .
Over 170,000 people have now signed our petition to Glenn Beck 's advertisers , and it 's working .
Here are statements from the new companies distancing themselves from Beck :
" As mentioned before , Applebee 's regularly evaluates where our advertising appears , " said Miles McMillin , a spokesperson for Applebee 's Services , Inc. , in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
" We strive to reach our diverse group of consumers in many different advertising venues .
We do advertise in programming where various opinions are debated as we believe discussion about issues important to our country is very valuable .
We expect this discussion to be respectful .
As also pointed out earlier , we have not purchased advertising time on the Glenn Beck show specifically .
However , at this time , we have asked that our advertising that appears on FOX News not be included on the Glenn Beck program . "
In an email conversation with ColorOfChange.org , Joseph L. Goode , Senior Vice - President of Global Media Relations for Bank of America , confirmed that a statement posted on MediaMatters.org was authentic and that any advertisement placed on the Glenn Beck Program was an error and they would take steps to correct it .
" We do n't advertise on Glenn Beck 's show anymore , " said Charlie Sahner , a spokesperson for Vonage , in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
" I can confirm the authenticity of the statement published on http://jenkinsear.com/... " , said Valérie Moens , Senior Manager of Corporate Affairs for Kraft Foods Inc. , in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
" Kraft Foods has made the decision to stop advertising on the more politically extreme programs on all networks .
In recent years , there has been a proliferation of shows with extreme content , including on the political front .
These shows often are controversial and do not align with our company or brand values .
That 's why we have made the decision to stop advertising on the more politically extreme programs on all networks . "
" We 're not an advertiser , that I can tell you , " said Tom Forsythe , Vice - President of Corporate Communications for General Mills , in a phone conversation with ColorOfChange.org .
" It 's not necessarily in response to your campaign .
The action has much more to do with the content of the program ... Upon hearing your request , I made sure that that was true .
But it should have already been true because of the nature of the show . "
In an email to ColorOfChange.org , Jon Gieselman , Senior Vice - President of Advertising and Public Relations for DirecTV , Inc. , confirmed that their ads should not be running on Glenn Beck 's program .
" We have actually not purchased national advertising from Fox News during his show since August 3rd , and right now we do n't have plans to purchase media in the future , " Gieselman said .
" We have already clarified our position with Fox News . "
" To be clear , the Glenn Beck program has never been part of our advertising effort , " said Frank Colangelo , Director of Advertising Research for Travelers Insurance , in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
" Any Travelers advertisements that ran during that program in the past were due to commercial placement mistakes by Fox News .
In fact we have a standing " no buy " policy with regard to the program and we have confirmed that fact with Fox News . "
" We 've discontinued our advertising on this program and do n't plan to resume , " said Scott M. Peters , Chief Marketing Officer for Regions Financial Corporation , in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
" Our company , SAM ( Store and Move ) has complied with your request and " The Glenn beck " show has been put on the " do not air " list for SAM , " said Nicole Henkel , a spokesperson for SAM ( Store and Move ) , in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
" While our distributor controls advertising , we have no plans for ads on this [ Glenn Beck 's ] program , " said Hank D'Ambrosio , Vice - President of Administration for Bell & Howell , in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
" As I said to you in our conversation and reiterated in my conversation with our distributor , in our 102 year history , Bell and Howell has never been involved in politics or in anything that could be construed as discriminatory in any way and never will . "

Social Networking giant mySpace has responded to questions over censorship of the now iconic Obama as The Joker image by denying they have removed it from any users ’ pages or photo albums .
Last week we reported on the fact that many MySpace users were contacting us with evidence that the Newscorp owned website is effectively censoring their political views by removing their “ Jokerbama ” images and threatening to disable their accounts .
Many users found that MySpace was removing the image with accompanying political words or phrases , citing it as “ offensive ” and grouping it in the same category as “ nude / sexually explicit / violence ” images .
Below is a screenshot of the email many users have sent to us :
In addition , other users also found that attempting to upload the image resulted in a similar message informing them the image “ violated terms of use ” :
[ efoods ]
In a further report , we also detailed how users discovered that uploading images of George W. Bush as The Joker is deemed to be acceptable by MySpace , while attempting to upload Obama as The Joker is classed as a violation .
Throughout our investigation we have attempted to contact MySpace for clarification .
Here is the question we asked :
Hello , I am a journalist with the website Infowars.com .
I have received several complaints from myspace users that you are removing images of president Obama as the Joker .
As you may know this image has been in the news recently because many people are using it as a form of political protest .
While it has been described as racist by some in the media , the original artist , a politically minded American Muslim , has said it was intended as a form of protest against the President ’s policies .
I would like to know if it is true that Myspace is removing this image from users ’ pages , and if so for what reason .
Earlier this week we received a standard response from the company that merely linked to their terms and conditions page .
The email we received read :
MySpace periodically updates both the MySpace Terms of Service and the MySpace Privacy Policy .
If MySpace makes a significant change to the Privacy Policy , MySpace will notify all Profile owners , however , we recommend that all MySpace Profile owners review these two important policies .
After pointing out that this did not answer our question and asking for further clarification , we have now received the following response :
MySpace only removes images or content that violate Terms of Use .
Please check TOS on Myspace .
Since there is no cyberbully , nudity , harrasment or imposter we do not remove any image or content .
While this may be badly worded and grammatically incorrect , it seems to suggest that the company is denying having removed the Jokerbama image and classifying it as a violation of TOS .
This denial is clearly contradicted by the evidence supplied to Infowars by numerous readers .
We have once more asked MySpace to explain the emails our readers have received and whether or not they will continue to remove the Jokerbama image from users ’ accounts .

The newly discovered miniature tyrannosaur pre-dates T - rex by millions of years but has almost identical features
Fossil hunters have unearthed the remains of a man-sized forerunner to the colossal Tyrannosaurus rex from an ancient lake bed in northeastern China .
The remarkable discovery has allowed dinosaur experts to piece together a picture of a diminutive but formidable predator that was so finely tuned to killing they describe it as " Jaws on legs " .
The beast , named Raptorex kriegsteini , roamed the Earth 130 m years ago , tens of millions of years before the giant T - rex became the most fearsome predator in history .
The finding has stunned palaeontologists because the skeleton resembles the larger tyrannosaurs in every respect except its size .
Measurements of bones recovered from the site reveal that the new species was one hundredth the size of T-rex .
Analyses of the remains by researchers at the University of Chicago and the American Museum of Natural History in New York revealed the dinosaur to be a juvenile of five or six years old , measuring nearly 3 m from nose to tail and weighing only 60kg ( nine stone ) .
A similar aged T - rex could weigh several tonnes .
Though smaller than its more celebrated descendant , Raptorex was the largest meat - eater of its time .
It would have enjoyed a varied diet of parrot - beaked psittacosaurs , turtles , primitive birds and a host of small , scampering dinosaurs that would have watered at the ancient lakes it lived near .
The exquisite and almost complete remains only came to light when an American eye surgeon , Henry Kriegstein , telephoned the researchers to say he had bought the fossil from a trader .
Paul Sereno at the University of Chicago agreed to document the fossil – and name it after the surgeon 's father – on condition that the remains were returned to China afterwards .
The Chicago team has spent the past three years preparing and studying the fossil , which was lodged in a block of sediment removed from the Lujiatun lake beds in northeast China .
Writing in the US journal Science , the researchers describe the delicate operation to clean and prepare the skeleton .
The skull was sent through an X - ray scanner at a Chicago hospital before moulds and casts of the bones were made .
The X - rays revealed enlarged brain regions that suggest the creature had a highly evolved sense of smell .
The discovery overturns scientists ' thinking about how Tyrannosaurus rex evolved .
Many of the most striking features of the beast , such as its puny forearms , were thought to be a trade - off during the evolution of its enormous size , but Raptorex shows these features had already evolved more than 60 m years earlier .
" So much of what we thought we knew about Tyrannosaur evolution turns out to be simplistic or out - and - out wrong , " said Stephen Brusatte , a member of the team .
" The thinking has been that as tyrannosaurs developed to a truly giant size , they needed to modify their entire skeleton so they could function as predators .
" Raptorex , the new species , really throws a wrench into this observed pattern .
Here we have an animal that 's one 90th or one 100th the size of T. Rex , but with all the signature features , the big head , the strong muscles and the tiny little arms .
" We can now say these features did n't evolve as a consequence of body size , but rather they just evolved as a set of efficient predatory weapons , " Brusatte added .
Raptorex had powerful legs to run down its prey and a huge muscular jaw with which to dispatch them .
" This is a blueprint for a predator : Jaws on legs , " Sereno said .
Researchers now believe that tyrannosaurs spent almost all of their time on Earth as small , flighty predators like Raptorex .
As other large dinosaurs became extinct , this left the path clear for Raptorex to expand in body size and ultimately become the giant Tyrannosaurus rex .
" When it did , there was no turning back until the asteroid hit , " said Brusatte .
Sereno said Kriegstein agreed to donate the fossil remains to science if the species was named in honour of his father , Roman .
" The specimen was found perhaps in the dark of night and spirited out of China and ultimately sold .
[ Mr Kriegman ] contacted me and wondered if I would describe it .
I said I would if it could be returned 100 % , lock , stock and barrel to science and ultimately back to China .
" I think he saw that there was a sense of immortality in having a dinosaur named after your family , " Sereno said .
Nur dieses eine Wort war es .

Wegen „ Korruptionsverdacht “ , behauptete die Zeitung , sei Harald Friedrich ( Grüne ) , der ehemalige Abteilungsleiter des niordrhein - westfälischen Umweltministeriums , gefeuert worden .
Der Beweis dazu fehlte .
Das merkte auch der Düsseldorfer Staatsanwalt Christoph K .
Er notierte tagsdrauf , „ dem vorliegenden Pressebericht sind zureichende tatsächliche Anhaltspunkte für ein Korruptionsdelikt nicht zu entnehmen “ .
Staatsanwalt K. legte die Akte weg .
Doch auch Beamte des Landeskriminalamtes ( LKA ) hatten den „ Bild “ - Bericht gesehen .
Und fragten am nächsten Tag im Umweltministerium nach .
Damit traten sie Ermittlungen los , die Friedrich später als Verbrecher darstellten und für ihn zu einer existenzbedrohenden Lawine wurden .
Angehäuft mit Märchen , Spekulationen , Behauptungen und riskanter Logik .
Eines der Märchen stammte aus dem von der CDU geführten Ministerium , das prompt Strafanzeige erstattete .
Wegen „ freihändiger Vergabe von Forschungsaufträgen “ durch Friedrich , den Vertrauten der Ex-Umweltministerin Bärbel Höhn ( Grüne ) .
Der habe , so schmückte speziell Ministerialrat Jörg - Michael G. in Dichterart aus , wissenschaftliche Forschungsaufträge im Wert von über 2 Millionen Euro „ unter Missachtung der einschlägigen Vergaberichtlinien “ erteilt .
Damit habe , heißt es in der Anzeige des Ministeriums , Friedrich „ geldwerte Vorteile in derzeit nicht bekanntem Umfang “ ergattert .
Im LKA wurde derlei zunächst skeptisch bewertet .
„ Es bedarf einer umfänglichen Sichtung , Verdichtung , und kriminalistischen Bewertung der Sachverhalte “ , heißt in einem Vermerk .
Doch dann folgte überwiegend die Verdichtung der Vorwürfe .
Während die Notiz vom 14 .
Juli 2006 noch mit dem Verdacht des Betruges und „ anderer Delikte “ überschrieben war , erweiterte derselbe LKA - Beamte ihn 10 Tage später auf Vorteilsannahme und Bestechlichkeit .
Begründung dazu ?
Keine .
Einfach so .
Stattdessen sichteten die Ermittler das leere Büro des geschassten Abteilungsleiters .
Und stellten vermeintlich bedeutsames Material sicher .
Das achtseitige Protokoll nennt etwa einen Bericht zur Umsetzung der Europäischen Wasserrahmenrichtlinie und ein Buch mit dem Titel „ Klärschlammentsorgung : Eine Bestandsaufnahme “ .
An der Inventur des Ministeriums arbeitete Ministerialrat G. tüchtig weiter .
In einer E - Mail trug er das Gerücht weiter , Friedrich habe womöglich eine Woche lang Urlaub in Frankreich gemacht .
Und dort ein Ehepaar getroffen , das einen Auftrag über 300 000 Euro bekommen hatte .
Von wem ?
Von Friedrich ?
Keine Fakten , nur Tratsch .
Der allerdings dazu führte , dass ein LKA - Beamter sich urplötzlich dafür interessierte , ob Friedrich Kunde oder Verkäufer beim Internethandel „ ebay “ war .
Das ging so : „ Hallo Christoph “ , schrieb der Kriminalbeamte an einen Bekannten im Wuppertaler Finanzamt für Steuerfahndung , „ wie besprochen bräuchte ich mal eine Auskunft “ .
Tags drauf bekam ebay hochoffizielle Post „ per Fax , Anfrage Eilt ! “ .
Das Amt führe „ Vorermittlungen “ gegen Friedrich .
Der habe , das sei bekannt , „ Umsätze bei ebay getätigt “ .
Eine durch nichts bewiesene Behauptung .
Die auch von ebay nicht bestätigt wurde .
Allerdings kostenpflichtig , zu Lasten der Steuerzahler .
Auf neue Ideen brachte Ministerialrat G. die LKA - Beamten .
Sie hatten durch Minsterialrat G. vom Gerücht erfahren , Friedrich strebe eine Professur an .
Als hätte er nun die Erleuchtung , bastelte ein Beamter daraus einen Straftatbestand .
Denn angenommen , Friedrich wäre zum Professor berufen worden , eventuell sogar an der Technischen Hochschule Aachen , die Fördergelder von ihm bekommen hatte – dann bedeutete das eine gesellschaftliche „ Prestige - und Ansehenssteigerung “ .
Die wiederum wäre die illegale Annahme eines Vorteils .
Die Krönung dieses Gedankengangs ist eine aus dem Umweltministerium getragene Tuschelei : „ Herr Friedrich lebte die Philosophie keine Leistung ohne Gegenleistung . “
So und ähnlich wurde weiter ermittelt .
Mit stets neuer Nahrung aus dem Ministerium ( Es gebe „ mögliche Auffälligkeiten “ , „ es war ungewöhnlich , dass … “ , Friedrich ging „ in einem sehr großen Ausmaß im Umfeld von Düsseldorf essen “ ) .
Und immer wieder wurde ein „ Anfangsverdacht “ gebastelt .
Auch deshalb hat die Staatsanwaltschaft Wuppertal , die wegen des Verdachts der organisierten Kriminalität eingeschaltet wurde , inzwischen die meisten Vorwürfe wegen Friedrichs erwiesener Unschuld sang - und klanglos eingestellt .
Meist mit den entlarvend dürren Worten „ Der Anfangsverdacht wurde nicht bestätigt “ .
Diesen vermeintlichen Anfangsverdacht übernahm vor einem Jahr jeweils die Wuppertaler Amtsrichterin Carmen S. und erließ weitreichende Beschlüsse : 270 Beamte durchsuchten bundesweit rund 30 Objekte , Friedrich ging für 3 Wochen in Untersuchungshaft , 9 Personen wurden 4 Wochen lang ohne ihr Wissen beobachtet , 2.500 Telefonate wurden abgehört , 2.000 E - Mails von den Fahndern heimlich gelesen .
Diese Aktion rief das Parlament auf den Plan .
In einem Untersuchungsausschuss wollen SPD und Grüne geklärt wissen , ob die Landesregierung die Ermittlungen irgendwie beeinflusst hat .
Die Staatsanwaltschaft will im kommenden Monat entscheiden , was vom Verfahren mit seinen über 11.000 Seiten überhaupt noch übrig bleibt .
Sehr zum Ärger der vorgesetzten Generalstaatsanwaltschaft in Düsseldorf .
Die murrt seit Monaten und meint , das gesamte Verfahren könne längst eingestellt worden sein .

A few weeks ago , I decided that I 'd like to focus for a while on getting a 1.0 release of the Haskell text library ready .
That work has gone fairly well so far .
I 've focused on making sure that I like the API , and that a few key functions have good performance characteristics .
One such function is substring search , which is the underpinning for a number of useful functions ( split a string on a delimiter , find all substrings , etc ) .
My initial cut at that function had an obvious API , but ran in O ( nm ) time , which complexity measure I found mildly embarrassing .
So I looked around for an alternative that would be faster , but still simple to implement , and settled upon Fredrik Lundh 's elegant and trim adaptation of Boyer - Moore - Sunday - Horspool , which has O ( n +m ) complexity in the typical case .
Using QuickCheck , I was quickly able to satisfy myself that my new code was correct , so now I was faced with demonstrating to myself that the code was fast , too .
I looked on Hackage for a good benchmarking package , but although there were several benchmarking packages available , they were all extremely simple , and I was n't happy with any of them .
I have sort of a mutt 's pedigree in computing , having spent several stints working in the high performance scientific computing world , so I felt antsy about measuring performance reliably .
Over the course of a few days of hacking , I came up with a good framework that I am currently finishing off .
One of the things a good benchmarking framework needs is some statistical heavy lifting , to do things like autocorrelation analysis , kernel density function estimation , and bootstrapping , so I had to write some complicated statistical code along the way .
I 've now packaged that code up and released it as the statistics library on Hackage .
Some of the features implemented in this first release of the statistics library include :
Support for common discrete and continuous probability distributions ( binomial , gamma , exponential , geometric , hypergeometric , normal , and Poisson )
Kernel density estimation
Autocorrelation analysis
Functions over sample data
Quantile estimation
Resampling techniques : jackknife and bootstrap estimation
The statistics library certainly is n't yet comprehensive , but it has some features that I think make it very attractive as a base for further work :
It 's very fast , building on some of the fantastic software that 's available on Hackage these days .
I make heavy use of Don Stewart 's uvector library ( itself a port of Roman Leshchinskiy 's vector library ) , which means that many functions allocate no memory and execute tight loops using only machine registers .
I use Dan Doel 's uvector - algorithms library to perform fast partial sorts .
I also use Don 's mersenne - random library for fast random number generation when doing bootstrap analysis .
I 've put a fair amount of effort into finding and using algorithms that are numerically stable ( trying to avoid problems like catastrophic cancellation ) .
Whenever possible , I indicate which methods are used in the documentation .
( For more information on numerical stability , see What Every Scientist Should Know About Floating - Point Arithmetic ) .
For me , one of the killer features of Haskell for statistical computation is its combination of terseness and fabulous libraries .
In particular , the modern collection libraries like uvector and text , which are built on stream fusion frameworks , provide a combination of expressiveness and high performance that is simply delightful to work with .
Speaking of improving the statistics library , I 've already received a few patches to the statistics library even before announcing it anywhere , and I 'm very much looking forward to receiving more .
If you want to contribute , go get the source code and hack away :
darcs get http://darcs.serpentine.com/statistics
So now that the statistics library is in good enough shape , I can return to work on the benchmarking framework .
Once that 's done , I 'll get back to finishing off the text library .
It 's been funny to see how rewriting 50 lines of code has spawned off weeks of enjoyable work on other projects !
I hope that people will find all of this work useful .
By the way , the philosophy underlying the text , statistics , and benchmarking libraries is uniform across the lot of them : build and release something thatâ€ ” even though initially incompleteâ€ ” is thorough enough and of such high quality that other people will be drawn to improving your work instead of creating half a dozen tiny alternatives .
So please , join in , and let the patches fly !
Snap , crackle , pop .
The world is alive with invisible magnetic field lines .
Take a length of wire with a current running through it ; it generates a magnetic field that curls around the wire , but we can't see it .
Magnetic Movie from Semiconductor on Vimeo .
Video artists Ruth Jarman and Joe Gerhardt , who work under the moniker Semiconductor , shot footage of empty lab space at UC Berkeley 's Space Science Laboratory .
Then they brought the inanimate objects to life , painting in the vivacious spaghetti of magnetic field lines coming off the unassuming electronics .
The pair , who hail from London , spent four months " researching and experimenting " at the northern California lab , which tackles a smorgasbord of space physics topics , from the search for extra terrestrial intelligence to solar flares .
One might say that the scientists were " researching and experimenting , " and that the artists were watching .
Or one might say that Semiconductor 's appropriation of raw satellite data of coronal mass ejections was a form of data processing , and that when they videotaped the lab 's scientists trying to answer one very tough question , they were trying to prod the borders of science 's domain .
I should warn that Semiconductor 's magnetic field lines , while certainly beautiful ( especially with all the added space - noises ! ) are not what the field lines of these objects actually look like .
( The scene with the wires is the biggest give - away . )
But I think the artists skillfully evoke this invisible force , even if they 're not portraying it in a way true to nature .
Think impressionism rather than realism .
I found the inaccuracy a little disappointing until I found SSL 's website for IMPACT , a suite of instruments that collect data about solar wind electrons and the sun 's fluctuating magnetic field .
IMPACT is part of STEREO , two space craft , one in front of the earth and one behind , that monitor the sun 's storms .
If you watch the videos on the STEREO site ( the introduction is a good one ) , it seems like Semiconductor were drawing their inspiration from the " hairball " of magnetic field lines on the sun , and the violence of coronal mass ejections , hot balls of plasma the sun fires toward earth on occasion .
Another fun resource are these animated models on the IMPACT page , which raises the question again - Who are the artists here and who are the scientists ?
Semiconductor 's animations are inspired by some really interesting science , but would n't it be cool to see what magnetic field lines actually look like ?
Check out Falstad.com , the Disneyland of physics computer applets , which has a great little widget that allows you to see the magnetic fields and vector lines of some common configurations like a current - carrying wire , a loop of current , or an electromagnet .
You can move your wire around , change the strength of the field , or sprinkle the air with tiny current carrying loops and see what happens .
Just make sure to read the directions !

When Miles unpacks the lunch that Uncle Buck has made for him and asks the boy to his right " Would you like to talk about a possible lunch trade ? " ( 27:51 to 28:10 ) , the scene cuts to an overhead shot ( 28:11 to 28:12 ) of the three boys at his table propelling their chairs backwards across the room .
The overhead cut has numerous continuity errors .
At 28:11 , (1 ) Miles is still unpacking his lunch so his hand is back in the lunch bag and he is missing the canned sardines and two plastic bags , ( 2 ) the boy to Miles ' right is wearing a solid purple shirt rather than a blue shirt with black stripes , and ( 3 ) the sandwich in the right hand of the boy to Miles ' right has been replaced with a bag of Fritos .

FOX News has been trying to paint Code Pink as a group that goes out and attacks politicians when they protest .
That 's a big , fat lie .
I guess their blinding pink t- shirts causes retinal damage to conservative eye balls .
However , Rep. Gerry Connolly has some disturbing news , but not surprising .
As lobbyist - run groups encourage conservative activists to “ rattle ” members of Congress at local town hall events , Rep. Gerry Connolly ( D - VA ) , the president of the freshman Democratic class has revealed that “ at least one freshman Democrat ” has already been “ physically assaulted at a local event . ”
Connolly warned that conservative groups had taken things to a “ dangerous level “ : “ When you look at the fervor of some of these people who are all being whipped up by the right - wing talking heads on Fox , to me , you ’re crossing a line , ’ Connolly said .
‘ They ’re inciting people to riot with just total distortions of facts .
They think we ’re going to euthanize Grandma and the government is going to take over . ”
Nancy Pelosi is the next target by the Malkinites and that could get really ugly .
Frank Kratovil was hung in effigy .
Chris Dodd was told to go kill himself .
Gerry Connolly says that one Freshman was assaulted , and Brad Miller got death threats .
Nancy Pelosi is showing up to support Diane DeGette and Jared Polis at an event in Denver tomorrow , and the Malkinites are going to be out in force .
If you 're in Denver , please show up and support Democrats against the thuggery of the insurance industry - funded GOP astroturfers

It may sound like science fiction , but freakish galactic events such as ravenous black holes and ripples in the space - time continuum could be happening all around us .
according to new research from Swinburne University of Technology .
In a study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , Swinburne researchers examined 50 regular galaxies to determine their composition and structure .
The researchers , Associate Professor Alister Graham and Dr Lee Spitler , found that 12 of these galaxies contained a double nucleus -- that is , they had both a super massive black hole and a dense star cluster containing up to ten million stars at their centre .
Traditionally astronomers believed that most small galaxies had a compact star cluster at their centre while giant galaxies had a super massive black hole .
Double nucleus galaxies were thought to be extremely rare ; however the Swinburne researchers have shown that they are actually quite common .
According to Graham , the prevalence of double nucleus galaxies significantly increases the likelihood of several bizarre astronomical phenomena occurring .
advertisement
The first of these is a phenomenon where black holes ‘ eat up ’ nearby stars .
“ When stars get too close to massive black holes , the gravitational attraction is such that they can be devoured , ” Graham said .
“ When you ’ve got up to a million stars within the immediate vicinity of a black hole , the chance of this occurring increases significantly . ”
The predominance of double nucleus galaxies also means there are likely to be many more ‘ hyper velocity stars ’ in existence than astronomers had thought .
“ This is when a star approaches a massive black hole and gets caught in a gravitational slingshot .
When this happens stars can be ejected from galaxies at speeds in excess of 500 kilometres per second , ” Graham said .
Another implication of the research – and according to the researchers one of the most exciting – is the increased likelihood of the phenomenon known as gravitational radiation .
advertisement
“ Such emission has been predicted by Einstein ’s General Theory of Relativity , but has never been observed , ” said Spitler .
“ It is theorised that when stars spiral quickly around a black hole the motion will create gravitational waves – causing ripples in the space - time continuum . ”
The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna ( LISA ) – a suite of three satellites spaced five million kilometres apart and planned for launch in 2018 – is being designed to search for such ripples as they pass through our solar system .
While the Swinburne research has greatly increased the chance of observing some of the more bizarre events in our Universe , it also has some immediate consequences for astronomers .
“ As part of our study we were able to look at star clusters and black holes and determine their mass in proportion to each other and their host galaxies , ” Graham said .
“ This knowledge is going to affect the way astronomers develop models for galaxy formation and evolution .
“ Previously evolution models only dealt with one type of nucleus per galaxy .
We now have the rationale and data to develop hybrid models that can account for co-existing nuclei and hopefully explore their dynamic joint evolution . ”

Much of the chemical waste still remains in Abidjan BBC Newsnight has uncovered evidence revealing that oil - trading company Trafigura knew that waste dumped in Ivory Coast in 2006 was hazardous .
Trafigura had persistently denied that the waste was harmful but internal e-mails show staff knew it was hazardous .
On Wednesday , Newsnight learned that Trafigura has offered to pay damages to settle a class action brought on behalf of 31,000 who said they were injured .
Up until now Trafigura has refused to settle , denying it was to blame .
The news of the settlement came as a UN report on claims that people had fallen sick or died as a result of the dump was published .

The report says there is " strong prima facie evidence that the reported deaths and adverse health consequences are related to the dumping of the waste from the cargo ship " .
The chemical waste came from a ship called Probo Koala and in August 2006 truckload after truckload of it was illegally fly - tipped at 15 locations around Abidjan , the biggest city in Ivory Coast .
In the weeks that followed the dumping , tens of thousands of people reported a range of similar symptoms , including breathing problems , sickness and diarrhoea .
Refinery by - product
The story began four years ago at an oil refinery in Mexico , owned by the state company Pemex , or PMI .
This is as cheap as anyone can imagine and should make serious dollars
Trafigura e-mail
Read Trafigura 's response
In its chemical processes the refinery was producing a by - product - coker naptha , a dirty form of gasoline which could not be treated on site .
The e-mails which Newsnight has obtained reveal that Trafigura executives realised they could make a fortune by buying the dirty Mexican oil for next to nothing .
One e-mail says : " This is as cheap as anyone can imagine and should make serious dollars . "
However , to sell it on at a profit , Trafigura first had to find a cheap way to clean the coker naptha and lower its sulphur levels .
Difficulties Trafigura chartered the Probo Koala and while the ship was off the coast of Gibraltar poured tons of caustic soda and a catalyst into the dirty oil to clean it - a rough and ready process known as " caustic washing " .
The method is cheap , but it generates such dangerous waste that it is effectively banned in most places around the world .
The e-mails obtained by Newsnight show that in the months before the waste was dumped the company knew about the difficulties they would face in disposing of the waste .
" This operation is no longer allowed in the European Union , the United States and Singapore " it is " banned in most countries due to the ' hazardous nature of the waste ' " , one e-mail warns .
Another e-mail points out that " environmental agencies do not allow disposal of the toxic caustic " .
The process left a toxic sulphurous sludge in the tanks of the Probo Koala .
Costly process
Claiming that the waste was simply tank washings - the standard oil - water mixture produced by routine tank cleaning - Trafigura attempted to offload the waste in the Netherlands .
However , when the waste was offloaded the smell was so strong , the emergency services were called .
Samples were taken and Trafigura was told the waste was toxic and would cost hundreds of thousands of euros to treat safely .
However , Trafigura opted for the much cheaper option of reloading the waste and taking it elsewhere .
It ultimately ended up in Ivory Coast .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Evidence seen by Newsnight shows that knowledge of the waste and problems getting rid of it went to the very top of Trafigura and the company 's President Claude Dauphin .
The Trafigura e-mails say that Mr Dauphin was urging his team to " be creative " in how they dealt with the hazardous waste .
The contractor that they found in the end was Solomon Ugburogbu , the owner of a company called Tommy , which had no facilities to handle hazardous waste .
Ugburogbu , is now serving a 20 year sentence for poisoning local people .
Offer Trafigura has always denied and continues to deny any liability for events that occurred in Ivory Coast .
In a statement to Newsnight on Wednesday the company said : " With regard to Trafigura 's proposals for handling the treatment and disposal of the slops , Trafigura always sought to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it operates . "
In 2007 they paid £ 100 m to the Ivorian government to " compensate the victims " amongst other things .
The government administered fund paid compensation to the families of 16 people whose deaths they believed were caused by the waste .
On Wednesday Trafigura admitted a " global settlement is being considered " for the victims who suffered lesser injuries .
A statement from the Ivorians ' lawyers , Leigh Day and Company , confirms an offer has been made and says : " The claimants are very pleased and are keen to see the issue resolved . "
Watch Newsnight 's full report on Trafigura on Wednesday 16 September 2009 at 10.30 pm on BBC Two , then afterwards on the BBC iPlayer and Newsnight website .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Charges have been dropped against four men accused of raping an 18 - year - old student at Hofstra University after the woman recanted her allegations , prosecutors said .
A Hofstra University student recanted her claims that she was lured to a dorm and assaulted in a bathroom stall .
A judge dismissed all charges Wednesday night and ordered the release of the four men -- Jesus Ortiz , 19 ; Stalin Felipe , 19 ; Kevin Taveras , 20 ; and Rondell Bedward , 21 ; all of the New York metropolitan area , according to Nassau County , New York , District Attorney Kathleen Rice .
They had been arrested , arraigned and jailed , with bail set at $ 500,000 each .
Each was facing five counts of first - degree rape .
" Late this evening , during the continuation of the Nassau County Police Department 's investigation of the allegation , and under questioning by my office 's chief trial attorney and chief sex crimes prosecutor , the alleged victim of the sexual assault admitted that the encounter that took place early Sunday morning was consensual , " Rice said .
She said her office has launched a criminal investigation into the statements and reports given by the woman .
The student had told Nassau County police that she had been lured from a club , forced into a men's bathroom at a university dormitory , bound and assaulted .
The woman then called the university public safety office , which alerted local police .
The reported rape shocked the Hofstra University community .
The university had announced that it was increasing safety patrols on campus , as well as establishing a support hotline for students and parents .

There are many celebrating the recovery as if it were already here .�
This is a brief post to outline my main remaining concerns for recovery of the global economy .
1 ) � China is overstimulating its economy , and forcing its banks to make bad loans . �
This pushes up commodity prices , and makes it look like China is growing , but little of the investments made are truly needed by the rest of the global economy .
2 ) � Western European banks have lent too much to Eastern European nations in Euros . �
The Eastern Europeans can’t afford it , and widespread defaults are a possibility .
3 ) �
The average maturity of bonds held by foreign investors in US Treasuries is falling .�
Runs on currencies happen when countries can no longer roll over their debts easily , which is facilitated by having a lot of debt to refinance at once .
4 ) �
On a mark - to - market basis , market values for commercial real estate have fallen dramatically . �
Neither REIT stocks nor carrying values for loans on the books of banks reflect this yet .�
Many banks are insolvent at market - clearing prices for commercial real estate .
5 ) � We still have yet to feel the effects from pay - option ARMs resetting and recasting .�
Most of the pain in residential housing is done , but on the high end , there is still more pain to come , and the pay - option ARMs will reinforce that .
6 ) � The rally in corporate debt and loans was too early and fast .�
Conditions are not back to normal for creditworthiness .�
There should be a pullback in corporate credit .
7 ) � We had global overbuilding is cyclical sectors 2002 - 2007 .�
We overshot the demand for large boats as an example .�
We overdeveloped energy supplies ( that will be short - lived ) , metals , and other commodities . �
It will take a while to grow into the extra capacity .
8 ) �
The US consumer is still over - levered .�
It will be a while before he can resume his profligate ways , assuming a new frugality does not overcome the US . �
( Not likely by historical standards . )
9 ) �
The Federal Reserve will have a hard time removing their nonstandard policy accommodation .
10 ) �
We still have the pensions / retiree healthcare crisis in front of us globally .
That ’s all .�
To my readers , if you can think of large unsolved problems in the global economy , forward them on to me here in the comments . �
If I agree , I will incorporate them in future articles .

Inside the fake ' Big Brother ' house where nine women were tricked into believing they were on a reality TV show for two months
This is the Istanbul villa where nine women were rescued by Turkish military police after being tricked into believing they were reality TV show contestants .
On Monday police stormed the villa in Riva , a summer resort on the outskirts of Istanbul .
A police spokesman said the women were held captive for around two months but refused to provide further details .
Fake show :
The villa where nine captive women were rescued by Turkish military police in Istanbul
Fooled :
The nine women , whose naked images were reportedly sold over the internet
The women were apparently made to believe they were being filmed for a Big Brother - type television show , according to the private Dogan news agency .
Instead , their naked images were sold on the Internet , reports said .
The women had responded to an advert searching for contestants for a reality show that would be aired on a major Turkish television station , Dogan said .
The nine , including a teenager , were selected among several applicants following an interview , it said .
A bedroom inside the villa where nine captive women were rescued by Turkish military police in Istanbul
They were made to sign a contract that stipulated that they could have no contact with their families or the outside world and would have to pay a 50,000 Turkish Lira fine ( £ 23,000 ) if they left the show before two months , the agency reported .
The women are said to have soon realized they were being duped and asked to leave the villa but told they could not leave unless they paid the fine and those who insisted were threatened .
There were conflicting reports as to how the raid occurred .
The Dogan agency said police stormed the villa after some family members complained to police that they were being prevented from contacting the women .
The women cried for help when the military police arrived at the villa , it said .
HaberTurk newspaper said one of the women managed to contact a family member and asked for help .
The paper did not give a source for the report .
There were also conflicting reports concerning the age of the teenager , thought to have been in the house .
Mock - up : A gazebo outside the villa - apparently the women were threatened when they asked to leave after realising they were being duped
Dogan said she was 16 while HaberTurk newspaper gave her age as 15 .
HaberTurk said the girls were models from in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya and the Aegean port city of Izmir .
' We were not after the money but we thought our daughter could have the chance of becoming famous if she took part in the contest .
' But they have duped us all , ' the newspaper quoted one of the women 's mothers as saying identifying her only by her first name , Remziye .
She said the women were not abused or harassed sexually .
They were told however , to fight each other , to wear bikinis and dance by villa 's pool , the paper quoted the mother as saying .
Duped : Another bedroom inside the villa where the nine women lived for around two months
HaberTurk said police detained four people who lived with the women at the villa at all times .
They were released from custody pending the outcome of a trial , the report said .
Their identities were not released and it was not know what the charges were .
It is not unusual for Turkish courts to release suspects from custody if the charges brought do n't carry long prison sentences , and the suspects are not likely to escape or tamper with evidence .
HaberTurk said police were still looking for the gang 's leader who sold images of the women on the internet .
Police refused to comment on the suspects or the charges brought .
The ' Big Brother ' TV show , which is called ' Someone is Watching Us ' in Turkish , confines a group of people to a house under the constant gaze of cameras .

Introduction by Alex
For Marxists , this article should n’t tell us anything we do n’t already know , but for the rest of the population , it is a great summation of capitalism and it very briefly touches on the Marxist alternative .
Although it does not have a wealth of information , it serves as a very straightforward summary of Marx ’s Das Kapital , and it comes from one of the greatest minds in the history of mankind .
Since this is Einstein talking , I believe it is a good “ first step ” into the vast world of Marxist thought because it is short , sweet , and to the point , and his name , unlike the name of Marx , has not yet been tarnished by the ruling class .
[ There was an attempt by the FBI , during the Hoover administration , to show that Einstein was a Soviet spy , but this failed and the investigation was swept under the carpet . ]
Einstein mentions that the solution to all of capitalism ’s problems is an economy that is run in a planned way .
He does , however , make this distinction :
“ Nevertheless , it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism .
A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual .
The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems : how is it possible , in view of the far - reaching centralization of political and economic power , to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all - powerful and overweening ?
How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured ? ”
He does not answer that question and I think it is something that needs to be addressed now .
Central planning is a tool that the workers may use , and indeed , in moderation , central planning may be very useful .
But we have to understand that this is not our goal , and it is not and cannot be the only tool that we will use .
Central planning on a massive scale where every last little thing is micromanaged is extremely inefficient , and that is what led to the collapse of the Soviet Union .
It is also extremely vulnerable to corruption without , as Einstein puts it , “ a democratic counterweight . ”
So what , then , is our answer to Einstein ’s question ?
It is that :
a ) Central planning is not our goal and it is not the only tool that the workers will use .
Our goal is a society where everyone runs the economy in common without money , wages , or exchange of any kind , with the necessary precursor of workers ’ rule .
b) Under workers ’ rule , the entire working class will have concrete democratic rights of free speech and the freedom to organize independently of the “ Marxist ” party without permission from the state .
In this way , any corruption or hypocrisy that develops can and will be exposed / dealt with .
Because I do n’t want to waste any more of your time , I will only post the second half of the article , as the first half is n’t really relevant .
However , you can find the whole article here : [ link ]
Albert Einstein : Why Socialism ?
[…]
The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is , in my opinion , the real source of the evil .
We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor — not by force , but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules .
In this respect , it is important to realize that the means of production — that is to say , the entire productive capacity that is needed for producing consumer goods as well as additional capital goods — may legally be , and for the most part are , the private property of individuals .
For the sake of simplicity , in the discussion that follows I shall call “ workers ” all those who do not share in the ownership of the means of production — although this does not quite correspond to the customary use of the term .
The owner of the means of production is in a position to purchase the labor power of the worker .
By using the means of production , the worker produces new goods which become the property of the capitalist .
The essential point about this process is the relation between what the worker produces and what he is paid , both measured in terms of real value .
In so far as the labor contract is “ free , ” what the worker receives is determined not by the real value of the goods he produces , but by his minimum needs and by the capitalists ’ requirements for labor power in relation to the number of workers competing for jobs .
It is important to understand that even in theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product .
Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands , partly because of competition among the capitalists , and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of the smaller ones .
The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society .
This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties , largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who , for all practical purposes , separate the electorate from the legislature .
The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population .
Moreover , under existing conditions , private capitalists inevitably control , directly or indirectly , the main sources of information ( press , radio , education ) .
It is thus extremely difficult , and indeed in most cases quite impossible , for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights .
The situation prevailing in an economy based on the private ownership of capital is thus characterized main principles : first , means of production ( capital ) are privately owned and the owners dispose of them as they see fit ; second , the labor contract is free .
Of course , there is no such thing as a pure capitalist society in this sense .
In particular , it should be noted that the workers , through long and bitter political struggles , have succeeded in securing a somewhat improved form of the “ free labor contract ” for certain categories of workers .
But taken as a whole , the present - day economy does not differ much from “ pure ” capitalism .
Production is carried on for profit , not for use .
There is no provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find employment ; an “ army of unemployed ” almost always exists .
The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job .
Since unemployed and poorly paid workers do not provide a profitable market , the production of consumers ’ goods is restricted , and great hardship is the consequence .
Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all .
The profit motive , in conjunction with competition among capitalists , is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions .
Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor , and to that crippling of the social consciousness of individuals which I mentioned before .
This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism .
Our whole educational system suffers from this evil .
An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student , who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career .
I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils , namely through the establishment of a socialist economy , accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals .
In such an economy , the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion .
A planned economy , which adjusts production to the needs of the community , would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man , woman , and child .
The education of the individual , in addition to promoting his own innate abilities , would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow - men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society .
Nevertheless , it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism .
A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual .
The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems : how is it possible , in view of the far - reaching centralization of political and economic power , to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all - powerful and overweening ?
How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured ?
Things you could learn to get away with if only you were rich .
A cursory glance at TMZ today had us chaffing at the image of rap pop star Snoop Dogg standing in the rain watching what one can conclude is a game of football while a sharply dressed sentry was standing over him with an oversized umbrella , you know , just to keep the rain off Snoop and maybe so Snoop did n’t have to bother holding an umbrella .
In light of that image we thought we would come up with some more ‘ fun ’ ways for you to idly spend your money once or if you ever make it big .
First idle way of spending money would be paying someone to wake up every morning before you do and buy you coffee , cigarettes and even walk your dog .
Most people call these people their spouses now you can call them your ‘ associate helper . ”
Second idle way for you to spend money would be to have someone answer all your email , file them and politely answer them as if they were you .
Yes , of course in normal circumstances , these people would be called your secretary , but now they are called your “ correspondence associate . ”
Third idle way for you to spend money would be to pay people to just come and hang out with you like normal friends do , but here ’s the caveat , instead of having to be thoughtful and considerate , you can be as inconsiderate , disagreeable as you please without fear of retribution as you now have your “ associate house guests . ”
Finally for those of you who are really loaded and do n’t mind spending money can we recommend someone the “ surrogate associate , ” for a large sum of money you can pay these people vast sums of money to live your life while you spend all day hammered , sleeping in , watching TV all day or even football in the rain .

A crustacean that has fangs connected to secretory glands , from the stygofauna at Cape Range , Western Australia .
This is a very primitive group of crustaceans , previously only known from the northern hemisphere .
It is is one of 850 new species underground in the Australian Outback .
Down under in Australia , down underground , scientists have found 850 previously unknown species living in subterranean water , caves and micro-caverns .
These insects , crustaceans , spiders and worms are likely only about one - fifth of the number of undiscovered species the researchers think exist underground amid the harsh conditions of the Australian outback .
Two species of blind fish and two of blind eels were also uncovered .
" What we 've found is that you do n't have to go searching in the depths of the ocean to discover new species of invertebrate animals — you just have to look in your own backyard , " said researcher Andy Austin , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia .
[ Scientists say only a fraction of the species of plants and animals on the planet have been discovered . ]
Only half of the species discovered have so far been named , the scientists announced today .
Generically , the animals found in underground water are known as " stygofauna " and those from caves and micro-caverns are known as " troglofauna . "
When it came to the water - dwelling stygofauna , small crustaceans dominated at about three - quarters percent of all species , then insects , all beetles , at roughly one - sixth , with other kinds of creatures making up the rest .
For the cave - dwelling troglofauna , arachnids dominated at about one - half of all species , with insects at about one - quarter and crustaceans and others finishing the list .
" Virtually all are blind and completely lack eyes , and lack pigment , so they are pale or white in color , " Austin told LiveScience .
Often the species are quite delicate , he added , " and the insects in caves often have long legs and antennae — most sense vibration and use chemical senses , as they can not see in the pitch black . "
The scientists found these species during a comprehensive four - year survey of underground water and caves across arid and semi-arid Australia .
Austin and his colleagues suggest these species hid underground long ago due to past climate change .
" Central and southern Australia was a much wetter place 15 million years ago when there was a flourishing diversity of invertebrate fauna living on the surface , " Austin explained .
" But the continent became drier , a process that last until about 1 to 2 million years ago , resulting in our current arid environment .
Species took refuge in isolated favorable habitats , such as in underground waters and micro-caverns , where they survived and evolved in isolation from each other . "
So far the surveys have examined only 10 percent of the areas that likely have stygo - and troglofauna , Austin said .
They now want to drastically expand their geographical coverage , as well as perform more genetic work to dissect when these creatures diverged from their brethren and see how this matches up with climate change and other geological events .
Although this new discovery is exciting scientifically , it also poses a number of challenges for the conservation of these species , as many of them are located in very remote areas of Australia , where there is significant ranching and mining that could potentially impact their survival .
" This said , it has been environmental monitoring by and support from mining companies that has helped with these discoveries , " Austin noted .
The scientists detailed its findings at a scientific conference on evolution and biodiversity in Darwin , Australia , which celebrated the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin and finished Sept. 28 .
The pharmaceutical industry has developed thousands of medicines that have saved millions of lives , but it has also used its marketing muscle to successfully peddle expensive pills that are no more effective than older drugs sold at a fraction of the cost .
No drug better demonstrates the industry ’s salesmanship than Lexapro , an antidepressant sold by Forest Laboratories .
And a document quietly made public recently by the Senate ’s Special Committee on Aging demonstrates just how Forest managed to turn a medicinal afterthought into a best seller .
The document , “ Lexapro Fiscal 2004 Marketing Plan , ” is an outline of the many steps Forest used to make Lexapro a success .
Because of concerns from Forest , the Senate committee released only 88 pages of the document , which may have originally run longer than 270 pages .
“ Confidential ” is stamped on every page .
But those 88 pages make clear that one of the principal means by which Forest hoped to persuade psychiatrists , primary care doctors and other medical specialists to prescribe Lexapro was by finding many ways to put money into doctors ’ pockets and food into their mouths .
MONTREAL – A Montreal woman killed by a slab of concrete as she was about to eat a belated birthday dinner was remembered warmly yesterday for her smile as well as a burning desire to advance her career .
To celebrate her 33rd birthday , Lea Guilbeault and her husband , Hani Beitinjaneh , went to a sushi restaurant on the ground floor of a highrise building in downtown Montreal on Thursday evening .
But a concrete slab weighing approximately 270 kilograms came crashing down 17 storeys , smashing through the atrium window of the Mikasa Sushi Bar .
" We do n't have the words to describe what we 're feeling , " said Suzanne Carrier , a colleague of Guilbeault 's at a financial institution , as she fought back tears .
" She was always smiling , she was very appreciated by her colleagues .
" She was ambitious , she had a bachelor of commerce from Concordia University and was continuing her courses to become a certified financial planner . "
As friends and relatives tried to come to grips with the tragedy , the Quebec agency that enforces building safety tried to determine what caused the concrete to snap free from its metal anchors .
Christine Grant of the Régie du bâtiment said no complaints had been filed about the 42 - year - old building , which houses the downtown Marriott Residence Inn .
Grant said it was too early to tell what happened and that a thorough investigation was necessary .
Files show the last inspection of the building occurred in March 2000 , the agency said .
That is far too long , according to Adel Hanna , an engineering professor at Concordia University .
" I would say a building over 30 years old should be inspected ... say , every second year , " Hanna said .
Deputy fire chief Ronald Dubeau told reporters there were initial signs of corrosion in the area , while an engineer at the scene remarked that other panels might be loose .
Beitinjaneh was treated for severe shock as well as injuries to a hand .
Montreal police reported he may have lost some fingers .

* Senate panel rejects amendment on public option
* Panel opens second week of debate on healthcare reform
* Other healthcare bills in Congress include public option
WASHINGTON , Sept 29 ( Reuters ) - A U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday rejected a government - run “ public ” insurance option as part of a broad healthcare overhaul , setting up a fight over one of the bill ’s most contentious issues .
The two votes in the Senate Finance Committee were the first of several battles expected in Congress over a public insurance option , a flashpoint in the raging U.S. debate over President Barack Obama ’s top domestic priority .
Democratic Chairman Max Baucus opposed both amendments , and said Democrats could not muster the 60 Senate votes needed to clear Republican procedural hurdles and pass a healthcare reform bill if it includes the public option .
“ I can count , ” Baucus said .
“ No one has been able to show me how they can count up to 60 votes with a public option in the bill . ”
Supporters of the option disagreed and said they expected more success when the issue is taken up in the full Senate and the House of Representatives , where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has vowed the public option will be included in a final bill .
“ The more the American people hear about the public option , the more they like it , ” said Democratic Senator Charles Schumer , who sponsored one of the amendments .
The Senate Finance plan by Baucus is the only healthcare reform bill pending in Congress that does not have a public insurance plan , which Obama and other backers say would boost competition for insurers .
Republican critics say the public option would devastate the private insurance industry and ultimately lead to a government takeover of the sector .
Democratic Senator John Rockefeller , who offered the other amendment to insert a public option , said the approach would give the public more choices and force the insurance industry to compete .
“ Who comes first , the insurance companies or the American people ? ” he asked .
Senator Charles Grassley , the senior Republican on the panel , said the public option would represent a first step toward the eventual goal of Democrats -- a complete government - run health insurance system .
‘ DRIVE INSURERS OUT OF BUSINESS ’
“ A government - run plan will ultimately drive private insurers out of business , ” Grassley said .
“ If you support government bureaucrats , not doctors , making decisions , you should support this amendment . ”
Five Democrats joined panel Republicans to oppose Rockefeller ’s amendment , 15 - 8 .
The second amendment , by Schumer , failed 13 - 10 with three Democrats opposed .
The votes came as the panel opened its second week of debate on a broad overhaul of the $ 2.5 trillion healthcare system .
The panel hopes to finish debate this week , with a final vote by at least early next week that will send it to the full Senate .
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid will merge the Finance panel ’s bill with one passed by the Senate Health committee before the full Senate takes up healthcare reform in the next few weeks .
The $ 900 billion Baucus bill , one of five pending in Congress , is designed to control costs , regulate insurers and expand coverage to more of the 46 million uninsured people living in the United States .
The plan under consideration by the Senate Finance panel would create state - based exchanges where individuals and small businesses could shop for insurance , but would not offer a government - run plan as an option .
As an alternative , the committee ’s bill would create nonprofit insurance cooperatives to create competition .
Rockefeller and other public option backers say cooperatives are unproven and would not offer enough competition .
Democratic Senator Kent Conrad , the prime proponent of cooperatives , said there were plenty of innovative models using non-profit approaches that have been tried around the world .
“ We ’ve gotten locked in a really sterile debate that says the only alternatives are what we ’ve got now or a public option , ” Conrad said .
Rockefeller ’s amendment would have tied reimbursement rates for healthcare providers to the lower rates under Medicare , the health insurance plan for the elderly , for two years .
If that happens , Conrad , who is from North Dakota , said , “ every major hospital in my state goes broke . ”
Rockefeller and Schumer said they had expected the issue to lose in the more conservative Senate panel but wanted to kick off debate .
Republicans were skeptical .
“ If it ’s so popular , why are there so many Democrats who have a problem with it ? ” Republican Senator John Ensign asked of the public option .

In the article below we said that a piranha had been found in the river Torridge in Devon .
The Environment Agency , which put out the story and photo , subsequently said it had misidentified what was , in fact , a different South American fish , the pacu .
A giant piranha – the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world – has been found in a Devon river , the Environment Agency said today .
Bathers in the UK 's rivers and streams should be reassured that the fish was dead and is thought to have been an abandoned pet .
Its discovery will add , however , to experts ' anxieties about non-native wildlife being introduced to the UK .
The fish , of a species more accustomed to the Amazon river basin , was discovered in the river Torridge by Environment Agency workers conducting a wildlife survey .
Eddie Stevens , one of the three - man monitoring team , said they were left open - mouthed by their discovery .
" What we actually came across was something which we would not expect to find in our wildest dreams .
We could hardly believe our eyes , " he said .
Used to more temperate climes , the fish probably could not tolerate the cold waters , the agency said .
A closer examination revealed that its stomach was full of sweetcorn – further evidence it may have been kept as a domestic pet .
At a length of 36 cm ( 14in ) , the red - bellied piranha was a giant of its kind – more than eight inches longer than an average specimen .
The team first spotted its tail sticking out of an undercut bank on the far side of the river .
" Our first thought was that a sea trout had become lodged in amongst the rocks and debris collected under the bank , " Stevens said .
" But when it was removed from the river we were speechless to find it was a piranha . "
The introduction of non-native species poses a serious threat to native wildlife , according to the agency .
Mark Diamond , an ecology manager , said : " Whilst piranhas can't survive the colder climates of the UK , this latest find highlights a real issue – that releasing unwanted exotic pets or plants into rivers can have serious consequences for native wildlife .
" Rather than dumping things in the wild , we would urge people to seek advice about what to do with exotic species . "
The first thing Jeffrey Mayer noticed when he began investigating the death of 15 - month - old Ava Worthington was a large discolored growth , " approximately the size of a baseball , " on the right side of her neck .
The child also appeared to be malnourished , with her ribs protruding , said Mayer , Clackamas County deputy medical examiner .
Mayer was the first witness in the trial of the girl 's parents , Raylene and Carl Brent Worthington .
The couple , members of an Oregon City church that practices faith healing , are charged with second - degree manslaughter and criminal neglect for failing to provide adequate medical care to the child .
Prosecutors displayed a photo for jurors that showed a swollen area from the girl 's ear to her collar bone .
" I had never seen anything like that , " said Mayer , who has investigated more than 1,000 deaths .
Prosecutors claim the growth interfered with Ava 's ability to breathe .
She died of bronchial pneumonia and a blood infection .
Defense attorneys said the growth was unsightly but had nothing to do with the death .
The say she died of the blood infection without showing symptoms of a fatal illness .
Mayer was the first investigator at the Worthington home on March 2 , 2008 , the night Ava died .
He spoke with the Worthingtons a few hours after their daughter died , and prosecutors on Tuesday played tapes of the interviews for jurors .
Raylene Worthington , at times barely audible , said her daughter had developed a cough a few days before she died .
The cough got worse and as Ava 's condition changed , church members were called to pray for the child , who died on a Sunday evening .
Brent Worthington said the girl 's breathing got worse Saturday night and that she slept fitfully .
Both parents noted that the swelling on Ava 's neck started increasing in size about 36 hours before she died about 7 p.m. Sunday .
There were as many as 200 members of the Followers of Christ church at the home when he arrived .
" It was standing room only , " Mayer said .
Mayer , who has investigated other deaths of church members , said it 's not uncommon for large numbers to be present when one of the congregation is seriously ill or dies .

“ Run your shower for a minute or so before you get in , otherwise you ’ll get a face full of bacteria . ”
That ’s the advice of microbiologist Norman Pace , who has had the unenviable task of analysing the film of microbes that builds up within shower heads at 45 sites in the US .
Pace and his team from the University of Colorado , Boulder , found significant loads of nontuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM ) , particularly Mycobacterium avium , at levels 100 times as high as those found in drinking water .
M. avium is responsible for a type of pulmonary disease more prevalent than TB in developed countries , cases of which have risen in parallel with the rise in showering , says Pace .
“ For most people , taking a shower is not dangerous , but if you are immune compromised , such as the elderly or pregnant , it could be , ” he says .
His advice is to not use shower heads made of plastic .
“ If it has little crusty deposits , throw the sucker away .
Have a bath . ”

NTM expert Joseph Falkinham of Virginia
Tech in Blacksburg says this type of data is needed to prepare a risk assessment , but we also need to know how many NTM of each species and type are needed to cause disease .
“ That is unknown for humans and not well established for laboratory animals either , ” he says .

Scientists use crater distributions to tell the ages of planetary surfaces on rocky bodies .
But how can the ages of gas planets be determined ?
Believe it or not , possibly from craters .
Scientists from the National Institute of Astrophysics in Rome say that crater patterns on the two largest asteroids in the asteroid belt , Vesta and Ceres , could help pinpoint when Jupiter began to form during the evolution of the early Solar System .
Their study modeling the cratering history of the two asteroids – which are believed to be among the oldest in the Solar System — indicates that the type and distribution of craters would show marked changes at different stages of Jupiter ’s development .
The study explored the hypothesis that one of the asteroids , or perhaps both objects , formed at the same time as Jupiter , and that studying their cratering histories could provide information about the birth of the giant planet .
The team ’s simulation described Jupiter ’s formation in three stages : an initial accretion of its core followed by a stage of rapid gas accretion .
This is , in turn , followed by a phase where the gas accretion slows down while the giant planet reaches its final mass .
During the last two phases Jupiter ’s gravitational pull starts to affect more and more distant objects .
For each of these phases , the team simulated how Jupiter affected the orbits of asteroids and comets from the inner and outer Solar System , and the likelihood of them being moved onto a collision path with Vesta or Ceres .
“ We found that the stage of Jupiter ’s development made a big difference on the speed of impacts and the origin of potential impactors , ” said Dr. Diego Turrini , from the research team .
“ When Jupiter ’s core approaches its critical mass , it causes a sharp increase in low - velocity impacts from small , rocky bodies orbiting nearby to Vesta and Ceres which lead to intense and uniform crater distribution patterns .
These low - speed collisions may have helped Vesta and Ceres gather mass .
Once Jupiter ’s core has formed and the planet starts to rapidly accrete gas , it deflects more distant objects onto a collision course with Ceres and Vesta and the impacts become more energetic .
Although rocky objects from the inner Solar System are the dominant impactors at this stage , the higher energies of collisions with icy bodies from the outer Solar System make the biggest mark . ”
The third stage of Jupiter ’s formation is complicated by a period known as the Late Heavy Bombardment , which occurred around 3.8 – 4.1 billion years ago .
During this time a significant number of objects , rich in organic compounds , from the outer Solar System were injected on planet - crossing orbits with the giant planets and may have reached the Asteroid Belt .
In addition , Jupiter is thought to have migrated in its orbit around this time , which would have caused an addition flux of impactors on Vesta and Ceres .
The team will have an opportunity to confirm their results when NASA ’s Dawn space mission reaches Vesta in 2011 and then flies on for a further rendezvous with Ceres in 2015 .
Dawn will gather information on the structure and the surface morphology of the two asteroids and send back high - resolution images of crater patterns .
Although the two asteroids are thought to have formed close to each other , they are quite different .
Vesta is a rocky body , while Ceres is believed to contain large quantities of ice .
“ If we can see evidence of an underlying intense , uniform crater pattern , it will support the theory that one or both of these minor planets formed during the final phases of Jupiter accretion , provided that they are n’t obliterated by the later heavy bombardment , ” said Turrini .
“ Dawn will also measure concentrations of organic material , which may give us further information about the collisional history with organic - rich objects from the outer Solar System . ”
The science team discussed their results at the European Planetary Science Congress in Potsdam , Germany .

Nature moves in mysterious ways , especially animals !
Without further ado , here are 10 of the most amazing animal abilities in the world .
Bats : Sound - trippers
One look and it ’s clear to see that bats are extraordinary creatures .
First and foremost , bat are mammals , not birds , which is why their bodies are covered with hair and not feathers .
Also , bats are nocturnal animals , unlike most other birds .
The bat ’s weirdest , and 10th most amazing on this list , characteristic is its ability to navigate the darkness with the use of soundwaves .
Bats emit ultrasonic squeaks that bounces off of insects and other objects the soundwave comes into contact with .
Then , from the echo , the bat determines the size , shape and distance of the object up ahead .
Look Ma , no eyes !
Sharks : Natural - born hunters
Sharks are some of the fiercest natural hunters on the planet .
Period .
When I say natural , it means no training involved whatsoever .
Father sharks and mother sharks do n’t teach baby sharks to hunt .
That would be so sissy in the shark world .
Sharks are born with special cells in their brains that allow them to track down even the smallest fish hiding under sand on the ocean floor .
These cells are sensitive to electrical fields in the water .
When a fish swims or even breathes , the water around it generates electrical pulses that go off in every direction .
A shark can pick up these signals from a mile away , and when it does , somebody ought to start swimming !
Boa : Night eaters
There ’s no question snakes are some of the most dangerous creatures in the world .
Snakes are feared for their poisonous bite as well as slithery and uncanny appearance .
What separates the boa from other snakes is its amazing ability to hunt under zero visibility .
Boas possess temperature - sensitive receptors located between the eyes and nostrils .
These organs can detect body heat from a considerable distance , in complete darkness , and therefore allow the boa to hunt as effectively at night as it does during the day .
Hummingbirds : Pint - sized helicopters Hummingbirds are as cute as they come .
In spite of their small size , hummingbirds never fail to inspire awe from any keen birdwatcher .
However , these tiny birds are n’t as weak and clumsy as most people think .
The truth is , hummingbirds are born with several talents .
First and foremost is the bird ’s ability to hover in mid-air .
No other bird can do that .
In fact , their wings are so agile that most hummingbirds can go as fast as 15 - 80 wing flaps per second .
The other talent is their ability to perceive colors that are well outside the visible range of human beings .
Cats : Garfield wearing night vision Everyone loves cats .
But cats can be as cunning as they are timid .
In the novel Kafka on the Shore , Haruki Murakami created a surrealist world where leeches fall down from the sky and cats converse with people .
Cats ca n’t talk to people in the real world , but they ’re capable of something else just as impressive .
Cats are some of the most visually keen animals in the world .
They ’re born with special eyes that allow them to move around and hunt in complete darkness .
Even the tiniest movement of a house rat is enough to jolt our feline friend out of a deep sleep .
“ So that ’s how Hershey was able to run after and catch all those mice in the kitchen , ” you ’re saying to yourself .
Yes , that ’s probably it .
Snakes : Feisty reptiles
The mental image of a snake flicking its tongue is disturbing at the very least , but did you know it ’s actually just sniffing the air around it ?
They ’re smelling around them just as you do when you go to the bakery early in the morning and are greeted by the warm smell of fresh bread and lemon pie cooking in the kiln .
Snakes are n’t the friendliest creatures , but they ’re definitely some of the most amazing .
Most snakes use their tongues to collect particles in the air ( the nostrils are used solely for breathing ) .
When the snake pulls its tongue back in , the particles are absorbed into special pits located along the roof of the snake ’s mouth .
And then … Oooohhh … smells like roses !
Moths : Love bugs
If you could be any insect , why not become a moth ?
Moths are literally love bugs .
Remind yourself that love is literally in the air the next time you see a moth fluttering about the corners of the room or along the window sill .
Moths have the amazing ability to detect love signals , called pheromones , in the air .
These signals are emitted by the opposite sex from up to seven miles away .
That ’s a lot of distance .
According to new studies , human can detect pheromones too , but only during close encounters .
Rats : Mischievous feelers
Rats do n’t have very good eyesight , but the common misconception is that rats have eyes as good as the type people are born with , sometimes even better — and nothing could be further from the truth .
Most species of rats , or most rats in general , have poor eyesight .
The truth is they probably ca n’t see all that well during the day , let alone at night ( when rats are known to scurry out of their hiding places in search of food ) .
What rats lack in vision they more than make up for with touch sensitivity .
The whiskers on their snouts are so sensitive that rats are capable of determining the size of objects and feeling their way into their surroundings just be touching them with their whiskers .
Drum Fish :
No ear , all hear Most fish they have ears they use to absorb soundwaves in the water .
In short , fish use their ears for hearing , but the drum fish works it magic a little differently .
Drum fishes use their air bladders for hearing instead of their regular ears .
Also used to absorb oxygen content present in the water , the air bladder detects soundwaves which it then passes into the inner ear to be converted into electrical signals or pulses .
The signals are then sent to the fish ’s brain for interpretation .
Migratory Birds : Aviator navigator
When you go to the library or the shopping center , you rely on landmarks — shops , street names , etc — to tell you which way to go .
Some people ’s sense of direction ( or lack of it ) , still allows them to miss a turn or end up passing their destination .
That ’s exactly why migratory birds gets the honor of being the animal with the most amazing ability in the world : the ability to fly great distances and not get lost .
Researchers believe these birds are born with a form of synesthesia that allows them to see the Earth ’s magnetic lines that normal people can’t .
It may sound a little far - fetched , but a theory is better than no theory at all .

Software is more than just a bunch of numbers talking to a computer .
Software is a bond of trust between the engineer and the consumer .
In this light , Magnifier fails in no uncertain terms .
If my computer is like my house , and the system software is the interior amenities , then installing another piece of software is like installing a toilet .
The installer program is like a workman who I have tasked with the manual labor .
When I tasked Micro Soft with installing my interior I naturally assumed the toilet would be installed .
But Magnifier is like a toilet in the living room .
Now the workman has returned home and sent my money to his family in the South Americas and I cannot remove this toilet from my living room .
This is a violation of trust .
I cannot fathom how a man such as yourself can look himself in the mirror .
Maybe you do not have to .
Maybe you prefer your toilet in the living room where there are no mirrors to reflect your guilt back onto your unthinkable face .
For sir , that is the world you have created at Micro Soft :
An upside down computer world of toilets in the living room .
I expect in the future men like you will be put in prison for your shady craftsmanship and illegitimate business practices .
It should not be on my head to remove this inappropriate soft ware any more than it should be my responsibility to remove the ill - placed toilet that has been smelling up my den for the last 8 years .
I expect Manuel to remove it and I expect a refund and an apology .
Similarly I expect this Magnifer removed from my Vista program post haste and with immediateness .
There is still time to renew your soul sir and apologize to me , the public and to Jesus the Christ .

* Warning – Boring Political Talk Below *
City Council has little effect on state laws , but the Municipal Services , Facilities and Infrastructure Committee voted to recommend that the City Council draft resolutions related to marijuana use for submission to State offices in Concord .
Wednesday evening , the Municipal Services , Facilities and Infrastructure Committee of the Keene City Council voted 4 - 1 to recommend the full council support medical marijuana legalization AND 3 - 2 to recommend the support of decriminalization of personal amounts of marijuana .
The most vocal detractor , Mr. Greenwald , made it clear that he was voting “ no ” because he did n’t feel the issue to be something the City Council should be handling , and not because he disagreed with the idea .
The committee acted on this due to the pushing from a seemingly unlikely source .
Former KPD detective Fred Parsells submitted the letter at the bottom of this post to the Mayor and City Council , as well as spoke to the committee .
In favor of the resolution for medical marijuana : Arnold Bailey , Pamela Slack , Charles Redfern , and Ruth Venezia .
Bailey opposed the decrim resolution .
If adopted , this decision still has no legal effect , but means that the City Council will draft a resolution and submit to Concord in support of these marijuana freedoms .
The full council will be voting on these issues at the next meeting , September 17 , 2009 .
· Here is audio of Mr. Parsells ’ speech to the committee .
( Length – 14:17 )
· Also , here is audio of blogger Nick Ryder speaking in support of Mr. Parsells ’ letter , and his response to that .
( Length – 02:10 )
And the letter that prompted the action :
Dear Mayor and Council :
An incumbent city councilor was recently asked by an individual representing a particular point of view if said councilor would be willing to propose language to the full council which would , in so many words , direct the Keene Police Department to make enforcement of minimal marijuana possession laws its lowest enforcement priority .
Even if it had the mind to do so , I do not believe that the council has the legal right to dictate such a policy .
That said , the idea did prompt the councilor and me to engage in conversation regarding medical marijuana and the decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal consumption .
Little did I suspect thirty and more years ago that I would ever be writing such a letter as is now before you .
Some of you will know that I have the perspective of having been involved in three so - called wars in my life .
Governmental actions in and against Vietnam , crime and drugs were and are all referred to by the media as wars against the noted actions .
I was involved in all of them .
I mean no disrespect to those I served with , both at home and abroad , but I would be remiss if I did not point out that I have yet to be on the winning side .
Focusing on the medical marijuana issue for a moment , I strongly believe that New Hampshire ’s elected leaders missed an opportunity to do the right thing for those who would benefit from their ability to legally use marijuana as they confront medical issues .
I urge you to adopt a resolution and communicate it to our leaders in Concord encouraging them to pass a medical marijuana usage law .
But now for the larger issue and where I believe that you as councilors can , if you have the mind to do so , have some influence at the state level .
I similarly urge you to endorse a resolution expressing your collective belief that minimal possession of marijuana for personal consumption should be decriminalized .
While I do n’t believe that you have the legal authority to direct the police department to act as was suggested above , I know that you have the authority , and I believe the moral imperative , to express your concern to those in Concord about the many state and local dollars being spent and the young people ’s futnres being ruined by misdemeanor level marijuana drug possession criminal records for perhaps a moment ’s indiscretion .
Please know that I am not talking about going to jail for the noted offense as the means of ruination but rather about the criminal record that will follow the youthful offender forever .
There is much more to be said on this matter that space does not allow , but I look forward to the opportunity to come before you and express my beliefs more fully .
Respectfully and sincerely ,
Frederick B. Parsells

US Personal Income has taken its worst annual decline since 1950 .
This is why it is an improbable fantasy to think that the consumer will be able to pull this economy out of recession using the normal ‘ print and trickle down ’ approach .
In the 1950 ’s the solution was huge public works projects like the Interstate Highway System and of course the Korean War .
Until the median wage improves relative to the cost of living , there will be no recovery .
And by cost of living we do not mean the chimerical US Consumer Price Index .
The classic Austrian prescription is to allow prices to decline until the median wage becomes adequate .
Given the risk of a deflationary wage - price spiral , which is desired by no one except for the cash rich , the political risks of such an approach are enormous .
On paper it is obvious that a market can ‘ clear ’ at a variety of levels , if wages and prices are allowed to move freely .
After all , if profits are diminished , income can obviously be diminished by a proportional amount , and nothing has really changed in terms of viable consumption .
The Supply side idealists ( cash rich bosses , Austrians , neo- liberal , monetarist , and deflationist theorists ) would like to see this happen at a lower level through a deflationary spiral .
The Keynesians and neo-classicals wish to see it driven through the Demand side , with higher wages rising to meet the demands of profit in an inflationary expansion .
Both believe that market forces alone can achieve this equilibrium .
Across both groups runs a sub-category of statism vs. individualism .
Unfortunately both groups are wrong .
Both approaches require an ideal , almost frictionless , objectively rational , and honest economy in order to succeed .
The Keynesians have a bit of an edge in this , because it is easier to control inflation than deflation in a fiat regime , and the natural growth of inflation tends to satiate the impulse to greed .
They do n’t care if they can buy more as long as they can say they HAVE more .
People tend to be irrational , and there is a percentage of the population that is irrationally greedy and obsessively rapacious .
People are not naturally ‘ good . ’
The greatest flaw in the many studies that come from each of the schools to prove their point is the brutal way in which they flatten the reality of the markets and make assumptions to allow their equations and analysis to ‘ work . ’
They spend most of their energy showing while the ‘ other school ’ is a group of ignorant fools , doomed to ignominious failure , in an atmosphere reminiscent of a university departmental meeting .
This has quietly scandalized those from other scientific disciplines who review the work of many of the leading economists .
Benoit Mandelbrot was poking enormous holes in the work of the leading economists long before Nassim Taleb made it more widely known .
The ugly truth is that economics is a science in the way that medicine was a profession while it still used leeches to balance a person ’s vapours .
Yes , some are always better than others , and certainly more entertaining , but they all tended to kill their patients .
The most intractable part of the current financial crisis , and the ongoing problem of the US economy is the huge tax which is levied on the American public by its corporations , primarily in the financial and health care sectors , and a political system based on lobbyists and their campaign contributions .
There are hidden taxes and impediments to ‘ free trade ’ at every turn .
The ugly truth is that capitalism - in - practice hates free markets , always seeking to overturn the rules and impose oligopoly if not outright monopoly through barriers to entry , manipulation of the political process , distortion of regulation , predatory pricing , brute force , and the usual slate of anti-trust practices .
Some of these ‘ hidden taxes ’ are the bonuses on Wall Street which require an increasing percentage of the financial ‘ action . ’
The credit cards fees and penalties levied by banks to support profits in a contracting economy .
The Sales General & Administrative portion of the Income Statements of the pharmaceutical industry which only American consumers seem willing to pay .
A health care system which is a monument to overspending , outrageous pricing , and greed .
The notion that “ if only government would not regulate markets at all everything would be fine ” is a variation of Rousseau ’s romantic notion of the noble savage which no one believes except those who wish to continue to act like savages , and those who get no closer to the real work of an economy than their textbooks .
Economic Darwinism works primarily to the advantage of the sharks .
Anyone who believes that ‘ no regulations ’ works well has never driven on a modern highway at peak periods .
Yes , a certain portion of the population are adult , and generally good and fair .
But there is a percentage of the population that is not .
And since the 1980 ’s they have been encouraged by the culture of relativism and greed to ‘ express themselves ’ and so they have , with a vengeance .
Discussion rarely proceeds very far because of the dialectical nature of American thought .
Both extremes are wrong , but they seem to content to merely bash each other , pointing out their errors , while repeating the same mistakes over and again .
The engineering of the economy has become married to the engineering of the political dialogue by the corporate media and their political parties .
“ The engineering of consent is the very essence of the democratic process , the freedom to persuade and suggest . ”
Edward L. Bernays 1947
The condition of the American economy is strikingly similar to the Soviet state economy of the last two decades of the 20th century .
People are trying to sustain a system “ as is ” that is based on bad assumptions , unworkable constructions , conflicting objectives , and a flagging empire laced heavily with elitist fraud and corruption .
The primary difference is that the US has a bigger gun and its hand is in more people ’s pockets with the dollar as the world ’s reserve currency .
But the comparison seems to indicate that the economy must indeed fail first , before genuine change can begin , because the familiar ideology and practices must clearly fail before they can recede sufficiently to make room for new ways and reforms .
A new school of Economics will rise out of the ashes of the failure of the American economy as happened after the Great Depression .
Let us hope that it is better than what we have today .
In the short term , what does all this mean ?
There is NO system that will work without substantial , continuing effort , and continual adaptation and commitment to a certain set of goals that are more about ‘ ends ’ than ideological process .
Because our system has been abused for so long , and is so distorted and imbalanced and dominated by a relatively few organizations beholden to a self - serving status quo , reform is not an afterthought , it is the sine qua non .
It means that until the banks are restrained , and the financial system is reformed , and balance is restored , there can be no sustained recovery .
TO CORRECT a spelling on an airline ticket , Flight Centre and Etihad charged Souhala Toughlajian $ 650 - that was with a discount .
Like many born in non-English - speaking nations , Mrs Toughlajian 's name is spelt differently on her Lebanese passport ( Souhaila Toghlajian ) from her current Australian passport ( Souhaly Toughlajian ) .
To complicate matters , she goes by Souhala Toughlajian .
So Ada Toughlajian rang her mum in Belmore from a CBD Flight Centre to check the spelling for a booking in June but the 78 - year - old quoted her expired Lebanese travel document .
Ada knew there was a risk her mum had it wrong but it was the last day of a sale .
Ada did n't want mum to miss a seemingly cut -price Beirut return fare of $ 2060 .
She did n't know of the obscene $ 750 fee for fixing spelling - or that the fare would drop more than $ 200 after the " sale " .
In July Flight Centre waived its part of the charge , which it said was $ 100 .
But this week I discovered Flight Centre 's true take was $ 420 .
How ?
I just asked Etihad what its share was .
The response was about the only straight answer I got from the United Arab Emirates carrier .
Etihad spokeswoman Anne Tullis even asserted it was not possible Mrs Toughlajian 's name could be spelt different ways on different passports , despite them being issued 40 years apart .
Canberra's
Lebanese embassy said this was common among former citizens .

Ada , angered by the treatment , arranged a Malaysian Airlines ticket for just $ 1500 with another travel company .
She also took Flight Centre to the NSW Consumer , Trade and Tenancy Tribunal .
Although it is now off the hook after promising me it would cough up its true take , the CTTT made Etihad a respondent to Ada 's action .
Coincidentally in coming weeks I 'm writing on CTTT experiences .

If you ’re a girl and have big boobs you should consider modeling for SCORE because going to the Caribbean to frolic around naked on a beach does n’t sound like a bad deal to me .
Oh , and you would also get paid for it !!

What in the hell is going on ?
Have most all in this country lost their minds and their spirit , or concerning freedom , is apathy all that remains ?
Oh to be a conspiracy theorist !
Everything today in actuality is conspiratorial , and those who have been continuously demoralized for their constant suspicions of government are now the only sane ones left .
This is evident because " 1984 " is no longer fiction ; it is reality !
The latest crime in a long line of usurpations of liberty by government evildoers has now effectively eliminated privacy as we know it .
As reported on LRC and told by Glenn Beck , anyone accessing the " cash for clunkers " program literally gives up ownership of their computer to the federal government .
Before you say or even think anything , please understand that I fully realize that no real libertarian would ever take government cash in the form of welfare .
You might say that those taking taxpayer cash for a car deserve to be monitored for participating in this government redistribution scheme , but you may want to think before you speak .
If government can get into their computers , it can just as easily get into yours .
This invasion is only the tip of the iceberg .
All should be alarmed and all should be wary of current events .
The government has become so brazen that it fears not any citizen outrage or exposure over its stealing of rights .
The actions of government are exposed and openly discussed , but few it seems take heed .
The text of the Privacy Act and Security Statement at cars.gov , reads as follows :
" This application provides access to the DOT CARS system .
When logged into the CARS system , your computer is considered a Federal computer system , and is the property of the U.S. Government .
Any or all uses of this system and all files on this system may be intercepted , monitored , recorded , copied , audited , inspected , and disclosed to authorized CARS , DOT and law enforcement personnel , as well as authorized officials of other agencies , both domestic and foreign . "

Yes , you read that right .
The government now claims to own your computer , and every single file and every single piece of information on your computer .
Not only does government now own it , but it can use that information to harm and arrest you , to share your private information with anyone or any entity it chooses , including the police state enforcers , and at any time .
In addition , once the government is inside , it never leaves !
This is done by the way , without any probable cause and no warrant is ever issued .
Many will say , as is always the case , " Well , this does n’t apply to me , because I ’m not getting any cash for clunkers . "
" Ah contraire " !
I am continually amazed at the gullibility of the masses , and this is why I think that " conspiracy nuts " and government watchdogs are the brightest among us and the ones always prepared for the inevitable fall .
I wish there were many more people who were as skeptical of government .
Now let ’s get to the meat of it !
This tyrannical and fascist federal government can do virtually anything it wants to , and at any time , and will do so under the guise of " legality . "
Yes , in today ’s world , everything the government does to us and against us is claimed to be legal .
That is because it is " the law . "
Once law became positive instead of negative , freedom took a proverbial back seat .
Oh , if only freedom today could still be in the back seat , instead of locked away in the trunk .
As Frederic Bastiat said ; " Law is force . "
This has never been more evident than it is today .
This is obviously not a force for good ( actually no such force exists ) but a force used to advance the immoral and evil police state .
My God , what have we allowed to happen ?

To examine just a handful of adverse consequences due to recent events should help us all to understand the implications of our complacency .
If government can take over , monitor and consume everything on your computer if you access the CARS site , then it stands to reason that government probably is already or has the capability to get inside all private computer systems .
What if you have a phone line linked through your computer such as Vonage , Skype , etc . ?
We all know that our phones have been tapped and monitored for some time .
So does n’t it stand to reason that if the government wants on your computer and only has to access a phone line to do so , it will ?
What if you have visited any government website ?
Does n’t it also stand to reason that if the government can access any computer that logs on to the " cash for clunkers " site , it can do the same with any government site via tracking cookies , etc . ?
And how many sites are government - controlled ?
Every time I check river water levels for fishing conditions , I ’m on a government site .
Every time I check the weather on NOAA ; every time I check government unemployment , spending , and deficit numbers ; every time I check current legislation pending in congress , and on and on , I am linked to a government computer .
Given what is going on with the CARS site , could n’t my computer be compromised in any of these situations ?
Add to this :
Financial transaction monitoring and data - basing of private information that is taking place every day via financial institutions
Intrusions concerning anti-money laundering legislation
Unconstitutional wiretaps
Unconstitutional searches
TSA ( enough said )
Government and police - state camera monitoring
Census invasions and data - basing of individual ’s private information
GPS monitoring by government of every home in America
Medical record consolidation and capture by government
Real ID or the now PASS ID systems
These are but a few of the invasions and monitoring techniques used by government .
Many , many more examples exist and many more are unknown .
In other words , everything we do is watched , monitored , and data - based ; our privacy invaded and our natural rights trampled .

The military industrial complex is now also a domestic police force ; ready , willing and able to do the bidding of Leviathan .
It can and will be used to stop civil unrest , to force mandatory vaccinations , to imprison those willing to stand their ground , to disarm and evacuate by force citizens from their homes , and to uphold Martial Law if ordered to do so .
In addition , most every domestic police force is now militarized .
The elite in our society , along with the powerbrokers in politics will be protected from this scourge , but the rest of us will suffer the consequences of our lost freedom .
As is continually uttered by the " conservative " crowd , " Freedom is not free , " but no armed government agent in the military industrial complex has or ever will protect our freedom ; quite the contrary .
Only we as individuals can retain and save our liberty .
Many brutal political " leaders " of the past like Hitler , Stalin , Mao and Mussolini attempted to monitor and control all citizens and their behavior .
The end results were telling , and they were horrible .
Mass murder at the hands of the state was the rule not the exception .
Starvation was prevalent and sickness was constant .
Wars consumed production and economies collapsed .
Freedom was unheard of during the reign of these monsters .
Can you imagine the political and monitoring capabilities of today being available to those brutal tyrants of the past ?
There is a reason that the U.S. federal government has taken over and co-opted all the means of society .
This same government now controls and monitors all money , banking , transportation , health care , police , and communication , including the internet .
Those dictators I mentioned above did not have this capability , and still mass oppression won the day .
If this history is any guide , our future looks bleak .
All power and control lies in the hands of the few who claim to represent us .
They are collectively the autocratic federal government .
Life ’s lessons tell us that those who have the power make the rules .
Any who believe that these rules will benefit life , liberty and property are fools , and are doomed to the inevitable and disastrous repeat of history .
The power possessed by these current tyrants will not be reined in by " change " as the political process is forever flawed .
No , this power must be eliminated !
The Best of Gary D. Barnett
Arsène Wenger has reopened hostilities between Manchester United and Arsenal by accusing the Premier League champions of using " anti-football " tactics during their 2 - 1 victory at Old Trafford on Saturday .
Wenger is to receive an official apology for being banished from the dugout but he remains incensed by the " Old Trafford - ish " standard of refereeing and his conviction that Sir Alex Ferguson 's players , predominantly Darren Fletcher , were guilty of systematic fouling .
After a period of relative calm between Wenger and Ferguson the allegations will go down badly at Old Trafford after a match in which Arsenal had six players booked , triggering an automatic £ 25,000 fine from the Football Association .
The conduct of Wenger 's players was also brought into question by Emmanuel Eboué being shown a yellow card for diving , a day after Eduardo da Silva had been charged by Uefa for " deceiving the referee " for a similar offence , but the Arsenal manager insisted the " bigger problem " in football was of players being allowed to get away with persistent and deliberate fouling – and he pointed an accusatory finger at Ferguson 's men .
" There are other points [ than diving ] that , for me , are more urgent – players who play only to make fouls and who are never punished ; players who make repeated fouls and who get out of the game without a yellow card .
That , for me , is more anti-football than a player who did what Eduardo did . "
Wenger was asked to clarify whether he meant Fletcher and laughed , replying with mock surprise : " Why do you say the name ? "
Fletcher had given away six free - kicks , twice as many as any of his team - mates , but was not one of the three United players to get a yellow card .
" I have seen a player who plays only on the pitch to make repeated fouls , " Wenger continued .
" Look at how many deliberate fouls some players make and get away with .
I think that 's a bigger problem [ than diving ] because it cuts the flow of the game .
And people come and pay to see football .
They do not come to see free ‑kicks .
You should ask the referees [ how they get away with it ] . "
Wenger has accused Ferguson 's players of using similar tactics in the past , most notably saying his team had been " kicked off the pitch " at Old Trafford during the 2004 - 05 season .
It was put to him that he had previously suspected this was a deliberate part of United 's strategy .
" You will have to ask them , " he replied .
On this occasion , however , the Frenchman may have opened himself to allegations of diversion tactics at a time when Eduardo and , to a lesser extent , Eboué have embarrassed the club .
Robin van Persie also gave away six free - kicks even if , unlike Fletcher , he was booked .
The manager who has become infamous for his insistence that he did not see controversial incidents did , at least , recognise did recognise that Eboué had tried to win a free - kick by going down under a non-existent challenge , but there was no condemnation and , likewise , he continued to insist that Eduardo was the victim of a Uefa " witch - hunt . "
He said : " I think it is difficult with diving .
Sometimes players dive to escape being hit .
It 's not always necessarily diving because you want to dive .
Sometimes it 's a way of getting out of the way .
The borderline between being sensible , being shrewd or being a cheat is very slim so , in some cases , to assess which is which is very difficult . "
Arsenal , he insisted , were a club that did not tolerate diving .
" I like that , " he said , when asked whether it mattered more in England than other countries .
" I think it 's a quality in this country .
In some countries it is a quality to dive .
I 'm still more proud to be part of England where they fight against that . "
The referee , Mike Dean , acting on the advice of the fourth official , Lee Probert , sent off Wenger in the final moments of Saturday 's game for kicking a water bottle in frustration after a disallowed goal .
However , the FA is unlikely to take disciplinary action .
Instead , the League Managers ' Association chief executive , Richard Bevan , spoke to the Premier League referees ' chief , Keith Hackett , and was informed that Wenger would receive an apology .
" Although [ the decision was ] correct in law , it was completely out of context in the game and it was followed by the nonsense over where Wenger should sit , " Bevan said .
" I 've spoken to Keith Hackett and he fully recognises the situation was an error and an apology will follow .
Lee Probert totally failed to manage the situation and created a needless pressure point , taking the focus away from the pitch in a big event with only a minute to go . "
Eduardo will discover on Tuesday whether Uefa is to ban him for the exaggerated fall that led to Arsenal winning a penalty in their 3 - 1 defeat of Celtic in last week 's Champions League qualifiers .
Arsenal will fight his case and Wenger said the club had television pictures to prove that the forward had been touched by Celtic 's goalkeeper , Artur Boruc .
" Uefa have made the case of Eduardo .
If you watch the Super Cup on Friday then they will have to charge ( Lionel ) Messi for headbutting or they will lose credibility .
They have opened something there that over the weekend I 'll find you 50 situations where they can intervene , or if they do n't Eduardo will be singled out for being a wrong victim .
I do not want Messi to be punished but if they go for Eduardo then people will demand it .
Pedro , also of Barcelona , dived as well [ in the Super Cup ] and so I do n't think there 's any logic to Eduardo 's case .
We have clear proof that from behind he was touched on his right leg . "
Wenger is suspicious about the number of Scots in prominent positions at Uefa and added : " There is no common sense .
I believe it was a more emotional decision really because if Uefa had said before the season starts , ' Listen , let 's get together and no matter what happens in Uefa games , if we suspect someone of diving he will be punished ' then you could say , OK , we 've always been told they will do that .
But suddenly , out from nowhere because it was an emotional situation in Scotland , we have this situation and have to live with that . "

Although the US and other nations currently produce ethanol from the sugars and starches of crops like sugar cane and corn , ethanol is n't a good match for our existing fuel infrastructure — and this form of production runs the risk of putting energy in competition with food production for resources like land and water .
As a result , attention has shifted to figuring out how to produce a new generation of biofuels from different sources that more closely approximate the diesel and gasoline in use today .
Yesterday 's edition of Science contained a perspective on the prospects for these next - generation biofuels .
Although it 's very short , only a page long , it contains an excellent list of references to very current publications .
The diversity of approaches it covers highlights how many options there are to produce different fuels , each with its own advantages and drawbacks .
In the following sections , we 'll discuss different methods of producing biofuels ; although the text presents them as alternatives , it 's important to emphasize that there are significant overlaps among them , and more than one technology might emerge for widespread use .
Cellulose or lipids :
The first question is what you want the initial fuel stock to be .
Cellulose , a polymerized sugar , is found in combination with proteins and other compounds ; together , they provide plants with their structure .
It 's available in abundance , and all sources of cellulose are more or less functionally equivalent , so a cellulose processing facility could work with a huge range of sources : agricultural waste , wood waste from lumber processing , leftover construction material , and dedicated biofuel crops like switchgrass .
A recent USDA report suggests that the US has an annual supply of a billion tons of cellulose to work with .
The problem is that cellulose does n't break down easily or quickly , and its component parts — sugars and proteins — lend themselves most readily to the production of ethanol .
The alternative is to go with something like lipids , which are long - chained hydrocarbons that are chemically more similar to fuels .
As with cellulose , a lipid is a lipid , regardless of the source .
Unfortunately , there are far fewer sources , since plants do n't generally contain an excess of them .
In a few cases , lipid - processing facilities have been built to operate using the waste from meat packing plants , but a larger source of lipids would require the development of an algae that grows well in waste or salt water .
Industrial or biological :
Once the material itself is isolated , it generally needs processing before it 's ready for use as fuel .
Here , working with lipids has huge advantages , as they can generally be fed into the same sort of reactions that are used during oil refining .
Cellulose is another matter .
Several industrial processes can quickly break it down into more chemically - flexible components , but all of them require elevated temperatures and pressures , and thus a substantial energy input .
Once broken down , catalysts can rearrange the simpler components into usable fuels .
But there are significant barriers to using the processes which we 've already developed , designed to handle relatively pure mixtures .
It 's difficult to fully eliminate water from cellulose , the plant material contains an unwanted mix of nitrogen and sulfur compounds , and the pH of the reaction material can be difficult to control .
Any one of these issues can interfere with the action of an essential catalyst , so finding a combination that provides high energy payback and works well with cellulose is n't a simple thing .
The alternative is to go biological , as there are organisms that make their living by digesting cellulose .
Unfortunately , as anyone knows who has ever seen downed trees rot , the process is extremely slow .
There are ways to speed it up , of course , but there 's a very clear trade - off between speed and energy input .
Once it 's digested , researchers still face the challenge of finding a way to convert its component sugars to something more useful than ethanol .
Existing or engineered organisms :
The ideal situation , of course , would be to have an organism that does everything for us , from digesting ethanol to spitting out some sort of lipid derivative that can be fed directly into fuel tanks .
Life , however , is rarely that simple ; evolution tends to frown upon organisms that release energetically valuable chemicals into their environments , and we'd be growing any biofuel organisms in the sorts of numbers that allow evolution plenty of opportunity .
That said , there are some organisms that happen to do some very convenient things on their own , like a bacterial strain that stores energy in lipids to such a degree that nearly 80 percent of its dry mass is in lipids .
Unfortunately , we know almost nothing else about the strain , including the details of metabolism and whether they can be engineered in the same way we handle more common bacteria , like E. coli .
And some form of engineering would almost certainly be needed if we 're going to have them growing on cellulose .
The alternative approach would be to take an organism we do know well , like E. coli , and engineer it so that it could digest cellulose and directly produce a chemical that could be easily converted to fuel .
( A review of microbial fuels lists a variety of intermediate - chain hydrocarbons and alcohols that might work . )
A sufficiently hydrophobic liquid , once outside the cell , should separate from the liquid the bacteria are growing in , allowing easy harvesting .
But , at the moment , we only have limited experience with re-engineering an organism 's metabolism to do something that might not do said organism much good .
Because of all the complex trade - offs , it 's likely that there wo n't be a one - size - fits - all biofuel solution , but the energy available to us ( based on the USDA report ) is substantial and could dramatically cut our imports of fossil fuels — up to 30 percent , based on a report that predates the recently tightened fuel economy standards .
Fortunately , it appears that the market is taking the advice of the National Academies and developing a portfolio of approaches .
The Science perspective notes that a handful of companies already claim they 're on track to begin producing non-ethanol biofuels on the scale of millions of gallons within the next five years , and more will join them within the next decade .
Although none of them are giving away the precise details of what they 're up to , it 's clear that they are taking a variety of different approaches to producing that fuel .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - The Prius hybrid automobile is popular for its fuel efficiency , but its electric motor and battery guzzle rare earth metals , a little - known class of elements found in a wide range of gadgets and consumer goods .

That makes Toyota ’s market - leading gasoline - electric hybrid car and other similar vehicles vulnerable to a supply crunch predicted by experts as China , the world ’s dominant rare earths producer , limits exports while global demand swells .
Worldwide demand for rare earths , covering 15 entries on the periodic table of elements , is expected to exceed supply by some 40,000 tonnes annually in several years unless major new production sources are developed .
One promising U.S. source is a rare earths mine slated to reopen in California by 2012 .
Among the rare earths that would be most affected in a shortage is neodymium , the key component of an alloy used to make the high - power , lightweight magnets for electric motors of hybrid cars , such as the Prius , Honda Insight and Ford Focus , as well as in generators for wind turbines .
Close cousins terbium and dysprosium are added in smaller amounts to the alloy to preserve neodymium ’s magnetic properties at high temperatures .
Yet another rare earth metal , lanthanum , is a major ingredient for hybrid car batteries .
Production of both hybrids cars and wind turbines is expected to climb sharply amid the clamor for cleaner transportation and energy alternatives that reduce dependence on fossil fuels blamed for global climate change .
Toyota has 70 percent of the U.S. market for vehicles powered by a combination of an internal - combustion engine and electric motor .
The Prius is its No. 1 hybrid seller .
Jack Lifton , an independent commodities consultant and strategic metals expert , calls the Prius “ the biggest user of rare earths of any object in the world . ”
Each electric Prius motor requires 1 kilogram ( 2.2 lb ) of neodymium , and each battery uses 10 to 15 kg ( 22 - 33 lb ) of lanthanum .
That number will nearly double under Toyota ’s plans to boost the car ’s fuel economy , he said .
Toyota plans to sell 100,000 Prius cars in the United States alone for 2009 , and 180,000 next year .
The company forecasts sales of 1 million units per year starting in 2010 .
As China ’s industries begin to consume most of its own rare earth production , Toyota and other companies are seeking to secure reliable reserves for themselves .
Reuters reported last year that Japanese firms are showing strong interest in a Canadian rare earth site under development at Thor Lake in the Northwest Territories .
A Toyota spokeswoman in Los Angeles said the automaker would not comment on its resource development plans .
But media accounts and industry blogs have reported recently that Toyota has looked at rare earth possibilities in Canada and Vietnam .
Business Car Insurance
There are many types of car insurance policies that one can look into suiting to one ’s lifestyle and purpose .
From low cost car insurance premiums to auto owners ’ special policies , high risk insurance quotes , special insurance for teenagers , women and elderly people , there are different kinds to check out .
Depending on what you require and what it is you are looking for , the insurance style and premiums as well as benefits can differ a lot .
There are different car insurances like student car insurance , new car insurance , car accident insurance , motor vehicle insurance , auto collision insurance deals , group auto insurance , business owners ’ auto insurance , used car insurance , vintage car insurance and many more options that a good insurance company can clarify you with .
The protection , aim and coverage charges of different types of owners can differ from time to time .
For instance , business car insurance will have differing needs and varieties within itself and it can be customized specifically for your own special needs .
The best of insurance dealers would just not bring you financial benefits and insurance deals but way more important plans of having business insurance implemented for vehicles for further business development and uses .
There are many options of freeing your financial liabilities , if you have any , through appropriate business insurance policies and loans .
Bodily injury of vehicle and sudden mishap can be tended to through any of the insurance policies that you may choose to apply for that is one of the main criteria of any business policies .
However , there are particular insurance policies which are necessary , especially if you are in an area with frequent accidents or if you have been more prone to accidents recently .
Teen drivers may benefit greatly with special teenage beneficiary insurance policies .
They can also be given new drivers ’ insurance policy or special collision or auto accident insurance policies as generally teen drivers are less careful than old drivers .
However any insurance policy , when extended properly , is there to take care of any of your sudden financial liability .
It is a must for any car owners .
But the very special car insurances do make a lot of difference .
A vintage car owner or an old and retired person owning a car would have varied needs to themselves and for their cars .
These are specialized categories which need to be looked into .
What you may be getting from a particular kind of insurance you would not be getting from another .
These are the reasons why people should have a consultation , go through the pros and cons of the insurance live with an agent , mull over one ’s priorities very well and then go for the insurance .
Most companies are also flexible with the changing of the deal of their insurance policies .
With little or low charges these plans may be changed if it is a flexible insurance .
Operating through insurance from a responsible stance does let you be in that place where you get instant help from a mishap .
If for instance your business is in the construction department then you could do very well with the accident or collision prone insurance than any other .
Ultimately only you would know what kind of insurance you want and are ready for .
Democratic congressional reps James Clyburn , Barney Frank , Charles Rangel and a bunch of others wrote a letter to Treasury Secretatry Timothy Geithner asking him to make it easier for minority - owned local TV and radio stations to borrow money .
Reports TheHill.com :
The letter suggests Treasury could set up a credit facility specific to the industry , similar to the government ’s efforts to support auto suppliers , or possibly set up a program for bridge financing and government - backed loans until the economy improves .
The congressmen say the TV and radio stations are " fundamentally sound operations " that just need a little help while the recession keeps car makers and car dealers from advertising like they used to .
The letter does not mention that local TV and radio stations have also , in recent years , lost much of their business to online advertising , which is a new and innovative medium instead of an expensive old one .
Online ad spending passed radio ad spending for good way back in September 2007 .
During the same month -- before the current recession started -- TV advertising shrank 2.4 % while Internet advertising grew 17.7 % .
You can tell the congressmen know their bailout is bad for business , because they end up saying it is important not for commercial reason , but for cultural ones .
They write that “ while many jobs are at stake , a more important principle — the government ’s fundamental interest in promoting a diversity of voices , including service to underserved communities — is severely threatened . "
We do n't think any media should get a bailout -- not even our precious newspapers -- but if there 's going to be one to promote " a diversity of voices , including service to underserved communities , " why do n't we start with social network Black Planet or blog for hispanics Guanabe instead of ones for companies based on out - dated tech and irredeemably damaged business models ?
Other reps who signed the letter include : Reps. Bobby Rush ( Ill. ) , Edolphus Towns ( N.Y. ) , Maurice Hinchey ( N.Y. ) , Carolyn Maloney ( N.Y. ) , Maxine Waters ( Calif . ) , Gregory Meeks ( N.Y. ) , G.K. Butterfield ( N.C. ) , Barbara Lee ( Calif . ) , Lynn Woolsey ( Calif . ) and Bennie Thompson ( Miss . ) .
After rereading my earlier post , it occurred to me that it might be useful to lay out the logic of the argument .
What we observe is that private insurers spend a much larger fraction of their receipts on administration than Medicare does .
Heritage asserts that this is because administration costs are proportional to the number of beneficiaries , not spending , so Medicare has low percentage costs because its elderly beneficiaries are so much more expensive than average .
So how would you test this assertion ?
I can think of two obvious approaches : ( 1 ) Compare the administrative costs of different systems serving similar populations ( 2 ) Compare the administrative costs of similar systems serving different populations .
And we can do both of these things .
Medicare Advantage plans are private insurance serving the elderly population .
So this is a case of different systems serving similar populations .
( Medicare Advantage clients are probably somewhat healthier than the average senior , but the average cost of their health care is still very high . )
If costs depended mainly on number of people , these plans should have low administrative costs as a percentage of spending .
They do n’t — their numbers look like those of private insurance in general .
Meanwhile , other countries have Medicare - like systems that cover low - cost as well as high - cost individuals .
Canada ’s system is actually called Medicare .
So this is a similar system covering a different , lower - cost population .
If costs depended on the number of people , Canada should have high administrative costs ; in fact , its numbers look like those of American Medicare ( actually even better . )
This seems like fairly overwhelming evidence that single - payer systems do , in fact , have low administrative costs compared with private insurers .
To argue that this does n’t clinch the case , you have to resort to pretty desperate expedients ; for example , one of my commenters says that the CBO study of administrative costs ca n’t be trusted , because Democrats control Congress .
( The CBO bends over backwards to be nonpartisan — and anyway , the study was done in 2006 , when Republicans were still in control . )
I know that some people find that answer unacceptable : they know that the private sector is always more efficient than the government , and no amount of evidence will shake their faith .
But that ’s what the evidence shows .
ALAMEDA , Calif . --
The Oakland Raiders took a big step toward improving their struggling run defense by acquiring five - time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Richard Seymour from the New England Patriots on Sunday .
The move does not come without its risks as the Raiders gave up a first - round pick in 2011 , which could be in the top 10 based on Oakland 's recent history , to acquire a lineman who turns 30 next month and is in the final year of a contract paying him $ 3.685 million this season .
Raiders owner Al Davis wanted immediate help for a defense that has struggled to stop the run in recent seasons .
Since going to the Super Bowl following the 2002 season , Oakland has had the worst run defense in the NFL , allowing 141.7 yards per game on the ground and 122 touchdowns rushing .
The Raiders have allowed a 100 - yard rusher in more than half of their games the past three years .
" It shows the commitment of this organization , " defensive end Greg Ellis said .
" You can't guarantee we 're going to have a great , great season this year .
But the commitment is definitely there so players do n't have to question that when you 're making those kinds of moves to make something happen and hopefully win right now . "
Seymour has been a stalwart in New England since being drafted sixth overall in 2001 .
He played on three Super Bowl winners with the Patriots , recording 39 career sacks and being selected to the Pro Bowl for five straight seasons beginning in 2002 .
" From nearly the day he arrived in 2001 , Richard Seymour established himself as one of our premier players for nearly a decade , " Patriots coach Bill Belichick said Sunday .
" His presence has been felt as a force on the field , a respected man off it and a multiyear champion . "
The move is only the latest as the Patriots continue to get younger on defense .
Linebacker Mike Vrabel was traded to Kansas City in the offseason , safety Rodney Harrison retired , and more recently Tedy Bruschi officially called it a career after 13 seasons .
Seymour was the last member of the 2001 Super Bowl championship defense still with New England .
Earlier this summer , Oakland sent two - time Pro Bowl defensive end Derrick Burgess to New England for a pair of mid-round draft picks .
The Patriots also acquired receiver Randy Moss from Oakland in 2007 for a fourth - round pick , and the teams have swapped draft picks in recent years .
" Any transaction we make is with the goal of what is best for our team and , as difficult as it is to part ways with a player of Richard 's stature , many factors were taken into account when we considered this trade , " Belichick said .

state rep dodges new sales tax on liquor Tuesday , September 1 , 2009
We just received this photo and report from a member .
He left the observer / photographer anonymous by request .
So which state representative drives the below Ford with Massachusetts license plate House 29 ?
Will he be paying the Massachusetts use tax on all that booze he bought ?
I 'll bet he will now . . . since being caught red-handed .
Has there ever been a better poster child for " Do as I say , not as I do " ?
Who is this tax - evader -- and how stupid can he be ?
Chip Ford
It has come to our attention that the state rep who owns the car in the photo below ,
Massachusetts license plate House 29 , is : Rep. Michael J. Rodrigues ( D - Westport )
Joint Committee on Public Service , Vice - Chair
House Committee on Ways and Means
Joint Committee on Housing I wonder if these photos will appear on his website . . .
[ Website link updated with his election to the state Senate ]
As my family and I were driving back from York Beach my wife asked me to pull off at the NH liquor store on 95 south at the Mass border .
When I pulled around to get a parking space you can imagine my surprise to see what I could only assume to be a Mass state rep 's car .
He also had a Deval Patrick / Tim Murray sticker on his back window - so I assume he 's a democrat who voted in favor of the recent sales tax hike .
So the guy comes out with a couple of cases of booze in his carriage and loads them into his car .
I asked him if this was " official " business or personal .
He was surprised by my questioning and asked what business is it of mine as to what he 's doing .
I told him I was a Mass citizen .
He said it was personal - I pointed out the state car with official plates and he said it was " his " .
I did n't ask him WHY he was in NH purchasing alcohol instead of supporting Mass businesses and the 6.25 % tax they just levied on us common folk ...
He had his wife with him .
I left ahead of him and as I was driving down 95 into Mass doing the speed limit , he blew by me doing about 75 in the left lane .
I guess those who pass the laws need not abide by them .
You would think that after hours of testimony from Mass businesses saying how the increased tax and the alcohol tax would hurt them by causing people go to NH would have had an effect on these weasels .
But , alas , it 's proof again that they have no conscience and only serve their own interests and themselves .
So , who was this guy ?
I did n't even want to make him feel good or important by asking .
He asked where I was from and I did n't answer him .
I got into my car and drove away .

One more nail in the coffin of incumbency
Report : China top 500 firms perform better than US '
( Xinhua )
Updated : 2009-09-06 10:37
HANGZHOU : Profits of the top 500 enterprises in China exceeded that of their counterparts in the United States , a domestic ranking report said Saturday .
Net profits of the Chinese companies are $ 170.6 billion in the first half of this year , while the figure for the US companies are $ 98.9 billion , according to a report released by the China Enterprise Confederation ( CEC ) and China Enterprise Directors Association .
Although the net profits for the Chinese heavyweights are down 12.4 percent from a year ago , it is still less than a 84.67 percent fall for the US companies , which see the worst decline in 55 years recorded by the US Fortune magazine .
Wang Jiming , vice president of CEC , said although the business data showed that the Chinese companies were less vulnerable to the global financial crisis than the US counterparts , it did not mean they have made substantial improvements in comprehensive competitive power .
He said Chinese enterprises enjoy relatively better policies and domestic market environment .
Chinese companies still lacked behind world 's leading enterprises in resource allocation , innovation , international presence , business model and corporate culture , he noted .
In Russia it is not only the future that is unpredictable ; often the past is equally in doubt .
One minute Leon Trotsky was a hero of the Revolution , the father of the Red Army and a strong contender to succeed Lenin ; the next minute he never existed .
Until the late 1980s , the 1917 Revolution was the pinnacle of human achievement ; suddenly in the 1990s it was seen as an utter failure .
And today again history in the region is turning into an ideological battlefield .
When the Red Army poured into the Baltic states at the end of the Second World War , it liberated them from Nazi tyranny – but from the perspective of the subsequent decades of Soviet domination , was it liberation or merely another invasion ?
The Russians , of course , have no doubt on the matter : for them it was an heroic national achievement .
But for the states which less than two decades ago managed to crawl out from under the Soviet boot , things are not so simple .
The Museum of the Occupation of Latvia , an imposing black box of a building in the heart of Riga , tells the story of Latvia 's time inside the Soviet Union .
The Soviet soldiers , glorified as heroes in Moscow , are portrayed as criminals and occupiers , no better than the Germans they defeated .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But now , slamming shut a stable door through which its former subject states long ago bolted , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered the creation of a body with the Orwellian title of the Commission to Counteract the Falsification of History to the Detriment of Russian Interests .
A linked law is also likely to be passed that will outlaw the " rehabilitation of Nazism " on the territory of former Soviet republics .
Pressure to stop their much smaller neighbours telling recent history the way they see it has been building for some time .
When authorities in Estonia removed a monument to Soviet soldiers from the centre of Tallinn two years ago , riots between police and ethnic Russian citizens of Estonia ensued , and the Kremlin made furious noises .
With its new commission and law , Moscow is upping the stakes .
Russia accuses the governments of Estonia and Latvia of glorifying partisan regiments which fought on the side of the Nazis .
In recent years , relations between Latvia and Russia have normalised in many spheres , but the Second World War is still a thorny issue .
" The one issue which divides us is our interpretation of history , " says Ojars Kalnins , director of the Latvian Institute , a think - tank linked to Latvia 's Foreign Ministry .
" Russia could demonstrate a lot to the world if it did what Germany did , and apologised for the actions of previous governments . "
Apologising , however , is the last thing the Kremlin plans to do , and the new commission and law suggest that Russia is moving in the opposite direction , seeking to glorify the Soviet past and silence critics of Soviet communism .
The commission , say critics inside Russia , smacks of a Soviet attitude to history , and the most worrying aspect to be inferred from its bizarre title is that falsifying history in Russia 's interests is quite acceptable .
Last week , a scandal erupted over an article written by a Russian military historian that was posted on the website of the Russian Defence Ministry , blaming Poland for starting the Second World War .
The article absolved the Soviet Union from any role in contributing to the start of war , and instead blamed Poland for not acceding to " reasonable " demands from Nazi Germany .
The paper was removed after an official complaint from Poland .
A key pillar of Vladimir Putin 's eight - year presidency involved exhorting Russians to feel proud of their history , and he once said that foreign countries should never be able to make Russia feel guilty for its Soviet past .
The public appears to agree .
A recent survey by a leading Russian polling agency showed that 77 per cent of Russians consider the Red Army to have liberated eastern European countries and given them the chance to develop , while only 11 per cent felt that there was an occupation .
" Those trying to turn everything upside down and portray the Nazi liberator states as invaders have to suffer punishment , " said Valery Ryazansky , a member of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party and one of the law 's sponsors .
The Russians remain determined to stem the tide of what they see as anti-Russian propaganda .
" Such attempts are becoming more hostile , more evil , and more aggressive , " said Mr Medvedev in his online video blog last month .
" We must fight for the historical truth . "
1869 : Mary Mallon is born .
She might have passed out of this life as just another obscure Irish immigrant in New York , if not for unwittingly contracting typhoid fever and passing it on , as a " healthy carrier , " to dozens of people .
So history remembers her infamously , if perhaps a little unfairly , as the dreaded Typhoid Mary .
Mallon was in her teens when she came to the United States , where she found work as a domestic servant .
By all accounts a talented cook , Mallon was employed in a succession of upper - class kitchens around New York state .
In the summer of 1906 , she was working for a Manhattan banker , Charles Henry Warren , who had taken a vacation rental with his family on Long Island .
In late August , one of the Warren daughters fell ill with typhoid fever .
She was joined , in quick succession , by her mother , two maids , a gardener and a second Warren daughter .
The owner of the summer home feared the loss of a cash cow if word got around that the place was a breeding ground for typhoid fever .
So he hired George Soper , a public health official with knowledge of the disease , to snoop around .
Although Mallon had already left the family 's employ , Soper soon latched onto her as the probable source .
As he investigated her employment history , Soper discovered that similar typhoid outbreaks had accompanied Mallon wherever she went as far back as 1900 .
When Soper tracked her down and tried to get her to provide urine and stool samples , Mallon denied that she was sick and told him in no uncertain terms to bugger off .
Her attitude is understandable in the context of the times : Mallon was not well - educated but even if she had been , the notion of a healthy carrier was not fully understood — even in the medical community .
All she knew was that she felt fine and exhibited no symptoms , and she objected to being fingered as the perpetrator .
When Soper approached her again , this time with a doctor in tow , Mallon once more declined to be tested .
But she had been tested , apparently of her own volition , by a reputable chemist who pronounced her disease - free .
This only made things murkier .
( It 's been suggested that she was in remission when the testing took place . )
Mallon felt persecuted , and she may have had good reason considering the class prejudice that existed then , which fueled the prevailing attitude that " dirty immigrants " were responsible for most epidemics .
Soper certainly patronized her , once even resorting to bribery , telling Mallon he would write a book about her and give her all the publishing royalties .
Mallon responded by locking herself in the bathroom and waiting until he left .
Soper turned to the New York City Health Department , which dispatched a female doctor to reason with Mallon .
When that did n't work , they came back with the cops .
She was examined and found to be a carrier of typhoid fever .
Before the city 's health inspector could order Mallon into quarantine , she escaped and made a spirited , if short - lived , bid for freedom .
Recaptured , she was sent to the quarantine hospital on North Brother Island ( between Queens and The Bronx ) , where she remained for three years .
She was isolated for much of the time , growing embittered and maybe a little crazy , too .
Mallon was released from quarantine in 1910 , after agreeing not to work in food preparation , and to take reasonable hygienic precautions to minimize risks to other people .
Unfortunately , she was never told exactly what hygienic precautions she should take .
She was also in full denial by this time , convinced that the authorities simply had it in for her .
Mallon worked for a time as a laundress , but found it both tedious and less lucrative than the position of cook .
So she changed her surname to " Brown " and returned to her old profession .
In 1915 she was working at New York 's Sloane Hospital for Women when 25 people became infected with typhoid fever .
One died .
The law moved in , and the jig was up .
Meanwhile , health officials let Mallon 's story slip to the press , which was pretty yellow in those days and ever - eager to take a good yarn and run with it .
It was the newspapers that hung the moniker " Typhoid Mary " on her , as they provided lurid " details " of her deliberately infecting her victims .
History has also judged Mallon harshly , for deliberately returning to a job where she knew she posed a danger to others .
Nevertheless , some historians point to mitigating circumstances that make this more than a simple black - and - white story .
In custody once more , Mallon was returned to North Brother Island , where she remained in quarantine for the rest of her life .
She died in 1938 , not from typhoid fever but pneumonia .

The Home Office has appointed an ID Commissioner to oversee and monitor the roll - out of national ID cards .
Sir Joseph Pilling has previous form as permanent secretary to the Northern Ireland Office between 1997 and 2005 , reviewing senior jobs at the Church of England and the Civil Aviation Authority .
He has been at the Home Office since 1966 apart from a two - year sabbatical .
He is also on the board of Macmillan Cancer Support .
Pilling said : “ I am delighted to accept this post , and plan to be an independent voice in my work towards safeguarding the public ’s privacy and identity rights , as Parliament intended .
“ In the early weeks and months as I work out how best to do the job I intend to listen to the people across the National Identity Service and to people outside the system with views about my new role . ”
He will start his job on 1 October 2009 - in time for the lucky people of Manchester to get their hands on ID cards .
Cards which have already been given out to foreign nationals are not Pilling 's responsibility - they are overseen by the Information Commissioner and the UK Border Agency . ®
( CNN ) -- U.S. special operations forces raid in Somalia on Monday may have killed a wanted al Qaeda terrorist , U.S. officials said .
The FBI has this photo of Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan on its Web site .
The U.S. unit used a helicopter to fire on a car in southern Somalia , killing several people , including one the U.S. military believes was Saleh ali Saleh Nabhan , a senior al Qaeda operative .
Nabhan has been tied to several attacks in East Africa , including the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , according to the sources .
He also was wanted by the FBI for questioning in connection with the 2002 suicide bombing of an Israeli - owned hotel and the unsuccessful attack on an Israeli charter jet in Mombasa , Kenya .
The officials who talked to CNN are familiar with the latest information on this incident but did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media .
The helicopter flew from a U.S. Navy warship offshore , one of the sources said .
The ship kept watch on the operation and was ready to rescue the U.S. troops if they got into trouble .
The official said the troops landed to take away the body believed to be that of Nabhan for positive identification .
The United States had intelligence that he was in the area , and was monitoring the situation for several days , the sources said .
President Obama signed off on the operation , a senior U.S. official told CNN's Ed Henry .
Farmers in the southeastern town of Barawe , Somalia , who said they witnessed the assault , said a number of helicopters attacked a car and its occupants and that at least two people died .
They said some helicopters landed and that some of the injured or dead were pulled into at least one helicopter .
Farahan Ali Mohamoud , minister of disarmament for Somalia 's transitional federal government , confirmed to CNN that there was an attack in Barawe .

And although Turlington began modeling when she was just 14 , she returned to school and earned a B.A. in Comparative Religion and Eastern Philosophy from NYU .
At 40 years old , Turlington is again pursuing a degree , studying to earn her Master of Public Health from Columbia .
Lily Cole : English model and actress Lily Cole has appeared in Italian Vogue , Numero , French Playboy and other top fashion magazines , and has appeared in campaigns and walked the runway for designers like Chanel , John Galliano , Christian Lacroix , Rimmel and more .
In 2004 , she was named Model of the Year at the British Fashion Awards , and the kewpie - faced redhead also has roles in upcoming films Phantasmagoria : The Visions of Lewis Carroll and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus .
Cole was also accepted to King 's College Cambridge , though she deferred twice to concentrate on modeling before settling down .
Sasha Pivovarova : Russian model Sasha Pivovarova , at 24 , is already a veteran top model .
Pivovarova is known for her steely eyes and razor sharp cheekbones , and for six years she was the face of Prada .
Pivovarova has also walked for and starred in campaigns for Chanel , Louis Vuitton , Valentino , and virtually every other designer .
Pivovarova , a favorite of Vogue and Harper 's Bazaar photographers and editors , is also an artist who has hosted her own exhibit in New York City .
Prior to becoming a model , Pivovarova studied art at the St. Petersburg art institute .
Cindy Crawford : Cindy Crawford is an American icon and arguably one of the most famous models in the world .
In the 1990s , Crawford modeled for Versace , Revlon , Clairol , Maybelline , Pepsi and appeared on countless magazine covers from Sports Illustrated to Vogue .
Crawford is also credited as changing the image of the all - American girl from a saccharine blonde to a sexier , curvier , more powerful brunette .
Crawford studied chemical engineering at Northwestern University before dropping out to pursue modeling .
Iman : Somali model Iman is also a globally recognized celebrity , the wife of David Bowie , and a fashion icon .
Born in 1955 , Iman helped open the door to black and minority women who wanted to enter the modeling industry .
In addition to her experience in fashion , Iman studied political science at the University of Nairobi and speaks five languages .
Brooke Shields : Brooke Shields is known today for her acting work in films and on TV , but Shields has been in the industry since she was just 11 months old , when she began working as a model .
Shields was signed with Eileen Ford , who claims she started a child modeling branch of her agency just so that she could work with Shields .
Over the next several years , Shields began appearing on magazine covers including Vogue and starred in a then - controversial Calvin Klein ad campaign when she was just a teenager .
Shields graduated from modeling to film and TV work , but she took a break during the 1980s to attend Princeton University , from which she earned a degree in French literature .
Rebecca Romijn : Rebecca Romijn enjoyed a successful career as a blonde bombshell and supermodel , appearing in Sports Illustrated and Maxim , and working as a top Victoria 's Secret model .

Romijn then began to focus her career on acting , appearing in movies like X - Men and on the popular ABC comedy Ugly Betty .
But before her big break , Romijn studied music and voice at the University of California , Santa Cruz .
Left 4 Dead 2 Boycott Leaders Flown to Valve
The two boycotters ( shown left , flanking Valve president Gabe Newell ) announced their playtest on the group 's Steam page , reporting that Left 4 Dead 2 " seemed balanced and ' tight ' and did not feel like a rushed job . "
" What we can say with confidence is that the quality of gameplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is not in question ; and it will only get better , " they said following the visit , while adding that they will not give up the boycott until their " individual concerns are addressed . "
The group 's official charter demands that Valve release ongoing DLC for the original Left 4 Dead , convert Left 4 Dead 2 to a free update or an expansion , and give discounts for the sequel to Left 4 Dead owners .
Despite the duo's assurance that the boycott is not over , some members took the largely complimentary report to mean that the group had been " corrupted " by Valve .
" The boycott points still stand and you guys seem to be brainwashed by Valve , " said Steam user $ paqhett !e!s .
" Boycotters need another group . "
Other users were impressed with Valve 's gesture , or simply impressed with Valve 's trophy .
" That is an awesome trophey [ sic ] , " said user -=RAWR = - DaNNaZ .
" Who was that guy in the middle ? "

A new study using brain imaging to study teen behavior indicates that adolescents who engage in dangerous activities have frontal white matter tracts that are more adult in form than their more conservative peers .
The brain goes through a course of maturation during adolescence and does not reach its adult form until the mid-twenties .
A long - standing theory of adolescent behavior has assumed that this delayed brain maturation is the cause of impulsive and dangerous decisions in adolescence .
The new study , using a new form of brain imaging , calls into question this theory .
In order to better understand the relationship between high risk - taking and the brain 's development , Emory University and Emory School of Medicine neuroscientists used a form of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) called diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) to measure structural changes in white matter in the brain .
The study 's findings are published in the Aug. 26 , 2009 PLoS ONE .
" In the past , studies have focused on the pattern of gray matter density from childhood to early adulthood , says Gregory Berns , MD , PhD , principal investigator and professor of Psychiatry and Neuroeconomics at Emory University and director of the Center for Neuropolicy .
" With new technology , we were able to develop the first study looking at how development of white matter relates to activities in the real world . "
Gray matter is the part of the brain made up of neurons , while white matter connects neurons to each other .
As the brain matures , white matter becomes denser and more organized .
Gray matter and white matter follow different trajectories .
Both are important for understanding brain function .
The study enrolled 91 adolescents ages 12 through 18 over a three - year period .
Levels of engagement in dangerous behaviors were measured by a survey that included questions about the teens ' thrill seeking behaviors , reckless behaviors , rebellious behaviors and antisocial behaviors .
DTI was used to measure corresponding structural changes in white matter .
" We were surprised to discover that risk - taking was associated with more highly - developed white matter - a more mature brain , " says Berns .
" We were also surprised to learn that except for slightly higher scores in risk - taking , there was no significant difference in the maturity of the white matter between males and females . "
Berns suggests that doing adult - like activities requires sophisticated skills .
" Society is a lot different now than it was 100 years ago when teens were expected to go to work and raise a family , " says Berns .
" Now , adolescents are n't expected to act like adults until they are in their twenties , when they have finished their education and found a career .
" You could make the case that in this country , biological capacity shows up long before the wisdom that comes with time is fully developed , " notes Berns .
Berns says more studies need to be done to determine if early brain development predisposes someone to engage in risky behaviors , or if the risky behavior drives the maturation of the brain .
The CDC reports that , 27,000 people between the ages of 10 and 24 die from bad decisions in the United States per year .
Additionally , it has been shown that the period of mid-adolescence ( ages 15 through 19 ) is the time when teens are more likely to begin high - risk behaviors such as drinking , abusing drugs or driving recklessly .

Introduction
Stuart Halloway recently posted a series of articles collectively entitled Java.next , discussing some of the newer languages that compile to Java Virtual Machine bytecode ( Clojure , Groovy , JRuby and Scala ) and how they encourage a cleaner and more concise , as well as somewhat functional , programming style .
I thought I ’d take the opportunity here to write a parallel series of articles comparing Haskell with the above languages , much in the way that Hamlet D’Arcy did with F# .
You ’ll want to read Halloway ’s article first , if you have n’t already ; while I repeat the code examples for comparison , I do n’t repeat his explanations .
I call this series “ succ Java ” not because I think that Java sucks ( though I rather think it does ) , but because succ is the function that produces the successor to a value : succ 0 = 1 , and for me Haskell has been the successor to both Java and Ruby .
I ’ll be pointing out not only the similarities between Haskell and these other languages , and demonstrating the cleaner syntax , but also discussing some of the differences and why I think that these make Haskell a better language than any of the above .
So let ’s start in on the first column , discussing mainly some of the similarities these languages share in having powerful features beyond Java .
Everything is an object .
Well , this is true for the JVM languages , of course , but not for Haskell , where everything is data and functions .
Still , aside from some slight differences in name space management , this is not as a big a difference as it seems ;
Haskell offers other features , such as type classes , that give it equivalent ( or better ) power and convenience .
Let ’s look at the examples given in Halloway ’s article :
C : (. 1 floatValue ) ; clojure G : 1.floatValue ( ) // groovy R : 1.to_f # ruby S : 1.floatValue // scala
Haskell is pretty similar :
H : fromIntegral 3 :: Double -- Haskell
The only real difference we see here is that rather than using a function that specifies what we want to convert the number to , we the function specifies what it should be converted from , and use a type declaration to specify what we ’d like to convert it to .
fromIntegral is actually a polymorphic function with many different versions ; we ’ll have more to say about this in part three of this series .
But there ’s another difference going on underneath .
Data values in Haskell are normally “ boxed , ” meaning that they contain additional information beyond the value itself , such as whether this is a fully evaluated value or a “ thunk , ” a piece of not - yet - executed code that will evaluate to this value when run .
However , the compiler has available to it unboxed values as well , such as standard 32 - and 64 - bit integer and floating point numbers , and understands the equivalences between the boxed and unboxed versions of these values .
This allows it to optimize the code by using unboxed versions when appropriate , such as when storing arrays of values .
In particular , it can also pass values in registers when free registers are available , avoiding expensive access to memory .
Note that unboxed values cannot include type information ; the compiler is required to keep track of the types of various values and generate code that will never do the wrong thing .
That it can safely do this , rather than having to do type checks at runtime , is one of the great advantages of having a good type system like Haskell’s .
Low - ceremony property definitions
Composite data items , accessors , and the like exist in Haskell just as they do in object - oriented languages :
C : ( defstruct person : first - name : last - name ) G : class Person { def firstName ; def lastName ; } R : Person = Struct.new ( : first_name , : last_name ) S : case class Person ( firstName : String , lastName : String ) {} H : data Person = Person { lastName , firstName :: String }
What we ’ve done here is defined a type named Person .
( Types in Haskell always start with an upper - case letter ) .
It has a value constructor , also Person , which can be used as a function that , given two parameters of type String will construct and return a new value of type Person .
It ’s safe to use the same name because type and value names live in different namespaces , and due to the syntax of the language cannot be confused .
We also define two accessors / setters , lastName and firstName .
These allow all of the usual operations :
p1 = Person " Smith " " Joe " -- Create a new person p2 = Person { firstName = " Jane " --
And again , with explicit , lastName = " Doe " -- specification of the field } -- names .
p3 = p2 { firstName = " Amy " } -- Another new person : Amy Doe. lastName p2 == lastName p3 -- Evaluates to True .
You ’ll note that function calls in Haskell do not use parentheses ( which are optional in Ruby , as well ) , and also separate their arguments with spaces , not commas .
Parentheses in Haskell are used only to control evaluation order , such as in ( 2+3 ) * 6 .
You might wonder why I reverse the last name and first name from the example in Halloway ’s article .
This is so that , should I derive Ord for it , it will compare and sort by lastName first , then by firstName after that , since the automatic derivation of the comparision function compares the fields in the order they were declared .
Let me explain further .
Haskell has “ type classes ” that serve a role similar to that of interfaces in Java : any type that ’s a member ( or “ instance ” ) of a given type class has implementations of the functions associated with that type class .
So , for example , the String type being a member of the Eq class means that one may apply the functions ( == ) and ( /= ) ( equal and not equal ) to pairs of string arguments and get back the appropriate boolean result .
The type class
Ord offers ordering - related functions , such as ( <) , ( < = ) , sort , and so on .
Unlike interfaces in Java , though , a Haskell compiler understands certain common type classes and their functions , and is capable of automatically generating the code for these when it ’s “ obvious ” how to do this based on the data declaration .
For Ord , it does comparisions in the order of the declaration of the fields , so that if I add deriving ( Eq , Ord ) to the end of the Person data declaration , applying the sort function to a list of Person values will sort them by lastName then firstName .
This offers much of the power of inheritance or Ruby ’s mixins with less work .
I wo n’t go into this too deeply in this post , however ; I encourage you to consult a Haskell tutorial if you ’re interested in pursuing this further .
Expressive collections
All of the examples given in Halloway ’s article are quite functional in style and so , Haskell being a truly functional language , is quite similar :
C : ( filter ( fn [ x ] ( = 1 ( rem x 2 ) ) ) ( map ( fn [ x ] (* x x ) ) ( range 10 ) ) ) G : ( 1..10 ) .collect{ it * it }.findAll { it %2 == 1} R : ( 1..10 ) .collect{ |x| x*x }.select { |x| x%2 == 1} S : ( 1 to 10 ) .map( x => x*x ) .filter(x => x %2 == 1 ) H : filter odd ( map ( ^2 ) [ 1..10 ] )
We can see here already how Haskell ’s minimal syntax and avoidance of punctuation produces particularly clean and readable code .
I think that Haskell has some of the nicest syntax of any general purpose language out there because of this .
One point here : we ’ve now encountered a commonly used technique in Haskell called “ partial application , ” where you give a function only some of its arguments to produce a new function taking the remaining ones .
Where ( 3^2 ) evaluates to a simple value , 9 , ( ^2 ) evaluates to a function that takes one parameter , the one that normally goes on the left side of the carat : this function can then be applied to a value to produce the final result .
square = ( ^2 ) square 3 -- evaluates to 9 square 4 -- evaluates to 16
This is a convenient way of avoiding the extra syntax of an explicit lambda definition ( declaring a function with no name ) , such as square = \x -> ( x ^ 2 ) .
Compare the brevity and clarity :
map ( \x -> x ^ 2 ) [ 1..10 ] map ( ^2 ) [ 1..10 ]
Haskell offers an alternative way of expressing the filter / map expression above using a list comprehension , which Python users will be familiar with ( Python ’s list comprehensions were taken from Haskell ) :
[ x ^2 | x <- [ 1..10 ] , odd ( x ^ 2 ) ]
This reads , the list of x2 where x is taken from the list [ 1..10 ] and only the values where x2 is odd are kept .
Functional programming
Haskell of course has first class functions and various ways of defining functions “ on the fly , ” as it were .
The other languages all use explicitly named function definitions or , at best , lambdas :
C : ( defn adder [ x ] ( fn [ y ] (+ x y ) ) )
G : adder = { add -> { val -> val + add } } R : def adder ( add ) lambda { |x| x + add } ; end S : def sum( a : Int ) ( b : Int ) = a + b
As we ’ve seen above , we have lambdas in Haskell as well , can declare functions with explicit parameters in the normal way , and also use our partial application style ( which is often referred to as “ point free ” style ) :
H : adderLambda = \x y -> x + y H : adderDefinition x y = x + y H : adderPointFree = (+)
In this particular example we touch again on the polymorphism given to us by the type class system in Haskell : despite being statically type checked at compile time , the above Haskell definitions are all equivalent to the dynamic definitions in languages such as Ruby , though we ’re actually declaring many instances of the adderPointFree function .
Because (+ ) is a polymorphic function that works on any type in the “ class ” ( or set ) of types called Num , adderPointFree will automatically also do so , unless we explicitly specify otherwise .
The type signature is , in this case :
(+ ) :: Num a => a -> a -> a
which says that (+ ) takes two values of type a and returns a third value also of type a , where a stands for any type that is in the Num class .
Overriding operators
Here , Haskell is the same as nearly everybody else , all of whom can overload operators to avoid the separate function names required in Java :
J : balance.add(balance.multiply ( interest ) ) ; // Java math C : (+ balance (* balance interest ) ) G : balance + ( balance * interest ) R : balance + ( balance * interest ) S : balance + ( balance * interest ) H : balance + ( balance * interest )
Again , this is Haskell ’s type class system at work .
Maintainable exception handling
Haskell , as with the other languages , has no checked exceptions .
However , Haskell has one additional feature that JVM languages do not : the dreaded Null Pointer Exception has been banished !
Tony Hoare referred to his invention of the null reference in 1965 as his “ Billion Dollar Mistake ” ; it ’s caused no small number of bugs and amount of boilerplate code , because everybody now has to deal with an extra , odd value everywhere .
In Haskell , on the other hand , there are no null references , though there are simple mechanisms to do something similar in areas where they are useful in other languages .
This is unfortunately something that ’s just not fixable in Java or the JVM without major reworking that would either break backward compatibility for a huge amount of code .
Adding methods to existing types
Haskell has no objects , just functions and values .
So , unlike OO programmers , when we need a new function we simply write a new function and we ’re done with it .
This turns out to be rather more convenient than it sounds to an OO programmer , actually .
Skipping over the 12 line Java example , let ’s look at how we add this new is Blank method in the languages that Halloway demonstrates .
In Groovy :
String.metaClass.isBlank = { length ( ) == 0 || every { Character.isWhitespace(it.charAt(0 ) ) } }
In Ruby :
class String def blank ?
empty ? || strip.empty ?
end end
In Clojure :
( defmulti blank ?
class ) ( defmethod blank ?
String [ s ] ( every ? # {\space} s ) ) ( defmethod blank ? nil [ _ ] true )
( Note in this Clojure example the extra check for a null reference ; apparently the author believes that null is the same as an empty string .
Whether it should be or not is open to interpretation . )
In Scala :
class CharWrapper(ch : Char ) { def is Whitespace = Character.isWhitespace(ch ) } implicit def charWrapper ( ch : Character ) = new CharWrapper ( ch ) class BlankWrapper(s : String ) { def isBlank = s.isEmpty || s.forall ( ch => ch.isWhitespace ) } implicit def stringWrapper(s : String ) = new BlankWrapper(s )
And in Haskell ?
isBlank = all isSpace
It does n’t get much cleaner and simpler than that !
Type classes in Haskell are not extensible , at least not without recompiling everything declared to be of that type class .
There ’s good reason for this : since the type safety of a function call is checked at compile time , if we allowed run-time changes at the type level , the program could crash when linked with another module that did n’t know about these changes .
This is the price we pay for efficiency .
( There are actually ways in Haskell of dealing with types at runtime , if you ’re willing to pay the price of doing all of the checks at runtime , but I wo n’t get into those here . )
Roll - your - own constructs
Haskell offers particularly powerful abilities to add new things that would normally be language features in other languages .
Monads , in particular , are used not only to keep track of state but also for control flow .
This allows you to add new control - flow structures as libraries .
I wo n’t get into all of the details of this here , as it can get complex , but it ’s all there .
And of course you can do all of the usual things with first - class functions that you can do in any functional language .
A Note on Tail Call Optimization
In the comments on Hamlet D’Arcy ’s blog entry on F# there ’s a discussion of the JVM ’s lack of tail call optimization .
Though this can be mitigated to a limited extent ( which Scala does ) , this can in some circumstances be detrimental when using a functional programming style , for example , when you ’re iterating over a large data structure using mutually recursive functions .
I would take Jon Harrop ( commenting there as “ Flying Frog Consultancy ” ) with a grain of salt though ; there are plenty of cases where this is n’t a critical issue , and even if you ’re careful to avoid iterating with tail calls altogether , that still leaves you with plenty of good functional programing techniques to improve your code .
Summary
So there ’s where Haskell lies in relation to Clojure , Groovy , JRuby and Scala as discussed in Halloway ’s article , and I think it comes out very , very well .
This has only touched on Haskell ’s many capabilities and strengths , of course .
There ’s more to come in future articles , but I encourage you to spend some time with Haskell yourself , if you find what I ’ve said here interesting .
Did you illegally download a cracked version of Arkham Asylum for the PC ?
Hope you enjoy playing with a Batman who has conveniently forgotten some of his moveset , rendering the game unbeatable .
Do you know what I love ?
Creative DRM .
Any developer can throw in a mandated online check , or give you a limited number of installs , or something boring like that , but then you have developers with a cruel sense of humor who make it so that pirates have their genitals attacked by ill - tempered ferrets , and the ferrets are on fire .
That 's going above the call of duty right there .
Apparently , one of said developers is Rocksteady Studios , creators of critical darling Batman : Arkham Asylum .
Pirates who have illegally acquired the PC version of the game will find themselves playing the game with a Batman who has apparently forgotten how to use his moves , notably the glide - jump .
In an amusing little thread on the Eidos forums , one pirate came to innocently report a bug , claiming that instead of gliding when the appropriate input was given , the Dark Knight would instead just spread his wings and fall to his death in poison gas .
Quoth an Eidos admin in response :
The problem you have encountered is a hook in the copy protection , to catch out people who try and download cracked versions of the game for free .
It 's not a bug in the game 's code , it 's a bug in your moral code .
Since its acquisition of Rocksteady parent Eidos , Square - Enix has announced plans to use similar DRM in its upcoming Final Fantasy XIII , where any attempt to use magic will always result in summoning a rampaging horde of Chocobos to crush the party , the player , and anyone they 've ever loved .
Jesus , people !
What the HELL ?!!!
Do you realize how difficult it is going to be for me to retain any sort of objectivity on this one ?
Maybe it ’s all the hormones in the meat we eat and the mind - controlling fluoride in the water , but the people who are willing to entertain Charlie Sheen ’s opinion on ANYTHING are missing a lobe and a half of gelatinous mind milk .
This is MY opinion , as are all of these crazy columns I write .
Like I have said before , I sometimes even make up my opinion , change it ( I like short chicks today .
I met a cool one that was nice to me this very weekend . ) , and mush it around to try and make it entertaining .
I am trying to keep my composure , I really am .
1...2… 3… 4…5…6 … Serenity Prayer … Lord ’s Prayer ... Lorazepam …
Ok , what do we know about Charlie Sheen ?
He is theson of Martin Sheen , an actor who played a left - wing president in a thinly - veiled liberal love fest called “ The West Wing ” .
( Gossamer thin , folks . )
His brother , Emilio Estevez , also and actor , played a lovesick kid from Georgetown , a section of Washington , D.C. , in the 1980 ’s bratpackstravaganza , “ St. Elmo ’s Fire ” .
That ’s what gives him the authority to comment , authoritatively , on 9/11 !
Now I get it !
He has had Washington connections for YEARS !
He jumps to his cock - eyed conclusions based on a lineage of Kennedyesque political leadership , consuming Photo - shopped non-evidence faster than his ex-wife could click her divorce - paper - signing pen when she could n’t take his logic leaps anymore .
It was n’t anyalleged whoring and coking that cracked her composure , it was his incessant jumping on her head trying to stuff it with poop .
Is he the “ Half ” in “ Two and a Half Men ” ?
Does he raise his hand like Horshack in “ Welcome Back Kotter ” when he raises one of his amazing questions that a third grader with Stockholm Syndrome could have thought up after thirty hours straight of reprogramming “ therapy ” ?
He successfully raises the hair on the back of my neck , yes he does .
Every single one .
Someone had the balls to send me an email of the Alex Jones ( I am shuddering violently at the sight of that name ) interview of Charlie Sheen .
This guy makes money off your gullibility , folks .
He laughs at you while he sits on his golden toilet , flushing your trust down with the money rolls he uses for toilet paper .
In this economy !
I believe that if you believe what Charlie believes then you WANT to believe the conspiracy theories .
You WANT President Bush to have knocked down those towers because he looks like the snotty frat boy who tried to feel you up in the locker room and said that it does n’t make him gay .
Well , Bush may look like that guy , but he ’s not that gay .
( That guy ’s name is Tim and he is that gay . )
Bush was n’t even Bush .
You ’ll never know who the real Bush was .
He may have cloned himself and spent his whole presidency in Costa Rica sipping some green - apple Pucker concoction while his other self sat for portraits and kissed babies .
If you hate THAT guy , then you have missed the poetry ofGeorge W. Bush , the most liberal republican that a Hollywood demo could ask for .
( Look it up . )
He also KEPT US FROM GETTING ATTACKED AGAIN … and not because he supposedly did it in the first place .
In fact , if he did it once and it was so fun for him , why the hell did n’t he do it again ?
Before I make myself bulimic because of the poison that I have had to witness in order to write this piece , I have a list of questions for Charlie Sheen concerning this vomitous , tragic , mental fisting that he calls an opinion :
1 . What took your ass so long to make this idiotic leap of logic and come public with it ?
It ’s been EIGHT YEARS !
Does it take you that long to form a thought ?
2 . How do you know so much ?
Were you in on it ?
I want to investigate YOU since you know so much .
In fact , I think you are hiding more than you are saying .
You ’d have to be , since what you are actually saying amounts to a hill of turds .
3 . Have you seen the look in your eyes when you talk about this stuff ?
I think you ate the other half of that man in your show with fava beans and a nice Chianti .
4 . What would make you think that YOU , a movie actor , have the life experience and studying capabilities to back up such lofty allegations ?
5 . Why do you think it is alright to abuse your misplaced power to scare people into believing unproven crap like this ?
Did you ever consider the kid who might be a fan of your show that sees you spouting this pollution , you contributor to global warming , and cry himself to sleep because he thinks his own president killed thousands of people on his own soil ?
I ’m serious about this one .
No speculation here .
You should be ashamed , the way any evangelist who spouts fire and brimstone around children should .
You have done damage .
Not too hard to imagine that one .
Here ’s what I think happened on 9/11 : People died in a horrible event organized by people who hate the American way of life .
That includes you , Charlie Sheen .

It was a good week of redemption for me when it comes to selecting sleepers , with two of the three picks having solid days ( click here to read the column ) :
Jason Campbell – 27-41 , 340 yards , 2 TD , 1 INT
Chansi Stuckey – 2 receptions for 11 yards
Ricky Williams – 55 rushing yards and 1 TD ; 4 receptions for 29 yards
This week sleepers become a little bit more critical , with bye weeks playing a role for the first time in the season and injuries beginning to mount .
Let ’s take a look at a few gambles that may be worth taking depending on your format :
Kerry Collins – Tennessee Titans – vs. Jacksonville
Collins had actually been playing fairly well over the first two weeks of the season , throwing for 460 yards and 3 TD , while being intercepted twice .
That was before he ran into the New York Jets defense , which stymied him down the stretch to the tune of 13 consecutive incomplete passes .
He was held to 170 yards and picked off twice , but with the way that defense has been playing it really is nothing to be ashamed of .
This week he has a chance to get healthy , taking on the defense that has allowed the most passing yards per game in the early going ( 281.7 ) .
Yes , they have faced three potent QBs in Peyton Manning , Kurt Warner & Matt Schaub , but they still have clearly been porous .
It ’s unlikely to be a shootout , which could hurt his numbers slightly with Chris Johnson getting a chance to do some damage , but if you are in a two - quarterback league and are in need of a fill - in he seems poised for a solid game .

Nate Burleson – Seattle Seahawks – vs. Indianapolis
You have to figure that the Seahawks are going to have to take to the air a bit more in order to keep up with the Colts offense .
Last week with Seneca Wallace at the helm , Burleson exploded for 9 catches and 109 yards , bringing him to 20 catches on the young season .

" The Depression was the first time in the history of the U.S. that wages did not fall during a period of significant deflation . "
–UCLA economist Lee E. Ohanian
In America 's Great Depression , originally published in 1963 , Murray Rothbard argued that the recession - adjustment that began in 1929 was greatly worsened and turned into a full - blown depression by the policies implemented by Herbert Hoover .
Among the Hooverite policies that stifled the adjustment process , Rothbard identified public - works programs , increases in taxes , the imposition of the Smoot - Hawley tariff , but especially Hoover 's efforts to prevent the downward adjustment of nominal wages by exerting pressure on big industrialists not to cut ( and even to raise ) their employees ' wage rates .
Rothbard 's explanation of how the temporary and benign recession - adjustment process was impeded and diverted into the Great Depression ran counter to the view that Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz put forth in their classic work A Monetary History of the United States , 1867 –1960 , also published in 1963 .
According to Friedman - Schwartz , it was the collapse of the money supply due to the negligence of the Fed that turned what should have been a " garden - variety recession " into the Great Depression .
The Friedman - Schwartz view came to dominate mainstream macroeconomics after the collapse of the Keynesian consensus in the 1970s .
Indeed , it is today the conventional explanation of the Great Depression , which Bernanke holds to and which governs the policy response of the Fed to the current financial crisis .
Thus , for decades Rothbard and a handful of Misesian economists were virtually alone in maintaining that Hoover 's interventionist policies , particularly as they impacted the industrial labor market , were mainly responsible for transforming what should have been a short and sharp recession into the economic catastrophe of epic proportions that we now know as the " Great Depression . "
Now comes a National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) working paper written by a prominent macroeconomist with impeccable academic credentials — and accepted for publication by the influential Journal of Economic Theory — which challenges the Friedman - Schwartz view and lends ample evidence to the Rothbardian position on the genesis of the Great Depression .
In writing his article , " Who — or What — Started the Great Depression , " UCLA economist Lee E. Ohanian spent four years poring over wage data and culling information from sources related to Hoover and his administration .
In order to quantify the magnitude of the effects of Hoover 's industrial labor market program , Ohanian used these data and sources to construct and calculate a general - equilibrium model of the Hoover economy and compared it to how the model economy would have behaved without the Hoover program .
Ohanian contends that Hoover 's policy of propping up wages and encouraging work sharing " was the single most important event in precipitating the Great Depression " and resulted in " a significant labor market distortion . "
Thus , " the recession was three times worse — at a minimum — than it otherwise would have been , because of Hoover . "
The main reason is that in September 1931 nominal wage rates were 92 percent of their level two years earlier .
Since a significant price deflation had occurred during these two years , real wages rose by 10 percent during the same period , while gross domestic product ( GDP ) fell by 27 percent .
By contrast , during 1920 – 1921 — a period that was accompanied by a severe deflation — " some manufacturing wages fell by 30 percent .
GDP , meanwhile , only dropped by 4 percent . "
As Ohanian notes , " The Depression was the first time in the history of the US that wages did not fall during a period of significant deflation . "
Ohanian estimates that the severe labor - market disequilibrium induced by Hoover 's policies accounted for 18 percent of the 27 percent decline in the nation 's GDP by the fourth quarter of 1931 .
Regarding the now - conventional explanations of the Great Depression , such as widespread bank failures and the severe contraction of the money supply , Ohanian points out that these two events did not occur to a significant extent until mid-1931 , which was two years after the implementation of Hoover 's industrial labor market policies .
Moreover , Ohanian argues ,
any monetary explanation of the Depression requires a theory of very large and very protracted monetary nonneutrality .
Such a theory has been elusive because the Depression is so much larger than any other downturn , and because explaining the persistence of such a large nonneutrality requires in turn a theory for why the normal economic forces that ultimately undo monetary nonneutrality were grossly absent in this episode .
The conclusion of Ohanian 's paper is quite — one is tempted to say " hardcore " — Rothbardian .
The Great Depression that quickly superseded and distorted the benign recession - adjustment process was not in any sense caused by monetary deflation but by government - induced nominal wage rigidities , which of course can be temporarily circumvented by surreptitiously reducing real wages via unanticipated monetary expansion .
Thus writes Ohanian :
I conclude that the Depression is the consequence of government programs and policies , including those of Hoover , that increased labor 's ability to raise wages above their competitive levels .
The Depression would have been much less severe in the absence of Hoover 's program .
Similarly , given Hoover 's program , the Depression would have been much less severe if monetary policy had responded to keep the price level from falling , which raised real wages .
This analysis also provides a theory for why low nominal spending — what some economists refer to as deficient aggregate demand — generated such a large depression in the 1930s , but not in the early 1920s , which was a period of comparable deflation and monetary contraction , but when firms cut nominal wages considerably .
The Pros and Cons of Password Masking
Usability guru Jakob Nielsen opened up a can of worms when he made the case for unmasking passwords in his blog .
I chimed in that I agreed .
Almost 165 comments on my blog ( and several articles , essays , and many other blog posts ) later , the consensus is that we were wrong .
I was certainly too glib .
Like any security countermeasure , password masking has value .
But like any countermeasure , password masking is not a panacea .
And the costs of password masking need to be balanced with the benefits .
The cost is accuracy .
When users do n’t get visual feedback from what they ’re typing , they ’re more prone to make mistakes .
This is especially true with character strings that have non-standard characters and capitalization .
This has several ancillary costs :
Users get pissed off .
Users are more likely to choose easy - to - type passwords , reducing both mistakes and security .
Removing password masking will make people more comfortable with complicated passwords : they ’ll become easier to memorize and easier to use .
The benefits of password masking are more obvious :
Security from shoulder surfing .
If people ca n’t look over your shoulder and see what you ’re typing , they ’re much less likely to be able to steal your password .
Yes , they can look at your fingers instead , but that ’s much harder than looking at the screen .
Surveillance cameras are also an issue : it ’s easier to watch someone ’s fingers on recorded video , but reading a cleartext password off a screen is trivial .
In some situations , there is a trust dynamic involved .
Do you type your password while your boss is standing over your shoulder watching ?
How about your spouse or partner ?
Your parent or child ?
Your teacher or students ?
At ATMs , there ’s a social convention of standing away from someone using the machine , but that convention does n’t apply to computers .
You might not trust the person standing next to you enough to let him see your password , but do n’t feel comfortable telling him to look away .
Password masking solves that social awkwardness .
harder than looking at the screen .
Surveillance cameras are also an issue : it ’s easier to watch someone ’s fingers on recorded video , but reading a cleartext password off a screen is trivial .
Security from screen scraping malware .
This is less of an issue ; keyboard loggers are more common and unaffected by password masking .
And if you have that kind of malware on your computer , you ’ve got all sorts of problems .
A security “ signal . ”
Password masking alerts users , and I ’m thinking users who are n’t particularly security savvy , that passwords are a secret .
I believe that shoulder surfing is n’t nearly the problem it ’s made out to be .
One , lots of people use their computers in private , with no one looking over their shoulders .
Two , personal handheld devices are used very close to the body , making shoulder surfing all that much harder .
Three , it ’s hard to quickly and accurately memorize a random non-alphanumeric string that flashes on the screen for a second or so .
This is not to say that shoulder surfing is n’t a threat .
It is .
And , as many readers pointed out , password masking is one of the reasons it is n’t more of a threat .
And the threat is greater for those who are not fluent computer users : slow typists and people who are likely to choose bad passwords .
But I believe that the risks are overstated .
Password masking is definitely important on public terminals with short PINs .
( I ’m thinking of ATMs . )
The value of the PIN is large , shoulder surfing is more common , and a four - digit PIN is easy to remember in any case .
And lastly , this problem largely disappears on the Internet on your personal computer .
Most browsers include the ability to save and then automatically populate password fields , making the usability problem go away at the expense of another security problem ( the security of the password becomes the security of the computer ) .
There ’s a Firefox plugin that gets rid of password masking .
And programs like my own Password Safe allow passwords to be cut and pasted into applications , also eliminating the usability problem .
One approach is to make it a configurable option .
High - risk banking applications could turn password masking on by default ; other applications could turn it off by default .
Browsers in public locations could turn it on by default .
I like this , but it complicates the user interface .
A reader mentioned BlackBerry ’s solution , which is to display each character briefly before masking it ; that seems like an excellent compromise .
I , for one , would like the option .
I cannot type complicated WEP keys into Windows — twice !
what ’s the deal with that ?
— without making mistakes .
I cannot type my rarely used and very complicated PGP keys without making a mistake unless I turn off password masking .
That ’s what I was reacting to when I said “ I agree . ”
So was I wrong ?
Maybe .
Okay , probably .
Password masking definitely improves security ; many readers pointed out that they regularly use their computer in crowded environments , and rely on password masking to protect their passwords .
On the other hand , password masking reduces accuracy and makes it less likely that users will choose secure and hard - to - remember passwords , I will concede that the password masking trade - off is more beneficial than I thought in my snap reaction , but also that the answer is not nearly as obvious as we have historically assumed .

SAN FRANCISCO --
A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced Silicon Valley financier William " Boots " Del Biaggio III to more than eight years in prison for bilking investors and banks -- including one he helped launch -- out of millions of dollars in a desperate attempt to buy a pro hockey team .
The disgraced scion of a prominent San Jose family is to report to prison in January , capping a long fall for a former high roller who counted hockey great Mario Lemieux as a golfing buddy and who jetted on private planes to Las Vegas , where he amassed a $ 4 million gambling debt .
Del Biaggio pleaded guilty to one charge of forging financial documents to obtain $ 110 million in loans from several banks and two NHL owners -- Craig Leopold of the Minnesota Wild and Los Angeles Kings owner AEG .
Del Biaggio used the money to purchase a controlling interest in the Nashville Predators .
Del Biaggio set his crime in motion by turning to David Cacchione , a financially strapped stockbroker at Merriman Curhan Ford Group Inc. who owed him $ 2 million .
According to federal prosecutors and the SEC , Cacchione e-mailed Del Biaggio account statements from several wealthy Merriman clients showing tens of millions of dollars worth of stock holdings .
Del Biaggio then doctored the account statements by cutting out the clients ' names and pasting in his own and presenting them to the banks and NHL owners as collateral .
Auditors examining Merriman 's books uncovered the fraud last year .
Cacchione has pleaded guilty to one fraud charge and is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 29 .
Henry Tang , Merriman 's chief financial officer , on Tuesday told U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer that the scam cost the San Francisco - based company $ 10 million in legal fees and forced it reduce its staff from 188 employees to 85 .
Tang said the publicly traded company 's share price has tumbled because of Del Biaggio 's action , wiping out $ 43.4 million in market capitalization .
Breyer ordered Del Biaggio to pay back eight banks and the two NHL owners a combined $ 47.5 million .
One of the victim banks is Heritage Bank of Commerce , which Del Biaggio co-founded with his father nearly 20 years ago .
The judge ordered Del Biaggio to pay the bank $ 4.8 million .
Besides the fraudulent loans , the Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a lawsuit seeking to recover roughly $ 20 million of individual investments the agency accuses Del Biaggio of spending on personal expenses .
Three of those investors on Tuesday urged the judge to mete out a lengthy prison sentence , complaining that Del Biaggio squandered their retirement funds and children 's education nest eggs .
Several other victims , including childhood friends and longtime business associates , wrote the court with similar sentiments .
Although those losses were n't included in the indictment , Breyer still ordered Del Biaggio to also pay back those victims .
In all , Del Biaggio has to repay a total of $ 67.4 million .
" A betrayal of trust is an awful thing , " Breyer said .
" I do n't care if you can pay back everything -- this will never leave you and that 's the real punishment here . "
Breyer said Del Biaggio's cooperation with investigators once his fraud was discovered spared him a longer prison sentence of more than 10 years .
He filed for bankruptcy and many of his assets , including his Nashville Predators stake , will be sold by court order .
On Tuesday , while his weeping parents and friends looked on , Del Biaggio tearfully apologized and vowed to pay back everyone .
" I was blinded by pride and ego , " he said .
" Everyone makes mistakes .
I will come back from this and I refuse to let this define my life . "
Following up our work with Google in Mountain View this week ( Federation day ) , here is the in a few step how to configure Google Wave reference implementation .
Using Java 6
Make sure you have Java 1.6.0 installed on your system to run Google reference implementation .
For example , on Mac OS X you can change Java preferences or type the following commands :
$ export JAVA_HOME=/System/Library /Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home
$ export PATH=$JAVA_HOME / bin:$ PATH
Getting the code
To retrieve the code , you need to have Mercurial installed on your system .
Type hg –version to check that this is the case .
If you need to install it , you can download a binary version for Windows or Mac OS X from this page .
Then , check out the code with Mercurial .
hg clone https://wave-protocol.googlecode.com/hg/ wave-protocol
To compile the code , type :
ant
The dist directory should now contain the resulting version of the Google Wave server : fedone - 0.2.jar
Creating the certificates for Google Wave server
The process to create those self - signed certificates are described on Google Wave wiki : Certificates .
Configuring ejabberd
To configure ejabberd , simply add a new listener service in the listen section of the configuration file :
{listen ,
[
...
{ 8888 , ejabberd_service , [ {access , all} , {shaper_rule , fast} ,
{hosts , [ " wave.process-one.net " ] ,
[ {password , " foobar " } ] }
]}
]} .
You can then restart ejabberd .
The port 8888 should now be open and ready to accept connections from the Google Wave server .
Starting the Google Wave server
With the following example command , we launch the Wave server reference implementation and ask it to connect as a component to ejabberd .
java - jar dist / fedone -0.2.jar --client_frontend_hostname localhost --client_frontend_port 3456 --xmpp_component_name=wave --xmpp_server_hostname=process-one.net --xmpp_server_ip=127.0.0.1 --xmpp_server_port=8888 --xmpp_server_secret foobar -- xmpp_server_ping= " " --certificate_domain process-one.net --certificate_private_key test.key --certificate_files test.cert --waveserver_disable_verification true
You should now see the Google Wave component in the server service discovery :

Executives at Britain 's top companies saw their basic salaries leap 10 % last year , despite the onset of the worst global recession in decades , in which their companies lost almost a third of their value amid a record decline in the FTSE .
The Guardian 's annual survey of boardroom pay reveals that the full - and part - time directors of the FTSE 100 , the premier league of British business , shared between them more than £ 1bn .
Bonus payouts were lower , but the basic salary hikes were more than three times the 3.1 % average pay rise for ordinary workers in the private sector .
The big rise in directors ' basic pay – more than double the rate of inflation last year – came as many of their companies were imposing pay freezes on staff and starting huge redundancy programmes to slash costs .
The Guardian data also shows that a coterie of elite bosses at the helm of multinational corporations are seeing their overall pay packets soar ever higher .
The 10 most highly paid executives earned a combined £ 170 m last year – up from £ 140 m in 2007 .
Five years ago , the top 10 banked some £ 70 m .
The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , Vince Cable , said : " The Guardian 's analysis shows the breathtaking cynicism involved in a lot of executive pay deals , which are unrelated to either personal or corporate performance and involve people who are very well off helping themselves to larger salaries when private sector wages in many companies are being cut . "
The stealth increases in basic pay took much of the sting out of falls in bonuses tied to the performances of their companies .
Overall pay for directors of FTSE companies , including bonuses , fell by an average of 5 % .
The average chief executive of a blue - chip company now earns a basic salary of £ 791,000 .
However , adding bonus payments , share awards and the value of perks ranging from cars and drivers to school fees and dental work , the average pay package rises dramatically .
Nearly a quarter of FTSE chief executives received total 2008 pay packages in excess of £ 5 m , and 22 directors now have basic salaries of more than £ 1m .
The survey is likely to spark renewed calls for shareholders to take a tougher line to control boardroom pay .
Earlier this year , City minister Lord Myners accused shareholders of behaving like " absentee landlords " .
In the wake of the banking crisis , there has been a wave of shareholder revolts over directors ' remuneration .
But even if investors vote against over - generous boardroom payouts , companies are not obliged to take their views into account .
Some of the City 's biggest and most influential shareholders are also part of the problem – their bosses are among those raking in multimillion - pound salaries .
Michael McLintock , a director of Prudential and the boss of its investment arm , which holds big stakes in thousands of companies , was last year paid £ 6.6 m – putting him among the 25 best - paid bosses in the UK .
Brendan Barber , general secretary of the TUC , said : " The recession has done nothing to stop the gap between top directors and the rest of their staff getting wider every year .
" It is even more offensive when the Institute of Directors has called for spending cuts that would hit pensioners , the poor and low - paid public sector staff .
We 've already had the 1980s - style recession , it looks depressingly like we are going back to 1980s greed - is - good politics , too . "
The highest paid boss last year was Bart Becht , the chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser , whose brands include Harpic , Veet and Strepsils .
He was rewarded with £ 36.8 m in pay , bonuses , perks and share incentive schemes .
Becht , 53 , has been a regular feature in the upper echelons of the annual survey for several years , earning more than £ 80 m during the last three years .
The highest paid woman was Cynthia Carroll , the head of the mining giant Anglo American .
The vast multinational also owns a big stake in the De Beers diamond business .
Carroll , a 52 - year - old American , earned a basic salary of more than £ 1 m last year , but benefits , bonus payments and share awards took her total payout to nearly £ 4 m .
She was also paid another £ 93,000 sitting on the board of BP .
The glass ceiling , however , appears to be almost entirely intact .
Just one in 15 boardroom seats are occupied by women – and most of those are non-executive , part - time directors .
Only 22 women hold full - time executive director positions , involved in the day - to - day running of the business .
The best - paid boardroom last year was that of Tullow Oil , a London - based oil exploration business , where 11 directors picked up a total of £ 59 m .
Most of their gains came from share options , as they cashed in on a share price that had soared along with the oil price .
The directors made much more from their cheap share handouts than the rest of the 470 - strong workforce were paid in the year .
Despite the credit crunch , the best - paid employees are still those working for City - based firms .
The average pay at money broker ICAP , which employs 4,330 staff , was more than £ 200,000 .
Hedge fund group Man had the second best - paid staff .
Its 1,776 employees were paid a total of £ 353 m in 2008 – an average £ 198,000 each .
Five years ago the Guardian survey showed that the average salary at Man was £ 100,000 .
The chief executives of those two companies also feature among the highest - paid FTSE 100 chiefs .
Man boss Stanley Fink , who has now stepped down , received £ 15 m last year , while ICAP 's Michael Spencer received nearly £ 7 m .
At the other end of the spectrum , the worst - paid staff are those working in the retail and leisure sectors and for mining companies .
In early July , U.S. Army Colonel Timothy Reese committed truth .
According to a story by Michael Gordon in the New York Times ( reprinted in the Cleveland Plain Dealer , where I saw it ) , Colonel Reese wrote
By William Lind" Military.com " --
In early July , U.S. Army Colonel Timothy Reese committed truth .
According to a story by Michael Gordon in the New York Times ( reprinted in the Cleveland Plain Dealer , where I saw it ) , Colonel Reese wrotean unusually blunt memo ( concluding ) that Iraqi forces suffer from entrenched deficiencies but are now able to protect the Iraqi government and that it is time “ for the U.S. to declare victory and go home .
” As the old saying goes , ‘ Guests , like fish , begin to smell after three days , ’ ” Reese wrote .
“ Since the signing of the 2009 Security Agreement , we are guests in Iraq , and after six years in Iraq , we now smell bad to the Iraqi nose .
” As usual , committing truth horrified Reese ’s superiors .
Michael Gordon reported : Those ( Reese ’s ) conclusions are not shared by the senior U.S. Commander in Iraq , Gen. Ray Odierno . . . A spokeswoman for Odierno said that the memo did not reflect the official stance of the U.S. military and was not intended for a broad audience .
Truth never is .
On the situation in Iraq as on everything else , the American people get the mushroom treatment .
That is how Brave New World works .
In fact , Colonel Reese ’s conclusion , that we should leave Iraq as quickly as we can , is so obvious it raises some second - order questions .
First , exactly why are we keeping 130,000 men in a horribly exposed position , their main LOC running parallel to a potential enemy ’s front for 1000 miles , surrounded by a slowly accelerating civil war ?
The official answer , that “ we are there to back up the Iraqi government , ” does n’t wash .
The Iraqi government and its security forces represent the currently dominant Shiite faction , nothing more .
There is no state .
There wo n’t be one until the Iraqis settle their own differences , by fighting .
Our presence may delay that conflict , but can not prevent it .
So , Mr. Obama , what ’s the real agenda ?
Under Bush , we knew : an Iraq that had been reduced to an American client state was to provide us with military bases from which we could dominate the region and an unlimited supply of oil .
Is the Bush administration ’s agenda now the Obama administration ’s agenda ?
If not , what is ?
Exactly why are 130,000 U.S. troops hanging out in a bad part of town with a “ kick me ” sign taped to their backs ?
Inertia ?
Indecision ?
What ?
That ’s one second - order question .
Another one is , why is no one in Congress asking the first question ?
Iraq seems to have vanished off Washington ’s radar screen , despite the fact that so long as we ’re there , we are smoking in the powder magazine .
It seems that whatever the Obama administration ’s agenda in Iraq is , it has gathered virtually unanimous support in Congress .
Having worked on the Hill , I know some institutional reasons for that .
Congress focuses on whatever the voters are focused on , which at the moment means the economy .
But even there , Iraq raises one of its hydra heads .
The American occupation of Iraq continues to burn through money at the cyclic rate .
So why are n’t the Blue Dog Democrats and other deficit hawks howling about our continued stay ?
All we hear is the silence of the sheep .
There are two possible explanations for the Obama administration ’s remarkable failure to use its mandate to get out of Iraq while we still can .
The first suggests some deep , dark plot , involving money , oil , the SMEC and the SMEC ’s Washington ’s agents in the White House .
During the Bush administration , this explanation was plausible .
It is still possible , but I think less likely true .
The more likely truth is that the Obama administration is a mile wide and an inch deep .
The public is beginning to sense this , as President Obama ’s falling approval ratings show .
But within the Establishment , which includes Congress and most of the press , America ’s first black President remains immune to criticism because he is America ’s first black President .
Were the current President , say , a Georgia cracker , the Establishment would already have him in the stocks , subject to a barrage of rotten fruit .
But even if President Obama were himself a man of depth and wisdom , an administration is much more than one man .
Most of the Obama administration ’s leading figures are merely second and third - stringers from the Clinton administration , resurrected as zombies ( starting with Hillary herself ) .
I do n’t know of a single strategist among the lot .
Most are playing at government , just as little girls play house .
If there is one among the lot who can think beyond the end of his nose – Jim Jones , has the cat got your tongue ?
–he would do well to quote Colonel Reese ’s words to the President :
We now have an Iraqi government that has gained its balance and thinks it knows how to ride the bike in the race …
Our hand on the back of the seat is holding them back and causing resentment .
We need to let go before we both tumble to the ground .
With a thud that will be heard around the world .

The world 's biggest naked protest : 50 + cities and thousands of riders participate worldwide , including around 3,000 in the UK each year .
It started more than a quarter - century ago as just another far - out idea from decidedly outside - the - mainstream politician Rep. Ron Paul -- allow detailed congressional audits of some of the most sensitive activities of the Federal Reserve .
For years , his proposal was as unlikely to become law as other longtime quests of the strongly libertarian Texas Republican , such as returning the nation to the gold standard and abolishing the Internal Revenue Service .
But Paul ’s idea to hold the Fed more accountable has gained traction throughout the financial crisis .
On Friday , it moved a clear step closer to reality when the Democratic chairman of the House Financial Services Committee said he would push it forward .
The bill got exposure when Paul ran for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination .
Then the Fed became a huge , controversial player in battling the financial crisis , invoking emergency powers to use hundreds of billions of dollars to help engineer the sale of Bear Stearns Cos. and bail out American International Group Inc .

Paul ’s legislation now has become a rallying point for Republicans and Democrats angry over the bailouts and the Fed ’s increased and mysterious role in the economy .
More than two - thirds of the members of the House of Representatives have signed on as co-sponsors of Paul ’s “ audit the Fed ” bill .
The Fed strongly opposes the legislation , saying it would subject its decisions to political influence that could shake market confidence .
The support of Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) gives a major boost to Paul ’s 26 - year push to allow the Government Accountability Office to conduct detailed audits of some of the Fed ’s crucial activities , such as setting monetary policy and short - term lending to banks through its discount window .
Both actions are couched in various amounts of secrecy : minutes of monetary policy meetings are n’t publicly released for three weeks , transcripts are shielded for five years , and banks that borrow through the discount window are never revealed to avoid the perception that they might be in trouble .
Federal Reserve officials oppose the legislation , but Frank said he was committed to including it as part of a package of bills to revamp the financial regulatory system .

“ We are serious about some legislation in this regard , ” Frank said during a hearing he held on the bill -- the first since Paul originally introduced it in 1983 .
Democrats and Republicans expressed strong support , reflecting anti-Fed sentiment in Congress , a hurdle to President Obama ’s plan to increase the Fed ’s power as part of his financial regulation overhaul .
“ Nobody in my district thinks the Fed has done such a good job of running the economy that we should continue to cloak them in secrecy to protect them from second - guessing , ” said Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - Sherman Oaks ) .
Paul said the Fed ’s increased profile during the financial crisis has led to questions about its complex operations and anger over its ballooning balance sheet , which has taxpayers on the hook for trillions of dollars in lending related to the financial crisis .
Americans “ are disgusted and they put pressure on Congress . . . .
The people said that it ’s time you guys woke up and started the proper oversight , ” Paul said after the hearing .

The Obama administration wants to give the Fed authority to supervise and regulate large institutions whose failure would pose a risk to the economy .
The proposal adds to worries about the limited information on Fed activities .
Frank reflected that , saying he also wanted to rein in the Fed ’s emergency lending powers .
But he expressed concerns that information from GAO audits could disrupt financial markets , saying he would seek to mandate a delay in the release of some information .
“ No one should be able to do business with the federal government in secret forever .
But we do recognize that if it ’s instantly available , there can be a market impact that would not be a good idea , ” Frank said .
Paul said a wait of three to six months seemed reasonable .
Scott G. Alvarez , the Fed ’s general counsel , said that when Congress allowed GAO audits of the Fed in 1978 , it specifically exempted certain “ highly sensitive areas , ” including monetary policy deliberations and actions , discount window operations , and transactions with foreign central banks and governments .
Detailed information about those activities “ would cause the markets and the public to lose confidence in the independence and judgment of the Federal Reserve , ” Alvarez told the committee .

He noted that a full , independent audit of the Fed ’s financial operations is conducted every year and that Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has taken steps to increase the amount of information the central bank releases .
Alvarez said GAO audits were not like traditional accounting audits .
The congressional watchdog has power to question Fed officials and to make policy judgments about the central bank ’s operations .
“ The concern that we have is that monetary policy , to be effective . . . , has to be as free as possible from political considerations , ” Alvarez said .
But Paul questioned what the Fed was hiding .

“ Fifteen or 20 years ago , nobody really cared , ” he said , noting that most people knew the Fed only for its interest - rate decisions .
“ Now they ’re wondering whether it is n’t the Fed that stirred things up . ”

GOALTENDERS
CROPS are dying .
Throughout central and southern
Texas swimmers are being turned away from lakes and pools : the dwindling water supply is for drinking , not splashing around in .
In San Antonio people are under strict orders to curb their water use , and if you see your neighbours watering the lawn you are supposed to report them to the police .
One town resorted to a prayer service ; it got 0.03 inches ( 0.8 mm ) .
In June and July Austin hit triple - digit temperatures on 39 days .
Texas 's summer has been unusually hot and dry , and punishingly so .
According to the state Department of Agriculture , 77 of Texas 's 254 counties are experiencing “ exceptional ” drought conditions , the worst category going .
The swathe spans roughly one - fifth of the state , an area larger than Massachusetts , New Jersey and Connecticut combined .
Agriculture is the business that is hardest hit .
Losses are already estimated at $ 3.6 billion and rising .
( Under normal circumstances farmers and ranchers bring in about $ 20 billion a year . )
Travis Miller , an agronomist at Texas A&M University 's AgriLife centre , reckons that the people being hurt most at the moment are small cow - and - calf operations .
Their forage and water supplies have diminished , but the cattle must still be fed .
Smaller outfits seldom have much of a cushion to buy extra feed , and Texas had a nasty drought last summer , too .
“ It 'll rain again , and we 'll buy some more cows , ” says Mr Miller .
“ But right now we 're selling a lot of cows , and selling a lot of calves , and it 'll take a while to build that back up . ”
There is little relief on the horizon .
Last year Congress passed a farm bill that provides several billion dollars in relief for losses sustained that year , but those funds will not be disbursed until the autumn .
Last month Texas 's governor , Rick Perry , issued a disaster proclamation for much of the state , noting that the drought conditions have worsened the threat of wildfires .
If the federal government declares a state of emergency , Texas ranchers will be eligible for low - interest loans and other forms of aid .
So far the national Department of Agriculture has demurred , though Texans can get their hands on some federal money through a grasslands - conservation programme .
There might , however , be a silver lining .
All the water restrictions and conservation measures may have the effect of encouraging Texans to pay more attention to water management .
This is a growing concern not just in the Lone Star state but all over America 's arid south - west .
Amy Hardberger , of the Environmental Defence Fund in Austin , suggests that asking people to stop watering their lawns in the blistering afternoon sun is like asking them to swap their light bulbs for the energy - efficient variety : not a cure - all , but a valuable conceptual lesson .
“ You can't do the broader - context stuff unless people understand it in their day - to - day lives , ” she says .
Meanwhile , everyone is hoping for a change in the weather .

Call To Action : September 22 - 25 : Resist the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh
Join Thousands at a Three Day Convergence of Action , Resistance and Hope
Pittsburghers did n’t ask the G20 to come here , but it is our intention that the worldview the summit represents will die here .
This September 22 - 25 Pittsburgh will host the next summit of the G20 , a group of finance ministers and central bank governors from the world ’s largest economies who meet twice yearly to discuss and coordinate the international financial system .
Around 1,500 delegates , including heads of state , will be here along with more than 2,000 members of the media , and thousands of police and security agents tasked with squelching dissent .
This summit , and the predecessor meetings this past April in London , occurs on the heels of the worldwide financial meltdown that has been severely impacting hundreds of millions around the world .
Since its inception , the G20 has been a tool used to promote a world vision based on the ability of capital to move as it pleases , at the expense of labor , human rights and the environment .
Now that the system these leaders have forced on the world is in crisis they continue to operate as if they have the answer .
We know that they do not .
To save countries , they propose we turn to institutions such as the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , an entity that has historically imposed murderous structural adjustment programs on the world ’s poor .
G20 summits , alongside other meetings of institutions such as the World Bank , the IMF and the World Trade Organization , have rightfully been targeted by hundreds of thousands of people around the world because they represent a global vision based on war - making , social and economic injustice , and corporate greed .
Pittsburgh will take its place alongside people around the world who have protested and resisted such gatherings in their hometowns .
Pittsburgh was chosen as the host city because of its history , and because the President is looking to buttress his working class credentials .
It is true that our city has much to offer the world in terms of progress , we just happen to disagree with the politicians on what these words mean or what others should take from our experience .
Pittsburgh has experienced 50 years of population loss and industrial decline as well as more than 150 years of industrial class conflict .
We have gained an instinctual knowledge that you get what you are willing to fight for .
We celebrate that worker and community self - organization has often succeeded where government , bosses and the supposedly enlightened have failed .
What has carried us through the tough times has been our relationships , the tight knit nature of our mostly non-corporate dominated neighborhoods , a do - it - yourself ethic , the unpretentious manner in which people treat each other , and a sense of local pride that is n’t based on salary or one ’s place in some hierarchy .
Pittsburgh never died , and the currently - in - vogue talk of " rebirth " measures success , growth , and progress in terms of the number of corporations based here , the multi-national profits , or the success of our politicians at going from Mayors to County Executives to Governors .
For our measuring stick , we look to whether or not all have the resources needed to lead and pursue rewarding lives , and if we are meeting community needs without the involvement of the state .
We look to the health of our environment and the treatment of other living things , the equality of educational opportunities , the degree to which we lessen our participation in the exploitation of others , and how successful we are in moving towards a new kind of society in which your success and ability to survive is not at the expense of others .
And in these respects , our city is making progress .
We find inspiration and common cause in the efforts of the multitude of other projects and initiatives that are transforming Pittsburgh into a more just and sustainable place to live , efforts that are in a conflictual relationship with state power , and will be joining resistance to the G20 .
And truly , if the G20 were about anything besides state power and money it would be these efforts that other countries would be coming here to discuss and look at , because there is much that we have to offer in creating a better world .
Pittsburgh is not without its problems , and there is much that needs to be addressed .
During the summit and its lead - up little will be said about the troubling grip the UPMC medical industrial complex and others hold over the region , the chronic illnesses caused by the extremely high levels of particulate matter in our air , the troubling ethical questions posed by the warfare robotics that are being pioneered here , the police violence and acts of unaccountable brutality against the public , a stacked deck against labor organizing , a depressingly inadequate public transit system , and a political process marked by a lack of ethical accountability and transparency .
We should be clear then , we love our city , and in so far as we see the G20 as a threat to our collective health and well - being we intend to be an obstacle to its ability to function .
This is an unavoidable decision given what the summit is , and what it represents .
The presence of the G20 summit in Pittsburgh will be a major – if short - lived – disruption to the city and the people who work and live here , with or without protests .
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl has acknowledged as much , stating the summit will result in " chaos " due to security cordons , increased traffic , etc .
The government has already staked out its position : the needs of 20 politicians justify whatever disruption and cost to our city , and the responsibility felt by thousands to participate in resistance to the G20 and to articulate an alternate vision for society is more than unimportant , it ’s a threat .
Based on past summits the media will play the state game by focusing on whether protesters will be able to disrupt the ability of the summit to meet , using ominous and sensationalist stories with unsubstantiated claims of evil outsiders come to wreck havoc on the good people , because these stories , even if refuted and later disproved , serve to justify attacks on the public ’s liberties and dignity .
This must not , and will not , deter resistance .
The stakes are too high .
The real value of this summit , to its participants and those resisting it , is not in the substance of the " leaders ’ " discussions .
Our power is not in whether or not we have the ability to prevent a bunch of finance ministers and heads of state from talking .
The real importance is in the way an undisrupted ceremony reinforces the dominant worldview .
If that view is flawed , it must be rejected , and the spotlight such a gathering creates must be one in which people will manifest liberating social conflict .
We therefore believe that the necessary attempts of thousands to interfere with the summit are not an ends in and of themselves , they are a critical part of the means we can use to achieve the victory we are collectively organizing for in September : to heighten existing social resistance , and to present an alternative narrative of why our world is the way it is .
We must make it clear that the world need not be this way , and talk about our vision for a movement towards a new society based not on profit and coercion but rooted in meeting collective needs for both material comfort and the freedom to pursue fulfilling lives of opportunity and dignity .
In this effort we invite and encourage your participation !

Jennifer S. Altman for The New York Times
A 72 - year - old Harlem business owner used a shotgun to blast four men who tried to rob his restaurant - supply business Thursday afternoon , killing two and sending two others to the hospital with gunshot wounds , the New York City police said .
The business , the Kaplan Brothers Blue Flame Corporation , at 523 West 125th Street , near Amsterdam Avenue , sells commercial gas and electric ranges , as well as parts and repairs .
The police said that the four would - be robbers entered the business and announced that they were robbing it .
One of them took out a Glock 9 - mm pistol and started to pistol - whip a 33 - year - old employee inside the store .
The owner then took out a shotgun and opened fire , striking the four men .
Public records identify the owner as Charles J. Augusto Jr. , 72 .
The police said they did not believe the shotgun — a Winchester 12 - gauge pump shotgun with a pistol grip handle — had been registered , as city law requires .
The police also recovered the pistol used by the would - be robber .
Calls about the shooting began coming in at 3:09 p.m .
One man died at the scene and a second , who was taken to at St. Luke ’s Hospital at 3:22 p.m. , later died of his injuries .
A third man injured in the shooting walked into St. Luke ’s — which is about 12 blocks to the south of the business , in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan — with gunshot injuries .
The fourth man was found nearby with gunshot wounds , the police said .
As the police cordoned off the scene , a large crowd of onlookers gathered around the site of the shooting .
Near the business are two churches , Antioch Baptist Church and the Manhattan Pentecostal Church ; the 26th Precinct station house ; and the Our Children ’s Foundation , an afterschool program .
Nearly two hours after the shooting , the body of a dead man lay on the sidewalk , its upper half covered in white plastic .
The man wore gray pants and white shoes .
The sneakers pointed up .
A woman who answered the phone at Mr. Augusto ’s house in Irvington , in Westchester County , N.Y. , said the family had no comment .
“ They ’re very upset , the people who live in the area , ” said Sarah Martin , the president of the residents ’ association at the General Grant Houses , one of the city ’s largest public housing developments .
The complex , which contains nine buildings and about 4,500 residents , is across 125th Street from the business where the shooting occurred .
Ms. Martin , who walked outside to look at the scene of the shooting , said that bystanders appeared to be sympathetic to the business owner .
“ People are saying things like , ‘ How the hell are you going to try to rob someone in broad daylight ? ’
The police have it all blocked off . ”
One bystander , Venus Singleton , 51 , said that an employee at the business , known as J. B. , was well - liked in the community .
“ I hope that the gun was licensed , and that he was in his rights , ” she said .
Another bystander , Ricardo Gonzalez , 37 , said he used to do odd jobs at Blue Flame for a few extra dollars .
Mr. Gonzalez said the business ’s owner , known to everyone as Gus , was also well - regarded in the neighborhood .
“ He ’s a good dude , helps out the neighborhood , ” Mr. Gonzalez said .
Mr. Gonzalez said that J. B. had worked for the business for at least a decade and was one of Gus ’s most trusted workers .
According to a 1989 article in The New York Times , Blue Flame repairs old gas and electric commercial ranges .
The article reported that Charles Augusto , president of the business , which was founded in the late 1920s , could repair stoves made as far back as the 1920s .
A 2001 item in The Times reported that Blue Flame also sold discounted commercial ranges and ovens that had once been used by restaurants .
A. G. Sulzberger , Bobby Allyn and Anahad O’Connor contributed reporting .

Robben Island Prison , located near Cape Town , was a place of imprisonment for over 400 years .
It was a perfect place to lock up political troublemakers and social outcasts , and you can still feel the atmosphere of despair inside these prison walls .

Abashiri Prison Museum — Abashiri City Hokkaido , Japan
The Abashiri Prison was in use until 1984 .
Presently you can see models of prisoners throughout the prison museum showing the prisoners ’ daily lives in Abashiri .
The models kind of tone down real prison life though , giving us a definite feeling that this is not real .

Maitland Gaol — East Maitland , NSW , Australia
Maitland Gaol is the longest continuously operating correctional institution in Australia with a 150 - year history .
The first prisoners arrived here in 1848 , and the Gaol was closed in 1998 .
On my personal opinion it never should have been opened as a museum .
You ’ll understand what I mean when you ’ll take a look at the photos .
They are much too outspoken to be exhibited .

Old Melbourne Gaol — Melbourne , Victoria , Australia
The Old Melbourne Gaol has a long history .
It was opened in 1839 and was closed in 1929 .
Throughout these years people lived their lives inside its walls .
Though the prison still looks the way it used to be , the building itself has a certain romance .
The prison was designed by British prison engineer Joshua Jebb , and the Old Melbourne Gaol closely reminds me of the Pentonville Model Prison in London .

Clink Prison — South Bank , London , UK
The Clink Prison was owned by the Winchester Bishops , and thus mostly religious offenders and debtors were imprisoned here .
The prison burned down in the Gordon Riots of 1780 , but the Clink Museum
still paints a realistic picture of prison life in the middle ages for tourists .
Interesting exhibitions and old weapons make you feel almost like you ’re in a castle rather than an old prison .

Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial — Dachau , Germany
Much has been said and written about the Nazi concentration camps .
Such places will never be alive again .
Thousands of people were killed , and thousands of people died from depletion .
It was the first Nazi concentration camp , and served as a model for later camps .
Though Dachau was not an extermination camp the suffering of the prisoners will always live in its walls .
In one of the photos you will see the crematory .
Those who could n’t work were no longer fed .
They died from hunger and were then burnt in this room .

Alcatraz — San Francisco , CA , USA
Chances are good that you ’ve heard about Alcatraz .
Probably America ’s most famous prison , Alcatraz operated as a federal prison from 1934 until 1963 .
That might not be long compared to most of the prisons on our list today , but its rich history definitely makes this prison - turned - museum worth the mention .

Eastern State Penitentiary — Philadelphia , PA , USA
Eastern State Penitentiary was opened in 1892 .
It ’s considered to be the world ’s first true penitentiary — a prison designed to inspire penitence in the hearts of convicts .
It was used as a model for about 300 other prisons around the world and was closed in 1971 , opening its doors now as a museum ( and a popular yearly Halloween attraction ) .

Fremantle Prison — Fremantle , Western Australia
The Fremantle Prison was built by convicts in the 1850s and was closed as a place of incarceration in 1991 after 136 years of continuous use .
It was opened to the public in 1992 as a tourist site .
I do n’t feel like visiting it on my own though — the photos are enough give me the full picture of that sorrowful place .

With two laptop - loving children and a Jack Russell terrier hemmed in by an electric fence , Peter Troast figured his household used a lot of power .
Just how much did not really hit him until the night the family turned off the overhead lights at their home in Maine and began hunting gadgets that glowed in the dark .
“ It was amazing to see all these lights blinking , ” Mr. Troast said .
As goes the Troast household , so goes the planet .
Electricity use from power - hungry gadgets is rising fast all over the world .
The fancy new flat - panel televisions everyone has been buying in recent years have turned out to be bigger power hogs than some refrigerators .
The proliferation of personal computers , iPods , cellphones , game consoles and all the rest amounts to the fastest - growing source of power demand in the world .
Americans now have about 25 consumer electronic products in every household , compared with just three in 1980 .
One can certainly understand why the Khang family is a bit confused .
This week the Minneapolis police department gave awards to eight police officers who raided the wrong home last year and exchanged gunfire with the father of six who thought that the house was being burglarized .
The police have apologized for shooting up the home containing Khang , his wife , and six children aged 3 to 15 .
It did n’t help much .
The house was destroyed and they could not afford to fix it up — and ultimately lost the house altogether .
This is another case example why the growing use of “ no knock ” warrants is so dangerous .
The SWAT team mistakingly raided the home thinking that they would find a drug felon .
When the police came busting through the door , Khang thought he was defending his family when he shot through the door .
The SWAT team responded with a torrent of gunfire .
Khang immediately stopped when he understood them to be police but rounds tore through the small house as the children screamed .
In the course of the gunfire , the police received “ received shrapnel damage to body armor and their ballistic helmets . ”
Shrapnel to their helmets and body armor would mean that it was not Khang ’s actual rounds but the debris that was flying all over the place as rounds slammed into the wall and furniture .
I can see the police not reprimanding the officers if the mistake was not the result of negligence .
However , to hand out award for a raid that almost killed a family of eight is a bit incomprehensible .
I understand how dangerous these raids can be and that the police did receive gunfire from the father .
These men deserve enormous praise for their daily work in protecting the public .
Yet , the image of a family losing a home while the officers receive such kudos seems a bit callous and over - the - top .

This evening , I attending the Denver JUG where Venkat Subramaniam was speaking about Scala .
Unfortunately , I arrived halfway through his Programming Scala talk and did n't get a chance to learn as much as I wanted to .
What I did see made Scala look very powerful and ( possibly ) easier to learn than Java .
Below are my notes from Venkat 's talk .
Concurrency is important these days because we 're in a world of multiple processors .
When you have multiple threads running at one time , it can become painful .
Before Java , you had to learn the API for multi- threading for each different platform .
With Java 's " Write once , debug everywhere " , you only had to learn one API .
Unfortunately , it 's pretty low level : how to start a thread , manage it , stop it , etc .
You also have to remember where to put synchronize in your code .
With Scala , immutability and its Actors make it easy to program concurrent systems .
For example , here 's a web service that retrieves stock prices in sequential order :
def getyearEndClosing ( symbol : String , year : Int ) = { val url = " http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s= " + symbol + " &a=11&b=01&c " + year + " &d=11&e=31&f= " + year + " &g=m " val data = io .
Source.fromURL(url).mkString val price = data.split ( "
" ) ( 1) .split ( " , " ) ( 4).toDouble Thread.sleep( 1000 ) ; // slow down internet ( symbol , price ) } val symbols = List ( " APPL " , " GOOG " , " IBM " , " JAVA " , " MSFT " ) val start = System.nanoTime val top = ( ( " " , 0.0 ) / : symbols ) { ( topStock , symbol ) => val ( sym , price ) = getYearEndClosing ( symbol , 2008 ) if ( topStock ._2 < price ) ( sym , price ) else topStock } val end = System.nanoTime println ( " Top stock is " + top._1 + " with price " + top._2 ) println ( " Time taken " + ( end - start ) /10000000000.0 )
To make this concurrent , we create Actors .
Actors are nothing but Threads with a built - in message queue .
Actors allow spawning separate threads to retrieve each stock price .
Instead of doing :
symbols.foreach { symbol => getYearEndClosing ( symbol , 2008 ) }
You can add actors :
val caller = self symbols .
foreach { symbol => actor { caller !
getYearEndClosing ( symbol , 2008 ) } }
Then remove val ( sym , price ) = getYearEndClosing ( symbol , 2008 ) and replace it with :
receive { case ( sym : String , price : Double ) => if ( topStock ._2 < price ) ( sym , price ) else topStock }
After making this change , the time to execute the code dropped from ~ 7 seconds to ~ 2 seconds .
Also , since nothing is mutable in this code , you do n't have to worry about concurrency issues .
With Scala , you do n't suffer the multiple - inheritance issues you do in Java .
Instead you can use Traits to do mixins .
For example :
import scala.actors ._ import Actor._ class MyActor extends
Actor { def act ( ) { for ( i <- 1 to 3 ) { receive { case msg => println ( " Got " + msg ) } } }
When extending Actor , you have to call MyActor . start to start the Actor .
Writing actors this way is not recommended ( not sure why , guessing because you have to manually start them ) .
Venkat is now showing an example that counts prime numbers and he 's showing us how it pegs the CPU when counting how many exist between 1 and 1 million ( 78,499 ) .
After adding actor and receive logic , he shows how his Activity Monitor shows 185 % CPU usage , indicating that both cores are being used .
What happens when one of the threads crashes and burns ?
The receive will wait forever .
Because of this , using receive is a bad idea .
It 's much better to use receiveWithin ( millis ) to set a timeout .
Then you can catch the timeout in the receiveWithin block using :
case TIMEOUT => println ( " Uh oh , timed out " )
A more efficient way to use actors is using react instead of receive .
With react , threads leave after putting the message on the queue and new threads are started to execute the block when the message is " reacted " to .
One thing to remember with react is any code after the react block will never be executed .
Just like receiveWithin ( millis ) , you can use reactWithin ( millis ) to set a timeout .
The major thing I noticed between receive and react is Venkat often had to change the method logic to use react .
To solve this , you can use loop ( or better yet , loopWhile ( condition ) ) to allow accessing the data outside the react block .
In conclusion , reactWithin ( millis ) is best to use , unless you need to execute code after the react block .
Conclusion
This was a great talk by Venkat .
He used TextMate the entire time to author and execute all his Scala examples .
Better yet , he never used any sort of presentation .
All he had was a " todo " list with topics ( that he checked off as he progressed ) and a sample .
scala file .
Personally , I do n't plan on using Scala in the near future , but that 's mostly because I 'm doing UI development and GWT and JavaScript are my favorite languages for that .
On the server - side , I can see how it reduces the amount of Java you need to write ( the compiler works for you instead of you working for the compiler ) .
However , my impression is its sweet spot is when you need to easily author an efficient concurrent system .
If you 're looking to learn Scala , I 've heard Scala by Example ( PDF ) is a great getting - started resource .
From there , I believe Programming in Scala and Venkat 's Programming Scala are great books .
A schizophrenic killer tricked health staff into thinking he was not a risk to the public before he murdered a man and ate his brain , a report has said .
Peter Bryan , now 39 , killed Brian Cherry ( 43 ) and ate parts of his body after being allowed to live in the community as an outpatient despite having previous convictions for murder .
Bryan , who was found at Mr Cherry 's flat semi-naked and covered in blood , told police officers : “ I ate his brains with butter .
It was really nice . ”
Then , just weeks after being placed in London 's high security hospital Broadmoor , Bryan killed again , throttling fellow patient Richard Loudwell , 59 , with a flex and smashing his head on the ground .
Loudwell had told staff he was being bullied by Bryan but his pleas for help were | “ ignored ” .
Yesterday two damning independent reports were released .
The first into Bryan 's care while living as an outpatient and a second focusing on his care inside Broadmoor — both revealed a long list of failings by psychiatric and social services .
East London NHS Foundation Trust and West London Mental Health NHS
Trust both apologised but revealed nobody had been disciplined as a result .

Alle Fotos in die­sem Arti­kel sind von Jor­ge - Alber­to Reich und CC - BY - SA - lizen­ziert .
Am Sams­tag gab sich Frau von der Ley­en die Ehre auf dem Linde­ner Markt­platz in Han­no­ver .
Eini­ge Han­no­ver­sche
Pira­ten woll­ten sich nicht ent­ge­hen las­sen , das mal anzu­schau­en und in geeig­ne­ter Form zu beglei­ten .
Los ging ’s um zehn Uhr mor­gens .
Alle wich­ti­gen Par­tei­en hat­ten rund um die Stra­ßen­kreu­zung neben dem Markt­platz ihre Info­stän­de auf­ge­baut .
Alle ?
Nicht ganz .
Die Pira­ten hat­ten zwar kei­nen eige­nen Info­stand , aber irgend­wie waren da plötz­lich zwölf Leu­te .
Und die sind dann alle mal rüber zur CDU , als Ursu­la dort ein­traf .
Und wir waren nicht mal die ein­zi­gen .
Wei­te­re poli­tisch inter­es­sier­te Bür­ger gesell­ten sich zu uns , teil­wei­se pas­send mit „ Zensursula ” - T- Shirts beklei­det .
Wenig erfreut waren die etwa sie­ben loka­len CDU - Leu­te am Stand .
Sie hät­ten es wohl wesent­lich lie­ber gese­hen , wenn man sie in Ruhe und unwi­der­spro­chen ihre Unwahr­hei­ten Infor­ma­tio­nen unters
Volk hät­te brin­gen las­sen , aber immer­hin soll­te das hier sowas wie ’ne Bür­ger­sprech­stun­de sein .
Und Bür­ger sind ja nun mal auch wir .
Kai hat dann auch umge­hend das Gespräch gesucht .
War aber nicht so ein­fach .
Mit fun­dier­ten Gegen­mei­nun­gen kon­fron­tiert , wählt Frau von der Ley­en wohl am liebs­ten die „ Mono­logstra­te­gie ” – das heißt Kai wur­de so lan­ge zuge­tex­tet , bis alle Phra­sen abge­ar­bei­tet waren : „ Natür­lich wol­len wir kei­ne Zen­sur , die Netz­sper­ren sind die bes­te Lösung über­haupt , bla bla bla ” .
Ein­ge­hen auf Nach­fra­gen : Fehl­an­zei­ge .
Die jun­ge Dame auf dem Bild trug übri­gens ein Schild mit der Auf­schrift „ Weg­schau­en statt bekämp­fen ?
Sper­ren statt löschen ? ” .
Sie wur­de von Frau von der Ley­en mit den Wor­ten begrüßt : „ Sie sind also dafür , dass man sich im Inter­net Kin­der­por­nos anschau­en kann ? ! ”
Da erüb­rigt sich jeder wei­te­re Kom­men­tar .
Die­je­ni­gen , die die­se „ Gesprä­che ” live gehört hat­ten ( ich stand lei­der etwas zu weit weg ) , haben spä­ter ein­hel­lig gemeint , Frau von der Ley­en hät­te sich voll­stän­dig merk­be­freit gezeigt .
Es scheint so , die Frau glau­be wirk­lich und gera­de­zu fana­tisch dar­an , sie wür­de da etwas ganz Tol­les zu Wege brin­gen .
In so einer Situa­ti­on sind ratio­na­le Argu­men­te lei­der völ­lig nutz­los und eigent­lich ist das ja einer der Grün­de , war­um Glau­be und Fana­tis­mus in einer frei­heit­li­chen Demo­kra­tie nichts ver­lo­ren haben .
Womit wir wie­der bei des Pudels Kern ange­kom­men sind , wenn es um Frau von der Ley­en und ihr Ver­ständ­nis von Kom­mu­ni­ka­ti­ons­in­fra­struk­tu­ren geht …
Nach etwa zehn Minu­ten Zwie gesprä­chen neben dem CDU - Stand ging es dann auf den Markt­platz .
Und ob nun gleich ganz vorn …
… beim Fisch­stand …
… beim Kaf­fee - und Tee­stand …
… oder bei all den ande­ren Stän­den , an denen Frau von der Ley­en das Gespräch mit dem Wäh­ler such­te : Im Hin­ter­grund war immer ein knap­pes Dut­zend Men­schen , die mit Pla­ka­ten deut­lich mach­ten , dass sie mit der Poli­tik und den Ansich­ten von Frau von der Ley­en nicht ein­ver­stan­den sind .
All die­se Men­schen waren die gan­ze Zeit über freund­lich und zurück­hal­tend :
Alle sind immer brav hin­ter der CDU - Entou­ra­ge und Frau von der Ley­ens eige­nen Auf­pas­sern geblie­ben , nie­mand hat sich auch von den gele­gent­li­chen Remp­lern des einen oder ande­ren CDU­lers nur im gerings­ten pro­vo­zie­ren las­sen , nie­mand hat sich irgend­wo in den
Weg gestellt oder auch nur ein ein­zi­ges „ Gespräch ” zwi­schen Frau von der Ley­en und den Bür­gern gestört .
Trotz­dem fin­gen die drei anwe­sen­den Poli­zis­ten nach etwa 15 Minu­ten an , von einem Groß­teil der anwe­sen­den Geg­ner die Per­so­na­li­en auf­zu­neh­men .
Die Begrün­dung war , es hand­le sich hier um „ unan­ge­mel­de­te Ver­samm­lung ” und das wur­de dann dann am Hoch­hal­ten der Pla­ka­te fest­ge­macht oder – bei denen , die kei­ne Pla­ka­te dabei hat­ten – dar­an , dass sie halt „ mit­lau­fen wür­den ” und damit auch zu die­ser „ Ver­samm­lung ” gehör­ten .
So eine Begrün­dung ent­behrt auf einem beleb­ten Markt­platz nicht einer gewis­sen Iro­nie .
Ich weiß nicht , ob das jetzt ein Ein­schüch­te­rungs­ver­such war , eine pro­phy­lak­ti­sche Maß­nah­me falls es zu Ran­da­le käme oder ob die CDU gefor­dert hat­te , da „ müs­se doch was getan wer­den gegen die­se Stö­rer ” .
Ich weiß nur , dass kei­ner der betei­lig­ten Pro­tes­tie­rer sich davon beein­dru­cken ließ , alle Schil­der blie­ben oben und Frau von der Ley­en blieb ihre Beglei­tung treu .
( Nach­trag : Beim Max fin­dest sich mitt­ler­wei­le ein Bericht , der eben­falls pro­tes­tiert hat und der „ unan­ge­mel­den Ver­samm­lung ” zuge­rech­net wur­de , obwohl er , wie er betont , allein gekom­men ist und nichts mit der Pira­ten­par­tei zu tun hat . )
Übri­gens waren auch vie­le ande­re Gesprächs­part­ner nicht so recht von Frau von der Ley­en über­zeugt .
Auch bei ande­ren The­men wie Väter­rech­ten , Betreu­ungs­an­ge­bo­ten für Klein­kin­der oder finan­zi­el­ler Fami­li­en­un­ter­stüt­zung waren ihre Ein­las­sun­gen wohl häu­fig sehr scha­blo­nen­ar­tig .
Um punkt 11 Uhr war der Spuk Auf­tritt dann auch schon vor­bei .
Mit­samt ihrer Beglei­tung ent­schweb­te Frau von der Ley­en in ihrer schi­cken Limou­si­ne .
Wir durf­ten uns dann noch ein wenig von einem CDU - Men­schen laut­stark angif­ten las­sen ( „ Ihr soll­tet euch schä­men mit dem Tauss ” ) , der nach der pas­sen­den Erwi­de­rung ( „ Ach , gilt in Ihrer Par­tei das rechts­staat­li­che Prin­zip der Unschulds­ver­mu­tung nicht ? ” ) erheb­lich aus­ge­bremst war .
Ich per­sön­lich hal­te es da zudem mit der unver­gleich­li­chen Vera Drom­busch : „ Wer schreit hat Unrecht . ”
Ansons­ten konn­ten wir noch vie­le Bür­ger über uns und unse­re Zie­le infor­mie­ren , vie­le Fly­er ver­tei­len – und die Jungs , die plötz­lich die Sei­ten­schei­be ihres Autos run­ter­kur­bel­ten und quer über den Platz rie­fen : „ Ihr seid klas­se , ich werd ’ euch wäh­len ! ” haben damit defi­ni­tiv auch nicht die CDU hin­ter uns gemeint . 😉
Par­al­lel hat­te der­weil eine zwei­te Akti­ven­grup­pe den Info­stand in der Han­no­ver­schen Innen­stadt auf­ge­baut .
Etli­che Pira­ten sind noch vom Linde­ner Markt­platz dort­hin gezo­gen und haben die dor­ti­ge Grup­pe ver­stärkt , was ange­sichts des hohen Bür­ger­inter­es­ses auch sehr sinn­voll war .
Zusam­men mit dem Rekord - Stamm­tisch vom Frei­tag abend ( 42 Pira­ten und Inter­es­sen­ten ) ein wahr­haft pira­ti­ges Wochen­en­de !
Einen wei­te­ren Bericht vom Linde­ner Markt­platz mit wei­te­ren Fotos gibt ’s übri­gens drü­ben in Jans hyper -world .
Nach­trag , 2009 - 09 - 26 : Auch im Por­tal „ Han­no­ver ent­de­cken ” gibt es zwi­schen­zeit­lich einen Bericht von Frau von der Ley­ens Besuch mit eini­gen erhel­len­den Details über den äußerst unhöf­li­chen Umgangs­ton von Frau von der Ley­en und ihre CDU - Mit­strei­ter .
The Recording Industry Association of America took the offensive Tuesday against a college student whom a jury concluded in July must pay $ 675,000 for file sharing 30 songs .
The RIAA asked the Massachusetts judge who presided over the Joel Tenenbaum case to issue an injunction Tuesday preventing the 25 - year - old Boston University graduate student from file sharing or assisting others in that endeavor .
It was the same course the RIAA took this summer after it won a whopping $ 1.92 million verdict against a Minnesota woman , Jammie Thomas - Rasset , for purloining 24 music tracks on Kazaa .
An injunction , the RIAA wrote ( . pdf ) the judge who presided over the case , " will prohibit defendant from causing additional irreparable injury to plaintiffs .
Finally , given defendant ’s conduct , both during the course of this litigation and post - trial , in promoting continued piracy , additional injunctive language forbidding defendant from acting in concert with those committing copyright infringement is appropriate . "
Thomas - Rasset and Tenenbaum are the only two defendants who have gone to trial against the RIAA , which has filed about 30,000 - plus lawsuits against individual file sharers in nearly six years .
Most all the other defendants had settled out of court for a few thousand dollars .

The health insurance cartel has shown that it is willing to shell out tens of millions of dollars and fight to the death to stop meaningful health care reform .
One giant of the industry , United Health Group , is going so far as to actually encourage their own employees to educate themselves in anti-reform talking points , and attend tea parties held by a religious extremist .
From TPM :
Last week , UnitedHealth Group -- the second largest health insurance company in the country -- sent out a letter to its employees urging them to call UHG's United for Health Reform Advocacy Hotline to speak with an advocacy specialist about health care reform .
The advocacy specialist , according to the letter , is there to help UHG employees write personalized messages to elected officials , and to arm them with talking points to use at local events in order to better oppose the public health insurance option .
However , a source who 's insured by UHG -- and who also obtained the letter -- called the hotline on Tuesday and says the company directed him to an events list hosted by the right wing America 's Independent Party , and suggested he attend an anti-health care reform tea party sponsored by religious fundamentalist Dave Daubenmire , scheduled for today outside the office of Blue Dog Rep. Zack Space ( D - OH ) .

United claims to be a partner in health care reform , but as d-day puts it they 're in it to win it :

The council paid about £ 800 for six straighteners
Hair straighteners have been introduced to three schools in West Dunbartonshire in a bid to encourage more girls to take part in physical education .
The local council bought them after teenage girls said they worried about " bad hair " after sports classes .
Nine sets of straighteners have been installed in the female changing areas of three new " flagship " schools in the area at a cost of about £ 800 .
The council said the move was part of wider efforts to improve PE facilities .
Hair straighteners are now in place for female pupils at St Peter the Apostle , Clydebank High and Vale of Leven Academy .
' Falling participation '
A council spokeswoman said : " West Dunbartonshire Council has installed nine sets of hair straighteners within the changing facilities at each of the council 's three new flagship schools .
" The council considers the views of pupils to be critical in ensuring that the school environment is as positive and inclusive as possible and pupils were widely consulted during the design phase .
" The falling rate of female participation in sport was a key issue discussed by pupils and improvements to changing and showering facilities , including the installation of hair straighteners , was considered important in reversing this trend .
" The installation amounts to a total expenditure of less than £ 1,000 to encourage more girls to participate in PE and support positive self - image . "
After winning 7.1 per cent of Swedish votes in this year 's European Parliament elections , The Pirate Party has opened up a branch in Australia and plans to contest the next federal election .
The party , which will campaign on a platform of anti-internet censorship and the decriminalisation of non-commercial file sharing , has already signed up 550 members , enough for it to register as a party with the Australian Electoral Commission .
A Pirate Party demonstration in Sweden .
It plans to hold internal elections for leadership positions - president , general secretary , treasurer and their deputies - on October 7 .
But party spokesman Brendan Molloy was quick to point out that free file sharing was only one aspect of the overall mission , which was to " bolster our nation 's Democratic conventions " .
While driving around doing my meaningless tasks in life , I noticed the billboard that is owned / rented by Chick - Fil - A was updated again .
They update it every month or so to be witty , and make some sort of point of how you should eat more chicken .
This time though , I found it stupid…or ironic .
I ’m not sure which .
Here is the sign :
So what is my problem with a simple harmless billboard ?
Well , it ’s blurry , but if you look , the Cows on the billboard have rainbow fro wigs on , sports jerseys that closely resemble football jerseys , and one has a foam finger .
Also this sign was put up just recently , around the start of the Football season .
Now when I , and many of my friends , think about football , we automatically think of Sunday Football .
Here is where I see the problem : ALL CHICK -FIL - A’s ARE CLOSED ON SUNDAY !
Side note :
Yes I know there is Monday Night football , and High School and College games are usually on Fri/Sat .
But the majority of NFL Games are on Sunday .
The Super Bowl is on a Sunday .
Fun Fact : Hitler liked football , except his ball was V1 Rockets , and the uprights was The United Kingdom .
GOAL !

After nearly two decades of futile searching for a vaccine against the AIDS virus , researchers are reporting the tantalizing discovery of antibodies that can prevent the virus from multiplying in the body and producing severe disease .
They do not have a vaccine yet , but they may well have a road map toward the production of one .
A team based at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla reports today in the journal Science that they have isolated two so - called broadly neutralizing antibodies that can block the action of many strains of HIV , the virus responsible for AIDS .
Crucial to the discovery is the fact that the antibodies target a portion of HIV that researchers had not considered in their search for a vaccine .
Moreover , the target is a relatively stable portion of the virus that does not participate in the extensive mutations that have made HIV able to escape from antiviral drugs and previous experimental vaccines .
“ This is opening up a whole new area of science , ” said Dr. Seth F. Berkley , president and chief executive of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative , which funded and coordinated the research .
At least 33 million people worldwide are infected with HIV , and at least 25 million have died from AIDS , according to the World Health Organization .
Two large trials of experimental vaccines have failed -- the most recent , in 2007 , because the vaccine apparently made people more susceptible to infection .
To find the neutralizing antibodies , researchers collected blood samples from more than 1,800 people in Thailand , Australia and Africa who had been infected with HIV for at least three years without the infection proceeding to severe disease .
Such individuals are most likely to produce antibodies that interfere with the replication of the virus .
Researchers at Monogram Biosciences in South San Francisco studied the samples most resistant to infection , then a team from Theraclone Sciences in Seattle isolated the antibodies responsible for the resistance .
They ultimately isolated two antibodies , called PG9 and PG16 , from one African patient .
The antibodies were able to block the activity of about three - quarters of the 162 separate strains of HIV they tested it against .
Immunologist Dennis Burton of Scripps and his colleagues then showed that the antibodies bind to regions of two proteins on the surface of the virus , called gp120 and gp41 , that help the virus invade cells .
These regions had never before been considered as targets for vaccines .
Researchers still have a long way to go to produce a vaccine , however .
The antibodies themselves could potentially be used as a treatment for infected patients who develop severe disease .
But the long - term hope is to find molecules , either synthetic or natural , that can stimulate the body to produce the broadly neutralizing antibodies .
Such molecules could potentially be the basis for a successful vaccine .

Last week the Guardian reported that a Texan board of education wanted to get religion more prominently into the classrooms .
Nothing new there , I hear you say ( OK , I ca n’t actually hear you say that , but I ’ll presume for the sake of this increasingly tortured intro that you did , and you can always email to correct me later ) .
Except this time it ’s not the same old Evolution vs Creationism Intelligent Design debate regarding biology classes and science textbooks – this time the battle lines have been drawn in History .
The christian fundamentalist board wish to amend history lessons to stress the role God played in the initial formation of America .
One of the board members is David Barton , founder of the Christian heritage group WallBuilders whose mission statement is :
“ … to exert a direct and positive influence in government , education , and the family by ( 1 ) educating the nation concerning the Godly foundation of our country ; ( 2 ) providing information to federal , state , and local officials as they develop public policies which reflect Biblical values ; and ( 3 ) encouraging Christians to be involved in the civic arena ” – Source : Wallbuilders
I guess David ’s been too busy reading his Bible to bother reading , say , the US Constitution .
It ’s a shame , because he would n’t even have to read very far into it – in fact the first amendment in the Bill of Rights is :
“ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances ” – Source : US Constitution , quoted here from Wikipedia
This is what ’s often referred to as the ‘ Separation of Church and State ’ clause – prohibiting the establishment of a national religion by the Congress or the preference of one religion over another , non-religion over religion , or religion over non-religion .
If David ’s too busy to read through the constitution of his own country before making bold statements regarding the founding principles of the nation , maybe he has time to look over a few other historical facts .
For example , when we think of religion in America , we might well think of the ‘ One nation under God ’ line in the Pledge of Allegiance – the patriotic mantra recited by millions of American school children every morning .
A line which was only officially adopted in 1954 .
Or perhaps the board should look into the history of the phrase ‘ In God We Trust ’ – the official motto of the United States .
Since 1956 .
America , by the way , was around before 1956 .
Or perhaps the board might want to look at the founding fathers , and their religious beliefs .
Benjamin Franklin was a deist – believing that religious truth in general could be determined using reason and observation of the natural world alone , without a need for either faith or organized religion
was a deist – believing that religious truth in general could be determined using reason and observation of the natural world alone , without a need for either faith or organized religion George Washington believed in religious freedom , and to this day historians and biographers continue to debate the degree to which he can be counted as a Christian , and the degree to which he was a deist .
believed in religious freedom , and to this day historians and biographers continue to debate the degree to which he can be counted as a Christian , and the degree to which he was a deist .
Thomas Jefferson openly opposed organised religious institutions , and even published his own version of the Bible – removing sections of the New Testament containing supernatural aspects
Hardly the basis of the fundamentally - Christian ideology the Texan board would have us believe lies at the historical foundations of America .
Also on the board is Reverend Peter Marshall – a charming preacher from New Orleans .
For a quick flavour of the teachings of this mild - mannered Christian preacher , I ’d recommend a look at his website :
First comes the news that more than 10,000 homosexuals were expected in New Orleans over Labor Day weekend for the 34th annual Southern Decadence party .
It was supposed to start two days after Katrina arrived …
Was [ this ] finally enough for the Lord .
Did He allow Katrina as a judgment on the wickedness and decadence of New Orleans ?
Well , what do you think ?
To borrow the saying from Fox News , “ we report , you decide . ” – Source : Petermarshallministries.com
I ’m sure you agree , he ’s exactly the type of level - headed individual who should be determining what Texan children learn about the world .
The good Reverend also claims there are too few references to American faith in the current curriculum , and told the Wall Street Journal :
“ We ’re in an all - out moral and spiritual civil war for the soul of America , and the record of American history is right at the heart of it ” – Source : Wall Street Journal
The most disturbing aspect of this whole affair , for me , is the troublingly Orwellian echoes – I can’t help but be reminded of Winston Smith , diligently re-writing history for the Ministry of Truth .
“ Those who control the past control the future .
Those who control the present control the past ” – Source : George Orwell , 1984
I suppose the question Texas needs to ask itself , as it faces this next front in the fight against religious indoctrination in schools , is this :
Are David Barton and Peter Marshall really the men they want controlling the future of their children ?
A harmless shard from the shell of a common childhood virus may halt a biological process that kills a significant percentage of battlefield casualties , heart attack victims and oxygen - deprived newborns , according to research presented Sunday , September 6 , 2009 , at the 12th European meeting on complement in human disease in Budapest , Hungary .
Introducing the virus 's shell in vitro shuts down what 's known as the complement response , a primordial part of the immune system that attacks and destroys the organs and vascular lining of people who have been deprived of oxygen for prolonged periods , according to researchers at Children 's Hospital of The King 's Daughters ( CHKD ) and Eastern Virginia Medical School ( EVMS ) , in Norfolk , Va .
The complement response kicks in after the victim has been revived , in what is known as a reperfusion injury .
It does its work slowly but unrelentingly , killing soldiers , infants or heart attack victims over the course of days .
" To find a way to manipulate the complement system pharmacologically has been like a search for the Holy Grail , " said one of the lead researchers , Dr. Kenji Cunnion , an infectious disease physician at CHKD and an associate professor of pediatrics at EVMS .
While Cunnion and Neel Krishna , Ph.D. , a pediatric virologist at CHKD and assistant professor of microbiology at EVMS , focus on pediatric research , they see clear military applications .
" The complement reaction is one of the major causes of death of the battlefield , " said Krishna .
" By the time you get a victim to the hospital , it may be too late . "
Dr. L.D. Britt , M.D. , MPH , Brickhouse professor and chairman of surgery at EVMS , agrees .
" Hemorrhagic shock is the leading cause of death in combat trauma and reperfusion injury plays a significant role both in increased mortality and increased brain damage , " said Britt , senior consultant to the military on combat trauma .
" This research could help save the lives of soldiers , as well as the lives of other trauma victims who have been without oxygen for extended periods . "
Britt has joined Cunnion in Krishna in seeking a grant from the Department of Defense to expedite research and development .
The complement system ranks as one of the oldest biological mechanisms in life 's evolution and exists in almost identical form in everything from seagulls to starfish .
Essentially , the complement system recognizes and destroys potentially toxic substances that gain entry into an organism 's bloodstream .
When a starfish loses a limb , for instance , the complement system sends a contingent of killer cells to block and attack anything that tries to work its way inside .
In human evolution , complement provided an essential natural defense .
" Up until 100 years ago , the vast majority of humans died from infectious diseases , " said Cunnion .
" Nobody died of old age and almost nobody lived long enough to die of a heart attack . "
Thanks to modern medicine , people now live long enough to die from trauma , such as car accidents , or from conditions , such as heart attack and stroke , that can leave cells throughout the body starved for oxygen .
Cells deprived of oxygen often undergo biochemical changes , essentially marking themselves for death .
When blood flow and oxygen are restored , these changes trigger the complement cascade .
The marauding cells unleashed by complement cascade are indiscriminate , killing not only the cell with the biochemical marker but innocent bystander cells as well .
" It 's like throwing a grenade , " said Krishna .
A patient , who has suffered survivable brain damage from oxygen deprivation , might die over several days as swaths of cells are destroyed by this seemingly unstoppable reaction .
Animal research has shown that stopping this complement reaction significantly reduces brain damage .
The complement system is so complex that research scientists spend entire careers studying it , publishing in journals that specialize in this primordial defense mechanism .
In the case of Cunnion and Krishna , discovering how to shut down the complement system resulted from happenstance .
As they worked in neighboring labs , they noticed a similarity in the structure of molecules Cunnion used in his experiments and the protein shell of the astrovirus Krishna studied .
They wondered what would happen if they introduced the astrovirus shell into an assay routinely used in Cunnion 's lab to assess complement activation .
" It was kind of a shot in the dark , " Krishna said .
" We did n't expect anything to happen . "
The complement reaction completely stopped .
###
The presentation in Hungary , " Human Astrovirus Coat Protein Binds C1q and MBL and Inhibits the Classical and Lectin Pathways of Complement Activation , " highlights not only the discovery , but research published in Current Topics in Complement II and the Journal of Virology , describing precisely how this tiny piece of protein halts the complement cascade in its tracks .

August 22 , 2009 -- Pre-revolutionary situation ?
Some analyses of the situation in Honduras are fairly static .
We have to differ with many local and foreign analysts who have tried to understand the situation in Honduras by imposing pre-existing parameters and by using basic concepts of the Marxist dialectic without any scientific criterion .
Many have seen a failure of the Honduran grassroots resistance , failing to understand that historical materialism is not a mathematical formula where only variables change , but rather , a way to interpret reality objectively .
When it comes to analysis it is difficult to get away from " models " and comparisons with this or that previous experience .
Many even speak of a pre-revolutionary situation as if the movement of social forces at any moment could convert itself into a kind of recipe with pre-determined levels , like today insurrection , tomorrow pre-revolution , the day after insurrection , and so on .
But history that follows formulaic patterns or models is not credible .
The reality of the situation with Honduras ' social movements is fairly complex , but clearly reflects the class struggle between the national bourgeoisie and the proletariat .
Now , of course , we conceive of the proletariat as an ensemble of diverse forces that are chemically impure ; an ensemble in which are present labourers , campesinos ( rural workers who represent the majority of workers in the country ) , grassroots churches , professionals , feminist groups , students , teachers , informal workers , the unemployed , and a lot more .
Class position is decisive .
In this country if you are not a member of the oligarchy or one of their lackeys , you ’re proletarian .
Lack of organisation and maturity ?
Some have said that the lack of organisation and maturity of grassroots movements has been a key factor in their " incapacity to take advantage of this conjuncture to take power " .
This ignores that the maturity and organisation of resistance forces is not measured by their capacity to take on the army henchmen of the bourgeois state and defeat them in the short run .
It is measured by their capacity to react and coordinate the masses , something that has been demonstrated from day one of the coup .
The fact that we did not make the news every day is related more to the criterion of " news " held by communications media than to the movement ’s daily actions .
In Honduras , the people are resisting day in and day out .
It would be dogmatic to pretend we have a perfect movement .
The national leadership has made a huge effort to keep the masses from reacting with violence .
It ’s also been clear that there are those who prefer to take their own path and act on the margin of the plans of the resistance .
Others work a lot under the guidance of the organised leadership .
However , to the extent that the movement has been growing , discipline , organisation and consciousness have been strengthened .
We are moving on from reacting in favour of a leader to the clear necessity to found a new country .
In all this we clearly see the dialectic of the resistance ’s nature and its path to victory .
Pessimism
Now what makes for a victory ?
Many have affirmed that the process will lead to a sad , mediated outcome in which the dictatorship and its accomplices end up strengthened , with President Manuel Zelaya tied hand and foot , powerless to do anything .
What 's behind that interpretation ?
Is the idea that everything depends on whether the constitutional president comes back , or does n’t ?
This kind of pessimism is glued to old experiences and underestimates the people ’s capacity to carry on their struggle .
It does not seem very scientific to put " fatal terms " on social processes .
There are essentially two possible short - term scenarios for what may happen in the country : a ) the president returns ; and b ) the president does not return to his post .
No matter the scenario , the struggle will continue because the ultimate goal is the re-founding of our nation , not just the return of President Zelaya .
It should be clear that the current stage of the struggle requires mobilisation for the restoration of constitutional institutions and lawful government .
This is so because letting this coup survive intact would be a grave error given the precedent it would establish for the future of Honduras and of Latin America .
It seems clear that the imperial right sympathises with this strategy ; one sign of that is the recognition and support of the Honduran fascist regime by private enterprise in Guatemala ; without a doubt that country is the next target of the counterrevolutionary continental resurgence .
National Constituent Assembly
The next stage aims to take the power in order to realise a National Constituent Assembly to re-define the legality of the country .
This struggle will follow the electoral path because , among other reasons , taking the road of armed struggle would result in legitimising the arguments of the right .
The imperial media would find it easier to demonise and isolate our movement , just as they have done with the Colombian armed movements .
In no way can the conditions that have come about in this country be considered a defeat .
On the contrary , we have gained a lot , and every day this becomes more and more evident .
It can not be said that this comes late ; it ’s simply an event happening when it must happen .
Once again , it is not dialectical to think that revolutionary movements come about like cultural fashions .
If objective , we will see that pre-revolutionary moments do not exist .
The conditions of struggle in Honduras are rooted in a revolutionary process whose aim is to attain a different society , more just , more equitable , progressive and revolutionary .
We must not , either locally or internationally , fall into despair because of what we see in the daily press , or in the day by day experiences of this revolution that at times seem to raise our spirits , and at times cause great scepticism .
Now the path is laid down and come what may , we are going to follow it through to final victory .

Situación pre revolucionaria ? :
Algunos análisis sobre la situación en Honduras son bastante estáticas
Por Ricardo Arturo Salgado
22 agosto 2009 -- Tenemos que discrepar con muchos analistas , locales y extranjeros , que han tratado de comprender la situación en Honduras aplicando parámetros pre existentes , y utilizando conceptos fundamentales de la dialéctica marxista sin criterio científico .
Muchos han visto el fracaso del movimiento popular hondureño en la causa de la resistencia sin entender que el materialismo histórico no es una formula matemática donde solo se cambian las variables , sino un medio para interpretar la realidad objetivamente .
Cuando se trata del análisis , es complicado salirse de “ moldes ” y comparaciones con esta o aquella experiencia previa .
Muchos incluso hablan de situación pre revolucionaria , como si el movimiento de las fuerzas sociales en un momento cualquiera se pudieran convertir en una especie de caldo que va alcanzando puntos de referencia específicos .
La realidad de la situación de los movimientos sociales hondure ños es bastante compleja , pero refleja claramente la lucha de clases entre la burguesía nacional y el proletariado .
Ahora bien conceptualizamos al proletariado como un conjunto de fuerzas diversas , no químicamente puro , donde participan obreros , campesinos ( que representan la mayoría de los trabajadores en el país ) , iglesias populares , profesionales , grupos feministas , estudiantes , maestros , y muchos mas .
Se ha dicho que la falta de organización y madurez de los movimientos populares ha sido factor clave para “ no poder aprovechar esta coyuntura para tomar el poder ” .
Se desconoce aquí que la madurez y organización de las fuerzas en resistencia no se mide por su capacidad de enfrentar al ejército esbirro del estado burgués y derrotarlo en el corto plazo .
Se mide por su capacidad de reacción y coordinación de las masas , algo que ha quedado demostrado desde el día mismo del golpe .
El hecho de que no todos los días salgamos en las noticias se relaciona mas con los criterios de “ noticia “ que fijan los medios de comunicación , que a la acción diaria del movimiento .
En Honduras se resiste diariamente , en todo el país .
Seria dogmatico pretender que tenemos un movimiento perfecto .
Es grandioso el esfuerzo que ha hecho la dirección nacional para mantener las masas alejadas de la reacción violenta .
Ha sido claro también que hay quienes prefieren tratar de tomar su propio camino y hacen actividades al margen de los planes de la resistencia ; otros que pasan mucho trabajo aceptando la dirección organizada .
Sin embargo , a medida ha ido creciendo el movimiento , la disciplina , la organización , la consciencia han ido e aumento .
Pasamos de la reacción a favor del líder a la necesidad clara de fundar un país nuevo .
En todo esto se ve claramente la dialéctica en la naturaleza de la resistencia y su camino a la victoria .
Pesimismo
Ahora en que consiste esta victoria ?
Muchos han afirmado que el resultado de esto terminará en un trise final mediatizado donde la dictadura y sus cómplices salen fortalecidos y el presidente atado de pies y manos , sin poder hacer nada .
Porque esta interpretación ?
Porque se afirma que esto termina con la venida o no del presidente constitucional ?
Este tipo de pesimismo se apega a viejas experiencias y subestima la capacidad del pueblo de seguir su lucha .
No parece muy científico poner “ términos fatales ” a los procesos sociales .
Los escenarios posibles en cuanto a lo que sucede en el corto plazo en el país son esencialmente dos : a ) el presidente vuelve y b ) el presidente no regresa a su cargo .
En ambos escenarios la lucha continua , pues el fin ultimo es la refundación de nuestra nación , no el retorno del presidente Zelaya .
Debe quedar claro que la etapa actual de la lucha impone la movilización por la reinstauración de la institucionalidad .
Esto se debe a que dejar pasar este golpe incólume seria un grave error en virtud del precedente que daría para el futuro de Honduras y de América Latina .
Parece claro que es la derecha imperial simpatiza con esta estrategia , señal de esto es el reconocimiento y respaldo de la empresa privada de Guatemala al régimen fascista hondureño , siendo este país sin duda alguna el próximo objetivo de la revuelta contra revolucionaria continental .
Asamblea Nacional Constituyente
La siguiente etapa se orienta a la conquista del poder para poder viabilizar una Asamblea Nacional Constituyente que redefina la legalidad del país .
Esta lucha seguirá la vía electoral debido , entre otras razones , a que tomar el camino de la lucha armada se traduciría en la legitimización de los argumentos de la derecha ; los medios imperiales tendrían mas fácil el trabajo de satanizar nuestro movimiento y aislarlo como han hecho con los movimiento armados colombianos .
En ningún caso las condiciones que se han dado en este país pueden considerarse una derrota .
Al contrario hemos ganado mucho , y eso se evidencia cada día más .
No se puede decir que esto llega tarde ; es simplemente un evento sucediendo en el momento que debe suceder .
Nuevamente , no es dialectico pensar que los movimientos revolucionarios suceden como una moda .
Si somos objetivos veremos que no existen momentos pre revolucionarios .
Las condiciones de lucha en honduras están planteadas en un proceso revolucionario cuyo objetivo es alcanzar una sociedad diferente , mas justa , mas equitativa , progresista y revolucionaria .
No debemos , local o internacionalmente , por los resultados que vemos en los diarios , o en la experiencia del día a día de esta revolución , que a veces parece subir el ánimo a veces causa gran escepticismo , caer en desesperanza .
El camino ahora esta trazado , y , pase lo que pase , lo vamos a seguir hasta la victoria final .

MANCHESTER , New Hampshire ( CNN ) --
If you listen to inventor Dean Kamen , the biggest health problem facing the world today is not AIDS , obesity or malnutrition .
It 's a shortage of water .
Dean Kamen hopes to tackle the world 's fresh water shortage with the Slingshot , a water purifying device .
Water is the most abundant resource on the planet , yet less than one percent of the Earth 's freshwater supply is readily available to drink , according to the World Health Organization .
Lack of accessible or clean drinking water , exacerbated by drought , is crippling communities in many developing countries .
" In your lifetime , my lifetime , we will see water be a really scarce , valuable commodity , " Kamen says .
Those are scary words from the man whose creations include the Segway personal motorized scooter and the Luke ( as in Skywalker ) prosthetic arm .
But the forward - thinking inventor and his team at DEKA Research in Manchester , New Hampshire , are n't sitting around waiting for the world 's wells to dry up .
They 've been working on an invention they say can tap into 97 percent of the world 's undrinkable water .
It 's called the Slingshot , and it's a portable , low energy machine that is designed to purify water in remote villages where there 's not a Wal - Mart in sight .
The device takes its name from a well - known story .
" We believe the world needs a slingshot to take care of its Goliath of a problem in water , " Kamen says .
" So we decided to build a small machine and give it to the little Davids . "
Perhaps you 've heard about the Slingshot , which Kamen has been working on for more than 10 years .
Over that time it has turned dirty river water , ocean water and even raw sewage into pure drinking water .
Kamen says it can turn anything that looks wet , or has water in it , into the " stuff of life . "
The magic behind the Slingshot is a " vapor compression distiller " that stands between what looks like two empty fish tanks connected by a couple of hoses .
One tank contains the contaminated liquid , the other is for the newly clean water .
Watch Kamen demonstrate the Slingshot »
The Slingshot boils , distills and vaporizes the polluted source , in turn delivering nothing but clean water to the other side .
And it does it all on less electricity than it takes to run a hair dryer .
In summer 2006 , Kamen delivered two Slingshots to the small community of Lerida in Honduras .
They were used for a month and Kamen says everything ran as planned .
" The machine worked very well down there , taking virtually any water that the people from that village brought to us , " he says .
" All the water that we got from the machine was absolutely pure water . "
But there 's a problem .
Kamen says each Slingshot costs his company several hundred thousand dollars to build .
He 's looking to partner with companies and organizations to distribute Slingshots around the world , but says a little more engineering work needs to be done in order to lower the production costs .
Kamen says the company would like to get the price down to about $ 2,000 per machine .
" The biggest challenge right now between this being a dream and a reality is getting committed people that really care about the state of the world 's health to get involved , " Kamen says .
The world 's population is quickly approaching 7 billion , making access to clean water that much more important .
According to the World Health Organization and UNICEF , more than 3.5 million people die every year from water - related diseases and almost 900 million do n't have access to a safe water supply .
Kamen says people in developing regions of the world need the Slingshot as soon as possible .
He also thinks the problem with polluted water will spread beyond small villages .
He says one Slingshot machine can supply about 250 gallons of water a day , which is enough for 100 people .
That 's a lot of Davids .
" It is literally like turning lead into gold , " he says .
" But I believe it 's more important , because you can't drink lead or gold . "

Greiner is one of a growing number of violin - makers catering for star soloists such as Tetzlaff and for the up - and - coming .
" We need great instruments , " Tetzlaff says .
" That 's the way the trade grows .
The great violinists from 1800 onwards always went back to the instruments by Stradivarius or Guarneri .
For the 19th - century makers , there was never the thrill of building for the best violinists , so they did n't have the incentive .
They were more like repairmen .
They would build instruments , but they would build for the lesser player .
There were quite a few good Italian instruments , but some of them have really died and are not playable any more .
Now all of a sudden there is a demand .
And so we go to the makers and say , sorry , we need a great instrument .
We do n't need something in between .

Why Susan 's still a winner : click here
Susan Boyle fans were in shock last night as she came second in the finals of Britain 's Got Talent .
She had topped off a tumultuous week with a superb performance singing the song that made her famous , “ I Dreamed A Dream ” from “ Les Miserables . "
Judge Piers Morgan hailed her song as “ the greatest performance ” in the reality competition ’s history .
“ That to me was the greatest performance I ’ve seen in ‘ Britain ’s Got Talent ’ history … you should win .
I loved it , ” Piers said .
But American Idol judge Simon Cowell thought differently .
He went for the dance troupe Diversity saying they were " the only act tonight I 'd give a ' 10 ' to . "
Maybe he thought so but they looked plain ordinary to us .
The guys who street dance outside the Public Library on 42nd Street do a better job .
Hell the subway riders on the # 4 train look better .
And Diversity sounded awful too .
Amanda Holden had been close to tears at Susa n't performance .
“ You did it , girl , you did it for Scotland , ” Amanda said adding that American Idol judge Simon had " a tear in his eye . ”
Cowell himself had paid tribute to Boyle 's determination saying he " absolutely adored " her .
" You could have walked away [ from the competition ] and you could have had a lot of stuff coming your way in America , ” Simon said .
“ Win or lose , you had the guts to come back here tonight , face your critics and you beat them and that ’s the most [ important ] thing … .
You can walk away with your head held high .
I absolutely adore you . ”
He said he was glad to have met the “ real Susan Boyle , ” who he described as “ a very nice , shy person who deserves a break . ”
Boyle , whose parents Patrick and Bridget both came from Ireland has said that the death of her mother had inspired her to enter the TV talent show .
" I wanted to show her I could do something with my life , " Boyle said .
No one can doubt that she has certainly accomplished that .
Diversity will probably become another one - win sensation while Boyle looks set for a new singing future .
However , they also walk away with about $ 159,000 and the chance to sing for the Queen of England .
One hardly need guess which act the Queen of England would have preferred !

A robot Elvis that mimics visitors ' movements was also on show Future directions of how people will interact with technology were on show at the Human Computer Interaction conference in Cambridge this week .
Much of the conference was dedicated to the finer details of human - computer interaction , such as how web pages are organised for optimal information presentation or the practicalities of cataloguing the web 's information using the " tags " familiar from social networking sites .
But at the conference 's Open House Festival , there were more than 70 demonstrations ranging from interactive - tabletop learning technologies to holographic projections and wireless - enabled scent - squirting jewellery .
THE BUZZ LEADING THE BLIND
See clearly - with your tongue
One novel experience to be had was that of " tummy vision " - an array of the vibrating motors found in mobile phones strapped to the stomach as part of a game .
Forty years ago , Paul Bach -y - Rita began a field of research known as sensory substitution .
His idea was that if a person was deprived of a sense such as sight or hearing , it could be " mapped " onto another .
His first incarnation of the idea was a dentist 's chair lined with hundreds of solenoids - small pins that jut out when a voltage is applied - each connected to a pixel of a camera .
A blind person could sit in the chair and images from the camera were transformed into patterns of the solenoids that the sitters could feel .
After tens of hours of training , people could be made to recognise images .
In 2001 , Professor Bach -y - Rita had developed a similar approach with electrodes arrayed across the tongue .
Fun and function
These days , researchers from the Open University 's e-Sense project have pared the idea back its most basic form , developing the " tummy vision " corset from cheap , off - the - shelf parts and programmed with open source software .
A camera tracks the progress of a participant 's gloved hand as well as that of ball rolled across the table .
The table is divided into 16 sections , each corresponding to one of the tiny mobile phone motors .
As the ball travels toward the blindfolded player , the vibrations track across the player 's abdomen , the object being to guess where to grab the ball before it rolls off the table .
Those trying it said it was fun - partly because the vibrations tickle - but crucially , the game can be mastered in just a few trials .
The kit is cheap , completely portable , and is already seeing applications elsewhere .
Already the researchers have adapted the system to guide violin students on the correct trajectory and speed of their bowing .
ONCE MORE , WITH FEELING
The functionality is not the only slick thing about touch - screens Another use of the vibrating motors is in mobiles themselves .
Many touchscreen handsets currently offer tactile feedback in the form of a simple mechanical buzz as virtual buttons are pushed .
But Stephen Brewster of the University of Glasgow has plans for the linear motors found in modern handsets .
They can be programmed to start off vibrating quickly or slowly , and at a wide range of frequencies .
Changing the nature of the vibration gives distinct feelings in a user 's fingertips , and Professor Brewster has replicated some familiar sensations through careful choice of vibration patterns and modulations .
On display was a simple touch screen with a few buttons .
The program within makes a " soft click " feel more like a computer keyboard , and a " hard click " has the satisfying response more akin to an old mobile phone keypad .
Eyes - free operation
The trick now , Professor Brewster said , was to replicate the overall feel of such a keypad .
" With old phones , you could reach in your pocket and feel the buttons ; if the phone rang you could answer it as you raised it to your ear , " he said .
" With my iPhone I 've got to look at it and do all sorts of things before I can answer a call . "
Professor Brewster 's team is fine - tuning the vibrations across the face of a touchscreen phone so that the feel mimics a proper keypad with its rounded keys raised in the middle , and with distinct shapes at different positions .
For example , sliding a finger along the screen from one virtual button to another prompts a short , light buzz that mimics the roughness of a real keyboard .
Getting the right combination for a touchscreen phone that really feels like a proper keypad is still a work in progress , said Prof Brewster .
A BRIGHT IDEA FOR SENSING
Can forgetful people now relax ?
Also on show was the SenseBulb , a light bulb with a standard fitting but with low - power , high - brightness LEDs inside , along with a great deal more technology .
Developed by Lyndsay Williams of Cambridge 's heads up Girton Labs , the device uses four sensors known as thermopiles - the same kind of detector found in heat - seeking missiles .
They sense temperature differences accurately and over a short time from a narrow angle .
Put one in the kitchen , for instance , and it wo n't register a pot boiling on the stove .
However , it would note that the oven was over its usual temperature , or that the fridge or the back door had remained open for a time .
With a SIM card built in , it can be set up to send text messages automatically to a specified recipient whenever temperatures in a given part of the home fall out of a set range .
The thermopile sensors could even , Ms Williams said , register the waving of arms - and for this reason she said it could be an unobtrusive and passive movement sensor for Alzheimer 's patients or elderly people who live alone .

Finance & Development ,
The recovery has started .
Sustaining it will require delicate rebalancing acts , both within and across countries
Olivier Blanchard
PDF version
IN normal recessions , however disruptive they are to businesses and jobs , things turn around predictably .
The current global recession is far from normal .
Usually , to fight a recession , the central bank lowers interest rates , which results in increased demand and output .
People resume buying durable goods such as appliances and cars .
Firms start delayed investment projects .
Often , an exchange rate depreciation gives a boost to exports by making them cheaper .
The lower - than - normal growth during the recession gives way to higher - than - normal growth for some time , until the economy has returned to its normal growth path .
But the world is not in a run -of - the - mill recession .
The turnaround will not be simple .
The crisis has left deep scars , which will affect both supply and demand for many years to come .
Supply - side problems
Some parts of the economic system have broken .
Some firms went bankrupt that would not have in a normal recession .
In advanced countries , the financial systems are partly dysfunctional , and will take a long time to find their new shape .
Meanwhile , financial intermediation — and , by implication , the process of reallocation of resources that is central to growth — will be impaired .
In emerging market countries , capital inflows , which decreased dramatically during the crisis , may not fully come back in the next few years .
Changes in the composition of world demand , as consumption shifts from advanced to emerging economies , may require changes in the structure of production .
In nearly all countries , the costs of the crisis have added to the fiscal burden , and higher taxation is inevitable .
All this means that we may not go back to the old growth path , that potential output may be lower than it was before the crisis .
How much has potential output decreased ?
It is difficult to tell : we do not see potential output , only actual output .
The historical evidence is worrisome , however .
The IMF ’s forthcoming World Economic Outlook presents evidence from 88 banking crises over the past four decades in a wide range of countries .
While there is large variation across countries , the conclusion is that , on average , output does not go back to its old trend path , but remains permanently below it .
The possible good news is that the trend itself appears to be unaffected : on average , crises permanently decrease the level of output , but not its growth rate .
So , if past is prologue , the world economy likely will return to its past growth rate .
But , especially in advanced countries , the period of above - average growth , characteristic of normal recoveries , may be short - lived or nonexistent .
Demand - side issues
Just achieving “ normal ” growth , however , may be hard because of demand problems .
The forecasts now predict that growth will be positive in most countries , including advanced countries , for the next few quarters .
But there are two caveats to this news :
Growth will not be quite strong enough to reduce unemployment , which is not expected to crest until some time next year .
These positive growth forecasts are largely predicated on a combination of a fiscal stimulus and inventory rebuilding by firms , rather than on strong private consumption and fixed investment spending .
Sooner or later , the fiscal stimulus will have to be phased out .
And inventory adjustment will also naturally come to an end .
The question , then , is what will sustain the recovery .
Two rebalancing acts will have to come into play .
First , rebalancing from public to private spending .
Second , rebalancing aggregate demand across countries , with a shift from domestic to foreign demand in the United States and a reverse shift from foreign to domestic demand in the rest of the world , particularly in Asia .
Rebalancing public and private spending
The fiscal response to the crisis was to increase government spending , lower taxes , and accept much larger fiscal deficits .
Given the collapse of private demand , and the inability to reduce interest rates below zero , governments clearly chose the right response .
But large deficits lead to rapid increases in debt , and , because debt levels were already high in many countries , such increases cannot go on for long .
As large deficits continue , debt sustainability comes increasingly into question .
And with this comes the risk of higher long - term interest rates , both because of anticipated crowding out of private borrowers by government borrowers and because of a higher risk of default .
How much longer can the fiscal stimulus continue ?
On its own , in most advanced countries , probably not very long .
The average ratio of debt to gross domestic product ( GDP ) for the G - 20 advanced economies was high before the crisis , and is forecast to exceed 100 percent in the next few years .
( The situation is substantially different in a number of emerging market countries , where debt was much lower to start , and where there is more room for deficit spending . )
An important qualifier is “ on its own . ”
The stimulus can be prolonged if , at the same time , structural measures are taken to limit the future growth of entitlement programs — whether from rising health care costs or from the effect of aging populations on retirement costs .
The trade - off is fairly attractive .
IMF estimates suggest that the fiscal cost of future increases in entitlements is 10 times the fiscal cost of the crisis .
Thus , even a modest cut in the growth rate of entitlement programs can buy substantial fiscal space for continuing stimulus .
Eventually , however , the fiscal stimulus will have to be phased out , and private demand must replace it .
The source of that demand — whether consumption or investment — is a crucial issue .
Rebalancing demand across countries
The United States was not only at the origin of the crisis , it is central to any world recovery .
Consumption represents 70 percent of total U.S. demand , and its decline was the main near - term cause of the fall in output in this crisis .
The ratio of U.S. household saving to disposable income , which was close to zero in 2007 , has increased to about 5 percent .
Will the saving rate go back to its 2007 level ?
That would not be desirable , and is unlikely .
On the one hand , some of the increase in saving in the last year probably reflected a wait - and - see attitude on the part of consumers , an attitude that will go away as the smoke clears .
On the other hand , the saving rate tends to go up as output and income expand .
And even if financial wealth returned to its pre-crisis level — be it in housing ( which seems undesirable and unlikely ) or in stocks — and output returned to its trend path , U.S. consumers would still probably save more .
The reason is that the crisis has made them more conscious of tail risks — events that are unlikely to occur but , when they do , have devastating consequences .
Before the crisis , it was an article of faith that housing prices rarely , if ever , decreased ( a belief that was a main contributor to the crisis ) .
Another article of faith , one backed by stronger historical evidence , was that investors could count on stocks yielding an annual rate of return of 6 percent .
Last year ’s decline in the stock market showed that those yields cannot be taken for granted , and that more saving may be needed to ensure a safe retirement .
Thus , U.S. consumers are likely to save more , at least until they forget the lessons of the crisis .
The best guess ( and there is little more to go on ) is that the U.S. household saving rate will remain at least at its current level .
That means a 5 percentage point decline in the ratio of consumption to disposable income relative to the pre-crisis period , or about a 3 percentage point drop in the ratio of consumption to GDP .
Put simply , 3 percent more of U.S. aggregate demand will have to come from something other than consumption .
Will it be from investment ?
This also seems unlikely .
Housing investment , as a percentage of GDP , was too high in the years preceding the crisis , and it will take a long time to get rid of the backlog of houses .
Until that happens , housing investment will be low .
Will fixed investment , again as a percentage of GDP , be higher after the crisis than it was before ?
Probably not .
Capacity utilization is at a historical low , and will take a long time to recover .
While banks may be solvent now , they are still tightening credit , and tight lending standards are likely to last a while .
Less - efficient financial intermediation will affect not only the supply side , but also the demand side .
Again , historical evidence from “ creditless ” recoveries suggests that investment will be weak for a long time .
Can low interest rates help ?
It is likely that , at any given interest rate , U.S. private domestic demand will be weak for a long time , weaker than it was before the crisis .
Note , however , the qualifier “ at any given interest rate . ”
This appears to offer room for some optimism .
The short - term riskless rate is lower now than it was in the pre-crisis years .
Over the three years before the crisis , the average nominal U.S. treasury bill rate was 4 percent , while the average inflation rate was 3 percent .
That resulted in a real — that is , after - inflation — rate of 1 percent .
Today , the treasury bill rate is roughly zero and inflation expectations appear anchored around 2 percent .
That implies a real rate of around – 2 percent — that is , 3 percentage points below its pre-crisis level .
The Federal Reserve can leave the policy rate — the federal funds rate — at zero if it needs to , and , because inflation expectations are more likely to increase than to decrease , real rates are likely to remain negative .
An old rule of thumb is that a 1 percentage point lower real rate that is expected to remain so for some time leads to a roughly 1 percent increase in aggregate demand .
A decrease in the real rate of 3 percentage points would seem sufficient to offset the caution of consumers and firms and sustain the recovery .
But it may not be .
What matters for demand is the rate at which consumers and firms can borrow , not the policy rate itself .
As was clear during this crisis , the rate at which consumers and firms borrow often is a lot higher than the policy rate .
Risk premiums on U.S. BBB - rated bonds , for example , are nearly 3 percentage points higher than before the crisis .
This higher risk perception may well be an enduring legacy of the crisis .
( The Great Depression led to a large increase in the risk premium on stocks , which lasted for the better part of four decades .
But the Depression lasted a long time , and this crisis appears unlikely to have the same psychological impact . )
Higher risk premiums , then , could undo , at least in part , lower policy rates .
U.S. policymakers cannot count on low interest rates alone to deliver a sustained U.S. recovery .
Can Asia help ?
If the U.S. recovery is to take place , if the fiscal stimulus must be phased out , and if private domestic demand is weak , then U.S. net exports must increase .
In other words , the U.S. current account deficit must decrease .
That means that the rest of the world , now in substantial surplus , must reduce that current account surplus .
Where should this reduction come from ?
It is natural to look first at the countries with large current account surpluses .
Among them , most prominently , are Asian countries .
And most prominent among them is China .
From the point of view of the United States , a decrease in China ’s current account surplus would help increase demand and sustain the U.S. recovery .
That would result in more imports from the United States , which would help sustain world recovery .
Why might China be willing to go along ?
Because it may well be in its own interest : China ’s growth has been based on an export - led growth model that relies on a high saving rate , leading to low internal demand , and a low exchange rate , leading to high external demand .
The model has been highly successful , but is leading to the accumulation of extremely large reserves , and pressure is building to increase consumption .
The high rate of saving reflects the lack of social insurance and the resulting high precautionary saving by households , limited access of households to credit , and governance issues in firms that lead them to retain too high a proportion of their earnings .
Providing more social insurance , increasing household access to credit , and improving firms ’ governance are all desirable on their own , and would lead to both lower saving and higher internal demand .
If such an expansion of demand runs into supply - side constraints , this higher internal demand would have to be partly offset by lower external demand , meaning an appreciation of the Chinese renminbi ( RMB ) at least in real terms .
Both higher Chinese import demand and a higher RMB would increase U.S. net exports .
Other emerging market Asian countries also run large current account surpluses .
Their motivations vary — some want to accumulate reserves as insurance , others chose an export - led growth strategy that incidentally affects the current account and reserve accumulation .
Many of these countries could decrease saving , public or private ( as the dramatic decline in household saving in Korea since the 1990s demonstrates ) , and allow their currency to appreciate .
That would lead to a shift from external to internal demand and to a reduction in their current account surplus .
Their incentives , however , are weaker than China’s .
Having substantial reserves has proved very useful in the crisis .
Swap lines from central banks , and multilateral credit lines — such as the “ flexible credit line ” created by the IMF during the crisis — could reduce the demand for reserves .
But swap lines and credit lines might not be renewed , and so do not offer quite the same degree of safety as reserves .
( Establishing arrangements to substantially reduce reserve accumulation would also both be highly desirable in the long run and help to sustain the recovery in the short and the medium run . )
Thus , countries that have adopted an export - led growth model may reassess that policy and give more weight to internal demand , but any change is likely to be gradual .
To get a sense of magnitudes , another rough computation is useful .
The GDP of emerging Asia is roughly 50 percent of U.S. GDP ( with the ratio projected to increase to 70 percent in 2014 ) .
So , if all their trade was with the United States , Asian countries would have to lower their current account position by 4 percent of GDP to improve the U.S. current account by , say , 2 percent of GDP ( under the assumption of a 3 percent shortfall in the ratio of consumption to GDP , minus a 1 percent increase coming from lower real interest rates ) .
Since emerging Asia ’s trade is not all with the United States , the adjustment would likely have to be even larger .
This raises the question of whether other countries can and should play a role .
What role for non-Asian countries ?
A number of other countries , including some advanced countries , also have current account surpluses .
For example , Germany ’s surplus for 2008 is half China ’s ( although it is shrinking fast ) ; Japan ’s surplus is one - third of China’s .
Should Germany , for example , reduce its surplus ?
It can not follow the same route as that suggested for China — that is , a currency appreciation accompanied by a decrease in saving .
Because it is part of the euro area , Germany cannot engineer an appreciation on its own .
And , on the demand side , it suffers largely from the same problem as the United States : it has limited room on the fiscal side , and it is not clear that it is either desirable or feasible to get German consumers to save less .
Germany could , however , improve productivity in its nontradable sector , which would be in its interest .
This would , in time , lead to a reallocation of demand toward nontradables and reduce its current account surplus .
The same argument applies to Japan .
But , because such structural reforms are politically difficult , and because their effects take place slowly , it is likely to be a slow process — too slow to provide substantial support to the recovery over the next few years .
So , if rebalancing is to come soon , it probably has to come largely from Asia , through a decrease in saving and an appreciation of Asian currencies vis -à - vis the dollar .
What if rebalancing does not happen ?
This tour of the world suggests three conclusions :
First , the crisis is likely to have led to a decrease in potential output .
One should not expect very high growth rates in the recovery .
Second , sustained recovery in the United States and elsewhere eventually requires rebalancing from public to private spending .
Third , sustained recovery is likely to require an increase in U.S. net exports and a corresponding decrease in the rest of the world , coming mainly from Asia .
One can question all three conclusions .
On the supply side , the effect on potential output is highly uncertain .
After all , despite the pessimistic historical evidence , some countries have emerged from banking crises without experiencing a visible impact on potential output ( on the other hand , though , some countries have seen a long - lasting negative impact not only on the level of GDP , but also on its growth rate ) .
On the demand side , the fiscal space in advanced countries may be larger than expected , allowing the United States to sustain longer - lasting deficits and a higher debt level than currently forecast without raising market concerns about debt sustainability .
If this is the case , rebalancing private and public spending can be phased in more slowly if needed , allowing more time to achieve a rebalancing of world demand .
Alternatively , private demand in the United States may be stronger : U.S. consumers could return to their old ways and save less .
That would help the recovery and avoid the need for a major adjustment of net exports , although it would re-create in the longer run some of the problems that caused the current crisis .
Or it could be that the world decouples — that Asia , for example , is able to return to high growth , while recovery in advanced countries falters .
But the crisis , and the strong export links that turned a U.S. shock into a world recession , suggests that decoupling , although possible , is unlikely .
If , however , one accepts the argument that both rebalancing acts are likely to be necessary for a sustained recovery , the next question is whether they will take place .
It is clear that they may not , at least not on the scale needed .
If , for example , Asia is unwilling to reduce its current account surplus and U.S. net exports do not substantially improve , weak U.S. private demand may lead to an anemic U.S. recovery .
In that case , there would likely be strong political pressure to extend the fiscal stimulus until private demand has recovered .
Were that to happen , one can imagine various scenarios : political pressure may be resisted , the fiscal stimulus could be phased out , and the U.S. recovery might falter .
Or fiscal deficits might be maintained for too long , leading to issues of debt sustainability and worries about U.S. government bonds and the dollar , and causing large capital flows from the United States .
Dollar depreciation may take place , but in a disorderly fashion , leading to another episode of instability and high uncertainty , which could itself derail the recovery .
Sustaining the nascent recovery is likely to require delicate rebalancing acts , both within and across countries .
An understanding of the issues and the dangers , and some coordination across countries , is likely to be as crucial during the next few years as it was during the most intense part of the crisis .

Simple And Cheap
Like all netbooks , the Acer Aspire One is a simple and cheap mini laptop , great for working and browsing the web on the go .
They are so small and light that they literally beg to be carried and used outdoors !
It is for that very reason that I prefer buying netbooks that use SSDs ( solid state drive ) .
With a solid state drive , I can literally drop the netbook and not worry about it dying on me .
The debate between solid state drives and hard disk drives aside , netbooks offer a really light and tight package at low prices to boot .
It 's little wonder why sales of netbooks are increasing even in these dire times .
However , netbooks do have some disadvantages , one of which being the increased difficulty or even impossibility of upgrading it .
This is due to the highly integrated nature of the components , a necessity in keeping the size small and the price low .
Some things just can't be upgraded , e.g. the addition of a DVD drive .
Other components like the system memory and WiFi module can be upgraded , but with some difficulty .
This is why we came up with this guide .
It shows you how to properly disassemble the Acer Aspire One netbook so that you can upgrade it .
You will require some knowledge and experience working with computer hardware .
If you are used to installing and troubleshooting your own PCs , then you should be in familiar territory .
What Do You Require ?
First , you will need an Acer Aspire One netbook , of course .
We used the Acer Aspire One A110 model which comes with an 8 GB solid state drive , but most Acer Aspire
One netbook models have similar internal layouts even if they look quite different .
You will also need :
A 2 mm Phillips head screwdriver
A flat head screwdriver with a 3 mm tip .
A bowl or container ( to retain screws and other loose components )
If you wish , you can cover the screwdriver tip with a piece of cellophane tape so it wo n't scratch the netbook 's paint job .
Be sure to prepare a container of some sort .
A bowl works great .
There will be plenty of screws later so you need a container to keep them safe or you risk losing them .
Although it is not necessary , prepare a digital camera if you have one handy .
It is a good idea to take shots of every step you take so you do not forget the position of each screw / component that you remove .
It will make reassembling the Aspire One netbook a much easier and safer process if your Acer Aspire
One model has some minor differences internally with the model we are showing in this guide .
If you have everything ready , then let 's get right down to it !

“ Pimp my Prius ” is pretty much a cliche by now but somehow it never seems to get old .
And it seems the effort to transform this fuel - sipping suburban transport into a vehicle that looks like it should be competing in Formula Drift , wo n’t fizzle out either .
Japanese tuning shop Tommy Kaira is the latest shop to take a crack at the 2010 Toyota Prius with the release of a new mod package .
Admittedly , at first glance , I almost did n’t recognize the third - generation hybrid sitting beneath its new performance garb .
Thousands of hours of wind tunnel testing go out the window with the addition of a new front lip spoiler , air intakes , side sills , revised bumper and rear side fenders .
The addition of some new vertical lights up front and a quad - pipe exhaust in back are a nice touch .
The Tommy Kaira Prius also benefits from larger diameter wheels and a lowered ride height .
If I could forget about the fact that this is a low - performance , high - efficiency hybrid vehicle ( which I can ’t ) then the Tommy Kaira body kit and customization package might be considered spot-on .
In fact , if this setup was for a R34 Skyline I would say ‘ bravo ’ .
However , the sheer amount of cognitive dissonance experienced from driving a car that looks like it could smoke an Evo but can hardly keep up with a 1988 Astro Van would drive me crazy .
If you just want a really cool looking Prius , we say go for the Tommy Kaira modification package .
We applaud the aesthetics and commend this company for being one of the early adopters of eco-tuning .
But if you are practical ( and you must be because you bought a Prius ) then you realize that you wo n’t be able to get up to any speed where the aerodynamic mods will actually be able to assist you in any way .
In fact , you will most likely decrease your fuel efficiency ( more drag + more weight ) .
And when you pull into your driveway and tear the front lip off your dropped Prius , you ’ll be pissed .
[ ASI Toyota Prius ]
Our recommendation , if you have extra money you want to spend on your Toyota Prius , why do n’t you pick up a photovoltaic kit that adds to your mileage instead of eating away at it .
There will be a time when tuning and performance mods for hybrids follow along the lines of their petrol siblings but we just are n’t there yet …

Lately we 've been busy bees in Mountain View , as you can see from the recent release of Android 1.6 to the open - source tree , not to mention some devices we 're working on with partners that we think you 'll really like .
Of course , the community is n't sitting around either , and we 've been seeing some really cool and impressive things , such as the custom Android builds that are popular with many enthusiasts .
Recently there 's been some discussion about an exchange we had with the developer of one of those builds , and I 've noticed some confusion around what is and is n't part of Android 's open source code .
I want to take a few moments to clear up some of those misconceptions , and explain how Google 's apps for Android fit in .
Everyone knows that mobile is a big deal , but for a long time it was hard to be a mobile app developer .
Competing interests and the slow pace of platform innovation made it hard to create innovative apps .
For our part , Google offers a lot of services — such as Google Search , Google Maps , and so on — and we found delivering those services to users ' phones to be a very frustrating experience .
But we also found that we were n't alone , so we formed the Open Handset Alliance , a group of like - minded partners , and created Android to be the platform that we all wished we had .
To encourage broad adoption , we arranged for Android to be open - source .
Google also created and operates Android Market as a service for developers to distribute their apps to Android users .
In other words , we created Android because the industry needed an injection of openness .
Today , we 're thrilled to see all the enthusiasm that developers , users , and others in the mobile industry have shown toward Android .
With a high - quality open platform in hand , we then returned to our goal of making our services available on users ' phones .
That 's why we developed Android apps for many of our services like YouTube , Gmail , Google Voice , and so on .
These apps are Google 's way of benefiting from Android in the same way that any other developer can , but the apps are not part of the Android platform itself .
We make some of these apps available to users of any Android - powered device via Android Market , and others are pre-installed on some phones through business deals .
Either way , these apps are n't open source , and that 's why they are n't included in the Android source code repository .
Unauthorized distribution of this software harms us just like it would any other business , even if it 's done with the best of intentions .
I hope that clears up some of the confusion around Google 's apps for Android .
We always love seeing novel uses of Android , including custom Android builds from developers who see a need .
I look forward to seeing what comes next !

First and foremost , you need to educate your amygdala .
When somebody comes at you with hostile language , your amygdala typically says , " DANGER ! RED ALERT ! " , and off you go .
You need to be able to change the criteria your amygdala has for defining a threat .
Advertisement

Suppose a two - year - old runs at you screaming " YOU BIG MEANY !
I do n't LIKE you ! " and starts pounding on your knees with tiny fists .
Your amygdala does n't pay the slightest attention .
You know the toddler is no threat to you , you understand what causes such episodes , and you have better sense than to get involved in a fight with the poor little kid .
The key here is that you understand what 's going on , and that lets you stay detached and rational .
With verbal attackers , the problem is that we usually do n't understand what 's going on .
The dominant idea about such people in our culture is that their goal in attacking you verbally is to hurt you , to cause you pain , to do you harm -- and that does of course fit your amygdala 's specifications for danger .
However , the idea is all wrong .
It 's a myth , just as " Sticks and stones will break your bones but words will never hurt you " is a myth .
Anybody can verbally attack once in a while .
You 're over - tired , you 've had a horrible day , you 're coming down with a bad cold , somebody says a few innocuous words at you , and you lose it -- you go after them as if they 'd approached you swinging an axe .
But chronic verbal attackers -- the ones that keep everybody around them in turmoil all the time , the ones that people will flee into a restroom to avoid when they see them coming down the hall -- are different .
Sure , they could be sadistic psychotics out to savage you , but that 's not likely ( and if they are , there 'll be other clues , such as the fact that they are swinging an axe ) .
Almost always , chronic verbal abusers behave the way they do for one of two reasons :
A small percentage are simply klutzes .
They 're ignorant .
They know no other way to communicate with other human beings .
All they need is education .
As for the rest , they 're desperate for attention and they know that throwing hostile language at you will get your attention .
In both cases , once you understand what 's really going on , your reaction to such people will no longer be , " Danger !
Red alert ! "
Your reaction will be compassion .
As in " Poor thing .
Desperate to communicate , and that 's the best he / she can do . "
Or " Poor thing .
Desperate for attention , and that 's the best he / she can do . "
You still may not like the attacker and you 'll still find the attacker 's behavior unacceptable , but you wo n't have any interest in arguing .
Listening instead of leaping to conclusions
Psychologist George Miller long ago said something so important that I call it Miller 's Law ; he said , " In order to understand what another person is saying , you must assume that it is true and try to find out what it could be true of . "
That is , when somebody says , " Hey !
My toaster talks to me ! " , your proper response is a neutral " Oh ?
What does your toaster say ? "
Followed by careful listening , with your full attention .
You 're not accepting as true the statement that the person 's toaster talks to him or her ; you 're assuming temporarily that it is true , and then you 're listening carefully to find out what the statement could be true of .
That 's not how most of us operate .
Most of us use a rule that I call Miller 's Law In Reverse .
We hear somebody say something that we react to negatively ; we immediately assume that the utterance is false ; and we stop listening because we 're busy telling ourselves what 's wrong with the person that explains why they 'd say something so unacceptable to us .
We leap to conclusions .
We tell ourselves things like these :
" He 's only saying that because .... he 's uneducated / crazy / drunk / old/ sadistic / showing off . "
" She 's only saying that because .... she 's an airhead / vicious / on drugs / totally confused / out to get me . "
" They 're only saying that because ...
I 'm short / people like them have no manners / I can't afford a decent suit / they do n't like me . "
The minute we do that , all listening stops .
You can't listen to what someone else is saying and listen to your own self - talk at the same time ; it 's not neurophysiologically possible .
And what happens next ?
A great deal of the time , a fight happens .
Like this :
X : " Hey !
My toaster talks to me ! "
YOU : " Look , I do n't have time for that kind of garbage !
I 've got work to do ! "
X : " And I suppose MY work is n't as important as yours ? "
YOU : " I did n't say that . "
X : " Oh , yes you did ! "
YOU : " I did NOT !
I just said ... "
And so on , downhill from there .
People tell me they do n't have time to listen , they 're too busy .
I can assure you , based on three decades of teaching verbal self - defense , that they spend far more time straightening out the messes that result from not listening .
Give the speaker your full attention for as long as it takes to understand what 's really being said and why .
Even if the speaker is a child .
Perhaps especially if the speaker is a child .
I once heard a mother answer a child 's " Mom , I wish I was dead " with " Were dead , dear , not was dead . "
This is how we end up reading in newspapers that a child has done some terrrible thing " without warning . "
This is what 's behind going home one night and finding that your spouse has left you " without warning . "
There 's always a warning , but somebody has to be listening to it ; otherwise , the person will give up and stop trying .
Knowing how to respond
Our culture teaches three standard ways to respond to a verbal attack :
Attacking back - " How DARE you say that to me ! "
Pleading - " I ca n't BELIEVE you 're going to start that again when you KNOW how much work I have to do today ! "
Debating - " There are three reasons why what you say is ridiculous .
First ... "
All three are strategic errors , because all three reward the attacker by providing your immediate full attention , often with an emotional reaction thrown in that increases the intensity of that attention .
All you do when you use those three traditional responses is encourage the attacker to do it again .
After all , it worked .
What you need is a response that does n't do this .
You need a response that lets the attacker know you wo n't serve as willing victim .
Fleeing the scene wo n't do it ; fleeing makes it obvious to attackers that they " got to you " ; they 'll be eager to try again .
Silently ignoring attackers wo n't serve either ; in our culture , silence is punishment , and is just another kind of counterattack .
Like fleeing , it says , " You got to me .
You can push my buttons . "
The verbal self - defense system that I teach includes an array of techniques too large to fit in this brief article .
But I can give you two examples here ( and you can find more information in my books or at my verbal self - defense Web site , http://www.adrr.com/aa/).
Your goal is to respond to hostile language in a way that does n't set you up as a victim , does n't reward the attacker , does n't require you to sacrifice your principles or dignity , and causes no loss of face on either side .

Technology has made modern vessels very efficient at landing fish
There is fresh hope that the world 's depleted fisheries can be saved from collapse , says a team of researchers .
They said that efforts introduced to halt overfishing in five of the 10 large marine ecosystems they examined were showing signs of success .
A combination of measures - such as catch quotas , no - take zones , and selective fishing gear - had helped fish stocks recover , they added .
Details of the two - year study by 21 marine scientists appear in Science .
However , the team warned , a large percentage of the world 's fisheries remained unmanaged , so much work still had to be done to halt the damage caused by overfishing .
Optimistic outlook
The authors said the study , which looked at key fisheries in Europe , North America and New Zealand , had two goals :
The first was to examine current trends in fish stocks , while the second was to identify what tools had been used in attempts to replenish fish numbers .
Fisheries that are tightly managed are showing signs of recovery " This was a little like a crime scene investigation for overfishing , " said lead author Boris Worm , a marine biologist from Dalhousie University , Canada .
" We wanted to find out what were the tools that had been used to adjust exploitation rates and reduce the pressure on fish stocks , " said Dr Worm .
" This allowed us to perform not only a much more in - depth assessment of fishery trends , but also - for the first time - to quantify the trends of exploitation rates , which is the proportion of fish removed from the ecosystem each year , " explained Dr Worm .
" This is really quite a big step forward because the exploitation rate is the primary driver of depletion and collapse , just as CO2 is the primary driver of climate change . "
However , he added that the exploitation rate was the one factor that could be adjusted by direct human intervention , such as introducing management practices .
The authors observed : " Some of the most spectacular rebuilding efforts have involved bold experimentation with closed areas , [ fishing ] gear restrictions and new approaches to catch allocations and enforcement . "
But they warned that the signs of recovery should not be interpreted by policymakers as a sign that all was well beneath the waves .
The majority of fisheries were still in trouble , and were not being managed or regulated properly .
But Dr Worm said that the team 's " watershed paper " offered a blueprint for sustainable fishing .
" It clearly shows what needs to be done to not only avoid fisheries collapse , but to actually rebuild fish stocks and ecosystems . "

The U.S. Census Bureau does n’t ask questions about religion because of political issues involving separation of church and state , so we do n’t always get a very detailed view of religion .
The Glenmary Research Center does collect this data , however .
The Valparaiso geography department maps this detailed data , and the extensive collection of choropleth maps can be found here .

Presenting a brand - spanking - new feature here at Unleashed : " Don't. Just Don't . "
Here , we 'll cover all the ill - advised ideas we silly humans have for dealing with animals .
Generally speaking , they do n't turn out well .
For example :
A Boynton Beach , Fla. , man told police that he'd been trying to teach his ill - mannered cat a lesson when he carried it to his garage , where he fired his handgun into a flotation device .
The resulting noise , apparently , was intended to scare the animal in an effort to convince it to do its business in the litter box ( desired ) rather than on the bed ( where it apparently left a mess , causing the unfortunate firearm business ) .
The Associated Press reports that the cat was uninjured in the incident , but its owner is being held on a $ 5,000 bond after being charged with firing in an occupied residence ( obvious ) and using a firearm while under the influence ( even more obvious ) .
No word on whether the cat was removed from his care .

A previously rejected iPhone title offering emulated play of Commodore 64 titles has been approved after the developer made changes to align it with Apple 's SDK .
It allows the iPhone to act as a system that was what was once Apple 's staunch competitor .
According to a report by TouchArcade , Manomio's $ 4.99 C64 title was rejected in June despite having lined up all the proper licensing rights .
The sticking point for Apple appeared to have be the inclusion of the Commodore BASIC 2.0 interpreter , which would enable the app to execute arbitrary code .
The iPhone 2.0 SDK specifically limited apps from containing their own executable runtimes in a clause that stated :
" An Application may not itself install or launch other executable code by any means , including without limitation through the use of a plug - in architecture , calling other frameworks , other APIs or otherwise .
No interpreted code may be downloaded and used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Appleâs Published APIs and built - in interpreter ( s ) . "
That element of the SDK baring the launch of other executable code brought the approval of any type of emulator into question , as the sole purpose of an emulator is to act as another platform in order to run programs designed for it .
Emulators vs. the SDK
The main point of Apple 's SDK restriction appears to be the company 's desire to prevent its own Cocoa Touch platform from being sidelined by a third party developer 's sub-platform , such as Java , Adobe Flash , or Microsoft Silverlight .
If developers want to ship apps for Apple 's iPhone , they have to use Apple 's APIs .
There are also security implications involved .
Most of the highly publicized vulnerabilities that are counted against Mac OS X's security are actually flaws in the third - party runtimes it bundles , particularly Java and Flash .
At WWDC , Apple cited ' web plugins ' as the primary reason for crashes under Leopard , clearly fingering Flash .
Any capacity to run code is a potential vector for malware or a vulnerability exploit .
Additionally , the ability to run external titles would not only allow developers to subvert the App Store approvals process , but could also open up the iPhone to widespread piracy , a problem that would not only undermine the success of the App Store itself but also expose Apple to copyright infringement claims from intellectual property holders in the same way Napster was sued for making the distribution of pirated media available .
In App Purchase
Apple addressed the friction between emulator titles and sub-platform limitations in iPhone 3.0 via in app purchasing , a new feature in iPhone 3.0 .
This enables developers to package additional elements to enhance their apps and sell them separately .
In Manomio's case , its C64 package includes the emulator and five game titles : Dragon 's Den , Le Mans , Jupiter Lander , Arctic Shipwreck , and Jack Attack .
Additional games are expected to be released as in app purchases as they become available .
The app will not load arbitrary game code downloads nor expose a BASIC interpreter .
The booting emulator screen displays a screen that says " BASIC is disabled in this version .
Do n't despear [ sic ] !
It should be resolved in a future update . "
Whether the company meant " despair " or " disappear , " other developers will be closely watching to see how Apple interprets its SDK in allowing its state of the art smartphone platform to act as an emulator for previous generations of titles .
Return of the Commodore 64
Somewhat ironically the Commodore 64 , which debuted in 1982 , wildly outsold Apple 's own offering at the time : the Apple IIe , which at $ 1200 cost twice as much .
Commodore brought its computer to the public using toy and department stores at a time when Apple and IBM were wedded to networks of authorized dealers .
A significant part of Apple 's recent success comes from its direct retail initiatives .
Commodore also helped pioneer the concept of bundling in ports for a ready - to use system as opposed to the existing Apple II line , which presented the user with eight expansion slots but only a few built - in ports .
While Apple 's expansion potential was touted as a feature , few owners really needed it .
This may have influenced Steve Jobs ' view of the personal computer , as all subsequent computers from Apple , including the Macintosh , moved away from the open - ended PC design toward a ready - to - use system aimed at the mass market .
Jobs ' return to Apple in the mid 90s refocused the company on the new iMac and moved away from the PC - like " Power Express " boxes with lots of slots that were then on the ailing company 's drawing board .
Today , Apple 's notebook line has virtually no expansion options , particularly with the replacement of the seldom used ExpressCard slot with an SD card reader on mainstream models .
The consumer - oriented iMac and Mac mini also continue to offer no general purpose expansion slots , although most modern peripherals have standardized on specifications such as USB or FireWire , greatly reducing the need for general purpose expansion slots .
Proving yet again that there is no limit to the extent to which the Federal Government will intrude upon our lives , the Feds are now turning their attention to that staple of American Suburbia , the garage sale :
WASHINGTON —
If you ’re planning a garage sale or organizing a church bazaar , you ’d best beware :
You could be breaking a new federal law .
As part of a campaign called Resale Roundup , the federal government is cracking down on the secondhand sales of dangerous and defective products .
The initiative , which targets toys and other products for children , enforces a new provision that makes it a crime to resell anything that ’s been recalled by its manufacturer .
“ Those who resell recalled children ’s products are not only breaking the law , they are putting children ’s lives at risk , ” said Inez Tenenbaum , the recently confirmed chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission .
The crackdown affects sellers ranging from major thrift - store operators such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army to everyday Americans cleaning out their attics for yard sales , church bazaars or — increasingly — digital hawking on eBay , Craigslist and other Web sites .
Secondhand sellers now must keep abreast of recalls for thousands of products , some of them stretching back more than a decade , to stay within the bounds of the law .
Staffers for the federal agency are fanning out across the country to conduct training seminars on the regulations at dozens of thrift shops .
WASHINGTON --
The White House will shelve Bush administration plans to build a missile - defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic , according to people familiar with the matter , a move likely to cheer Moscow and roil the security debate in Europe .
The U.S. will base its decision on a determination that Iran 's long - range missile program has not progressed as rapidly as previously estimated , reducing the threat to the continental U.S. and major European capitals , according to current and former U.S. officials .

Note : References below are to Harvey Mansfield ’s translation of The Prince , Second Edition , University of Chicago Press .
I am a student of Leo Paul de Alvarez and cannot recommend his ( de Alvarez ’s ) work highly enough : if you can buy his edition of The Prince , do so , especially as the essay he has written introducing the work will be of enormous help for those interested in distinguishing political science today from its origins .
If you feel that your acquaintance with political philosophy is extensive enough , you can try reading his The Machiavellian Enterprise , which is purposely too dense ; the point of that seems to be to see the complete Machiavellian critique of ancient thought and anticipation / critique of modern thought .
I . In this blog we work with a simplified account of the history of political thought .
It is purposely simplified so you can modify or reject it at your discretion later , if you wish .
Once there were the Ancients , Plato and Aristotle primarily .
They held that virtue and wisdom were important , and that the law of the city should perhaps promote the creation of virtuous men .
Then came Christianity , and it was not clear what was to happen to the city itself : is not the Law written into Creation itself , as well as revealed by God Himself ?
There was virtue , there was Law , but strangely absent was politics .
We move to 15th c. Italy .
Petty little rulers of various cities are pillaging , raping , murdering their own citizens , and their own citizens are standing idly , literally saying that God will punish eventually .
The Pope himself has worldly ambitions ; Pope Alexander has an illegitimate son , Cesare Borgia , whom he arms and allows to conquer otherwise peaceable areas .
The absence of politics is the absence of security ; if there is a natural law , it is completely overshadowed by the fact men are killing each other for the basest of reasons all the time .
What Machiavelli rejects are both classical and Christian notions of politics ; that part of the revolution in thought which becomes crucial to thinkers such as Shakespeare , Francis Bacon , Descartes , Milton , Hobbes , Locke , Spinoza can be seen easily if one is willing .
What is much harder to see is what Machiavelli stands for , in full .
II .
The critique of “ liberality ” in The Prince is a good place to see where Machiavelli breaks from classical and Christian thought “ in one stroke : ”
I say that it would be good to be held liberal ; nonetheless , liberality , when used so that you may be held liberal , hurts you .
For if it is used virtuously and as it should be used , it may not be recognized , and you will not escape the infamy of its contrary .
And so , if one wants to maintain a name for liberality among men , it is necessary not to leave our any kind of lavish display , so that a prince who has done this will always consume all his resources in such deeds .
In the end it will be necessary , if he wants to maintain a name for liberality , to burden the people extraordinarily , to be rigorous with taxes , and to do all those things that can be done to get money .
This will begin to make him hated by his subjects , and little esteemed by anyone as he becomes poor ; so having offended the many and rewarded the few with this liberality of his , he feels every least hardship and runs into risk at every slight danger .
When he recognizes this , and wants to draw back from it , he immediately incurs the infamy of meanness .
Thus , since a prince cannot , without damage to himself , use the virtue of liberality so that it is recognized , he should not , if he is prudent , care about a name for meanness .
For with time he will always be held more and more liberal when it is seen that with his parsimony his income is enough for him , that he can defend himself from whoever makes war on him , and that he can undertake campaigns without burdening the people .
( 62 - 63 , from XVI “ Of Liberality and Parsimony ” )
That this is a rejection of Christian thought is clear from the outset : to be liberal truly would mean to not let your left hand know what your right does .
The truly good must hide their goodness ; here , what is crucial is reputation alone .
But if that fails to convince , there ’s a whole argument showing that trying to do God ’s own bidding only helps a few and makes the many angry .
We are so used to the idea that the government which governs best governs least , i.e. the part of the second paragraph quoted above , that we do not realize how much of a secularization that is of the Law itself .
This is the beginning of the modern separation of Church and State , with the dark consequence that once the Church is separated , it may not exist again .
Part of what should bind us as Christians is the idea that the Word of God should apply to all of us , no ?
It is true that the City of God can only be known by God , but it also true that inasmuch as the Church is a community … well , you get the idea .
There is also a rejection of at least two of Aristotle ’s virtues in the Ethics , generosity ( private giving ) and magnificence ( public giving ) .
These issues get very thorny , but the rough idea is that the basis for another sort of equality is being set down .
If Aristotle is aiming for equality within a notion of politics where as many as possible can rule and be ruled in turn , we who are being trained as princes by Machiavelli are going to aim a bit lower .
Perhaps what unites us is n’t that we want others to rule well , but that we want to tear someone apart equally should he seem a bit too powerful at a given moment ( i.e. Hobbesian self - preservation in the state of nature ) .
III .
I speak of Machiavelli ’s notion that property is more important to many of us than our own families often , and it is probably best to quote that now :
The prince should nonetheless make himself feared in such a mode that if he does not acquire love , he escapes hatred , because being feared and not being hated can go together very well .
This he will always do if he abstains from the property of his citizens and his subjects , and from their women ; and if he also needs to proceed against someone ’s life , he must do it when there is suitable justification and manifest cause for it .
But above all , he must abstain from the property of others , because men forget the death of a father more quickly than the loss of a patrimony .
Furthermore , causes for taking away property are never lacking , and he who begins to live by rapine always finds cause to seize others ’ property ; and , on the contrary , causes for taking life are rarer and disappear more quickly .
( 67 , from XVII “ Of Cruelty and Mercy , and Whether It Is Better to Be Loved Than Feared , or the Contrary ” )
It ’s hard to get more blasphemous than this : in fact , I think it ’s impossible .
Notice how that in this passage which casually justifies the worst sort of nihilism – theft is more dangerous for a prince ’s behavior than murder , because he ’ll do the former more often – we find not only a tacit separation between executive and judicial ( the justification is separate from the action ) , but also the emphasis on the sanctity of private property which marks our current order , all bound up within an appeal to the self - interest of the prince .
Again , to be clear : Socrates a good portion of his time wondered aloud what virtue and justice were , and taught it within the limits of his power .
We are told to love justice and walk humbly with our God .
IV .
One more passage about what separation of powers / checks and balances may really be meant to resolve :
Among the well - ordered and governed kingdoms in our times is that of France ; and in it are infinite good institutions on which the liberty and security of the king depend .
The first of these is the parlement and its authority .
For the one who ordered that kingdom , knowing the ambition of the powerful and their insolence , and judging it necessary for them to have a bit in their mouths to correct them , and on the other side , knowing the hatred of the generality of people against the great , which is founded in its fear , and wanting to secure them , intended this not to be the particular concern of the king , so as to take from him the blame he would have from the great when he favored the great ; and so he constituted a third judge to be the one who would beat down the great and favor the lesser side without blame for the king .
This order could not be better , or more prudent , or a greater cause of the security of the king and the kingdom .
From this one can infer another notable thing : that princes should have anything blameable administered by others , favors by themselves .
Again I conclude that a prince should esteem the great , but not make himself hated by the people .
( 74 - 75 , from XIX , “ Of Avoiding Contempt and Hatred ” )
I have purposely chosen to end with an ambiguous passage .
This is obviously not separation of powers as we know it in the American system .
Rather , it ’s an accounting of considerations for an end , and you can pick the end : how secure do you want the king to be ?
Here , the key is that the “ kingdom ” is secure ; this may be an end Machiavelli wants us to consider , given that we were told earlier certain parts of France ( read : the few ) would gladly invite foreign powers in if it served their purpose .
I think for now , I ’ll just say this : between a nation torn by ambition ( few ) and fear ( many ) , the executive – upon which protection from invasion depends – is actually a pretty delicate institution .
His ability to secure loyalty is the cornerstone upon which everything depends ; perhaps we should rethink the vast amount of Bush - bashing still going on and the Obama - bashing getting much nastier in some circles , luxuries , you will note , that the military – for reasons that again trace deeply to Machiavellian thought – does not partake in .
The “ one ” is tied to the “ many , ” always , and that will set up my future posts ; a lot of being able to read The Prince depends on seeing the One in the text who does rule the Many .
I ’m not quite sure when the next post will be , or how many of these considerations I ’ve put forth I will have to take back .
Machiavelli was a devoted reader of Xenophon , but my work is on Xenophon ’s Socrates , and I avoid a good chunk of the Xenophon Machiavelli talks about .
I ’m not even sure that would help me get through The Prince , in any case ; this is my umpeenth time through the book and it finds newer and newer ways of going over my head each time .
If some of you start writing in the comments that you ’re reading The Prince , I ’ll probably postpone publishing the next post a bit longer .

Even if he is proven to be the aspiring terrorist the government asserts , how and why he became one may not be understood for months , if ever .

A tour of where Mr. Zazi worked and lived , in New York and in Colorado , and interviews with investigators , the Zazi family and friends , provides something of a fuller picture , one filled with the routines of life in Queens but also flecked with hints of his emerging anger , contradictions and puzzles .
Mr. Zazi is both an Afghan immigrant steeped in the traditions of Islam and a kid from the streets of Queens , where his family moved in the early 1990s .
As a teenager , he often carried two things , his basketball and his prayer mat , his friends say .
He grew a dark , wiry beard and began wearing tunics several years ago , just as he was applying for his first of two Macy ’s credit cards .
He was a janitor and a worshiper at a mosque that split several years ago over the question of its members ’ loyalty to the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks .
He was a devoted fan of gadgets who married , by arrangement , his 19 - year - old cousin , who lives with their two children in Pakistan .
Last summer , the authorities say , he shopped in Denver for hair supplies to build bombs with .
If he did so , he was also engaged in something much more mundane : credit counseling to survive a bankruptcy he had declared in New York .
It is impossible at this moment to know what it all adds up to .
But the details that are being learned create the sense of a far more complicated man than the coffee cart vendor many people saw .
Certainly the government ’s charges have painted the outlines of a man Mr. Zazi ’s family is having a very difficult time reconciling with the Najib they knew .
Nigel Lythgoe just phoned us and said the FOX Standards and Practices Department says -- of the photo of the " So You Think You Can Dance " contestant --
" It is a crease in the young lady 's panties . "
We 've looked ... carefully ... and we do n't see any panties .
But we 're not infallible .
We 're not going to unblur the photo , so if you really want to judge for yourself go to our friends at Dlisted.com .
And then come back and vote .

Radioactive cobalt cleared from Lebanese lab .
Recovering ' lost ' radioactive sources can reduce the risk that they will fall into terrorists ' hands .

The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) has repatriated dozens of Russian - made , highly radioactive sources that had been languishing unused in a Lebanese research institute for more than a decade .
The effort forms part of a wider IAEA initiative to secure radioactive materials used in scientific research , medicine and industry , which could potentially be used by terrorists to make a so - called ' dirty bomb ' .
IAEA officials identified possible security issues with the radioactive material at an unspecified agricultural institute in Lebanon in 2006 .
They were concerned to find that a cobalt - 60 irradiator , originally used for a biological pest control project , had been lying dormant since 1996 .
The sealed unit still contained 36 individual sources with a combined activity of 3,500 Curies , making it the most powerful source of radioactivity in Lebanon .
The irradiator had previously been used to sterilize male Mediterranean fruit flies or medfly ( Ceratitis capitata ) , with a view to controlling the medfly population and preventing crop damage by egg - laying females .
But after the project ended , all the staff members who knew how to look after the radioactive equipment subsequently left the institute , leaving the cobalt - 60 sources potentially insecure .
“ It 's a thousand - piece jigsaw puzzle and this is at best one piece . ” Matthew Bunn
Harvard University
The sources were fully shielded , so there was no risk to research staff entering the room where the irradiator was stored .
" We were worried about the risk of theft , either for the value of the irradiator or particularly for malicious purposes , " said Robin Heard , an IAEA radioactive source specialist who oversaw the mission .
If the sources had been removed from the container , direct exposure to the radioactive material could have killed someone within minutes .
Source of worry
Plans to repatriate the radioactive material were initially delayed , owing to general political instability in the region , and in particular Israel 's bombing of Lebanon 's airport , which prevented outgoing flights .
The sources were finally moved to a secure storage facility in Russia on 30 August .
" This is a big enough set of sources to be worrisome were it to fall into terrorists ' hands , " says Matthew Bunn , a non-proliferation expert at Harvard University .
" Lebanon is certainly a country with some fairly substantial terrorist activity . "
The IAEA 's repatriation mission in Lebanon was a piece of " good international housekeeping " , adds John Simpson , an expert on nuclear non-proliferation at the University of Southampton 's Mountbatten Centre for International Studies , the United Kingdom .
" It is clearly extremely sensible that the IAEA should try to get all states to account for all radioactive sources that are within their territories . "
While this operation was a success , it merely scratches the surface of a global problem , says Bunn : " It 's a thousand - piece jigsaw puzzle and this is at best one piece . "

The IAEA has identified more radioactive material that it would like to remove from Lebanon , although the location and activities of these sources is not being made public .
The cost of the removal programme has been met by the European Union .
IAEA officials are also working in Africa and former Soviet Union satellite states to improve the security of radioactive materials .
In the Ukraine , for example , a centralized storage facility is planned to house used radioactive sources from across the country .
Construction of the facility within the Chernobyl exclusion zone is expected to begin later this year .
The UK government has pledged £ 2.1 million from its Global Threat Reduction Programme towards the scheme .
The concept of monotheism has always bothered me .
How can someone believe in only one God ?
Even if they are deluded to the point that they believe they can communicate with a higher being , how do they know it ’s the same being every time .
Surely any being that was capable of such communication , or a being approaching omnipotence , would be aware of any prior communications , and as such would be able to appear as the same being .
So believing in a single God is possibly more illogical than believing in multiple Gods .
Now , we know that logic is n’t a strong point of those who follow religion , but surely there must be some reason why people choose to believe that there is only one God , and it happens to be the one they worship .
The obvious answer is that the Holy Books say that the God of that particular book is the only God .
Take the Bible for example , specificly Isaiah 44:6 in which the Judeo - Christian God ( Yahweh ) states :
“ There is no God Beside Me ”
As a reader of this blog you ’ll know that religions have a vested interest in making you believe that their God is the only God , so should n’t be trusted .
But even if you did take the Bible as “ gospel ” , it ’s not as clear cut as one might think .
Looking at the 10 commandments , the foundations of Christian Morality ( and self - preservation ) , we see that Yahweh acknowledges that there are other Gods out there .
Specifically :
“ You shall have no other gods before me ”
Like most of the Bible , this can be interpreted in a number of ways .
Upon first reading the natural response is to take this as Yahweh accepting there are other Gods and trying to assert his superiority over them .
There is a subtle but important difference between “ do n’t believe in any other Gods ” and “ do n’t worship any other Gods over me ” .
Any logical person would surely see this as a confession that other Gods exist .
But as I mentioned earlier , logic is not the religious person ’s strong point , and as such they have attempted to explain away this little problem .
The most popular “ explanation ” is that the commandment is referring to temptations , worldly goods etc. , rather than actual Gods .
This , of course , is patently ridiculous .
To interpret the word “ God ” here as meaning something other than a supreme deity opens the possibility of interpreting it elsewhere in the Bible in the same way .
Unless , of course , you choose to selectively apply this interpretation in the same way many Christians selectively believe only parts of the Bible .
This undermines the entire concept of Yahweh as a deity as proposed by the Bible .
The commandment is not the only hint that the writers of the Bible ( bearing in mind it ’s inspired by God ) thought there was more than one God .
The observant amongst you might have noticed that part way through Genesis the way God is referred to changes .
Initially the word “ Elohim ” is used .
Elohim is generally used as a plural , referring to Gods of polytheism .
Much like the attempts to dismiss the use of the word “ God ” in certain circumstances , many have tried to claim that in some circumstances it refers to multiple Gods , whilst in others it refers to a single deity .
Their deity , of course .
Part way through Genesis , the word Elohim is replaced by Yahweh .
This is a complicated subject , and remains a point of debate .
Yahweh and Elohim are Hebrew words that have been translated into English .
The commandment example used in the beginning of this post actually uses the word “ Elohim ” ( translated to “ Gods ” ) , which only serves to underline and reenforce the points I made .
I ’m interested in your opinions on this .
I find the explanations provided by theists hard to swallow .
There ’s an inherent lack of logic underlying the counter points that just does n’t sit right .
Admittedly much of this is word play , but when religion is primarily based on a book , wordplay , and the interpretation of the language used , becomes a point of upmost importance .
Health Care
Democrats Signal Embrace of Co-op Plans
By John Amick
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius signaled on Sunday a willingness from the White House to embrace insurance cooperatives as the main plank of health - care reform rather than pushing for a public option in the final version of legislation being debated in Washington and throughout town halls across America .
" I think the president is just continuing to say , let 's not have this be the only focus of the conversation , " Sebelius , on CNN 's " State of the Union , " said about the focus of a public - option inclusion .
" Coverage for all Americans , lowering the crushing cost for everyone , making sure that we have new rules for insurance companies , that they can't dump people out of the marketplace if you get sick , that they can't drop your coverage based on a pre-existing condition , that you can't be priced out because you 're a woman instead of a man , and gender discrimination wo n't be allowed to continue anymore .
Those are really essential parts of the program , along with choice and competition , which I think we 'll have at the end of the day . "
Further placing a public option in jeopardy , Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) , a major player in the Senate Finance Committee 's negotiations on reform -- considered to be the prime vehicle for health - care reform legislation in the Senate -- said on Sunday that hope for a government - run public option to be included in a final reform bill is all but dead .
" The fact of the matter is there are not the votes in the United States Senate for the public option , " Conrad said on " Fox News Sunday . "
" There never have been .
So to continue to chase that rabbit , I think , is just a wasted effort . "
Proponents who have voiced support for a public option to " keep the insurance companies honest , " should temper their ambitions for its inclusion in final legislation , Conrad said .
Such statements come a day after President Obama himself suggested that supporters of reform should be realistic about what will eventually come out of Congress .
" The truth is -- I want to be completely honest here -- there is no perfect , painless silver bullet out there that solves every problem , gives everyone perfect health care , for free , " Obama said in front of a town hall in Colorado .
" There is n't .
I wish there was . "
Despite saying Obama 's faith in a government option was strong , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs also would not commit to any insistence of a public option from the White House .
" What I am saying is the bottom line for this for the president is , what we have to have is choice and competition in the insurance market , " Gibbs said on CBS 's " Face the Nation . "
" Again , if you are in a place in this country where you only get one choice , how in the world are you going to be able to convince anybody that you are driving down costs when you do n't have to compete against anything ? "
Town hall debates have driven much of the national narrative on health care in recent weeks .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Pa. ) , one member of Congress that took a lot of heat last week at town halls from opponents of health - care reform , said the sometimes fiery community meetings should not control the discourse on the national health - care debate .
" I think people are very nervous because so many have lost their jobs , " Specter said on ABC's " This Week . "
" Remember , we do n't have [ a health - care bill ] in the Senate yet , and none has come to the House floor , but I think we have to bear in mind that , although those people need to be heard and have a right to be heard , that they 're not really representative of America , in -- in my opinion . "
Also on " This Week , " Sen . Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) refused to give an opinion on a major topic of misinformation in the reform discussion , the widespread rumor of end - of - life care - rationing in potential health - care legislation .
Speculation that provisions for seniors to consult with a doctor before deteriorating health conditions obstruct sound end - of - life decisions will result in a kind of involuntary euthanasia has been repudiated by other Republicans , including Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska .
" I do n't think I 'm going to make that decision , " Hatch said when asked if he would defend or reject the rhetoric .
" You know , there are many different people who have many different opinions on what is meant by these programs . "
When pressed by ABC's Jake Tapper to explain this silence compared to his vote for Medicare reform legislation in 2003 , during a time of a strong Republican majority , that included end - of - life consultations , Hatch responded by suggesting any kind of government option would certainly result in rationing of care to senior citizens .
Hatch also defended his crafting of federal government - sponsored SCHIP legislation , the State Children 's Health Insurance Program , to ensure health insurance to children in low - income families across America , which is in direct contrast to his opposition of any hint of a public option in today 's reform effort .
He blamed liberals for perverting the bipartisan legislation he crafted with Sen .
Ted Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) .
" It worked amazingly well until the liberals started to push more and more Medicaid -- more and more Medicaid people into the CHIP program and started to expand the CHIP program in ways that were never contemplated , " Hatch said .
" Everything the Democrats are doing is pushing towards what 's called a single - payer system , where the government basically controls everything .
And this public plan , this public government plan , do n't think for a minute that that will not destroy the current insurance system . "
Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter , who joined President Obama at the town hall Saturday in Grand Junction , Colo. , lamented the lack of sound information due to opposing forces and the fact that no solid legislation is ready to receive a full inspection , making the current back - and - forth much less constructive than Democrats planned .
Ritter , on NBC's " Meet the Press , " also said he did n't think it was fair to blame Obama for the uneven debate .
" I do n't know that you can blame the president for this .
I think a good part of this has to do [ with ] how you opened the show ... it 's the sort of partisan wrangling , " Ritter said .
" And maybe that 's even too nice of a word for what 's been happening with these town hall meetings .
They 're capturing the attention .
Americans listen to where the conflict is , where the swords are crossed .
But they 're not , I think , getting all of the information about this . "
A recent Gallup poll finds 49 percent of respondents disappointed in the way Obama has handled health - care policy .
The poll shows 43 percent approve of his job on the issue .
When asked if Obama can uphold his campaign pledge to not tax anyone making under $ 250,000 in personal income when paying for reform , Rep. Charles Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) , head of the House Ways and Means Committee , said he 's confident a proposed surtax on the wealthiest Americans will not dip into the middle class .
" Yes , he can and he will " uphold the promise , Rangel said on " Meet the Press . "
" The problem that we have is , is what do you score , what does the Congressional Budget Office count as being a savings ?
Is it people -- what happened to the last few years of someone 's life ?
Is it the overcharging that the pharmaceuticals and doctors have ?
Is it the number of people that go in and out of hospitals and we do n't reward those who do the right thing ?
These are questions we should be talking about . "

December 2005 Edition Supplement ( Re : FY2005 Treasury GAAP Accounting )
JOHN WILLIAMS ' SHADOW GOVERNMENT STATISTICS
Issue Number 14B
( Supplement to Regular December Edition )
December 19 , 2005
_____
U.S. Treasury Shows $ 3.5 Trillion 2005 GAAP - Based Federal Deficit
Net of Social Security / Medicare , GAAP - Based Deficit
Widened to $ 760 Billion from $ 616 Billion
Federal Government Liabilities Top $ 50 Trillion
Administration Moves to Obfuscate the Big Picture After
Two Years of Reasonably Forthright Reporting
Net of all accounting gimmicks , the actual federal budget deficit is running at an unsustainable , system - dooming pace of $ 3.5 trillion per year , roughly 11 times the size of the $ 318.5 billion accounting - gimmicked official deficit for 2005 .
The U.S. Government 's negative net worth widened to $ 49.4 trillion in 2005 , with total government liabilities topping $ 50 trillion for the first time .
The
Including Social Security , Medicare and similar liabilities , the total GAAP - based 2005 deficit was $ 3.5 trillion , down from 2004 's $ 11.1 trillion , which was spiked by a one - time setup charge for recent Medicare enhancements .
Net of the one - time charge , which we have re-estimated based on the 2005 data ( the government has not published an estimate ) , the GAAP - based deficit in 2004 was about $ 3.4 trillion .

-----------------------------------------------------------------
As shown in the accompanying table , a debilitating pattern has started to surface in U.S. government operations , with annual GAAP - based deficits , net of gimmicked accounting and one - time charges , running at $ 3.7 trillion in 2003 , $ 3.4 trillion in 2004 and $ 3.5 trillion in 2005 .
From Clarity to Obfuscation in One Year
Administration comments in last year 's financial statements were refreshingly honest about the severity of the United States ' fiscal travails .
Such was not the case in the more heavily politicized 2005 statements .
From the second page of " Management 's Discussion and Analysis " ( page 4 ) of the 2004 statements [ 2 ] :
" In a table on page 11 of this section , the net present value for all of the responsibilities ( for [ Social Security / Medicare ] current participants over a 75 - year period ) is $ 45,892 billion , including Medicare and Social Security payments , pensions and benefits for Federal employees and veterans , and other financial responsibilities .
The reader needs to understand these responsibilities to get a more complete understanding of the government 's finances [ our emphasis ] . "
The referenced table showed a net annual deterioration in the government 's 2004 financial position of $ 11.1 trillion , consistent with the data shown above .
The 2005 statements , however , contained no such advice to the reader nor a table .
The emphasis of 2005 Management 's Discussion and Analysis was an analysis as to why the GAAP deficit really shrank instead of widened .
Accounting double - talk was used citing an actuarial assumption change that increased the Department of Veterans Affairs liabilities , while all other considerations ranging from Katrina to the War on Terror were lumped into a negligible " net " other cost increases category that combined largely offsetting accruals .
With no text or table showing the big picture , as there had been in 2004 , the only indication as to what the numbers were that reflected consistent levels and changes in the net present value of Social Security , Medicare , etc. was the following comment under Other Responsibilities , page 12 of the 2005 statements :
" The 2005 balance sheet shows liabilities of $ 9,915 billion .
In addition , the government 's responsibilities to make future payments for social insurance and certain other programs are not shown as liabilities according to Federal accounting standards ; however , they are measured in other contexts .
These programmatic commitments remain Federal responsibilities and as currently structured will have a significant claim on budgetary resources in the future .
" The net present value for all of the responsibilities ( for current participants over a 75 - year period ) is $ 49,403 billion , including Medicare and Social Security payments , pensions and benefits for Federal employees and veterans , and other financial responsibilities . "
After reworking the underlying data [ 3 ] , the $ 49,403 billion is the GAAP - basis net worth of the U.S. government , which translates into $ 50.9 trillion in liabilities , versus $ 1.6 trillion in assets , and a net annual loss in 2005 of $ 3.5 trillion from the government 's operations .
The GAO Speaks Out
The recently renamed Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) has the job of certifying the government 's GAAP - based statements , but it has refused to do so , given material reporting deficiencies .
With the Treasury touting a reduced 2005 budget deficit and unwilling to repeat 2004's big picture cautions in this year 's " Management 's Discussion and Analysis , " the GAO offered ( page 137 ) :
" While we are unable to express an opinion on the U.S. government 's consolidated financial statements , several key items deserve emphasis in order to put the information contained in the financial statements and the " Management 's Discussion and Analysis " section of the Financial Report of the United States Government into context .
" First , while the reported $ 319 billion fiscal year 2005 unified budget deficit was significantly lower than the $ 412 billion unified budget deficit in fiscal year 2004 , it was still very high given current economic growth rates and the overall composition of federal spending .
Furthermore , the federal government 's reported net operating cost , which included expenses incurred during the year , increased to $ 760 billion in fiscal year 2005 from $ 616 billion in fiscal 2004 .
" Second , the U.S. government 's total reported liabilities total more than $ 46 trillion , representing close to four times current GDP and up from about $ 20 trillion or two times GDP in 2000 .
" Finally , while the nation 's long - term fiscal imbalance continues to grow , the retirement of the " baby boom " generation is closer to becoming a reality with the first wave of boomers eligible for early retirement under Social Security in 2008 .
Given these and other factors , it seems clear that the nation 's current fiscal path is unsustainable and tough choices by the President and the Congress are necessary in order to address the nation 's large and growing - long - term fiscal imbalance . "
For anyone interested in the GAO 's thoughts on the material deficiencies in the financial reporting of the Departments of Defense , Homeland Security and Energy , the full text can be downloaded from the earlier noted website .
No Way Out -- System Doomed to Hyperinflation
The regular , annual $ 3.5 trillion shortfall in government operations cannot be covered by Uncle Sam ; the situation has deteriorated beyond any hope of a solution within the existing system .
Raise taxes ?
Even a 100 % personal income tax would leave a deficit .
Cut spending ?
Spending cuts that would bring government fiscal conditions into some semblance of order would be so draconian as to be beyond any political possibility in today 's environment .
What remains inevitable -- only a matter of time -- is a national bankruptcy .
Such circumstances in the past -- though no nation on earth has ever come close to experiencing the level of fiscal and financial fraud now being perpetrated on the American people -- typically have been " cured " by revving up the printing presses and creating excessive quantities of money .
The end result is a monetary collapse in a hyperinflation , with the currency becoming worthless .

The $ 760.0 billion was up 23.2 % from 2004 's $ 615.6 billion GAAP - based deficit , while the official , accounting - gimmicked 2005 deficit of $ 318.5 declined by 22.8 % from $ 412.3 billion in 2004 .
