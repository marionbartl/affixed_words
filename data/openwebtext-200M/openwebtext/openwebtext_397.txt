WASHINGTON ( AP ) – President Bush ’s former chief political adviser denied meddling in the Justice Department ’s prosecution of Alabama ’s ex-governor and said Sunday the courts will have to resolve a congressional subpoena for his testimony .
” Congress , the House Judiciary Committee , wants to be able to call presidential aides on its whim up to testify , ” Karl Rove said .
“ It ’s going to be tied up in court and settled in court . ”
Last week , the committee ordered Rove to appear July 10 .
Lawmakers want to ask him about the White House ’s role in firing nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 and the prosecution of former Gov. Don Siegelman , D - Ala .
Also under congressional subpoena are Bush ’s chief of staff , Joshua Bolten , and his former counsel , Harriet Miers .
The White House is citing executive privilege , the doctrine intended to protect the confidentiality of presidential communications , in refusing to let them testify .
The fight over testimony for Bolten and Miers is in federal court and may not be settled until after Bush ’s term ends in January .
Siegelman was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for a 2006 bribery conviction .
He was released in March when a federal appeals court ruled he raised “ substantial questions of fact and law ” in his appeal .
Siegelman has accused GOP operatives of pushing prosecution .
His claims were bolstered last year by Republican campaign volunteer Jill Simpson , who issued a sworn statement that she overheard conversations suggesting that Rove was involved in his case .
On Sunday , Rove brushed off suggestions that he meddled in Siegelman ’s case .
“ I found out about Don Siegelman ’s investigation and indictment by reading about it in the newspaper , ” Rove said .
“ I heard about it , read about it , learned about it for the first time by reading about it in the newspaper . ”
Rove also said his lawyers had offered alternative ways to provide the House committee information short of sworn testimony , but that lawmakers had refused .
For example , Rove ’s lawyer , Robert Luskin , has said Rove could discuss the case on the condition that his comments not be under oath and not be transcribed .
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , Rep. John Conyers , D - Mich . , and several other lawmakers , however , have said such an interview “ will not permit us to obtain a straightforward and clear record . ”
Rove spoke on “ This Week ” on ABC .
David Pollak announced the 0.6 release of lift yesterday :
lift is an expressive and elegant framework for writing web applications .
lift stresses the importance of security , maintainability , scalability and performance , while allowing for high levels of developer productivity .
lift 0.6 brings the following exciting new and enhanced features : - Scala 2.7.0 support ( which means that you can once again use Eclipse to develop lift apps )
- Localization of core lift classes ( Thanks Marius )
- Enhancements to Redirect support
- Cookie support ( rather than using underlying Servlet cookie support )
- Enhancements to Prepared Statements
- Significant enhancements to JSON support and client - side HTML generation
- Improved tests and documentation ( thanks Eric )
InfoQ took the opportunity to ask David about some of the motivations that lead him to develop lift , as well as his experiences with Scala to date .
Can you give us some background on your experiences that led to developing lift ?
I had done 18 months of Rails and 10 years of Java development .
Rails was a fresh perspective on web development ... common tasks were the " short path " items .
It was great .
However , I found that Ruby 's dynamic typing led to a lot of errors and the requirement for 95 % test coverage in order to have reasonable deployments .
Unfortunately , to get 95 % test coverage , my code size ( including tests ) ballooned to near Java sizes .
Additionally , because Rails " changes things " ( it has different methods that it dynamically changes ) between development , test , and deployment , even with excellent test coverage , there were frequent deployment mishaps .
The above problems intersected with the MRI Ruby implementation being slow and unstable and a development community that did n't care , I decided to " look elsewhere . "
I stumbled across Scala and instantly realized it was what I was looking for .
Scala has all the language features that I like in Ruby and all the language features I like in Java .
It was a " you 've got your peanut butter in my chocolate " moment for me .
What makes Scala a great environment to build a web framework in ?
Syntax .
Performance .
Stability .
An excellent type system that 's only there when you need it .
Closures .
Pattern Matching .
Built in XML literals .
Actors .
It 's hard to decide .
What would you say differentiates lift from Rails , Seaside or Java frameworks such as Struts or Spring MVC ?
As easy and concise as Rails .
As secure and stateful as Seaside and Wicket .
Type - safe yet not hyper - verbose unlike Struts .
Better Comet support than any other web framework .
Support for " real time " application that allow many people to collaborate .
So , you can build wicked powerful apps wicked fast ( just like Rails . )
But you do n't have the issue of shovelling all your state into a relational database .
The state is " live " not freeze - dried and that makes a huge difference for writing apps that go beyond front ends to database tables .
Can you describe your experiences deploying lift in a production environment ?
What sort of performance are you seeing ?
I 've done a fair amount of benchmarking lift applications .
The lift render pipeline is short and sweet and lift runs on standard web containers .
This means that you get similar performance to well written J2EE apps .
For non-database pages , lift typically has sub 1 ms render time .
For pages that require hitting the database , page render times are related to db access .
On an Amazon EC2 instance ( 1.7 Ghz Intel processor with 2 GB of RAM ) , I was able to sustain 500 + pages per second and 50 % of those pages had DB access and the MySQL instance was running on the same box .
How do you see lift working with existing Java applications , or in mixed language environments ( e.g. JRuby ) ?
Blaming environmentalists for high energy prices , never mind the evidence , has been a hallmark of the Bush administration .
Thus , in 2001 Dick Cheney attributed the California electricity crisis to environmental regulations that , he claimed , were blocking power - plant construction .
He completely missed the real story , which was that energy companies  probably some of the same companies that participated in his secret task force , which was supposed to be drawing up a national energy strategy  were driving up prices by deliberately withholding electricity from the market .
And the administration has spent the last eight years trying to convince Congress that the key to America ’s energy security is opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling  even though estimates from the Energy Information Administration suggest that drilling in the refuge would make very little difference to the energy outlook , and the oil companies themselves are n’t especially interested in punching holes in the tundra .
But it still comes as a surprise and a disappointment to see John McCain joining that unfortunate tradition .
Each day , we are bombarded with options -- at the local coffee shop , at work , in stores or on the TV at home .
Do you want a double - shot soy latte , a caramel macchiato or simply a tall house coffee for your morning pick - me - up " Having choices is typically thought of as a good thing .
Maybe not , say researchers who found we are more fatigued and less productive when faced with a plethora of choices .
Researchers from several universities have determined that even though humans ’ ability to weigh choices is remarkably advantageous , it can also come with some serious liabilities .
People faced with numerous choices , whether good or bad , find it difficult to stay focused enough to complete projects , handle daily tasks or even take their medicine .
These findings appear in the April issue of Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , which is published by the American Psychological Association .
Researchers conducted seven experiments involving 328 participants and 58 consumers at a shopping mall .
In the laboratory experiments , some participants were asked to make choices about consumer products , college courses or class materials .
Other participants did not have to make decisions but simply had to consider the options in front of them .
The scientists then asked each group to participate in one of two unpleasant tasks .
Some were told to finish a healthy but ill - tasting drink ( akin to taking ones medicine ) .
Other participants were told to put their hands in ice water .
The tasks were designed to test how the previous act of choosing , or not choosing , affected peoples ’ ability to stay on task and maintain behaviors aimed at reaching a goal .
Researchers found that the participants who earlier had made choices had more trouble staying focused and finishing the disagreeable but goal - focused tasks compared to the participants who initially did not have to make choices .
In other experiments , participants were given math problems to practice for an upcoming test .
The participants who had to make important choices involving coursework spent less time solving the math problems and more time engaging in other distractions such as playing video games or reading magazines , compared to participants who were not asked to make choices prior to that point .
The participants who made choices also got more math problems wrong than participants not faced with decisions .
To further buttress their laboratory findings , the researchers conducted a field test at a shopping mall .
The shoppers reported how much decision - making they had done while shopping that day and then were asked to solve simple arithmetic problems .
The researchers found that the more choices the shoppers had made earlier in the day , the worse they performed on the math problems .
The authors note they controlled for how long the participants had been shopping , and for several demographic categories such as age , race , ethnicity and gender .
Kathleen D. Vohs , PhD , the study ’s lead author and a member of the University of Minnesota ’s marketing department , concluded that making choices apparently depletes a precious resource within the human mind .
“ Maintaining one ’s focus while trying to solve problems or completing an unpleasant task was much harder for those who had made choices compared to those who had not , ” says Vohs .
“ This pattern was found in the laboratory , classroom and shopping mall .
Having to make the choice was the key .
It did not matter if the researchers told them to make choices , or if it was a spontaneously made choice , or if making the choice had consequences or not . ”
But what about making fun choices "
How does that affect our mental acuity "
In their last experiment , researchers determined that making a few enjoyable decisions , such as spending four minutes selecting items for a gift registry , was shown to be less mentally draining than when participants spent 12 minutes doing the same task .
In other words , even if people are having fun making decisions , their cognitive functions are still being depleted with every choice they make .
Vohs says these experiments provide evidence that making choices , as opposed to just thinking about options , is what is especially taxing .
“ There is a significant shift in the mental programming that is made at the time of choosing , whether the person acts on it at that time or sometime in the future .
Therefore , simply the act of choosing can cause mental fatigue , ” says Vohs .
“ Making choices can be difficult and taxing , and there is a personal price to choosing . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Most of the 17 Democratic senators who are uncommitted superdelegates will endorse Sen.
Barack Obama for president this week , sources told CNN Monday .
Sen .
Barack Obama is expected to pick up superdelegate endorsements after Tuesday 's contests , sources say .
The lawmakers will wait until after the South Dakota and Montana primaries Tuesday before announcing their support for Obama , two sources familiar with discussions between Obama supporters and these senators told CNN's Gloria Borger .
Obama supporters have been " pressing " for these superdelegates to endorse early this week , but according to one source , " the senators do n't want to pound Hillary Clinton , and there is a sense she should be given a grace period . "
A series of meetings on the topic have been facilitated at different times by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin , former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and Iowa Sen . Tom Harkin .
Durbin and Daschle are Obama supporters , while Harkin is uncommitted .
Obama is now 46 delegates short of the 2,118 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination , while Clinton needs 202 .
There are 31 pledged delegates up for grabs in the Tuesday contests , and 202 superdelegates have yet to commit to either candidate .
Watch how the race could end »
Obama has the support of 331 superdelegates to Clinton 's 292 .
Superdelegates are party elected officials and activists who are free to vote for either candidate .

Following Sunday 's Puerto Rico primary , Obama picked up two more superdelegate nods , and Clinton received one .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi will remain uncommitted until Clinton officially drops out of the race , sources told CNN's Candy Crowley , but that is n't stopping the two party heavyweights from using their clout to bring the primary battle to a hasty end .
Pelosi told the San Francisco Chronicle last week that she is prepared to intervene if the presidential race does not resolve itself by the end of June .
" I will step in , " Pelosi told the paper in an interview .
" Because we cannot take this fight to the convention .
...
It must be over before then . "
A senior Democratic aide in Congress also told CNN on Friday that Pelosi is already calling uncommitted superdelegates and pressuring them to back either Obama or Clinton by the end of this week .
Pelosi is collaborating with Reid on the effort .
In an interview with a San Francisco radio station last week , Reid said he spoke to Pelosi and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean .
" We all are going to urge our folks next week to make a decision very quickly , " Reid said .
Throughout the process , Dean has been pressing for superdelegates to make up their minds after this week 's contests .
Facing an insurmountable lead among pledged delegates , Clinton is now counting on the remaining superdelegates to push her over the finish line , a proposition her campaign admits is a tall order .
" Is the road steeper than it was several weeks ago ? , " Clinton adviser Harold Ickes remarked on CNN's " Late Edition " on Sunday .
" The answer is yes . "
Still , Clinton told reporters after her primary win in Puerto Rico on Sunday that given her support among key demographics in swing states , she has proved she will be a stronger nominee than Obama against John McCain .
" I think it 's only now that we 're finishing these contests that people are going to actually reflect , " Clinton said on her campaign plane Sunday , referring to the uncommitted superdelegates .
" Who 's our stronger candidate ?
And I believe I am , and I 'm going to make that case , and at some point it will either be accepted or it wo n't be , but I feel strongly about making it . "
Clinton argued that even superdelegates who have committed to Obama are free to " change their minds " -- a suggestion the Obama campaign declined to comment on .
Despite the odds against her , Clinton continues to pick up support even as Obama grows his lead among superdelegates .
All About U.S. Presidential Election • Democratic Party
Behind all the words , the turning over of facts , the analysis , the frantic speculation ( did the wife know ? ) and the tormented search for meanings ( how could this happen ? ) , lies a central image : a woman and her three children buried alive , toothless , hunchbacked , pale - skinned , talking in their own mumbling language , just beneath the surface of everyday life for 24 years .
It is like a Grimm fairytale , like an instant , terrifying myth of monsters and their captives and an image of what humanity is capable of .
At the same time it is a tender , damaged little family clinging together , watching TV and drawing pictures of the sun they had never seen in their plumbed and well - lit dungeon in small - town Austria .
The case of Josef Fritzl is beyond the wilder shores of our comprehension and yet it fits with an unsettling neatness to a whole set of domestic stereotypes .
It reads both like a work of pornography that brings together every imaginable act of cruelty and degradation , and also like a grotesque cartoon strip of everyday life .
So Fritzl is an electrical engineer with well - polished shoes and a sense of punctiliousness and respectability , who apparently was a ' despot ' in his upstairs home , the patriarch with a tyrannical sense of the roles of men and women .
Like many men , he had the equivalent of a garden shed where he could retreat and practise his hobby - except in his case the hobby was rape , was imprisonment , was fathering seven children by his daughter , was throwing the child who died into the incinerator like a piece of garbage , was turning his own children into the subjects of some ghastly experiment , was becoming the concentration camp guard of his self - built basement world .
And though his crime was perverse , it was also bizarrely bureaucratic .
He applied for , and received , a grant for his underground prison ; the building was well planned and expertly carried out ; the fridge was stocked with food .
Indeed , he is apparently aggrieved that people might think his prisoners could have died when he was on one of his extended sex tourism holidays , insisting that he had always planned ahead .
The human mind has an extraordinary ability to defend itself against itself and protect itself from self - knowledge and guilt .
Like the camp guards who could go home at night to listen to Mozart , cry at poetry and play with their children , it is perfectly possible that Fritzl feels quite self - justified .
But it 's a concentration camp in suburbia , where epic horror meets familiarity .
Many women have no idea what their husbands get up to in their garden sheds or down in the cellar with their tools or their developing fluids .
Indeed , many marriages are based on respecting the privacy of the spouse and allowing them their own space .
Do n't ask , do n't nag , it 's his thing .
Fritzl insisted on being undisturbed and apparently his wife obeyed him .
The question being asked all round the world is , how could she not have known ?
But this is the same question asked about wives who do n't have any suspicions about their husband 's infidelities and about Sonia Sutcliffe of her murderous husband , or Primrose Shipman of hers .
They do n't know because it 's hidden , and they do n't know because they do n't want to know , and they do n't know because they have pushed the knowledge deep inside , and their world is arranged around that denial .
Then there 's the stereotype of the father - daughter relationship .
Fritzl gives new meaning to the term ' control freak ' .
Elisabeth was only 11 when he started to abuse her , but it was n't until she was 18 and an adult that he put her in the literal prison , where he treated her both like his sex - slave and his alternative wife and mother to his second family .
He has apparently said that he locked her up because he was worried that she would take drugs and go to the bad : in this crazed version , he becomes the stern but protective father , saving his wayward child from the dangers of life beyond the family .
It 's a monstrous mirror image of another famous Austrian father , Captain von Trapp , with his seven children and his whistle to keep them in order .
And , for many , Fritzl is like a nightmare symbol of Austria itself , a country that has pushed its Nazi past underground and represented itself as a victim rather than a perpetrator .
The fairytale horror is overlaid with provincial order and dull domestic cliché .
Home is an ugly grey house with lodgers and an obedient wife ; the dungeon guarded by a monster was built on grant money and had running water , tiles and sofas ; the pervert maintained his air of respectability throughout and has shown a self - righteous indignation at some of the allegations .
Oscar Wilde 's Dorian Gray put the portrait of his moral disintegration into an attic .
Perhaps Fritzl 's fearsomely efficient compartmentalisation of his life ( upstairs and downstairs , open and hidden , propriety and unimaginable depravity ) allowed him to avoid looking at the self he has become , a man who will haunt his country for decades .
The question of whether Fritzl 's wife knew dwindles next to the question of whether Fritzl himself knew what type of loathsome thing he had become .

The World from Berlin ' The Fortress of Liechtenstein Is Wobbling '
As the tax evasion scandal in Germany widens to the rest of Europe and even Australia and New Zealand , Liechtenstein finds itself in an uncomfortable spot .
German commentators predict tough times ahead for the tiny principality .
LOS ANGELES 
The wiretapping trial of Anthony Pellicano , the accused sleuth to the stars and irrepressible eavesdropper , has offered much fodder for celebrity watchers over its two - month run , including courtroom cameos by the comedians Chris Rock and Garry Shandling .
But the trial , which went to the jury last week , offered arguably more for people who enjoy talk of encryption software , code - wiping booby traps or the low - tech secrets of phone company networks .
It has brought into focus some startling technological revelations , provoked intriguing questions and even taught some lessons to technophiles  criminally inclined or not .
Here , through various witnesses , are a few of the disclosures :
Wiretapping is really , really easy .
And not just for the government .
Anyone sitting in on the Pellicano trial ( and staying awake during the telecom testimony ) could walk away ready to intercept phone calls after a quick stop at RadioShack for less than $ 50 in equipment .
Amateur spooks and crooks need only to learn which pair of wires , known as a cable pair , is associated with someone ’s phone number to tap it .
The wires can be found in a curbside neighborhood “ b- box , ” if you do n’t have the passkey to a central office .
( Mr. Pellicano routinely had photographs taken of the b-box nearest to a subject ’s location .
But prosecutors said he also had an accomplice visiting phone company central offices late at night . )
Every phone company service technician is given copies of two keys that can open nearly all of Southern California ’s b-boxes , and retired technicians apparently keep them .
Many boxes are not locked at all .
Central offices , which can be entered by technicians at all hours , are also often unsupervised .

In addition to Chamitoff , Discovery will drop off a few othernecessities for the space station , particularly for its orbital loo .
Last night a replacement pump arrived for amisbehaving toilet on the ISS ?s service module .
Ground crews loaded it into Discovery ?s middeck this morning around 3:30 a.m. EDT ( 0730 GMT ) , removing less urgent items such as spare wrenches , which will be brought up ona later mission .
The toilet has gone through three pumps already , with the lasttwo each working for only about a day .
? We ?re hoping this new pump won?t have this issue , ? said Kirk Shireman , NASA 's deputy program manager for the space station .
?
We ?re told [ the Russians ] went through a testing program and they believe this pump is functioning ?

Not -So-Safe - Deposit Boxes : States Seize Citizens ' Property to Balance Their Budgets
A woman says the state took her property and sold it for a fraction of its cost .
May 12 , 2008  --
The 50 U.S. states are holding more than $ 32 billion worth of unclaimed property that they 're supposed to safeguard for their citizens .
But a " Good Morning America " investigation found some states aggressively seize property that is n't really unclaimed and then use the money -- your money -- to balance their budgets .
Unclaimed property consists of things like forgotten apartment security deposits , uncashed dividend checks and safe - deposit boxes abandoned when an elderly relative dies .
Banks and other businesses are required to turn that property over to the state for safekeeping .
The problem is that the states return less than a quarter of unclaimed property to the rightful owners .
Not -So -Safe - Deposit Boxes
San Francisco resident Carla Ruff 's safe - deposit box was drilled , seized , and turned over to the state of California , marked " owner unknown . "
" I was appalled , " Ruff said .
" I felt violated . "
Unknown ?
Carla 's name was right on documents in the box at the Noe Valley Bank of America location .
So was her address -- a house about six blocks from the bank .
Carla had a checking account at the bank , too -- still does -- and receives regular statements .
Plus , she has receipts showing she 's the kind of person who paid her box rental fee .
And yet , she says nobody ever notified her .
" They are zealously uncovering accounts that are not unclaimed , " Ruff said .
To make matters worse , Ruff discovered the loss when she went to her box to retrieve important paperwork she needed because her husband was dying .
Those papers had been shredded .
And that 's not all .
Her great - grandmother 's precious natural pearls and other jewelry had been auctioned off .
They were sold for just $ 1,800 , even though they were appraised for $ 82,500 .
" These things were things that she gave to me , " Ruff said .
" I valued them because I loved her . "
Bank of America told ABC
News it deeply regrets the situation and appreciates the difficulty of what Mrs. Ruff was going through .
The bank has reached a settlement with Ruff and continues to update its unclaimed property procedures as laws change .
California 's Class Action Lawsuit
Ruff is not alone .
Attorney Bill Palmer represents her and countless other citizens in a class action lawsuit against the state of California .
" They figured the safety - deposit box was safer than keeping it under the mattress , " Palmer said .
" In the case of a lot of citizens , they were wrong , were n't they ? "
California law used to say property was unclaimed if the rightful owner had had no contact with the business for 15 years .
But during various state budget crises , the waiting period was reduced to seven years , and then five , and then three .
Legislators even tried for one year .
Why ?
Because the state wanted to use that free money .
" That 's absolutely correct , " said California State Controller John Chiang , who inherited the situation when he came into office .
" What we 've done here over the last two decades has been dead wrong .
We 've kept the property and not provided owners with the opportunities -- the best opportunities -- to get their property back . "
Chiang now faces the daunting task of returning $ 5.1 billion worth of unclaimed property to people .
Some states keep their unclaimed property in a special trust fund and only tap into the interest they earn on it .
But California dumps the money into the general fund -- and spends it .
" It 's supposed to be segregated and protected , " Palmer said .
" California has taken all of that $ 5.1 billion and has used it as a massive loan . "
California became so addicted to spending people 's money , that , for years , it simply stopped sending notices to the rightful owners .
ABC
News obtained a 1996 internal memo in which the lawyer for the Bureau of Unclaimed Property argued against expanding programs to notify rightful owners .
He wrote , " It could well result in additional claims of monies that would otherwise flow into the general fund . "
Seizing More Than Safe - Deposit Boxes
It 's not just safe - deposit boxes .
A British man went to retire and discovered the $ 4 million in U.S. stock he had been counting on had been seized and sold for $ 200,000 years earlier -- even though he was in touch with the company about other matters .
A Sacramento family lost out on railroad land rights their ancestors had owned for generations -- also sold off as unclaimed property .
" If I had hung onto it , I would be a millionaire , multimillionaire , " said John Whitley .
" But that did n't happen because we did n't get to hold it . "
State Reforms
California 's unclaimed property program was so out of control that , last year , the courts issued injunctions barring the state from seizing any more property until it made reforms .
Since then , Chiang has taken several steps to try to clean up the program .
For example , the state now sends notices alerting citizens about unclaimed property before it is handed over to the state -- the only state to do so .
Once unclaimed property is delivered to the state , it is now held for several months while the state tries to contact the owners , rather than it being immediately sold off or destroyed .
Which raises the question , in the Internet era , is anybody really lost anymore ?
California and other states are just beginning to make use of modern databases that can find most anyone in minutes .
Unfortunately , California only uses those databases to search after it has already seized a citizen 's property .
If California does get better at locating people , that could present another challenge .
Remember , right now , the state spends the money .
" It 's like the last guy in line at a pizza parlor , " Palmer criticized .
" There is only so much pizza .
At the end , when I get up to the counter to claim my pizza , there may be no pizza for me . "
California 's fiscal problems are legendary and once again in the news , so it 's reasonable to question whether the state can afford to repay its citizens if a bunch of them surface at once .
" There is always going to be money to give the owners when they make their claim , " Chiang insisted .
" I do n't want my legacy to say I continued a broken program .
I want my legacy to be ' this guy was the guy who truly cared about the people and returned their money . ' "
California is not the only state to come under fire for its handling of unclaimed property .
In Delaware , unclaimed property is the third largest source of state revenue .
Idaho recently passed an unprecedented law that says the state gets to keep unclaimed property permanently if the rightful owners do n't claim it within 10 short years .
And all 50 states pay private contractors 10 to 12 percent commissions to locate and seize accounts for them .
It 's an inherent conflict of interest : the more rightful owners are found , the less money the contractors make .
Of course , there are some states who handle their people 's property with respect .
Oregon never takes title to unclaimed property .
Instead , it holds it in a perpetual trust fund .
Colorado uses the interest on its unclaimed property fund to pay for some state programs , but leaves the principal untouched .
Missouri , Iowa and Kansas make extra efforts to reunite people with their property –even setting up booths at state fairs to get the word out .
The State of Maryland actively compares the names on unclaimed accounts with state income tax records .
If it finds a match , the state simply cuts a check and sends it to the citizen .
Protecting Your Property
So , the question for citizens is , how do you protect yourself ?

The Great Barrier Reef is a unique site with well - preserved natural beauty and unique features .
It is located in the north - east coast of Australia within the state of Queensland .
It is known as the largest coral reef system in the world consisting of 400 types of coral , and thousands of species of fish and mollusks .
If you want to have an unforgettable time exploring the beauty of Queensland in Australia , then you should travel to Great Barrier Reef .
There are several attractions in itself and is considered as one of the top diving sites in the world .
Due to its size and natural importance , the Great Barrier Reef was listed by UNESCO as a Heritage Site in 1981 .
This covers the entire 348,000 square kilometers that belong to the Great Barrier Reef .
The individual reefs ( all 2,500 of them ) in Great Barrier Reef vary in size and shapes ; meanwhile , the 900 islands in the reef system offer something different for travelers wherever they may choose to explore .
A certain part of the protected reef system is known as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park .
This part is limited to contact with humans to aid in preserving the reef system from human activity such as fishing or tourism .
However , it is undeniable that a lot of tourists travel to Great Barrier Reef to experience first - hand exactly what the reef system is about .
And the positive impact of the tourism industry is undeniable – the government earns billions annually from the tourists who travel to Great Barrier Reef .
When viewed from above , you will be in awe by the size and the magnitude of the seascapes .
The Whitsunday Islands is one of the most popular islands that tourists explore when they travel to Great Barrier Reef .
The island is best known for its green and vegetated island and the popular 7 Mile Beach known for its fine white sand .
There are also several cays on the Great Barrier Reef system that serve as breeding ground for marine species like turtles and seabirds .
What you see from above is only a glimpse of the heritage and natural beauty that the Great Barrier Reef is truly known for .
What lies beneath the water is more breathtaking and rich in terms of abundance in marine and coral reef system .
You will find a wide range of shapes , sizes , and colors of both soft and hard corals .
The same is true for the marine species that live in this massive coral reef system .
Did You Know … ?
Before you travel to Great Barrier Reef , here are some facts you need to know :
There are over 2 million tourists who travel to Great Barrier Reef .
This means that the Great Barrier Reef earns an approximate income of AUD 5 - 6 Billion annually .
This is the biggest coral reef system in the world with over 2,900 individual reefs .
There are over 900 islands that make up the Great Barrier Reef .
The islands make up a total of 2,600 kilometers .
The reef system is so large that it can be seen from the outer space .
The size of the entire reef system is bigger than the states of Victoria and Tasmania combined .
The Great Barrier Reef is larger than three European countries combined : UK , Holland , and Switzerland .
There are numerous species of animals found in the Great Barrier Reef including whales , dolphins , porpoises , sea turtles , seabirds , sea snakes , fish and more .
The entire system is so ancient that experts estimate it to be around for 20 million years .
There is a lot of beauty to enjoy at the Great Barrier Reef regardless of the time of year of your visit .
But for the best experience , avoid visiting sometime November to May because of the stinger season .
You would be required to swim inside stinger enclosures or while wearing a stinger suit .

NSD
( 202 ) 514-2007
TDD ( 202 ) 514-1888
National Security Division Launches New Office of Intelligence
WASHINGTON , D.C. – Patrick Rowan , Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security , today announced the formal launch of the Office of Intelligence within the Justice Department ’s National Security Division ( NSD ) .
The reorganization creates three new sections within the Office of Intelligence dedicated to the NSD ’s three primary intelligence related functions – operations , oversight and litigation .
The Department of Justice has played a critical role in the nation ’s effort to prevent acts of terrorism and to thwart hostile foreign intelligence activities .
Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the Department ’s Office of Intelligence Policy and Review ( OIPR ) has grown dramatically because of the steady increase in the number of applications it has handled under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) in an effort to ensure that Intelligence Community agencies have the authority necessary to conduct intelligence operations .
The creation of NSD in September 2006 brought OIPR under the umbrella of NSD and presented an opportunity to review the office ’s structure and expanding mission .
Based on this review , the NSD decided to modify the structure of the office , given that its intelligence staff has grown from fewer than 20 lawyers in 2000 to almost 100 today , and that its intelligence operations have increased with the rise in FISA caseload .
Moreover , the office has assumed an expanded role in conducting intelligence oversight and in coordinating FISA - related litigation .
To meet the needs of multi-faceted intelligence mission , the NSD developed a new structure called the Office of Intelligence , which is the successor to OIPR and consists of three specific sections aligned with the division ’s core functions : operations , oversight and litigation .
Each section is supervised by a chief who reports directly to Matt Olsen , the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Intelligence .
A description of each new section is below :
Operations Section :
The Operations Section handles NSD ’s intelligence operations workload , including representing the government before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .
The mission of the section is to ensure that the FBI and other intelligence community agencies have the legal tools necessary to conduct intelligence operations in adherence to the requirements and safeguards of the law .
The Justice Department is handling more requests for FISA authority than ever before .
From 2001 through 2007 , the annual number of FISA applications approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court rose from 934 to 2,370 .
Even with this increased workload , NSD has increased its efficiency in preparing and submitting applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , while ensuring that these applications are accurate and comply with the privacy protections in the FISA statute .
The formation of the Operations Section is necessary to ensure that the National Security Division enhances its capacity to meet the demands of this critical mission .
Oversight Section :
The NSD also faces increased responsibilities in its mission to conduct oversight of the intelligence and counterintelligence activities of the FBI , as well as those of other intelligence agencies , as appropriate , to ensure adherence to the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States .
In July 2007 , the Department announced that a significant new national security and oversight effort would be implemented by the NSD .
To meet this mandate , Justice Department attorneys for the first time have been given comprehensive authority to examine the FBI ’s national security program for adherence to all applicable laws , regulations , and guidelines .
In conjunction with the FBI ’s office of general counsel , NSD attorneys now review national security investigation files at the FBI to identify and provide guidance on a range of issues .
Among other things , the reviews examine FBI compliance with Attorney General national security guidelines , use of national security letters , predication for national security investigations , and referrals to the Intelligence Oversight Board .
NSD conducted 15 national security reviews at FBI offices in 2007 and plans to complete another 15 reviews in 2008 .
The mandate to perform these new oversight responsibilities , in addition to NSD ’s traditional FISA oversight functions , required the formation of a new Oversight Section dedicated to this mission .
Litigation Section :
With the lowering of the “ wall ” between intelligence and law enforcement investigations , and the enhanced coordination between intelligence and law enforcement personnel , NSD has seen a steady increase in the number of requests to use information from FISA - authorized activities as evidence in criminal prosecutions of terrorists and spies .
As a result , the NSD has created a separate Litigation Section to ensure sufficient resources are devoted to FISA - related litigation and to help prosecutors handle evidentiary and discovery issues in such matters .
The Litigation Section reviews and prepares requests for Attorney General authorization to use FISA information in criminal and non-criminal proceedings .
The section also drafts motions and briefs and responds to defense motions to disclose FISA applications and to suppress the fruits of FISA collection .
Finally , the section works to ensure the consistent application of FISA in trial and appellate courts nationwide .
To support this effort , the NSD in January 2008 developed a new policy , approved by the Attorney General , for investigators and prosecutors on the use of information obtained or derived from FISA collections .

AS A BOY , I PULLED OUT DOZENS — perhaps hundreds — of survey stakes in a vain effort to slow the bulldozers that were taking out my woods to make way for a new subdivision .
Had I known then what Ive since learned from a developer , that I should have simply moved the stakes around to be more effective , I would surely have done that too .
So you might imagine my dubiousness when , a few weeks after the publication of my 2005 book , Last Child in the Woods , I received an e-mail from Derek Thomas , who introduced himself as vice chairman and chief investment officer of Newland Communities , one of the nation ’s largest privately owned residential development companies .
“ I have been reading your new book , ” he wrote , “ and am profoundly disturbed by some of the information you present . ”
Thomas said he wanted to do something positive .
He invited me to an envisioning session in Phoenix to “ explore how Newland can improve or redefine our approach to open space preservation and the interaction between our homebuyers and nature . ”
A few weeks later , in a conference room filled with about eighty developers , builders , and real estate marketers , I offered my sermonette .
The folks in the crowd were partially responsible for the problem , I suggested , because they destroy natural habitat , design communities in ways that discourage any real contact with nature , and include covenants that virtually criminalize outdoor play — outlawing tree - climbing , fort - building , even chalk - drawing on sidewalks .
I was ready to make a fast exit when Thomas , a bearded man with an avuncular demeanor , stood up and said , “ I want you all to go into small groups and solve the problem : how are we going to build communities in the future that actually connect kids with nature ? ”
The room filled with noise and excitement .
By the time the groups reassembled to report the ideas they had generated , I had glimpsed the primal power of connecting children and nature : it can inspire unexpected advocates and lure unlikely allies to enter an entirely new place .
Call it the doorway effect .
Once through the door , they can revisualize seemingly intractable problems and produce solutions they might otherwise never have imagined .
A half hour after Thomas ’s challenge , the groups reported their ideas .
Among them : leave some land and native habitat in place ( that ’s a good start ) ; employ green design principles ; incorporate nature trails and natural waterways ; throw out the conventional covenants and restrictions that discourage or prohibit natural play and rewrite the rules to encourage it ; allow kids to build forts and tree houses or plant gardens ; and create small , on - site nature centers .
“ Kids could become guides , using cell phones , along nature trails that lead to schools at the edge of the development , ” someone suggested .
Were the men and women in this room just blowing smoke ?
Maybe .
Developers exploiting our hunger for nature , I thought , just as they market their subdivisions by naming their streets after the trees and streams that they destroy .
But the fact that developers , builders , and real estate marketers would approach Derek Thomas ’s question with such apparently heartfelt enthusiasm was revealing .
The quality of their ideas mattered less than the fact that they had them .
While they may not get there themselves , the people in this room were visualizing a very different future .
They were undergoing a process of discovery that has proliferated around the country in the past two years , and not only among developers .
For decades , environmental educators , conservationists , and others have worked , often heroically , to bring more children to nature — usually with inadequate support from policymakers .
A number of trends , including the recent unexpected national media attention to Last Child and “ nature - deficit disorder , ” have now brought the concerns of these veteran advocates before a broader audience .
While some may argue that the word “ movement ” is hyperbole , we do seem to have reached a tipping point .
State and regional campaigns , sometimes called Leave No Child Inside , have begun to form in Cincinnati , Cleveland , Chicago , the San Francisco Bay Area , St. Louis , Connecticut , Florida , Colorado , Texas , and elsewhere .
A host of related initiatives — among them the simple - living , walkable - cities , nature - education , and land - trust movements — have begun to find common cause , and collective strength , through this issue .
The activity has attracted a diverse assortment of people who might otherwise never work together .
In September 2006 , the National Conservation Training Center and the Conservation Fund hosted the National Dialogue on Children and Nature in Shepherdstown , West Virginia .
The conference drew some 350 people from around the country , representing educators , health - care experts , recreation companies , residential developers , urban planners , conservation agencies , academics , and other groups .
Even the Walt Disney Company was represented .
Support has also come from religious leaders , liberal and conservative , who understand that all spiritual life begins with a sense of wonder , and that one of the first windows to wonder is the natural world .
“ Christians should take the lead in reconnecting with nature and disconnecting from machines , ” writes R. Albert Mohler Jr. , president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary , the flagship school of the Southern Baptist Convention .
To some extent , the movement is fueled by organizational or economic self - interest .
But something deeper is going on here .
With its nearly universal appeal , this issue seems to hint at a more atavistic motivation .
It may have something to do with what Harvard professor E. O. Wilson calls the biophilia hypothesis , which is that human beings are innately attracted to nature : biologically , we are all still hunters and gatherers , and there is something in us , which we do not fully understand , that needs an occasional immersion in nature .
We do know that when people talk about the disconnect between children and nature — if they are old enough to remember a time when outdoor play was the norm — they almost always tell stories about their own childhoods : this tree house or fort , that special woods or ditch or creek or meadow .
They recall those “ places of initiation , ” in the words of naturalist Bob Pyle , where they may have first sensed with awe and wonder the largeness of the world seen and unseen .
When people share these stories , their cultural , political , and religious walls come tumbling down .
And when that happens , ideas can pour forth — and lead to ever more insightful approaches .
It ’s a short conceptual leap , for example , from the notions generated by Derek Thomas ’s working group to the creation of a truly sustainable development like the pioneering Village Homes , in Davis , California , where suburban homes are pointed inward toward open green space , vegetable gardens are encouraged , and orchards , not gates or walls , surround the community .
And from there , rather than excusing more sprawl with a green patina , developers might even encourage the green redevelopment of portions of strip - mall America into Dutch - style eco-communities , where nature would be an essential strand in the fabric of the urban neighborhood .
In similar ways , the leave - no - child - inside movement could become one of the best ways to challenge other entrenched conceptions — for example , the current , test - centric definition of education reform .
Bring unlike - minded people through the doorway to talk about the effect of society ’s nature - deficit on child development , and pretty soon they ’ll be asking hard questions :
Just why have school districts canceled field trips and recess and environmental education ?
And why does n’t our school have windows that open and natural light ?
At a deeper level , when we challenge schools to incorporate place - based learning in the natural world , we will help students realize that school is n’t supposed to be a polite form of incarceration , but a portal to the wider world .
All this may be wishful thinking , of course , at least in the short run .
But as Martin Luther King Jr. often said , the success of any social movement depends on its ability to show a world where people will want to go .
The point is that thinking about children ’s need for nature helps us begin to paint a picture of that world — which is something that has to be done , because the price of not painting that picture is too high .
Within the space of a few decades , the way children understand and experience their neighborhoods and the natural world has changed radically .
Even as children and teenagers become more aware of global threats to the environment , their physical contact , their intimacy with nature , is fading .
As one suburban fifth grader put it to me , in what has become the signature epigram of the children - and - nature movement : “ I like to play indoors better ’ cause that ’s where all the electrical outlets are . ”
His desire is not at all uncommon .
In a typical week , only 6 percent of children ages nine to thirteen play outside on their own .
Studies by the National Sporting Goods Association and by American Sports Data , a research firm , show a dramatic decline in the past decade in such outdoor activities as swimming and fishing .
Even bike riding is down 31 percent since 1995 .
In San Diego , according to a survey by the nonprofit Aquatic Adventures , 90 percent of inner-city kids do not know how to swim ; 34 percent have never been to the beach .
In suburban Fort Collins , Colorado , teachers shake their heads in dismay when they describe the many students who have never been to the mountains visible year - round on the western horizon .
Urban , suburban , and even rural parents cite a number of everyday reasons why their children spend less time in nature than they themselves did , including disappearing access to natural areas , competition from television and computers , dangerous traffic , more homework , and other pressures .
Most of all , parents cite fear of stranger - danger .
Conditioned by round - the - clock news coverage , they believe in an epidemic of abductions by strangers , despite evidence that the number of child - snatchings ( about a hundred a year ) has remained roughly the same for two decades , and that the rates of violent crimes against young people have fallen to well below 1975 levels .
Yes , there are risks outside our homes .
But there are also risks in raising children under virtual protective house arrest : threats to their independent judgment and value of place , to their ability to feel awe and wonder , to their sense of stewardship for the Earth — and , most immediately , threats to their psychological and physical health .
The rapid increase in childhood obesity leads many health - care leaders to worry that the current generation of children may be the first since World War II to die at an earlier age than their parents .
Getting kids outdoors more , riding bikes , running , swimming — and , especially , experiencing nature directly — could serve as an antidote to much of what ails the young .
The physical benefits are obvious , but other benefits are more subtle and no less important .
Take the development of cognitive functioning .
Factoring out other variables , studies of students in California and nationwide show that schools that use outdoor classrooms and other forms of experiential education produce significant student gains in social studies , science , language arts , and math .
One 2005 study by the California Department of Education found that students in outdoor science programs improved their science testing scores by 27 percent .
And the benefits go beyond test scores .
According to a range of studies , children in outdoor - education settings show increases in self - esteem , problem solving , and motivation to learn .
“ Natural spaces and materials stimulate children ’s limitless imaginations , ” says Robin Moore , an international authority on the design of environments for children ’s play , learning , and education , “ and serve as the medium of inventiveness and creativity . ”
Studies of children in schoolyards with both green areas and manufactured play areas have found that children engaged in more creative forms of play in the green areas , and they also played more cooperatively .
Recent research also shows a positive correlation between the length of children ’s attention spans and direct experience in nature .
Studies at the University of Illinois show that time in natural settings significantly reduces symptoms of attention - deficit ( hyperactivity ) disorder in children as young as age five .
The research also shows the experience helps reduce negative stress and protects psychological well being , especially in children undergoing the most stressful life events .
Even without corroborating evidence or institutional help , many parents notice significant changes in their children ’s stress levels and hyperactivity when they spend time outside .
“ My son is still on Ritalin , but he ’s so much calmer in the outdoors that we ’re seriously considering moving to the mountains , ” one mother tells me .
Could it simply be that he needs more physical activity ?
“ No , he gets that , in sports , ” she says .
Similarly , the back page of an October issue of San Francisco magazine displays a vivid photograph of a small boy , eyes wide with excitement and joy , leaping and running on a great expanse of California beach , storm clouds and towering waves behind him .
A short article explains that the boy was hyperactive , he had been kicked out of his school , and his parents had not known what to do with him — but they had observed how nature engaged and soothed him .
So for years they took their son to beaches , forests , dunes , and rivers to let nature do its work .
The photograph was taken in 1907 .
The boy was Ansel Adams .
Last spring , I found myself wandering down a path toward the Milwaukee River , where it runs through the urban Riverside Park .
At first glance , there was nothing unusual about the young people I encountered .
A group of modern inner-city high school students , they dressed in standard hip - hop fashion .
I would have expected to see in their eyes the cynicism so fashionable now , the jaded look of what D. H. Lawrence long ago called the “ know - it - all state of mind . ”
But not today .
Casting their fishing lines from the muddy bank of the Milwaukee River , they were laughing with pleasure .
They were totally immersed in the fishing , delighted by the lazy brown river and the landscape of the surrounding park , designed in the late nineteenth century by Frederick Law Olmsted , the founder of American landscape architecture .
Ducking a few backcasts , I walked through the woods to the two - story Urban Ecology Center , made of lumber recycled from abandoned buildings .
When this Milwaukee park was established it was a tree - lined valley , with a waterfall , a hill for sledding , and places for skating and swimming , fishing and boating .
But when adjacent Riverside High School was expanded in the 1970s , some of the topography was flattened to create sports fields .
Industrial and other pollution made the river unfit for human contact , park maintenance declined , and crime became a problem .
Then , in the early 1990s , something remarkable happened .
A retired biophysicist started a small outdoor - education program in the abandoned park .
A dam on the river was removed in 1997 , and natural water flow flushed out contaminants .
Following a well - established pattern , crime decreased as more people used the park .
Over the years , the outdoor - education program evolved into the nonprofit Urban Ecology Center , which annually hosts more than eighteen thousand student visits from twenty - three schools in the surrounding neighborhoods .
The center ’s director , Ken Leinbach , a former science teacher , was giving me a tour .
“ Many teachers would like to use outdoor classrooms , but they do n’t feel they ’re trained adequately .
When the schools partner with us , they do n’t have to worry about training , ” he said .
An added benefit : the center welcomes kids from the surrounding neighborhood , so they no longer associate the woods only with danger , but with joy and exploration as well .
Later , we climbed to the top of a wooden tower , high above the park .
Leinbach explained that the tower creates the impression that someone is watching over the kids — literally .
“ From up here , I once tracked and gave phone reports to the police about a driver who was trying to hit people on the bike path , ” he said , looking across the treetops .
“ Except for that incident , no serious violent crime has occurred in the park in the past five years .
We see environmental education as a great tool for urban revitalization . ”
Even as it shows how nature can be better woven into cities , the Urban Ecology Center also helps paint a portrait of an educational future that many of us would like to see : every school connected to an outdoor classroom , as school districts partner with nature centers , nature preserves , ranches , and farms , to create the new schoolyards .
Such a future is embodied in the nature - themed schools that have begun sprouting up nationwide , like the Schlitz Audubon Nature Center Preschool , where , as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in April 2006 , “ a 3 - year - old can identify a cedar tree and a maple — even if she can’t tell you what color pants she ’s wearing .
And a 4 - year - old can tell the difference between squirrel and rabbit tracks — even if he ca n’t yet read any of the writing on a map .
Young children learn through the sounds , scents , and seasons of the outdoors . ”
Taking cues from the preschool ’s success in engaging children , an increasing number of nature centers are looking to add preschool programs not only to meet the demand for early childhood education but also to “ create outdoor enthusiasts at a young age , ” the Journal Sentinel reported .
And their success points to a doorway into the larger challenge — to better care for the health of the Earth .
Studies show that almost to a person conservationists or environmentalists — whatever we want to call them — had some transcendent experience in nature when they were children .
For some , the epiphanies took place in a national park ; for others , in the clump of trees at the end of the cul - de-sac .
But if experiences in nature are radically reduced for future generations , where will stewards of the Earth come from ?
A few months ago , I visited Ukiah , California , a mountain town nestled in the pines and fog .
Ukiah is Spotted Owl Central , a town associated with the swirling controversy regarding logging , old growth , and endangered species .
This is one of the most bucolic landscapes in our country , but local educators and parents report that Ukiah kids are n’t going outside much anymore .
So who will care about the spotted owl in ten or fifteen years ?
Federal and state conservation agencies are asking such questions with particular urgency .
The reason : though the roads at some U.S. national parks remain clogged , overall visits by Americans have dropped by 25 percent since 1987 , few people get far from their cars , and camping is on the decline .
And such trends may further reduce political support for parks .
In October 2006 , the superintendent of Yellowstone National Park joined the cadre of activists around the country calling for a no - child - left - inside campaign to make children more comfortable with the outdoors .
In a similar move , the U.S. Forest Service is launching More Kids in the Woods , which would fund local efforts to get children outdoors .
Nonprofit environmental organizations are also showing a growing interest in how children engage with nature .
In early 2006 , the Sierra Club intensified its commitment to connecting children to nature through its Inner City Outings program for at - risk youths , and it has ramped up its legislative efforts in support of environmental education .
The National Wildlife Federation is rolling out the Green Hour , a national campaign to persuade parents to encourage their children to spend one hour a day in nature .
John Flicker , president of the National Audubon Society , is campaigning for the creation of a family - focused nature center in every congressional district in the nation .
“ Once these centers are embedded , they ’re almost impossible to kill , ” says Flicker .
“ They help create a political constituency right now , but also build a future political base for conservation . ”
Proponents of a new San Diego Regional Canyonlands Park , which would protect the city ’s unique web of urban canyons , have adjusted their efforts to address these younger constituents .
“ In addition to the other arguments to do this , such as protecting wildlife , ” says Eric Bowlby , Sierra Club Canyons Campaign coordinator , “ we ’ve been talking about the health and educational benefits of these canyons to kids .
People who may not care about endangered species do care about their kids ’ health . ”
For conservationists , it could be a small step from initiatives like these to the idea of dedicating a portion of any proposed open space to children and families in the surrounding area .
The acreage could include nature centers , which ideally would provide outdoor - oriented preschools and other offerings .
Of course , such programs must teach children how to step lightly on natural habitats , especially ones with endangered species .
But the outdoor experiences of children are essential for the survival of conservation .
And so the truth is that the human child in nature may be the most important indicator species of future sustainability .
The future of children in nature has profound implications not only for the conservation of land but also for the direction of the environmental movement .
If society embraces something as simple as the health benefits of nature experiences for children , it may begin to re-evaluate the worth of “ the environment . ”
While public - health experts have traditionally associated environmental health with the absence of toxic pollution , the definition fails to account for an equally valid consideration : how the environment can improve human health .
Seen through that doorway , nature is n’t a problem , it ’s the solution : environmentalism is essential to our own well - being .
Howard Frumkin , director of the National Center for Environmental Health , points out that future research about the positive health effects of nature should be conducted in collaboration with architects , urban planners , park designers , and landscape architects .
“ Perhaps we will advise patients to take a few days in the country , to spend time gardening , ” he wrote in a 2001 American Journal of Preventive Medicine article , “ or [ we will ] build hospitals in scenic locations , or plant gardens in rehabilitation centers .
Perhaps the . . . organizations that pay for health care will come to fund such interventions , especially if they prove to rival pharmaceuticals in cost and efficacy . ”
Here ’s one suggestion for how to accelerate that change , starting with children : nationally and internationally , pediatricians and other health professionals could use office posters , pamphlets , and personal persuasion to promote the physical and mental health benefits of nature play .
Such publicity would give added muscle to efforts to reduce child obesity .
Ideally , health providers would add nature therapy to the traditional approaches to attention - deficit disorders and childhood depression .
This effort might be modeled on the national physical - fitness campaign launched by President John F. Kennedy .
We could call the campaign “ Grow Outside ! ”
In every arena , from conservation and health to urban design and education , a growing children - and - nature movement will have no shortage of tools to bring about a world in which we leave no child inside — and no shortage of potential far - reaching benefits .
Under the right conditions , cultural and political change can occur rapidly .
The recycling and antismoking campaigns are our best examples of how social and political pressure can work hand - in - hand to create a societal transformation in just one generation .
The children - and - nature movement has perhaps even greater potential — because it touches something even deeper within us , biologically and spiritually .
In January 2005 , I attended a meeting of the Quivira Coalition , a New Mexico organization that brings together ranchers and environmentalists to find common ground .
The coalition is now working on a plan to promote ranches as the new schoolyards .
When my turn came to speak , I told the audience how , when I was a boy , I pulled out all those survey stakes in an attempt to keep the earthmovers at bay .
Afterward , a rancher stood up .
He was wearing scuffed boots .
His aged jeans had never seen acid wash , only dirt and rock .
His face was sunburned and creased .
His drooping moustache was white , and he wore thick eyeglasses with heavy plastic frames , stained with sweat .
“ You know that story you told about pulling up stakes ? ” he said .
“ I did that when I was a boy , too . ”
The crowd laughed .
I laughed .
And then the man began to cry .
Despite his embarrassment , he continued to speak , describing the source of his sudden grief : that he might belong to one of the last generations of Americans to feel that sense of ownership of land and nature .
The power of this movement lies in that sense , that special place in our hearts , those woods where the bulldozers cannot reach .
Developers and environmentalists , corporate CEOs and college professors , rock stars and ranchers may agree on little else , but they agree on this : no one among us wants to be a member of the last generation to pass on to its children the joy of playing outside in nature .

Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death Patrick Henry , March 23 , 1775 .
No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism , as well as abilities , of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House .
But different men often see the same subject in different lights ; and , therefore , I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if , entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs , I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve .
This is no time for ceremony .
The questing before the House is one of awful moment to this country .
For my own part , I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery ; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate .
It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth , and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country .
Should I keep back my opinions at such a time , through fear of giving offense , I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country , and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven , which I revere above all earthly kings .
Mr. President , it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope .
We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth , and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts .
Is this the part of wise men , engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty ?
Are we disposed to be of the number of those who , having eyes , see not , and , having ears , hear not , the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation ?
For my part , whatever anguish of spirit it may cost , I am willing to know the whole truth ; to know the worst , and to provide for it .
I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided , and that is the lamp of experience .
I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past .
And judging by the past , I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House .
Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received ?
Trust it not , sir ; it will prove a snare to your feet .
Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss .
Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land .
Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation ?
Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love ?
Let us not deceive ourselves , sir .
These are the implements of war and subjugation ; the last arguments to which kings resort .
I ask gentlemen , sir , what means this martial array , if its purpose be not to force us to submission ?
Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it ?
Has Great Britain any enemy , in this quarter of the world , to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies ?
No , sir , she has none .
They are meant for us : they can be meant for no other .
They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging .
And what have we to oppose to them ?
Shall we try argument ?
Sir , we have been trying that for the last ten years .
Have we anything new to offer upon the subject ?
Nothing .
We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable ; but it has been all in vain .
Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication ?
What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted ?
Let us not , I beseech you , sir , deceive ourselves .
Sir , we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on .
We have petitioned ; we have remonstrated ; we have supplicated ; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne , and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament .
Our petitions have been slighted ; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult ; our supplications have been disregarded ; and we have been spurned , with contempt , from the foot of the throne !
In vain , after these things , may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation .
There is no longer any room for hope .
If we wish to be free -- if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending -- if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged , and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained -- we must fight !
I repeat it , sir , we must fight !
An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left us !
They tell us , sir , that we are weak ; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary .
But when shall we be stronger ?
Will it be the next week , or the next year ?
Will it be when we are totally disarmed , and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house ?
Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction ?
Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope , until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot ?
Sir , we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power .
The millions of people , armed in the holy cause of liberty , and in such a country as that which we possess , are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us .
Besides , sir , we shall not fight our battles alone .
There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations , and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us .
The battle , sir , is not to the strong alone ; it is to the vigilant , the active , the brave .
Besides , sir , we have no election .
If we were base enough to desire it , it is now too late to retire from the contest .
There is no retreat but in submission and slavery !
Our chains are forged !
Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston !
The war is inevitable -- and let it come !
I repeat it , sir , let it come .
It is in vain , sir , to extenuate the matter .
Gentlemen may cry , Peace , Peace -- but there is no peace .
The war is actually begun !
The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms !
Our brethren are already in the field !
Why stand we here idle ?
What is it that gentlemen wish ?
What would they have ?
Is life so dear , or peace so sweet , as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery ?
Forbid it , Almighty God !
I know not what course others may take ; but as for me , give me liberty or give me death !

Linkoy Muhuri , who raped a frail mother of three , claims he faces dangers in his own country
A man who raped a frail mother of three while HIV positive is trying to escape deportation .
Linkoy Muhuri , a failed asylum seeker from the Congo , claims he faces dangers in his own country because of his medical condition and his ethnicity .
The former hairdresser , 40 , was jailed for ten years after attacking the Aids counsellor , 34 , who has sickle cell anaemia and had her feet covered in bandages at the time .
During his prison sentence , he has been eligible for free treatment for HIV worth tens of thousands of pounds .
Despite a judge recommending him for deportation on his release , his wife and two children were allowed to stay in Britain so they could visit him .
Muhuri , who came to Britain in 1999 , has now served his sentence .
But appearing before an Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in Brentford , West London , yesterday he produced more reasons as to why he should be allowed to stay .
As well as medical and family reasons , his lawyer secured him a two - month reprieve by arguing that his " ethnicity " could put him in danger in the Congo .
While his father is Congolese , his mother is Rwandan and may have been involved in politics , the tribunal heard .
Muhuri , who is understood to be a Hutu , also claims he was tortured in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for his political views .
He was originally denied asylum because Home Office officials did not believe he was fleeing for his life .
Yesterday , immigration judge Lynn Verity delayed the full deportation hearing until June to give the Home Office the opportunity - if it wished - to look into Muhuri 's latest claim .
She added that a full four - hour hearing would be required to hear all the " complex issues " in his case , including his " medical issue " and the " regard to family life " .
" This is not part - heard , we have n't even started yet , " she said .
During the hearing Muhuri , who was dressed smartly in a suit and tie , glanced at two women , believed to include his wife , in the public gallery .
Grace Brown , for Muhuri , said he felt the " interests of justice " may not be served if the Home Office were not given time to review his claim .
Muhuri raped his victim seven years ago , three and a half months after marrying his girlfriend Nothemba Jozi in North London .
He lived in Tottenham at the time .
It will be up to the asylum and immigration panel to make a final decision on deportation .
However , Muhuri could then still appeal .
QQ
I just returned from a trip to Shanghai , and in case you did n't know anyway , here 's my No. 1 insight : China scales .
Let 's take QQ.com as an example , the leading Chinese online social network .
The site is reported to have more than 300 million active accounts .
That is eight times the member base of Facebook -- and it 's the same size as the U.S. population .
What 's also remarkable ( and different from the Western social networks ) is QQ 's monetization .
Facebook posted revenue of $ 150 million for 2007 ( and according to Plus8 star a loss of $ 50 million ) ; MySpace.com ( purchased by News Corp. for $ 560 million ) is projected to generate $ 750 million in revenue this year ; and Bebo ( purchased by AOL for $ 850 million ) had revenue of just $ 20 million in 2007 .
While QQ reported revenue of $ 523 million and an astonishing operating profit of $ 224 million in 2007 .
The revenue distribution is unusual , too : 60 percent of the revenue came from services like games , an additional 21 percent from mobile services like ringtones , and only 13 percent from online advertising .
Do added value services trump ad based revenue models ?
When delegates to the Republican National Convention assembled in New York in August 2004 , the streets and sidewalks near Union Square and Madison Square Garden filled with demonstrators .
Police officers in helmets formed barriers by stretching orange netting across intersections .
Hordes of bicyclists participated in rolling protests through nighttime streets , and helicopters hovered overhead .
These tableaus and others were described as they happened in text messages that spread from mobile phone to mobile phone in New York City and beyond .
The people sending and receiving the messages were using technology , developed by an anonymous group of artists and activists called the Institute for Applied Autonomy , that allowed users to form networks and transmit messages to hundreds or thousands of telephones .
Although the service , called TXTmob , was widely used by demonstrators , reporters and possibly even police officers , little was known about its inventors .
Last month , however , the New York City Law Department issued a subpoena to Tad Hirsch , a doctoral candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who wrote the code that created TXTmob .
Lawyers representing the city in lawsuits filed by hundreds of people arrested during the convention asked Mr. Hirsch to hand over voluminous records revealing the content of messages exchanged on his service and identifying people who sent and received messages .
Mr. Hirsch says that some of the subpoenaed material no longer exists and that he believes he has the right to keep other information secret .
If the government is n't spying on you , then why should you care about whether the government follows wiretapping laws ?
That 's a complicated and much - asked question , one that this reporter totally flubbed on a not - to - be named NPR show that thinks it 's cool to pretend that news is hard .
Reason magazine contributing editor Julian Sanchez , however , did much better in print in this Sunday 's Los Angeles Times .
After a short history of politically motivated spying – including examples I 'd long forgotten or never known , Sanchez explains why spying laws matter , even if you never say anything the spooks would want to hear anyways .
It 's probably true that ordinary citizens uninvolved in political activism have little reason to fear being spied on , just as most Americans seldom need to invoke their 1st Amendment right to freedom of speech .
But we understand that the 1st Amendment serves a dual role :
It protects the private right to speak your mind , but it serves an even more important structural function , ensuring open debate about matters of public importance .
You might not care about that first function if you do n't plan to say anything controversial .
But anyone who lives in a democracy , who is subject to its laws and affected by its policies , ought to care about the second .
Harvard University legal scholar William Stuntz has argued that the framers of the Constitution viewed the 4th Amendment as a mechanism for protecting political dissent .
In England , agents of the crown had ransacked the homes of pamphleteers critical of the king – something the founders resolved that the American system would not countenance .
In that light , the security - versus - privacy framing of the contemporary FISA debate seems oddly incomplete .
Your personal phone calls and e-mails may be of limited interest to the spymasters of Langley and Ft. Meade .
But if you think an executive branch unchecked by courts wo n't turn its " national security " surveillance powers to political ends – well , it would be a first .
I 've always thought of the importance of the laws as being about the architecture of the spying apparatus .
Meaning that the difference between a democratic regime with unfettered access to the nation 's communication tools and an despotic regime with the same access is simply good will .
And good will rarely stops the momentum of a bureaucracy convinced it knows best .
Or if you let me , good will is no Hoover dam .

Refused by His City , Man Jailed for Painting a Crosswalk
Whitney Stump ’s homemade crosswalk , as seen on Google Maps
Whitney Stump was tired of drivers ignoring stop signs at an intersection in his Muncie , Indiana neighborhood .
After futile attempts to get the city to install crosswalks , Stump took matters into his own hands and painted one in at the corner of Dicks and North streets .
Then he got arrested .
WRTV in Indianapolis reports :
Stump , a 27 - year - old Ball State University graduate student and father ,
says he was arrested in July on a charge of criminal mischief for
creating the crosswalk at the intersection of Dicks and North streets .
A police officer then warned him after he went back to touch up the
paint in August , and the county prosecutor decided to charge him again .
" If they ’re not going to provide a safe environment for me and my community , then I believe I have a moral obligation , " Stump told 6 News ’ Ray Cortopassi on Wednesday .
Stump said he first asked the city to do the job , thinking crosswalks would get drivers ’ attentions and make them aware they needed to slow down .
" I called the street and sign department probably a half - dozen times in the course of six months ( to ) a year , " he said .
The city of Muncie says the intersection in question does n’t meet the criteria for crosswalk installation because it is n’t near a school .
Stump missed a court date after he was charged the second time , which led to a 10 - hour jail stint .
But he says he plans to paint in additional crosswalks at the other three spokes of Dicks and North .
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) -
Two scuba divers , a British man and an American woman , were rescued on Saturday after drifting for 20 hours off Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef after they became separated from their dive party .
A rescue helicopter spotted the divers drifting about 7.8 nautical miles north - west of Bait Reef , winched them aboard and flew them to a nearby resort island , police said .
“ I ’m quite surprised , they are in such great condition , ” a helicopter rescue official told local radio .
“ It was quite amazing , with over 20 hours in the ocean to not have more exposure , but I guess the wetsuits just kept them warm enough during the night .
Possibly they had some fresh water on them and they did n’t get too sunburnt during the afternoon . ”
The two , part of a party of six divers on a charter boat , became separated on Friday afternoon and drifted some eight nautical miles during the night .
Police said the pair were diving in a small inlet called Gary ’s Lagoon when they failed to resurface as scheduled .
The dive boat crew started a search , alerting police when they failed to find any trace of the missing divers .
Three aircraft , including a specialized search and rescue plane with forward looking infra-red equipment , searched overnight for the pair .
The search was expanded on Saturday with seven helicopters and three aircraft looking for the pair .

Hans Reiser is the victim of a " screw job " perpetrated by his wife and " shading " of circumstantial evidence by prosecutors who insist he killed her even though her body has n't been found , his attorney told jurors Thursday .
Reiser is being railroaded by both Nina Reiser , who married him so she could immigrate to the United States from her native Russia , and a prosecutor who has no real evidence , defense attorney William Du Bois said in the second day of his closing argument in Alameda County Superior Court .
As he did Wednesday , Du Bois compared his client to the odd - looking duck - billed platypus to emphasize his belief that even though Reiser , 44 , can come across as strange and obnoxious , that does n't mean he murdered his wife .
" I was trying to think recently how a platypus could even evolve , " Du Bois said .
" It must have been a genetic mistake .
That 's why it reminded me of ... "
Du Bois ' voice trailed off as he turned his head and gave a disdainful look at his client , prompting laughter in Judge Larry Goodman 's Oakland courtroom .
Nina Reiser was 31 when she disappeared Sept. 3 , 2006 , after dropping off her children at her husband 's Oakland hills home .
Her body has n't been found , and Du Bois has told jurors that she could be alive and living anywhere in Europe .
Her children are living with their maternal grandmother in St. Petersburg , Russia .
If Nina Reiser is dead , others could have killed her , Du Bois told the jury .
Oakland police failed to conduct a proper investigation of Sean Sturgeon , Hans Reiser 's best friend until he had an extramarital affair with Nina Reiser , the attorney said .
Nor did authorities look into whether there had been any " sexual trysts " between Nina Reiser and men she may have met through online Craigslist ads , he said .
" Not one of them was contacted by the Oakland police - that would be inconsistent with the theory that they ultimately wanted to bring , " Du Bois said .
" We do n't know if ( Nina Reiser ) had a prearranged plan to meet with one of them when she left Hans ' house ( the day she was last seen ) , or had prearranged plans to meet Sean Sturgeon when she left Hans ' house , " the defense attorney said .
Du Bois said Hans Reiser is the victim of " one of the great screw jobs , " perpetrated by his wife .
" It 's easy to screw a platypus , " he said .
The defense put a picture of a platypus on the screen in court .
On Wednesday , Du Bois repeatedly held up a stuffed - animal platypus .
Du Bois said many of Hans Reiser 's actions after his wife disappeared , such as using a hose to spray the interior of his mother 's Honda CRX and remove the car 's passenger seat , were n't meant to hide or destroy evidence .
" As a matter of fact , his conduct is equally as consistent with someone who is naive , paranoid - but not guilty - as it is with someone who is guilty , " Du Bois said .
" When you think about it , Hans did nothing irrational , as the prosecutor said , or impulsive . "
Reiser , a computer programmer who founded his own company , " thinks about everything , " Du Bois said .
He said police and prosecutors cherry - picked certain points to make Reiser look guilty .
" There 's a shading that happens , " Du Bois said .
" Sometimes , shading can be the difference between life and death . "
Prosecutor Paul Hora was trying to evoke the Scott Peterson case in emphasizing the fact that Reiser was carrying thousands of dollars in his fanny pack when officers detained him for a DNA sample and also when he was arrested , Du Bois said .
Peterson , too , was carrying a large amount of cash when he was arrested for killing his wife , Laci , and her fetus .
Hora has argued to jurors that they could disregard all of Reiser 's testimony because he lied on the stand when he said he had never removed the battery from his cell phone to avoid being tracked .
Du Bois told the jurors Thursday that if they use that standard , then they should also reject testimony by Nina Reiser 's mother , Irina Sharanova .
Sharanova lied on the stand when she denied having coached her grandson before he testified , Du Bois said .
Du Bois dismissed testimony by a police criminalist who said bloodstains containing Nina Reiser 's DNA had been found on a pillar in her husband 's home and on a sleeping bag sack in his car .
There 's no way to tell when or how her DNA got on the pillar - which also contained the defendant 's DNA - and she could have drooled on the sleeping bag sack , Du Bois said .
" You can't convict a man on murder based on the prosecution 's suggestion that perhaps the sleeping bag picked up on this very weak sample from something that was on the floor of the car , " Du Bois said .
" There 's no evidence , none . "
The trial is in recess today .
Du Bois is expected to finish his argument Monday , after which Hora will provide a rebuttal argument .
The judge will then give the jury instructions and the panel will begin deliberating .

In the category of things that sound so good they have to be checked out more thoroughly ( so stay tuned ) is this news out of Los Alamos National Laboratory :
Scientists there say they have developed a way to produce truly carbon - neutral fuel and useful organic chemicals at large scale using water and carbon dioxide removed from the air as raw materials .
There are plenty of schemes brewing to capture carbon dioxide , both directly from the atmosphere and from the stacks of power plants .
All of them , for the moment , are costly or hard to envision at the billion - tons - a - year scale that would be needed to blunt the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere coming mainly from fuel burning .
UPDATE : 2/13 , 5 p.m. :
This plan has a minor hurdle , too ; the electricity for driving the chemical processes , according to a white paper describing the overarching concept , would come from nuclear power .
The proposal says it ’d be worth it to have a payoff of steady , secure streams of methanol and gasoline with no carbon added to the atmosphere ( and a price for gasoline at the pump of perhaps $ 4.60 a gallon — comparable to petroleum - based fuels as oil becomes harder to find ) .
At least one process for using CO2 to make fuel , developed by a team led by George A. Olah , a Nobel laureate at the University of Southern California , bears some resemblance to the fuel - generating part of the Los Alamos proposal .
One selling point with Los Alamos ’s “ Green Freedom ” concept , and similar ones , is that reusing the carbon atoms in the captured CO2 molecules as a fuel ingredient avoids the need to find huge repositories for the greenhouse gas .
The lab ’s researchers , led by F. Jeffrey Martin , say their system could process vast volumes of air using existing giant structures like the cooling towers at nuclear power plants .
No need to chop down rain forests or compete with food crops to grow carbon - grabbing fuel crops like corn or switchgrass .
Roger A. Pielke Jr. , a political scientist and blogger at the University of Colorado , has written for several years about the air - capture idea ( and about why it has n’t gotten equal billing with options like biofuels ) .
Details on the Los Alamos approach will come next week when Dr. Martin gives a presentation at a government and industry meeting , Alternative Energy Now , in Lake Buena Vista , Fla .
The conference , held at a resort for military personnel , is sponsored mainly by the U.S. Air Force .
The Defense Department has been aggressively studying ways to provide secure sources of the vast amounts of fuel necessary to wage war even as oil dwindles and without the potential climate impact of turning coal into liquids .
My colleague Ken Chang , who has written on other concepts for capturing CO2 from the air , is checking this one out .
As described in a news release by Mr. Martin , it sounds like a possible candidate for Richard Branson ’s $ 25 million carbon - capturing prize :
“ Our concept enhances U.S. energy and material security by reducing dependence on imported oil .
Initial system and economic analyses indicate that the prices of Green Freedom commodities would be either comparable to the current market or competitive with those of other carbon - neutral , alternative technologies currently being considered . ”
The release added : “ The concept ’s viability has been reviewed and verified by both industrial and semi- independent Los Alamos National Laboratory technical reviews .
The next phase will demonstrate the new electrochemical process to prove the ability of the system to both capture carbon dioxide and pull it back out of solution .
An industrial partnership consortium will be formed to commercialize the Green Freedom concept . ”
Other researchers , at Columbia University , have conceived of similar systems that would use solar - thermal plants to drive the process .
There are many experts who doubt that nuclear plants — whether directly generating electricity or , in this case , making fuel — can play a significant role providing abundant energy in a carbon - constrained world , mainly because it takes so long to finance and build the structures .
There are several articles touching on the nuclear question in our ongoing Energy Challenge series .

Teenager , 15 , facing prosecution for holding a sign labelling Scientology 'a cult '
A 15 - year - old facing prosecution for holding up a placard which branded Scientology a " cult " has appealed for help to fight possible charges .
The unnamed teenager was served the summons by City of London police after taking part in a peaceful demonstration opposite the Church 's London headquarters , on May 10 .
Demonstrators from the anti-Scientology group , Anonymous were outside the church 's £ 23 m headquarters near St Paul 's cathedral when the boy was " strongly advised " by police to get rid of the sign which said : " Scientology is not a religion , it is a dangerous cult " .
A 15 - year - old boy is facing prosecution for holding a sign branding The Church of Scientology , a ' cult '
A policewoman later read him section five of the Public Order Act and " strongly advised " him to remove the sign .
The section prohibits signs which have representations or words which are threatening , abusive or insulting .
But the teenager refused , and a file is now being passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for possible legal action .
Writing on an anti-Scientology website , the teenager says : " I need precedents , legal advice , definitions and defences .
" I intend to make a big folder with all the defence you can give me , and in case this does get through to court , I will be well prepared .
" Also , what 's the likelihood I 'll need a lawyer ?
If I do have to get one , it 'll have to come out of my pocket money . "
Ian Haworth from the Cult Information Centre said he would avoid labelling any organisation a " cult " , but said bringing the issue into criminal rather than civil law would be " very serious " .
He added : " If it was n't so serious it would be farcical .
" I 'm very upset by what appears to have happened .
I hope the CPS realise that this is an error and that nothing happens to this young man . "
Liberty director , Shami Chakrabarti , told the Guardian : " This barmy prosecution makes a mockery of Britain 's free speech traditions .
" After criminalising the use of the word ' cult ' , perhaps the next step is to ban the words ' war ' and ' tax ' from peaceful demonstrations ? "
The teenager is seen in a video on YouTube quoting Mr Justice Latey as having said in a court judgment in 1984 that Scientology was a " cult " and was " corrupt , sinister and dangerous " .
However , a spokeswoman for City Police said they had received complaints about the use of the words " cult " and " scientology kills " and warned protestors their signs breached the Public Order Act .
Chief Supt Rob Bastable said : " City of London Police upholds the right to demonstrate lawfully .
" But we have to balance that with the right of all sections of community not to be alarmed , harassed or distressed as a result of other people 's behaviour . "
The force came under fire in 2006 for accepting thousands of pounds of hospitality from the Church of Scientology .
However a police spokeswoman said this was done in accordance with the force 's regulations .

What a terrible problem to have ...
Politico :
Yet it ’s had another consequence that has gone all but unnoticed .
The campaign finance reports filed by Obama and Clinton have grown so massive that they ’ve strained the capacity of the Federal Election Commission , good government groups , the media and even software applications to process and make sense of the data .
A milestone of sorts was reached earlier this year , when Obama , the Illinois senator whose revolutionary online fundraising has overwhelmed Clinton , filed an electronic fundraising report so large it could not be processed by popular basic spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel 2003 and Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 .
Those programs ca n’t download data files with more than 65,536 rows or 256 columns .
This is astounding on two levels .
For one , the huge influx of money to both campaigns is absolutely unheard of .
Can you even imagine how much cash the eventual nominee will have to throw around this fall once we combine forces ?
Couple that with McCain 's pathetic fundraising appeal , and we have a huge money advantage right off the bat , not to mention the luxury of running against the third term of the most unpopular President in US history .
Secondly , is the FEC so outdated that they 're really still using Excel 2003 ?
They can't be that incompetent , can they ?
Here 's the bad news :
Your little recession - deflecting tax rebate ?
No rebate at all .
Not even close .
It 's more like this :
You 've been continuously mugged and beaten and robbed blind for the past seven years straight , and as you lay there on the cold , hard economic ground , bleeding and gasping and wondering what the hell happened to your vacation time and your health care plan and your mortgage payment , your attackers scoff and leer and toss a couple of bloodstained nickels on your pulverized face and mutter , here sucker , have some bus fare , and then they cackle and stomp away with all your loot and dignity and hope , back to the White House from whence they came .
What , too harsh ?
Not really .
It 's a lovely feeling , made even more sweetly ironic by the fact that Congress will likely soon shove through another $ 108 billion in war funds like a giant kidney stone through our collective fiscal urethra .
Right there , that 's about 500 bucks for each and every adult human in America , baristas and Baptists and NASCAR fans alike .
Do you see ?
Your " economic stimulus " check is meaningless , an empty gesture , a trifling crumb of recompense after robbing you blind via insane gas prices , infrastructure meltdowns , massive failed wars that are n't really wars .
Thanks for the bogus check , Dubya , now where can I buy a sliver of our missing national dignity ?
Oh , that 's right .
So then .
Here are your bloody nickels , America .
Think of it as a " recession whippit , " because trust me , its quickie high wo n't last long .
What will you do with it ?
Pay off the porn bill ?
Hit the Vegas strip ?
Stock up on water and freeze - dried meats and a nice Bowie knife in preparation for the apocalypse ?
Not bad , not bad .
Of course , you could also spend it on :
One share of Google .
Hey , it 's the most powerful company on Earth .
It belches up bits of Microsoft after an organic tofu and wakame salad lunch in its massive world - class floating cafeteria in the sky .
Why not buy a tiny crumb of the company that already owns a large piece of you and everything you do and play with and think about and log into every single day ?
Sort of like buying back a tiny , digitized , bitmapped , rebranded , YouTubed , Street Viewed piece of your own exhausted soul .
Neat !
Four tanks of gas for the Escalade .
What , you 're still driving that giant Saudi - blessed beast ?
Still loving yourself some big clunky Range Rover ?
Good for you ( and good luck trying to trade it in ) .
But I 'm guessing even you few remaining SUV lovers out there feel a bit of a twinge now when the gas pump tips well over $ 100 to fill your massive tank as your tax refund merely flows straight back to Bush 's cronies in Big Oil in a giant feedback loop of joyful patriotic all - American pain .
A copy of Grand Theft Auto IV , three bottles of Stoli Vanilla , large hammer .
Mmm , the Great American Fantasy , playing the role of a macho Eastern European thug antihero who lives in the seedy underworld of Hellhole City , all broken glass and bad skin and silicone boob jobs and grunged - out everything , killing and stealing and blood splattering and fire , all part of a new and rather insane blockbuster game which employs an astonishing , hyperrealistic animation engine that makes the character 's movements so frighteningly lifelike , when you beat down that whore or shoot that cop in the face with an Uzi you can actually feel his facial bones pulverize as his body slams into the pavement and Death itself hovers just over your PS3 , eager to go multiplayer on your ass .
Gaming tips :
Slam two shots of vanilla Stoli between levels and strike self in head with hammer every time you murder a rival sociopathic thug , to acknowledge / symbolize the death of yet another hunk of any lingering compassion and / or love you may feel in this life .
Dude !
You 're never getting laid !
Cool !
his facial bones pulverize as his body slams into the pavement and Death itself hovers just over your PS3 , eager to go multiplayer on your ass .
IPod Touch , new Portishead album , bottle of absinthe .
Because nothing says modern American irony than listening to the most beautifully bleak and gorgeously despondent album of the year on the most sleek high - tech consumer gadget currently made , all while slowly lowering your brain cells down into the black cavelike dungeon of bittersweet anise - flavored bliss .
Or maybe that 's just me .
Three excellent meals at upscale sushi restaurant , attempting with each and every bite not to be painfully reminded of the depleted fish stocks and mercury poisoning and how just about every single game fish on the menu is overfished or horribly endangered or dying out or full of tiny little plastic pellets from the Pacific garbage patch .
Oh well .
At least the sake is still safe to drink , right ?
I mean , except for the potential global rice shortage ?
And the rioting ?

Reserve a small amount of money for 10 - pack of XXL wifebeater logo T - shirts from CollegeHumor.com and a Black Jesus bobblehead for your cubicle because you 're all , like , meta- ironic , and stuff .
Ten - day silent meditation course / retreat .
Do you love that recent study that essentially proves , yet again , what monks and gurus and yogis and wise ones have known for roughly 1 billion years ?
It 's this : Meditation can actually make you more compassionate , can induce states of empathy , can calm the turgid roil and boil of the Grand Theft Auto IV that is you and your badass 1998 Honda Civic and your cube - farm life .
It 's a breakthrough !
Or , you know , not .
Goes well with all the other studies from years past , proving how meditation boosts brain activity , helps focus attention , improves sleep , relieves stress , licks your heart , and helps you realize organized religion is absolutely silly and inane and dangerous because , hey look , close your eyes and breathe deeply and there 's the divine , right there , floating just on front of your third eye like a free bonus hooker from Level 9 of GTA - IV !
Awesome !

BRAND NEW BACKYARD PLAYGROUND !
Some people build swimming pools in their back yards .
But outdoor pools in Alaska just wo n't work .
Since this particular family lives on the outskirts of Anchorage , they decided to build a sturdy , colorful playground for their 3 and 4 year old sons , with smooth - stone gravel all around it to avoid knee scrapes and other injuries .
They finished building it on Saturday evening , and the following morning , as mom was about to wake up the boys and have them go out to play in their new play center , this is what she saw from the upstairs window :

But the trend towards more and more power is reversing to the point where experts have begun to speculate about a future " virtual console " model reminiscent of the " thin client computer " championed by Oracle last decade .
In the virtual console universe , the hardware would fade into the background to become little more than a hub while new releases of games , accessories , upgrades and other home entertainment and internet applications , would be delivered via software and firmware updates .
As compelling as this may sound for those who balk at forking out between $ 400 and $ 1000 for a new console , the concept of the entertainment hub is sharply at odds with the current reality .
IBM , a co-developer of the Cell chip used in Sony 's PlayStation3 , says consumers currently have more computing power plugged into their televisions via their gaming consoles than they have in the PCs sitting on their desks .
" Game processor power exceeded that of PC processors around the year 2000 .
What 's more , game processing power is increasing four times every three years , compared to two times every three years in PCs , " says John Cohn , a scientist at IBM .
Until now , the average life of a console has been about six years , which is about the time it takes the developers who often initially sell their hardware at a loss to realise a return on the their investment via an exclusive ecosystem of games , accessories and upgrades .
Jeff Brand , an associate professor in communication and media at Bond University , says the concept of a virtual console to replace the current generation of hardware is not beyond the realms of possibility .
" Already PlayStation 3 has gone from an expensive console to a more cut down machine to compete in the market .
Going beyond that to the next generation is really getting out the crystal ball but I can imagine that virtual consoles may be more common in seven years time .
They may work over a media PC in the home for which you have to buy software - which is the console - and then download games " .
Despite the obvious benefits to console manufacturers , who are under increasing pressure to reduce their prices , this model may cost them dearly in other ways .
Console revenues are sustained by a large and loyal following ; Xbox 360 has its hardcore gamers , Nintendo Wii's claims the casual crowd and the PS3 has planted a foot firmly in both camps .
Followers - or " fanboys " of each of the different platforms anticipate the release of popular games and peripherals with tremendous fervour .
Mr Brand warns that a shift from hardware to software could prove risky given the interest gaming devotees have for console form factor .
" What happens when these consoles switch over to software .
Will they [ the fans ] have the same love ? " he asks .
But as multiplayer gaming and social networking take on a more prominent role within the realm , many in the industry are starting to believe that the emphasis will shift beyond the box and into the actual games titles and networks that link them up with the outside world .
Steve Fawkner , CEO of Australian games developer , Infinite - Interactive , says the industry has reached a point where graphics are no longer the main factor in defining the quality of game content .
" I 've watched the number of people playing multiplayer products rise from two to three per cent of players in the early nineties up to phenomenal numbers today with games like World of Warcraft .
As the latest generation of players grow up within virtual communities , I think they will expect all future games to have some form of community built in . "
Mike Fegan , CEO of Australian game developer , Transimission does n't anticipate another round of major console upgrades any time in the near future .
" Both the PS3 and Xbox 360 have got the networking side of the platform that allows you to interact in the world wide web community and most upgrades can now be done through software . "
Sony is taking a similarly long term view for the PS3 .
" We think a ten year life cycle for PS3 is totally realistic , " says Michael Ephraim , the managing director of Sony Australia .
" With all this firmware upgradability .
. . its almost limitless . "
He says customers can already upgrade to the version 1.2 of Blu-ray via firmware and will soon be able to add entirely new applications designed to keep the device relevant through its online virtual community , Home .
The company is repositioning the existing PS3 console as a multimedia gaming hub for the lounge room , packaging in new features like an electronic program guide called PlayTV alongside its Blu-ray player .
And for those who want to continue gaming outside of the lounge room , traditional console game titles are also being repurposed for handheld devices and mobile phones allowing real enthusiasts continue playing popular games such as World of Warcraft as they take the bus to work .
" Mobile devices like the iPhone with their multi - touch capabilities , are likely to begin to make an impact sometime during this cycle now that they are coming more inline with the specifications of something that we can truly enjoy games on , " says Mr Fawkner .
Mr Fegan agrees .
" I think the big sleeping giant is still Nokia on the mobile front and obviously with three billion plus mobiles out there , it will be a player .
It is already working on a joint venture with an Indian company that is doing the traditional console game and they are doing the mobile version so when you walk out of the door you can play a mini version of the game .
The other platform to watch is the iPhone , " he says .
What we think of as a game today may have very little resemblance to tomorrow 's landscape which experts agree is likely to be a far more immersive and three - dimensional .
The future of gaming to me is a piece of hardware embedded in a TV allowing you to be part of a huge community , says Mr Fegan .
" The processing power of the current platforms , high definition TVs and the storage capacity of Blu-ray will also allow developers like us to do far more immersive 3D environments for games . "
According to Mr Fawkner , peripherals will also play a big part in this future .
" I think the key to creating the next generation of successful consoles is more about innovating the way a player interacts with the game .
New peripherals such as the Rock Band controllers , and new types of experience such as Nintendogs , are where the smart console - makers will be focusing " .
WOULD the Labour Party really consider foisting a second unelected prime minister on Britain ?
Apparently so .
Less than a year after Gordon Brown succeeded Tony Blair , the idea of installing a third front man has become thinkable for some of his erstwhile supporters .
That it has come to this reflects the astonishing speed of Mr Brown 's fall .
Last summer , when the prime minister handled a series of minor crises reasonably competently , he seemed able to turn floodwaters into wine .
His long , scheming wait for the top job appeared to have been triumphantly vindicated .
Yet in the local elections on May 1st , Labour recorded its worst result in living memory , including the loss of London 's mayoralty to the Conservatives .
Mr Brown 's personal rating has plunged even more violently .
His apotheosis , it now seems , has led only to agony .
As a result , some Labour MPs are conducting a campaign against him that is likely to damage not only their leader but also their party 's chances of re-election .
The fall
It is n't all his fault .
Mr Brown is in part the victim of one of the basic laws of politics : gravity .
Assuming the premiership after Mr Blair 's decade in office , he also inherited an electorate that had grown bored and increasingly hostile to Labour .
He was bequeathed a messy party - funding scandal and a Tory opposition under new and ( finally ) competent management : David Cameron has stolen many of New Labour 's ideas ( see article ) .
Nor is it Mr Brown 's fault that his succession was followed by a dip in the impressively consistent economic growth over which , as chancellor , he presided , and by biting rises in the price of energy and food over which he has little control .
But Mr Brown is responsible for most of what has gone wrong for him .
The collapse of Northern Rock is symptomatic of his basic problem : that Labour has been in power long enough for its mistakes to catch up with it .
As chancellor , he introduced a badly designed regulation system , with the result that nobody was really in charge of overseeing the banks when the credit crunch hit .
He frittered away cash , with the result that the government is going into an economic downturn short of it .
He undermined Mr Blair 's public - service reforms , with the result that the government has failed to deliver improvements in education and the health service sharp enough to meet voters ' rising expectations .
He meddled continually with business , with the result that the private sector is howling about red tape .
He fiddled with the tax system , including abolishing a tax band designed to help poor people — a change that has ignited a row in his party that he is battling to defuse .
Mr Brown 's character does not help .
His new job requires a set of traits — ruthlessness , boldness , a malleable charisma , decisiveness — that might not be attractive in a friend but are necessary in a leader .
His leadership defects were especially exposed during the hinge of his premiership thus far : the weeks last autumn when he considered holding a general election .
The game - playing exposed Mr Brown 's efforts to appear ecumenical — the great Tory - hater taking tea with Lady Thatcher , for instance — as so much cynical manipulation .
Worst of all was his behaviour after he pulled back .
He first comically denied that opinion polls had affected his decision , then over - hastily emulated a crowd - pleasing Tory tax proposal , leaving an enduring impression of intellectual surrender .
That sorry episode unleashed another near - unstoppable political force : momentum .
All political news is now interpreted through the refractive lens of Mr Brown 's failings .
His few good ideas go unrecognised ; unrelated mishaps congeal into a narrative of defeat .
The Tories , meanwhile , are soaring in the opposite direction .
Their momentum is scaring Labour MPs , who made Mr Brown their leader without demur , into distancing themselves from him or embracing outright defeatism — a panicked fickleness that serves only to dig their collective hole deeper .
Can Mr Brown reverse the dynamics ?
He has been offered no shortage of advice from his party .
Turn left , say those who never much cared for the New in New Labour , and in his weakness see a chance to ditch it .
Smile more , say others — though when Mr Brown tries to speak human he seems less convincing than when he sticks to macroeconomics .
There are a few who , despite the risk of looking chaotically undemocratic , simply enjoin him to go : over half the Labour supporters in a Populus poll for the Times want him out .
Mr Brown can scarcely complain about disloyalty , for he helped to inculcate a taste for plots and mutinies during his long march to Downing Street .
But would his removal improve things ?
From the Labour Party 's point of view , there are too many flimsy contenders to replace him and scarcely any serious ones .
The struggle to get rid of a leader causes lasting damage — as the Tories , who only recently recovered from the civil war unleashed by the ouster of Lady Thatcher , know well .
Besides , the Tories need a huge swing to form a government at the next election , probably in 2010 .
They are still planning for a hung parliament .
Scandal , or an eruption of atavistic , Conservatism may yet weaken Mr Cameron .
The new mayor of London , Boris Johnson , now an icon of Tory resurgence , may embarrass his party ( see article ) .
Too early for an execution
From the country 's viewpoint , it is even harder to see why Mr Brown needs the coup de grâce just yet .
Britain is not being overtly misgoverned , and nobody else in Labour is promising anything radically different .
And Mr Brown may yet improve .
To do so , he needs to articulate his basic political creed — essentially a meritocracy leavened with egalitarianism — better than he has managed to do so far .
And , from this newspaper 's point of view , he needs to commit unequivocally to the course of public - service reform eventually set by Mr Blair , then pursue it with dogged competence .
If he does this , especially if the economy recovers , he will have a chance against the Tories .
Otherwise , he will go down in history as the worst sort of political failure : the sort who schemes to get a job and then has no idea what to do with it .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad accused the United States and its allies of plotting to assassinate him during a visit to neighboring Iraq in March , state radio reported on Friday .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad speaks at the opening ceremony of the 29th Annual Session of the OPEC Ministerial Council in Isfahan 450 km ( 280 miles ) south of Tehran June 17 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Morteza Nikoubazl
“ Based on reliable intelligence , our enemies had plans to kidnap and kill your servant ( Ahmadinejad ) .
But we intentionally made last minute changes in our schedule , ” the radio quoted Ahmadinejad telling a meeting of clerics in the Shi’ite holy city of Qom on Thursday .
Although he did not identify the United States by name , he used the usual term “ enemies ” to refer to Washington .
A senior U.S. military official in Baghdad said : “ The Coalition is unaware of any threats to President Ahmadinejad ’s life during his
visit to Iraq . ”
During the first visit by an Iranian leader to Iraq since the neighbors fought an eight - year war in the 1980s , Ahmadinejad cancelled his scheduled visit to Shi’ite holy cities of Karbala and Najaf in southern Iraq .
The presidential office said at the time the trip was cancelled for security reasons .
“ The enemies learned about the changes when we already had left Iraq .
They were shocked , ” the radio quoted him as saying .
The United States accuses Iran of funding , arming and training Shi’ite militias in Iraq .
Iran denies the charge .
Ahmadinejad , who often berates Washington in fiery speeches , used his visit to Baghdad to call on the United States to withdraw its troops from Iraq , insisting their presence is to blame for the country ’s sectarian violence .
Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the revolution when the U.S. embassy was seized by hardline students and 52 Americans were taken hostages for 444 days .
Ahmadinejad said his warm reception by Shi’ite and Kurdish leaders were in stark contrast to the rushed and secretive visits of U.S. President George W. Bush .
“ I was the first head of government who made previous announcements about my trip to Iraq , ” he was quoted as saying .
“ British and American leaders had stayed only a few hours in Iraq and had not stayed there for two days , like I did . ”
Both Iran and Iraq are run by Shi’ite majorities and many of Iraq ’s Shi’ite leaders were in exile in Iran during Saddam Hussein ’s rule .
The countries also have historical economic , political and cultural links .
Tehran and Washington are also at odds over Iran ’s nuclear program , which Washington says is a cover to build nuclear weapons .
Tehran denies the charge , saying it needs nuclear power to generate electricity .

PLUS : Texas AG Settles Suit by Elderly African American Voters Harassed During State's ' Voter Fraud ' Investigation
Brad Friedman Byon 5/28/2008 , 4:20 pm PT
What 's a Grand Ol ' Party to do when they wish to disenfranchise Democratic voters via the specious specter of " voter fraud " when they can't actually find any evidence to make their case ?
Why , call their media wing at Fox " News " of course !
Fox picks up today where the DoJ and Republican Party have had no luck so far , but not for lack of trying .
Hey , if you can't beat 'em , publicize 'em , and make it sound like you 're beating 'em , at least .
David Edwards and Muriel Kane report at RAW STORY today that Fox is running a " special investigation " into non-citizens throwing elections :
" Could illegal immigrants sway an election ? '
Eric Shawn of Fox News asked on Wednesday , raising the terrifying specter of " people who are not even citizens voting for whomever they want . "
Since 2005 , the Bush administration has been pushing the idea that " voter fraud " is a widespread problem , even firing US Attorneys who did not make the investigation of claims of fraud a priority .
However , investigations have never found more than a handful of votes being cast illegally , while requiring proof of citizenship seems likely to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters , mostly the poor and elderly who may not be able to secure required documentation .
Fox News has now set out to find the evidence of fraud that the Bush Department of Justice could not , whipping up their audience with the threat of non-citizens " getting a fake ID , a driver 's license , or a social security card and voting in this year 's election . "
" If you think there 's voter fraud where you live , or there are other election problems , we at Fox News want to know about it , " Shawn told viewers .
" You can email us .
... voterfraud@foxnews.com . "
RAW has the amusing video from this morning as well .
Well , you heard 'em , kids .
Fox is looking for voter fraud !
Feel free to email them this link : https://bradblog.com/CoulterFraud documenting the no-uncertain - terms case of Ann Coulter having committed voter fraud in Palm Beach County , Florida !
Fox would love to hear from you at : voterfraud@foxnews.com .
Feel free to let 'em know I sent you , in case they have any further questions .
I 'll be happy to speak to them , and help 'em root out those voter fraud criminals !
BTW , Fox & Friends , at least , already knows about Coulter 's voter fraud , since they called me last year to ask me to appear on their morning show to talk about it after Liz Smith ran an item on the matter in Murdoch 's NY Post pointing to BRAD BLOG 's coverage ...
The appearance was scuttled , however , when , for some reason , Ms. Coulter was just unable to clear her schedule to make it there to appear along with me .
What a surprise , eh ?
Of course , Fox finally chose not to run anything at all on the matter , despite the miles of documentation proving that Ann Coulter , absolutely , committed voter fraud in Palm Beach County .
RELATED : The meager handful of cases of voter fraud that Texas ' Attorney General Greg Abbott was able to find --- after coming to office two years ago promising to " stamp out " the " epidemic of voter fraud in Texas " and spending the $ 1.4 million federal tax - payer grant he was able to get --- have caused the AG far more trouble than they were worth .
As of today , his office has settled with Democrats who had filed suit against the AG for tactics they charged amounted to intimidating and / or harassing voters , including state officers peeking into the shower window of an elderly African American woman who has since suffered a stroke .
Lone Star Project has background and the bullet point settlement terms ; lawyers from the State of Texas sought such terms to avoid trial , which had been set to begin today .
Aman Batheja at Fort Worth Star - Telegram has more details , including the AG office 's claim that it was they , not the plaintiffs , who " won " in this settlement with the little old lady masterminds of voter fraud .
If you do n't know Jesus , the One we are praying to for a cure , then please take a minute to read this .
If you 've already been looking over pages of this site and others , this one is truly worth your time .
This one could change your life forever .
A team of notorious American internet spammers has been fined a record $ 230 m for bombarding MySpace users with adverts for pornography and gambling websites .
" Spam king " Sanford Wallace , along with his business partner Walter Rines , were yesterday ordered to pay unprecedented damages to the social networking website – amounting to the strongest punishment ever handed out to a spammer in the US .
A court in Los Angeles heard how Wallace and Rines sent more than 700,000 messages to MySpace users , fooling them into visiting gambling sites or adult - rated pages .
Disguised as comments from the user 's friends , the notes in fact contained advertisements that made the pair a small fee every time somebody was fooled into clicking on them .
Although evidence suggested that the pair made around $ 500,000 from their activities , district judge Audrey Collins used the terms of America 's CAN - SPAM
Act – which can levy up to $ 300 for each infringement of the law .
Wallace has long been one of the world 's most high - profile junk marketers , earning the nickname " Spamford " for his recurring trouble with the law .
In the early 1990s he progressed from circulating fax messages to sending internet spam – and rose to prominence as the head of infamous Philadelphia - based spam giant Cyber Promotions .
The duo , who failed to turn up at court for the judgment , were also banned from similar activities in the future – though experts said it may not deter them .
" These two spammers are just the tip of an iceberg , " said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant for internet security company Sophos .
" Even if MySpace were to extricate the fine from these two men – which seems unlikely given their past record – there will be plenty more cybercriminals trying to make money from junk email . "
The $ 230 m fine is many times greater than previous records for such activities , and is almost half of the $ 580 m paid by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation for MySpace itself in 2005 .
Hemanshu Nigam , the website 's chief security officer , said the company would continue suing spammers who abused its systems .
" MySpace has zero tolerance for those who attempt to act illegally on our site , " Nigam said .
" We remain committed to punishing those who violate the law and try to harm our members . "

“ I ’m just going to do everything in 3D now .
I ’m going to shoot my daughter ’s birthday party in 3D . ” – James Cameron .
A revolution in photography and videography is coming .
The 50’s cliche of the 3D movie and nostalgic childhood 3D viewers like the Viewmaster were ideas ahead of their time .
Pretty soon 3D will be everywhere .
Thousands of US cinemas are being upgraded to show new 3D movies , new computer display technology is bringing 3D without glasses to the desktop , and a growing enthusiastic community is breathing new life into time - honored 3D photography techniques .
If you have n’t experimented with 3D photography yet , now ’s the time .
Anyone with a camera can take 3D photos , and with a bit of practice , most people can learn to see the 3D effect on their monitors without special glasses .
I ’ve collected here a few examples of some of the cool stuff that photographers are doing with 3D photography today .
I hope these images will entertain and inspire you to explore the third dimension in your photography , and put you ahead of the new wave of 3D imagery which will soon flood our culture .
All of the images below are presented in “ crossed eye ” format , and can be viewed by most people without any equipment or assistance .
To learn how to see crosseye 3D images , I have a step by step guide for you to read .
WARNING : It ’s important to state right up front , that there is a small potential risk to your health with this 3D viewing technique .
The risk is very small , but I must cover myself .
If you have any known problems with your eye muscles , I recommend that you do not attempt this technique .
If you experience any light - headedness , headaches or other symptoms , STOP IMMEDIATELY and rest your eyes .
Everyone will likely experience some slight eye fatigue when learning this technique , so it is very important to rest your eyes regularly , and only look at 3D images for short periods of time .
Even once you have perfected the technique , do not over - exert your eyes .
You have been warned .
If you attempt to learn this technique , you agree not to hold me responsible for any ill fortune that befalls you as a result .
UPDATE : here ’s a few more

Pretty cool is n’t it ?
As you can see from these outstanding examples , 3D photography is very versatile and has huge creative possibilities .
The best part is that you do n’t need special or expensive equipment to make 3D photos .
I wrote a post on my blog that shows how you can make 3D photos with any camera and free software .
I highly encourage all photographers to give it a try , and get involved with the active and creative 3D communities online .
Right now , I ’m running a 3D photography project on my blog , called 3D For Everyone .
Using the simple single - camera 3D photography skills , I want participants to take a cool 3D photo and submit it to the project .
Thanks to my sponsor for the project , Loreo – makers of the 3D Lens in a Cap – every participant will receive for free a new Pixi 3D viewer for seeing 3D photos on your monitor without using special eye tricks .
The overall winner , as selected by a panel of judges , will be given their own 3D Lens in a Cap .
The due date for the project is the 26th of May , so hurry and visit the project page .
3D Photography is back , and this time around everyone can get involved , so do n’t get left behind !

Every adult in America probably remembers 9/11 in the immediate sense - the first time hearing the news , seeing the images , the confusion , uncertainty and fear of that day - but it seems like our memory of the period immediately after is hazy .
For a month or two we were traumatized as a nation and had trouble understanding what had happened , and what should come next .
By the end of 2001 the drumbeat for war had begun and it is possible that fixing our attention on how best to attack Iraq served as a psychological crutch by giving us something to focus on .
This is not a professional opinion , just an observation based on what I went through and saw others going through .
( And it is emphatically not an attempt to rationalize the Iraq war . )
One extremely unfortunate byproduct of that period is the USA PATRIOT Act ( UPA ) ; two recent events are the latest examples why .
The UPA floor debate in the House gives a good reminder of what the original intent was .
James Sensenbrenner broadly described it as " landmark legislation [ which ] will provide law enforcement and intelligence agencies additional tools that are needed to address the threat of terrorism and to find and prosecute terrorist criminals . "
Michael Oxley chimed in with this :
I rise in support of the legislation , particularly the provisions in title III which would represent the most comprehensive anti-money laundering legislation which the House has considered in more than a decade .
The legislation gives the administration important new tools with which to wage a global financial war on terrorism , and to starve Osama bin Laden and others like him of the funding needed to commit their acts of evil .... With this legislation , we take a critical step toward smoking terrorists and other criminal organizations out of the offshore financial bunkers that for too long have offered them safe haven .
Look at the stated targets : Terrorist criminals , terrorists and other criminal organizations , Osama bin Laden and others like him .
Even well afterward Orrin Hatch declared " Congress enacted the USA Patriot Act , in part ... to increase consultation and coordination efforts between intelligence and federal law enforcement officers to investigate and protect against foreign terrorist threats . "
Who could possibly object ?
Robert Scott of Virginia , for one : " First of all , this has limited to do with terrorism .
This bill is general search warrant and wiretap law .
It is not just limited to terrorism .
Had it been limited to terrorism , this bill could have passed 3 or 4 weeks ago without much discussion , but we are talking about wiretapping law . "
But we were n't pausing to consider such esoteric concerns then .
Subsequent events have shown why Rep. Scott was precisely right .
Eliot Spitzer was caught because of the suspicious activity reporting rule in the UPA that was aimed at money laundering and terrorist financing .
Then there is the Briana Waters case .
Waters is accused of " domestic terrorism " , a new category of crime created by the UPA .
She was recently convicted of participating in arson at the Center of Urban Horticulture on the University of Washington campus .
The building was torched in the middle of the night and sustained $ 2.5 million in damage .
Please be very clear on the following :
My concern here is not with the details of either case nor the guilt or innocence of the accused .
All I want to point out is the fact that provisions of the UPA are already being used outside of their initial scope .
When Congress was all too briefly ( via ) considering this bill we were told over and over it was all about the Osama bin Ladens of the world .
We were assured the government would use its new powers with restraint in solemn acknowledgement of the gravity of the threat .
That simply was pure bunk .
The abuses began almost immediately ( via ) and have continued to the present .
There is no reason to expect it to stop .
Authorities test the limits of new powers for the same reason a three year old tests the limits of parents ' patience :
To see how much they can get away with .
When the new powers are accompanied by minimal oversight or a cowed and timid populace the abuses will be much more frequent and severe .
These latest abuses of government power give us reason to step back and reflect on what we are doing to ourselves , and it certainly should be at the front of our minds now that Mike McConnell and Michael Mukasey are telling ( via ) us over and over how desperately they need ( via ) additional new powers to fight the terrorists .
NEW DELHI : China���s cyber warfare army is marching on , and India is suffering silently .
Over the past one and a half years , officials said , China has mounted almost daily attacks on Indian computer networks , both government and private , showing its intent and capability .
( Watch : �� �China 's cyber intrusion a threat��� )
The sustained assault almost coincides with the history of the present political disquiet between the two countries .
According to senior government officials , these attacks are not isolated incidents of something so generic or basic as " hacking " ��� they are far more sophisticated and complete ��� and there is a method behind the madness .
Publicly , senior government officials , when questioned , take refuge under the argument that " hacking " is a routine activity and happens from many areas around the world .
But privately , they acknowledge that the cyber warfare threat from China is more real than from other countries .
The core of the assault is that the Chinese are constantly scanning and mapping India���s official networks .
This gives them a very good idea of not only the content but also of how to disable the networks or distract them during a conflict .
This , officials say , is China���s way of gaining " an asymmetrical advantage " over a potential adversary .
The big attacks that were sourced to China over the last few months included an attack on NIC ( National Infomatics Centre ) , which was aimed at the National Security Council , and on the MEA .
Other government networks , said sources , are routinely targeted though they haven���t been disabled .
A quiet effort is under way to set up defence mechanisms , but cyber warfare is yet to become a big component of India���s security doctrine .
Dedicated teams of officials ��� all underpaid , of course ��� are involved in a daily deflection of attacks .
But the real gap is that a retaliatory offensive system is yet to be created .
And it���s not difficult , said sources .
Chinese networks are very porous ��� and India is an acknowledged IT giant !
There are three main weapons in use against Indian networks ��� BOTS , key loggers and mapping of networks .
According to sources in the government , Chinese hackers are acknowledged experts in setting up BOTS .
A BOT is a parasite program embedded in a network , which hijacks the network and makes other computers act according to its wishes , which , in turn , are controlled by " external " forces .
The controlled computers are known as " zombies " in the colourful language of cyber security , and are a key aspect in cyber warfare .
According to official sources , there are close to 50,000 BOTS in India at present ��� and these are " operational " figures .
What is the danger ?
Simply put , the danger is that at the appointed time , these " external " controllers of BOTNETS will command the networks , through the zombies , to move them at will .
Exactly a year ago , Indian computer security experts got a glimpse of what could happen when a targeted attack against Estonia shut that country down ��� it was done by one million computers from different parts of the world ��� and many of them were from India !
That , officials said , was executed by cyber terrorists from Russia , who are deemed to be more deadlier .
The point that officials are making is that there are internal networks in India that are controlled from outside ��� a sort of cyberspace fifth column .
Hence , the need for a more aggressive strategy .
Key loggers is software that scans computers and their processes and data the moment you hit a key on the keyboard .
This information is immediately carried over to an external controller ��� so they know even when you change your password .
Mapping or scanning networks is done as a prerequisite to modern cyber warfare tactics .
MEA has a three - layered system of computer and network usage ��� only the most open communication is sent on something called " e- grams " .
The more classified stuff uses old - economy methods ��� ironically , probably the most secure though a lot more time - consuming .
The same is true of other critical areas of the government .
But the real gap inside the national security establishment is one of understanding the true nature of the threat .
National security adviser M K Narayanan set up the National Technology Research Organization , which is also involved in assessing cyber security threats .
But the cyber security forum of the National Security Council has become defunct after the US spy incident .
This has scarred the Indian establishment so badly that it���s now frozen in its indecision .
This has seriously hampered India���s decision - making process in cyber warfare .
If this is dissonance , it is at least dissonance that the modern Orthodox should be able to understand : the desire to inhabit multiple worlds simultaneously and to defy contradiction with coexistence .
After all , the school ’s attempt to bring the ideals of Orthodox Judaism into dialogue with a certain slice of late - 20th - century American life was in many ways fantastically rich and productive .
For those of us willing to accept a bit of both worlds , I would say , it almost worked .
Fitting In
Since the birth of modern Orthodox Judaism in 19th - century Germany , a central goal of the movement has been to normalize the observance of traditional Jewish law — to make it possible to follow all 613 biblical commandments assiduously while still participating in the reality of the modern world .
You must strive to be , as a poet of the time put it , “ a Jew in the home and a man in the street . ”
Even as we students of the Maimonides School spent half of every school day immersed in what was unabashedly a medieval curriculum , our aim was to seem to outsiders — and to ourselves — like reasonable , mainstream people , not fanatics or cult members .
This ambition is best exemplified today by Senator Joe Lieberman .
His run for the vice presidency in 2000 put the “ modern ” in modern Orthodox , demonstrating that an Orthodox Jewish candidate could be accepted by America at large as essentially a regular guy .
( Some of this , of course , was simply the result of ignorance .
As John Breaux , then a senator from Louisiana , so memorably put it with regard to Lieberman during the 2000 campaign , “ I do n’t think American voters care where a man goes to church on Sunday . ” )
Whatever concerns Lieberman ’s Jewish identity may have raised in the heartland seem to have been moderated , rather than stoked , by the fact that his chosen Jewish denomination was Orthodox — that he seemed to really and truly believe in something .
His Orthodoxy elicited none of the half - whispered attacks that Mitt Romney ’s Mormonism has already prompted in this electoral cycle , none of the dark hints that it was , in some basic sense , weird .
Lieberman ’s overt normalcy really is remarkable .
Though modern Orthodox Jews do not typically wear the long beards , side curls and black , nostalgic Old World garments favored by the ultra-Orthodox , the men do wear beneath their clothes a small fringed prayer shawl every bit as outré as the sacred undergarments worn by Mormons .
Morning prayers are accompanied by the daily donning of phylacteries , which , though painless , resemble in their leather - strappy way the cinched cilice worn by the initiates of Opus Dei and so lasciviously depicted in “ The Da Vinci Code . ”
Food restrictions are tight : a committed modern Orthodox observer would not drink wine with non-Jews and would have trouble finding anything to eat in a nonkosher restaurant other than undressed cold greens ( assuming , of course , that the salad was prepared with a kosher knife ) .
The dietary laws of kashrut are designed to differentiate and distance the observant person from the rest of the world .
When followed precisely , as I learned growing up , they accomplish exactly that .
Every bite requires categorization into permitted and prohibited , milk or meat .
To follow these laws , to analyze each ingredient in each food that comes into your purview , is to construct the world in terms of the rules borne by those who keep kosher .
The category of the unkosher comes unconsciously to apply not only to foods that fall outside the rules but also to the people who eat that food — which is to say , almost everyone in the world , whether Jewish or not .
You cannot easily break bread with them , but that is not all .
You cannot , in a deeper sense , participate with them in the common human activity of restoring the body through food .
And yet the Maimonides School , by juxtaposing traditional and secular curricula , gave me a feeling of being connected to the broader world .
Line by line we burrowed into the old texts in their original Hebrew and Aramaic .
The poetry of the Prophets sang in our ears .
After years of this , I found I could recite the better part of the Hebrew Bible from memory .
Among other things , this meant that when I encountered the writings of the Puritans who founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony , I felt immediate kinship .
They read those same exact texts again and again — often in Hebrew — searching for clues about their own errand into the American wilderness .
In our literature classes we would glimpse Homer ’s wine - dark sea , then move to a different classroom and dive headlong into the sea of the Talmud .
Here the pleasure of legal - intellectual argument had no stopping place , no end .
A problem in Talmud study is never answered , it is only deepened .
The Bible prohibits work on the Sabbath .
But what is work ?
The rabbis began with 39 categories , each of which called for its own classification into as many as 39 further subcategories .
Then came the problem of intention :
What state of mind is required for “ work ” to have occurred ?
You might perform an act of work absent - mindedly , having forgotten that it was the Sabbath , or ignorantly , not knowing that action constituted work .
You might perform an action with the goal of achieving some permissible outcome — but that result might inevitably entail some prohibited work ’s taking place .
Learning this sort of reasoning as a child prepared me well , as it has countless others , for the ways of American law .

5 Battlefield : Bad Company Sells Upgrades For Real - World Money
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The Battlefield games have , for several years now , been known for the massive scale and depth of their multiplayer action .
In non-nerdspeak :
There are lots of people online , that have to use teamwork to get anything done .
Oh , one minor thing .
There 's a regular version of the game , and a " gold " version that is n't made of gold , but does have some extra guns available .
So what 's the problem ?
It should n't come as a surprise that people start to get angry when you can pay actual money to make yourself more powerful than your penniless opponents .
Suddenly , our online fantasy world starts to look a whole lot like the real one .

But , hey , that 's capitalism , right ?
And after all , on the regular version if you reach the highest level the new guns open up anyway .
You pay more for the ridiculous box
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Wait a second ... that means the guns you have to pay extra for are already on the disk .
In other words , you paid for everything available in the game when you first bought it .
You just are n't allowed to use everything you paid for unless you shell out even more money .
Think about that for just one minute and see if your mind does n't implode .
Buying something .
That you paid for .
And own .
That youcan hold in your hand .
And yes , early testers say that people who pay to unlock these guns will supposedly have a very distinct advantage over the people who use the default guns .
To call this an ominous development is a huge understatement .
EA has said this is a marketing experiment that they will continue , should they find it profitable .
Fans are n't happy :
Real - life Equivalent :
Buying a car that comes with air conditioning , then finding out you have to pay extra to have it activated .
When contemplating the world 's environmental problems , it 's sometimes hard not to feel like humanity is screwed .
But then you attend an event like Future Cities , a panel of sustainability experts held last night at the World Science Festival , and it seems like we might just figure out how to thrive on this planet after all .
First up was Peter Head , director of sustainable urban engineering firm Arup .
He talked about a model city now under construction in Dongtan , China .
When finished , it will be the world 's first sustainable city : an eco-paradise of open space , mixed neighborhoods and convenient transportation .
Head said that the Chinese government has commissioned nine cities altogether .
" China decided it had to change , " he said .
To which I was equally optimistic and skeptical :
It 's wonderful to think that China 's government realizes the importance of sustainability , but when they pay your bills , it would n't make sense to say otherwise .
But Head later added , " Investment banks take experimental green cities seriously as an investment .
They did n't one year ago . "
( See Wired 's profile of the city at Dongtan here . )
Next came microbiologist - turned - agro - revolutionary Dickson Despommier , intellectual godfather of vertical farming : skyscrapers full of gardens that produce our food and free farmland to return to CO2 - sequestering forests .
It 's a no - brainer solution for a global population that will be 80 percent urban by 2050 and is in desperate need of a climate change fix : Read my interview with Despommier here
Following Despommier was Majora Carter , the South Bronx born - and - raised environmentalist and MacArthur genius grant winner .
She talked of the disproportionate pollution burden borne by the poor – a burden that is both physically and mentally damaging , exacerbating a cycle of poverty , crime and frustration .
Carter believes that green - collar jobs can break this cycle : she founded SmartRoofs , a green roofing company , and her nonprofit Sustainable South Bronx offers green - collar job training .
Columbia University architecture professor and former MIT Media Lab Smart Cities wonk Mitchell Joachim spoke next .
I 'm not sure exactly what I think about his talk .
Pieces of it – such as the City Car he helped design – were inspiring .
Other parts , such as the Peristaltic City , seemed less about genuine sustainability than gee - whiz brainstorming given a green veneer .
Then again , gee - whiz brainstorming is an important part of the creative process , and helps colonize territories of the imagination that can later be developed more practically .
( And I really , really want to live in a Tree Hab someday . )
But stuff like the Ecotarium
\– a cute video of major cities disembarking from land and setting sail for the North Pole – felt frivolous on the same stage with the real - world struggles of Despommier and Carter and Head .
Finally there was green materials guru Blaine Brownell ( pictured above ) , who gave a Willy Wonka - esque demostration of sustainable building products : spherical solar cells , flexible solar cells , zero - energy wallboard , luminescent gravel , kinetic glass , self - healing plastic , structural textiles , air - scrubbing paint and self - cleaning glass .
In short , a whole lot of green ingenuity was on display – and this is just the beginning .
Just think how the field will blow up when , as
Peter Head hinted , it gets seriously profitable .

When I try to introduce the subject of advanced AI , what ’s the first thing I hear , more than half the time ?
“ Oh , you mean like the Terminator movies / The Matrix / Asimov ’s robots ! ”
And I reply , “ Well , no , not exactly .
I try to avoid the logical fallacy of generalizing from fictional evidence . ”
Some people get it right away , and laugh .
Others defend their use of the example , disagreeing that it ’s a fallacy .
What ’s wrong with using movies or novels as starting points for the discussion ?
No one ’s claiming that it ’s true , after all .
Where is the lie , where is the rationalist sin ?
Science fiction represents the author ’s attempt to visualize the future ; why not take advantage of the thinking that ’s already been done on our behalf , instead of starting over ?
Not every misstep in the precise dance of rationality consists of outright belief in a falsehood ; there are subtler ways to go wrong .
First , let us dispose of the notion that science fiction represents a full - fledged rational attempt to forecast the future .
Even the most diligent science fiction writers are , first and foremost , storytellers ; the requirements of storytelling are not the same as the requirements of forecasting .
As Nick Bostrom points out :
1
When was the last time you saw a movie about humankind suddenly going extinct ( without warning and without being replaced by some other civilization ) ?
While this scenario may be much more probable than a scenario in which human heroes successfully repel an invasion of monsters or robot warriors , it would n’t be much fun to watch .
So there are specific distortions in fiction .
2
But trying to correct for these specific distortions is not enough .
A story is never a rational attempt at analysis , not even with the most diligent science fiction writers , because stories do n’t use probability distributions .
I illustrate as follows :
Bob Merkelthud slid cautiously through the door of the alien spacecraft , glancing right and then left ( or left and then right ) to see whether any of the dreaded Space Monsters yet remained .
At his side was the only weapon that had been found effective against the Space Monsters , a Space Sword forged of pure titanium with 30 % probability , an ordinary iron crowbar with 20 % probability , and a shimmering black discus found in the smoking ruins of Stonehenge with 45 % probability , the remaining 5 % being distributed over too many minor outcomes to list here .
Merklethud ( though there ’s a significant chance that Susan Wifflefoofer was there instead ) took two steps forward or one step back , when a vast roar split the silence of the black airlock !
Or the quiet background hum of the white airlock !
Although Amfer and Woofi ( 1997 ) argue that Merklethud is devoured at this point , Spacklebackle ( 2003 ) points out that —
Characters can be ignorant , but the author ca n’t say the three magic words “ I do n’t know . ”
The protagonist must thread a single line through the future , full of the details that lend flesh to the story , from Wifflefoofer ’s appropriately futuristic attitudes toward feminism , down to the color of her earrings .
Then all these burdensome details and questionable assumptions are wrapped up and given a short label , creating the illusion that they are a single package .

On problems with large answer spaces , the greatest difficulty is not verifying the correct answer but simply locating it in answer space to begin with .
If someone starts out by asking whether or not AIs are gonna put us into capsules like in The Matrix , they ’re jumping to a 100 - bit proposition , without a corresponding 98 bits of evidence to locate it in the answer space as a possibility worthy of explicit consideration .
It would only take a handful more evidence after the first 98 bits to promote that possibility to near - certainty , which tells you something about where nearly all the work gets done .
The “ preliminary ” step of locating possibilities worthy of explicit consideration includes steps like : weighing what you know and do n’t know , what you can and ca n’t predict ; making a deliberate effort to avoid absurdity bias and widen confidence intervals ; pondering which questions are the important ones , trying to adjust for possible Black Swans and think of ( formerly ) unknown unknowns .
Jumping to “ The Matrix : Yes or No ? ” skips over all of this .
Any professional negotiator knows that to control the terms of a debate is very nearly to control the outcome of the debate .
If you start out by thinking of The Matrix , it brings to mind marching robot armies defeating humans after a long struggle — not a superintelligence snapping nanotechnological fingers .
It focuses on an “ Us vs. Them ” struggle , directing attention to questions like “ Who will win ? ” and “ Who should win ? ” and “ Will AIs really be like that ? ”
It creates a general atmosphere of entertainment , of “ What is your amazing vision of the future ? ”
Lost to the echoing emptiness are : considerations of more than one possible mind design that an “ artificial intelligence ” could implement ; the future ’s dependence on initial conditions ; the power of smarter - than - human intelligence and the argument for its unpredictability ; people taking the whole matter seriously and trying to do something about it .
If some insidious corrupter of debates decided that their preferred outcome would be best served by forcing discussants to start out by refuting Terminator , they would have done well in skewing the frame .
Debating gun control , the NRA spokesperson does not wish to be introduced as a “ shooting freak , ” the anti-gun opponent does not wish to be introduced as a “ victim disarmament advocate . ”
Why should you allow the same order of frame - skewing by Hollywood scriptwriters , even accidentally ?
Journalists do n’t tell me , “ The future will be like 2001 . ”
But they ask , “ Will the future be like 2001 , or will it be like A.I. ? ”
This is just as huge a framing issue as asking , “ Should we cut benefits for disabled veterans , or raise taxes on the rich ? ”
In the ancestral environment , there were no moving pictures ; what you saw with your own eyes was true .
A momentary glimpse of a single word can prime us and make compatible thoughts more available , with demonstrated strong influence on probability estimates .
How much havoc do you think a two - hour movie can wreak on your judgment ?
It will be hard enough to undo the damage by deliberate concentration — why invite the vampire into your house ?
In Chess or Go , every wasted move is a loss ; in rationality , any non-evidential influence is ( on average ) entropic .
Do movie - viewers succeed in unbelieving what they see ?
So far as I can tell , few movie viewers act as if they have directly observed Earth ’s future .
People who watched the Terminator movies did n’t hide in fallout shelters on August 29 , 1997 .
But those who commit the fallacy seem to act as if they had seen the movie events occurring on some other planet ; not Earth , but somewhere similar to Earth .
You say , “ Suppose we build a very smart AI , ” and they say , “ But did n’t that lead to nuclear war in The Terminator ? ”
As far as I can tell , it ’s identical reasoning , down to the tone of voice , of someone who might say : “ But did n’t that lead to nuclear war on Alpha Centauri ? ” or “ Did n’t that lead to the fall of the Italian city - state of Piccolo in the fourteenth century ? ”
The movie is not believed , but it is cognitively available .
It is treated , not as a prophecy , but as an illustrative historical case .
Will history repeat itself ?
Who knows ?
In a recent intelligence explosion discussion , someone mentioned that Vinge did n’t seem to think that brain - computer interfaces would increase intelligence much , and cited Marooned in Realtime and Tunç Blumenthal , who was the most advanced traveller but did n’t seem all that powerful .
I replied indignantly , “ But Tunç lost most of his hardware !
He was crippled ! ”
And then I did a mental double - take and thought to myself :
What the hell am I saying .
Does the issue not have to be argued in its own right , regardless of how Vinge depicted his characters ?
Tunç Blumenthal is not “ crippled , ” he ’s unreal .
I could say “ Vinge chose to depict Tunç as crippled , for reasons that may or may not have had anything to do with his personal best forecast , ” and that would give his authorial choice an appropriate weight of evidence .
I cannot say “ Tunç was crippled . ”
There is no was of Tunç Blumenthal .
I deliberately left in a mistake I made , in my first draft of the beginning of this essay : “ Others defend their use of the example , disagreeing that it ’s a fallacy . ”
But The Matrix is not an example !
A neighboring flaw is the logical fallacy of arguing from imaginary evidence : “ Well , if you did go to the end of the rainbow , you would find a pot of gold — which just proves my point ! ”
( Updating on evidence predicted , but not observed , is the mathematical mirror image of hindsight bias . )
The brain has many mechanisms for generalizing from observation , not just the availability heuristic .
You see three zebras , you form the category “ zebra , ” and this category embodies an automatic perceptual inference .
Horse - shaped creatures with white and black stripes are classified as “ Zebras , ” therefore they are fast and good to eat ; they are expected to be similar to other zebras observed .
So people see ( moving pictures of ) three Borg , their brain automatically creates the category “ Borg , ” and they infer automatically that humans with brain - computer interfaces are of class “ Borg ” and will be similar to other Borg observed : cold , uncompassionate , dressing in black leather , walking with heavy mechanical steps .
Journalists do n’t believe that the future will contain Borg — they do n’t believe Star Trek is a prophecy .
But when someone talks about brain - computer interfaces , they think , “ Will the future contain Borg ? ”
Not , “ How do I know computer - assisted telepathy makes people less nice ? ”
Not , “ I ’ve never seen a Borg and never has anyone else . ”
Not , “ I ’m forming a racial stereotype based on literally zero evidence . ”
As George Orwell said of cliches :

What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word , and not the other way around . . .
When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words from the start , and unless you make a conscious effort to prevent it , the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job for you , at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning .
Yet in my estimation , the most damaging aspect of using other authors ’ imaginations is that it stops people from using their own .
As Robert Pirsig said :
5
She was blocked because she was trying to repeat , in her writing , things she had already heard , just as on the first day he had tried to repeat things he had already decided to say .
She could n’t think of anything to write about Bozeman because she could n’t recall anything she had heard worth repeating .
She was strangely unaware that she could look and see freshly for herself , as she wrote , without primary regard for what had been said before .
Remembered fictions rush in and do your thinking for you ; they substitute for seeing — the deadliest convenience of all .
But the worst lemons in the system may be the 34 escalators installed over the past seven years by Fujitec America at a cost of $ 65 million .
They include 12 escalators at the Herald Square subway station in Manhattan that have been plagued by a variety of mechanical problems , Mr. Joyce said .
The motors in two of them vibrated so much that they were shut down for more than five months last year .
Fujitec began building escalators for the transit agency after its equipment was evaluated by Mr. Kenny ’s office to make sure it was robust enough to hold up in the subway .
Mr. Kenny said that it was not unusual for a company that was new to the New York subway to have problems with the first few escalators it installed .
But he said that other companies had been more cooperative in resolving those problems .
Mr. Joyce said that Fujitec was very slow to respond to repair requests , but that in recent months many longstanding problems had been fixed .
“ Fujitec did not intentionally delay anything , ” said Rick Lockridge , director of business development for Fujitec America .
“ But sometimes problems can occur in warranty that take some time to correct . ”
In response to such widespread problems , the transit agency has changed the way it monitors elevator and escalator construction .
For years , contractors installed machines with virtually no oversight from transit employees with expertise in elevators or escalators .
In 2006 , the agency established a special group of mechanics to conduct tests at key stages of construction .
The Disappearing Steps
On the morning of August 28 , Lisa Chiou , 33 , got off a subway train at the Bowling Green station in Lower Manhattan and got on an escalator that would carry her up and out of the station to Broadway .
She placed her right foot ( she was wearing flip - flops ) on the lowest step , and as the escalator rose , she put her left foot on the step below it .
Except all of a sudden , there was no next step .
There was a crash , and Ms. Chiou looked down to see that the escalator step that had been under her left foot had fallen out of the machine .
It sheared off three more steps below it , and Ms. Chiou found herself slipping backward into the void .

The Next Casualty :
Bill of Rights ?
( 13 September 2001 )
From the Los Angeles Times , September 13 , 2001 .
Downloaded from the LA Times Archive .
Marked up by Einde O’Callaghan for REDS – Die Roten .
Tuesday ’s onslaughts on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon are being likened to Pearl Harbor .
The comparison is just .
The attacks were near miracles of logistical calculation , timing , execution and devastation inflicted on the targets .
There may be another similarity .
The possibility of a Japanese attack in early December 1941 was known to U.S. naval intelligence and to President Roosevelt .
On Tuesday , derision at the failure of U.S. intelligence was widespread .
The Washington Post quoted an unnamed top official at the National Security Council as saying , “ We do n’t know anything here .
We ’re watching CNN too . ”
Are we to believe that the $ 30 - billion annual intelligence budget , immense electronic eavesdropping capacity , thousands of agents around the world , produced nothing in the way of a warning ?
In fact , the editor of the London - based Al - Quds al - Arabi newspaper , said he heard three weeks ago that Osama bin Laden , now the prime suspect , planned “ very , very big attacks against American interests . ”
The lust for retaliation traditionally outstrips precision in identifying the actual assailant .
By early evening Tuesday , the U.S. national security establishment was calling for removal of all impediments on the assassination of foreign leaders .
Led by President Bush , they were endorsing the prospect of attacks not just on the perpetrators but on those who might have harbored them .
From the nuclear priesthood comes the demand that mini-nukes be deployed on a preemptive basis against the enemies of America .
The targets abroad will be all the usual suspects – the Taliban or Saddam Hussein , who started off as creatures of U.S. intelligence .
The target at home will be the Bill of Rights .
Less than a week ago the FBI raided Infocom , the Texas - based Web host for Muslim groups such as the Council on Islamic Relations , the Islamic Society of North America , the Islamic Assn. for Palestine and the Holy Land Foundation .
Palestinians have been denied visas , and those in this country can , under the terms of the counterterrorism policy during the Clinton years , be held and expelled without due process .
Tuesday ’s explosions were not an hour old before terror pundits such as Anthony Cordesman , Wesley Clark , Robert Gates and Lawrence Eagleburger were saying that these attacks had been possible “ because America is a democracy , ” adding that now some democratic perquisites might have to be abandoned .
What might this mean ?
Increased domestic snooping by U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies ?
Ethnic profiling ?
A national ID card system ?
Tuesday did not offer a flattering exhibition of America ’s leaders .
President Bush gave a timid and stilted initial reaction in Sarasota , Fla. , then disappeared for an hour before resurfacing in at a base in Barksdale , La. , where he gave another flaccid address with every appearance of being on tranquilizers .
He was then flown to a bunker in Nebraska , before someone finally had the wit to suggest that the best place for the U.S. president at time of national emergency is the Oval Office .
One certain beneficiary of the attacks is Israel .
Polls had been showing popular dislike here for Israel ’s recent tactics , which may have been the motivation for Colin Powell ’s few bleats of reproof to Israel .
We will be hearing no such bleats in the weeks to come , as Israel ’s leaders advise the U.S. how exactly to deal with Muslims .
“ Freedom , ” said Bush in Sarasota , “ was attacked this morning by a faceless coward . ”
That properly represents the stupidity and blindness of almost all of Tuesday ’s mainstream political commentary .
By contrast , the commentary on economic consequences was informative and sophisticated .
Worst hit : the insurance industry .
Likely outfall in the short term : higher energy prices , a further drop in global stock markets .
Bush will have no trouble in raiding the famous lock - box , using Social Security trust funds to give more money to the Defense Department .
Three planes are successfully steered into three of America ’s most conspicuous buildings and America ’s response will be to put more money in missile defense as a way of bolstering the economy .

Concerns about a possible US recession are seeing investors buy up commodities such as gold as an alternative to company shares and the US dollar .
Since the beginning of the year the value of gold has increased by about 20 % , after it rose 32 % in 2007 .
Gold eventually settled for the day at $ 993.80 , up $ 13.30 an ounce .
Analysts say gold will stay high as long as dollar and growth fears remain .
" Every bit of bad US economic data boosts gold in two ways , " said Fortis Bank .
" First because it reinforces the return of its role as a safe - haven asset , and second because the dollar falls on expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts . "
Gold is measured and sold in troy ounces .
One troy ounce equals 31.1035 grams or 480 grains .
One troy ounce is equal to 1.09711 avoirdupois ounce - those widely used to measure weights in the US and UK .
Short term fix ?
The dollar fell further on Thursday against key currencies , including the euro and Japanese yen .
At one point , it was worth less than 100 yen for the first time since 1995 , while it plumbed new depths against the euro at $ 1.5645 .
Analysts are predicting that it could fall further as more details emerge of the losses suffered by banks and hedge funds due to investments centred on the troubled US housing market .
Already many companies have unveiled billions of dollars of losses which has caused credit markets to freeze and has created an environment where there is less money available for consumers and businesses to borrow .
At the same time , there are increasing signs that the US is on the brink of recession .
Official data out on Wednesday showed disappointing retail sales in February .
This has added to the recent drum beat of bad news , including a shrinking of the service sector in January and February , and an unemployment rate that is at its the highest level for five years .
' Cut and inflate '
Despite aggressive interest rate cuts and White House measures to stimulate consumer spending , it is expected that US rates - currently at 3 % - will have to come down further .
Analysts said this will weaken the dollar further and accelerate inflation .
" The Federal Reserve is going to cut and inflate our way out of this credit mess and the implications are going to be higher and sustained inflation , " said Ichael Darda , of MKM Partners .
" That 's been signalled by not just gold but by virtually every commodity and the dollar . "
The oil price surged to a fresh high above $ 110 a barrel earlier , while agricultural commodities , including cocoa and coffee , also rose .
McCain campaign more than a little touchy about the age issue
Barack Obama stopped by CNN ’s “ Situation Room ” yesterday , and Wolf Blitzer asked about John McCain ’s recent assertion that Hamas wants Obama to be president .
Obama noted McCain is wrong on the substance ( Obama and McCain have largely the same position on policy towards Hamas ) , and wrong on the style ( McCain had vowed to take the high road in the campaign ) .
Obama concluded , “ So for him to toss out comments like that I think is an example of him losing his bearings as he pursues this nomination . ”
Marc Salter , one of McCain ’s top aides , soon after issued a memo , blasting Obama ’s choice of words .
[ L ]et us be clear about the nature of Senator Obama ’s attack today :
He used the words ‘ losing his bearings ’ intentionally , a not particularly clever way of raising John McCain ’s age as an issue .
This is typical of the Obama style of campaigning .
We have all become familiar with Senator Obama ’s new brand of politics .
First , you demand civility from your opponent , then you attack him , distort his record and send out surrogates to question his integrity .
It is called hypocrisy , and it is the oldest kind of politics there is .
My , my , a little sensitive about the age issue , are n’t we ?
Maybe Obama was making a subtle dig here , but I really doubt it .
“ Losing his marbles ” ?
Sure .
“ Losing control of his faculties ” ?
No doubt .
But “ losing his bearings ” has nothing to do with age — it refers to someone who has lost their way .
They ’re off track .
They ’re moving in the wrong direction .
The McCain gang probably should have let this one go ; it only serves to remind everyone that McCain would be the oldest president in American history , and that they ’d prefer that this topic remain off limits .
A month ago , Jack Murtha ( a Hillary Clinton supporter ) said , “ [ T ] his one guy running is about as old as me .
And let me tell you something , it ’s not [ an ] old man ’s job . ”
That ’s was a “ not particularly clever way of raising John McCain ’s age as an issue . ”
The McCain campaign ’s overheated response suggests his team is more than a little concerned about how voters will feel about electing a 72 - year - old Washington insider in a time when Americans are desperate for change .
Given the polls , I ca n’t say I blame them .
Post Script : I just have to add that the Salter memo excoriating Obama for using the word “ bearings ” also included this gem :
Senator Obama is hopeful that the media will continue to form a protective barrier around him , declaring serious limits to the questions , discussion and debate in this race .
Senator Obama has good reason to think this plan will succeed , as serious journalists have written of the need for ‘ de - tox ’ to cure ‘ swooning ’ over Senator Obama , and others have admitted to losing their objectivity while with him on the campaign trail .
Ca n’t … type … laughing … too … hard …
GM Engineers Say All Cars Should Have Gas Mileage Displays
Last week I spent some time with GM discussing their new HCCI technology .
After taking their test vehicle , a Saturn Aura , for a test spin , I was very impressed with the heads up display ( HUD ) that kept track of whether the car was in HCCI or SI mode .
Upon returning to the conference room , my first question for the GM techs was whether or not something indicating HCCI mode or gas mileage would show up on the production models of cars equipped with this technology .
I do n’t know quite what I expected for an answer , but it certainly was n’t the one I got .
Paul Najt seemed to like the question , and came to the same conclusion that I ’ve long had , which is that fuel economy can become like a game .
Cars ( like many hybrids ) with fuel economy displays were mentioned , and some in the room even commented that they believed the knowledge would automatically make people try to get better fuel economy .
More after the break !
I agreed heartily , but I did n’t expect the final answer : “ It ’s ultimately a marketing decision . ”
While this makes sense , do n’t you think that some control should be left in the hands of the engineers ?
I mean , GM is asking their people to design a fuel efficient engine to get people through this gas crunch and into the future while still being economically viable , but it ’s not the engineers that get to decide if a $ 10 piece of electronics will be part of that effort ?
While I was there I was also told by an engineer who ’d recently moved to the US from Germany that in the US people sometimes drive cars that are plain “ unnecessary . ”
Coming from Germany , he and his family were used to a market for much smaller cars , one that GM and its Opel brand is a part of .
However , it seems that globally General Motors is in the business of selling what people want , and not necessarily what people need .
This mentality is certainly understandable from a business perspective , but I implore GM to consider that if marketing research shows that people do n’t want fuel economy displays , it ’s because they do n’t know how much the feedback could improve their gas mileage .
Seeing that this is one of the things that makes the Prius so popular , and something that other manufacturers are phasing in , I hope GM pushes on with it .
Do you think they will , or are ye of little faith ( as I sometimes , admittedly , am ) ?

Germany is Europe 's biggest economy
Economic growth in the eurozone during the first three months of 2008 was better than expected , figures show .
Gross domestic product ( GDP ) rose by 0.7 % from the previous quarter in the 15 nations using the euro , compared with the 0.5 % growth analysts expected .
Eurozone GDP was up by 2.2 % compared with the same quarter in 2007 .
Separately , Eurostat confirmed that eurozone inflation in April slowed to 3.3 % year - on - year from March 's record figure of 3.6 % .
The strong GDP growth in Europe was " a last hurrah for the eurozone economy " said Fortis economist , Nick Kounis .
The strength of the euro and a fall - off in global growth would dent exports he said , taking their toll on the economy .
And he added that consumer spending growth would only be " moderate " , as rising inflation offset wage growth and strong employment .
' Sensational '
Figures from Germany 's Federal Statistics
Office showed the economy grew at its fastest pace in more than 10 years during the first three months of 2008 .
GDP grew 1.5 % in the quarter , almost double the figure that analysts had forecast , and up from 0.3 % in the final three months of 2007 .
The statistics office said it showed the economy was " robust " despite wider economic problems .
Germany 's growth , its fastest pace since 1996 , was " sensational " said Commerzbank economist Matthias Rubisch .
" The forecasts for this full year will have to be revised upwards after this strong start . "
The government had forecast that 2008 growth would be 1.7 % but Mr Rubisch said this could now be above 2 % , .
This compares with 2.5 % growth in 2007 .
Meanwhile , France said that its GDP had grown by 0.6 % in the first quarter of 2008 , ahead of predicitions .
And it revised its 2007 growth up to 2.2 % , from the 1.9 % previously forecast .
Discarded computer parts could one day wind up fueling your car .
That 's because researchers in Romania and Turkey have developed a simple , efficient method for recycling printed circuit boards into environmentally - friendly raw materials for use in fuel , plastic , and other useful consumer products .
The boom in the use of computers has also created one of the world 's biggest environmental headaches :
What to do with all the discarded circuit boards , which contain high levels of pollutants such as heavy metals and flame retardants that can potentially harm humans ?
Researchers are seeking ways to remove these toxins so that these scrap materials can be safely recycled .
In the new study , Cornelia Vasile and colleagues collected printed circuit boards from discarded computers and processed the boards with a combination of high temperatures , catalysts , and chemical filtration .
The processing method removed almost all of the toxic substances from the scraps , resulting in oils that can be safely used as fuel or raw materials called feedstocks for a wide variety of consumer products , the researchers say .
Swedish furniture giant IKEA claims to have drastically reduced the cost of a family funeral with it ’s new self - assembly plywood coffin .
The flatpack coffin comes in twelve ‘ easy - to - assemble ’ parts and can be put together ‘ in under an hour ’ by grieving relatives .
‘ It was good to get my mind off things ’ said bereaved grandson Geoff Cooper , 35 .
‘ I was tearful when I started to work out which bit went where .
But after two hours I was shouting and swearing and throwing the little Allen key across the room .
When we finally lowered the coffin into the ground , it fell to pieces and granddad ’s limbs all fell out . ’
But other families have welcomed the saving that the self - assembly sarcophagus represents .
‘ We wanted to save cash on the coffin for our gran because we did n’t like her ’ said Elizabeth Jamieson from Croydon .
‘ So we got her to assemble the coffin herself before she croaked .
It took her three and a half days to put it together .
Ironically it was probably that what finished her off . ’
Professor Thurman , a former monk himself , describes himself as a friend and admirer of Mr. Roach , and said that after the geshe made his relationship with Ms. McNally public in 2003 , he begged him to renounce his monastic vows and to stop wearing the robes that mark him as a member of a monastic order .
Mr. Roach declined , and the two have not spoken since .
“ He is doing this partnership thing and insisting on being a monk , ” Professor Thurman said .
“ It is superhuman .
He says he is staying celibate , but people find it hard to believe . ”
The yurt in which Mr. Roach and Ms. McNally live when they are not traveling the world ( which is often about half the year ) sits in the high desert some 100 miles east of Tucson , on a platform overlooking a rift in the cactus - speckled hills .
For 100 acres around , the land is the property of Diamond Mountain University , an unaccredited school that Mr. Roach founded with Ms. McNally in 2004 to teach Buddhist principles and translation skills .
Although devoid of modern conveniences , the yurt they live in , which is 22 feet in diameter , feels almost luxurious compared with the spare , desiccated landscape around it .
On one side of the tent is their double bed , and beside it a commode elegantly disguised as a wood side table .
The floor is covered with carpets .
A few carved wooden chests hold clothes and pillows .
Light streams in from a hole at the center of the tent ’s roof , illuminating its poles , which were imported from Mongolia .
The closeness to nature means that the indoor temperature is essentially the ambient one — beyond baking in the summer and freezing in the winter .
( Their one attempt to battle the elements is a wood - burning stove . )
The couple did a three - year silent retreat in this yurt from 2000 to 2003 , while their relationship was a secret to all but the few people who brought them food .
Soon afterward , Mr. Roach determined it should be public , even if it flew in the face of two millenniums of Tibetan Buddhist tradition .
He acted for two reasons , he said .
One , he felt that it was impossible to keep secrets in this age of Google Earth .
Two , he decided that if Buddhism was really going to succeed in America , it would have to be more inclusive of women .
Frida Kahlo an exhibition at the Walker Art Center , Minneapolis , October 27 , 2007 – January 20 , 2008 ; the Philadelphia Museum of Art , February 20 –May 18 , 2008 ; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , June 16 – September 28 , 2008 .
Catalog of the exhibition edited by Elizabeth Carpenter , co-curator with Hayden Herrera .
Walker Art Center / DAP,320 pp. , $ 49.95
Frida Kahlo was an ironic and devilish person , and so she might be intrigued by the thought that , for this writer , at least , her finest single work is in an outward respect her least typical .
Kahlo is known , of course , for her many unsparing self - portraits , images where she can confront us with tears on her cheeks or exhibit herself as a bedridden patient or victim .
They present a woman who , facing us as well with her distinctive and unforgettable dark , unbroken , single eyebrow and clear suggestion of a mustache , and often wearing clothes or accompanied by details that are redolent of her native Mexico , exudes a smoldering fury — an expressionist tension that , until recent decades , was rarely encountered in the work of women artists .
The Suicide of Dorothy Hale , however , a painting dated 1939 which shows exactly that , a woman killing herself , has a New York City setting and has as its protagonist a formally and elegantly dressed woman who is not remotely like any other figure in the painter ’s work .
At the traveling Kahlo retrospective currently at the Philadelphia Museum of Art , an exhibition geared to the centennial of her birth , in 1907 ( she died in 1954 ) , no other picture had the degree of experimentation , the luminosity , or the graphic clarity of this painting , either .
Dorothy
Hale was a socialite and something of a friend of Kahlo ’s who had lost her husband and become psychologically adrift and financially desperate .
She committed suicide by jumping from her apartment in the Hampshire House , on Central Park South , and from the incident Kahlo made a picture that is as witty and ingenious as it is mordant and disturbing .
In the painting , which , like most of her work , is fairly small , the white skyscraper appears like a mirage emanating from the kind of deadpan perfect blue sky , covered with deadpan perfect cottony clouds , one would find in a contemporaneous work by Magritte .
Near the top of the building , in part of the painting that recalls images of people jumping from the World Trade Center , we see a tiny , dark , plummeting figure .
In the center of the picture a more clearly visible person falls twistedly before us , while at the bottom , on a ledge which could be a sidewalk , Hale lies dead , her eyes open and staring at us .
Her body seems unscathed although blood seeps out from under her onto the frame , which has been painted so as to be a continuation of the scene .
Blood also seems to form the words in the strip at the bottom of the picture that tell us , in Spanish , what we are looking at and who painted it .
Brilliantly conceived as a design and as a way to present , in a single image , a number of events taking place over a passage of time , Kahlo ’s picture keeps our eyes continually moving over its entire surface .
Even better is its pulsating , wonderfully tricky sense of space .
With the “ story ” of the scene continued onto the frame and with …

The Facts
Today crude oil hit a record price , just over $ 112 per barrel at its highest .
The price for a barrel of oil jumped almost $ 3 over the last two days on the news that fuel supplies were low .
Many industry experts think a barrel of oil will hit $ 120 pretty soon .
UPDATE : Today , April 28 , 2008 , OPEC president said there is no reason for oil not to go to $ 200 per barrel .
And others are talking about the same thing that I talk about below .
Two of Neil Cavuto ’s guests on Fox News were saying on Saturday , April 26 , 2008 that demand for oil and gasoline is falling .
Mike Norman was saying speculators had turned oil trading into a “ casino atmosphere ” .
Norman continued on by saying the last $ 30 - $ 40 run up of oil and the last $ 1 in gasoline was due to speculators .
Tyson Slocum said that we have to start regulating the energy trading markets .
Read the transcript .
An example of this speculator scam happened last Friday , April 25 , 2008 at 10:00 AM .
The price of oil jumped up over $ 1 because a US contractor ship in the Persian Gulf fired warning shots at two Iranian patrol boats .
This action had no effect on oil production ; rather it was just another excuse for speculators and traders to run the price of oil up .
My View
Back in November of last year I wrote a post about 100 dollar oil , 4 dollar gas .
That was about the time that Wall Street traders had decided that gouging the price of oil was a very easy way to make a lot more money off oil than they had in the past .
In other words , they decided they would start controlling the price of oil instead of the oil companies doing it .
Not that the oil companies were n’t doing a good job at controlling the prices at a level they wanted , much like DeBeers does with diamonds .
Last month I wrote a post about the president of Shell Oil ’s US operations , John Hofmeister , saying that triple digit oil was way out of line ; that 85 % of the oil in the Gulf of Mexico OCS was inaccessible ; and that we were no where near running out of oil as suggested by most of the so - called experts .
He is the only executive of an oil company that will even allude to price gouging .
So what does this tell us ?
Since supply & demand is no longer dictating the price of oil and gasoline , then what is ; it ’s our oil traders .
Supply & demand has been replaced with maneuverable tactics driven by greed .
What will this lead to ?
Left up to these greedy traders , oil will hit $ 200 or more per barrel and gas will hit $ 10 or more per gallon .
The results will be tens of thousands of companies going out of business , hundreds of thousands of jobs , maybe millions , lost , and consumers will suffer a fate many times worse than those during the depression that followed the stock market crash of 1929 .
And what for ?
So a few traders and a few very rich people can make a lot of money .
That will be about the time that oil will drop to about $ 20 per barrel because no one can afford to buy anything , including gasoline .
Is n’t a free market great ?
One TPM Reader goes rational on President Bush …
When President Bush decries “ the false comfort of appeasement , ” and John McCain raises the spectre of Neville Chamberlain , they ’re deliberately advancing a fallacious line of argument .
Appeasement – the acceptance of conditions imposed by an aggressor in lieu of open conflict – is not the result of negotiation , but of capitulation .
And the inverse proposition – the rejection of all negotiation even at the price of open conflict – is
just as rigidly obtuse .
We call it war - mongering .
I do n’t particularly mind that our President has chosen to air a domestic dispute abroad – that ’s his perogative .
And I ’ve always been miffed by the notion that foreign policy is for the experts , and too delicate a matter to be subject to public debate or the people ’s will – what the establishment terms ‘ politicization . ’
But I ’m incensed that the coverage has focused on whether or not Obama ’s support of negotiations constitutes appeasement , as if this were subject to dispute .
It ’s not .
He has never proposed giving in to our enemies .
His support of negotiation constitutes , ipso facto , a rejection of appeasement .
There are not two valid sides to this dispute .
For the media to accede to this kind of slander , just because it ’s what the GOP demands , well , it borders on appeasement .
COMMON MYTHS ABOUT HISTORY
By Tim Lambert
There are many myths about history !
Most of us have grown up with them .
This article looks at some of the most common historical myths .
General myths about the past
In the past 9 out of 10 people died before the age of 40
This is not true .
We do not know exactly what average life expectancy at birth was in the past but historians think it was about 35 years in the Middle Ages .
However that does not mean that people dropped dead when they reached 35 !
Average life expectancy at birth was around 35 but a great many of the people born died in childhood .
We do n't know exactly what percentage died but if we say about 25 % of people died before they were 5 years old we are probably not wide of the mark .
Perhaps as many as 40 % died before they reached adulthood .
However if you could survive childhood and your teenage years you had a good chance of living to your 50s or your early 60s and even in the Middle Ages there were some people who lived to 70 or 80 .
A History of Life Expectancy in England
People in the past were much smaller than we are
In reality people were slightly smaller .
Skeletons from the Mary Rose show the sailors were , on average , between 5 foot 7 inches and 5 foot 8 inches tall .
Burial grounds from the Middle Ages and other periods also show that people were , on average , a little bit shorter than modern - day people but they were not much smaller .
People in the past were very dirty and rarely washed themselves
In fact there is considerable evidence that most people tried to keep themselves clean .
The evidence also suggests that most people washed and changed their clothes quite frequently .
They also tried to keep their houses clean .
The idea that people were filthy and stunk is a myth .
The myth may have arisen because people rarely took baths .
Before the 19th century , it was difficult to heat a large amount of water in one go Suppose you heated a cauldron of water and poured it into a tub .
By the time you had heated a second lot of water the first lot would already be cold .
The Romans solved this problem by having public baths , which could be heated from underneath .
However , after the fall of Rome , it was much easier to have a strip wash .
In hot weather people bathed in rivers .
There is also evidence that people washed their clothes quite often .
In the past a man had a right to beat his wife provided he did not use a stick thicker than his thumb
There has never been a rule or a law in England that a man is entitled to beat his wife provided he uses a stick no thicker than his thumb .
William Blackstone ( 1723 -80 ) wrote Commentaries on the Laws of England ( 1765 -1769 ) .
He made no mention of a supposed rule that a stick could be used to hit your wife if it was not thicker than a thumb .
So it was never a part of English common law .
We are not certain how the phrase ' rule of thumb ' arose but it probably came from craftsmen using their thumbs to measure .
Cave people were brutes and morons
Evidence shows that the Neanderthals were caring .
One Neanderthal survived despite having a withered arm and deformed feet who was blind in one eye .
He could only have survived with the help of the other members of the group .
So clearly Neanderthals cared for the disabled .
Neanderthals also buried their dead .
Anyway , the Neanderthals must have been resourceful to survive in a harsh environment .
The later Cro-Magnon people made necklaces of stones and shells ( like us they liked wearing jewellery ) .
Cro-Magnon people also created art .
They made highly skilled cave paintings and made musical instruments like bone flutes .

Myths about the Ancient World
The Druids built Stonehenge
In reality Stonehenge is much older than the Druids .
About 650 BC a people called the Celts arrived in England and their priests were called Druids .
However Stonehenge is much older .
It is believed it was built in stages between about 3,100 BC and 1,500 BC .
The Druids Practiced Human Sacrifice
This is probably a myth .
The ' evidence ' that Druids sacrificed people is , to say the least unreliable .
See The Druids
We can't be certain but its probably a myth .
Julius Caesar was a cesarean birth
Almost certainly this is untrue as his mother lived for many years after his birth ( it would normally be fatal for the mother ) .
However , the myth that Julius Caesar was born that way may be why this operation is called a cesarean birth .
Slaves built the pyramids
In fact they were built by free men .
Pharoah provided them with food and shelter .
The Philistines were uncultured
Today if you call somebody a Philistine it means they are ignorant , unrefined and tasteless .
That is unfair as the Philistines were actually a highly civilized people .
In Rome a ' thumb up ' signal meant let a defeated gladiator live but a ' thumb down ' signal meant kill him
In reality ' thumb up ' meant kill him !
If the thumb was concealed in a fist it meant let him live .
There was no ' thumb down ' signal .
Roman gladiators
Roman Galleys were rowed by slaves
In fact the men who rowed Roman galleys were , usually , free men who joined the navy of their own accord .
In reality rowing a galley was highly skilled work .
Caligula made his horse a senator
In fact there is no record of Caligula actually making his horse a senator .
Nero played the fiddle while Rome burned
The fiddle was not invented till centuries after his death .
It is sometimes said that Nero actually played the lyre while Rome burned .
He did not do that either .
In reality , Nero was staying some distance from Rome when the fire began in 64 AD .
Nero rushed to the city and did everything he could to help .
Myths about the Middle Ages
The Arabs burned the library of Alexandria
This is very unlikely to be true .
In ancient times there was a great library at Alexandria in Egypt .
According to the story when the Arabs conquered Egypt in 640 AD Caliph Omar ordered all the books in the library to be burned .
They supplied fuel for the saunas for 6 months ( a quite fantastic figure ) .
However , the story was not written down till the late 12th century more than 500 years late .
If it is true why did nobody at the time write about it ?.
It is now believed that the library of Alexandria expired long before the Arab conquest .
There was once a female Pope called Pope Joan
This is almost certainly a myth .
According to the story a female Pope reigned for more than 2 years from 855 to 858 .
( In reality , Leo IV reigned from 847 to 855 and Benedict III reigned from 855 to 888 .
There was a gap of only a few weeks between them ) .
However , the first mention of a female Pope was 200 years after she is supposed to have reigned .
If the story is true why did nobody write about it at the time ?
It would have caused a sensation throughout Europe so why did nobody mention it at the time ?
King John signed the Magna Carta
King John sealed the Magna Carta by pressing a seal into hot wax but he did not sign it .
In the Middle Ages scholars spent hours debating how many angels could stand on the head of a pin
There is no evidence that anybody in the Middle Ages asked this ridiculous question .
In the Middle Ages some armor was so heavy knights sometimes had to be lifted onto their horses with ropes
This is quite untrue .
Armour was heavy but certainly not that heavy .
As The Year 1000 AD approached people across Europe panicked .
They feared that Jesus Christ was about to return and the World would end
There is no evidence that any such panic occurred .
No writer of the time mentioned anything unusual .
It was not till hundreds of years later that writers claimed that people panicked as the year 1000 approached .
Vikings wore helmets with horns on
There is no evidence that Vikings ever wore horned helmets when they went into battle .
There is no evidence either that Vikings wore helmets with wings on .
Joan of Arc was burned as a witch
This is not true .
Joan of Arc was burned for heresy ( because she dressed as a man ) .
Before Columbus people thought the world was flat
This is a myth !
In the Middle Ages , people were well aware that the world is round .
The ancient Greeks were well aware of it and they invented the globe .
Ironically the oldest surviving globe was made in 1492 the same year Columbus made his first voyage .
In the 16th century , the great explorer Ferdinand Magellan ( died 1521 ) is supposed to have said ' The Church says the Earth is flat , but I know that it is round , for I have seen the shadow of the moon , and I have more faith in a shadow than in the Church ' .
Of course , Magellan did not say any such thing since the Church did not say the Earth is flat .
This " quote " first appeared in the late 19th century , 350 years after his death .
Columbus Was The First European to Discover America
He was not .
Obviously , the ancestors of today 's Native Americans entered North America thousands of years before Columbus .
Furthermore , Columbus was not even the first European to discover America .
The first European to sight the continent was Bjarni Herjolfsson about 985 AD .
About 15 years later a man named Leif Ericsson led an expedition to the new land .
However , the Vikings failed to establish a permanent colony .
Golf is an acronym of ' gentlemen only ladies forbidden '
The word golf is derived from an old Dutch word ' kolf ' which meant club .
( In the Middle Ages the Dutch played games with clubs but golf proper began in Scotland ) .
The Scots changed the word slightly to ' golve ' or ' Goff ' and in time it became our word golf .
Archers carried their arrows on their backs
They only did so if they were riding horses .
Normally , when on foot archers would carry arrows in containers attached to their belts .
( It is much easier to retrieve a longbow arrow from your belt than from over your shoulder ) .
Most churchyards in England have a yew tree so men could use the yew's wood to make bows
This is almost certainly a myth .
Records show that bowyers preferred to use yew from Southern or Eastern Europe to make bows .
( English yew was not particularly good for that purpose ) .
The two finger gesture was invented because the French threatened to cut 2 fingers off captured English archers .
The English archers waved 2 fingers as a symbol of defiance .
Nobody really knows where the two - finger gesture comes from but there is no evidence that it has anything to do with Medieval archery .
Nor is there any evidence that the French ever threatened to cut the fingers off captured archers .
The gesture was first recorded in 1901 .
In the Middle Ages spices were used to disguise the taste of tainted meat
This is not true for a simple reason - spices were very expensive and only the rich could afford them .
The rich , of course , did not eat tainted meat .
They only ate the best quality of meat !
In reality , spices were used to enhance the taste of meat .

Myths about the Modern Era
Henry VIII had syphilis
This is unlikely to be true .
In the 16th century the standard treatment for syphilis was mercury .
Lists of money spent on medicines for Henry VIII exist but mercury is not listed .
Therefore it is unlikely he had syphilis .
Anne Boleyn had six fingers
This is almost certainly a myth .
She may have had a small extra fingernail growing at the side of one of her fingers .
If the story is true that may be the basis of the rumour .
However nobody who lived at the same time as Anne or shortly afterwards said anything about six fingers .
It was not till almost 50 years later that the story that Anne Boleyn had six fingers appeared .
Also , it is very unlikely that any Tudor king would marry a woman with such an obvious physical deformity .
Sirloin got its name because an English king once knighted a piece of meat and called it ' Sir loin '
In reality sirloin is a corruption of the French sur ( above or on top of ) loin .
The Mary Rose sank on her maiden voyage
The Mary Rose was built in Portsmouth in 1509 - 1511 .
She did not sink till 1545 , by which time she was quite an old warship .
The Mary Rose
In Tudor times if you had an operation the barber - surgeon hit you on the head with a wooden mallet to knock you unconscious
This is not true .
You could kill or seriously injure somebody if you hit him or her with a wooden mallet .
There is no evidence that a barber - surgeon hit people over the head with a mallet .
Detailed instructions for barber - surgeons survive but there is no mention of such a procedure .
Walter Raleigh introduced smoking and potatoes into England
The Spanish learnt to smoke tobacco from indigenous people .
It is believed that English sailors adopted the habit about 1564 ( Walter Raleigh was born in 1552 ) .
At any rate smoking tobacco in clay pipes was already quite common in England by the time Walter Raleigh was an adult .
There is also no evidence that Raleigh introduced potatoes into England .
Potatoes are native to South America .
The Spanish took them to Europe .
From Spain potatoes spread to England and Ireland .
When the Tudors ate meat at feasts they threw the bones onto the floor for dogs to eat
In the 16th century such behavior was unacceptable .
In the 16th century dogs were not allowed at feasts and when you ate meat you placed the bones in a special dish .
Witches were burned
This is partly true .
In England and its colonies in North America witches were normally hanged .
However they were burned in Scotland and the rest of Europe .
Matthew Hopkins the ' Witchfinder General ' was accused of being a witch , tried and executed
This is unlikely to be true .
In 1645 - 46 Matthew Hopkins was paid to ' discover ' witches in East Anglia and was undoubtedly responsible for the deaths of many innocent people .
However , he fell from favor in 1646 when a clergyman called John Gaule wrote about him and denounced him .
Hopkins is believed to have died in 1647 .
However nobody in the 17th century wrote that Hopkins was tried and executed or that he was lynched .
That story arose much later .
Instead in the middle of the 17th century , somebody who actually knew Hopkins wrote that he died of natural causes .
That is much more likely .
Only women were executed for witchcraft
The majority of people executed for witchcraft in Western Europe and North America in the 16th and 17th centuries were female but by no means all .
A significant minority of the people executed were male .
My Youtube video about myths about women 's history
The Puritans only wore black clothes
They did sometimes wear black clothes .
However in reality the Puritans wore many other colors ( red , green etc ) .
Four Poster Beds had canopies to catch mice falling from thatched roofs
Four - poster beds had canopies and curtains to keep out drafts .
( Old houses had many drafts ) .
There is no evidence that the canopy was designed to catch falling rodents .
In any case , a four - poster bed was very expensive .
If you were wealthy enough to afford one you would normally have a roof of tiles , not thatch .
Even if you did have a thatched roof in a wealthy home all bedrooms had proper ceilings .
So there was a ceiling between the bed and the roof .
Dick Turpin rode his horse Black Bess from London to York in 12 Hours
Dick Turpin 1705 - 1739 did not own a horse called Black Bess nor did he make the famous ride .
Far from being a heroic figure Turpin was actually a brutal robber .
A History of Highwaymen
When Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752 and 2 September was followed by 14 September there were riots and demands of ' give us back our 11 days ! ' because people thought their lives were being shortened by 11 days
It is doubtful if these riots really took place although changing the calendar was certainly unpopular and some people continued to celebrate Christmas Day using the old calendar for long afterwards .
A History of Clocks and Calendars
Dr. Guillotin invented the Guillotine
This is not true .
In fact mechanical devices for beheading people had been used in various parts of Europe for centuries before the French Revolution .
( One was recorded in Ireland as early as 1307 ) .
Joseph - Ignace Guillotin ( 1738 - 1814 ) was elected a member of the French National Assembly in 1789 .
He proposed that there should be a swift and humane method of executing people in France .
( And compared to many gruesome methods of executing people in 18th century Europe the guillotine certainly was humane ) .
The Assembly finally agreed to his idea in 1791 and the first decapitating device was built by a man named Tobias Schmidt , with advice from a surgeon named Antoine Louis .
Marie - Antoinette said ' Let them eat cake '
When told that the peasants had no bread to eat the French Queen Marie - Antoinette is supposed to have said ' let them eat cake !
( or brioche ) .
In reality , there is no evidence that she ever said that .
Captain Cook discovered Australia
Of course human beings lived in Australia for 40,000 years before Europeans discovered it .
In reality Australia was known to Europeans long before Captain Cook sailed there .
The first European to land in Australia was Dutchman Willem Janszoon in 1606 .
He was followed by many other Europeans in the 17th century and the 18th century .
Captain Cook charted the east coast of Australia in 1770 .
He claimed it for Britain and named it New South Wales .
Nelson wore a patch over one eye
In fact , although Nelson was blind in one eye there is no evidence he wore a patch .
Thomas Crapper invented the flushing toilet
The flushing toilet was known in the ancient world e.g. to the Minoans of ancient Crete .
Furthermore , the flushing toilet was re-invented in the late 16th century by John Harrington .
However , the idea did not catch on .
The flushing toilet was reinvented again in the late 18th century , by Joseph Bramah , before Thomas Crapper ( 1836 -1910 ) was born .
A History of Toilets
In 1899 the Head of the American Patent Office said that the patent office should be closed because everything that could be invented had been invented
There is no evidence that the Head of the Patent Office ever said that .

Larger version Sunday Parkways route map .
Sunday Parkways — the City of Portland ’s first - ever , large - scale carfree event — is all set for this Sunday ( 6/22 ) from 8:00 am to 2:00 pm .
PDOT ’s Transportation Options division first unveiled their plans for the event nearly one year ago .
Since then , they ’ve executed a comprehensive and strategic plan to make sure the event is a success .
They ’ve met with hundreds of neighborhood groups , they ’ve had meetings with leaders of churches along the route , and they ’ve lined up a myriad of performers , live music , food , and other activities to keep things interesting .
Now all that ’s left to do is make sure everyone shows up and hope it goes well enough so that we can make it a regular occurrence .
In speaking with Gil Penalosa in recent days ( the Godfather of “ ciclovias “ , which inspired Portland ’s event ) , he warned against planning the event for just one day :
“ Portland should be doing it all summer …
I think the most dangerous thing of a carfree Sunday is to do only one .
I always recommend doing three or four .
On the first Sunday , you always have problems and complaints from people that could n’t get through .
The second Sunday people figure out how to get around it , they ’re used to .
By the third Sunday , everybody thinks it ’s fantastic , they love it , and they want more .
Sometimes when you stop after three or four , everybody wants more … sometimes when you stop after only one , some people want less , so I think that ’s a risk and I wish Portland was doing more . ”
At the recently concluded Carfree Conference , we learned that similar events are springing up all over the country ( and the world ) .
Major cities like San Francisco , New York City , and Chicago have all recently announced plans for large - scale carfree events .
Each of those cities has planned at least two separate days of closures .
Whether or not Portland made the right decision in having it for one day only , Penalosa — who plans to attend Sunday ’s event — says there ’s a lot riding on the success of Sunday Parkways :
“ I think all of North America will benefit from Portland ’s success , so all of us are pulling for Portland ’s success with this event …
It would raise the bar everyone . ”

New information about the heart of one of the most famous objects in the sky -- the Crab Pulsar in the Crab Nebula -- has been revealed by an international team of scientists searching for gravitational waves .
The team 's achievement also is the first direct look into the interior of a neutron star .
The research team detected signals from the pulsar -- a rapidly spinning neutron star -- with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational - Wave Observatory ( LIGO ) .
The analysis of the signals reveals that has shown that no more than 4 percent of the energy loss of the pulsar is caused by the emission of gravitational waves .
This long - awaited analysis is one of LIGO 's first landmark results , bringing the search for gravitational waves into the outskirts of the realm of theoretical predictions made several years ago by Ben Owen , assistant professor of physics at Penn State .
Owen is a co-author of the paper describing the discovery , which will be submitted to Astrophysical Journal Letters by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration , a 600 - member group in which Penn State plays a key role .
The Crab Nebula , located 6,500 light years away in the constellation Taurus , was formed in a spectacular supernova explosion in 1054 .
It was visible in daylight for more than three weeks and may briefly have been brighter than the full moon .
Ancient Chinese texts referred to the extraordinary event as a " guest star . "
Today , at the heart of the Crab Nebula , remains an incredibly rapidly rotating neutron star that sweeps two narrow radio beams across the Earth each time it spins .
The lighthouse - like radio pulses have given the star the name " pulsar . "
" The Crab Pulsar is spinning at a rate of 30 times per second .
However , its rotation rate is decreasing rapidly relative to most pulsars , indicating that it is radiating energy at a prodigious rate , " says Graham Woan of the University of Glasgow , who co-led the science group that used LIGO data to analyze the Crab Pulsar , along with Michael Landry of the LIGO Hanford Observatory .
Pulsars , which are only 10 km in radius yet contain more mass than the Sun , are almost perfect spheres made up of neutrons .
Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space and time and are an important consequence of Einstein 's general theory of relativity .
Gravitational - wave emission is one of the few physical mechanisms hypothesized for the pulsar 's energy loss and the accompanying slowing of its spin , but the scenario that gravitational waves significantly " brake " the Crab pulsar has been disproved by the new analysis .
" These results strongly imply that no more than 4 percent of the pulsar 's energy loss is due to gravitational radiation , " Michael Landry said .
" The remainder of the loss must be due to other mechanisms , such as a combination of electromagnetic radiation generated by the rapidly rotating magnetic field of the pulsar and the emission of high - velocity particles into the nebula . "
LIGO scientists monitored the neutron star from November 2005 to August 2006 using data from the three LIGO interferometers , which were combined to create a single , highly sensitive detector .
They compared the LIGO data with published data about the pulsar 's rotation rate from the Jodrell Bank Observatory , looking for a synchronous gravitational - wave signal .
The analysis revealed no signs of gravitational waves -- a result the scientists say is important because it provides information about the pulsar and its structure .
They say a perfectly smooth neutron star will not generate gravitational waves as it spins , and that LIGO would have been able to detect gravitational waves from a star whose shape was deformed by only a few meters .
Such distortion could occur in a young neutron star , like the Crab Pulsar , whose crust could still be semisolid , or in a star with an enormous magnetic field .
According to Ben Owen , " What LIGO really adds is that we can see more than skin deep .
Astronomers see plenty of electromagnetic waves ( radio waves , x- rays , and so on ) from the Crab , but pulsars are so dense that even the x-rays can't get through the interior and you can only see down to the surface .
But gravitational waves can get through , so our result is the first direct look into a neutron star 's interior . "
Joseph Taylor , a Nobel Prize - winning radio astronomer and professor of physics at Princeton University , says , " The physics world has been waiting eagerly for scientific results from LIGO .
It is exciting that we now know something concrete about how nearly spherical a neutron star must be , and we have definite limits on the strength of its internal magnetic field . "
Looking to the future of research with LIGO , Ben Owen adds , " For a long time particle physicists have predicted a lot of strange possibilities for neutron star interiors , like neutrons dissolving into more fundamental particles called quarks .
As LIGO 's sensitivity improves , we can explore more of those possibilities .
If we see a strong signal in the next couple of years , it will be strong evidence that these strange states of matter exist . "

SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico ( AP ) —
The Pentagon has dropped charges against a Saudi at Guantanamo who was alleged to have been the so - called " 20th hijacker " in the Sept. 11 attacks , his U.S. military defense lawyer said Monday .
Mohammed al - Qahtani was one of six men charged by the military in February with murder and war crimes for their alleged roles in the 2001 attacks .
Authorities say al - Qahtani missed out on taking part in the attacks because he was denied entry to the U.S. by an immigration agent .
But in reviewing the case , the convening authority for military commissions , Susan Crawford , decided to dismiss the charges against al - Qahtani and proceed with the arraignment for the other five , said Army Lt. Col.
Bryan Broyles , the Saudi 's military lawyer .
LOS ANGELES ( thefutoncritic.com ) -- Sci
Fi is importing the short - lived Canadian / South African - drama " Charlie Jade " as the series will join its Friday lineup on June 6 at 8:00 / 7:00 c .
The news was just one of several announcements made by the network at the NBC Universal Summer Press Day yesterday .
" Jade , " which ran for 20 episodes on Canada 's SPACE channel in 2005 , is detailed by said network as follows : " What if humans did n't abuse the earth and its resources ?
How different would the world be ?
Take a fantastic leap of the imagination and explore the world through three parallel universes - Alphaverse ( what our world could end up being ) , Betaverse ( our world today ) , and Gammaverse ( what our world could have been ) .
Charlie Jade is a rogue detective in Alphaverse who , while on the hunt for the killer of a missing woman , gets caught in an explosion from a covert desert operation , propelling him into a strange parallel universe ( Betaverse ) .
As he searches for the truth about the explosion , he is drawn into a conflict that not only involves his home universe and the one he now inhabits , but another pristine pacifist universe ( Gammaverse ) with unsuspected terror at its heart . "
Jeffrey Pierce toplines the cast , which also includes Patricia Mackenzie , Michael Filipowich , Marie - Julie Rivest , David Dennis and Tyrone Benskin .
Meanwhile , Mark Stern , Sci Fi's original programming chief , confirmed that two - time Oscar nominee Peter Fonda has joined the cast of the network 's two - hour backdoor pilot " Revolution . "
He 'll play the industrialist grandfather of the Hart family .
Billy Campbell , Brooklyn Sudano , David Smith , Rowena King and Steve Sandvoss also star in the project , which revolves around the simmering unrest at New America , " a colony settled by the now - named ' United State of America ' on a planet resembling our own , located 50 light years away . "
Also confirmed by the network on Friday : -- " Eureka " will return for its third season in July with the first of 21 new episodes .
Said season - likely due on Tuesday , July 29 at 9:00 / 8:00 c - will not surprisingly be split into two halves .
Executive producers Charlie Craig and Jaime Paglia said they have n't settled on how the 21 installments would be split , however at least eight will run this summer .
-- " Battlestar Galactica's " final season will likewise be split into two parts , the first of which wraps up on Friday , June 13 at 10:00 /9:00 c .
The 10 remaining episodes will then roll out sometime during the 2008 - 09 season .
-- " Stargate Atlantis " will kick off its fifth season in July , however an exact date has yet to be announced .
" Stargate " portal GateWorld nevertheless points to a July 11 start at 10:00 /9:00 c , noting material posted on the show 's apparent Facebook and MySpace pages . --
And finally , the network 's promo reel from its 2008 - 09 season upfront presentation was distributed to the press .
It showcased its signature dramas ( " Battlestar Galactica , " " Doctor Who , " " Eureka , " " Stargate Atlantis " ) and alternative series ( " Ghost Hunters , " " Ghost Hunters International , " " Destination Truth , " " Scare Tactics , " " Derren Brown , " " ECW " ) as well as its upcoming efforts " Sanctuary , " " Run for Money , " " Warehouse 13 , " " Revolution , " " Caprica , " " Brain Trust " and " The Stranded " not to mention its off - network premiere of " Lost . "
It was when the oil light came on that I started to run through the appropriate next steps in my head ... and realized that there are n't any appropriate next steps when warning lights start going off in a 1982 VW Vanagon camper .
Particularly one converted to run on a mixture of vegetable oil and algae biodiesel grown and refined by a group of Chicago high school students .
As the Sears Tower , our goal , loomed in the distance , a question loomed in my mind :
Was our shared belief in the future of petroleum alternatives and , more importantly , in the fuel processing abilities of public school students and their teachers , strong enough to convince us to push further into the knot of congestion forming around the city ?

The Idea
David Levine , a second - year teacher placed in Chicago through the Teach For America program , faced a common problem : how to get students to take the same interest in their studies as in Grand Theft Auto IV .
His school , the Al Raby School for Community and Environment , serves populations from the predominately African American neighborhoods on Chicago 's West Side , a place where the median income is more than 40 % lower than the city as a whole .
How could he motivate his students to invest their time and interest in the scientific process ?
Levine settled on one of the biggest issues facing this generation of students : the impact , both environmental and political , of our dependence on foreign sources of fuel .
According to the UN Human Development Reports , the US emits 21 % of the world 's carbon dioxide despite having only 4.6 % of the world 's population .
We 're currently engaged in our second war in the oil - rich Middle East .
Using these issues as a starting point , Levine sought a project that would address the problems while at the same time providing an educational and compelling experience for his students .
Thus the Algae Biodiesel Van was born .

The goal was to create enough biodiesel from algae , grown and processed in the classroom , to power a vehicle from the school to Chicago 's Sears Tower and back , an approximately 20 - mile round trip .
Because algae sucks carbon out of the atmosphere , it is relatively carbon neutral to produce and , unlike corn or soybeans , is n't a food crop .
But how do you turn single - celled plants into viable fuel within the confines of a classroom ?
The Process

You can't miss the algae - processing unit that occupies the corner of Levine 's science classroom .
Giant bags filled with a specific strain of fuel - producing algae are stacked on top of one another , connected by a series of tubes that pump the bright green organic slime around a stack of fluorescent lamps to encourage photosynthesis .
This would actually make a great lighting fixture for a trendy LA sushi place .
Students have been working with Levine to cultivate the algae in their classroom and refine it down to fuel .
Almost all the work was done on - site , though at one point the solution had to be taken to a centrifuge at the University of Illinois Chicago for final separation , an event which afforded students a chance to see a fully operational lab .

After spending a large portion of their junior year working through the process , the students were able to create what they hoped was enough fuel to power a vehicle the full distance : one gallon .
Right before the trip one of the students showed off their beaker of algaediesel , which I can attest smells much better than petrodiesel .
Though that 's not saying much .
The Van

Working with a small grant from BP America's A + For Energy program , there was n't much room in the budget for buying a car specifically for the purposes of the test .
Thankfully , the fuel is of such high quality that , when mixed with vegetable oil , it can run on most unmodified diesel engines .
Here 's where the 1982 Vanagon Diesel Westfalia Camper comes into the picture .
Faded orange with a white camper top , this particular Vanagon was loaned to the class for this experiment by a trusting friend of Levine 's family .
Still used for camping , the small fridge inside the van features remnants from previous outings , plus a bed , kitchen and radio ; it 's actually a small home they 're running on their fuel , made all the more so due to the absence of seat belts .

The Fantastic Voyage

After draining off the low - sulfur petrodiesel in the tank , a large crowd of students , faculty and media collected around the van to see if it would actually start .
There was a sense of hopeful expectation as Levine slowly poured a gallon of his student 's labors into the VW .
After taping the plastic back over the fuel tank ( they had trouble getting the cap back on ) , Levine lodged himself in the driver 's seat , while his fellow science teachers piled in to provide moral support and , should the van break down , actual physical support .
Engaging the clutch , a few held their breath has he turned the key .
Put , Put , Put , Put , Put .
The familiar register of a diesel engine filled the air , overtaken immediately by the applause of students .
Levine drove the van around the block and returned victoriously to this group of excited students suddenly filled with that sense of accomplishment that comes from a job well done .
But one more test remained .
Had they made enough good fuel to get the van to the Sears Tower and back ?
In traffic ?

The principal decreed that students could n't ride in the van since it lacked safety belts and , really , anything resembling safety equipment .
Besides , limiting weight was a primary concern :
The range calculations for a single gallon of fuel were fairly rough .
The driving would be handled by James , David 's father and a veteran of the One Lap of America ( he raced a Porsche 911 RS ) .
Navigation was up to Evan , another science teacher involved in the program .
I had the final seat on the back couch where I would serve as the historian and archivist .
After a slight top - off with the remaining fuel mixture and a check of the systems ( assuring the plastic was completely taped over where the gas cap should go ) we set off for the Sears Tower .

Driving into downtown Chicago , especially on a Friday afternoon , requires an ability to improvise .
Construction , traffic and frequent fender benders all lead to the sorts of complex traffic patterns that we do n't currently have the processing power to comprehend .
Thankfully , the Tower is the tallest building in the city and , therefore , was easy to spot out the van 's windows .
Given our limited resources , we decided to tack east using a narrow road that runs predominately underneath the elevated train tracks .
Though not the most direct route , we hoped to avoid congestion and keep track of our chase car , piloted by students and running on good ol ' 89 octane .
The first few minutes out everything was going well .
There was no foul smell or smoke and the engine was running smooth for a van older than the students who fueled it .

That 's when the oil light blinked at us .
Could the fuel be interfering with the engine 's oil pressure or temperature ?
Were we just unlucky enough to be having an unrelated problem while winding our way towards the city 's most recognizable piece of architecture ?
James gets on the phone with David and they quickly decide that it 's unrelated and not a concern .

Pushing forward , we keep spotting the peaks of the Tower between the other building that ring the outer loop .
As we get closer to the city we start getting looks from the commodity traders , receptionists , service employees and others who are hoping to escape the city for the weekend .
Even without the knowledge we 're running on algae , the van is hard to miss .
The oil light still illuminated , we weave our way past cabs and around buses until we see the sign for the Tower 's parking garage .
We 've made it ... halfway at least .
Given the beefed up security downtown , I 'm hoping we do n't get stuck and have to explain why we parked this funny - smelling van right next to the building 's foundation .

James parked the van down the street from the amazing structure , thus lowering the risk of clogging traffic any further and providing a better location for photos .
After a quick picture with two of the students , we raced back across town to the school .
Worried about fuel levels , there was n't time to dawdle .
We cut south before going west , hoping to avoid the worst traffic .
Our gambit worked , and we arrived at the school a few minutes earlier than planned .
So early , in fact , that there was no one around to celebrate our victory over the forces of fuel consumption .
Where the hell were the students ?

It turns out they were inside munching on donated snacks and enthusiastically sharing their research and work on environmental projects they designed as part of the " Green Fair " planned around the launch of the Algae Car .
Inspired by the fuel project , more students than usual actually completed their assignments .
One of the coaches at the school remarked that in high school he just did his assignments to do them , but that Levine 's kids " were actually doing the work because they cared and believed in it . "
Talking with some of the students and teachers , it 's clear that this may be the day 's biggest victory .
Victory And Hope
It 's hard to overestimate either the technical or educational achievement of this project .
While this particular journey back - and - forth from the school to downtown is n't going to fundamentally change our nation 's energy policy , it did impact the very people who will be involved in finding solutions in the future .
The next night I joined a tired but proud Levine for dinner .
In addition to the joy he felt from successfully completing the project , he also had great news about his student 's educational progress .
Advertisement
The students in his classes dramatically improved their scores on the scientific portion of the ACT compared with the previous year .
It is n't easy to quantify the amount that this specific project contributed to the leap in test scores , but it would be hard to deny the impact after seeing his excited students cheer on their project car .

Having driven another special diesel prototype , the Audi R8 V12 TDI LeMans , I can't say that the Vanagon is quite as menacing .
And instead of being flanked by black SUVs driven by off - duty cops , we were followed by an old silver Camry driven by a couple of students .
But if I had to choose which experience I thought was more important , more impressive and more downright awesome I 'd have to go with the Algae Car .
With a significantly smaller budget , a group of determined students and their dedicated teachers proved our options for the future are only limited by our own imagination .
President Bush is discussing a new agreement with Baghdad that would govern the deployment of American troops in Iraq .
With so many Americans adamant about bringing our forces home as soon as possible , a sentiment we strongly share , Mr. Bush must not be allowed to tie the hands of his successor and ensure the country ’s continued involvement in an open - ended war .
Given what ’s at stake in Iraq in terms of American and Iraqi lives lost , national treasure and broad national security interests , the negotiations on any new agreement must be fully transparent  which they are not .
The national debate must be vigorous and thoughtful , and then Congress must vote on whatever deal results .
The White House and the Iraqi government decided in December to pursue the pact as a way to define long - term relations between the two countries , including the legal status of American military forces in Iraq .
The ostensible goal is a more durable political , economic and security relationship than is possible under a United Nations resolution , the current international legal basis for the American military presence in Iraq .
Iraqi officials , increasingly unhappy with restrictions on sovereignty because of the presence of 160,000 foreign troops , have said that they wo n’t extend the United Nations mandate beyond this year .
A Washington - Baghdad deal would have to take its place for the troops to stay .

New data on the ever changing P2P landscape shows that the number of uTorrent users worldwide has more than doubled compared to last year .
The BitTorrent client is most popular in Europe - with an install rate of 11.6 % - and least popular in the United States , where 5.1 % of the PCs have uTorrent installed .
The data presented here are based on a sample of over a million PCs ( Windows only ) , and were gathered by PC Pitstop .
A few months we already reported that uTorrent overtook Azureus ’ position as the most installed BitTorrent application , and this trend continues .
LimeWire ’s popularity on the other hand is declining worldwide .
Nonetheless , it is still by far the most installed filesharing application .
LimeWire going down , uTorrent on the rise
From December 2006 to December 2007 LimeWire lost approximately 25 % of its user base .
By the end of 2007 , 17 % of all PCs in the United States had LimeWire installed , compared to 23.3 % last year .
Similar drops occurred in Europe , Latin America , and the rest of the world .
The most loyal LimeWire users come from Australia , where the install rate is 27 % , only a slight decrease compared to the 30.4 % in 2006 .
The uTorrent user base on the other hand is rapidly growing .
uTorrent installs more than doubled in nearly every part of the world in the last 12 months .
The BitTorrent client is most popular in Europe ( 11.6 % ) , as can be seen from the graph below .
As a result of uTorrent ’s growth , other BitTorrent clients such as Azureus and BitComet are going downhill .
Azureus and BitComet now have an average install rate of 1.4 % and 1.7 % respectively .
Regional Differences
The regional differences in popularity of p2p applications are also worth mentioning .
The data show that uTorrent is far more popular in Europe ( 11.6 % ) than in the United States ( 5.1 % ) .
Limewire on the other hand is well - liked among Aussies ( 27.0 % ) and Canadians ( 27.2 % ) , but has less followers in Latin America .
Emule is still very popular in Latin America , where 16 % of the PCs have the application installed compared to only 1 % in the United States and 3 % in Europe .
Home vs. Business PCs
Unsurprisingly , P2P applications are more frequently installed on home computers versus PCs at the workplace .
Nevertheless , almost one out of five PCs at work ( 18 % ) have at least one P2P application installed .
For home computer this is little over 1 in three ( 36 % )
P2P Market share 2008
We also compiled a pie chart of the market share of the different P2P applications as of January 1st 2008 .
Please note that the data is a bit skewed since most of the data comes from participants who were based in the United States .
LimeWire is without a doubt the winner here .
Finally , we want to make it clear though that install rates do not equal usage .
The fact that someone installed a P2P client does not mean that they actually use it .
Based on the amount of traffic that is generated by each P2P application , uTorrent would be the absolute winner .
Can ' Low - Hanging Fruit ' Be Sexy ?
Two Energy Efficiency Stocks
April 25th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
It is often said that the so - called ‘ low hanging fruit ’ in the energy puzzle is not wind , solar , biomass , geothermal , or any of the other renewable resources .
The cheapest way to create more available energy is to use our current capacity more efficiently .
In other words the ‘ low - hanging fruit ’ is energy efficiency .
I was reminded of this fact recently when I read an interview with the king of all energy geeks , Amory Lovins , at Mother Jones .
Lovins was asked the question , “ If you had $ 1 million to invest in the energy sector , where would you put it ? ”
Lovins responded ,
“ Efficient use .
I want to do the cheapest things first to get the most climate protection and other benefits per dollar .
Buying micropower and “ negawatts ” instead of nuclear gives you about 2 to 11 times more carbon reduction per dollar , and you get it much faster . ”
While not as ‘ sexy ’ as solar and wind , energy efficiency might be the smartest investment play if you ’ve got some cash burning a hole in your pocket ( though that ’s not really the current trend ) .
And while we here at CleanTechnica do not really fancy ourselves to be professional analysts of Jim Cramer or Tom Konrad caliber , we do keep our eyes on emerging trends in the industry .
For that reason it is hard not to pick some favorites .
I ’d like to share two of my favorite energy efficiency plays with you : Echelon ( ELON ) and Beacon Power ( BCON ) .
While I am particularly interested in the technological potential of the two companies ’ products , I also see plenty of room for growth in the energy efficiency sector more broadly
Echelon ( ELON ) markets a suite of network infrastructure products designed for smart - grid applications .
Echelon is poised to take the lead in smart - grid hardware for both small and large - scale applications .
Last year , Echelon signed a deal with McDonald ’s to network its restaurant kitchen equipment and create the “ kitchen of the future , ” which aims to lower energy consumption and increase operational efficiency .

Beacon Power ( BCON ) designs and develops advanced products and services to support stable , reliable and efficient electricity grid operation .
More specifically , Beacon has developed a proprietary flywheel system that allows the storing of grid-energy and the smoothing of fluctuations caused by wind - generated electricity .
Flywheel - based energy storage systems , unlike lead - acid batteries , do not use hazardous materials for production , nor create them during operation .
Unlike batteries , flywheels operate reliably for many years with little or no maintenance .
[ Disclosure : The author holds positions in ELON and BCON .
However , in no way is this an endorsement or recommendation to purchase either of these stocks .
Please thoroughly research any potential investment and always seek the advice of a professional ) .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
June 20 , 2008  -- Few Americans would invite an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service , but that 's exactly what Minnesota pastor Gus Booth wanted when he stood behind his pulpit and told his congregation God wanted them to vote Republican .
In an election where candidates openly discuss their faith and are regularly seen in churches , and a time when pastors ' sermons lead the politics sections of newspapers , one might be excused for not knowing that it is illegal for a church to endorse or oppose a candidate for president .
But when Booth addressed the members of his Warroad Community Church one Sunday in May and told them , " If you are a Christian , you cannot support a candidate like Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton for president , " he very much knew he was violating the law .
He even wrote a letter to the IRS explaining what he had said and challenging the tax collection agency to do something about it .
Churches and other non-profit groups like charities and universities do not have to pay taxes .
That exemption , however , comes with a price .
Churches , and by extension the pastors who serve them in an official capacity , are not allowed to endorse or oppose political candidates .
Booth , 34 , is one of several religious leaders who this year hope to challenge federal law by flouting the regulations about endorsing candidates from the pulpit — a move that could potentially cost them their tax - exempt status , creating financial ruin for many congregations .
The separation of church and state may be one of our democracy 's most vaunted values , but its enforcement falls to one of our government 's most derided institutions — the IRS .
First Amendment Protection ?
Booth and other religious leaders who want to challenge the government believe their rights to freedom of speech and religion , enshrined in the First Amendment , permit them to say whatever they want , wherever they want .
Those rights , they say , should trump a 54 - year - old tax code .
" The government is trying to censor me and other religious leaders , " Booth told ABC News .
" I may be taking on the IRS , but the IRS has taken on the Constitution unchallenged since 1954 .
I feel like the only law that should dictate what I am allowed to say is the First Amendment . "
" The gist of my speech was you can't support Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama because they support abortion and homosexual marriage , and the scripture vehemently opposes both .
I did n't say vote for McCain , but I 'm planning to , " he said .
In addition to being a pastor , Booth is also a delegate to the Republican National Convention .
But it was his Lord and Savior , he says , not his party bosses , who told him to literally make a federal case out of preaching a sermon .
" A month before I made the sermon I talked to the church leadership .
I told them , ' If we do this we could lose our tax exempt status .
Are you prepared for that ?'
We spent a week in prayer , and I felt God was telling me to make that speech . "
Booth said despite alerting the IRS to his sermon , he has yet to hear from the agency .
The IRS would not comment to ABC News on any specific investigation .
Watchdog Group Weighs In
Last week , Americans United for the Separation of Church and State , a watchdog group sent a letter to the IRS also asking them to investigate Booth .
Both the IRS and Americans United say the agency in recent years has increased the number of investigations it conducts on organization suspected of abusing their tax - exempt status and the speed with which it recommends action .
In 2006 , the IRS received 237 complaints and selected 100 groups — 44 churches and 56 nonchurches — for examination .
More than half of those cases remain under investigation , according to IRS statistics .
" However , the IRS did substantiate improper political activity in 26 cases and issued written advisories .
So far , there are no revocation recommendations , " according to an agency report on the statistics .
In 2004 , the IRS selected 110 cases for examination and revoked the tax - exempt status of five organizations .
Of those five organizations , none were churches .
The last church to have its tax - exempt status revoked was the Church at Pierce Creek near Binghamton , N.Y. , in 1992 .
The Church took out an ad in 1992 that read : " The Bible warns us to not follow another man in his sin , nor help him promote sin — lest God chasten us … How then can we vote for Bill Clinton ? "
That ad , like a speech from the pulpit , is a violation of section 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) of the tax code , according to the IRS .
" Generally , the law passed in 1954 prohibits any tax - exempt organization from participating on behalf or in opposition to any candidate , " said IRS spokesperson Nancy Mathis .
Equal Time Behind the Pulpit
Legally , Mathis said , candidates are allowed to speak at churches , much like Sen. Barack Obama , D- Ill. , did over the weekend in Chicago when he delivered a sermon about fatherhood .
Churches who host candidates , however , are supposed to invite the opposition candidate as well .
In 2007 , the IRS investigated and dropped charges against United Church of Christ following a conference in which Obama was allegedly endorsed during an introduction .
Obama formerly belonged to Trinity Church , a member of United Church of Christ , but split with the church following controversial comments by his old pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
" There is a very simple test religious leaders can use to determine if they 're violating the law , " said Rev. Barry Lynn , executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State .
" Ask yourself : ' Is what I 'm doing intended to help someone 's candidacy ? '
If the answer is ' yes , ' do n't do it . "
" Tax exemption is not a right ; it 's a privilege that comes with certain restrictions , " Lynn said .
According to Lynn , Booth 's " free speech " argument is specious because taxpayers should not have to subsidize pastors ' political activities they do not agree with .
Other Pastors Join Booth
Booth is not the only pastor challenging the IRS this year .
The Alliance Defense Fund , a Christian advocacy group based in Scottsdale , Ariz. , is enlisting ministers around the country to endorse candidates from their churches ' pulpits on Sept. 28 .
" Pastors on that day will evaluate candidates in light of scripture , " said Erik Stanley , senior legal counsel for the group .
" Our hope is that the IRS will initiate investigations and we can bring this into the federal courts . "
Churches , he said , are doubly protected by the First Amendment to make political speeches , because it protects both free speech and freedom of religion .
" Churches have constitutional rights and special status by virtue of being churches .
This is n't about political speech , it is about religious speech .
The Bible and scripture applies to every aspect of life , including who we elect . "
Both the Democrats and Republicans recognize how important " faith voters " will be in this year 's presidential election , and each is working to court religious groups .
Given the sensitive legal and political ramifications of the issue , officials from both parties would speak only on background .
" We do n't advise churches because they 're tax exempt organizations .
We do advise our volunteers and coalitions that anything they do related to their religion must be done in their volunteer capacity — not through the church , " said a Republican National Committee official .
The Democrats this year are courting religious voters like never before and will open this summer 's convention , for the first time , with a prayer meeting .
" There is a distinction between the pastor and the pulpit , " said a Democratic Party official .
" We 've made a significant effort to reach out to faith voters this year , but we 're always making sure people know the law and the guidelines . "
Georgia
Tech scientists have developed a new material that , combined with the right process , could become the cheapest way to separate the greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide , out of coal plants ' smokestacks .
" It 's pretty easy and cheap to make and it's got a high capacity for CO2 under realistic conditions , " said Chris Jones , a chemical engineer at Georgia Tech .
Those conditions require a material that can trap CO2 out of a mixture of water vapor , nitrogen , and oxygen ( among other things ) , and then release that carbon dioxide on - demand .
Being able to do that cheaply remains a dream , and one that some say will always remain " vaporware . "
But scientists are pushing on with the effort to develop the right systems to make coal plants outfitted with carbon capture and sequestration cost - competitive with other future power solutions like solar concentrating plants .
Jones ' research appears online in the Journal of the American Chemical Society .
( Update : Link Fixed .
Thanks JMB . )
Two types of materials are seen to have special potential for carbon dioxide separation–zeolites , like Omar Yaghi's ZIFs , and amines .
Jones ' material is the new top - dog in the latter category because it captures CO2 better than other types of amines and can be used more times ( like a longer - lasting sponge ) .
And under real conditions , Jones believes his material could outperform zeolites .
The key challenge is that the material heats up as it traps CO2 , then requires heat to release it .
In order to be cost effective , he said the heat must be captured and then reused .
" Engineering a process that allows you to capture that heat is the key issue in making this process as cheap as possible , " he said .
To create a process , he 's enlisted fellow Georgia Tech researcher , Bill Koros , to design a new type of so - called filtering bed , which they hope will solve the heat transfer problem .
As we 've noted in the past , well - meaning people disagree on whether supporting any sort of coal burning makes sense , but there are two reasons to support carbon capture and sequestration , or the separation and geological burying of carbon dioxide :
One , with China building two plants a week and a 1000 coal plants already online here in the US , we need a solution that can be " bolted - on " to existing plants , which are n't going to disappear the minute that RE < C .
As Jones put it , " If you want to make an impact , you want to be able to develop something that can target the old dirty coal plants . "
Two , biomass burning + sequestration could be a way to actually pull historical CO2 out of the atmosphere .
I do , now , have new reservations about biomass , though .
Ausra CEO , Bob Fishman , almost had me convinced that biomass was a bad idea .
He maintains that you have to grow all the feedstock for the plant ultralocally ( like within 50 miles of the plant ) to keep the plant environmentally net positive .
( And I 'm ducking the general biofuel debate that is now raging . )

In a statement , Mrs. Clinton described General Petraeus as “ an able and respected leader in Iraq under incredibly difficult circumstances , ” and said she looked forward to hearing “ how he will meet these important challenges ” of the broader Central Command region .
Mr. McCain , at a news conference on Wednesday , said General Odierno “ is maybe not perfect , but I think he has done a magnificent job . ”
Referring to General Petraeus , Mr. McCain said , “ I think he is by far the best - qualified individual to take that job ” as the regional commander .
After three tours in Iraq , General Petraeus , 55 , has become perhaps the best - known military officer of his generation , and it had been expected that his next assignment after Iraq would be as the top American commander in Europe .
Chosen instead to take charge of a region that includes Pakistan and Iran , as well as Iraq and Afghanistan , General Petraeus issued a statement on Wednesday saying , “ I am honored to be nominated for this position and to have an opportunity to continue to serve . ”
General Petraeus and General Odierno have built a strong working relationship and are believed to see eye to eye on how to carry out the complicated Iraq mission  one they believe requires offensive military operations , more subtle counterinsurgency missions and society - wide reconstruction , all at once .
Mr. Gates said General Odierno was the logical choice to succeed his old boss because he was familiar to the officers and troops in Iraq and , not least , to the Iraqis .
“ In most parts of the world , especially the Middle East , personal relationships make a big difference , ” Mr. Gates said .
The defense secretary also announced that Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli , Mr. Gates ’s senior military assistant , would be nominated for Army vice chief of staff , a post that General Odierno had been expected to take .
General Chiarelli has had two tours in Iraq  first as commander of the First Cavalry Division and coalition forces in Baghdad , and then as the No. 2 commander in the country .
The Central Command position would be General Petraeus ’s fourth tour in the region since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
He first served as commander of the 101st Airborne Division , which invaded Iraq from the south and set up an area of control across the north .
But parts of the north , in particular the city of Mosul , are now among the most unstable in the nation .

Livingstone interview Mayor of London Ken Livingstone has dismissed claims that revelations that he has five children by three different women will affect his mayoral campaign .
Talking to BBC London , he insisted voters had never taken an interest in his private life .
As well as two young children by his partner Emma Beale , he has two older daughters by one woman and a boy with another .
But Mr Livingstone conceded the issue would be used to attack him .
The revelation comes a month before he faces the capital 's voters in seeking re-election .
Responding to a question that some people might be shocked by the revelation , he said : " Clearly , I do n't think anybody in this city is shocked about what consenting adults do .
No one has ever found anything in my private life that was illegal or immoral
Ken Livingstone
" As long as you do n't involve children , animals and vegetables they leave people to get on and live their own life in their own way . "
He added : " If I had secrets that my family or my close friends did n't know about then that would be a different matter .
" But there 's a difference between private and secret and I think the media 's got to understand that . "
Mr Livingstone said journalists had been " looking into my private life for 40 years " .
" We 've had occasions where they have broken into my bank account which is a criminal offence .
" No one has ever found anything in my private life that was illegal or immoral . "
He said that as a councillor , MP and mayor he had " canvassed tens of thousands of people " .
" On occasion people ask how the kids are and on a one - to - one I 'm happy to talk about that but with the media I 'm not .
" My private life is n't my sole property .
It 's been shared with other people and they expect it to stay private and it 's going to stay private . "

What are these ?
oEmbed
o Embed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites .
The simple API allows a website to display embedded content ( such as photos or videos ) when a user posts a link to that resource , without having to parse the resource directly .
This document is stored on GitHub .
Table Of Contents
1. Quick Example
A consumer ( e.g. WordPress ) makes the following HTTP request :
http://www.flickr.com/services/oembed/?format=json&url=http%3A//www.flickr.com/photos/bees/2341623661/
The provider ( e.g. Flickr ) then responds with an oEmbed response :
{ " version " : " 1.0 " , " type " : " photo " , " width " : 240 , " height " : 160 , " title " : " ZB 8T0193 " , " url " : " http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3123/2341623661_7c99f48bbf_m.jpg " , " author_name " : " Bees " , " author_url " : " http://www.flickr.com/photos/bees/ " , " provider_name " : " Flickr " , " provider_url " : " http://www.flickr.com/ "
}
This allows the consumer to turn a URL to a Flickr photo page into structured data to allow embedding of that photo in the consumer 's website .
2. Full Spec
This spec is broken into three parts - configuration , the consumer request and the provider response .
An oEmbed exchange occurs between a consumer and a provider .
A consumer wishes to show an embedded representation of a third party resource on their own web site , such as a photo or an embedded video .
A provider implements the oEmbed API to allow consumers to fetch that representation .
2.1. Configuration
Configuration for oEmbed is very simple .
Providers must specify one or more URL scheme and API endpoint pairs .
The URL scheme describes which URLs provided by the service may have an embedded representation .
The API endpoint describes where the consumer may request representations for those URLs .
For instance :
URL scheme : http://www.flickr.com/photos/*
API endpoint : http://www.flickr.com/services/oembed/
The URL scheme may contain one or more wildcards ( specified with an asterisk ) .
Wildcards may be present in the domain portion of the URL , or in the path .
Within the domain portion , wildcards may only be used for subdomains .
Wildcards may not be used in the scheme ( to support HTTP and HTTPS , provide two url / endpoint pairs ) .
Some examples :
http://www.flickr.com/photos/*
OK
OK http://www.flickr.com/photos/*/foo/
OK
OK http://*.flickr.com/photos/*
OK
OK http://*.com/photos/*
NOT OK
NOT OK *://www.flickr.com/photos/*
NOT OK
The API endpoint must point to a URL with either HTTP or HTTPS scheme which implements the API described below .
2.2 . Consumer Request
Requests sent to the API endpoint must be HTTP GET requests , with all arguments sent as query parameters .
All arguments must be urlencoded ( as per RFC 1738 ) .
The following query parameters are defined as part of the spec :
url ( required )
The URL to retrieve embedding information for .
maxwidth ( optional )
The maximum width of the embedded resource .
Only applies to some resource types ( as specified below ) .
For supported resource types , this parameter must be respected by providers .
maxheight ( optional )
The maximum height of the embedded resource .
Only applies to some resource types ( as specified below ) .
For supported resource types , this parameter must be respected by providers .
format ( optional )
The required response format .
When not specified , the provider can return any valid response format .
When specified , the provider must return data in the request format , else return an error ( see below for error codes ) .
Providers should ignore all other arguments it does n't expect .
Providers are welcome to support custom additional parameters .
Some examples :
http://flickr.com/services/oembed?url=http%3A//flickr.com/photos/bees/2362225867/
http://flickr.com/services/oembed?url=http%3A//flickr.com/photos/bees/2362225867/&maxwidth=300&maxheight=400&format=json
Note : Providers may choose to have the format specified as part of the endpoint URL itself , rather than as a query string parameter .
For instance :
URL scheme : http://www.flickr.com/photos/*
API XML endpoint : http://www.flickr.com/services/oembed.xml
API JSON endpoint : http://www.flickr.com/services/oembed.json
In this case , the format parameter is not needed and will be ignored .
When a provider publishes a URL scheme and API endpoint pair , they should clearly state whether the format is implicit in the endpoint or if it needs to be passed as an argument .
2.3 . Provider Response
The response returned by the provider can be in either JSON or XML .
Each format specifies a way of encoding name - value pairs which comprise the response data .
Each format has an associated mime - type which must be returned in the Content - type header along with the response .
2.3.1 . JSON response
JSON responses must contain well formed JSON and must use the mime - type of application / json .
The JSON response format may be requested by the consumer by specifying a format of json .
For example :
{ " foo " : " bar " , " baz " : 1 }
The key - value pairs to be returned are specified below .
All text must be UTF - 8 encoded .
2.3.2. XML response
XML responses must use the mime - type of text / xml .
The XML response format may be requested by the consumer by specifying a format of xml .
The response body must contain well formed XML with a root element called oembed and child elements for each key containing the value within the element body .
For example :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " standalone = " yes " ?> < oembed > < foo> bar</ foo > < baz>1</baz > </oembed >
The key - value pairs to be returned are specified below .
All text must be UTF - 8 encoded .
Values should be escaped PCDATA .
For example :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " standalone = " yes " ?> < oembed > < html ><b> awesome!</b></html> </oembed >
2.3.4 . Response parameters
Responses can specify a resource type , such as photo or video .
Each type has specific parameters associated with it .
The following response parameters are valid for all response types :
type ( required )
The resource type .
Valid values , along with value - specific parameters , are described below .
version ( required )
The oEmbed version number .
This must be 1.0 . title ( optional )
A text title , describing the resource .
author_name ( optional )
The name of the author / owner of the resource .
author_url ( optional ) A URL for the author / owner of the resource .
provider_name ( optional )
The name of the resource provider .
provider_url ( optional )
The url of the resource provider .
cache_age ( optional )
The suggested cache lifetime for this resource , in seconds .
Consumers may choose to use this value or not .
thumbnail_url ( optional ) A URL to a thumbnail image representing the resource .
The thumbnail must respect any maxwidth and maxheight parameters .
If this parameter is present , thumbnail_width and thumbnail_height must also be present .
thumbnail_width ( optional )
The width of the optional thumbnail .
If this parameter is present , thumbnail_url and thumbnail_height must also be present .
thumbnail_height ( optional )
The height of the optional thumbnail .
If this parameter is present , thumbnail_url and thumbnail_width must also be present .
Providers may optionally include any parameters not specified in this document ( so long as they use the same key - value format ) and consumers may choose to ignore these .
Consumers must ignore parameters they do not understand .
2.3.4.1 .
The photo type
This type is used for representing static photos .
The following parameters are defined :
url ( required )
The source URL of the image .
Consumers should be able to insert this URL into an < img > element .
Only HTTP and HTTPS URLs are valid .
width ( required )
The width in pixels of the image specified in the url parameter .
height ( required )
The height in pixels of the image specified in the url parameter .
Responses of this type must obey the maxwidth and maxheight request parameters .
2.3.4.2 .
The video type
This type is used for representing playable videos .
The following parameters are defined :
html ( required )
The HTML required to embed a video player .
The HTML should have no padding or margins .
Consumers may wish to load the HTML in an off - domain iframe to avoid XSS vulnerabilities .
width ( required )
The width in pixels required to display the HTML .
height ( required )
The height in pixels required to display the HTML .
Responses of this type must obey the maxwidth and maxheight request parameters .
If a provider wishes the consumer to just provide a thumbnail , rather than an embeddable player , they should instead return a photo response type .
2.3.4.3 .
The link type
Responses of this type allow a provider to return any generic embed data ( such as title and author_name ) , without providing either the url or html parameters .
The consumer may then link to the resource , using the URL specified in the original request .
2.3.4.4 .
The rich type
This type is used for rich HTML content that does not fall under one of the other categories .
The following parameters are defined :
html ( required )
The HTML required to display the resource .
The HTML should have no padding or margins .
Consumers may wish to load the HTML in an off - domain iframe to avoid XSS vulnerabilities .
The markup should be valid XHTML 1.0 Basic. width ( required )
The width in pixels required to display the HTML .
height ( required )
The height in pixels required to display the HTML .
Responses of this type must obey the maxwidth and maxheight request parameters .
2.3.5 . Errors
Providers should return any error conditions as HTTP status codes .
The following status codes are defined as part of the oEmbed specification :
404 Not Found
The provider has no response for the requested url parameter .
This allows providers to be broad in their URL scheme , and then determine at call time if they have a representation to return .
501 Not Implemented
The provider cannot return a response in the requested format .
This should be sent when ( for example ) the request includes format=xml and the provider does n't support XML responses .
However , providers are encouraged to support both JSON and XML .
401 Unauthorized
The specified URL contains a private ( non-public ) resource .
The consumer should provide a link directly to the resource instead of embedding any extra information , and rely on the provider to provide access control .
3. Security considerations
When a consumer displays any URLs , they will probably want to filter the URL scheme to be one of http , https or mailto , although providers are free to specify any valid URL .
Without filtering , Javascript : ... style URLs could be used for XSS attacks .
When a consumer displays HTML ( as with video embeds ) , there 's a vector for XSS attacks from the provider .
To avoid this , it is recommended that consumers display the HTML in an iframe , hosted from another domain .
This ensures that the HTML cannot access cookies from the consumer domain .
4. Discovery
o Embed providers can choose to make their oEmbed support discoverable by adding < link > elements to the head of their existing ( X) HTML documents or by setting Link headers .
Element example :
< link rel= " alternate " type= " application / json+oembed " href = " http://flickr.com/services/oembed?url=http%3A%2F%2Fflickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fbees%2F2362225867%2F&format=json " title= " Bacon Lollys o Embed Profile " /> < link rel=" alternate " type = " text / xml+oembed " href = " http://flickr.com/services/oembed?url=http%3A%2F%2Fflickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fbees%2F2362225867%2F&format=xml " title= " Bacon Lollys o Embed Profile " />
Header example :
Link : < http://flickr.com/services/oembed?url=http%3A%2F%2Fflickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fbees%2F2362225867%2F&format=json>; rel= " alternate " ; type=" application /json+oembed " ; title= " Bacon Lollys oEmbed Profile " Link : < http://flickr.com/services/oembed?url=http%3A%2F%2Fflickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fbees%2F2362225867%2F&format=xml>; rel= " alternate " ; type = " text / xml+oembed " ; title= " Bacon Lollys oEmbed Profile "
The URLs contained within the href attribute or uri-reference within angle brackets should be the full oEmbed endpoint plus URL and any needed format parameter .
No other request parameters should be included in this URL .
The type attribute must contain either application / json+oembed for JSON responses , or text / xml+oembed for XML .

Worldwide pro-Tibet protests have sparked an upsurge of wounded national pride in China – and now a flood of patriotic T - shirts as the country 's new capitalists seize the moment .
Droves of clothes makers in China are selling T - shirts proclaiming Beijing 's sovereignty over Tibet and denouncing Western targets .
" Go China ! " is written in Chinese across one T - shirt sold on the popular retail website Taobao.com .
In less - than - perfect English , the back adds : " Anti-riot & explore the truth . "

Slogan : Chinese characters proclaim ' Go China ! ' over a map and linked hands
" Tibet WAS , IS and ALWAYS will be a party of China ! " declares another T - shirt shown on a state - run Shanghai news website Eastday.com .
One seller on the Taobao.com website urged citizens to buy the patriotic designs to wear when then Olympic torch passes through China in coming weeks .
" I hope that all compatriots in the country will use their bodies to show support for the Olympic Games and opposition to Tibetan independence , " the retailer said .
Businesses tapping into China 's patriotic upsurge can expect orders at least until the Games this summer .

Wounded heart : T - shirts proclaim Chinese pride in the face of pro-Tibet protests
" Recently many people have been enquiring about making patriotic merchandise , asking for patriotic hats , T - shirts and even scarves , " the Shanghai report said .
The T - shirts are selling on - line for between about 18 and 30 yuan ( £ 1.30 to £ 2.15 ) , and some merchants said they were selling them at or near cost to show their own patriotism .
Demonstrations in recent days have urged a boycott of the French retail giant Carrefour after high - profile pro-Tibet protests in Paris earlier this month .
Others have denounced U.S. television news channel CNN after a commentator said China was ruled by " goons and thugs . "
" Shut up CNN ! , " declares one T - shirt now on sale .
Academics at the UK's Nottingham University were arrested as terrorists for downloading Al Qaeda documents from a US government server in the course of research into a Master 's degree convering terrorist tactics .
The two UK - born profs were released , but the student faces deportation to Algeria under the Terrorism Act , where he believes he will be tortured .
The university — which encouraged its staffers to rat out people they thought were involved in researching terrorism — refuses to acknowledge that anything is wrong with any of this .
Despite his Nottingham University supervisors insisting the materials were directly relevant to his research , Rizwaan Sabir , 22 , was held for nearly a week under the Terrorism Act , accused of downloading the materials for illegal use .
The student had obtained a copy of the al - Qaida training manual from a US government website for his research into terrorist tactics .
The case highlights what lecturers are claiming is a direct assault on academic freedom led by the government which , in its attempt to establish a " prevent agenda " against terrorist activity , is putting pressure on academics to become police informers .
Sabir was arrested on May 14 after the document was found by a university staff member on an administrator 's computer .
The administrator , Hisham Yezza , an acquaintance of Sabir , had been asked by the student to print the 1,500 - page document because Sabir could not afford the printing fees .
The pair were arrested under the Terrorism Act , Sabir 's family home was searched and their computer and mobile phones seized .
They were released uncharged six days later but Yezza , who is Algerian , was immediately rearrested on unrelated immigration charges and now faces deportation .
I 've never been so thoroughly disappointed with a gadget than I am with the Scrubbing Bubbles Automatic Shower Cleaner .
You might have seen one of these in the aisles of Target or Wal - Mart and thought it would be an amazing way to keep your shower clean .
After all , the Ad copy says , " It 's like a MAID .
Times TWO ! "
You'd be dreaming of two hot robot french maid androids , keeping your human cleaning receptacles spotless .
But this stuff does not work .
DO NOT BUY .
UPDATE : Just got hate mail for this post .
Sounds like a douchebag rep for the product shilling hard .

You hang the device on your shower head .
The included proprietary cleaner bottles gravity - feed into the rotating nozzle and pump , powered by 4 AA batteries .
You push a button after you 're done showering and after half a minute of warning beeps , the turret fires off the cleaning fluid in a 360 - degree pattern .
It 's supposed to be a robotic anti shower dirt artillery cannon .
It is is not .
Over a few weeks , a mild and inexcusable pattern of soap scum ( infantry in the army of shower gunk ) built up onto my bathtub .
Was it by chance some serious buildup ?
No .
Some strong stuff in the purple squirt bottle applied and a non abrasive sponge took it right off .

Honestly , I think they 're selling this thing on the fantasy of clean bathrooms and fear of mildew alone .
The snake oil product , which I tested for about two months , might make a good base for an automated scarecrow weapon in the garden triggered by some motion sensor .
But it wo n't do anything for your bathtub that a sponge , some elbow grease and the most caustic material your lungs and skin can handle can't do better and cheaper .
Especially the original Scrubbing Bubbles stuff , which I am a fan of .
Robot bathroom cleaner , zero ; human domestic man servant , 1 .
UPDATE : Just got this hate mail from this guy , josh.pruitt@gmail.com
This is clearly an angry attack on a product .
Lots of people I know
( self included ) use this product and have been satisfied with its
performance for years .
The article is completely biased and shows a
lack of research .
There 's no indication that Brian contacted Arm &
Hammer for help with finding out why the product was n't performing as
expected .
Just because a product does n't work for you does n't mean
it 's " snake oil . "
This product is n't even related to the theme of
Gizmodo .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
" Hello Arm and Hammer , your thingy I bought does n't work .
Can you please explain why ?
Oh , ok .
Good answer .
Thanks .
Bye . " * goes back to using lame shower cleaner with a deeper understanding of why it fucking sucks .*
As the Colorado Senate campaign starts to hot up , GOP hopeful Bobblehead Shaffer has launched a new TV ad telling us how he ’s the change Colorado needs .
It ’s a pretty spot , which features this scenic shot of Mt. McKinley towering majestically over … ummm , hold the phone …
Sweet fancy Jesus , does this braying jackass even know what state he lives in ?
The staff at The Onion are probably sitting around right now wondering how they ’re going to top this one .
We need a change , all right .
Specifically , we need to change to a candidate who can find Colorado on a map .
Meanwhile , Alaska , you ’re welcome to him .
UPDATE : Anchorage mayor Mark Begich , himself a US Senate candidate , responds here :
“ While Alaskans can understand why Bob Schaffer would promote our beautiful mountain , I hope he doesnâ€™t expect Alaska to cede North Americaâ€™s highest peak to the State of Colorado . ”
Tell you what – we ’ll trade you Colorado Springs for it .
UPDATE 2 : The ad has , not surprisingly , been removed from YouTube .
Thanks to Larry Huynh , Politics West , Mark Liddell and Weldon Kennedy .
The “ Design Patterns ” book is one of the worst programming books ever .
Yes , really .
I ’m 100 % dead serious when I say that I think it has set ( and will continue to set ) the progress of software development back by decades .
Why ?!
Let me offer up a parable ; I will call it “ The Plank . ”
The Plank
Back when I took computer science , as part of the curriculum was a compulsory class in statistics .
Two of my closest friends ( Olle and Martin ) and I scoffed at this statistics class — we were computer scientists for chrissake , we do n’t care about statistics ! — and kept postponing the class year after year , until we basically had to take it in order to graduate .
Still , we resisted up to the very last minute .
Sure , we went to a few lectures , but did n’t pay attention , did n’t do any exercises , or anything .
We sort of were planning to postpone it another year , because … duh… statistics !
Except , the Friday before the Monday of the exam , Olle ( I think ) really insisted we should take the exam and get rid of this horrible thing once and for all .
His brilliant idea : just cram all weekend and do the exam on Monday !
Reluctantly we all agreed the time had come and it was the right thing to do .
The plan of attack that we devised was to go through the exams of the last several years , look at every question that was asked and see if we could identify questions or question categories that recurred , and learn enough categories that we ’d get a passing grade on the course .
I do n’t recall the details , but let ’s say that the typical exam had 10 questions , worth 5 points each , and you needed 25 points for a passing grade ( 50 % ) and 38 points for passing with honors ( 75 % ) .
Thus , we needed to learn 5 categories and ace the questions to pass .
To err on the side of caution , I think we identified 8 question categories from combing through the old exams ( which you generally do get access to in Sweden ) for several hours .
We then sat down , split the question categories amongst us , and each studied only the text book chapters relevant to our own categories .
After cramming the chapters enough that we could solve questions from that category , we taught each other what we had learned , and the steps to solving these questions .
One trick we devised was to create our own stereotypical problem for each problem category , and we pretty much memorized its solution as a means to remember how to solve problems in that category .
I only vaguely recall one particular stereotypical problem that we had named “ The Plank ” because it involved sawing a wooden plank in two and somehow looking at the distribution of the lengths of the two resulting pieces .
We spent Friday evening and all of Saturday and Sunday doing this .
Sunday ,
Olle brought along caffeine pills as an extra study aid .
Everything to give us the edge in defeating the statistics beast !
Monday morning as we gathered outside the exam room , Olle looked like a man possessed .
He had stayed up all night , popping caffeine pills like they were peanuts .
“ I feel good about this , ” he said as we entered the room .
Finally , sitting down with the dreaded statistics exam in front of me , I dove right in quickly trying to solve as many problems as possible with the limited statistics knowledge I had crammed into my head before it evaporated !
To this day I vividly recall looking at one of the questions of the exam , thinking “ Yes ! Score !
It ’s The Plank ! ” and furiously scribbled down the solution I had memorized , but applied to this incarnation of the problem .
Six long hours later the exam was over and the three of us met outside .
“ I think I aced it , ” Olle exclaimed .
Martin and I were n’t quite as confident .
Two weeks or so later , we finally got the results .
Olle did n’t quite ace it , but he did get over 75 % , passing with honors .
So did Martin .
I was 3 or 4 points shy of the 75 % limit , only getting a passable grade .
Looking over my answers I soon found out why .
I had a zero on The Plank question !
Reading the question again , suddenly it was clear to me : it was n’t The Plank , it just superficially looked like The Plank !
It was also painfully clear to me that had I paused and thought about the problem for a while , I would not only have realized this , but I would also have nailed the question , because I knew how to solve it !
If you did n’t guess it already , The Plank is a design pattern .
In this case , I had focused so heavily on the design patterns we had identified that I was seeing solutions before I was seeing the problem !
I would have done much better not learning any of the patterns in the first place , just relying on the skills I had obtained through study , which got me through all the other questions .
Stay away from the box , or I ’ll smack your head with the plank
How does that story relate , you ask ?
I ’ll tell you .
What the Design Patterns book teaches is for people to think in the box instead of outside of it ; just as I did on that exam .
Pattern thinking has now permeated and perverted peoples ’ thinking to the extent where patterns are perceived as being an ends ; something you need to use to correctly solve problems .
Such thinking , whether intended or not is , of course , utter nonsense .
Worse , it ’s pure poison to the malleable brain of a young programmer !
Thinking in patterns is exactly the wrong thing to do !
It makes you think in terms of the solution instead of in terms of the problem !
Pattern thinking makes you try to fit a round , square , or oval hole ( your choice of patterns ) to the triangular peg ( your problem ) .
When all you have is a hammer …
As if spreading poisonous mind rot was n’t enough , the other outrageous thing about the Book From Hell is that it took stuff that had been known forever in computer science circles and renamed things we already knew by some other name ( or indeed no name at all , because it ’s blatantly obvious ) .
For example , before dumb and dumber decided to call it the “ visitor pattern ” every programmer worth his salt would just call it a “ map ” operation ( as in the LISP functions “ map ” , “ mapcar ” , “ maplist ” , etc ) .
That ’s just , oh , something like 1994 - 1960 ( ? ) = 34 years of previously established terminology !
Twits .
Peter Norvig has a more reasoned presentation on why design patterns are completely not needed if you use a reasonably modern programming language ( instead of tripe like C++ and Java ) .
Design patterns ?
Just say no !
In this post I 'll look at the Acquasol project and then more generally at water scarcity worldwide and some of the approaches being taken to tackle it .
I talked about one of these - Wizard Power 's technique for storing energy using ammonia - last week .
The other project is by a company called Acquasol which is building a plant to desalinate water using solar thermal energy at Point Paterson , near Port Augusta in South Australia .
There were a couple of small Australian solar power projects that I left out of my look at solar thermal power a little while ago , as I thought they were worthy of separate consideration .
Acquasol
Port Augusta is a particularly suitable location for producing water via desalination , given its increasingly arid climate and remoteness from fresh water sources .
Using solar energy to drive the desalination process is efficient for a number of reasons .
Firstly , South Australia is an importer of electricity and suffers occasional supply shortages in summer when the interconnectors to the national grid reach their limits .
Secondly , producing water locally saves the energy currently used to pump water several hundred kilometres from the east of South Australia , where the increasingly scarce water is located .
South Australia also has excellent solar insolation , and the location chosen is close to existing power lines ( for the Northern and Playford brown coal - fired power stations nearby ) , water pipelines and salt pans for solar brine harvesting .
This minimises a lot of the infrastructure costs and also enables a drawback of desalination plants ( the environmental impact of discharging briny water back into the sea ) into a potential positive , as it can be used to feed a salt production process instead .
The Acquasol plant will be producing water using a desalination process known as " multi effects " , driven by 1.75 - kilometer square concentrating parabolic trough mirror field .
The desalination plant , solar thermal storage ( apparently using molten salt , but this is n't clear ) and other operating equipment will be sited in a small area adjacent to the solar field .
Multi-effects evaporates salt water using a vacuum and recondenses the vapor into drinking water .
Both require energy , usually between 2.7-4.5 kilowatthours per kilolitre ( though improvements to the technology are expected to lower this figure - hopefully to around .7 kilowatthours per kilolitre ) .
At present , pumping Murray River water to the Upper Spencer Gulf consumes up to five kilowatthours per kilolitre .
Multi-effects deslination can also use heat as an energy input , skipping the initial conversion into electricity and increasing efficiency .
The company expects that by having reverse osmosis desalination and multi-effects desalination operate side - by - side in future , powered by solar energy and incorporating thermal energy storage and a backup gas turbine backup , further operational efficiencies can be reaped that lower costs .
The water produced could also be in demand from large water users inland , like BHP 's Olympic Dam mine , which currently draws around 30 megalitres of water per day from the Great Artesian Basin , and will need another 120 megalitres per day to service the expansion of the mine .
BHP are currently proposing to build another desalination plant at Port Bonython near Whyalla , though this is being resisted for a number of reasons , one being a vulnerable local population of giant cuttlefish .
Another Australian experiment with desalination using solar thermal power is being performed by RMIT at Pyramid Hill in Victoria - this seems to be completely independent of the Acquasol project .
The Trouble With Water
Australia 's troubles with water are well known by now , thanks to our recent bout of intense drought and the impact this has had on agricultural production and subsequently on a number of global commodity prices - rice being the most recent example .
The United States has also started to experience issues with water supplies in both the south east and south western states .
Access to fresh , clean water has increasingly become an issue worldwide in recent years , as a number of factors come into play affecting both supply and demand :
* Population is increasing - and most rapidly in drier regions
* People have become wealthier and accustomed to using more water
* Polluted water has become more common , as large swathes of the developing world industrialise
* Ever increasing demand for power ( and newer forms of energy like biofuels or coal to liquids plants )
* Groundwater aquifers have been depleted by irrigation for agriculture
* The water industry is mostly made up of public utilities that have often been starved of new investment funds
* Climate change has impacted rain patterns , reducing rainfall levels and increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts
* Melting glaciers have reduced water flows
* Water has been cheap , so there is little incentive to conserve it
These issues have combined to make water a sensitive security issue in some regions , with some experts predicting resource wars over water , with obvious parallels to conflict over dwindling fossil fuel supplies ( though thankfully water is n't actually depleting - it is more of a quality and availability issue ) .
Desalination Plants In Australia and Worldwide
In recent years a rash of desalination plants have been proposed for Australian capital cities to meet increasing demand for water and to insure against drought induced supply constraints .
* Perth led the way , with one plant already completed at Kwinana and another under construction at Binningup .
* Brisbane has built one plant at Tugun and is consider more at sites including Marcoola , Kawana and Bribie Island .
* Adelaide is building a plant at Port Stanvac
* Melbourne is building a plant at Wonthaggi , which is receiving a lot of criticism
* Sydney has commenced construction of a desalination plant at Kurnell , which has also been the subject of a lot of controversy .
Much of the criticism of desalination plants centres around their key drawbacks - they use large amounts of power ( ex - NSW Premier Bob Carr used to refer to water from desalination plants as " bottled electricity " ) and they can have a large impact on the local environment , with danger to wildlife from the inlet valves and from the brine that is pumped back out .
The Acquasol venture stacks up quite against other plants well based on these concerns , as it uses locally produced renewable energy , does n't emit brine and apparently has little local wildlife to contend with .
Another criticism of desalination plants is the high cost of building them , with water recycling , fixing leaking pipes in the water system and encouraging local rainwater capture ( via rainwater tanks ) often being deemed more cost effective and lower impact ways of providing more fresh water .
Nevertheless , construction of desalination plants has accelerated elsewhere around the globe as well , with prominent examples in Tampa Bay , Saudi Arabia , Abu Dhabi , Israel and Spain .
Desalination Techniques
The multi-effects desalination technique used by Acquasol is just one of a number being put into practice .
The other major mechanism is known as reverse osmosis , which is used for around 47 % of installed capacity worldwide ( vs 36 % for multi effects ) .
A promising new technology that is being researched is the use of carbon nanotube based membranes developed by researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , which they claim could reduce the cost of desalination by 75 percent compared to reverse osmosis methods .
Last year 's " AlwaysOn Going Green 100 " listed 19 companies concentrating on water , which demonstrates the level of interest in this area in the cleantech industry - though Neal Dikeman has cautioned investors that water is always the problem of the future .
Inventor Dean Kamen is another entrant in this area , promoting a relatively inexpensive small scale water purification unit which looks promising .
A similar , but much more expensive , device is the solar cube .
Another interesting technique for desalination is the OTEC power generation process , which was discussed previously in my post on ocean energy .
Salt Power - The Power Of Osmosis
On a tangential note , there is an obscure alternative energy generation process known as " pressure retarded osmosis " , which captures the energy that is released when salt and fresh water mix .
While this seems a far - fetched way of generating power ( and I 'm not trying to encourage any perpetual motion schemes involving desalination plants coupled with osmosis based power generation ) , there are efforts underway to explore the possibility of generating power in regions where large volumes of fresh water meet the sea .
The science behind these projects is based on the phenomenon that when salt and fresh water mix , they are typically warmed by 0.1 degree Celsius .
Some Dutch scientists claim the total amount of energy generated at all the world 's estuaries is equivalent to 20 percent of world electricity demand .
One trial is being undertaken at a fjord south of Oslo by Statkraft , the other at a seaside lake in Holland by the Dutch Centre for Sustainable Water Technology .
Both schemes depend on membranes placed between the salt and fresh water - however the membranes are both expensive and energy intensive to produce , which means that power generation is not even close to being economical .
The membranes are , however , similar to those used in desalination plants that use the reverse osmosis effect - the market for which is growing at around 15 % per year .
General Electric is one of the major manufacturers and has an " aspirational goal " of producing fresh water from salt through membranes at a cost of 10 cents per cubic metre , with the hope of a new market emerging for power generating membranes a decade from now .
Modelling The Future
Returning to the original subject of Acquasol , one of the ( non executive ) directors of the company is Stephen Schneider from Stanford University - one of the contributors to the climate science blog Real Climate .
Schneider has an interesting column up at Edge magazine , which considers ( amongst other things ) the difficulties in modelling complex systems and overcoming political obstacles when dealing with environmental issues .
While many of the remarks are aimed at climate science , I think a lot of them also apply to the issue of modelling and dealing with peak oil .
The quote below is just a selection - I recommend reading all of it
I divide my life pretty much in thirds .
One third is education , outreach , teaching , media , talking to Congress , parliaments , premiers , etc. and trying to get people — governments especially — to see this problem as it is and not as it's typically portrayed in the media , which tends to focus on the two extreme , lowest probability outcomes : 1 . global warming is the end of the world or 2 . global warming is good for you .
The second third of my time is spent trying to understand the science .
When I talk about the science , I do n't just mean answering questions like " how many degrees does the earth warm if you double CO2 ? "
That 's a very strict bio-geophysical question .
I also want to know what happens to the water supply systems of the world if the planet warms by X amount ?
What would it mean to agricultural productivity , or to sea level , to the intensity of storms and how they impact people ?
I consider the study of the impacts of climate change just as much a science as predicting how much it will change .
The final third of my professional life — which involves value judgments as much as scientific and technological assessments — is spent asking the question : " What do we do about it ? "
That is , of course , a very difficult question because it involves inventing our way out of the problem on the one hand , but not waiting 20 to 50 years to do that on the other .
What is the sequencing of the so - called low - hanging fruit ?
The first step is performance standards for refrigerators , air conditioners , automobiles , machines and housing efficiency .
That gives you a very fast payback .
Second step : public - private partnerships where we try to get the private sector to invest in the development and deployment of renewable and other low - carbon - emitting alternatives .
They have return on investment criteria that are often too stringent to get a lot of the billions of dollars that need to flow into development , so we will need some federal , or state , and city financial pump priming , along with the bigger private foundations .
Third step : you can't keep dumping your tail - pipe waste and your smokestack waste and changing the land surface — all modifying the atmosphere — for free , as if it 's an unpriced sewer .
Sooner or later there has to be a shadow price on carbon .
Whether it's a tax , a cap and trade system — somehow you have to make the polluter pay , and we have to take a look at the efficiency and effectiveness of those techniques .
But there 's a component in this evaluation that I pay particular attention to that most of the economists do not .
That is , if we increase the price of doing business by including a tail - pipe charge for our messing up the climate ( and there should be one , because we are messing up the climate ) , the fact that it might cost me a thousand dollars a year in extra expenses might affect the quality of what restaurants I patronize and which grape I drink .
But , what will it do to a poor person ?
It might affect the quality of protein on their family 's table .
It 's a dilemma .
On the one hand you have a moral principle : the polluter pays .
On the other hand , the relative fraction of my disposable income that that would represent is much less than that of a poor person in a hot country , or even a poor person in the United States .
Energy costs are in that sense a regressive tax .
You cannot hold the sustainability agenda of the planet hostage to artificially low prices of commodities like food or energy , any more than you can allow what the first President Bush said at the 1992 Rio Environment Conference : i.e. " the American standard of living is not up for negotiation . "
In fact , if we 're talking about poor people demanding equity , and therefore having per capita equality with us as polluters , we 're talking about quintupling CO2 in the next century .
That 's unacceptable from the sustainability point of view .
On the other hand , when we 're saying that we will make the world safe for Hummers and SUVs at any and all costs , that 's not morally acceptable either .
So the question is , how do you make deals where the over - consumers ( us ) work out a deal with the over - populated and the not yet fully consuming group ( developing countries ) , so that they do n't just repeat the Victorian Industrial Revolution with the sweatshops , dirty coal burning , internal combustion engine , etc . ?
The answer is that these economies in transition need to leapfrog right over it to high technology .
Exhibit C : cell - phone .
If you go into Central China , they talk to each other on cell - phones — well , so do we ( we being the Europeans , Australians , Americans — the OECD type countries ) .
But how did we learn to communicate ?
We used mega tons of materials : copper wires , and we used energy to do it .
China has not done that to our scale .
Their cities are wired , but not the countryside .
They literally leapfrogged over the Victorian Industrial Revolution to high - tech with regards to communication via cell phone technology .
We have to get them to do the same with primary energy and transportation , so that they can produce the kind of economy that gives them a decent standard of living without polluting the planet to a point where they and much of the rest of the world suffer a standard of living decrease .
It can be done .
It ca n't be done by China alone , or India alone , or us alone .
But it can be done by good faith bargains — and that brings us back to that sine qua non —cooperation and skills - transfer .
... I am not motivated in any of this by knowing the truth .
I do n't know the truth — nor does anyone else — about the future .
What I teach , when I teach my Environmental Literacy course at Stanford , is to help confused students sort out how to tell this guy 's claim from that guy 's contradictory claim ?
I say , well , if a new dentist moves into town and hangs up a shingle that says , Painless Dentistry , what are you going to think ?
What about a new shop claiming to sell only Bargain Antiques ?
Or what do you think about a country that calls itself the Democratic People 's Republic of Such - and - Such ?
When the claim is in the title it 's usually because the opposite is the truth .
Check it out before buying it .
You have to watch out for the myth - busters and the truth - tellers or the deniers of any risk or the ones who have absolute thresholds below which we 're fine and above which everything ends — none of that is a very good description of our more probabilistic knowledge of future events and concerns .
What we know is that the warmer we get the more we add systems at risk and the more intense the impacts .
We know that we need to slow down the rate at which we increase that risk without having to know precisely where these many impacts thresholds are , because they are not precisely knowable in advance .
They are experiments we 're performing on Laboratory Earth and — as I said in my book of that title from 1997 — it is a " gamble we can't afford to lose " .
That 's how I try to frame the problem .
I was told by an environmentalist the other day that using the language of tipping point phenomena ( i.e. we must move now or we 'll be irreversibly lost ) is a good way to get people 's attention .
I said , well , that may be true for some phenomena but we do n't know where the points are .
We can guess , but what if we 're wrong ?
What if we say that we have ten years and we do n't do much ?
If nothing much has happened in 10 years , what then ?
Another tipping point 10 years later ?
People are going to remember what you said 10 years ago and your warnings are going to carry less and less weight and your predictions less credibility .
We live long enough that you have to be able to answer for your predictions .
I much prefer to say that it just gets increasingly difficult to deal with the more and more warming we keep adding to the system .
As with environmental literacy , watch out for the myth - busters , the truth - tellers , the ones with the simple answers from either side .
You can almost always believe more somebody who 's talking in ranges or subjective probabilities or bell curves , but at the same time is n't shy about saying that there 's some real risks out there we need to mitigate .
Another reason I have opposed the " ten year framing " is the possibility that society will go on with business as usual and do nothing much .
Then what ?
Do we say in ten years all is lost ??
That is very counterproductive — what I call the On the Beach mentality after the Nevil Shute novel that was made into a movie .
In it , the radioactive cloud from the nuclear war in the north is moving to Australia and they have months to live .
Given that final inevitability , why not go out and race your car and go for derring - do of all kinds and get killed having fun ?
You 're going to be dead anyway soon enough , and radiation sickness is a horrible death .
But that 's not the right metaphor for climatic thresholds .
Every single thing we do that slows warming down is better than doing nothing .
But even if you fail to get adequate measures implemented soon , you do n't give up , you keep trying to prevent it from getting higher and worse .
That 's my style , and not easy to sell in a sound bite , but I think you have to tell the truth .
To me we do n't really know what the absolute thresholds are , so let 's not gamble that we might get the most dangerous ones , not because we 're sure , but because we 're prudent .
As for the climate denialists , we 've seen their kind before — and gladly they are a vanishing breed in both smoking and global warming , though a few prominent ones are still out there spouting .
Just remember , watch out for the myth - busters and the truth tellers and listen to the careful ones talking in ranges and bell curves .

James Pinkerton looks at the future of libertarian ideas by pondering where we might be in 2058 :
First , true freedom — camouflaged from all - seeing eyes in the sky , hidden even from the all - penetrating Google Grid — can flourish only in a few small and isolated places around the globe , where self - selected populations can gather together as ex-pats and exiles , to live free or die .
These places have been mostly small islands , protected by nuclear booby traps , although a few have existed on the poles , or under the sea , or deep underground .
Poignantly , one such place was called “ Galt ’s Gulch , ” named after the place where the capitalist strikers hid out in Rand ’s Atlas Shrugged .
But this time , the strikers were real enough — until , of course , they met their tragic end at the hands of bounty - hunting looters .
So the second lesson :
No permanent victories for freedom can be found in this finite physical earth .
Hobbes was right :
The nation - state — sometimes , the imperial state — is the most effective monopolizer of force , thus the inevitable master of territory .
The third lesson :
The true frontier of freedom will have to be elsewhere , not in this physical world as we commonly think of it .
Many freedom - seekers have experimented with virtual reality as an escape hatch , or various kinds of nanotechnology .
We wish those dematerialized libertarian voyagers well — but , frankly , we do n’t know what has happened to them .
The fourth lesson is the keeper : A free world is a new world , the farther away , the better .
The next significant victory for freedom — a return to Randianism — will be best realized via transportation to somewhere else , off this earth .
Flight beats fight , especially when the freedom - fighter is guaranteed to lose to the statists in the end .
The Europeans who came to America found liberty in the empty spaces of the New World ; the same was true in Australia .
It ’s no accident that North America and Australia have traditionally been among the freest countries in the world .
And if they are now less free , in the middle of this grim 21st century , that ’s because they are increasingly filled up .
They have regressed to the regimented condition of the rest of the planet .

The Clintons blustered and bellowed , moaned and groaned , and cried all sorts of foul , but at the end of the day the DNC Rules Committee did not give them what they wanted .
Their votes on Michigan and Florida showed that there is a new leader of the party , and his name is Barack Obama .
From the get - go it was unlikely that Hillary Clinton was going to get her way with the Rules Committee .
She wanted all the delegates to be seated based on the results of the two primaries that were held in violation of Democratic Party rules .
Clinton tried everything from threatening a bloody convention fight to claiming that voters in the two states were being disenfranchised .
In the end , none of it worked .
Barack Obama will officially clinch the Democratic nomination sometime between Wednesday and Friday of next week , but history may show that the Hillary Clinton campaign ended today .

The Clinton favored proposal to seat the Florida delegates in full based on the results of the primary lost by a committee vote of 12 - 15 .
The Florida proposal that passed awarded Clinton 105 delegates to 67 for Obama , with each delegate getting half a vote at the convention .
In Michigan , Clinton had insisted that she be given 72 delegates to 55 for Obama .
The proposal passed by the committee by a vote of 19 - 8 awarded 69 delegates to Clinton and 59 to Obama , with each delegate receiving half a vote at the convention .
The total number of delegates needed for Obama to win the nomination is now 2,118 .
After picking up 32 delegates in Michigan and 36 in Florida , Obama now has 2,052 delegates and is 66 delegates short of the nomination .
There was a time only one short year ago when Hillary and Bill Clinton controlled the machinery of the Democratic Party .
With three votes today , the DNC Rules Committee passed that control to Barack Obama and a new generation of Democrats .
The era of the Clintons is over .
Today , a new generation of leadership has taken over .
GOP Contender Tied to Attorney Firing
Though virtually unknown outside the Albuquerque area , Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren
White is betting that his conservative credentials and close ties to the White House will help Republicans retain the hotly contested New Mexico congressional seat being vacated by Rep. Heather Wilson .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Wilson , in turn , is campaigning hard for the Senate seat that Republican Pete Domenici has held for 36 years in a race that could go a long way toward determining whether Democrats expand their narrow control of the U.S. Senate .
But all three of these Republicans – Domenici , Wilson and White – have something else in common :
They all were implicated in the firing of New Mexico ’s U.S. Attorney David Iglesias as part of the White House - driven federal prosecutor purge in 2006 .
Wilson is currently the subject of a preliminary House ethics probe related to a phone call she placed to Iglesias just a few weeks before the 2006 midterm elections , inquiring about the status of an indictment against a prominent Democrat in the state .
Domenici was the subject of a similar probe in the Senate over a call he made to Iglesias about the timing of indictments , a call that the Senate Ethics Committee said created an “ appearance of impropriety ” in a formal admonishment of the six - term senator .
Sheriff
White also reportedly was pushing Iglesias to crack down on Democratic - backed voter registration drives and then took his complaints about Iglesias ’s lack of aggressiveness to Washington .
In a little - noticed article in the Albuquerque Journal at the height of the U.S. Attorney scandal , White said he was upset with Iglesias ’s inaction against Democratic - back voter registration drives and other criminal issues .
White , who was New Mexico chairman of the Bush - Cheney 2004 campaign , confirmed that in spring 2006 , he took his “ complaints directly to the Department of Justice where he met with Attorney General [ Alberto ] Gonzales ' chief of staff , Kyle Sampson and others , " the Albuquerque Journal reported on April 15 , 2007 .
Sampson was chief of staff to Attorney General Gonzales and helped create the list of U.S. attorneys selected for dismissal , prosecutors who in Sampson ’s phrase were not “ loyal Bushies . ”
Trip to Washington According to interviews with several law enforcement officials in Bernalillo County and a review of documents ,
White traveled to Washington with two other Republican operatives in 2006 to complain to the Justice Department that Iglesias was balking at bringing criminal charges against what they called rampant voter fraud – and that he should be fired .
Law enforcement officials said White was accompanied by Mickey Barnett , a Republican lobbyist , and Pat Rogers , a Republican attorney , both of whom are based in New Mexico .
Rogers was affiliated with the American Center for Voting Rights , a now defunct non-profit organization that sought to defend voter rights and increase public confidence in the fairness and outcome of elections .
However , it has since emerged that the organization played a major role in suppressing the votes of people who intended to cast ballots for Democrats in various states .
Rogers is also the former chief counsel to the New Mexico Republican Party , and has been recommended by Domenici to replace Iglesias as U.S. Attorney for New Mexico .
Barnett , Rogers and White reportedly met with Monica Goodling , the Justice Department ’s White House liaison who resigned last year for the role she played in the unusual firing of nine U.S. Attorneys in the middle of a President ’s term .
Last May , House Democrats released a transcript of an interview between congressional investigators and senior Justice Department official Matthew Friedrich .
He said that over breakfast in November 2006 , Rogers and Barnett expressed frustration with Iglesias 's refusal to pursue voter fraud cases and that they had spoken to Karl Rove and Domenici about getting Iglesias fired .
" I remember them repeating basically what they had said before in terms of unhappiness with Dave Iglesias and the fact that this case had n't gone anyplace , " said Friedrich , who last week was named to head the Justice Department ’s Criminal Division .
" It was clear to me that they did not want him to be the U.S. Attorney .
And they mentioned that they had essentially . . . they were sort of working towards that . "
‘ Slick Move ’
Iglesias also had been hearing rumors in New Mexico political circles that White was the “ third man ” who personally complained to Justice Department officials that he was not pursuing voter fraud cases aggressively enough .
“ I was advised by Republican insiders that Darren viewed me as competition for future elected office , ” Iglesias said in an interview .
“ So it was a slick move on his part to try to get me removed for ‘ performance ’ knowing that that stigma would diminish my future electability .
The irony is that he could have called me and asked if I was considering running for Heather Wilson 's seat .
I would have said no . ”
Iglesias said
White also pressed him to prosecute voter fraud cases during the 2004 election .
In the months before the general election , Iglesias said White showed up at the county clerk 's office demanding to know if there were any questionable voter registrations on file .
Mary Herrera , the Bernalillo County clerk , told
White that there were about 3,000 or so forms that were either incomplete or incorrectly filled out .
Bernalillo County had been the target of a massive grassroots effort by the group Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) to register voters , which paid off with about 65,000 newly registered voters .
Sheriff
White intended to challenge the integrity of some of the names on the voter registration rolls , Iglesias wrote in a new book , In Justice : Inside the Scandal that Rocked the Bush Administration .
White seized upon the registration forms as evidence that ACORN submitted fraudulent registration forms .
He held a press conference along with other Republican officials in the county to call attention to the matter .
Iglesias said he established an election fraud task force in September 2004 and spent more than two months probing claims of widespread voter fraud in his state .
" After examining the evidence , and in conjunction with the Justice Department Election Crimes Unit and the FBI , I could not find any cases I could prosecute beyond a reasonable doubt , " Iglesias said .
" Accordingly , I did not authorize any voter fraud related prosecutions . "
Iglesias said he views
White ’s participation in his firing as an inappropriate attempt by a law - enforcement officer to pressure a prosecutor .
“ I question his judgment is attempting to remove a U.S. Attorney who did not find any cases worth prosecuting related to voter fraud , ” Iglesias said .
“ That shows a spectacular lack of understanding of how law enforcement works .
“ Cops complain all the time that prosecutors do n't take their cases , but it 's incredibly rare for the cop to seek the removal of the prosecutor .
But he was that highly politicized . ”
White ’s campaign refused to respond to questions about the sheriff ’s role in Iglesias ’s firing .
Contacted at the Bernalillo County Sheriff ’s station , White declined to comment for this story .
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has launched an ad campaign against
White that cites his role in Iglesias ’s firing .
" A federal prosecutor was fired only after he refused to bend to political pressure Darren White helped orchestrate , ” said Yoni Cohen , Western Regional Press Secretary for the DCCC .
" If he were in Congress , White would likely be under investigation for violating ethical standards … " Senator Domenici is paying the price for listening to Darren White -- he was punished by the Ethics Committee .
The people of New Mexico deserve better than another Republican Member of Congress who believes playing politics is more important than playing by the rules and honoring America 's system of checks and balances . ”

Pentagon said drawing up plans for strike on Iranian camp John Byrne
Published : Saturday May 3 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Military focus shifts from nuclear facilities to Revolutionary Guard The Pentagon is drawing up plans for a " surgical strike " against an alleged insurgent training camp in Iran , according to the UK Sunday Times ' Michael Smith .
Attributing the assertion to Western intelligence officials , Smith asserts that US officials have become increasingly frustrated with Iran 's Republican Guard force -- an elite corps of the country 's military -- which the Bush Administration has designated a terrorist group .
Western officials have accused Iran of helping arming rebel militias in Iraq , and have accused Iran of supplying IEDs .
Smith was the first to reveal the Downing Street Minutes , an account of a secret 2002 meeting between Bush Administration officials and British intelligence surrounding Iraq , in which MI6 director Richard Dearlove remarked that facts around Iraq were being " fixed " around a policy for war .
" US commanders are increasingly concerned by Iranian interference in Iraq and are determined that recent successes by joint Iraqi and US forces in the southern port city of Basra should not be reversed by the Quds Force , " Smith writes . "
' If the situation in Basra goes back to what it was like before , America is likely to blame Iran and carry out a surgical strike on a militant training camp across the border in Khuzestan , ' " he quotes a defense official as saying .
Nuclear facilities ' not targets ' Seymour Hersh in the New Yorker and RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna revealed internal Pentagon planning in a buildup to a potential Iran conflict .
Since the reports ran , however , rhetoric about Iran has been toned down and concerns of a potential all - out war have diminished .
American officials are opposed to any attack on Iranian nuclear facilities , Smith says .
They believe , however , that an attack on a militant camp could send a message to the Republican Guard .
CBS
News reported last week about a potential strike on Iran .
" Targets would include everything from the plants where weapons are made to the headquarters of the organization known as the Quds Force which directs operations in Iraq , " they wrote .
" U.S. officials are also concerned by Iranian harassment of U.S. ships in the Persian Gulf as well as Iran 's still growing nuclear program , " CBS adds .
" New pictures of Iran 's uranium enrichment plant show the country 's defense minister in the background , as if deliberately mocking a recent finding by U.S. intelligence that Iran had ceased work on a nuclear weapon . "
Sources told Smith that no attack was planned on Iranian nuclear facilities .
Such attack plans have been criticized , because many of Iran 's facilities are located underground and not all locations might be neutralized by an airstrike .
ï¿
½If an attack happens it will be on a training camp to send a clear message to Iran not to interfere , " one intelligence officer said .

As diplomats from more than 100 states unanimously passed a treaty banning the use of cluster bombs around the world , it emerged that British ministers are prepared to go further .
The government has agreed to scrap the two types of cluster weapon in the armoury of British forces , but it will also ask the US to get rid of its cluster bombs based here , and it will no longer ask for a " phasing out " period for its newest cluster munition - the M73 , which is attached to Apache attack helicopters .
Both this weapon and the M85 - an Israeli - designed artillery shell used by British forces during the 2003 invasion of southern Iraq - will now be scrapped as soon as possible .
Cluster weapons scatter " bomblets " across a wide area .
Many of them fail to explode , later killing and maiming civilians long after the weapons are fired .
Gordon Brown yesterday described the treaty - due to be formally signed in Oslo in December - as " a major breakthrough " .
He added : " We will now work to encourage the widest possible international support for the new convention . "
In a statement released by Downing Street , he said : " I am delighted that the negotiations in Dublin have come to a successful conclusion , and congratulate the Irish government and all those involved .
" I am confident that this agreement is in line with British interests and values , and makes the world a safer place . "
Final negotiations centred on the issue of " interoperability " - how far troops from countries signed up to the treaty should " cooperate " with troops from countries that have not , notably the US .
The US claimed last week that the treaty could jeopardise its participation in joint peacekeeping and disaster relief operations , as most American military units have cluster bombs in their armoury .
The US is not party to the Dublin talks , but officials in London emphasised yesterday that it was the government 's intention to ban cluster bombs at American bases in Britain .
Troops from Britain and other countries signing up to the cluster bomb ban would not be subjected to prosecution under international law if they were engaged in operations with those still free to use the weapons , the draft Dublin treaty is expected to say .
The Ministry of Defence was reluctant to abandon the UK's two cluster weapons , though some defence officials said yesterday that they were hardly going to be useful against small groups of Iraqi insurgents or Taliban fighters or in the battle for " hearts and minds " .
Campaigners and human rights groups welcomed the UK government 's ban on cluster weapons .
" The treaty will create a new international standard that will prevent the use of cluster munitions even by those countries that have not signed up , " said Simon Conway , of Landmine Action UK .
Along with the US , Russia , China , Israel , India and Pakistan are not taking part in the Dublin talks .
Oliver Stone 's new film , W , portrays George Bush as a foul - mouthed , dried - out drunk with a baseball obsession and a difficult relationship with his father .
Filming is expected to begin any day in Louisiana .
The movie should be in cinemas before Mr Bush leaves office next January .
Stone says the film wo n't be an anti-Bush polemic .
Rather , as he told Daily Variety , it will be " a fair , true portrait of the man that asks the question : how did Bush go from being an alcoholic bum to the most powerful figure in the world ? "

An early script describes Mr Bush as a party animal living in the shadow of his esteemed father before he uses religion to turn his life around .
He finds a new purpose in life – which is to achieve the presidency ahead of his brother Jeb , who was being groomed for high office by his father .
The film will cover Mr Bush 's obsession with invading Iraq and toppling Saddam Hussein – which Stone suggests is to avenge the Iraqi leader 's much ballyhooed assassination attempt on Bush Snr .
It will also look at Mr Bush 's desperate hunt for WMDs in Iraq and his well known mangling of the English language .
The script gives the impression that the White House is Mr Bush 's very own fraternity house where discussions about going to war sound like the staff are betting on a football game .
The film will capture notorious episodes including his arrest for tearing down the goalposts at a college football game , his widely reported threat to get into a fistfight with his father when he came home drunk in the 1970s , and how he quit drinking after his 40th birthday when he woke up with a hangover and marching orders from his wife .
Mr Bush will be played by Josh Brolin , who starred in the Coen brothers '
No Country for Old Men. Laura Bush is being played by Elizabeth Banks , who starred in The 40 - Year - Old Virgin .
This is Stone 's third film about a US president , following Nixon and JFK .
The director has been an outspoken critic of President Bush 's policy in Iraq .

In my professional life , I get quite involved in industry forums ( fora ? ) .
Today , for me , was quite a big day .
I had set up a workshop for my peers around the industry – roughly one per company , plus a few guest speakers – to discuss a professional issue .
All up , there were around 30 of us .
I was facilitating the session from the front .
After about half an hour , when I ’d started to relax as the discussion got going , I suddenly noticed something .
I was the only woman in the room .
While I often have the experience of being the only woman in a meeting , generally the total number of people in that case is in the single digits .
It ’s ironic .
Two years ago , when I took on my current role , I had a few old codgers congratulate me , and comment how women were taking over the profession .
At that stage there were four of us in that group .
Now the other three have moved on ( one is now a CEO , the others have different roles ) , and I ’m the only one left .
Ten , even five years ago , that sudden realisation would have given me stage fright .
Now I have the confidence to be quietly amused .
But I bet none of the men in the room have ever been close to being the single representative of their gender in a business context .
They would find it extraordinarily confronting , if they had .
All those people who confidently say that gender equality at the top of companies is a matter of time ?
Take a closer look .
It ’s not going to happen without serious cultural change .
This is n’t about helping women manage families .
To get serious representation of women at the top of companies , the culture of large organisations needs to genuinely include women .

MOUNT RUSHMORE NATIONAL MONUMENT , South Dakota , May 30 ( Reuters ) -
Even in the middle of a fierce presidential campaign , Barack Obama could n’t resist the opportunity to go on a field trip .
When the Democratic White House hopeful heard the press corps and some staff members were planning a late - night trip to see Mount Rushmore National Monument , he decided he did n’t want to be left out .
So , shortly after arriving in South Dakota after an evening campaign rally in Montana , Obama made the 30 - minute car trip to see the monument , of four presidents chiseled into the side of a massive granite outcropping .
After a park ranger gave him a private explanation of the national monument , Obama noted that his daughter Malia had told him she had gone on a field trip on Friday .
“ I had one too , ” he said , as he walked away from the flood - lit monument .
He laughed when asked if he could imagine his face chiseled into the granite some day .
“ I do n’t think my ears would fit , ” he said .
“ There ’s only so much rock up there . ”

Too many choices you 're not interested in making can drain your self - control to stick to goals , such as a diet or big project , a new study suggests .
Woe to the caffeinated , for gone are the days of simply grabbing a coffee .
Today 's order requires surviving a gauntlet of choices : Latte or Americano ?
Flavored or plain ?
Cream and sugar ?
Small , medium or large ?
And the list goes on .
New research shows that such daily decisions eat up limited mental resources , ultimately rendering our self - control into mush .
Which means making too many decisions might be why many people can't stick to a diet , finish a big project or even complete simple daily tasks .
" It 's a strange paradox because human beings are drawn to choice , " said study co-author Kathleen Vohs , a marketing professor at the University of Minnesota 's Carlson School of Management .
" We love having more choices , but at the same time the human psyche is easily overcome by them . "
Vohs and her team , who conducted a battery of experiments during the past four years , detail their findings on how making decisions grates away self - control abilities in a recent issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
Goal grinders
Good self - control shares space with decision - making , Vohs said , in part of the brain 's prefrontal region — a wrinkly section just behind your forehead .
" We 're now looking at the relationship between overload of choice and self - control , and specific portions of the prefrontal region seem very much involved in both , " Vohs said , referring to new brain scan research her team is performing .
" We think taxing one of them weakens that area and it's not able to recover in time to engage in the other . "
Whether good or bad , small or large , she explained that the very act of deciding seems to steal away brain power for sticking to goals .
" Even if you just have to decide between two cups of coffee at Starbucks , it 's a small choice , true , " she said , " but doing that over the course of a day will , by the end of the day , render you less able to be good at self - control . "
Subject shopping
To figure this out , the researchers conducted seven experiments .
In one of the trials , subjects were asked to pick from a selection of consumer products , then afterward coerced to show will power by dunking their hands in ice - cold water or downing a bitter yet healthy beverage .
Turns out those who made more decisions before their unpleasant challenge kept their hands in the ice water for less time than or did n't finish as much drink as people who had fewer choices .
Another experiment used college students and had one group pick out courses to satisfy a degree while another group did n't have to make such choices .
Researchers gave both groups math problems to study and , similar to the other experiments , the decision - makers performed worse and were more likely to succumb to distractions such as playing video games or reading magazines than those who were n't forced into choosing courses .
To add to their laboratory results , the researchers took their work to the decision - making hub of any community : A shopping mall .
Shoppers who said they made more decisions during their day ended up scoring the worst on an impromptu math test than other shoppers .
Fun choices — such as deciding on a free gift from a registry — also turned up to be draining , although less than aversive choices .
Decision distinction
Richard Ryan , a clinical psychologist at the University of Rochester in New York who was n't involved in Vohs ' work , said he finds the study compelling , but cautioned that it may not apply to all choices we make .
" This is n't a test of freedom of choice , " Ryan said .
" In this work , people were given tasks under some kind of coercing .
When you 're choosing from things you want to do , there 's evidence to suggest it 's actually energizing . "
He explained that Vohs ' group sees the mind as a muscle that fatigues .
" This may be partially true , but we add energy when we fulfill basic psychological needs , " he said .
" When I choose to see a loved one , for example , that 's an energizing choose .
Deciding on one of 20 different lotions in a store ?
That 's a different story . "
Choice strategies
Vohs said deferring decisions you do n't really care about to someone or something else is a good idea to reserve brain power to stick to your guns on things you do care about .
" If you 're on a diet , follow a dietary plan to limit your choices .
If you do n't care what you do with your significant other this weekend , politely defer that decision to them , " Vohs said .
" Putting the burden on someone else seems might seem mean , but if a goal is really important to you , it 's a fantastic idea . "
As for wading through those countless coffee shop decisions ?
" If you 're just looking for a caffeine fix and do n't care what form it comes , " Vohs said , " just tell the barista to make their personal favorite . "

Government Inflation Data Does Not Match Reality
In an age where governments of every political stripe distort economic data to promote their own self - interests , it 's hardly surprising that they present inflation statistics that are wildly at odds with the reality faced by consumers and businesses , and regarded with utter disbelief .
In the latest US government report on inflation for instance , there was a glaring “ seasonal adjustment , ” for energy prices that cast great doubt as to the accuracy of the findings .
US Labor Dept apparatchniks said consumer prices rose a smaller than expected 0.2 % in April , tamed by energy prices , which were unchanged last month .
Utilizing an obscure “ seasonal adjustment , ” Labor figured that gasoline prices actually fell 2 % in April , which does n't reflect the reality of what consumers were paying at the pump .
Furthermore , the IMF 's global food price index rose 43 % over the last 12 - months , but the US consumer price index for food is only 5.1 % higher .
Bernanke Fed versus Volcker View of Inflation
Wall Street cheered the tame inflation rate , reckoning it gives the Federal Reserve more time to peg the fed funds rate at 2 % , to jig - up the stock market with massive money injections .
But the folks who are n't fooled by the government 's propaganda on inflation are the American people , whose dollars buy less with each passing month .
The inflation tax is the great thief of the middle class .
For the 12 - months through April , prices for US imports were 15.4 % higher .
Yet Wall Street economists massaged the data , and explained that wholesalers and retailers are absorbing the higher costs out of reluctance to increasing prices and driving away customers .
Should we trust the inflation statistics conjured - up by government apparatchniks , or rather , place greater faith in the depreciating dollars and cents that flow through the commodity markets each business - day ?
According to the chart above , unleaded gasoline futures traded on the Nymex ended + 12.2 % higher in April , at $ 2.93 / gallon .
The US Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) , said average retail gas prices actually shot up 9.5 % in April from March .
Less than two weeks later , gasoline futures advanced another 10 % to a record $ 3.22 / gallon , and retail prices are closing in on $ 4 / gallon nationwide .
On May 14th , upon hearing Labor 's report of a scant 0.2 % inflation rate during April , former Fed chief Paul Volcker had doubts about the way the government measures inflation .
“ It does n't feel quite right .
I think the bias clearly is more towards higher inflation , offset by the weakness of the domestic economy , ” he said .
“ Seasonal adjustments ” are just one of the useful tools that Labor apparatchniks have developed to fudge inflation statistics .
The Bernanke Fed has a simpler model , it simply strips out food and energy costs , in its inflation calculus .
Labor apparatchniks said retail food prices in April were + 5.1 % higher from a year ago .
Yet , the Dow Jones Agricultural Commodity Index , which measures a basket of corn , coffee , cotton , soybeans , soybean oil , sugar , and wheat , was up 40 % in April from a year earlier .
Major central banks have greatly increased the levels of cash available to banks and brokers to stave off a credit crisis , and much of the excess money has found its way into agricultural and energy futures .
Also driving up food prices is bio - fuel production , which jumped 43 % in the year through March .
The American Farm Bureau Federation calculates that bio - fuel use accounts for up to 30 % of the food price surge .
About a third of the US corn crop , or 4 - million bushels , is expected to go to making ethanol this year .
The White House 's chief economist , Ed Lazear said rising energy costs account for as much as 20 % of rising food prices , while the sliding dollar accounts for about 13 % of this increase .
Other factors supporting higher food prices are bad weather in traditionally big production areas , and tastes in Asia that are shifting toward greater consumption of proteins from meat and poultry which requires more grains to help produce .
Not included in US inflation statistics is the Baltic Exchange 's Sea Freight Index , which monitors the costs of shipping dry goods across 40 major trade routes for minerals , grains , cement and sugar .
Earlier today , the key gauge of global economic activity jumped 4 % to a record 11,067 .
Asian demand for grains and natural resources has not been dented by the global banking crisis or the economic recession in the United States .
Freight shipping costs on key export routes are 75 % higher than a year ago , and 1100 % higher than seven years ago .
The Fed 's latest rate - cutting spree , taking the fed funds rate to 2 % from 5.25 % last September , has opened up the monetary floodgates , in order to jig - up the stock market , but also fueled a global commodity boom unlike anything witnessed since the 1970's .
The weak US dollar is contributing to yet another speculative binge , this time in commodities , led by crude oil 's surge to $ 127 a barrel this week .
The US M3 money supply is running + 16.5 % higher from a year ago , near its fastest rate of expansion in history , and far above the growth rate of the US economy .
That 's generating powerful inflationary pressures that are far outstripping wage increases .
But on February 25th , a top Fed official Frederic Mishkin , defended the central bank 's prevailing focus on “ core inflation , ” and stripping out food and energy costs , in order to keep the printing presses rolling at full speed .
“ Stabilizing core inflation leads to better economic outcomes than stabilizing headline inflation .
If central banks raise rates aggressively to counter inflation caused by a sudden rise in oil prices , unemployment will be markedly higher , ” Mishkin warned .
“ The shock of energy price increases will likely wear - off and have only a temporary impact on inflation .
When inflation expectations are well anchored , the central bank does not necessarily need to raise interest rates aggressively to keep inflation under control following an aggregate supply shock , ” he argued .
But on May 14th , former Fed chief Volcker strongly disagreed , and warned the US economy could face a 1970 's - style period of skyrocketing inflation , if consumers and investors lose confidence in the buying - power of the US dollar .
“ If there is a real loss of confidence in the dollar , then I think we are in trouble .
That is something that has to be watched .
That has to be very much in the forefront of our thinking , without that , we are back to the inflation of the 1970's or worse . ”
The Fed has already pumped half - a- trillion dollars into the financial system in the form of open market operations and its special emergency lending measures .
Much of the excess cash in the financial system has not yet shown up in the economy , because the banks are afraid to lend the money .
But once the credit crunch eases , the excess liquidity could not only expand bigger bubbles in the commodity markets , but also fuel hyper-inflation in the US economy , if not drained out quickly .
“ If inflation gets too high , the economy will suffer dramatically , ” warned Kansas City Fed chief Thomas Hoenig on May 6th , in unusually candid remarks .
“ Rising price pressures are not temporary , as some assert , but are more serious .
These increases are beginning to generate an inflation psychology to an extent that I have not seen since the 1970's and early 1980's .
Energy , food and other commodities have simply soared .
If an inflationary psychology becomes embedded , it will require significant monetary policy tightening to reduce it , ” he warned .
Yet soaring commodity inflation is greatly at odds with historically low US Treasury yields , and it 's difficult to understand why investors are still holding 10 - year US Treasury notes , which could be the next major bubble to burst .
Are n't strong price pressures in the commodities markets getting noticed in the bond market , especially with oil shooting north of $ 125 a barrel , retail gasoline costs at $ 4 a gallon and basic food staples such as corn , soybeans , wheat and rice doubling in price ?
China and Japan boosted their holdings of US Treasury securities by $ 18 billion in March , and the Arab oil kingdoms added $ 25 billion , mostly through their brokers in London .
However , institutional investors worldwide have plowed $ 40 billion into commodity index funds so far this year , lifting their bets to $ 200 billion .
Retail investors added $ 16 billion into commodity exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) in the first four months of this year , and ahead of last year 's pace of $ 15 billion .
The Dow Jones Commodity Index is up 24.5 % , and the Reuter 's CRB Index , with a greater energy weighting , is up 39 % from a year ago , far outpacing the returns in US Treasuries , in an environment of escalating inflation .
The Fed 's last two rate cuts equaling 100 basis points to 2 % have back - fired , by lifting the commodities markets , especially crude oil , while undermining the 10 - year Treasury note market , which fell to a three - month low this week , lifting its yield to as high as 3.98 percent .
On April 15th , NBER chief economist , Martin Feldstein , a top advisor to the Bernanke Fed , said surging commodity price inflation should stop the US central bank from cutting its overnight lending rate below 2 percent .
“ It would make sense for the Fed to stop cutting its target rate at between 2 % and 2.25 % , because to go lower could exacerbate the problem of inflation emanating from high commodity prices , ” Feldstein said on CNBC television .
There is now widespread speculation that the Fed 's rate cutting spree has ended at 2 % , but most likely , the central bank will drag its heels on combating inflation , and move in slow - motion baby - steps , when raising interest rates .
Seeking a quick fix to the slide in US T - Notes , the US Treasury is banking on the doctored - up consumer price index to contain the rise in 10 - year yields at 4 percent .
Yet efforts to keep interest rates below the inflation rate , simply provides fertile ground for commodity traders and operators in the stock market .
Japanese Bond Traders awaken from Grand Illusion ,
Japanese bond traders have been brainwashed by government propaganda artists for more than a decade , and programmed into believing that Japan , one of the world 's biggest importers of food and energy , is immune to global inflation .
But after reporting a decade of deflation , Ministry of Finance apparatchniks are finally forced to paint a rising inflation trend , after crude oil prices doubled and a ton of Asian grown rice soared 120 % from a year ago .
Last month , Japanese consumer inflation was reported at a decade - high of 1.2 % in March , led by rising fuel , raw materials and food prices .
Ironically , the Bank of Japan 's super - low interest rate of 0.50 % encourages global traders to borrow funds in yen , in order to bid - up commodities and stocks worldwide .
Yet it 's tough to get the BoJ to shift to a tighter money policy , because the Japanese government is addicted to low interest rates , saddled with a national debt of $ 6.7 trillion .
Earlier this week , Japanese 10 - year government bond ( JGB ) yields surged 20 basis points to a seven - month high of 1.75 % , while at the same time , the DJ Commodity Index jumped to a record high at 22,600 - yen .
Two weeks ago , on April 25th the JGB market suffered its biggest one - day JGB fall in five - years , as foreign investors sold a net 588 - billion yen ( $ 5.6 billion ) of Japanese bonds , spooked by signs of inflation .
Tokyo tried to hold down the cost of imported commodities , especially for base metals , crude oil , and grains , by allowing the Japanese yen to rise against the US dollar .
A 13 % rise in the yen helped to cap the year - over - year increase in the Dow Jones Commodity Index to 10 % in local currency terms .
However , the yen has begun to weaken again from its peak on March 17th , which is allowing global inflationary pressures to sneak into the Japanese economy .
Will the Bank of Japan tighten its monetary policy to strengthen the yen and cap the rise in commodity prices ?
On May 12th , BoJ chief Masaaki Shirakawa said , no .
“ We need to bear in mind that real short - term interest rates are around zero , a very low level .
So if we are certain that the Japanese economy will follow a growth path under stable prices , we will be adjusting interest rates .
However , we are now at the stage where we need to pay utmost attention to the downside risks to the economy . ”
The Bank of Japan has kept its overnight loan rate pegged at an abnormally low 0.50 % for the past 15 - months .
However , since the Fed 's climactic rescue of Bear Stearns on March 17th , yields on the US Treasury 's 2 - year note have risen faster than comparable Japan yields , climbing to +168 basis points today , from a low of +80 bp in mid-March , when the dollar fell to a 13 - year low of 96 - yen .
But soaring commodity and global shipping costs , combined with a weaker yen , are now conspiring to ratchet up inflation in the world 's second largest economy , which in turn , is starting to undermine the Japanese bond market .
At some point in the future , when the Nikkei - 225 climbs out of danger 's way , the BoJ could eventually vote for a baby - step 0.25 % rate hike to 0.75 % in the months ahead .
Global Commodity Boom Rocks South Africa
As a major exporter of platinum , gold , and coal , there is a chance that South Africa might erase last year 's $ 5.5 billion trade deficit , even as it grapples with soaring oil prices .
Still , the South African rand is roughly 15 % lower against the US dollar , and the Dow Jones Commodity Index is 40 % higher from a year ago .
On May 15th , South African central bank ( RBSA ) chief central bank chief Tito Mboweni pointed to soaring food and fuel prices as the main risks to inflation , and warned that these pressures are spreading to other sectors throughout Africa 's largest economy .
The targeted CPIX consumer inflation gauge is far above the RBSA 's 3 - 6 % target range , hitting a five - year high of 10.1 % in March .
“ Initially , these shocks were confined to oil and food prices , but more recently electricity price increases have compounded the problems , ” the RBSA said .
A 14.2 % increase in the electricity tariff approved in April , and the possibility of a weaker rand have worsened the inflation outlook .
State power utility Eskom , struggling to meet rising demand for electricity , has already asked for another 53 % rate hike .
The RBSA has lifted its repo rate by 450 basis points to 11.5 % since June 2006 , to curb credit - driven consumer demand .
“ The MPC remains committed to bringing inflation back to within the target range over a reasonable time horizon .
From time to time central banks will confront the problem of persistently stubborn high inflation .
The job of the central bank in that situation is to tighten monetary conditions to try and bring inflation back to within the target range as soon as possible .
Whether a country pursues inflation targeting or not , any central bank worth its salt would pursue low inflation , ” Mboweni said on May 15th .
Unlike the “ Group of Seven ” central bankers , who hide behind distorted government inflation data , to keep their interest rates low , South Africa 's central bank is beyond the “ jawboning ” stage , and is actively tightening its monetary policy , to prevent further weakness in the rand , and contain commodity inflation .
The RBSA could certainly use a helping hand from the G - 7 central banks , in the form of tighter monetary policies , to help control global inflation .

Following on from some news from the Yomiuri about religious belief , this time it is BlogCh and iShare looking at two types of fraudulent nonsense , blood typing and fortune telling .
Demographics
Both surveys were conducted between the 22nd and 24th of May 2008 .
For the blood type survey , 506 people completed the online survey , including 30 people who did n’t know their blood type .
55.7 % of the sample were male , 12.3 % in their twenties , 48.2 % in their thirties , 28.7 % in their forties , and 10.9 % of other ages .
For the astrology survey , 504 people completed the online survey .
55.3 % of the sample were male , 12.3 % in their twenties , 48.2 % in their thirties , 28.6 % in their forties , and 10.9 % of other ages .
All respondents were members of the free mail forwarding service CLUB BBQ .
It should be rather obvious where I stand on the issue , but I must admit to watching and enjoying the blood type race every weekday morning at about 9:50 at the end of Toku Da Ne .
It ’s quite fun to watch just to see if my wife or I win , and the advice is usually quite silly , although I always suspect she takes it rather more seriously than me .
Regarding Q2 , my wife was convinced that I was type B , and she knew she was an A , as they both fitted her image of our personalities , but when we had a health check a few years ago , the results came back with different blood types for both of us .
Oh , I nearly forgot my two contributions to the world of divination , My Buddhist Name and brainscannr .
Research results
Q1 : Have you ever had , read a blood type fortune , blood type divination ?
( Sample size=506 ) Yes No Type A
N=193 67.4 % 32.6 % Type B
N=112 78.6 % 21.4 % Type O
N=132 69.7 % 30.3 % Type AB
N=39 69.2 % 30.8 % Male
N=282 56.7 % 43.3 % Female
N=224 82.1 % 17.9 %
The spike for type
Bs might be due to that type being seen as the worst type .
Q2 : Have you ever had predicted “ That person must be blood type X ” ?
( Sample size=506 ) Yes No Type A
N=193 73.6 % 26.4 % Type B
N=112 76.8 % 23.2 % Type O
N=132 65.9 % 34.1 % Type AB
N=39 74.4 % 25.6 % Male
N=282 60.6 % 39.4 % Female
N=224 81.7 % 18.3 % Q3 : Do you think there is a relationship between blood type and character ?
( Sample size=506 ) Considerable relationship
Some relationship
No relationship Type A
N=193 12.4 % 58.5 % 29.0 % Type B
N=112 14.3 % 61.6 % 24.1 % Type O
N=132 15.2 % 49.2 % 35.6 % Type AB
N=39 5.1 % 61.5 % 33.3 % Male
N=282 11.3 % 51.4 % 37.2 % Female
N=224 13.8 % 62.9 % 23.2 %
Type AB is supposed to be the best type , so is it modesty preventing a lot of people admitting a strong relationship ?
Now , we move on to fortune telling .
Q4 : When there is a good outcome from fortune telling do you believe it ?
( Sample size =504 ) Mostly believe it Believe it a little Do n’t believe it All 9.7 % 54.2 % 36.1 % Male
N=280 7.5 % 49.6 % 42.9 % Female
N=224 12.5 % 59.8 % 27.7 % Q5 :

N=280 2.5 % 36.8 % 60.7 % Female
N=224 4.5 % 45.5 % 50.0 % Q6 : From where have you obtained a fortune telling ?
( Sample size=504 , multiple answer ) All Male
N=280 Female

On this , the 15th day of April , 2008 , it does not hurt to do a brief comparison between the Bible ’s account of the tyranny of Egypt and our own democratically elected taskmasters .
The story of Joseph in Egypt is the story of how the people of Egypt came under the tyranny of a king who claimed divinity for himself .
The biblical text does not say that this Pharaoh made such a claim , but we know from historical texts that the pharaoh was regarded as a divine - human link .
When he died , he was believed to journey to the realm of the gods .
He was the official source of meaning in the cosmos .
He was also responsible for allocating scarce economic resources for the benefit of the State .
The estimation of the Pharaoh , not the estimations of acting buyers and sellers in free markets , was the standard of economic value .
It was incumbent on the Pharaoh to make accurate cost - benefit estimates if the nation was to prosper .
Egyptologist Henri Frankfort made this clear in a book published in 1948 .
The king is not only instrumental in producing the ‘ fat of the land ’ ; he must also dispense it .
Only then is there evidence that he functions effectively .
His bounty proves that he disposes , as a king should dispose , of the earth and its produce .
. . .
But the king also keeps alive the hearts of all those subjects who do not directly partake of his bounty .
For he exercises a never ending mysterious activity on the strength of which daily , hourly , nature and society are integrated .
[ Henri Frankfort , Kingship and the Gods .
A Study of Ancient Near Eastern Religion as the Integration of Society & Nature ( University of Chicago Press , [ 1948 ] 1962 ) , pp. 59—60 . ]
The king was understood to direct the very forces of nature .
It was the king , and only the king , whose judgments concerning economic production were sovereign .
The Egyptians began with a false theology .
They assumed , incorrectly , that their supreme ruler was the incarnation of the State as well as the very cosmos .
This assumption was bound to lead to negative consequences .
Joseph was the agent of these consequences .
ACCURATE FORESIGHT
The text tells us that the pharaoh had a dream that he was unable to understand : seven fat cattle were eaten by seven lean ones .
Then he had a second dream , much like the first one : seven fat stalks of grain were eaten by seven lean ones .
None of his court prophets and soothsayers could tell him what this meant .
Then one of his advisors told him of a man he had met during a stay in prison .
This fellow prisoner had accurately forecast the death of another man imprisoned with them , as well as the success of the advisor .
The pharaoh brought Joseph before him .
He asked Joseph if he could interpret the dream .
Joseph did .
There would be seven years of good harvests followed by seven years of famine .
“ And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice ; it is because the thing is established by God , and God will shortly bring it to pass ” ( Genesis 41:32 ) .
It always helps to have the equivalent of Warren Buffett interpreting the data for you .
But you must also know what to do to protect yourself — even profit from the information .
Lest pharaoh miss the point , Joseph made the connection .
He described a plan dear to the hearts of political leaders down through the ages .
He recommended that the government raise taxes .
Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise , and set him over the land of Egypt .
Let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint officers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years .
And let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine ( Genesis 41:33 — 36 ) .
But who might this be ?
Joseph , a prudent man , did not name anyone in particular .
It is never wise to appear self - serving .
He just waited .
He did not have to wait long .
And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his servants .
And Pharaoh said unto his servants ,
Can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the Spirit of God is ?
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this , there is none so discreet and wise as thou art ( Genesis 41:37— 39 ) .
Once they had made up their minds — or at least the pharaoh made up his mind , and the yes - men who surrounded him concurred — the pharaoh announced a new economic order .
Thou shalt be over my house , and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled : only in the throne will I be greater than thou .
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , See , I have set thee over all the land of Egypt .
And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph ’s hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had ; and they cried before him , Bow the knee : and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. ( Genesis 41:40 — 43 ) .
Then came the climax : “ And Pharaoh said unto Joseph , I am Pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt ” ( Genesis 41:44 ) .
Joseph was given total power as the agent of the State .
So , Joseph had moved from prisoner to advisor and from advisor to second in command .
This had taken maybe a couple of hours .
This was a terrific deal for Joseph .
The pharaoh was treating him with the same kind of respect that the media treat the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System .
It is as if this account looked forward to Alan Greenspan — though clearly not to Ben Bernanke , for the text says specifically , “ Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon : and he shaved himself ” ( Genesis 41:14a ) .
Notice the chain of events .
The divine - human link in the most bureaucratic tyranny of the ancient world had two dreams that he could not understand .
His advisors also did not understand them .
So , on the say - so of a lower bureaucrat , the divine - human link brings a man out of prison to tell him what is going on .
The prisoner becomes second in command .
This was centralization of power on a scale that would have made Julius Caesar salivate , let alone Lyndon Johnson .
THE PREDICTIONS CAME TRUE
It turned out that Joseph ’s predictions came true .
This was possible because :
A. He was inspired by God.B. He had not received a Ph.D. in economicsC .
He was fresh out of prison .
D. He shaved .
E. All of the above .
The grain was stored in urban storage facilities .
As soon as the famine hit , this arrangement would bring the rural population to the cities , hats in hand .
This is what happened .
And when all the land of Egypt was famished , the people cried to Pharaoh for bread : and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians , Go unto Joseph ; what he saith to you , do .
And the famine was over all the face of the earth : and Joseph opened all the storehouses , and sold unto the Egyptians ; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt .
And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn ; because that the famine was so sore in all lands ( Genesis 41:55 — 57 ) .
The State did not give away grain .
It sold the grain back to those from whom the State had collected grain for seven years .
Heads , the State wins .
Tails , the State wins .
The State sold to foreigners , too .
The Egyptian State ’s balance of payments went positive and stayed positive .
In year two , Joseph made his offer :
Then Joseph said unto the people , Behold , I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh : lo , here is seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
And it shall come to pass in the increase , that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh , and four parts shall be your own , for seed of the field , and for your food , and for them of your households , and for food for your little ones ( Genesis 47:23 — 24 ) .
He offered to buy a fifth of the land in perpetuity on behalf of the divine - human incarnation of the State .
The people did the appropriate thing , politically speaking .
They praised their master .
And they said , Thou hast saved our lives : let us find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh ’s servants .
And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth part ; except the land of the priests only , which became not Pharaoh ’s ( Genesis 47:25 — 26 ) .
WAS THIS BIBLICAL ECONOMICS ?
In 1963 , I was a student at Westminster Theological Seminary .
There , I heard about the interpretation of this section of the Bible that had been offered by a popular professor at a small Presbyterian college that sent graduates to Westminster .
As the story came to me , the professor had argued that this was a biblical case for central economic planning and taxation .
I decided then that I would eventually write something that addressed this interpretation .
I did so in 1982 in Chapter 23 of my book , The Dominion Covenant : Genesis .
You can download it for free here .
What the professor failed to understand was this : Joseph ’s recommended system was a condemnation of central planning .
Why ?
Because in order for it to work , the State must have the following :
1. A divine - human head of State2 .
Divinely inspired dreams by this figure3 .
A divinely inspired interpreter of dreams4 .
An interpreter who can put two and two together and reach a practical conclusion ( i.e. , not an academic economist ) 5 .
The power to impose new taxes at any time6 .
An army of tax collectors7 .
A nation of political sheep8 .
A willingness to fleece the sheep once9 .
A willingness to fleece them forever
In contrast to “ Egyptian ” economics is biblical economics .
The prophet Samuel warned the Israelites , who demanded that he ordain a king like other nations had .
And he said ,
This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you :
He will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots .
And he will appoint him captains over thousands , and captains over fifties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his chariots .
And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries , and to be cooks , and to be bakers .
And he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your oliveyards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
And he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
And he will take your menservants , and your maidservants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his work .
He will take the tenth of your sheep : and ye shall be his servants .
And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you ; and the LORD will not hear you in that day ( 1 Samuel 8:11 — 18 ) .
This warning fell on deaf ears .
“ Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel ; and they said , Nay ; but we will have a king over us ” ( I Samuel 8:19 ) .
The Bible is clear :
When the central government collects as much in taxes as God demands in the form of a tithe — 10 % — the nation has moved into tyranny .
It has moved in the direction of Egypt .
The Israelites in Samuel ’s era , let it be noted , wanted this change in administration .
They wanted a highly centralized State .
They voted for it .
Conclusion : “ There is no political salvation in democracy if the voters are hell - bent for tyranny . ”
A TASTE OF TYRANNY
Joseph in Egypt brought the Egyptian nation more firmly under tyranny .
Why ?
For the same reason that the prophets of Israel and Judah said that God would judge them by captivity in foreign lands .
The Egyptians had attributed to a man what God alone possesses : absolute sovereignty .
They had declared their faith in the divine State .
Joseph let the Egyptians get a taste of tyranny .
Eventually , Israelites were given this same lesson .
A pharaoh arose who did not honor the tradition of Joseph .
Under Joseph , the Israelites inherited the land of Goshen .
That inheritance was removed by the Egyptians .
Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens .
And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities , Pithom and Raamses .
But the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and grew .
And they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour :
And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage , in morter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , wherein they made them serve , was with rigour ( Exodus 1:11 — 14 ) .
This tyranny was consistent with the theology of Egypt : subservience to a divine - human political leader in a bureaucratic State .
It was inconsistent with the theology of Israel .
The trouble was , the Israelites could not shake free of this theology until after the captivity to Assyria and Babylon .
They longed to return to Egypt .
“ We remember the fish , which we did eat in Egypt freely ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlick ” ( Numbers 11:5 ) .
CONCLUSION
In today ’s world , to get back to the tyranny of Egypt — 20 % of income — the various levels of civil government would have to cut taxes by at least half .
The trouble is , the voters ’ response is familiar .
“ And they said , Thou hast saved our lives : let us find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh ’s servants . ”
They do not cry out to God for deliverance back to the “ low - tax ” regime of Egypt .
Egypt was a veritable flat - tax paradise compared to modern America .
Yet Christians and Jews vote for more of the same .
So , the tax ratchet will continue upward .
The regulatory system will tighten .
If the victims cannot recognize tyranny when they are taxed by it , then they are blind indeed .
They need additional experience with tyranny .
They will get it .

– The key to breast cancer is to know all the prevention methods .
It is a known fact that 1 in 8 women have a chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime .
Various causes can lead to the development of breast cancer , but making simple lifestyle changes can reduce your risk of breast cancer .
Here are 20 effective ways which can help you in breast cancer prevention :
1 . It ’s never too late to quit smoking :
Though smoking does not link to breast cancer , some researches confirmed that smoking a pack daily for 11 or more years can increase the risk of breast cancer up to 40 % .
Also , the studies showed that women who smoked for 20 years or more and had hormone replacement therapy are twice at a risk of developing breast cancer than the women who never smoke or have hormone replacement therapy .
2 . Say goodbye to alcohol :
Drinking alcoholic beverages increase the chance of developing breast cancer .
Women who take 2 - 5 drinks in a day are about 1 ½ times at higher risk than women who do n’t consume alcohol .
Alcohol consumption change the way of your body metabolizing estrogen .
Most of the breast cancers are fueled by the estrogen hormone .
Postmenopausal women are at greater risk of developing breast cancer .
Beginning the consumption of alcohol before the age of 30 is more closely linked to breast cancer risk .
3 . Avoid hormone replacement therapy :
Researchers showed a link between hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer and suggested that both estrogen and progesterone replacement therapies raise the risk factor .
The longer you take HRT , the greater is the chance of developing breast cancer .
Also , the effectiveness of mammograms decreases with HRTs .
If you want to undergo hormone replacement therapy , consult your doctor about the risks and your personal condition .
4 . Stay on low fat diet :
Low fat diet not only reduces the risk of obesity but also decrease the chance of developing breast cancer .
We all know that estrogen has a great role in development of breast cancer .
Fat tissues contain little amounts of estrogen and if you consume high fat diet , it increases your risk .
The studies found that women who ate high fat diet are 15 % more likely to develop breast cancer than women who ate low fat diet .
Limit the intake of fat up to 20 percent .
5. Maintain healthy body weight :
Gaining weight in midlife , irrespective of BMI can significantly increase the risk of breast cancer .
So , maintain your BMI less than 25 throughout your life .
Higher BMI increases the risk in postmenopausal woman .
6. Consume fruits and vegetables as much as you can :
According to the studies , fruits and vegetables reduce the risk of breast cancer by 40 percent .
Eat seven or more servings of fruits in a day .
Fruits and vegetables which reduce the risk include : broccoli , Brussels , cabbage , cauliflower , sprouts , dark green leafy vegetables , carrots , tomatoes , cherries , citrus fruits , and berries .
7. Regular physical activity :
Most of the studies showed that regular physical activity offers great safety against breast cancer .
Engage for 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activities for five or more days in a week .
Consistency and duration are the key factors .
8. Avoid high glycemic index diet :
Avoid the consumption of high glycemic index diet as there are great hazards .
Foods like white rice , white flour , sugar , white potatoes , and foods containing these products can trigger hormonal changes in your body , which again lead to cellular growth in your breast tissues .
Instead of these high carb diets , consume whole grains , legumes and beans .
9 . Minimize exposure to pharmacologic products containing estrogen :
Avoid the consumption of prescription estrogens unless it is prescribed by your doctor .
Exposure to estrogen for greater amount of time can lead to the development of cancer .
Avoid estrogen like compounds found in environmental pollutants like industrial chemicals and pesticides .
Minimize your exposure to residual compounds which can be found in non-organic dairy products like poultry and meat .
10 .
Eat seaweeds :
Consume seaweeds like kelp and nori .
Take blue green algae like chlorella and spirulina in a glass of juice daily .
These products contain chlorophyll , which have anti-carcinogenic effect and fight against free radicals .
11 . Consume high fiber foods :
Getting large amounts of fiber from beans , whole grains , fruits and vegetables is very important .
Fiber stops your body ’s metabolism of estrogen and lessens the blood levels of estrogen .
Consuming high fiber foods decrease the breast cancer risk up to 54 percent .
12 . Get enough amounts of fatty acids :
Consumption of at least three servings of cold - water fish in a week is very important .
You will get enough amounts of fatty acids by consuming tuna , mackerel , cod , sardines , mackerel , salmon and halibut .
Also , you can get fatty acid from fish oil capsules or vegetarian supplements of algae .
13 . Know the secrets of soy products :
Regularly consume soy products like miso , tofu and tempeh .
Soybeans and other soy products have genistein .
This is a natural plant estrogen that helps in binding the receptors in your breast and makes it impossible to connect the cancer causing substances of estrogen with the breast tissues .
According to the studies , women who ate lot of soy products are at lower risk of developing breast cancer .
14 . Get a mammogram test :
Getting mammography test is as essential as self examination of your breasts .
This test detects the cancer cells in your breast so that you can immediately seek medical help .
Always it is not possible to detect the lumps through self examination , so mammogram is essential to confirm .
15 .
Have children in early ages :
Having children at 20s decreases the chance of developing breast cancer .
Having children in 30s or without children increases the risk .
16 . Prefer breast feeding instead of formula feeding :
According to the studies , breast feeding and months without period may decrease the risk of breast cancer .
This confirms that early menopause lowers the risk of breast cancer .
17 .
Take multivitamin :
Start taking a daily multivitamin .
Taking vitamin
A is necessary for the immune system and also regulates cell growth .
This helps in lowering the risk of breast cancer .
18 . Take monounsaturated fats :
Research showed that monounsaturated oils like canola and olive oil have less cancer producing substances .
So , prefer these oils than using other oils .
19 .
Take aspirin :
Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs slow down the production of estrogen with the help of prostaglandins .
Aspirin obstructs these prostaglandins , which again blocks the production of estrogen .
Taking aspirin every day can decrease the risk of breast cancer by about 20 percent .
Take it after consulting your doctor .
20 .
Eat allium vegetables :
Consume allium vegetables like onions , garlic , shallots and leeks .
For greater benefit , eat raw alliums .
Garlic is a best food source for protecting against cancer as it contains anti-cancer mineral selenium , which stimulate the production of white blood cells and leads to death of cancer cells .
" My greatest joy was without a doubt to be able to bring happiness to those of you who never gave up on believing in me .
My true friends , now we have been redeemed .
I spent the day reading and re-reading the messages from you on the internet .
You have no idea how happy I am .
I am certain any fighter would love to have fans like you .
I went through three hard months , training for this fight , and it was n’t just once or twice that the messages from you uplifted me and stimulated me to keep on training intensely .
This fight was decisive .
I was under a lot of pressure .
I had to win by all means .
But at these tough times I could see you guys were with me .
To have the affection of you guys on my side is an honor , it is priceless .
I was very moved and felt like crying after the win .
Thank God I cry from happiness .
At that moment I thought of all of you excited by this so long - awaited moment !!
Now you can also talk to me on MySpace ( myspace.com/wanderleisilva ) .
Here I ’ll be able to get to know you better .
I have n’t the words to thank you enough for the strength you have given me .
Let ’s beat our chests and celebrate with much joy , because this victory is ours !!
Thank you so much . "
How Are You Fighting Global Warming ?
A Freakonomics Quorum
Whenever the subject of global warming comes up on this blog , readers have plenty to say .
There are a lot of things to think about , of course , including the effectiveness ( or lack thereof ? ) of carbon taxes ; the environmental impact of a global food market ; even whether it ’s greener to drive than walk .
For the average person , the issue probably seems maddeningly tangled , large , and abstract .
So we thought we ’d strip things down here and ask a very simple set of pertinent questions of a variety of people — some of them well - known and others less so — each of whom thinks about the subject in a very personal way .
Here are the questions we put to them :
What ( if anything ) do you do now to fight global warming that you did n’t do two years ago ?
What behavior would you would find impossible ( or difficult ) to change ?
How concerned are you about global warming ?
Here are their responses .
Feel free to share yours as well .
Yoram Bauman , an environmental economist at the University of Washington who has performed at venues ranging from Oxford to New York Improv as a “ stand - up economist . ”
What ( if anything ) do you do now to fight global warming that you did n’t do two years ago ?
Top of the list :
One year ago my girlfriend and I started shacking up together .
( Yes she told me to say that , and in all honesty it probably is the most important thing we ’ve done . )
Just for the record though , I think she ’s going too far in arguing that she should get carbon offsets for taking birth control pills .
Beyond that , well , I ’ve worked hard to put material into my comedy routine about climate change and how we need to use a tax shift or other market forces to find solutions .
Talking about tax shifting and other policy measures is important because Americans prefer to focus on individual action : “ Let ’s go out and get it done ! ”
Unfortunately , individual action by itself is not going to get us where we need to go this time around .
We need something even more powerful , and that ’s where market forces come into it .
Of course , that does n’t mean that changing your light bulbs to compact fluorescents is n’t worthwhile .
I ’ve done that too , but on a personal level a bigger effort for me has been reducing the number of plane trips I make for comedy gigs .
( As a very rough rule of thumb , flying produces the same carbon emissions per passenger as driving the same distance solo in a 30 mpg vehicle . )
As for how I ’ve reduced my air travel — well … um … mostly I did it by raising my fees .
I know that sounds like quite a sacrifice — ah , to be an economist comedian — but you ca n’t raise your fees indefinitely without losing both customers and revenue .
That ’s tough because it ’s hard to disappoint fans and it ’s also hard to turn down large piles of easy money .
What behavior would you would find impossible ( or difficult ) to change ?
This is a dumb question — with so much low - hanging fruit around , why ask about what ’s at the top of the tree ?
But since you asked : I can limit my air travel , but the bottom line is that stand - up comedy is not exactly something you can do by video conference .
I know this because I once suggested a video conference performance to some groups at MIT that wanted to hire me .
If anybody would have gone for this you ’d think it would have been MIT , but I never heard back from them .
Also , I love hot showers .
But look , let ’s be realistic :
If Americans have to give up on air travel and hot showers in order to save the world , then the world is just not going to get saved .
Yes we can cut down on our air travel and yes we can use low - flow shower heads , but if the world is going to get saved we ’re going to need to develop energy sources that are cheap , renewable , and non-polluting — and the best way to do that is by using a tax shift to harness market forces to protect the environment .
How concerned are you about global warming ?
Pretty concerned , for two reasons .
One is that there ’s a small chance that global warming will turn out to be really bad for people in America .
Harvard economist Martin Weitzman has written that there ’s a 3 percent chance that global temperatures this century will rise by 6 degrees C ( 11 F ) or more , calling it a “ terra incognita of what any honest [ economist ] would have to admit is a planet Earth reconfigured as science fiction . ”
Now you might say that a 3 percent chance is n’t much , but it ’s awfully scary to me .
( I should note here that chances are much greater than 3 percent that climate change will be really bad for people in places like Bangladesh , because they ’re poorer and more vulnerable and hence more likely to be overwhelmed .
The good news is that poor countries are likely to become richer over the coming decades ; the bad news is that as they become richer they will have increased demand for things like air travel and hot showers , making it all the more important to — guess what ? — use a tax shift to develop energy sources that are cheap , renewable , and non-polluting . )
A second reason Americans should be concerned is more of a meta reason :
The level of climate change discourse in the U.S. is much lower than it ought to be , and there ’s way too much skepticism of the scientific consensus about climate change .
I ’m particularly disturbed by the skepticism demonstrated by otherwise intelligent libertarians and conservatives .
Apparently there really are people who believe in social Darwinism but do n’t believe in Darwin ‘s theory of evolution .

What ( if anything ) do you do now to fight global warming that you did n’t do two years ago ?
Recently , I just finished a large re-insulating project in my home .
I really wanted to see if , by using more modern energy auditing technology , I could raise the energy efficiency of my home even further .
By using a combination of infra-red cameras and pressure measuring equipment , we were able to identify additional heat and air leaks in my home , seal them up , and create an even more efficient building envelope .
I ’m now experiencing month to month drops ( depending on climate conditions ) of 30 percent to 50 percent in both my electricity and natural gas usage .
Saving energy and saving money — I ca n’t think of two better reasons to do this .
Another thing I ’m doing now is riding my bike again .
Two years ago I got so busy with TV and the theater that I stopped riding my bike .
Now , I have a new hybrid electric bike from IZip called The Express and I ’m riding it multiple days per week as transportation , as well as for fitness and for traffic reduction here in smoggy and congested L.A.
I ’m really committed to riding a bike again and I hope I ’m leading by example and more people will follow .
What behavior would you would find impossible ( or difficult ) to change ?
I wo n’t use the word “ impossible , ” but it is difficult to convince my wife to conserve power and resources with the same zeal that I do .
How concerned are you about global warming ?
I ’m quite concerned , mainly because of the tremendous amount of data that is currently available in peer review studies .
Many people with Ph.D. after their names feel that this is a real problem , so I ’m inclined to think they are correct .
I always encourage people to do their own research — there is so much data available now .
But I also tell people that even if they are n’t completely convinced by this scientific data , why would you put a patient with a fever in a sauna ?
And , what ’s wrong with putting money in your pocket , reducing our dependency on Mid-East oil , and cleaning up pollution in cities like Los Angeles , Houston , and Bakersfield ?
Polly Smith , field chemist in Astoria , Queens .
What ( if anything ) do you do now to fight global warming that you did n’t do two years ago ?
I no longer own a car : living in New York City , I have no real need for my own vehicle .
The subway and PATH systems get me just about anywhere I need to go .
I feel this helps both our environment and our health — reducing the amount of carbon monoxide emissions into our environment .
If I ever do need a car again I will definitely look into getting a hybrid car — especially with the rising gas prices !
I look into more biodegradable / recyclable everyday products : cleaning products , organic foods , recycled paper products , etc .
Along with this , both at home and at work I try to recycle as much as I can .
Especially at work , we are trying to move away from paper and towards electronic copies of documents .
It can be difficult at times , but I do believe it is the right thing to do .
What behavior would you would find impossible ( or difficult ) to change ?
Even though I do n’t have a car of my own — until we are able to move completely to fuel cell / electric cars , it would be close to impossible to survive without cars .
We live in a world where we are so connected to people far away : I have family and friends on either side of the world and across the U.S.A. — without cars and planes I would rarely or never get to see these people .
Thus , to throw out fuel - powered machines which emit harmful gases such as carbon monoxide would be something extremely difficult to change with technology being at the point it is now .
How concerned are you about global warming ?
Having a degree in chemistry has exposed me to a range of different theories in regards to global warming : some say we are definitely going through a warming , others say we are going through a global cooling —
I ’m concerned about our environment , as I believe we have damaged it greatly , so I do try to reduce my impact on the earth by reducing my own carbon footprint .
Roy Spencer , author of Climate Confusion and the U.S. Science Team leader for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer flying on NASA ’s Aqua satellite .
What ( if anything ) do you do now to fight global warming that you did n’t do two years ago ?
Since I believe that global warming is largely natural , and not man made , I do n’t do anything to “ fight ” global warming since that would be futile .
But to the extent that we will need to eventually move away from carbon based fuels , I am helping to spur the investment in new energy technologies by consuming as much as possible today .
Increased consumption builds wealth and that wealth will be needed to fund the R&D into alternative energy technologies .
And the second thing I do ?
Encourage others to do the same .
What behavior would you would find impossible ( or difficult ) to change ?
It would be exceedingly difficult for me to go without : air conditioning in the summer , heating in the winter , a good filet of beef on occasion , gasoline to go wherever I want , and everything else that we use in life that requires energy … which , last I knew , includes everything .
But since doing and using all of these things will encourage new investments in energy technology ( see above ) , I ’m happy to report that I do n’t need to give up anything !
How concerned are you about global warming ?
I do n’t think we need to be concerned about global warming as a process , but we do need to be concerned about our response to the belief that global warming is our fault .
We need to be concerned about helping the poor to lift themselves out of poverty so that they can deal with whatever climate change that does occur .
After all , as history has shown , the climate will change with or without us , and the poorest countries of the world are the most susceptible to hurricanes , typhoons , cyclones , tornadoes , floods , and everything else that Mother Nature so lovingly doles out .
We are now starving poor people because we have diverted food ( corn ) to be used as liquid fuel ( ethanol ) .
Punishing the use of energy with the Lieberman - Warner Climate Security
Act is exactly the opposite of what we need to do .
While I ’m in the minority on this issue , the tide is beginning to turn , and I can only hope that we will eventually stop sacrificing the world ’s poor at the altar of radical environmentalism .
Rudy Maisto , captain of the Lady L , a charter sport fishing boat in Brooklyn .
What ( if anything ) do you do now to fight global warming that you did n’t do two years ago ?
I have n’t changed anything , and to tell you the truth , in a sense I feel that global warming is not 100 percent true because a lot of the things that are happening happened before .
Put it this way :
How does anybody know 100 percent what the problem is and what will cure it ?
I go along with the flow , but I ’m not someone that ’s fanatic about it .
I change things like aerosols to sprays and keep up with emissions on the boat and car …
This is what they ’re saying needs to be done .
In fishing things go through cycles — so does everything else .
I also have a snow plow business …
In the 1980 ’s we went through a spurt with not much snow .
In 1994 and 1992 we had record years of snow .
1996 was astronomical … but 2006 to 2008 were not so good .
This is why I say : cycles .
Back in the 1960 ’s we had major droughts … it ’s one extreme or another .
What behavior would you would find impossible ( or difficult ) to change ?
I ’ve tried contacting the Army Corps of Engineers to get rid of a lot of floating debris in the water , but it ’s more or less senseless .
Once in a blue moon you see a skimmer boat .
It ’s crazy first of all , because [ debris ] is a hazard to navigation … and all the docks floating in the water , telephone poles , and plastic bags are bad for the environment .
How concerned are you about global warming ?
I am concerned because everything that I do is more or less environmental and depends on weather .
A few years ago we had tons of storms and charters got canceled . …
But last year they predicted New York would get hit with the worst hurricane they ever had and it would get hit with more after that .
Did you see them ?
I ’m not 100 percent convinced but I ’m not unconvinced . …
It ’s something to think about .
John Micklethwait , editor - in - chief of The Economist .
What ( if anything ) do you do now to fight global warming that you did n’t do two years ago ?
It is only honest to confess that my carbon footprint has increased dramatically since 2006 .
Since I became editor , just over two years ago , I travel far more than I did ( this is being written on a plane somewhere between Singapore and Sydney ) .
Even in London I bicycle far less : there always seems to be something to read .
At home , we are supposedly just about to replace our old Renault Scenic with a Prius hybrid ( though , to be honest , that decision could also be justified on grounds of style , comfort , or speed ) .
More has changed at The Economist , where we are currently investigating the possibility of going carbon neutral .
However , even if we take that massive step I would still argue that our main contribution to fighting global warming comes through what we write and advocate .
Global warming is going to be solved not by individual but by collective action , and we have done our bit to encourage that along by , for instance , advocating a carbon tax .
What behavior would you would find impossible ( or difficult ) to change ?
I think flying is the most difficult to replace .
Teleconferencing has gotten far better : recently we had a virtual meeting with Cisco with three people from California facing three of us in London on screens which made the meeting eerily lifelike .
But on - the - ground reporting is essential for good journalism — that is why we have kept on increasing the number of foreign bureaus .
I need to go to these places too — sailing and swimming are not really options .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Starbucks Corp SBUX.O said on Wednesday it would slash U.S. coffee store openings through 2011 as it adjusts to slower U.S. growth and turns its focus to expanding newer international markets .

The company , which warned last week of the worst economic environment in its history , blamed the domestic housing crisis for a significant quarter - over - quarter deterioration in U.S. customer traffic and said it saw early signs of a potential traffic slowdown in the United Kingdom , which may be related to economic problems there .
Chief Executive Howard Schultz , brought back in January to lead a turnaround of the company , continued to dismiss fears that Starbucks was overbuilt or that new competitors like McDonald 's Corp MCD.N were stealing customers with coffee drinks .
The U.S. mortgage meltdown was leaving customers less to spend , he argued .
“ We strongly believe it is not the competition ...
We do n’t believe that we ’ve saturated the market , but we do believe that we have a head wind the likes of which we ’ve never seen , ” Schultz told analysts in a conference call .
Wall Street was lukewarm to the company ’s pull - back in new openings .
“ It ’s not really surprising that they ’ve slowed their store growth .
The fact that they are making plans to slow it is certainly better than what they were telling us before , ” said John Langston , an analyst at Hodges Capital Management .
On Wednesday , the coffee shop chain posted fiscal second - quarter net income of $ 108.7 million , or 15 cents per share , compared with $ 150.8 million , or 19 cents per share , a year earlier .
Results from the most recent quarter included restructuring - related charges of about 3 cents per share .
The company last week warned that the results would be weak .
Prior to that , analysts had been looking for a second - quarter profit of 21 cents per share .
Wednesday ’s results matched lowered estimates , according to Reuters Estimates .
Total revenue rose a smaller - than - expected 12 percent to $ 2.53 billion after sales at U.S. stores open at least 13 months fell in the mid-single digits .
Starbucks ’ U.S. stores delivered 77 percent of total revenue and experienced slower traffic during the quarter .
Starbucks is bracing for its first full - year profit decline since 2000 , forecasting fiscal 2008 per share earnings that are somewhat lower than the 87 cents reported last year .
Nevertheless , it is forecasting accelerating earnings for 2009 through 2011 .
Starbucks sees per share earnings in a range of 90 cents to $ 1 for fiscal 2009 , of $ 1.10 to $ 1.20 for 2010 and $ 1.35 to $ 1.50 for 2011 .
In a bid to improve its fortunes , Starbucks said it planned to reduce its fiscal 2008 U.S. store openings to 1,020 , the second decrease this year .
When founder Howard Schultz returned as CEO , he cut the company ’s fiscal 2008 store openings to 1,175 from 1,600 .
The company opened nearly 1800 stores in fiscal 2007 .
Under the new plan , U.S. company - owned and licensed store openings would be limited to 400 per year in 2009 through 2011 , while international openings in those years would range from 1,050 to 1,300 .
Schultz in the past has said that the company , with its coffee drinks that can easily cost $ 4 each , was virtually immune to economic weakness .
On Wednesday , he specifically linked its woes to the U.S. housing crisis , saying it has been hardest hit by foreclosure leaders California and Florida , which account for about one - third of Starbucks ’ retail sales .
“ Starbucks coffee and premium coffee experience has , over time , been an affordable luxury .
And at this time , it is n’t for some people , ” Schultz said .
Starbucks shares fell to $ 16.11 from their Nasdaq close of $ 16.23 .
They had gained 3 cents during regular trade .
Grant B. asked me to post the derivation for the right and left Kan extension formula used in previous Kan Extension posts ( 1,2 ) .
For that we can turn to the definition of Kan extensions in terms of ends , but first we need to take a couple of steps back to find a way to represent ( co)ends in Haskell .
Dinatural Transformations
Rather than repeat the definition here , we 'll just note we can define a dinatural transformation in Haskell letting polymorphism represent the family of morphisms .
type Dinatural f g = forall a. f a a -> g a a
Ends
So what is an end ?
An end is a universal dinatural transformation from some object e to some functor s .
Diving into the formal definition :
Given a functor , and end of is a pair where is an object of and omega is a dinatural transformation from e to S such that given any other dinatural transformation to S from another object x in , there exists a unique morphism , such that for every in .
We usually choose to write ends as , and abuse terminology calling the end of .
Note this uses a dinatural transformation from an object in , which we can choose to represent an arbitrary dinatural transformation from an object to a functor in terms of a dinatural transformation from the constant bifunctor :
newtype Const x a b = Const { runConst :: x }
This leaves us with the definition of a dinatural transformation from an object as :
Dinatural ( Const x ) s ~ forall a .
Const x a a -> s a a
but the universal quantification over the Const term is rather useless and the Const bifunctor is supplying no information so we can just specialize that down to :
type DinaturalFromObject x s = x -> forall a. s a a
Now , clearly for any such transformation , we could rewrite it trivially using the definition :
type End s = forall a . s a a
with = id .
type DinaturalFromObject x s = x ->
End s
And so End above fully complies with the definition for an end , and we just say e =
End s abusing the terminology as earlier .
The function = id is implicit .
For End to be a proper end , we assume that s is contravariant in its first argument and covariant in its second argument .
Example : Hom
A good example of this is ( -> ) in Haskell , which is as category theory types would call it the Hom functor for Hask .
Then End ( -> ) = forall a . a -> a which has just one inhabitant id if you discard cheating inhabitants involving fix or undefined .
We write or to denote a -> b .
Similarly we use to denote an exponential object within a category , and since in Haskell we have first class functions using the same syntax this also translates to a -> b .
We 'll need these later .
Example : Natural Transformations
If we define :
newtype HomFG f g a b = HomFG { runHomFG :: f a -> g b }
then we could of course choose to define natural transformations in terms of End as :
type Nat f g = End ( HomFG f g ) -- forall a. f a -> g a
Right Kan Extension as an End
Turning to Wikipedia or Categories for the Working Mathematician you can find the following definition for right Kan extension of along in terms of ends .
Working by rote , we note that is just c ->
K m as noted above , and that is then just ( c -> K m ) ->
T m' .
So now we just have to take the end over that , and read off :
newtype RanT k t c m m' = ( c -> k m ) -> t m ' type Ran k t c = End ( RanT k t c )
Which , modulo newtype noise is the same as the type previously supplied type :
newtype Ran f g c = Ran { runRan :: forall m. ( c -> f m ) -> g m }
Coends
The derivation for the left Kan extension follows similarly from defining coends over Hask in terms of existential quantification and copowers as products .
The coend derivation is complicated slightly by Haskell 's semantics .
Disposing of the constant bifunctor as before we get :
type DinaturalToObject s c = forall a . ( s a a -> c )
Which since we want to be able to box up the s a a term separately , we need to use existential quantification .
( forall a. s a a -> c ) ~ ( exists a. s a a ) -> c
We cannot represent this directly in terms of a type annotation in Haskell , but we can do so with a data type :
data Coend f = forall a .
Coend ( f a a )
Recall that in Haskell , existential quantification is represented by using universal quantification outside of the type constructor .
The main difference is that in our coend the function is now runCoend instead of id , because we have a Coend data constructor around the existential .
Technicalities make it a little more complicated than that even , because you can't define a well - typed runCoend and have to use pattern matching on the Coend data constructor to avoid having an existentially quantified type escape the current scope , but the idea is the same .
Left Kan Extension as a Coend
Then given the definition for the left Kan extension of along as a coend :
we can read off :
data LanT k t c m m' = LanT ( k m -> c ) ( t m ' ) type Lan k t c = Coend ( LanT k t c )
Which is almost isomorphic to the previously supplied type :
data Lan k t c = forall m. Lan ( k m -> c ) ( t m )
except for the fact that we had to use two layers of data declarations when using the separate Coend data type , so we introduced an extra place for a to hide .
A newtype is n't allowed to use existential quantification in Haskell , so this form forces a spurious case analysis that we 'd prefer to do without .
This motivates why category - extras uses a separate definition for Lan rather than the more elaborate definition in terms of Coend .
[ Edit : Fixed a typo in the definition of RanT ]

Artist 's Statement A sequel , of sorts , to 2004 ’s “ The Shithead Vote . ” I began drawing this almost immediately after the primary in West Virginia , where Obama lost by a significant margin to Hillary Clinton , who in exit polls was perceived by 100 % of voters as “ more white . ”
He lost by a wide margin again last week in Kentucky — like West Virginia , another of the historical “ bumfuck states . ”
Kind of an awkward reality for the media to have to deal with , here .
On the one hand , they have to take this factor into account in handicapping their electoral horse - race , plus any new perceived microtrend or passing interpretation of significance in poll results is fodder for rumination on the 24 - hour news cycle .
Once every four years they have to treat every whim and prejudice and superstition and wackjob theory of the electorate as phenomena to be taken seriously .
Except the sticky part is , mainstream media also officially likes to pretend that widespread racism no longer exists , and that instances of racial prejudice are some sort of atavistic aberration , like vestigial tails or cannibalism , that can be exposed to the light of public disapproval and purged from the body politic by the ritual of scandal , outrage , reprimand , and scapegoating .
The media raises a hysterical outcry , someone apologizes or gets fired , and we can all go as before .
But there it is , this ugly poll result nobody can ignore : 2 in 10 voters in West Vriginia and Kentucky are citing race as a “ major factor ” in their vote .
Now I do n’t want to be a glass - is - half - empty man ; 2 in 10 is better than 10 in 10 , which is what it would ’ve been fifty years ago .
But those are still some wide margins of loss , and it ’s hard to politely ignore the fact that there are still a lot of old - school racists out there .
The media is torn between the imperative to take them seriously as a voting bloc and their instinct to disapprove .
So they just neutrally report the numbers and avoid the delicate “ issue ” while we all secretly think to yourselves : crackers , hillbillies , bigots .
A few weeks ago a dining companion said she was relieved that Obama had finally given in and worn an American flag lapel pin , because it shut up the sort of people who care about such things and took that issue out of their arsenal .
I understood what she was saying , but I could n’t bring myself to feel the same way .
I was disappointed that he gave it to them .
I ca n’t believe we still have to take those people seriously and validate their idiot bleating about God and country .
Do we really have to keep pretending , at this point , to give a shit what those people think about anything at all ?
This country is a wreck and a laughingstock today because those people got everything they wanted for the last eight years .
Does n’t it ever occur to any of these yokels who do n’t trust Obama because he can’t bowl : hey , maybe I do n’t want a guy like me running the country , seeing as how I ca n’t even pay child support or get the fucking cable turned back on ?
Maybe I want somebody smarter than me in charge for a change .
We ’re at a grave and crucial moment in this country ’s history , and once again we ’re held hostage by the dim suspicions of people who think Obama is a Muslim Manchurian candidate .
The most powerful nation on earth , still shackled to the idiot man-child of the South .
The situation is perhaps best synopsized by the Onion op - ed : “ Yee - Haw ! My Vote Cancels Out Y’all ’s ! ”
There really is a Max Fightmaster , by the way .
My colleague Emily ’s boyfriend ships CDs around the world , and one of the people he sent an order to was one “ Max Fightmaster , ” who is , even more unbelievably , a soldier in Iraq .
Thanks and an unironic salute to Max Fightmaster , wherever you are !
Several American officials said they did not believe that the Israeli government had concluded that it must attack Iran and did not think that such a strike was imminent .
Shaul Mofaz , a former Israeli defense minister who is now a deputy prime minister , warned in a recent interview with the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot that Israel might have no choice but to attack .
“ If Iran continues with its program for developing nuclear weapons , we will attack , ” Mr. Mofaz said in the interview published on June 6 , the day after the unpublicized exercise ended .
“ Attacking Iran , in order to stop its nuclear plans , will be unavoidable . ”
But Mr. Mofaz was criticized by other Israeli politicians as seeking to enhance his own standing as questions mount about whether the embattled Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , can hang on to power .
Israeli officials have told their American counterparts that Mr. Mofaz ’s statement does not represent official policy .
But American officials were also told that Israel had prepared plans for striking nuclear targets in Iran and could carry them out if needed .
Iran has shown signs that it is taking the Israeli warnings seriously , by beefing up its air defenses in recent weeks , including increasing air patrols .
In one instance , Iran scrambled F - 4 jets to double - check an Iraqi civilian flight from Baghdad to Tehran .
“ They are clearly nervous about this and have their air defense on guard , ” a Bush administration official said of the Iranians .
Any Israeli attack against Iran ’s nuclear facilities would confront a number of challenges .
Many American experts say they believe that such an attack could delay but not eliminate Iran ’s nuclear program .
Much of the program ’s infrastructure is buried under earth and concrete and installed in long tunnels or hallways , making precise targeting difficult .
There is also concern that not all of the facilities have been detected .
To inflict maximum damage , multiple attacks might be necessary , which many analysts say is beyond Israel ’s ability at this time .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A U.S. judge ordered the Central Intelligence Agency on Thursday to submit to the court a 2002 memo said to specify harsh interrogation methods used on suspected terrorists held abroad .
The American Civil Liberties Union said the memo was written by the Department of Justice ’s Office of Legal Counsel and sent to the CIA in August 2002 .
The ACLU described the memo as “ one of the most important torture documents still being withheld by the Bush administration . ”
In a copy of the order posted on the ACLU ’s Web site , Judge Alvin Hellerstein told the government to produce the memo so he can determine whether it should be made public as part of a lawsuit the ACLU and other organizations filed in June 2004 requesting records concerning the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody abroad .
Hellerstein has scheduled a review of the document for Monday .
“ This memo authorized the CIA to use specific torture techniques -- including waterboarding , ” Jameel Jaffer , ACLU ’s national security project director , said in a statement .
“ CIA agents waterboarded prisoners because this memo told them that they could , ” he said .
“ The memo is being withheld not for legitimate security reasons , but in order to protect government officials from accountability for their decisions . ”
Waterboarding is a simulated drowning technique .
The ACLU said more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to its lawsuit .
Among those was a declassified 2003 memo , released by the U.S. Justice Department on April 1 , that justified the use of harsh interrogation methods for suspected terrorists held abroad .
A subsequent decision overruled the memo , which said President George W. Bush ’s authority as commander - in - chief superseded international law regarding wartime interrogations .
The U.S. military has banned the use of waterboarding and other harsh methods considered by some rights advocates to be torture .
The U.S. intelligence community has not .
Bush authorized the CIA to use waterboarding after the September 11 attacks in 2001 , but he has repeatedly insisted that the United States does not torture prisoners .
The CIA has said it used waterboarding during the interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who faces murder charges in the U.S. military court at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .

We all like when error messages are descriptive and give a clear idea about what is happening ; however , there are some cases when a few possible reasons lay behind one error message .
“ MySQL server has gone away ” is one of them .
Most of the cases when the error occurs are described in MySQL documentation , but it can get tricky .
And here , I ’d like to talk about “ tricky ” .
There are only a few major cases when this happens :
1. MySQL Thread Was Killed by an Administrator or a Utility Such as pt-kill
The manual intervention is likely to be intermittent and , as it is a one - time thing in certain situations ( e.g. , a bad long - running query ) , probably would be known to a DBA .
Pt - kill might be less noticeable , as it is often left running as a workaround to prevent those bad long queries from taxing system resources .

Researchers from the Carnegie Institution ’s Geophysical Laboratory , together with colleagues at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory , have found that when magnetite is subjected to pressures between 120,000 and 160,000 times atmospheric pressure its magnetic strength declines by half .
They discovered that the change is due to what is called electron spin pairing .
Magnetism comes from unpaired electrons in magnetic materials .
The strength of a magnet is a result of the spin of unpaired electrons and how the spins of different electrons are aligned with one another .
This research showed that the drop in magnetism was due to a decrease in the number of unpaired electrons .
“ Magnetite is found in small quantities in certain bacteria , in brains of some birds and insects , and even in humans , ” commented Yang Ding , the study ’s lead author with the Carnegie - led High - Pressure Synergetic Consortium .
“ Early navigators used it to find the magnetic North Pole and birds use it for their navigation .
And now it is used in nanotechnology .
There is intense scientific interest in its properties .
Understanding the behavior of magnetite is difficult because the strong interaction among its electrons complicates its electronic structure and magnetic properties . ”
To study the mineral , the researchers developed and applied a novel technique , called X - ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism ( XMCD ) at the Advanced Photon Source , a high - energy synchrotron facility .
The technique uses high - brilliance circularly polarized X - rays to probe the magnetic state of magnetite as a diamond anvil cell subjects a sample to many hundreds of thousands of atmospheres .
The researchers combined their experimental results with theoretical calculations by collaborators to pinpoint why the magnetic strength changes .
The study , to be published in February in Physical Review Letters , reveals the electron - spin configuration in the iron sites of the mineral to be the origin of the phenomenon .
This discovery not only shows the profound effects of pressure on magnetism , it also discloses , for the first time , that pressure induced a spin pairing transition that results in changes in the electron mobility and structure .
“ The discovery is important , ” Ding said .
“ It advances our understanding of the correlation of magnetism , electron transport , and structural stability in materials with strong electron interactions , like magnetite . ”

SilentPatriot first called our attention to this yesterday and we just could n't figure this out .
At a Vets for Freedom rally outside on the Capitol steps , VFF Vice Chairman and Iraq vet SSgt David Bellavia introduced John McCain to speak to the veterans before he joined the Senate Armed Services hearing with Petraeus and Crocker .
Bellavia took the opportunity to apparently try to take a shot at Obama :
Rest assured , that men like Sen.
McCain will be the goal and the men that my two young boys will emulate and admire . [ sic ]
You can have your Tiger Woods , we ’ve got Sen. McCain . [..]
My friends , this is the real ‘ audacity of hope . ’
Download Download
The only thing that SilentPatriot and I could come up with is that it's a vaguely racial comment , although it 's unclear how being multi-racial ( which both Woods and Obama are ) is somehow a bad thing .
Guest Michael Eric
Dyson is n't sure the intent , but thinks that any way you slice it , it does n't reflect well on Bellavia , nor McCain , who did not react to the statement at all :
DYSON : Now we ca n’t discern the person ’s intent , it may have been fine .
But that ’s even more problematic .
If there was no specific and particular and conscious intent to do harm , that means that this grows out of a pattern of habit .
That it is just a natural reflex .
And that one , you know , interchangeable African - American multi-racial person is as good as the other or they ’re indistinguishable .
Kind of like how those Sunnis and Shi'as are indistinguishable , right , McCain ?
But the thing I kept coming back to is that as an insult , it clearly backfires onto McCain , given the stature and achievements of Tiger Woods , something that Keith Olbermann states perfectly :
Since I first heard this today , I ’ve been trying to figure out , with some sports background in my past , if the veteran there was not talking about race , what he could have been talking about .
Because what is there to be dismissive about about Tiger Woods ?
He ’s an almost unbeatable golfer .
He is , in fact , the man who re-calibrated what had been a very non-diverse sport and because of that re-calibration , everybody in it made a lot more money than they would have otherwise .
He brought people a lot of green , never mind any other color .
If you ’re comparing anybody to Tiger Woods on a non-racial basis , the other guy loses , does n’t he ?
Well , here 's hoping , Keith .
I just think it 's hilarious that the GOP proves once again to be so incompetent that they even screw up insults .
One of India 's best - known public health specialists and human rights activists , Dr Binayak Sen , has now spent a year in an Indian prison .
He is accused of links with Maoist rebels in Chhattisgarh , one of India 's poorest states where the rebels have a strong presence .
The doctor denies the charge .
During a court appearance earlier this year , Dr Sen said he did not support the Maoists .
" If they arrest people like me , human rights workers will have no locus standi .
I have never condoned Maoist violence .
It is an invalid and unsustainable movement , " he told Tehelka magazine .
' Real grievances '
At the same time , Dr Sen has maintained the Maoists have tapped into a groundswell of legitimate grievances .
We also wish to express grave concern that Dr Sen appears to be incarcerated solely for peacefully exercising his fundamental human rights
Nobel laureates ' letter " The grievances [ of the people ] are real .
There is an ongoing famine in the region .
Forty per cent of the country lives with malnutrition , " he said .
The Maoists say they are fighting their long - running insurgency for the rights of landless farmers and tribes .
Dr Sen , a trained paediatrician , was working with poor tribal people in Chhattisgarh , when he was detained last year .
He was also a senior member of the local unit of a leading Indian human rights group , the People 's Union for Civil Liberties .
He ran a weekly clinic for the local tribals and was piloting a community - based health programme in the state .
Rights groups , intellectuals and more than 2,000 doctors from all over the world have signed petitions demanding Dr Sen 's release .
They include prominent American writer Noam Chomsky .
The clamour for his release increased this week when 22 Nobel laureates joined the campaign and urged the Indian government to release the jailed activist .

Last month , Dr Sen was awarded the prestigious Jonathan Mann Award for Global Health and Human Rights for his services to poor and tribal communities and his unwavering commitment to civil liberties and human rights .
Dr Sen , 56 , trained in medicine and paediatrics at India 's prestigious Christian Medical College in Vellore and picked up a gold medal for his efforts .
Later specialising in social medicine and community health , he moved to Chhattisgarh in 1981 , and began working with the leading mine workers ' trade union leader , Shankar Guha Niyogi .
Pioneering hospital
The two set up a hospital for mine workers after raising money from the community - the Shaheed Hospital in Dallirajhara is still cited as an example of a pioneering health initiative in India for the poor .
The doctor received a paltry salary of 600 rupees ( $ 15 ) a month , and helped the facility grow from a small clinic to a 60 - bed hospital in four years .
In the early 1990s , Dr Sen and his wife , Ilina , set up Rupantar , a non-governmental organisation training rural health workers , running mobile clinics and campaigns against alcohol abuse and violence against women .
Dr Sen 's efforts in public health programmes , say local doctors , helped bringing down the infant mortality rate in the state and deaths caused by diarrhoea and dehydration .
Dr Sen has been outspoken about the ways the government is trying to tackle the Maoists in Chhattisgarh by backing a controversial civil militia of local tribals called Salwa Judum .
" The Salwa Judum , " he said recently , " has created a dangerous split in the tribal community . "
He has also expressed his deep concern over rising inequality in India despite the economic boom .
" We have to strive for more inclusive growth .
You cannot create two categories of people , " he told a journalist .
" There is a Malthusian process of exclusion going on in the country .
Everybody must wake up to this , otherwise soon it will be too late . "
His wife , Ilina , says the fight to release her husband goes beyond the man himself .
" I realise this goes beyond Binayak and my family .
We are part of a much larger fight .
We are struggling for the right to dissent peacefully .
Our commitment to that gives me strength . "

The popular belief that we ’ve become a nation , and an industrialized world , of increasingly sedentary sloths has become so widespread , that research to the contrary travels slow ... if it even makes it out of the medical journals at all .
A new study using the latest scientific measuring tool of physical activity energy expenditure , the doubly labeled water method , compiled the largest collection of international data going back to the 1980s .
Guess what it found ?
You can probably guess simply by the fact that this extensive study barely made a blip on the news .
Most readers probably heard nothing about it .
Researchers from Maastricht University in The Netherlands and the University of Aberdeen in Scotland found that actual measures of energy expenditure of adults in the United States and Europe show no evidence of a decline over time .
“ It seems that we have been misled by the anecdotal information about levels of our physical activity , ” said co-author , professor John Speakman .
Daily physical activity has n’t changed , he said .
“ In the time we spend watching television today , people probably listened to radio in the 1950s and read books in the 1920s . ”
Researchers have used many different methods to measure the physical activity and fitness levels of children and adults through the decades .
While each one has shown we ’re no less active or fit today , this is the first study to examine research data on what some consider especially controlled , the doubly labeled water method ( DLW ) .
This complicated study was just published in the online issue of the International Journal of Obesity .
For this study , the researchers collected information from four sources .
The first was from the town of Maastricht , which between 1983 and 2005 has measured energy expenditure in 366 free - living adults , using DLW and direct measures of their basal energy expenditure by respirometry .
This single site data was consistently gathered and well - controlled , allowing a reliable look at changes over the decades .
The second source of information in this paper was original DLW data from 13 North America studies of 393 people ( 85 % women , ethnically diverse , and across a large geographic area ) published in peer - reviewed journals between 1982 and 2005 .
To ensure that the DLW data was reliable and representative of adults in the general population , they included information on people who were healthy , not pregnant , and not part of diet or physical activity interventions .
Third , to compare modern data with underdeveloped countries more likely to reflect energy expenditure before modernization of our travel and lifestyles , they gathered DLW data from rural third world cultures .
Finally , in order to evaluate any reductions in energy expenditure compared to what would be naturally expected for bodies of the same size , they compiled DLW data for mammals living in the wild .
[ They recognized that the data on wild animals used a different statistical model ( single - pool ) than in the human calculations , which would slightly overestimate the predicted energy demands . ]
This may not sound like impressive numbers of subjects , but it will when you realize what ’s involved in this method and that this study compiled virtually all such data available to date .
The DLW method is the first noninvasive method for measuring the energy expended by people over a period of 2 to 3 weeks in their normal , real - life activities .
It was invented by professor Nathan Lifson and colleagues at the University of Minnesota in the 1940s after discovering that the oxygen in respired carbon dioxide is in isotopic equilibrium with the oxygen in body water .
It was an expensive high - tech method that for years was mostly used small birds and animals until isotopes became more cost - effective and gas isotope ratio mass spectrometers became commercially available .
DLW was n’t used in human until the early 1980s and it ’s been increasingly refined over the years .
It ’s an intricate method .
The authors described the Maastricht protocol in their study [ * see below ] , as well as the different ways that the data on basal energy expenditure and daily energy expenditure can be statistically used to determine physical activity level for people of different body masses .
They used all three calculation methods in this study .
More detailed information on DLW is found in the IDECG ( International Dietary Energy Consultancy Group ) working group consensus report from Vienna .
While there are complex issues surrounding this method beyond the scope of this post , the bottom line is that the method has been validated in more than a dozen studies by four independent research groups and shown to be valid , with an accuracy around 1 - 3 % and precision of 2 - 8 % , for a range of activity levels of people in daily life .
Researchers at the University of Chicago , for instance , found it reliable for measuring daily energy expenditure among women within a 7.8 % variation .
The findings
Among the Maastricht people , the researchers found that the energy they expended in physical activity each day slightly increased over the decades .
The calculated calories people burned in physical activity showed no significant changes between 1988 to 2006 .
The amount of energy individuals expend in physical activity varies by age , gender and body size , of course , but there was no difference over the decades .
A correlation that puzzled the authors was that during these same decades , ‘ obesity ’ rates in the Netherlands doubled from 5 to 10 % .
Among the DLW data from North America , activity increased over the decades and the daily energy people expended in activity rose .
Again , this was while ‘ obesity ’ rates increased from 8 to 22 % .
Despite popular beliefs that our modern , Western lifestyles has turned us into slugs , the overall DLW data from third world , nonindustrialized peoples was similar to those of people from Maastricht and North America .
The energy expended by modern people in Westernized societies is completely in line with people in third world countries , the authors concluded .
Finally , using the animal data to predict what daily energy demands would be for modern humans of similar size , they found that people were expending more energy than predicted .
None of the values was lower than predicted based on body mass and living temperature .
In each group of humans and animals and using each mathematical method , the total physical activity levels for size and gender were amazingly similar .
Conclusion and body of evidence to date
The authors concluded that , using a variety of different techniques to analyze the date on daily and basal energy expenditures of people since the 1980s , this study found no indication that physical activity has declined in North America or Europe .
In fact , the trends “ were actually in the opposite direction , suggesting levels of activity energy expenditure may have actually increased over this time interval , ” the authors concluded .
These findings are at odds with anecdotal reports , as they went on to talk about .
When people observe ‘ obese ’ people seeming to be less physically active than their lean counterparts , this observation is popularly misunderstood .
Although ‘ obese ’ people may appear to do less physical activity , they are actually expending more energy , said the authors , and can be more fit than their thinner counterparts .
These findings have been confirmed in numerous studies , using a variety of methodologies .
For example , although not mentioned in this paper , this lead author has conducted some especially relevant research .
Several years ago , Dr. Klaas R. Westerterp had specifically studied the physical activity among ‘ obese ’ people using DLW measurements .
The results were published in the International Journal of Obesity .
He found “ activity associated energy expenditure increases with body mass index ” even while physical activity level does n’t change .
He also found that “ the majority of ‘ obese ’ subjects are moderately active . ”
Most fat people are not sedentary , as is popularly believed .
However , increasing activity among the ‘ obese ’ is “ not rewarded by weight loss , ” he found .
And higher intensity exercise and training programs are not tolerated without raising risks for them .
A more recent study by pediatric researchers at Maastricht University compared daily energy expenditure among teens of differing sizes and body fat in The Netherlands , Britain and America .
They found that the basal metabolic rate and the average daily metabolic rate are higher among the fat teens as compared to lean ones .
Their basal metabolic rates remain higher even when adjusting for age , the percentage of body fat and gender , and fat teens proved actually to be equally active as lean teens .
Deja vu
As has already been covered , the carefully worded admonishments of government agencies and stakeholders in exercise can mislead us to believe in sloths .
Definitions are everything .
But the research and conclusions of experts that counter popular anecdotes rarely make the news .
Michael Gard , a physical and health educator at Charles Stuart University ’s Bathurst campus dispelled the belief that kids today are sedentary and explained our lack of understanding of children ’s physiology that attempts to put adult measures and exercise solutions on kids .
Despite popular notions of kids being shuttled around in cars and spending their days plopped in front of a screen , children ’s play experiences and the amount of physical activity they derive from it and walking and biking , also appear to have changed very little since the 1940s .
Research led by Colin Pooley , Ph.D. at Lancaster University in England , followed over 895,000 individual trips and collected 160 hours of taped interviews and data among four age groups of children and found that walking still accounted for about two - thirds of their means of transport and that their actual movements and play activities had changed very little in the past 60 years , despite greater affluence , media and car ownership .
Nor is the physical fitness of kids in the toilet , as popular anecdotes tell us .
A review of U.S. studies examining actual peak oxygen consumption measurements indicated that there has been little change in absolute and relative peak V - O2 levels in children from the 1930s through the 1990s .
A review of the evidence for children ’s physical activity in the U.S. and internationally , conducted by Adelaide , Australian researchers , concluded that overall , the data does not support the view that today ’s generation of young people is less active .
Overall population survey data shows little , if any , change for decades .
But trend data also suggests dramatic increases since the 1960s in extracurricular sports and physical activities , according to a recent review by researchers at the Division of Epidemiology , School of Public Health , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis .
The most recent Child Trends Data from the U.S. Department of Education , National Center for Education Statistics , reported that although socioeconomic disparities were evident , between 2001 and 2005 , the percentage of students participating in after - school sports has increased to the highest levels ever .
Examining the telly tubby myths and popular assumptions of an obesogenic environment and calls for more physical education for kids , found no relationship between sedentary or physical activities and ‘ obesity ’ .
“ Yes , children today are surrounded by an array of new and exciting forms of technology , but they have not , as a group , become morally degenerate overnight , ” wrote professor Gard .
The government ’s own evidence does n’t support fears that we ’re a nation of couch potatoes or that sedentary behaviors are a new public health crisis .
The latest Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS ) survey data defused the myth of sloth , showing that activity levels increased between years 2001 and 2005 to 49.7 % and 46.7 % among men and women , respectively .
Previous BFRSS surveys had reported that 31.5 % of Americans were supposedly inactive in 1989 .
The National Health Interview Surveys from the CDC ’s National Center for Health Statistics , which asks slightly different questions , has also shown that the numbers of us getting regular physical activity rose from 1998 to 2005 .
Continued findings that dispel popular beliefs of obesity leave people , including the authors of this latest study , perplexed and tempted to speculate about the cause of the obesity epidemic using another set of anecdotes , rather than consider the more obvious : if they are even asking the right question .

The Democrats are doing everything they can to blow this presidential election .
This is a skill that comes naturally to the party .
There is no such thing as a can ’t - miss year for the Democrats .
They are truly gifted at finding ways to lose .
Jimmy Carter managed to win the White House in 1976 by looking pious and riding a wave of anti-Watergate revulsion .
After four hapless years , he dutifully handed the keys back to the G.O.P .
Bill Clinton tried hard to lose , with sex scandals and whatnot , during the 1992 campaign .
But Ross Perot would n’t let him .
Mr. Clinton won with a piddling 43 percent of the vote .
For eight years , Mr. Clinton tried to throw the presidency away ( with sex scandals and whatnot ) , but he was never able to succeed .
That ’s been it for the party for the past 40 years .
The Democrats have become so psychologically battered by these many decades in the leadership wilderness that they consider the Clinton years , during which the president was impeached and they lost control of both houses of Congress , to have been a period of triumph .
ST PETERSBURG , Russia ( Reuters ) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev blamed “ aggressive ” United States policies on Saturday for the global financial crisis and said Moscow ’s growing economic muscle could be part of the solution .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev speaks at the St Petersburg Economic Forum June 7 , 2008 .
Medvedev said on Saturday the United States was not strong enough to solve the world financial crisis alone and offered to convene a global conference in Moscow to tackle the issue .

“ Failure by the biggest financial firms in the world to adequately take risk into account , coupled with the aggressive financial policies of the biggest economy in the world , have led not only to corporate losses , ” Medvedev told Russia ’s main annual event for international investors in St Petersburg .
“ Most people on the planet have become poorer . ”
The Kremlin leader said investment by cash - rich Russian companies abroad , promotion of Moscow as a major financial centre and use of the ruble as a reserve currency were part of the answer .
These could help solve problems created by what he said was a gap between the United States ’ leading global economic role and “ its true capabilities ” .
The Kremlin leader said economic nationalism had played a big part in triggering the current crisis , which he compared to the Great Depression of the 1930s .
“ No matter how big the American market and no matter how strong the American financial system , they are incapable of substituting for global commodity and financial markets , ” Medvedev told the St Petersburg International Economic Forum .
The Kremlin leader also attacked big bonuses paid out in the financial world , saying regulators needed to ensure that incentives promoted “ rational behavior based on a balanced evaluation of risks and rewards ” .
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez , who spoke shortly after Medvedev , appeared to reject the criticism .
He said the United States had never based its policies on “ economic egoism ” and believed in free trade .
“ Globalization is in the national interest , ” he added .
Medvedev said Russia , now in the 10th year of an economic boom fuelled by soaring prices for its oil and gas exports , was in an ideal position to help solve the world financial crisis since it did not share the problems of other leading economies .
“ Russia is now a global player and understands its role in
supporting the global community , ” the president added .
“ I propose holding a representative international conference involving the heads of the biggest financial companies and leading financial analysts ... as early as this year , ” the Kremlin chief said .
“ Such a platform could become a permanent one ” .
The Kremlin has encouraged Russian companies , which are flush with cash from high commodity and oil prices , to invest more actively abroad but this has caused alarm in Western nations , which are traditionally suspicious of Moscow ’s intentions .
Medvedev said other countries had nothing to fear from Russian investment in their companies since it was “ neither speculative nor aggressive ” but purely based on pragmatism .
Sworn in last month as president , the Russian leader said world institutions had been unable so far to cope with the challenges from volatility on world markets , including soaring commodity and food prices .
With its past as a leading global wheat producer , Russia was ready for “ constructive joint action ” to overcome the food problem , he said .
Moscow could also help with another problem -- a lack of liquid investable assets because of disappointment with the U.S. dollar .
Russia would soon adopt a plan to become a global financial centre and make the ruble a regional reserve currency , Medvedev said .
The Russian leader said that recent Kremlin moves to liberalize the domestic gas market and reduce taxes on the oil sector would help stabilize global energy markets .
Russia is the world ’s biggest gas producer and its second - biggest oil exporter .

Afterword By Justin Raimondo .
Businessmen or manufacturers can either be genuine free enterprisers or statists ; they can either make their way on the free market or seek special government favors and privileges .
They choose according to their individual preferences and values .
But bankers are inherently inclined toward statism .
Commercial bankers , engaged as they are in unsound fractional reserve credit , are , in the free market , always teetering on the edge of bankruptcy .
Hence they are always reaching for government aid and bailout .
Investment bankers do much of their business underwriting government bonds , in the United States and abroad .
Therefore , they have a vested interest in promoting deficits and in forcing taxpayers to redeem government debt .
Both sets of bankers , then , tend to be tied in with government policy , and try to influence and control government actions in domestic and foreign affairs .
In the early years of the 19th century , the organized capital market in the United States was largely confined to government bonds ( then called “ stocks ” ) , along with canal companies and banks themselves .
Whatever investment banking existed was therefore concentrated in government debt .
From the Civil War until the 1890s , there were virtually no manufacturing corporations ; manufacturing and other businesses were partnerships and had not yet reached the size where they needed to adopt the corporate form .
The only exception was railroads , the biggest industry in the U.S.
The first investment banks , therefore , were concentrated in railroad securities and government bonds .
The first major investment - banking house in the United States was a creature of government privilege .
Jay Cooke , an Ohio - born business promoter living in Philadelphia , and his brother Henry , editor of the leading Republican newspaper in Ohio , were close friends of Ohio U.S. Senator Salmon P. Chase .
When the new Lincoln Administration took over in 1861 , the Cookes lobbied hard to secure Chase the appointment of Secretary of the Treasury .
That lobbying , plus the then enormous sum of $ 100,000 that Jay Cooke poured into Chase ’s political coffers , induced Chase to return the favor by granting Cooke , newly set up as an investment banker , an enormously lucrative monopoly in underwriting the entire federal debt .
Cooke and Chase then managed to use the virtual Republican monopoly in Congress during the war to transform the American commercial banking system from a relatively free market to a National Banking System centralized by the federal government under Wall Street control .
A crucial aspect of that system was that national banks could only expand credit in proportion to the federal bonds they owned – bonds which they were forced to buy from Jay Cooke .
Jay Cooke & Co. proved enormously influential in the post - war Republican administrations , which continued their monopoly in under - writing government bonds .
The House of Cooke met its well - deserved fate by going bankrupt in the Panic of 1874 , a failure helped along by its great rival , the then Philadelphia - based Drexel , Morgan & Co .
J.P. Morgan
After 1873 , Drexel , Morgan and its dominant figure J.P. Morgan became by far the leading investment firm in the U.S. If Cooke had been a “ Republican ” bank , Morgan , while prudently well connected in both parties , was chiefly influential among the Democrats .
The other great financial interest powerful in the Democratic Party was the mighty European investment - banking house of the Rothschilds , whose agent , August Belmont , was treasurer of the national Democratic party for many years .
The enormous influence of the Morgans on the Democratic administrations of Grover Cleveland ( 1884–88 , 1892–96 ) may be seen by simply glancing at their leading personnel .
Grover Cleveland himself spent virtually all his life in the Morgan ambit .
He grew up in Buffalo as a railroad lawyer , one of his major clients being the Morgan - dominated New York Central Railroad .
In between administrations , he became a partner of the powerful New York City law firm of Bangs , Stetson , Tracey , and MacVeagh .
This firm , by the late 1880s , had become the chief legal firm of the House of Morgan , largely because senior partner Charles B. Tracey was J.P. Morgan ’s brother - in - law .
After Tracey died in 1887 , Francis Lynde Stetson , an old and close friend of Cleveland ’s , became the firm ’s dominant partner , as well as the personal attorney for J.P. Morgan .
( This is now the Wall St. firm of Davis , Polk , and Wardwell . )
Grover Cleveland ’s cabinets were honeycombed with Morgan men , with an occasional bow to other bankers .
Considering those officials most concerned with foreign policy , his first Secretary of State , Thomas F. Bayard , was a close ally and disciple of August Belmont ; indeed , Belmont ’s son , Perry , had lived with and worked for Bayard in Congress as his top aide .
The dominant Secretary of State in the second Cleveland Administration was the powerful Richard Olney , a leading lawyer for Boston financial interests , who have always been tied in with the Morgans , and in particular was on the Board of the Morgan - run Boston and Maine Railroad , and would later help Morgan organize the General Electric Company .
The War and Navy departments under Cleveland were equally banker - dominated .
Boston Brahmin Secretary of War William C. Endicott had married into the wealthy Peabody family .
Endicott ’s wife ’s uncle , George Peabody , had established a banking firm which included J.P. Morgan ’s father as a senior partner ; and a Peabody had been best man at J.P. ’s wedding .
Secretary of the Navy was leading New York City financier William C. Whitney , a close friend and top political advisor of Cleveland ’s .
Whitney was closely allied with the Morgans in running the New York Central Railroad .
Secretary of War in the second Cleveland Administration was an old friend and aide of Cleveland ’s , Daniel S. Lamont , previously an employee and protégé of William C. Whitney .
Finally , the second Secretary of the Navy was an Alabama Congressman , Hilary A. Herbert , an attorney for and very close friend of Mayer Lehman , a founding partner of the New York mercantile firm of Lehman Brothers , soon to move heavily into investment banking .
Indeed , Mayer ’s son , Herbert , later to be Governor of New York during the New Deal , was named after Hilary Herbert .
The great turning point of American foreign policy came in the early 1890s , during the second Cleveland Administration .
It was then that the U.S. turned sharply and permanently from a foreign policy of peace and non-intervention to an aggressive program of economic and political expansion abroad .
At the heart of the new policy were America ’s leading bankers , eager to use the country ’s growing economic strength to subsidize and force - feed export markets and investment outlets that they would finance , as well as to guarantee Third World government bonds .
The major focus of aggressive expansion in the 1890s was Latin America , and the principal Enemy to be dislodged was Great Britain , which had dominated foreign investments in that vast region .
In a notable series of articles in 1894 , Bankers ’ Magazine set the agenda for the remainder of the decade .
Its conclusion : if “ we could wrest the South American markets from Germany and England and permanently hold them , this would be indeed a conquest worth perhaps a heavy sacrifice . ”
Long - time Morgan associate Richard Olney heeded the call , as Secretary of State from 1895 to 1897 , setting the U.S. on the road to Empire .
After leaving the State Department , he publicly summarized the policy he had pursued .
The old isolationism heralded by George Washington ’s Farewell Address is over , he thundered .
The time has now arrived , Olney declared , when “ it behooves us to accept the commanding position … among the Power of the earth . ”
And , “ the present crying need of our commercial interests , ” he added , “ is more markets and larger markets ” for American products , especially in Latin America .
Good as their word , Cleveland and Olney proceeded belligerently to use U.S. might to push Great Britain out of its markets and footholds in Latin America .
In 1894 , the United States Navy illegally used force to break the blockade of Rio de Janeiro by a British - backed rebellion aiming to restore the Brazilian monarchy .
To insure that the rebellion was broken , the U.S. Navy stationed war - ships in Rio harbor for several months .
During the same period , the U.S. government faced a complicated situation in Nicaragua , where it was planning to guarantee the bonds of the American Maritime Canal Company , to build a canal across the country .
The new regime of General Zelaya was threatening to revoke this canal concession ; at the same time , an independent reservation , of Mosquito Indians , protected for decades by Great Britain , sat athwart the eastern end of the proposed canal .
In a series of deft maneuvers , using the Navy and landing the Marines , the U.S. managed to bring Zelaya to heel and to oust the British and take over the Mosquito territory .
In Santo Domingo ( now the Dominican Republic ) France was the recipient of the American big stick .
In the Santo Domingo Improvement Company , in 1893 , a consortium of New York bankers purchased the entire debt of Santo Domingo from a Dutch company , receiving the right to collect all Dominican customs revenues in payment of the debt .
The French became edgy the following year when a French citizen was murdered in that country , and the French government threatened to use force to obtain reparations .
Its target for reparations was the Dominican customs revenue , at which point the U.S. sent a warship to the area to intimidate the French .
But the most alarming crisis of this period took place in 1895 – 96 , when the U.S. was at a hair ’s breadth from actual war with Great Britain over a territorial dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana .
This boundary dispute had been raging for forty years , but Venezuela shrewdly attracted American interest by granting concessions to Americans in gold fields in the disputed area .
Apparently , Cleveland had had enough of the “ British threat , ” and he moved quickly toward war .
His close friend Don Dickinson , head of the Michigan Democratic Party , delivered a bellicose speech in May 1895 as a surrogate for the President .
Wars are inevitable , Dickinson declared , for they arise out of commercial competition between nations .
The United States faces the danger of numerous conflicts , and clearly the enemy was Great Britain .
After reviewing the history of the alleged British threat , Dickinson thundered that “ we need and must have open markets throughout the world to maintain and increase our prosperity . ”
In July , Secretary of State Olney sent the British an insulting and tub - thumping note , declaring that “ the United States is practically sovereign on this continent , and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition . ”
President Cleveland , angry at the British rejection of the note , delivered a virtual war message to Congress in December , but Britain , newly occupied in problems with the Boers in South Africa , decided to yield and agree to a compromise boundary settlement .
Insultingly , the Venezuelans received not a single seat on the agreed - upon arbitration commission .
In effect , the British , occupied elsewhere , had ceded dominance to the United States in Latin America .
It was time for the U.S. to find more enemies to challenge .
The next , and greatest , Latin American intervention was of course in Cuba , where a Republican Administration entered the war goaded by its jingo wing closely allied to the Morgan interests , led by young Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt and by his powerful Boston Brahmin mentor , Senator Henry Cabot Lodge .
But American intervention in Cuba had begun in the Cleveland - Olney regime .
In February 1895 , a rebellion for Cuban independence broke out against Spain .
The original U.S. response was to try to end the threat of revolutionary war to American property interests by siding with Spanish rule modified by autonomy to the Cubans to pacify their desires for independence .
Here was the harbinger of U.S. foreign policy ever since : to try to maneuver in Third World countries to sponsor “ third force ” or “ moderate ” interests which do not really exist .
The great proponent of this policy was the millionaire sugar grower in Cuba , Edwin F. Atkins , a close friend of fellow - Bostonian Richard Olney , and a partner of J.P. Morgan and Company .
By the fall of 1895 , Olney concluded that Spain could not win , and that , in view of the “ large and important commerce between the two countries ” and the “ large amounts of American capital ” in Cuba , the U.S. should execute a 180 - degree shift and back the rebels , even unto recognizing Cuban independence .
The fact that such recognition would certainly lead to war with Spain did not seem worth noting .
The road to war with Spain had begun , a road that would reach its logical conclusion three years later .
Ardently backing the pro-war course was Edwin F. Atkins , and August Belmont , on behalf of the Rothschild banking interests .
The House ’ of Rothschild , which had been long - time financiers to Spain , refused to extend any further credit to Spain , and instead under - wrote Cuban Revolutionary bond issues , and even assumed full obligation for the unsubscribed balance .
During the conquest of Cuba in the Spanish - American War , the United States also took the occasion to expand its power greatly in Asia , seizing first the port of Manila and then all of the Philippines , after which it spent several years crushing the revolutionary forces of the Philippine independence movement .
An Aggressive Asian Policy
The late 1890s also saw a new turn in the United States ’ attitude toward the Far East .
Expanding rapidly into the Pacific in pursuit of economic and financial gain , the U.S. government saw that Russia , Germany , and France had been carving up increasing territorial and economic concessions in the near corpse of the Chinese imperial dynasty .
Coming late in the imperial game of Asia , and not willing to risk large - scale expenditure of troops , the U.S. , led by Olney and continued by the Republicans , decided to link up with Great Britain .
The two countries would then use the Japanese to provide the shock troops that would roll back Russia and Germany and parcel out imperial benefits to both of her faraway allies , in a division of spoils known euphemistically as the “ Open Door . ”
With Britain leaving the field free to the U.S. in Latin America , the U.S. could afford to link arms in friendly fashion with Britain in the Far East .
A major impetus toward a more aggressive policy in Asia was provided by the lure of railroad concessions .
Lobbying heavily for railroad concessions was the American China Development Company , organized in 1895 , and consisting of a consortium of the top financial interests in the U.S. , including James Stillman of the then Rockefeller - controlled National City Bank ; Charles Coster , railroad expert of J.P. Morgan and Co. ; Jacob Schiff , head of the New York investment bank of Kuhn , Loeb and Co. ; and Edward H. Harriman , railroad magnate .
Olney and the State Department pressed China hard for concessions to the ACDC for a Peking - Hankow Railway and for a railway across Manchuria , but in both cases the American syndicate was blocked .
Russia pressured China successfully to grant that country the right to build a Manchurian railway ; and a Belgian syndicate , backed by France and Russia , won the Peking - Hankow concession from China .
It was time for sterner measures .
The attorney for the ACDC set up the Committee on American Interests in China , which soon transformed itself into the American Asiatic Association , dedicated to a more aggressive American policy on behalf of economic interests in China .
After helping the European powers suppress the nationalist Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 , the U.S. also helped push Russian troops out of Manchuria .
Finally , in 1904 , President Theodore Roosevelt egged Japan on to attack Russia , and Japan succeeded in driving Russia out of Manchuria and ending Russia ’s economic concessions .
Roosevelt readily acceded to Japan ’s resulting dominance in Korea and Manchuria , hoping that Japan would also protect American economic interests in the area .
Theodore Roosevelt had been a Morgan man from the beginning of his career .
His father and uncle were both Wall Street bankers , both of them closely associated with various Morgan - dominated railroads .
Roosevelt ’s first cousin and major financial adviser , W. Emlen Roosevelt , was on the board of several New York banks , including the Astor National Bank , the president of which was George F. Baker , close friend and ally of J.P. Morgan and head of Morgan ’s flagship commercial bank , the First National Bank of New York . ’
At Harvard , furthermore , young Theodore married Alice Lee , daughter of George Cabot Lee , and related to the top Boston Brahmin families .
Kinsman Henry Cabot Lodge soon became T.R. ’s long - time political mentor .
Throughout the 19th century , the Republicans had been mainly a high - tariff , inflationist party , while the Democrats had been the party of free trade and hard money , i.e. , the gold standard .
In 1896 , however , the radical inflationist forces headed by William Jennings Bryan captured the Democratic presidential nomination , and so the Morgans , previously dominant in the Democratic Party , sent a message to the Republican nominee , William McKinley , through Henry Cabot Lodge .
Lodge stated that the Morgan interests would back McKinley provided that the Republicans would support the gold standard .
The deal was struck .
William McKinley reflected the dominance of the Republican Party by the Rockefeller / Standard Oil interests .
Standard Oil was originally headquartered at Rockefeller ’s home in Cleveland , and the oil magnate had long had a commanding influence in Ohio Republican politics .
In the early 1890s , Marcus Hanna , industrialist and high school chum of John D. Rockefeller , banded together with Rockefeller and other financiers to save McKinley from bankruptcy , and Hanna became McKinley ’s top political adviser and chairman of the Republican National Committee .
As a consolation prize to the Morgan interests for McKinley ’s capture of the Republican nomination , Morgan man Garret A. Hobart , director of various Morgan companies , including the Liberty National Bank of New York City , became Vice - President .
The death of Hobart in 1899 left a “ Morgan vacancy ” in the Vice - Presidential spot , as McKinley walked into the nomination .
McKinley and Hanna were both hostile to Roosevelt , considering him “ erratic ” and a “ Madman , ” but after several Morgan men turned down the nomination , and after the intensive lobbying of Morgan partner George W. Perkins , Teddy Roosevelt at last received the Vice - Presidential nomination .
It is not surprising that virtually Teddy ’s first act after the election of 1900 was to throw a lavish dinner in honor of J.P. Morgan .
Teddy Roosevelt and the “ Lone Nut ”
The sudden appearance of one of the “ lone nuts ” so common in American political history led to the assassination of McKinley , and suddenly Morgan man Theodore Roosevelt was President .
John Hay , expansionist Secretary of State whom Roosevelt inherited from McKinley , had the good fortune of having his daughter marry the son of William C. Whitney of the great Morgan - connected family .
TR ’s next Secretary of State and former Secretary of War was his old friend Elihu Root , personal attorney for J.P. Morgan .
Root appointed as his Assistant Secretary a close friend of TR’s , Robert Bacon , a Morgan partner , and in due course Bacon became TR ’s Secretary of State .
TR ’s first appointed Secretary of the Navy was Paul Morton , vice - president of the Morgan - controlled Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad , and his Assistant Secretary was Herbert L. Satterlee , who had the distinction of being J.P. Morgan ’s son - in - law .
Theodore Roosevelt ’s greatest direct boost to the Morgan interests is little known .
It is well known that Roosevelt engineered a phony revolution in Columbia in 1903 , creating the new state of Panama and handing the Canal Zone to the United States .
What has not been fully disclosed is who benefited from the $ 40 million that the U.S. government paid , as part of the Panama settlement , to the owners of the old bankrupt Panama Canal Company , a French company which had previously been granted a Colombian concession to dig a Panama canal .
The Panama Canal Company ’s lobbyist , Morgan - connected New York attorney William Nelson Cromwell , literally sat in the White House directing the “ revolution ” and organizing the final settlement .
We now know that , in 1900 , the shares of the old French Panama Canal Company were purchased by an American financial syndicate , headed by J.P. Morgan & Co. , and put together by Morgan ’s top attorney , Francis Lynde Stetson .
The syndicate also included members of the Rockefeller , Seligman , and Kuhn , Loeb financial groups , as well as Perkins and Saterlee .
The syndicate did well from the Panama revolution , purchasing the shares at two - thirds of par and selling them , after the revolution , for double the price .
One member of the syndicate was especially fortunate : Teddy Roosevelt ’s brother - in - law , Douglas E. Robinson , a director of Morgan ’s Astor National Bank .
For William Cromwell was named the fiscal agent of the new Republic of Panama , and Cromwell promptly put $ 6 million of the $ 10 million payoff the U.S. made to the Panamanian revolutionaries into New York City mortgages via the real estate firm of the same Douglas E. Robinson .
After the turn of the century , a savage economic and political war developed between the Morgan interests on the one hand , and the allied Harriman - Kuhn , Loeb - Rockefeller interests on the other .
Harriman and Kuhn , Loeb grabbed control of the Union Pacific Railroad and the two titanic forces battled to a draw for control of the Northern Pacific .
Also , at about the same time , a long - lasting and world - wide financial and political “ oil war ” broke out between Standard Oil , previously a monopolist in both the crude and export markets outside of the U.S. , and the burgeoning British Royal Dutch Shell–Rothschild combine .
And since the Morgans and Rothschilds were longtime allies , it is certainly sensible to conclude – though there are no hard facts to prove it – that Teddy Roosevelt launched his savage anti-trust assault to break Standard Oil as a Morgan contribution to the worldwide struggle .
Furthermore , Mellon - owned Gulf Oil was allied to the Shell combine , and this might well explain the fact that former Morgan - and - Mellon lawyer Philander Knox , TR ’s Attorney - General , was happy to file the suit against Standard Oil .
Roosevelt ’s successor , William Howard Taft , being an Ohio Republican , was allied to the Rockefeller camp , and so he proceeded to take vengeance on the Morgans by filing anti-trust suits to break up the two leading Morgan trusts , International Harvester and United States Steel .
It was now all - out war , and so the Morgans in 1912 deliberately created a new party , the Progressive Party , headed by former Morgan partner , George W. Perkins .
The successful aim of the Progressive Party was to bring Theodore Roosevelt out of retirement to run for President , in order to break Taft , and to elect , for the first time in a generation , a Democratic President .
The new party was liquidated soon after .
Supporters of Roosevelt were studded with financiers in the Morgan ambit , including Judge Elbert Gary , chairman of the board of U.S. Steel ; Medill McCormick of the International Harvester family , and Willard Straight , Morgan ’s partner .
In the same year , Straight and his heiress wife , Dorothy Whitney , founded the weekly magazine of opinion , The New Republic , symbolizing the growing alliance for war and statism between the Morgans and various of the more moderate ( i.e. , non-Marxist ) progressive and socialist intellectuals .
Morgan , Wilson and War
The Morgan - Progressive Party ploy deliberately insured the election of Woodrow Wilson as a Democratic President .
Wilson himself , until almost the time of running for President , was for several years on the board of the Morgan - controlled Mutual Life Insurance Company .
He was also surrounded by Morgan men .
His son - in - law , William Gibbs McAdoo , who became Wilson ’s Secretary of the Treasury , was a failing businessman in New York City when he was bailed out and befriended by J.P. Morgan and his associates .
The Morgans then set McAdoo up as president of New York ’s Hudson and Manhattan Railroad until his appointment in the Wilson Administration .
McAdoo was to spend the rest of his financial and political life securely in the Morgan ambit .
The main sponsor of Wilson ’s run for the Presidency was George W. Harvey , head of Morgan - controlled Harper & Brothers publishers ; other major backers included Wall Street financier and Morgan associate Thomas Fortune Ryan , and Wilson ’s college classmate and Morgan ally , Cyrus H. McCormick , head of International Harvester .
Another close friend and leading political adviser of Wilson was New York City banker George Foster Peabody , son of the Boston Brahmin and a Morgan banker .
A particularly fascinating figure in Wilson ’s fateful foreign policy was “ Colonel ” Edward Mandell House , of the wealthy House family of Texas , which was deeply involved in landowning , trade , banking , and railroads .
House himself was head for several years of the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway , financed by the House family in collaboration with Morgan - associated Boston financial interests , particularly of the Old Colony Trust Company .
The mysterious House , though never graced with an official government post , is generally acknowledged to have been Wilson ’s all - powerful foreign policy adviser and aide for virtually his entire two terms .
By 1914 , the Morgan empire was in increasingly shaky financial shape .
The Morgans had long been committed to railroads , and after the turn of the century the highly subsidized and regulated railroads entered their permanent decline .
The Morgans had also not been active enough in the new capital market for industrial securities , which had begun in the 1890s , allowing Kuhn - Loeb to beat them in the race for industrial finance .
To make matters worse , the $ 400 million Morgan - run New Haven Railroad went bankrupt in 1914 .
At the moment of great financial danger for the Morgans , the advent of World War I came as a godsend .
Long connected to British , including Rothschild , financial interests , the Morgans leaped into the fray , quickly securing the appointment , for J.P. Morgan & Co. , of fiscal agent for the warring British and French governments , and monopoly underwriter for their war bonds in the United States .
J.P. Morgan also became the fiscal agent for the Bank of England , the powerful English central bank .
Not only that : the Morgans were heavily involved in financing American munitions and other firms exporting war material to Britain and France .
J.P. Morgan & Co. , moreover , became the central authority organizing and channeling war purchases for the two Allied nations .
The United States had been in a sharp recession during 1913 and 1914 ; unemployment was high , and many factories were operating at only 60 % of capacity .
In November 1914 , Andrew Carnegie , closely allied with the Morgans ever since his Carnegie Steel Corporation had merged into the formation of United States Steel , wrote to President Wilson lamenting business conditions but happily expecting a great change for the better from Allied purchases of U.S. exports .
Sure enough , war material exports zoomed .
Iron and steel exports quintupled from 1914 to 1917 , and the average profit rate of iron and steel firms rose from 7.4 % to 28.7 % from 1915 until 1917 .
Explosives exports to the Allies rose over ten - fold during 1915 alone .
Overall , from 1915 to 1917 , the export department of J.P. Morgan and Co. negotiated more than $ 3 billion of contracts to Britain and France .
By early 1915 , Secretary McAdoo was writing to Wilson hailing the “ great prosperity ” being brought by war exports to the Allies , and a prominent business writer wrote the following year that “ War , for Europe , is meaning devastation and death ; for America a bumper crop of new millionaires and a hectic hastening of prosperity revival . ”
Deep in Allied bonds and export of munitions , the Morgans were doing extraordinarily well ; and their great rivals , Kuhn - Loeb , being pro-German , were necessarily left out of the Allied wartime bonanza .
But there was one hitch : it became imperative that the Allies win the war .
It is not surprising , therefore , that from the beginning of the great conflict , J.P. Morgan and his associates did everything they possibly could to push the supposedly neutral United States into the war on the side of England and France .
As Morgan himself put it : “ We agreed that we should do all that was lawfully in our power to help the Allies win the war as soon as possible . ”
Accordingly , Henry P. Davison , Morgan partner , set up the Aerial Coast Patrol in 1915 , to get the public in the mood to search the skies for German planes .
Bernard M. Baruch , long - time associate of the extremely wealthy copper magnates , the Guggenheim family , financed the Businessmen ’s Training Camp , at Plattsburgh , New York , designed to push for universal military training and preparations for war .
Also participating in financing the camp were Morgan partner Willard Straight , and former Morgan partner Robert Bacon .
In addition to J.P. Morgan himself , a raft of Morgan - affiliated political leaders whooped it up for immediate entry of the U.S. into the war on the side of the Allies : including Henry Cabot Lodge , Elihu Root , and Theodore Roosevelt .
In addition , the National Security League was founded in December , 1914 , to call for American entry into the war against Germany .
The NSL issued warnings against a German invasion of the U.S. , once England was defeated , and it called all advocates of peace and non-intervention , “ pro-German , ” “ dangerous aliens , ” “ traitors , ” and “ spies . ”
The NSL also advocated universal military training , conscription , and the U.S. buildup of the largest navy in the world .
Prominent in the organization of the National Security League were Frederic R. Coudert , Wall Street attorney for the British , French , and Russian governments ; Simon and Daniel Guggenheim ; T. Coleman DuPont , of the munitions , family ; and a host of prominent Morgan - oriented financiers ; including former Morgan partner Robert Bacon ; Henry Clay Prick of Carnegie Steel ; Judge Gary of U.S. Steel ; George W. Perkins , Morgan partner , who has been termed “ the secretary of state ” for the Morgan interests ; former President Theodore Roosevelt ; and J.P. Morgan himself .
A particularly interesting founding associate of NSL was a man who has dominated American foreign policy during the 20th century : Henry L. Stimson , Secretary of War under William H. Taft and Franklin D. Roosevelt , and Secretary of State under Herbert Hoover .
Stimson , a Wall Street lawyer in the Morgan ambit , was a protégé of Morgan ’s personal attorney Elihu Root , and two of his cousins were partners in the Morgan - dominated Wall Street utility stock market and banking firm of Bonbright & Co .
While the Morgans and other financial interests were beating the drums for war , even more influential in pushing the only partially reluctant Wilson into the war were his foreign policy Svengali , Colonel House , and House ’s protégé , Walter Hines Page , who was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain .
Page ’s salary in this prestigious influential post was handsomely subsidized through Colonel House by copper magnate Cleveland H. Dodge , a prominent adviser to Wilson , who benefited greatly from munitions sales to the Allies .
Colonel House liked to pose as an abject instrument of President Wilson ’s wishes .
But before and after U.S. entry into the war , House shamelessly manipulated Wilson , in secret and traitorous collaboration with the British , to push the President first into entering the war and then into following British wishes instead of setting an independent American course .
Thus , in 1916 , House wrote to his friend Frank L. Polk , Counselor to the State Department and later counselor to J.P. Morgan , that “ the President must be guided ” not to be independent of British desires .
Advising British Prime Minister Arthur Balfour on how best to handle Wilson , House counselled Balfour to exaggerate British difficulties in order to get more American aid , and warned him never to mention a negotiated peace .
Furthermore , Balfour leaked to Colonel House the details of various secret Allied treaties that they both knew the nave Wilson would not accept , and they both agreed to keep the treaties from the President .
Similarly , soon after the U.S. entered the war , the British sent to the U.S. as personal liaison between the Prime Minister and the White House the young chief of British military intelligence , Sir William Wiseman .
House and Wiseman quickly entered a close collaboration , with House coaching the Englishman on the best way of dealing with the President , such as “ tell him only what he wants to hear , ” never argue with him , and discover and exploit his weaknesses .
In turn , Britain ’s top intelligence agent manipulated House , constantly showering him with flattery , and established a close friendship with the Colonel , getting an apartment in the same building in New York City , and travelling together abroad .
Collaborating with House in his plan to manipulate Wilson into pro-British policies was William Phillips , an Assistant Secretary of State who had married into the Astor family .
Collaborating with House in supplying Wiseman with illegal information and working with the British agent against Wilson were two important American officials .
One was Walter Lippman , a young socialist who had been named by Morgan partner Willard Straight as one of the three editors of his New Republic , a magazine which , needless to say , led ‘ the parade of progressive and socialist intellectuals in favor of entering the war on the side of the Allies .
Lippmann soon vaulted into important roles in the war effort : assistant to the Secretary of War ; then secretary of the secret group of historians called The Inquiry , established under Colonel House in late 1917 to plan the peace settlement at the end of the war .
Lippmann later left The Inquiry to go overseas for American military intelligence .
Another important collaborator with Wiseman was businessman and scholar George Louis Beer , who was in charge of African and Asian colonial matters for The Inquiry .
Wiseman secretly showed British documents on African colonies to Beer , who in turn leaked Inquiry reports to British intelligence .
The plans of Colonel House and his biased young historians of The Inquiry were put into effect at the peace settlement at Versailles .
Germany , Austria - Hungary , and Russia were cruelly dismembered , thus insuring that Germany and Russia , once recovered from the devastation of the war , would bend their energies toward getting their territories back .
In that way , conditions were virtually set for World War II .
Not only that : the Allies at Versailles took advantage of the temporary power vacuum in Eastern Europe to create new independent states that would function as client states of Britain and France , be part of the Morgan - Rothschild financial network , and help keep Germany and Russia down permanently .
It was an impossible task for these new small nations , a task made more difficult by the fact that the young historians managed to rewrite the map of Europe at Versailles to make the Poles , the Czechs , and the Serbs dominant over all the other minority nationalities forcibly incorporated into the new countries .
These subjugated peoples – the Germans , Ukrainians , Slovaks , Croats , Slovenes , etc – thus became built - in allies for the revanchist dreams of Germany and Russia .
American entry into World War I in April 1917 prevented negotiated peace between the warring powers , and drove the Allies forward into a peace of unconditional surrender and dismemberment , a peace which , as we have seen , set the stage for World War II .
American entry thus cost countless lives on both sides , chaos and disruption throughout central and eastern Europe at war ’s end , and the consequent rise of Bolshevism , fascism , and Nazism to power in Europe .
In this way , Woodrow Wilson ’s decision to enter the war may have been the single most fateful action of the 20th century , causing untold and unending misery and destruction .
But Morgan profits were expanded and assured .
The Fortuitous Fed
The massive U.S. loans to the Allies , and the subsequent American entry into the war , could not have been financed by the relatively hard - money , gold standard system that existed before 1914 .
Fortuitously , an institution was established at the end of 1913 that made the loans and war finance possible : the Federal Reserve System .
By centralizing reserves , by providing a government - privileged lender of last resort to the banks , the Fed enabled the banking system to inflate money and credit , finance loans to the Allies , and float massive deficits once the U.S. entered the war .
In addition , the seemingly odd Fed policy of creating an acceptance market out of thin air by standing ready to purchase acceptance at a subsidized rate , enabled the Fed to rediscount acceptance on munitions exports .
The Federal Reserve was the outgrowth of five years of planning , amending , and compromising among various politicians and concerned financial groups , led by the major financial interests , including the Morgans , the Rockefellers , and the Kuhn , Loebs , along with their assorted economists and technicians .
Particularly notable among the Rockefeller interests were Senator Nelson W. Aldrich ( R. - R.I. ) , father - in - law of John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , and Frank A. Vanderlip , vice president of Rockefeller ’s National City Bank of New York .
From the Kuhn , Loebs came the prominent Paul Moritz Warburg , of the German investment - banking firm of M.M. Warburg and Company .
Warburg emigrated to the United States in 1902 to become a senior partner at Kuhn , Loeb & Co. , after which he spent most of his time agitating for a central bank in the United States .
Also igniting the drive for a Federal Reserve System was Jacob H. Schiff , powerful head of Kuhn , Loeb to whom Warburg was related by marriage .
Seconding and sponsoring Warburg in academia was the prominent Columbia University economist Edwin R.A. Seligman , of the investment - banking family of J. & W. Seligman and Company ; Seligman was the brother of Warburg ’s brother - in - law .
The Morgans were prominently represented in the planning and agitation for a Central Bank by Henry P. Davison , Morgan partner ; Charles D. Norton , president of Morgan ’s First National Bank of New York ; A. Barton Hepburn , head of Morgan ’s Chase National Bank ; and Victor Morawetz , attorney and banker in the Morgan ranks and chairman of the executive committee of the Morgan - controlled Atchison , Topeka , and Santa Fe Railroad .
While the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in late 1913 was the result of a coalition of Morgan , Rockefeller , and Kuhn , Loeb interests , there is no question which financial group controlled the personnel and the policies of the Fed once it was established .
( While influential in framing policies of the Fed , Federal Reserve Board member Warburg was disqualified from leadership because of his pro-German views . )
The first Federal Reserve Board , appointed by President Wilson in 1914 , included Warburg ; one Rockefeller man , Frederic A. Delano , uncle of Franklin D. Roosevelt , and president of the Rockefeller - controlled Wabash Railway ; and an Alabama banker , who had both Morgan and Rockefeller connections .
Overshadowing these three were three definite Morgan men , and a university economist , Professor Adolph C. Miller of Berkeley , whose wife ’s family had Morgan connections .
The three definite Morgan men were Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo ; Comptroller of the Currency John Skelton Williams , a Virginia banker and long - time McAdoo aide on Morgan railroads ; and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Charles S. Hamlin , a Boston attorney who had married into a wealthy Albany family long connected with the Morgan - dominated New York Central Railroad .
But more important than the composition of the Federal Reserve Board was the man who became the first Governor of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and who single - handedly dominated Fed policy from its inception until his death in 1928 .
This man was Benjamin Strong , who had spent virtually his entire business and personal life in the circle of top associates of J.P. Morgan .
A secretary of several trust companies ( banks doing trust business ) in New York City , Strong became neighbor and close friend of three top Morgan partners , Henry P. Davison , Dwight Morrow , and Thomas W. Lamont .
Davison , in particular , became his mentor , and brought him into Morgan ’s Bankers Trust company , where he soon succeeded Lamont as vice - president , and then finally became president .
When Strong was offered the post of Governor of the New York Fed , it was Davison who persuaded him to take the job .
Strong was an enthusiast for American entry into the war , and it was his mentor Davison who had engineered the coup of getting Morgan named as sole underwriter and purchasing agent for Britain and France .
Strong worked quickly to formalize collaboration with the Bank of England , collaboration which would continue in force throughout the 1920s .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York became foreign agent for the Bank of England , and vice versa .
The main collaboration throughout the 1920s , much of it kept secret from the Federal Reserve Board in Washington , was between Strong and the man who soon became Governor of the Bank of England , Montagu Collet Norman .
Norman and Strong were not only fast friends , but had important investment - banking ties , Norman ’s uncle having been a partner of the great English banking firm of Baring Brothers , and his grandfather a partner in the international banking house of Brown Shipley & Co. , the London branch of the Wall Street banking firm of Brown Brothers .
Before coming to the Bank of England , Norman himself had worked at the Wall Street office of Brown Brothers , and then returned to London to become a partner of Brown Shipley .
The major fruit of the Norman - Strong collaboration was Strong ’s being pressured to inflate money and credit in the U.S. throughout the 1920s , in order to keep England from losing gold to the U.S. from its inflationary policies .
Britain ’s predicament came from its insistence on going back to the gold standard after the war at the highly overvalued pre-war par for the pound , and then insisting on inflating rather than deflating to make its exports competitively priced in the world market .
Hence , Britain needed to induce other countries , particularly the U.S. , to inflate along with it .
The Strong - Norman - Morgan connection did the job , setting the stage for the great financial collapse of 1929 – 1931 .
As World War I drew to a close , influential Britons and Americans decided that intimate post - war collaboration between the two countries required more than just close cooperation between the central banks .
Also needed were permanent organizations to promote joint Anglo - American policies to dominate the postwar world .
The Round Table
In England , Cecil Rhodes had launched a secret society in 1891 with the aim of maintaining and expanding the British Empire to re-incorporate the United States .
After the turn of the 20th century , the direction , organization , and expansion of the society fell to Rhodes ’s friend and executor , Alfred Lord Milner .
The Milner Group dominated domestic planning in Britain during World War I , and particularly the planning for post - war foreign and colonial policy .
The Milner Group staffed the British delegation of experts to Versailles .
To promote the intellectual agitation for such a policy , the Milners had also set up the Round Table Groups in England and abroad in 1910 .
The first American to be asked to join the Round Table was George Louis Beer , who came to its attention when his books attacked the American Revolution and praised the British Empire of the 18th century .
Such loyalty could not go unrewarded , and so Beer became a member of the Group about 1912 and became the American correspondent of Round Table magazine .
We have seen Beer ’s pro-British role as colonial expert for The Inquiry .
He was also the chief U.S. expert on colonial affairs at Versailles , and afterward the Milner Group made Beer head of the Mandate Department of the League of Nations .
During the war , Beer , Anglophile Yale historian George Burton Adams , and powerful Columbia University historian James T. Shotwell , an important leader of The Inquiry and head of the National Board for Historical Services , which emitted deceptive propaganda for the war effort , formed a secret society to promote Anglo - American collaboration .
Finally , led by Beer for the United States and the head of the Round Table group in England , Lionel Curtis , the British and U.S. historical staffs at Versailles took the occasion to found a permanent organization to agitate for an informally , if not formally , reconstituted Anglo - American Empire .
The new group , the Institute of International Affairs , was formed at a meeting at the Majestic Hotel in Paris on May 3O , 1919 .
A six - man organizing committee was formed , three Milnerites from Britain , and three Americans : Shotwell ; Harvard historian Archibald C. Coolidge , head of the Eastern European desk of the Inquiry , and member of the Morgan - oriented Boston financial family ; and James Brown Scott , Morgan lawyer who was to write a biography of Robert Bacon .
The British branch , the Royal Institute of International Affairs , set up a committee to supervise writing a multi-volume history of the Versailles Peace Conference ; the committee was financed by a gift from Thomas W. Lamont , Morgan partner .
The CFR
The American branch of the new group took a while to get going .
Finally , the still inactive American Institute of International Affairs merged with a defunct outfit , begun in 1918 , of New York businessmen concerned with the postwar world , and organized as a dinner club to listen to foreign visitors .
This organization , the Council on Foreign Relations , had as its honorary chairman Morgan lawyer Elihu Root , while Alexander Hemphill , chairman of Morgan ’s Guaranty Trust Company , was chairman of its finance committee .
In August 1921 , the two organizations merged into the new Council on Foreign Relations , Inc. , a high - powered organization embracing bankers , lawyers , and intellectuals .
While varied financial interests were represented in the new organization , the CFR was Morgan - dominated , from top to bottom .
Honorary president was Elihu Root .
President was John W. Davis , Wilson ’s Solicitor - General , and now chief counsel for J.P. Morgan & Co. Davis was to become Democratic Presidential candidate in 1924 .
Secretary - Treasurer of the new CFR was Harvard economic historian Edwin F. Gay , director of planning and statistics for the Shipping Board during the war , and now editor of the New York Evening Post , owned by his mentor , Morgan partner , Thomas W. Lamont .
It was Gay who had the idea of founding Foreign Affairs , the CFR ’s quarterly journal , and who suggested both his Harvard colleague Archibald Coolidge as the first editor , and the New York Post reporter Hamilton Fish Armstrong as assistant editor and executive director of the CFR .
Other prominent officials in the new CFR were : Frank L. Polk , former Under - Secretary of State and now lawyer for J.P. Morgan & Co ; Paul M. Warburg of Kuhn , Loeb ; Otto H. Kahn of Kuhn , Loeb ; former Under - Secretary of State under Wilson , Norman H. Davis , a banking associate of the Morgans ; and as vice - president , Paul D. Cravath , senior partner of the Rockefeller - oriented Wall Street law firm of Cravath , Swaine , and Moore .
After World War II , the Council on Foreign Relations became dominated by the Rockefeller rather than by the Morgan interests , a shift of power reflecting a general alteration in financial power in the world at large .
After World War II , the rise of oil to prominence brought the Morgans and Rockefellers – once intense rivals – into an Eastern Establishment of which the Rockefellers were the senior , and the Morgans the junior , partners .
Rockefeller , Morgan , and War
During the 1930s , the Rockefellers pushed hard for war against Japan , which they saw as competing with them vigorously for oil and rubber resources in Southeast Asia and as endangering the Rockefellers ’ cherished dreams of a mass “ China market ” for petroleum products .
On the other hand , the Rockefellers took a non-interventionist position in Europe , where they had close financial ties with German firms such as I.G. Farben and Co. , and very few close relations with Britain and France .
The Morgans , in contrast , as usual deeply committed to their financial ties with Britain and France , once again plumped early for war with Germany , while their interest in the Far East had become minimal .
Indeed , U.S. Ambassador to Japan , Joseph C. Grew , former Morgan partner , was one of the few officials in the Roosevelt Administration genuinely interested in peace with Japan .
World War II might therefore be considered , from one point of view , as a coalition war : the Morgans got their war in Europe , the Rockefellers theirs in Asia .
Such disgruntled Morgan men as Lewis W. Douglas and Dean G. Acheson ( a protégé of Henry Stimson ) , who had left the early Roosevelt Administration in disgust at its soft money policies and economic nationalism , came happily roaring back into government service with the advent of World War II .
Nelson A. Rockefeller , for his part , became head of Latin American activities during World War II , and thereby acquired his taste for government service .
After World War II , the united Rockefeller - MorganKuhn , Loeb Eastern Establishment was not allowed to enjoy its financial and political supremacy unchallenged for long .
“ Cowboy ” Sun Belt firms , maverick oil men and construction men from Texas , Florida , and southern California , began to challenge the Eastern Establishment “ Yankees ” for political power .
While both groups favor the Cold War , the Cowboys are more nationalistic , more hawkish , and less inclined to worry about what our European allies are thinking .
They are also much less inclined to bail out the now Rockefeller - controlled Chase Manhattan Bank and other Wall Street banks that loaned recklessly to Third World and Communist countries and expect the U.S. taxpayer – through outright taxes or the printing of U.S. dollars – to pick up the tab .
It should be clear that the name of the political party in power is far less important than the particular regime ’s financial and banking connections .
The foreign policy power for so long of Nelson Rockefeller ’s personal foreign affairs adviser , Henry A. Kissinger , a discovery of the extraordinarily powerful Rockefeller –Chase Manhattan Bank elder statesman John J. McCloy , is testimony to the importance of financial power .
As is the successful lobbying by Kissinger and Chase Manhattan ’s head , David Rockefeller , to induce Jimmy Carter to allow the ailing Shah of Iran into the U.S. – thus precipitating the humiliating hostage crisis .
Despite differences in nuance , it is clear that Ronald Reagan ’s originally proclaimed challenge to Rockefeller - Morgan power in the Council of Foreign Relations and to the Rockefeller - created Trilateral Commission has fizzled , and that the “ permanent government ” continues to rule regardless of the party nominally in power .
As a result , the much - heralded “ bipartisan foreign policy ” consensus imposed by the Establishment since World War II seems to remain safely in place .
David Rockefeller , chairman of the board of his family ’s Chase Manhattan Bank from 1970 until recently , established the Trilateral Commission in 1973 with the financial backing of the CFR and the Rockefeller Foundation .
Joseph Kraft , syndicated Washington columnist who himself has the distinction of being both a CFR member and a Trilateralist , has accurately described the CFR as a “ school for statesmen , ” which “ comes close to being an organ of what C. Wright Mills has called the Power Elite – a group of men , similar in interest and outlook , shaping events from invulnerable positions behind the scenes . ”
The idea of the Trilateral Commission was to internationalize policy formation , the commission consisting of a small group of multinational corporate leaders , politicians , and foreign policy experts from the U.S. , Western Europe , and Japan , who meet to coordinate economic and foreign policy among their respective nations .
Perhaps the most powerful single figure in foreign policy since World War II , a beloved adviser to all Presidents , is the octogenarian John J. McCloy .
During World War II , McCloy virtually ran the War Department as Assistant to aging Secretary Stimson ; it was McCloy who presided over the decision to round up all Japanese - Americans and place them in concentration camps in World War II , and he is virtually the only American left who still justifies that action .
Before and during the war , McCloy , a disciple of Morgan lawyer Stimson , moved in the Morgan orbit ; his brother - in - law , John S. Zinsser , was on the board of directors of J.P. Morgan & Co. during the 1940s .
But , reflecting the postwar power shift from Morgan to Rockefeller , McCloy moved quickly into the Rockefeller ambit .
He became a partner of the Wall Street corporate law firm of Milbank , Tweed , Hope , Hadley & McCloy , which had long served the Rockefeller family and the Chase Bank as legal counsel .
From there he moved to become Chairman of the Board of the Chase Manhattan Bank , a director of the Rockefeller Foundation , and of Rockefeller Center , Inc. , and finally , from 1953 until 1970 , chairman of the board of the Council on Foreign Relations .
During the Truman Administration , McCloy served as President of the World Bank and then U.S. High Commissioner for Germany .
He was also a special adviser to President John F. Kennedy on Disarmament , and chairman of Kennedy ’s Coordinating Committee on the Cuban Crisis .
It was McCloy who “ discovered ” Professor Henry A. Kissinger for the Rockefeller forces .
It is no wonder that John K. Galbraith and Richard Rovere have dubbed McCloy “ Mr. Establishment . ”
A glance at foreign policy leaders since World War II will reveal the domination of the banker elite .
Truman ’s first Secretary of Defense was James V. Forrestal , former president of the investment - banking firm of Dillon , Read & Co. , closely allied to the Rockefeller financial group .
Forrestal had also been a board member of the Chase Securities Corporation , an affiliate of the Chase National Bank .
Another Truman Defense Secretary was Robert A. Lovett , a partner of the powerful New York investment - banking house of Brown Brothers Harriman .
At the same time that he was Secretary of Defense , Lovett continued to be a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation .
Secretary of the Air Force Thomas K. Finletter was a top Wall Street corporate lawyer and member of the board of the CFR while serving in the cabinet .
Ambassador to Soviet Russia , Ambassador to Great Britain , and Secretary of Commerce in the Truman Administration was the powerful multi-millionaire W. Averell Harriman , an often underrated but dominant force within the Democratic Party since the days of FDR .
Harriman was a partner of Brown Brothers Harriman .
Also Ambassador to Great Britain under Truman was Lewis W. Douglas , brother - in - law of John J. McCloy , a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation , and a board member of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Following Douglas as Ambassador to the Court of St. James was Walter S. Gifford , chairman of the board of AT&T , and member of the board of trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation for almost two decades .
Ambassador to NATO under Truman was William H. Draper , Jr. , vice - president of Dillon , Read &Co .
Also influential in helping the Truman Administration organize the Cold War was director of the policy planning staff of the State Department , Paul H. Nitze .
Nitze , whose wife was a member of the Pratt family , associated with the Rockefeller family since the origins of Standard Oil , had been vice - president of Dillon , Read & Co .
When Truman entered the Korean War , he created an Office of Defense Mobilization to run the domestic economy during the war .
The first director was Charles E. ( “ Electric Charlie ” ) Wilson , president of the Morgan - controlled General Electric Company , who also served as board member of the Morgans ’ Guaranty Trust Company .
His two most influential assistants were Sidney J. Weinberg , ubiquitous senior partner in the Wall Street investment - banking firm of Goldman Sachs & Co. , and former General Lucius D. Clay , chairman of the board of Continental Can Co. , and a director of the Lehman Corporation .
Succeeding McCloy as President of the World Bank , and continuing in that post throughout the two terms of Dwight Eisenhower , was Eugene Black .
Black had served for fourteen years as vice - president of the Chase National Bank , and was persuaded to take the World Bank post by the bank ’s chairman of the board , Winthrop W. Aldrich , brother - in - law of John D. Rockefeller , Jr .
The Eisenhower Administration proved to be a field day for the Rockefeller interests .
While president of Columbia University , Eisenhower was invited to high - level dinners where he met and was groomed for President by top leaders from the Rockefeller and Morgan ambits , including the chairman of the board of Rockefeller ’s Standard Oil of New Jersey , the presidents of six other big oil companies , including Standard of California and Socony - Vacuum , and the executive vice - president of J.P. Morgan & Co .
One dinner was hosted by Clarence Dillon , the multi-millionaire retired founder of Dillon , Read & Co. , where the guests included Russell B. Leffingwell , chairman of the board of both J.P. Morgan & Co. and the CFR ( before McCloy ) ; John M. Schiff , a senior partner of the investment - banking house of Kuhn , Loeb & Co. ; the financier Jeremiah Milbank , a director of the Chase Manhattan Bank ; and John D. Rockefeller , Jr .
Even earlier , during 1949 , Eisenhower had been introduced through a special study group to key figures in the CFR .
The study group devised a plan to create a new organization called the American Assembly – in essence an expanded CFR study group – whose main function was reputedly to build up Eisenhower ’s prospects for the Presidency .
A leader of the “ Citizens for Eisenhower ” committee , who later became Ike ’s Ambassador to Great Britain , was the multi-millionaire John Hay Whitney , scion of several wealthy families , whose granduncle , Oliver H. Payne , had been one of the associates of John D. Rockefeller , Sr. in founding the Standard Oil Company .
Whitney was head of his own investment concern , J.H. Whitney & Co. , and later became publisher of the New York Herald Tribune .
Running foreign policy during the Eisenhower Administration was the Dulles family , led by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , who had also concluded the U.S. peace treaty with Japan under Harry Truman .
Dulles had for three decades been a senior partner of the top Wall Street corporate law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell , whose most important client was Rockefeller ’s Standard Oil Company of New Jersey .
Dulles had been for fifteen years a member of the board of the Rockefeller Foundation , and before assuming the post of Secretary of State was chairman of the board of that institution .
Most important is the little - known fact that Dulles ’s wife was Janet Pomeroy Avery , a first cousin of John D. Rockefeller , Jr .
Heading the super - secret Central Intelligence Agency during the Eisenhower years was Dulles ’s brother , Allen Welsh Dulles , also a partner in Sullivan & Cromwell .
Allen Dulles had long been a trustee of the CFR and had served as its president from 1947 to 1951 .
Their sister , Eleanor Lansing Dulles , was head of the Berlin desk of the State Department during that decade .
Under -Secretary of State , and the man who succeeded John Foster Dulles in the spring 1959 , was former Massachusetts Governor Christian A. Herter .
Herter ’s wife , like Nitze ’s , was a member of the Pratt family .
Indeed , his wife ’s uncle , Herbert L. Pratt , had been for many years president or chairman of the board of Standard Oil Company of New York .
One of Mrs. Herter ’s cousins , Richardson Pratt , had served as assistant treasurer of Standard Oil of New Jersey up to 1945 .
Furthermore , one of Herter ’s own uncles , a physician , had been for many years treasurer of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research .
Herter was succeeded as Under - Secretary of State by Eisenhower ’s Ambassador to France , C. Douglas Dillon , son of Clarence , and himself Chairman of the Board of Dillon , Read & Co. Dillon was soon to become a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation .
Perhaps to provide some balance for his banker - business coalition , Eisenhower appointed as Secretary of Defense three men in the Morgan rather than the Rockefeller ambit .
Charles B. ( “ Engine Charlie ” ) Wilson was president of General Motors , member of the board of J.P. Morgan & Co. Wilson ’s successor , Neil H. McElroy , was president of Proctor & Gamble Co . His board chairman , R.R. Deupree , was also a director of J.P. Morgan & Co .
The third Secretary of Defense , who had been Under - Secretary and Secretary of the Navy under Eisenhower , was Thomas S. Gates , Jr. , who had been a partner of the Morgan - connected Philadelphia investment - banking firm of Drexel & Co .
When Gates stepped down as Defense Secretary , he became president of the newly formed flagship commercial bank for the Morgan interests , the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co .
Serving as Secretary of the Navy and then Deputy Secretary of Defense ( and later Secretary of the Treasury ) under Eisenhower was Texas businessman Robert B. Anderson .
After leaving the Defense Department , Anderson became a board member of the Rockefeller - controlled American Overseas Investing Co. , and , before becoming Secretary of the Treasury , he borrowed $ 84,000 from Nelson A. Rockefeller to buy stock in Nelson ’s International Basic Economy Corporation .
Head of the important Atomic Energy Commission during the Eisenhower years was Lewis L. Strauss .
For two decades , Strauss had been a partner in the investment - banking firm of Kuhn , Loeb & Co .
In 1950 , Strauss had become financial adviser to the Rockefeller family , soon also becoming a board member of Rockefeller Center , Inc .
A powerful force in deciding foreign policy was the National Security Council , which included on it the Duller brothers , Strauss , and Wilson .
Particularly important is the post of national security adviser to the President .
Eisenhower ’s first national security adviser was Robert Cutler , president of the Old Colony Trust Co. , the largest trust operation outside New York City .
The Old Colony was a trust affiliate of the First National Bank of Boston .
After two years in the top national security post , Cutler returned to Boston to become chairman of the board of Old Colony Trust , returning after a while to the national security slot for two more years .
In between , Eisenhower had two successive national security advisers .
The first was Dillon Anderson , a Houston corporate attorney , who did work for several oil companies .
Particularly significant was Anderson ’s position as chairman of the board of a small but fascinating Connecticut firm called Electro - Mechanical Research , Inc. Electro - Mechanical was closely associated with certain Rockefeller financiers ; thus , one of its directors was Godfrey Rockefeller , a limited partner in the investment - banking firm of Clark , Dodge & Co .
After more than a year , Anderson resigned from his national security post and was replaced by William H. Jackson , a partner of the investment firm of J. H. Whitney & Co. Before assuming his powerful position , Dillon Anderson had been one of several men serving as special hush - hush consultants to the National Security Council .
Another special adviser was Eugene Holman , president of Rockefeller ’s Standard Oil Company of New Jersey .
We may mention two important foreign policy actions of the Eisenhower Administration which seem to reflect the striking influence of personnel directly tied to bankers and financial interests .
In 1951 , the regime of Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran decided to nationalize the British - owned oil holdings of the Anglo - Iranian Oil company .
It took no time for the newly established Eisenhower Administration to intervene heavily in this situation .
CIA director and former Standard Oil lawyer Allen W. Dulles flew to Switzerland to organize the covert overthrow of the Mossadegh regime , the throwing of Mossadegh into prison , and the restoration of the Shah to the throne of Iran .
After lengthy behind - the - scenes negotiations , the oil industry was put back into action as purchasers and refiners of Iranian oil .
But this time the picture was significantly different .
Instead of the British getting all of the oil pie , their share was reduced to 40 percent of the new oil consortium , with five top U.S. oil companies ( Standard Oil of New Jersey , Socony - Vacuum – formerly Standard Oil of N.Y. and now Mobil – Standard Oil of California , Gulf , and Texaco ) getting another 40 percent .
It was later disclosed that Secretary of State Dulles placed a sharp upper limit on any participation in the consortium by smaller independent oil companies in the United States .
In addition to the rewards to the Rockefeller interests , the CIA ’s man -on - the - spot directing the operation , Kermit Roosevelt , received his due by quickly becoming a vice - president of Mellon ’s Gulf Oil Corp .
The Guatemalan Coup
Fresh from its CIA triumph in Iran , the Eisenhower Administration next turned its attention to Guatemala , where the left - liberal regime of Jacob Arbenz Guzman had nationalized 234,000 acres of uncultivated land owned by the nation ’s largest landholder , the American - owned United Fruit Company , which imported about 60 percent of all bananas coming into the United States .
Arbenz also announced his intention of seizing another 173,000 acres of idle United Fruit land along the Caribbean coast .
In late 1953 , Eisenhower gave the CIA the assignment of organizing a counter - revolution in Guatemala .
With the actual operation directed by former Wall Street corporate lawyer Frank Wisner of the CIA , the agency launched a successful invasion of Guatemala , led by exiled Army Colonel Castilo Armas , which soon overthrew the Arbenz regime and replaced it with a military junta .
The Arbenz land program was abolished , and most of its expropriated property was returned to the United Fruit Company .
Allen W. Dulles had financial connections with United Fruit and with various sugar companies which had also suffered land expropriation from the Arbenz regime .
For several years , while a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell , he had been a board member of the Rockefeller - controlled J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation .
Members of the board of Schroder during 1953 included Delano Andrews , Sullivan & Cromwell partner who had taken Dulles ’s seat on the board ; George A. Braga , president of the Manati Sugar Company ; Charles W. Gibson , vice - president of the Rockefeller - affiliated Air Reduction Company ; and Avery Rockefeller , president of the closely linked banking house of Schroder , Rockefeller , & Co. Members of the board of Manati Sugar , in the meanwhile , included Alfred Jaretski , Jr. , another Sullivan & Cromwell partner ; Gerald F. Beal , president of J. Henry Schroder and chairman of the board of the International Railways of Central America ; and Henry E. Worcester , a recently retired of executive of United Fruit .
United Fruit , furthermore , was a controlling shareholder in International Railways , while , as in the case of Beal , the board chairmanship of the railway had long been held by a high official of Schroder .
The close ties between United Fruit , Schroder , and International Railways may also be seen by the fact that , in 1959 , the board chairman of the railway became James McGovern , general counsel for United Fruit .
International Railway , in fact , carried most of United Fruit ’s produce from the interior to the port in Guatemala .
In addition , Dulles ’s close associate and fellow trustee of the Council of Foreign Relations in this period , and former treasurer of the CFR , was Whitney H. Shepardson , formerly vice - president of International Railways .
Not only that : Robert Cutler , national security adviser to the President at the time of the coup against Arbenz , had himself very close ties to United Fruit .
Cutler ’s boss at Old Colony Trust , chairman of the board T. Jefferson Coolidge , was also , and more importantly , board chairman at United Fruit .
Indeed , many members of the board of United Fruit , a Boston - based company , were also on the board of Old Colony or its mother company , the First National Bank of Boston .
Furthermore , during the period of planning the Guatemalan coup , and up till a few months before its success in 1954 , the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter - American Affairs was John Moors Cabot , a well - known anti-Arbenz hawk .
Cabot ’s brother Thomas D. , was an executive of United Fruit and a member of the board of the First National Bank of Boston .
The Council on Foreign Relations played an important role in the Guatemalan invasion .
It began in the fall of 1952 , when Spruille Braden , a former Assistant Secretary of State for Inter - American Affairs and then consultant for United Fruit , led a CFR study group on Political Unrest in Latin America .
Discussion leader at the first meeting of the CFR - Braden group was John McClintock , an executive of United Fruit .
Former leading New Dealer and Assistant Secretary of State Adolf A. Berle , Jr. , a participant in the study group , recorded in his diary that the U.S. should welcome an overthrow of the Arbenz government , and noted that , “ I am arranging to see Nelson Rockefeller ( himself Assistant Secretary of State for Inter - American Affairs during World War II ) who knows the situation and can work a little with General Eisenhower . ”
In the actual Guatemalan operation , President Eisenhower himself was a CFR member , as were Allen Dulles , John M. Cabot and Frank Wisner , the man in charge of the coup and the CIA ’s deputy director for plans .
Of the twelve people in the U.S. government identified as being involved at the top level in the Guatemalan affair , eight were CFR members or would be within a few years .
These included , in addition to the above , Henry F. Holland , who succeeded Cabot in the assistant secretary of state slot in 1954 ; Under - Secretary of State Walter Bedell Smith , a former director of the CIA ; and Ambassador to the UN Henry Cabot Lodge .
Paving the way for the coup was a public report , issued in December 1953 by the Committee on International Policy of the National Planning Association on the Guatemalan situation .
Head of the Committee was Frank Altschul , secretary and vice - president of the CFR and a partner of the international banking house of Lazard Freres , as well as a director of the Chase National Bank and president of the General American Investor Corp. , a firm largely controlled by Lehman Brothers .
The Altschul report , signed by twenty - two committee members of whom fifteen were CFR members , warned that “ Communist infiltration in Guatemala ” was a threat to the security of the Western Hemisphere and hinted that drastic action would probably be necessary to deal with this menace .
Of those involved in the drastic action , Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , while at Sullivan & Cromwell , had once represented United Fruit in negotiating a contract with Guatemala .
Under - Secretary of State Walter Bedell Smith , after leaving the government , became director of United Fruit , as did Robert D. Hill , who participated in the Guatemala operation as Ambassador to Costa Rica .
Furthermore , future president of Guatemala , Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes , noted that his own cooperation in the coup against Arbenz was obtained by Walter Turnbull , a former executive at United Fruit , who came to him along with two CIA agents .
JFK and the Establishment
When John F. Kennedy assumed the office of President , the first person he turned to for foreign policy advice was Robert A. Lovett , partner of Brown Brothers , Harriman , even though Lovett had backed Richard Nixon .
Kennedy asked Lovett to take his pick of any of three top jobs in the Cabinet – State , Defense , and Treasury – but the ill and aging Lovett demurred .
It was at Lovett ’s urging , however , that Kennedy chose as Secretary of State Dean Rusk , president of the Rockefeller Foundation , a post he had acquired because of the strong backing of John Foster Dulles .
Under - Secretary of State was Chester Bowles , a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation ; Bowles was soon replaced by corporate lawyer George Bail , who was later to become a senior managing partner at Lehman Brothers .
For Secretary of Defense Kennedy chose Robert S. McNamara , President of Ford Motor Company .
One influential force in the McNamara appointment was the backing of Sidney J. Weinberg , partner of the investment - banking firm of Goldman , Sachs , & Co. , and powerful fund - raiser for the Democratic Party .
Weinberg was a member of the board of Ford Motor Company .
Perhaps even more important was the intimate Ford connection with the investment - banking house of Lehman Brothers , which had long carried great weight in the party ; at that time , five high - ranking Ford executives sat on the board of the One William Street Fund , a mutual fund recently established by Lehman Brothers .
Secretary of the Air Force was Eugene Zuckert , chairman of the board of the small Pittsburgh firm , the Nuclear Science and Engineering Corp. , controlled by the powerful Lehman Brothers .
Before going to this firm , Zuckert had been a member of the Atomic Energy Commission ; former ABC Commissioner Gordon Dean , who had preceded Zuckert as chairman of the board of Nuclear Science and Engineering , was also a partner of Lehman Brothers .
General counsel of the Defense Department , and soon to become Secretary of the Army , was Wall Street corporate lawyer Cyrus Vance , later to become Secretary of State under Carter .
Vance ’s law firm – Simpson , Thacher & Bartlett – represented Lehman Brothers and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Moreover , Vance had married into New York ’s wealthy W & J Sloane family ; his father - in - law , John Sloane , had served as a director of the United States Trust Co .
Secretary of the Treasury in the Kennedy Cabinet was C. Douglas Dillon , of Dillon , Read and the Rockefeller Foundation .
Dillon saw no problem in serving for eight years as Ambassador to France and as a State Department official during the Eisenhower Era , and then segueing to the Democratic Kennedy Cabinet .
Like Lovett , he too was chosen even though he had been a big contributor to the Nixon effort of 1960 .
In the powerful post of National Security Adviser , Kennedy selected Harvard Dean McGeorge Bundy , who had been part of a high - powered foreign policy team advising Thomas B. Dewey in the 1948 campaign , a virtually all - Rockefeller dominated team headed by John Foster Dulles and including Dulles ’s brother Allen , C. Douglas Dillon , and Christian Herter .
After that , Bundy worked for the Council on Foreign Relations .
Bundy had been born into the wealthy Boston Brahmin Lowell family , his mother having been a Lowell .
His father Harvey H. Bundy , was a partner in Boston ’s top law firm of Choate , Hall & Stewart , a high official of the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council , and a director of the Merchants National Bank of Boston .
McGeorge ’s brother , William , a high CIA official , was married to the daughter of former Secretary of State Dean Acheson , and his sister Katherine married into the socially prominent Auchinchloss family , the family of Jacqueline Kennedy .
The strong Rockefeller influence on Kennedy foreign policy is best seen in the fact that the new President continued Allen W. Dulles as head of the CIA .
It was at the urging of Dulles that Kennedy decided to go ahead with the CIA ’s previously planned and disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba .
Fidel Castro ’s regime had recently nationalized a large number of American - owned sugar companies in Cuba .
It might be noted that Dulles ’s old law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell served as general counsel for two of these large sugar companies , the Francisco Sugar Co. and the Manati Sugar Co. , and that one of the board members of these firms was Gerald F. Beal , president of the Rockefeller - oriented J. Henry Schroder Bank , of which Dulles had once been a director .
Not only that .
John L. Loeb of the Loeb , Rhoades investment bank , whose wife was a member of the Lehman banking family , owned a large block of stock in the nationalized Compania Azucarera Atlantica del Golfo , a big sugar plantation in Cuba , while one of the directors of the latter company was Harold F. Linder , vice - chairman of the General American Investors Company , dominated by Lehman Brothers and Lazard Freres investment bankers .
Linder was appointed head of the Export - Import Bank by President Kennedy .
After the Bay of Pigs fiasco , Dulles was replaced as head of the CIA by West Coast industrialist John A. McCone , who also had the capacity to serve the administrations of either party with equal ease .
Under - Secretary of the Air Force under Truman and head of the Atomic Energy Commission under Eisenhower , McCone was president of the Bechtel - McCone Corporation , and represents the first major incursion of the international Bechtel construction interests into American politics .
McCone was also a board member of the California Bank of Los Angeles , and of the Rockefeller - dominated Standard Oil Company of California .
The CIA was also heavily involved about this time in the short - lived Katanga secession movement in the old Belgian Congo .
One of the largest of the American companies in Katanga , and a major backer of the secession movement , was the Anglo - American Corporation of South Africa , one of whose partners was mining magnate Charles W. Engelhard .
Engelhard ’s investment banker was Dillon , Read , the family firm of Kennedy ’s Secretary of the Treasury , C. Douglas Dillon .
We have seen that Mr. Establishment , the Rockefeller - oriented John J. McCloy , served as Kennedy ’s special adviser on disarmament .
When the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was created in the fall of 1961 , its first head was William C. Foster , former Under - Secretary of State and Defense under Truman .
In between , Foster had served as a high official of the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corp. , and then board chairman of the Rockefeller - dominated United Nuclear Corp .
Foster was also a director of the CFR .
Kennedy continued Rockefeller ’s Eugene Black as head of the powerful World Bank .
When Black reached retirement age in 1962 , he was replaced by George D. Woods , chairman of the board of the prominent investment bank , First Boston Corporation .
Woods had many connections with the Rockefeller interests , including being a director of the Chase International Investment Corp. , of the Rockefeller Foundation , and of other Rockefeller - dominated concerns .
Two important foreign policy actions of the Kennedy Administration were the Cuban Missile Crisis and the escalation of the war in Vietnam .
Kennedy was advised during the Cuban missile crisis by an ad hoc group called the Ex Comm , which included , along with his official major foreign policy advisers , Robert A. Lovett and John J. McCloy .
In the Vietnam War , Kennedy brought in as Ambassador to South Vietnam the Boston Brahmin and Morgan - oriented Henry Cabot Lodge , who had been Eisenhower ’s Ambassador to the United Nations and who had run for Vice - President on the Nixon ticket in 1960 .
Virtually the last foreign policy act of John F. Kennedy was to give the green light to Lodge and the CIA to oust , and murder , South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem .
LBJ and the Power Elite
Lyndon Johnson ’s foreign policy was dominated by his escalation of the Vietnam conflict into a full - scale ( if undeclared ) war , and of the increasing splits over the war among the financial power elite .
Johnson retained the hawkish Rusk , McNamara , McCone , and Lodge in their posts .
As newly minted Vietnam doves were ousted from foreign policy positions , they were replaced by hawks .
Thus , William Bundy became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs , at the same time becoming a director of the CFR .
On the other hand , the increasingly critical W. Averell Harriman was ousted from his post of Under - Secretary of State .
Cyrus Vance continued as Johnson ’s Secretary of the Army ; when he rose to Deputy Secretary of Defense , he was replaced by Vance ’s old friend and roommate at Yale , Stanley R. Resor .
Resor was a partner in the major Wall Street law firm of Debevoise , Plimpton , Lyons , & Gates , and was the brother - in - law of economist and banker Gabriel Hauge , president of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust , and treasurer of the CFR .
Resor had married into the Pillsbury flour family of Minneapolis , which had long been connected with the holding company , the Northwest BanCorporation .
After Vance retired as Deputy Secretary of Defense to return to law practice , he was replaced by Johnson ’s hard - line Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze , former partner of Dillon , Read , whose wife was a member of the Rockefeller - connected Pratt family .
One important meeting at which it was decided to escalate the Vietnam War was held in July 1965 .
The meeting consisted of Johnson , his designated foreign policy and military officials , and three key unofficial advisers : Clark M. Clifford , the chairman of the President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , and an attorney for the duPonts and the Morgan - dominated General Electric Co. ; Arthur H. Dean , a partner in Rockefeller - oriented Sullivan & Cromwell and a director of the CFR ; and the ubiquitous John J. McCloy .
Shortly after the meeting , a distinguished national committee of power elite figures was formed to back President Johnson ’s aggressive policies in Vietnam .
Chairman of the committee was Arthur H. Dean ; other members were Dean Acheson ; Eugene Black , who , after retiring as head of the World Bank , returned to be a director of Chase Manhattan ; Gabriel Hauge of Manufacturers ’
Trust and the CFR ; David Rockefeller , president of the Chase Manhattan Bank and a vice - president of the CFR ; and two board members of AT&T , William B. Murphy and James R. Killian , Jr. Indeed , of the 46 members of this pro-Vietnam War committee , 19 were prominent businessmen , bankers or corporate lawyers .
Later , when Johnson needed to raise taxes to supply more funds for the war effort , he selected thirteen businessmen to head the lobbying effort .
A fascinating aspect of the Johnson Administration was the heavy influence of men connected with the powerful Democratic investment - banking house of Lehman Brothers .
Johnson ’s first Under - Secretary of State , George Ball , who left because of increasing disillusionment with the Vietnam War , would later become a key partner of Lehman Brothers .
Johnson ’s most influential unofficial adviser was long - time and personal legal and financial adviser , Edwin L. Weisl , a New York attorney who was a senior law partner to Cyrus Vance at Simpson , Thacher & Bartlett .
Not only was this law firm the general counsel to Lehman Brothers , but Weisl himself was dubbed by Fortune magazine as “ Lehman ’s eighteenth partner . ”
Weisl had great influence at Lehman and occasionally sat in on partners ’ meetings .
He was also reputed to be the closest friend of senior partner Robert Lehman , and sat on the board of the Lehman - controlled One William Street Fund .
Another very close and influential Johnson adviser , and a consistent hard - liner on Vietnam , was his old friend Abe Fortas , a Washington lawyer and veteran New Dealer .
During the Johnson years , Fortas served as director , vice - president , and general counsel for the Texas - based Greatamerica Corp. , a giant holding company controlling several insurance companies , Braniff Airways , and two banks , including the First Western Bank and Trust Co. of California .
During the same period , Fortas was also a director and vice - president of the large Federated Department Stores .
Both Federated and Greatamerica had close ties with Lehman Brothers .
Fred Lazarus , Jr. , a top official of Federated , sat on the board of the Lehman - controlled One William Street Fund , along with Edwin Weisl .
And the only two non-Texans on the board of Greatamerica Corp. were William H. Osborn , Jr. , of Lehman Brothers , and Gustave L. Levy , a partner in the closely allied Wall Street investment bank of Goldman , Sachs & Co. Goldman , Sachs was the senior banking adviser for the Murchison Texas oil interests , a group with whom Lyndon Johnson was personally allied .
Finally , after Henry Cabot Lodge retired as the hawkish Ambassador to South Vietnam in 1967 , he was replaced by Ellsworth Bunker .
Bunker , who had been president of the National Sugar Refining Company , served as ambassador to various countries in the Eisenhower Administration , and then Ambassador to the Organization of American States under Johnson .
Bunker was connected to John L. Loeb , the Lehman kinsman who headed the investment - banking firm of Carl M. Loeb , Rhoades & Co. Loeb placed Bunker on the board of Curtis Publishing Co. , after he obtained control of that firm for Loeb , Rhoades .
Loeb also installed Bunker ’s son , John , as president of Curtis .
Furthermore , Ellsworth Bunker ’s younger brother , Arthur , had served as director of the Lehman Corporation , and of Lehman ’s One William Street Fund until his death in 1964 .
While Bunker had served Johnson as Ambassador to the OAS , he continued to sit on the board of the National Sugar Refining Company .
In late 1965 , Bunker played a crucial role in Johnson ’s massive U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic , an intervention into a Dominican civil war to prevent a victory by left - wing forces who would presumably pose a dire threat to American sugar companies in the republic .
As President Johnson ’s emissary to the Dominican Republic just after the invasion , Bunker played a decisive role in installing the conservative Hector Garcia - Godoy as president .
Increasingly , however , the power elite became divided over the morass of the Vietnam War .
Under the blows of the Tet offensive in January 1968 , Robert McNamara had become increasingly dovish and was replaced as Secretary of Defense by hard - liner Clark Clifford , with McNamara moving gracefully to take charge of the World Bank .
But , on investigating the situation , Clifford too became critical of the war , and Johnson called a crucial two - day meeting on March 22 , 1968 , of his highly influential Senior Informal Advisory Group on Vietnam , known as the “ Wise Men , ” made up of all his key advisors on foreign affairs .
Johnson was stunned to find that only Abe Fortas and General Maxwell Taylor continued in the hard - line position .
Arthur Dean , Cabot Lodge , John J. McCloy , and former General Omar Bradley took a confused middle - of - the - road position , while all the other elite figures such as Dean Acheson , George Ball , McGeorge Bundy , C. Douglas Dillon , and Cyrus Vance had swung around to a firm opposition to the war .
As David Halberstam put it in his The Best and the Brightest , these power elite leaders “ let him ( Johnson ) know that the Establishment – yes , Wall Street – had turned on the war …
It was hurting the economy , dividing the country , turning the youth against the country ’s best traditions . ”
LBJ knew when he was licked .
Only a few days afterward , Johnson announced that he was not going to run for re-election and he ordered what would be the beginnings of U.S. disengagement from Vietnam .
The foreign - policy aims of the Nixon Administration had a decided Rockefeller stamp .
Secretary of State William P. Rogers was a Wall Street lawyer who had long been active in the liberal Dewey - Rockefeller wing of the New York Republican Party .
Indeed , Thomas E. Dewey was the main backer of Rogers for the State Department post .
Dewey ’s entire political career was beholden to the Rockefeller interests , as was dramatically shown one election year when , in an incident that received unaccustomed publicity , Winthrop W. Aldrich , Rockefeller kinsman who was president of the Chase National Bank , literally ordered Governor Dewey into his Wall Street offices and commanded him to run for re-election .
The governor , who had previously announced his retirement into private practice , meekly obeyed .
Furthermore , Roger ’s law partner , John A. Wells , had long been one of Nelson Rockefeller ’s top political aides and had served as Nelson ’s campaign manager for President in 1964 .
Second - tier posts in the Nixon State Department went to financial elite figures .
Thus , the following men were successively Under Secretaries of State ( after 1972 , Deputy Secretaries ) in the Nixon White House : Elliot L. Richardson , partner of a Boston Brahmin corporate law firm and a director of the New England Trust Co. , and a man whose uncle , Henry L. Shattuck , had long been a director of the New England Merchants National Bank and of the Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York .
John N. Irwin II , partner of a Wall St. law firm ( Patterson , Belknap & Webb ) long associated with the Rockefeller interests , and whose wife was a sister of the Watson brothers family of IBM .
Kenneth Rush , president of Union Carbide Corp. , and a director of the Bankers Trust Co. of New York .
Robert S. Ingersoll , chairman of the board of Borg - Warner Corp. and a director of the First National Bank of Chicago .
Also , the Deputy Under - Secretary of State for Economic Affairs under Nixon was Nathaniel Samuels , a partner in the investment - banking house of Kuhn , Loeb & Co. , and a director of the Rockefeller - controlled International Basic Economy Corp .
Henry A. Kissinger
But of course the dominant foreign policy figure in both the Nixon and Ford Administrations was not William Rogers but Henry A. Kissinger , who was named national security adviser and soon became virtually the sole force in foreign policy , officially replacing Rogers as Secretary of State in 1973 .
Kissinger was virtually “ Mr. Rockefeller . ”
As a Harvard political scientist , Kissinger had been discovered by John J. McCloy , and made director of a CFR group to study the Soviet threat in the nuclear age .
He was soon made director of a special foreign policy studies project of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund , and from there became for more than a decade Nelson Rockefeller ’s chief personal foreign policy adviser .
Only three days before accepting the Nixon Administration post , Rockefeller gave Kissinger $ 50,000 to ease the fiscal burdens of his official post .
Nixon and Kissinger re-escalated the Vietnam War by secretly bombing and then invading Cambodia in 1969 and 1970 ; they could be sure of compliance from Ellsworth Bunker , whom Nixon retained as Ambassador to South Vietnam until the end of the war .
Apart from the Vietnam War , the Nixon Administration ’s major foreign policy venture was the CIA - led overthrow of the Marxist Allende regime in Chile .
U.S. firms controlled about 80 percent of Chile ’s copper production , and copper was by far Chile ’s major export .
In the 1970 election , the CIA funnelled $ 1 million into Chile in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat Allende .
The new Allende regime then proceeded to nationalize large U.S. - owned firms , including Anaconda and Kennecott Copper and the Chile Telephone Co. , a large utility which was a subsidiary of ITT ( International Telephone and Telegraph Co. ) .
Under the advice of Henry Kissinger and of ITT , the CIA funneled $ 8 million into Chile over the next three years , in an ultimately successful effort to overthrow the Allende regime .
Particularly helpful in this effort was John A. McCone , the West Coast industrialist whom Johnson had continued in charge of the CIA .
Now a board member of ITT , McCone continued in constant contact by being named a consultant to the CIA on the Chilean question .
President Nixon continued Johnson holdover Richard Helms as head of the CIA , and Helm ’s outlook may have been influenced by the fact that his grandfather , Gates W. McGarrah , had been the head of the Mechanics and Metals National Bank of New York , director of Bankers Trust , and chairman of the board of the powerful Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
Of the $ 8 million poured into Chile by the CIA , over $ 1.5 million was allocated to Chile ’s largest opposition newspaper , El Mercurio , published by wealthy businessman Augustin Edwards .
Edwards was also , not coincidentally , vice president of Pepsico , a company headed by President Nixon ’s close friend Donald M. Kendall .
The transaction was arranged at a quiet breakfast meeting in Washington , set up by Kendall , and including Edwards and Henry Kissinger .
After the successful overthrow of Allende by a military junta in September 1973 , the man who became the first Minister of Economy , Development , and Reconstruction was Fernando Leniz , a high official of El Mercurio who also served on the board of the Chilean subsidiary of the Rockefeller - controlled International Basic Economy Corporation .
Richard Nixon also established , for the first time , diplomatic relations with Communist China .
Nixon was urged to take this step by a committee of prominent businessmen and financiers interested in promoting trade with and investments in China .
The group included Kendall ; Gabriel Hauge , chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. ; Donald Burnham , head of Westinghouse ; and David Rockefeller , chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank .
The first envoy to China was the veteran elite figure and diplomat , David K.E. Bruce , who had married a Mellon , and who had served in high diplomatic posts in every Administration since that of Harry Truman .
After Bruce became Ambassador to NATO , he was replaced by George H.W. Bush , a Texas oil man who had served briefly as Ambassador to the United Nations .
More important than Bush ’s Texas oil connections was the fact that his father , Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush , was a partner at Brown Brothers , Harriman .
The Trilateral Commission
In July 1973 a development occurred which was to have a critical impact on U.S. foreign – and domestic – policy .
David Rockefeller formed the Trilateral Commission , as a more elite and exclusive organization than the CFR , and containing statesmen , businessmen , and intellectuals from Western Europe and Japan .
The Trilateral Commission not only studied and formulated policy , but began to place its people in top governmental posts .
North American secretary and coordinator for the Trilaterals was George S. Franklin , Jr. , who had been for many years executive director of the CFR .
Franklin had been David Rockefeller ’s roommate in college and had married Helena Edgell , a cousin of Rockefeller .
Henry Kissinger was of course a key member of the Trilaterals , and its staff director was Columbia University political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski , who was also a recently selected director of the CFR .
President Ford continued Kissinger as his Secretary of State and top foreign policy director .
Kissinger ’s leading aide during the Ford years was Robert S. Ingersoll , Trilateralist from Borg - Warner Corp. and the First National Bank of Chicago .
In 1974 , Ingersoll was replaced as Deputy Secretary of State by Charles W. Robinson , a businessman and Trilateralist .
Ambassador to Great Britain – and then moved to several other posts – was Elliot Richardson , now a Trilateralist and a director of the CFR .
George Bush , Trilateralist , was retained as Ambassador to China , and then became director of the CIA .
He was replaced as Ambassador by Thomas S. Gates , Jr. , head of the Morgans ’ flagship bank , Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. Meanwhile , Robert McNamara continued to head the World Bank .
Becoming head of the Export - Import Bank in 1975 was Stephen M. DuBrul , Jr. , who had had the distinction of being a partner of both Lehman Brothers and Lazard Freres .
James Earl Carter and his administration were virtually complete creatures of the Trilateral Commission .
In the early 1970s , the financial elite was looking for a likely liberal Southern governor who might be installed in the White House .
They were considering Reubin Askew and Terry Sanford , but they settled on the obscure Georgia governor , Jimmy Carter .
They were aided in their decision by the fact that Jimmy came highly recommended .
In the first place , it must be realized that “ Atlanta ” has for decades meant Coca - Cola , the great multi-billion dollar corporation which has long stood at the center of Atlanta ’s politico - economic power elite .
Jimmy Carter ’s long - time attorney , close personal friend , and political mentor was Charles Kirbo , senior partner at Atlanta ’s top corporate law firm of King & Spalding .
King & Spalding had long been the general counsel to Coca - Cola , and also to the mighty financial firm , the Trust Co. of Georgia , long known in Atlanta as “ the Coca - Cola bank . ”
The long - time head and major owner of Coca - Cola was the octogenarian Robert W. Woodruff , who had long been highly influential in Georgia politics .
With Kirbo at his elbow , Jimmy Carter soon gained the whole - hearted political backing of the Coca - Cola interests .
Financial contributors to Carter ’s race in the 1971 Democratic primary for governor were : John Paul Austin , powerful chairman of the board of Coca - Cola ; and three vice - presidents of Coke , including Joseph W. Jones , the personal assistant to Robert Woodruff .
If Pepsi was a Republican firm , Coke had long been prominent in the Democratic Party ; thus , James A. Farley , long - time head of the Democratic National Committee , was for thirty - five years head of the Coca - Cola Export Company .
In 1971 , Carter was introduced to David Rockefeller by the latter ’s friend J. Paul Austin , who was to become a founding member of the Trilateral Commission .
Austin was long connected with the Morgan interests , and served as a director of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. , and of Morgan ’s General Electric Co .
Other early political backers of Jimmy Carter were the Gambrell brothers , David and E. Smyth , of a family which was a major stockholder in Rockefeller - controlled Eastern Air Lines .
The Gambrell law firm , indeed , served as the general counsel for Eastern .
They , too , aided in forming the Carter - Rockefeller connection .
During the same period , Carter was also introduced to the powerful Hedley Donovan , editor - in - chief of Time magazine , who was also to be a founding Trilateral .
Rockefeller and Donovan liked what they saw , and Carter was also recommended to the Trilaterals by the Atlanta Committee of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Jimmy Carter was invited to become a member of the Trilateral Commission shortly after it was formed , and he agreed enthusiastically .
Why did the Trilaterals appoint an obscure Georgia governor with admittedly no knowledge of foreign affairs ?
Ostensibly because they wanted to hear the views of a Southern governor .
Far more likely , they were grooming him for the Presidency and wanted to instruct him in trilateralism .
Carter took instruction well , and he wrote later of the many happy hours he spent sitting at the feet of Trilateral executive director and international relations expert Zbigniew Brzezinski .
What the unknown Carter needed more than even money for his 1975 – 1976 campaign for President was extensive and favorable media exposure .

Advertisement About 50 Greenpeace campaigners , some dressed as apes , have staged a protest at two Unilever sites over the company 's use of palm oil .
The protesters went into the plant at Port Sunlight , Wirral , and Unilever House , London , early on Monday .
Campaigners left both sites about nine hours later after talks with managers .
Greenpeace claims the use of palm oil is damaging the Indonesian rainforest , but Unilever says it is leading the search for a sustainable product .
In November , the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) - which Unilever chairs - agreed criteria for sustainable palm oil production which addresses many of Greenpeace 's concerns , the company said .
" The problem is simply that demand of palm oil has exploded , " a spokesperson said .
" It is essential that all those involved sign up to agreed criteria to make sustainability work on the ground - but this is not an easy process and is taking longer than we would all like .
It was a frank exchange of views but very amicable and grown up
Unilever spokesman " Nevertheless , we remain absolutely committed to finding a solution . "
A spokeswoman for Merseyside Police said officers monitored the protesters during the demonstration , which she described as " peaceful " .
A Greenpeace spokesman said the group arrived in two vans at the front and back entrance of the Wirral site at about 0640 BST and simply walked in .
Later at 0735 BST , campaigners dressed as orang - utans scaled ladders on to a balcony at the headquarters in London .
Campaigners left both sites at about 1545 BST after a meeting with a senior Unilever manager from London .
Andy Tait , a campaign manager for Greenpeace at the Wirral protest site , said : " Unilever have promised a substantive response in the next couple of weeks and during that time we will look at other ways to keep up the pressure .
" Today has been a success in terms of keeping it on the public 's and Unilever 's agenda but the real success will be when Unilever changes their policies by not dealing with suppliers who destroy the rainforest . "
A Unilever spokesman said production at the plant in the Wirral had not been affected by the action .
" It was all very peaceful and amicable , " said the spokesman .
" One of our senior managers in London met with a Greenpeace representative today .
It was a frank exchange of views but very amicable and grown up . "
Greenpeace is urging Unilever to use its influence to stop palm oil suppliers clearing areas of rainforest - the natural habitat of orang - utans in Indonesia - to support the crop .
Palm oil is an ingredient in foods , soaps and detergents and a bio - fuel added to diesel for cars .

Israel Willing to Return Golan Heights to Syria ?
Report : Israel willing to give up Golan Heights for peace with Syria .
JERUSALEM April 23 , 2008  -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has told Syrian President Bashar Assad that Israel is willing to give up all of the Golan Heights for peace with Syria .
That 's according to a government - backed Syrian News agency report from Damascus published this morning .
The agency says Olmert passed this message to Assad through Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
For some time , reports have been circulating that both Syria and Israel have been exchanging messages through Turkish mediation .
Both Assad and Olmert have now publicly admitted to indirect communications .
The Prime Minister 's Office in Jerusalem refused to confirm or deny today 's report .
Spokesman Mark Regev told ABC
News , " We do n't comment on media reports , but Israel has clearly stated we want peace with Syria .
The prime minister has made this very clear in recent interviews .
We understand Syria 's expectations .
The Syrians understand our expectations . "
On Sunday Assad told a meeting of his Baath Party in Damascus that " friends are making efforts to renew negotiations between Israel and Syria . "
Israel occupied the Golan Heights during fighting in the Six Day War in 1967 .
The Syrian regime of Hafez al Assad , the current president 's father , came close to negotiating a return of the territory from the Israeli government of Ehud Barak in 2000 under a process mediated by President Clinton .
This process collapsed when the two sides failed to agree on the final border between the two countries .
Israel is widely thought to be demanding a significant change in Syria 's strategic and diplomatic positions before a deal can be done on the land .
Land has long been thought of as a strategic asset .
Israel is also known to be unhappy with Syria 's cosy relationship with Iran and North Korea and condemns its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories .
For many Israelis full peace with Syria should mean an end to all those relationships .
On Monday former President Carter claimed that 85 percent of the differences between the two countries have already been resolved .
He had just returned from meetings with Assad and leaders of Hamas .
During an interview with ABC News in Jerusalem , Carter said , " Assad is very eager to commence talks .
He 's very eager for the U.S. to play a key role and to resolve the question of the Golan Heights . "
But the current U.S. administration seems unlikely to embark on a peace drive with Syria .
President Bush views the Assad regime in Damascus as part of the problem in the war on terror and has accused it of destabilizing U.S. efforts to bring peace to Iraq , meddling in the internal affairs of Lebanon and backing Palestinian extremists .
Washington has been a leading proponent of economic sanctions against key figures in the regime and backs a U.N. investigation into the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Harriri , which many in the West allege was a Syrian - inspired plot .
For a creature that has to cope with several kinds of predators , it can help to have a diversified defensive strategy  adjusting appearance or behavior depending on the enemy .
Because chameleons are famous for the ability to adjust appearance , might they have such a predator - specific approach to defending themselves ?
In a paper in Biology Letters , researchers describe one chameleon that does .

2 -4-7 This priceless and invaluable educational article is a quiet ( yet explosive ) guardian as to the personal manner ( a stark reminder ) , how criminality with stealth avoids detection by creeping carefully with its invisibility upon the freedoms and rights that have eroded in just 52 years .
Perhaps we DO need another blood - letting war so as to appreciate and cherish that which follows the carnage of death and destruction .
What is it about " men " where invention and creativity ( power by default ) always appear to result in aggressive and calculated hostile behaviour ?
Capitalism is the rush ( ' surge ' ) to what was at one time a democratic Market Place , while its velocity and acceleration is more expectant than the 120 days of work that the GOPs and the DEMs can muster .
So , what is the survival opportunity of the Constitution ?
The US Constitution is not unlike that of a very simple " Project Procedure Plan " ..
There are continious milestones that will ( not can ) carry penalties if targets are delayed .
When the " Project " is complete , its " constitution " is there in black and white for all to see .
If there is neglect and no maintenance carried out when implemented , then the walls will come tumbling down .
It is the maintenance aspect of the US Constitution that needs analysis and constant monitoring .
There are people in Government and Business positions that need change as would a junky require a cocaine fix .
The only difference is that the junky is just attempting to survive ... day - to - day .
He has no covert plans and expectations
There is a philosophical system out there somewhere where the group can be the people , totally .
IIt has to emanate from individuals that are not polluted with copiousness and grandeur .
There have been many over the centuries .
" The Founding Fathers " and many since , and many many more prior ..... Socrates from Alopece to John Kenneth Galbraith , economist , diplomat and diplomatist ( the Canadian bloke ) .
Can we start with Ron Paul , maybe ?
I do n't know for I am a Brit .
Is it probable that Presidents like Vlad Putin , Chavez , Ajad ' and maybe ' Morals ' Morales have spliced together a " Constitution " of the mind where today 's Capitalism cannot exist alongside " Democracy " .
This is so obvious .
The American ( US and Can ) policies are no longer functional when the " other " parts of the World are suffiently powerful and cognisant to demand change .
The Sodom ( Hollywood ) and Gomorrah ( Tel Aviv ) days are slowly coming to an end ...( hope so , he said .. touching wood ) .
Today , historical evidence being the Memory Bank of Human Kind , has the solution .
It has to be accessed with the right " reading heads " over its platter .
See at foot of page an article on exactly the above dumbing down theme ... sent a couple of years ago for your consideration .......... Can you answer # 4 in the Geography section ...:-) )
This is what my Dad called the " General " paper .
Apparently , there were at the time individual tests on each subject ... plus another 6 subjects not listed .
Of course , they had a little thing called an Empire at the time .
So much work .. so little time .

Subject : RE : " Dumbing down " :.. Excellent example for 11 year olds ... alas it 's 1898 in Britain
This is an excellent example ( below ) of the continuing saga in the intentional and premeditative " dumbing down " of our children 's education .
It verifies all that Rense.com and its educated contributors have been thinking , highlighting and illustrating to the readers for at least the past three years .
From that time period ( 1898 test below ) and then the necessary passage of exactly 50 years to when yours truly was 11 years old , I would at that point in time , possibly , would have been able to answer approximately 60 % of the questionnaire ... that is , losing 40 % in those 50 years on the presumption that I would have the questions 100 % correct ...50 years earlier .
Namely , losing linearly approximately 0.8 % per year .
This amounts to the deflection or loss of neuron transmitters ( by TV , Game Boy , new Kennedy " play " game , etc , etc ) on the order of 106 years at 0.8 % per annum . ( calculator please ) = 85 % ( from 1898 to 2004 ) .
This indicates that by deductive reasoning , today , our children are running around their schools and neighbourhoods quarrying legal " Tommy Guns " with an intelligence level of an 1898 child that has been confined to an Institution for the ' Mentally Challenged '
Do you get the impression that the last few paragraphs above appear somewhat confusing in its deductibility and rhetoric ... even wrong through lack of education ? :-) )... Maybe it should be added to the below questionnaire ..
" Where is the logic in these paragraphs " .
Assuming they taught Integrated Calculus and the Freudian Transference Theory ( if then in existence ) .. to the 11 year olds .......... who knows .

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government can do nothing in the short - term to ease the pain of a spike in fuel prices that is threatening to tip the economy into recession , a senior official at the Department of Energy said on Monday .
“ It is clear that there is no silver bullet here .
It took us decades to get into the current energy situation and it is going to take us some time to get out of it , ” the DOE ’s acting deputy secretary Jeff Kupfer told Reuters at the Global Energy Summit in Houston .
U.S. retail gasoline prices averaged $ 3.98 a gallon on Monday , up more than 25 percent from a year ago tracking a dramatic surge in the price of crude oil , according to auto and travel group AAA ’s daily survey of about 100,000 service stations .
The head of the U.S. Energy Information Administration told Reuters in New York on Monday that gasoline prices will peak at an average of $ 4.10 this summer and crude prices are likely to stay over $ 100 a barrel through 2009 .
Oil prices have risen six - fold since 2002 to around $ 130 a barrel as rising demand in China and other developing nations strains supply .
Economists have said that the spike in oil prices could trigger a recession in the United States , already hard hit by a housing slowdown and credit crunch .
Kupfer said the Department of Energy was seeking to navigate the United States out of the energy crunch in the long - term by promoting alternative fuels , energy conservation , and additional production of conventional fuels around the globe .
He added that the United States was asking OPEC to raise output to help meet the rising demand from Asia .
“ The more supply that OPEC can put on the market , the better it would be for all of us , ” he said .
OPEC has repeatedly rebuffed calls for more production , saying that supplies are currently adequate .

My Dollar Plan readers have lots of great ideas when it comes to saving money .
I asked readers to share their money saving tips .
The responses were terrific !
One of my favorites is Brian ’s idea to wait at least 30 days before making major purchasing decisions .
There are so many times when I decide I no longer need to buy something that was at the top of my list last month !
From energy savings to selling your stuff and using the library to setting up your accounts automatically and everything in between , here is a recap of the tips to save money .
Money Saving Tips
Fill your fridge .
Lower your electricity bills by stocking your fridge with water bottles .
The less empty space you have in your fridge , the less cold air will escape whenever you open it .
– by Investing & Passive Income Bring your lunch to work .
It can save you about $ 10 - $ 20 a week .
If you add that up , it comes down to saving at least $ 520 a year .
– by Christine Use price comparison websites .
They make it so much easier to find the stuff you want to buy and get it for the lowest price .
– by Katrine Cover windows in the winter .
Have 1/4 ″ sheets of plexiglass cut to the size of your windows ; during the winter install on the inside of your windows with an airgap ( created by using foam insulation strips ) in between .
Use wood strips to hold in place .
It minimizes loss of heat and it is a great sound barrier !
– by stngy 1 Wait before purchasing .
Wait at least 30 days before making major purchasing decisions .
It will help you truly think about if you need it or should buy something .
– by Brian Install an energy system .
Earlier this heating season I had a Climate Energy free watt System installed .
It ’s a combined heat and power system for the home and it saves a bundle on electricity .
– by MITBeta Cancel your land line .
Save money everyday by using a cell phone and skipping the land line .
– by Patrick Challenge yourself to save every day .
I started a 30 - day challenge called “ A Dollar A Day ” .
– by dreamfool Open your windows .
During the spring and fall , if you do n’t have a programmable thermostat , turn off the air conditioner completely and open up your windows .
This is simple , but if you do it everyday you can go quite some time without having to run it , and get some fresh air in the process as well .

Save your coins .
We empty our pockets every day and put any and all change in a jar .
We have a “ spend no coins ” rule in our household .
If we must spend money we always use cash and we always drop the change in a jar .
We keep a running “ guess ” as to how much we have accumulated !
The person with the closest guess come holiday time gets a week off from normal household chores .
– by Natalee A. Use auto - debit for loans .
I called my student loan company to see if there was anything I could do to reduce my interest rate .
Having them auto - debit the minimum drops the rate a quarter of a percent .
– by sara l Sign up for a library card .
I ’m savings anywhere from $ 30 to $ 50 a month on book and DVD expenses !
– by Sarah Shop online with Ebates .
Then use PriceProtectr to take advantage of any price reduction .
In addition , save to buy what you want instead of putting it on a credit card or an installment plan .
– by Pinyo Hang clothes out to dry .
Last summer , I totally offset my air conditioning bill by choosing not to use my dryer .
Not only did it save me money , but I really enjoy being out in the fresh air !
– by Bekki Just ask .
Call everyone you pay a bill to and ask them for lower rates .
This can be applied to cell phones , cable , internet , credit cards , loans , etc. – by Tom Sell your stuff .
Grab up all the old DVDs , Books , and CDs in your house that you do n’t use anymore and sell them on the secondary market .
– by PT
Use the bathroom at work , not at home .
– by Mr. Stupid Stockpile groceries .
Match coupons with sales , stockpile the bargains and eat from your fridge or pantry .
– by Grace Use craigslist .
If I see a book I really like , I try to get it through my college library or the free inter-library book loan system .
I also check the “ books ” section of my local craigslist on a daily basis – sometimes it has ridiculously good deals .
– by GL Use Freecycle.org .
I found an old blender for a project and saved myself at least $ 15 .
– by lpkitten
Tell others about your goals .
I talked to my friend who works at the grocery store about the rising costs of food .. and how I was making my own bread …
He came to my home with 15 loaves of bread !!
The store was going to throw them away because they were “ mismarked ”
Do n’t be shy about frugality !!
– by Just a Flipflop Mom
Use less detergent .
You can often use half the amount of detergent that ’s “ recommended ” and still get your clothes clean .
– by Jane Make savings a bill .
Make transfers from your paycheck to savings into a “ bill . ”
The way I see it , my automatic savings plan is like paying a bill , only I ’m paying it to myself .
Treating the money this way discourages using it for any other reason other than to put it into savings .
– by Foxie Do n’t drive during lunch .
I stay in the office to have lunch two – three times a week .
It cuts down on my gas and with the prices these days … – by Amy Limit groceries to the size of the bag .
I take a reusable bag to the grocery store that will hold just the items on my list .
That way I ’m not tempted to buy something I do n’t actually need .
– by deepali Round up on debit card purchases .
When I use my debit card I round up the charge to the next dollar and record it in a little note book I have .
Then at the end of the month I reconcile the money and deposit all the “ change ” left over from the debit card transactions !- by Yackie
Take a mini - budget with you .
Since I do n’t keep my monthly budget with me , once I ’ve paid the bills I jot down what I have left for each section ( gas , groceries , eating out ) in a small left hand column in my checkbook and update it as I spend .
Now I can quickly peek in my wallet to see if I ’m ‘ allowed ’ to go out for dinner , or whether I ’d better find something to make at home …it ’s been very handy and a ’ splurge ’ saver .
– by Jennifer Use energy at night .
I just started doing laundry and dishes after 8 pm or before 10 am .
This is saving me only $ 5 / month , but every little bit helps !
– by Christin Borrow from friends .
We borrowed a dvd from a friend instead of renting or buying and had a little snack from our own fridge !
Way cheaper than using gas to drive to the theater / rental place , paying for a movie , and paying for a snack .
Plus I get to check out all the cool blogs as the movie plays !
( I ’m a multi- tasker . ) – by Rachel Complete a family meal plan .
This not only saves money by not scrambling at the last minute and busting the budget on take out , but also saves on the stress in busy families !

May 31 , 2008
A U.S. Marine Corps general has decided not to bring criminal charges against two officers who led their unit on a March 2007 killing spree that left 19 Afghan civilians dead and 50 more wounded .
The decision infuriated Afghanis .
" This is too much , " said Kubra Aman , an Afghan senator from Nangarhar .
" First , they say it�s a mistake , and after that , they let them go without charges . "
A United Nations spokesperson , Aleem Siddique , made the same point in more diplomatic language .
" It is disappointing that no one has been held accountable for these deaths , " said Siddique .
The UN " has always made clear that there must be increased transparency and accountability of all parties to this conflict if we are to retain the trust and confidence of the Afghan people . "
By contrast , the U.S. media barely noticed .
For its part , the New York Times featured an article on Afghanistan a few days later celebrating a " fierce battle " by a Marine unit that drove Taliban fighters outside of the southern town of Garmser .
The article referenced last March�s massacre�but not the Marines� decision not to press charges .
Instead , the Times quoted a NATO officer talking about the " huge optimism " of the town�s residents for the operation �while downplaying the death of a 14 - year - old boy and eight civilians injured during the battle , and the fact that the Marines will be moving on in a couple weeks , thus allowing the Taliban to return .
Why the media indifference ?
Because the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan is still seen as the " good war . "
If there is one point of agreement between Republicans and Democrats , and even sections of the antiwar movement , it is that the U.S. war on Afghanistan is a legitimate response to the September 11 attacks , mainly aimed at bringing the perpetrators to justice �unlike the occupation of Iraq , which is viewed , even by sections of the Washington establishment , as " unnecessary , " " illegal " and " based on lies . "
George Bush and the Pentagon are currently weighing a " surge " of two additional brigades �about 7,000 troops �to Afghanistan .
The Democrats� likely presidential nominee Barack Obama has repeatedly spoken in favor of sending more troops to Afghanistan �he calls the occupation of Iraq a " distraction " from the war the U.S. should be fighting .
Two additional brigades would bring total American troop strength in Afghanistan to more than 40,000 and boost the proportion of U.S. soldiers from about half to two - thirds of NATO forces .
In 2007 , because of an expansion of bombing campaigns on villages , deaths of Afghans topped 6,500 , the largest number since the war began more than six years ago .
Deaths of U.S. soldiers last year , at 110 , were also up , while other nations contributing troops to NATO forces lost a combined 111 .
The level of death and destruction in Afghanistan , combined with the horrible toll that the war has exacted on U.S. soldiers , including those who return alive but forever scarred by the stress of combat , should be reason enough to oppose the war in Afghanistan .
But this is only a starting point .
If you look more closely at what the U.S. has done in Afghanistan and plans to do in the future , it�s clear that the rhetoric about upholding democracy and making the world safer is �as in Iraq �a smokescreen to justify pursuing imperial ambitions .
From the start , the U.S. cloaked its motivations for going to war in Afghanistan with talk about saving ordinary people in Afghanistan �in particular , women suffering abject oppression �from the rule of the Taliban .
But a few years before , the U.S. had quietly backed the ascendance of the Taliban , in the hope that the hard - line regime would impose order �and facilitate the oil corporation Unocal�s plan to build a pipeline through the country .
No doubt , some Afghans hoped the U.S. invasion would get rid of the Taliban .
But those hopes turned to bitterness and resentment as the brutality of the occupation �and the savagery of the warlords that Washington has depended on to maintain its grip �became all the more evident .
As the veteran anti-imperialist and author Tariq Ali wrote :
There have been numerous incidents of rape and rough treatment of women by [ NATO ] soldiers , as well as indiscriminate bombing of villages and house - to - house search - and - arrest missions .
The behavior of the foreign mercenaries backing up the NATO forces is just as bad .
Even sympathetic observers admit that " their alcohol consumption and patronage of a growing number of brothels in Kabul�is arousing public anger and resentment . "
To this could be added the deaths by torture at the U.S. - run Bagram prison and the resuscitation of a Soviet - era security law under which detainees are being sentenced to 20 - year jail terms on the basis of summary allegations by U.S. military authorities .
All this creates a thirst for dignity that can only be assuaged by genuine independence .
Journalist and filmmaker John Pilger reports that members of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan ( RAWA ) , bitter opponents of the Taliban , make the same point .
" We , the women of Afghanistan , only became a cause in the West following September 11 , 2001 , when the Taliban suddenly became the official enemy of America , " Marina , a member of RAWA , explained to Pilger when he visited Afghanistan .
" Yes , they persecuted women , but they were not unique , and we have resented the silence in the West over the atrocious nature of the Western - backed warlords , who are no different .
They rape and kidnap and terrorize , yet they hold seats in [ U.S. - backed Hamid ] Karzai�s government .
" In some ways , we were more secure under the Taliban .
You could cross Afghanistan by road and feel secure .
Now , you take your life into your hands . "
In time - honored fashion , the U.S. has held up a country�s terrible history of poverty , repression and inequality as the pretext for imperial aggression that only aggravates poverty , repression and inequality .
The problem is not a lack of money or troops , as George Bush and Barack Obama suggest , but the goal of the war itself .
The U.S. has never sought to " liberate " Afghanistan , but to dominate it and turn it into a stable , U.S. - friendly outpost in Central Asia .
What the U.S. really wants , says Tariq Ali , is " to construct an army able to suppress its own population but incapable of defending the nation from outside powers ; a civil administration with no control over planning or social infrastructure , which is in the hands of Western NGOs ; and a government whose foreign policy marches in step with Washington�s . "
This explains why the U.S. government pressured Hamid Karzai into signing an agreement in May 2005 granting the U.S. the right to install a huge military presence in the country forever �over and against protests that erupted against the agreement before the ink was even dry .
U.S. policymakers understand that Afghanistan , like Iraq , is a strategic beachhead that can be used to spread Washington�s geopolitical influence throughout Central Asia .
Sometimes , they even spell this out explicitly .
An essay in the NATO Review , for example , sounds more like a threat than a call for security and peace : " In the 21st century , NATO must become an alliance founded on the Euro - Atlantic area , designed to project systemic stability beyond its borders �
There can be no systemic security without Asian security , and there will be no Asian security without a strong role for the West therein . "
The " humanitarian - security " case made by the U.S. establishment needs to be rejected �just as the case for the occupation of Iraq has been rejected as a pack of lies to justify Washington�s drive to control oil resources and project its power throughout the Middle East .

The newspapers are predictably filled with articles about how 52 U.S. soldiers died in Iraq last month – the highest toll since September .
Iraqi civilian casualties are also said to be at the highest level since August .
These losses are being used to cast aspersions on claims of progress in Iraq .
Even one death is too many and 52 deaths is tragedy multiplied 52 - fold .
But let 's keep some perspective .
As the icasualties .org website makes clear , for better or worse , April was still one of the lighter - casualty months during the long war in Iraq .
More important , casualties cannot be looked at in a vacuum .
A spike in casualties could be a sign that the enemy is gaining strength .
Or it could be a sign that tough combat is under way that will lead to the enemy 's defeat and the creation of a more peaceful environment in the future .
The latter was certainly the case with the casualty spike during the summer of 2007 .
( More than a hundred soldiers died each month in April , May and June . )
Those losses were widely denounced as evidence that the surge was n't working , but in fact they were proof of the opposite .
At the time , troops were engaged in hard fighting as part of Operation Phantom Thunder that eventually cleared most terrorists out of Anbar , Baghdad , Diyala , Babil and other provinces , leading to dramatic reductions in violence over the last year ( more than 80 % before the recent fighting ) .

Clearly we can’t very well tear down all of the world ’s old skyscrapers for not being environmentally friendly – that kind of approach would itself be ( ironic and ) wasteful .
At the same time , many of these buildings are projected to last for decades ( or centuries ) more .
So what is the solution for making them green now ?
One rather clever proposal involves adding an auxiliary environmental layer to the existing structures that could house gardening and natural wind power production spaces .
This particular proposal calls for a few basic modules with particular functions that could be combined in various ways to create networks of green functionality outside of and between various skyscrapers .
Structural rigidity would rely to some extent on the structures they would be attached to as well as their complex geometries and interconnections .
The beauty of modularity is that plug - and - play systems like these are highly adaptable for future use and modules could , theoretically , be added and removed as - need during the lifetime of the structures .
Taken as a whole a series of such modules would be able to provide both the indirect benefits mentioned above as well as direct benefits to adjacent skyscrapers including potential wind and sun regulation to reduce energy needs .
Of course the entry shown above is still purely theoretical .
Nonetheless ( and regardless of whether or not such a thing is ever truly built ) it points toward new possibilities beyond the old paradigm of build and destroy and rebuild – a possible ( and more ecological ) approach that involves a middle path .
Neil Young Takes His Hybrid-Electric ' 59 Lincoln For A Test Drive

The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Hot on the heels of Matt Damon taking an electric vehicle out for a spin , rocker Neil Young hit the road with his still - under - development green vehicle : A 1959 Lincoln Continental Mark IV that ’s being turned into a beautiful serial - electric hybrid by John Goodwin .
Young has been working on having the car transformed since the announcement of the project last October .
“ Johnathan and this car are going to make history , ” said Young in an interview with The Wichita Eagle .
“ We ’re going to change the world , we ’re going to create a car that will allow us to stop giving our wealth to other countries for petroleum .
And we ’re going to do it right here in Wichita , a great place that I now love , where people know how to make things , and make things happen . ”
Of course , there have been a few bumps along the road .
The $ 120,000 project almost ended in disaster during a recent test - drive with Young and Goodwin .
From the article ,
“ Because there is no gas pedal , Goodwin had to drive with his left hand , with no power steering , while twisting half around and turning an acceleration knob in the back seat with his right hand .
‘ And we just about crashed it , ” Goodwin said .
At K - 96 and Webb , as they approached the entrance ramp , Goodwin turned the knob the wrong way , and the car leaped toward the back end of another car .
In a micro-second , Young , from the passenger seat , stomped the brake , averting disaster .
‘ Still needs a little work , ’ Goodwin said . ”

Scientists can now tell us what happened in nearly every millisecond of the big bang .
Robert Matthews takes us through the first crucial moments [ please note , superscript numbers in this article are represented with the prefix ^ ]
Using observatories on the earth and in space , astronomers have been able to study the nature of the cosmos in unprecedented detail .
By analysing the motion of distant galaxies , they have discovered that the whole cosmos is expanding under the influence of forces unleashed at its birth in the big bang .
Combined with studies of the radiation left over from that primordial explosion , they have found that the universe was born 13.7bn years ago , give or take 200 m years .
Pinning down the date of creation with such precision is impressive , but scientists have gone much further .
They have begun to piece together the whole history of the universe , from the big bang to the present day .
The very earliest moments are still the focus of intense research , and the final word is not yet in .
Even so , the timeline of events now emerging is every bit as astounding as the creation myths of the world 's religions .
10 ^ - 43 seconds
Known as the Planck Era , this is the closest that current physics can get to the absolute beginning of time .
At this moment , the universe is thought to be incredibly hot , dense and turbulent , with the very fabric of space and time turned into a roiling morass .
All the fundamental forces currently at work in the universe - gravity , electromagnetism and the so - called strong and weak nuclear forces - are thought to have been unified during this stage into a single " superforce " .
10 ^ - 35 seconds
The so - called Grand Unification Era , at the end of which the superforce begins to break apart into the constituent forces we see today .
Around this time so - called inflationary energy triggers a dramatic burst of expansion , expanding the universe from far smaller than a subatomic particle to far larger than the cosmic volume we can see today .
In the process , the primordial wrinkles in space - time are smoothed out .
10 ^ - 32 seconds
The energy dumped into the universe by the end of inflation leads to the appearance of particles of matter via Einstein 's celebrated equation E=mc^2 .
Initially a mix of matter and antimatter , most of the particles annihilate each other in a burst of radiation , leaving behind randomly scattered pockets of matter .
10 ^ - 11 seconds
The so - called Electroweak Era , when the last two fundamental forces still unified with one another - electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force - finally split , leaving the universe with the four separate forces we observe today .
10 ^ - 6 seconds
As the universe continues to expand , it becomes cool enough to allow the familiar particles of today 's matter , protons and neutrons , to form from their constituents , known as quarks .
200 seconds
At a temperature of one billion degrees celsius , protons and neutrons start to come together to form nuclei , the charged cores of atoms .
Within 20 minutes , the temperature of the universe has become too cold to drive the process , which ceases with the formation of the nuclei of hydrogen and helium , the simplest and most common chemical elements in the universe .
The formation of all the other elements - including the carbon , oxygen and nitrogen needed for life - will emerge with the first massive stars millions of years later .
300,000 years
The universe has cooled to about 1,000C - cool enough for electrons to pair up with nuclei to form the first atoms .
By the end of this so - called Recombination Era , the universe consists of about 75 % hydrogen and 25 % helium .
With the electrons now bound to atoms , the universe finally becomes transparent to light - making this the earliest epoch observable today .
200 m years
Small , dense regions of cosmic gas start to collapse under their own gravity , becoming hot enough to trigger nuclear fusion reactions between hydrogen atoms .
These are the very first stars to light up the universe .
0.5bn - 1bn years
The force of gravity starts to pull together huge regions of relatively dense cosmic gas , forming the vast , swirling collections of stars we call galaxies .
These in turn start to form clusters , of which one - the so - called Local Group - contains our own Milky Way galaxy .
9bn years
The force of gravity trying to slow the cosmic expansion begins to lose out to the anti-gravitational effect of " dark energy " , a mysterious force which has been accelerating the cosmic expansion ever since .
9.1bn years
A region of gas and dust from exploding stars in the Milky Way galaxy starts to collapse under its own gravity , forming a small star surrounded by a disk of rocky material and gas .
Swarms of giant chunks of debris form within the disc , collide and merge - forming the Earth , moon and other planets .

Before the big bang
The big bang is the ultimate extreme event - one where conditions are so intense that even our best theories of physics break down .
Yet some theorists now believe they have found ways of pushing back even further , to the ultimate question : what came before the big bang ?
To do it , they have had to take on one of the greatest challenges in physics : the marriage of Einstein 's theory of space , time and gravity , general relativity , with quantum theory , which describes the subatomic world .
Only then can they hope to describe conditions at the big bang , when all space and time was compressed into a volume far smaller than a proton .
Early attempts to unify the two theories are starting to reveal some intriguing hints .
Recent calculations suggest that close to the big bang , the fabric of space and time was so contorted that it flipped gravity into reverse , producing a repulsive force .
If correct , this would mean that the big bang was n't the start of the universe at all .
Instead , it was merely a " big bounce " , the latest in an endless series stretching back into the infinite past .

Everything the religious right wing is against , I am for !
The shell specimens dated back to 1996 and the earlier ones had weighed in at 20 micrograms .
But Roberts observed that as the specimens became more recent , the weight of the shells had fallen .
When her last specimen , from 2005 , weighed in at just 10 micrograms , Roberts barely dared to breathe .
" Wow , what is going on ? " she asked herself .
A halving of shell weight in just one decade was a real worry .
Roberts 's still unpublished research is just one reason why her collaborator , Dr Will Howard , from the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre , this week convened an extraordinary meeting of Australia 's leading marine scientists in Hobart .
For three days , the 50 scientists , along with colleagues from America and New Zealand , focused their collective minds on a threat that has emerged , it seems , from out of the blue : the growing acidification of our oceans .
These scientists now know that burning fossil fuels and massive land clearing are not just warming the planet and raising sea temperatures , they are also changing the chemical make up of the oceans .
A vast amount of the carbon dioxide humans have pumped into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution has been absorbed by oceans .
A new report by the Antarctic research centre , released at the Hobart meeting , says that about half the fossil fuel carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by humans has now dissolved into the oceans .
If we keep pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at the current projections , by 2100 the ocean acidification will be three times that experienced at the end of the glacial period , 15,000 years ago .
The chemistry is basic .
The ocean is a weakly alkaline solution .
When carbon dioxide sucked in from the atmosphere dissolves in sea water , it forms a weak acid , making the ocean more acidic .
For sea life with fragile shells , corals and countless other sea creatures , a more acidic ocean could be disastrous and have unknown impacts right up the marine food chain .
" It 's going to affect every part of Australia 's marine environment , every bit of water that 's in contact with the atmosphere , " Howard told the Herald .
" If I could sit Kevin Rudd down tomorrow , I would say : this is an inevitable and inexorable consequence of our putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
It 's not going to stop .
What we need to do quickly is get some research together where you can anticipate the ecological impacts of this . "
So concerned were scientists at the meeting they decided to launch a Hobart declaration on ocean acidification .
While their final communique is being thrashed out , all present were alarmed by the growing evidence that the oceans are changing , with consequences so far immeasurable for marine life .
Using the most basic calculation , Australia controls some 8 million square kilometres of ocean .
Those waters generate about $ 52 billion in national wealth , according to the CSIRO , including a $ 2.5 billion fishing industry , and vast tourism dollars .
Just as valuable is the extraordinary array of marine life that protects the coastlines , supports the reefs , and stops algae from choking the beaches .
What the scientists are asking is this : how quickly will the oceans reach the point where some vital sea creatures will not survive ?
How many will be able to adapt to the new conditions ?
What happens to all this marine life when rising acid levels combine with the rising sea temperatures caused by global warming ?
Right now , the best predictions are that within 50 to 60 years , a serious rise in ocean acidification is likely to leave some species struggling to survive , especially corals and creatures with fragile shells .
" There are distinct chemical thresholds and once they are crossed , these organisms ' shells would tend to dissolve , " Howard explains .
" As the ocean approaches those thresholds , the organisms ' ability to make those shells are compromised .
There is a zero sum game . "
Australian marine scientists working in the Southern Ocean now unexpectedly find themselves on the front lines in this new crisis .
For a range of complex reasons , the impacts of ocean acidification are expected to be felt first in the deep , cold , Antarctic waters , which will become a giant lab lesson for the rest of the world .
One of these frontline scientists is Dr Martin Riddle , a marine biologist with the Australian Antarctic Division .
Back in December , Riddle and his team made an extraordinary discovery off the Antarctic coast near the Mertz Glacier .
Between 600 and 800 metres underwater they came upon a stunning cold water coral community as colourful as anything on the Great Barrier Reef .
" We were blown away by it , " Riddle recalled .
The discovery made news around the world , but Riddle believes it might one day return to the headlines for quite different reasons than its beauty .
Rising acidification of the Southern Ocean is likely to overtake the beautiful reef in 50 to 60 years .
" This could be a dramatic change that nobody but me would have known about , " says Riddle .
" If we had n't gone down to find it , we would n't have even known about it .
But it 's really the canary in the cage .
It 's the early warning system .
Ocean acidification is going to affect cold , deep areas first .
They will indicate what is likely to happen elsewhere into the future .
That is really the importance of this particular site . "
If the bottom of the food chain around reefs like this begins to change , he explains , we will see changes in the rest of the food chain .
" Does it worry me ?
Of course it does . "
Disturbing findings about the impacts of acidification - some definite , many preliminary - were debated at the Hobart meeting .
A series of early lab tests on krill , a vital food source for the Southern Ocean whale population , found that as acid levels rose krill kept reproducing , but the offspring developed deformities .
While the research is incomplete and inconclusive , it underscored anxiety about Australia 's need for a major research effort to grasp the enormity of the problem .
Professor Maria Byrne , from Sydney University , warned that ocean acidification must be examined in tandem with climate change , especially rising sea temperatures , because the most damage to marine life would come from a combination of stresses .
Last year , CSIRO researchers reported Australia 's southern east coast could be hardest hit by global warming , with sea temperatures rising by up to two degrees by 2070 .
East of Tasmania , sea temperatures are already rising faster than the global average , increasing by more than two degrees since the 1940s .
" We know NSW is a global climate change hot spot , " says Byrne .
" If you look … from Cape Byron all the way down to Tasmania , you 'll see the red on the map of the CSIRO climate change model . "
Byrne had previously examined the impacts on sea urchins , " the cows of the sea " that keep NSW shores free of algae .
First , she heated their water to 24 degrees , equivalent to the hottest contemporary NSW summer sea temperature .
The sea urchins survived OK .
But when she raised the water temperature to 26 degrees , things quickly went bad .
" I got a 75 per cent mortality rate .
The embryos started to die after three days . "
And when Byrne added a higher acid level to the water , all hell broke loose .
" It 's the two stresses together , " she said .
" It caused massive mortality within hours . "
Five years ago , almost no prominent scientist in Australia was talking about ocean acidification , including those who worked on the peak United Nations scientific body , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Indeed , the panel devoted just one line to the topic in its Nobel Prize - winning report .
That is now rapidly changing .
A bill was introduced last year to the US Senate for a $ US30 million ocean acidification research program .
Next week , a similar European project will be launched .
The Australian scientists , led by Howard and the CSIRO 's Dr Bronte Tilbrook , hope to galvanise political and community support behind a national research effort to help not only Australia but the whole South Pacific region adapt to a profound and enduring change to marine life .
Even if carbon dioxide emissions are radically reduced now , Howard and Tilbrook explain , the oceans will take hundreds of years to recover .
But right now , the biggest cause for concern , says Howard , is that it is starting to look like some of the changes are happening much faster than anyone anticipated .
Collaborative Software Initiative ( CSI ) , the company that brings like - minded organizations together to work on collaborative software at a fraction of the cost , today announced the release of the first open source , web - based infectious disease reporting and management system .
The disease reporting and management system , which is being piloted in Utah , will be adaptable in all 50 states and available under an open source license later this year .
It is designed to support local health departments in the early detection and investigation of individual cases and local clusters of communicable diseases , while simultaneously meeting the state and federal needs of outbreak control , disease surveillance and epidemiologic research .
JRuby
Mike Herrick ,
InfoQ :
We are about 6 months into an iterative ( based on Lean Software Development ) two year initial build of the application .
So far it is 100 % JRuby .
Its currently all web application , but we have a very extensive roadmap that includes analytics , a disconnected client , and substantial integration .
We are undecided on the technology for analytics , disconnected client , and integration .
We 'll want to use JRuby and Java as much as possible .
InfoQ :
We are currently using Java 6 , JRuby 1.1.1 with the following gems :
* Rails 2.0.2
* hpricot
* mechanize
* postgres-pr
We are currently using the following Rails plug-ins :
* auto_complete
* validates_date_time
* model_auto_completer
* haml
* calendar_date_select
* betternestedset
* RAA soundex ( actually a library : http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/soundex/)
We also have a plug - in in development named acts_as_auditable and may spin it out as open source before we open the entire project if it pans out .
We are using RSpec and Selenium Grid ( also uses RSpec ) for testing , and Hudson for Continuous Integration .
We are using NetBeans and vim for development .
We are using PostgreSQL for the database .
We looked at Solr for full text search , but ultimately favored PostgreSQL Full Text Search as it met our needs and we did n't want to introduce another moving part .
We are currently using Tomcat for our servlet engine .
It is working well .
We have heard good things about Glass Fish and would like to take it for a spin at some point .
Warbler has been terrific .
Nick Sieger really eased some pain with that ( original Goldspike based packaging has now been deprecated ) .
A small contribution we made to the JRuby community was to provide some specific documentation on how to use Warbler with Rails 2 when it first was released in the JRuby wiki .
I wrote a blog post on that pointing at it the wiki page and it still gets dozens of hits a day from lots of large companies .
I 've taken that as a good sign of JRuby uptake
InfoQ :
Collaborative Software Initiative ( CSI ) engages the power of community to build project teams and provides the central project management function for developing Collaborative Software , including development , testing and ongoing support for the code .
CSI delivers the software to a broader base of customers under the open source licensing or Software as a Service ( SaaS ) model .
There are currently over 100 participants in our public health community .
The community is currently made up of Subject Matter Experts ( SMEs ) and Developers .
The SMEs in this case are epidemiologists , nurses , and medical doctors .
There is a core team of 15 SMEs and Developers .
5 members of the Core Team are developers .
We also have 2 part time developer contributors .
Of the 7 developers , 4.5 are actively writing JRuby .
Our senior developers on the project are Ed Copony and Pete Lacey .
Plug : we are looking for another core developer .
InfoQ :
At the end of the day , developing serious software is really hard even under ideal situations like ours .
We hired known performers for the development team .
For better or worse , our experience with JRuby , Ruby , and Rails was n't terribly deep although we had some .
Ross Cooperman , the leader of another Collaborative Software Initiative project in the Financial Services vertical had deep Ruby and Rails experience with MRI .
That was really useful in the early days of the project in steering us in the right direction .
So there certainly have been learning curve issues .
Ruby and Rails are productive once you conquer the learning curve , but it does n't come over night .
We have had some trying days , but are having far less of them now .
Along the way we 've turned to the JRuby mailing lists , wiki , and IRC .
The community has been very supportive .
When Rails 2.0 first came out I found a bug in Goldspike ( the JRuby Rails servlet ) : http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-1879.
We worked out a fix with the community quickly over a weekend .
In the days leading up to our first release in March , JRuby 1.1 was about to ship and we found a bug that was going to prevent us from releasing our application with JRuby 1.1 as we had hoped : http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-2314.
The JRuby community rallied around it and squashed it and we were able to release with JRuby 1.1 .
InfoQ :
We chose JRuby over MRI for a number of reasons : * Ease of deployment * Every enterprise on the planet runs Java *
Our development team has a Java heritage *
Our roadmap for the project is extensive and we did n't believe we could do it with Ruby alone .
We wanted our fall back language to be Java rather than C .
InfoQ :
More than anything , we have been impressed with the drive of the JRuby community .
It is very ambitious and also pragmatic .
The core team is comprised of some spectacular developers .
The focus seems to be on the right things .
Better Java integration , constant performance improvement , and collaborating with the JVM folks on improving the JVM for all dynamic languages .
This is all good .
I ran this question past Pete and Ed to get their input as well .
Their input has to do with Rails & not JRuby specifically .
We 'd like to see better multi- model support , possibly via nested has_many throughs and has_one throughs .
We 'd also like to see more consistent validation support , including rolling up validation errors to the top model .
And finally more flexible URLs formats , maybe including URI Templates .
In our experience to date , Rails is holding up .
As I mentioned above , JRuby and Rails is a very productive environment , but we are building a large application here - its a ton of work regardless of what technology you are using .
We are definitely seeing significant productivity benefits over straight Java or Java and Spring , but Rails is not a silver bullet .
That said , there are many innovative tools and ideas in the Ruby community and in Rails that have provided for many moments of delight , even in the midst of tackling sometime frustrating learning curves .
InfoQ :
In our experience , JRuby just works .
We have yet to have an issue with JRuby vs. MRI compatibility .
There are of course some gems that have not been ported to Java yet , but we have not had a need to use them .
InfoQ :
We have n't had any problems externally with our partners as its just Java to them .
Our current deployment package contains database scripts and a .war file .
As we build out the roadmap there will be more moving parts , but certainly no more than a typical JEE application .
Collaborative Software Initiative is a very meritocratic company .
At the beginning of the project we debated using Ruby ( MRI ) , Python , Java & Spring , JRuby & Rails & Java , JRuby & Merb & Java , PHP etc .
It really came down to momentum .
The Ruby language has a lot of momentum .
There is a lot of diversity in Ruby virtual machine implementations and collaboration between the language implementors .
This is a very good thing in our view .
We looked at all the options , assessed the communities , had a healthy debate and then voted .
We were very impressed with the trajectory of JRuby .
In our view , it was ready for production use .
We ultimately decided that given this project and our team , we were most comfortable with JRuby , Rails , and Java .
We certainly have nothing against the other options , but we made our choice and are happy with the results so far .
JRuby and JRuby on Rails continue to being adopted by many projects .
After Mingle Oracle Mix or Sun 's rewrite of mediacast.sun.com , a new project using JRuby on Rails has surfaced .
One thing to note further down in the press release : the project uses .
We talked to Program Manager at the Collaborative Software Initiative , to talk about the experience of using JRuby for the project .
Could you give a quick overview what kind of software you implemented and which parts you implemented using JRuby ?
Is it mostly a web site or are there any ( business ) logic parts involved as well - are they also done using JRuby ?
What 's your list of technologies you used for JRuby and Rails ?
What servlet engine do you use ?
Do you use tools like Warbler or others ?
According to the information in the above link , the project 's team is rather large - how many people were involved with writing JRuby code ?
What problems did you encounter while working with JRuby on Rails - and how did you solve these problems ( tools , workarounds , bug reports to JRuby team , ... ) ?
What 's the reason of using JRuby over regular Ruby ?
Are there any features or improvements you 'd like to see implemented in JRuby or the JRuby on Rails software stack ?
Are there Ruby language or standard library features you 'd like to see in the future ?
Did you have any problems in getting JRuby accepted as implementation technology ( by management or the client ) ?
If yes : how did you get around these problems ?
Have you used JRuby on Rails for non-trivial web applications ?
10 state ask delay in same - sex ruling CALIFORNIA Attorneys general want to wait until November vote

The dispute over whether the California Supreme Court should put its ruling legalizing same - sex marriages on hold until voters consider the issue in November was joined Friday by attorneys general from 10 states , who say a postponement might save them from legal headaches over whether to recognize California marriages .
In papers filed with the court , the attorneys general - all Republicans - said that if the ruling is implemented as scheduled June 17 , it would subject their states to a profusion of lawsuits involving gay and lesbian residents traveling to California to get married .
Each of the states has a law barring recognition of same - sex marriages performed elsewhere .
However , unlike Massachusetts - the only other state to legalize same - sex marriages - California allows residents of other states to wed here even if the marriage would not be permitted in their home state .
" An inevitable result of such ' marriage tourism ' will be a steep increase in litigation " over whether the couple 's home state must recognize their marriage , said Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff , author of the brief .
He said a court might have to decide , for example , whether the couple could file a joint state tax return , whether one spouse could refuse to testify against another , or whether one could sue over the other 's wrongful death .
The situation will become murkier , Shurtleff said , if California voters approve a constitutional amendment Nov. 3 that would overturn the state high court 's ruling and declare that only opposite - sex marriage is valid or recognized in the state .
Courts in other states , as well as California , would then have to decide whether same - sex marriages performed before Nov. 3 were valid .
Sponsors of the amendment have submitted more than 1.1 million signatures on petitions ; 694,354 valid signatures are needed to qualify for the ballot .
Delaying implementation of the ruling until after the election would spare the states from " premature , unnecessary , unnecessarily difficult , and therefore unduly burdensome litigation in our courts , " Shurtleff said .
He was joined by the attorneys general of Alaska , Colorado , Florida , Idaho , Michigan , Nebraska , New Hampshire , South Carolina and South Dakota .
Conservative organizations opposed to same - sex marriage filed similar requests earlier in the week , while the plaintiffs in suits that challenged California 's law defining marriage as between a man and a woman - 23 gay and lesbian couples and the city of San Francisco - opposed any delay .
The plaintiffs were joined Thursday by state Attorney General Jerry Brown , whose office defended the same - sex marriage ban in court but who said postponing implementation would withhold rights from couples who are now entitled to them .
San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera criticized the 10 states ' request for a delay Friday and said he would submit opposing arguments next week .
" To further delay constitutional rights to gay and lesbian partners based on political conjecture as to whether or not an amendment will pass - or even qualify for the ballot - would be both unprecedented and inhumane , " Herrera said in a statement .
The state high court has until June 16 to decide whether to put its ruling on hold until November .
In response to a ( somewhat ridiculous ) proposal that we " sue OPEC " over high oil prices , Mark Thoma writes :
[ I ]t 's unlikely that [ monopoly power ] is the factor behind the run-up in prices .
Monopoly power explains the level of prices , i.e. why price is $ 8 rather than $ 5 , but it does n't explain the change in prices , i.e. why the price would change from $ 8 to $ 12 .
There are ways to tell this story , e.g. a war or some other event giving a cartel the cover it needs to raise prices and blame it on external factors , but I do n't think that 's what 's going on in oil markets today , at least I do n't think this is a significant factor behind the oil price increases .
I think there may have been a change over the last few years in the market power of oil producers , for structural reasons .
Traditionally , OPEC has suffered from the usual problem that makes large cartels unwieldy : Under agreements to restrain production , members individually have an incentive to cheat and sell larger - than - agreed upon quantities at still artificially high prices .
But that assumes that the production quotas are significantly beneath the capacity of most members to produce .
More subtly , it also assumes that each country gains by producing more rather than less oil , if cartel prices are maintained .
Both of those assumptions may no longer hold .
As the global oil market has grown , demand may have outpaced individual countries ' capacity to supply , either because investment in new projects has not kept pace , or because nations have hit domestic " peak oil " .
( See Indonesia for an extreme example . )
Other countries may desperately need money in order to fund current spending , so it is widely known they will produce as much as they can , regardless of quotas .
Ironically , as long as the total capacity of sure - fire cheaters and constrained suppliers is well below global demand at the cartel 's target price , the certainty of their output may enhance the ability of discretionary producers to control the quantity produced .
It 'd always be easier for a cartel of five or six producers to exercise market power than a cartel of , say , thirteen .
But that 's especially true when cartel members have little incentive to cheat .
Normally , we think of governments as spendthrifts , always eager to spend an extra dime unless constrained by tax revenues or debt markets .
That 's obviously a mischaracterization of today 's most important oil producers , whose governments spend far less than the oil revenue they receive .
For Saudi Arabia , selling a barrel more of oil is a portfolio choice : revenue from the marginal barrel will be saved , not spent , so the question becomes whether it is wise to shift some of the Kingdom 's current allocation out of oil and into some asset that can be purchased with currency .
For countries that have very little non-oil savings , mere diversification would encourage oil sales .
It is unwise to have all ones eggs in one basket , and oil producers remember all too well that world prices can go down as well as up .
They 'd want to store their national wealth in an " efficient portfolio " , one that maximizes their return on risk by including a variety of investments .
But as oil producing nations have accumulated vast reserves of financial assets , switching from oil - in - the ground to stocks , bonds , or bank accounts is no longer so sure a bet .
Real interest rates on " safe " dollar assets are currently negative , both in US and home country terms , and the outlook for safe euro assets is uncertain at best .
Central banks and sovereign wealth funds of oil - producing nations already hold hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Western financial assets .
They might already have reached or exceeded what they view as an optimal allocation of their national wealth into these securities .
Of course , producers are still not well diversified , and it 's pretty clear that sovereign wealth funds are looking for alternative assets that might hedge their exposure both to oil and Western paper .
But allocating into less liquid , unfamiliar categories of assets is slow work if you want to do it well .
Perhaps current oil revenues outstrip oil producers ' capacity to find good investment opportunities , and they view oil - in - the - ground as a better second - best asset than dollars in the bank .
Ten years ago , oil producers did not have vast hoards of dollars and euros , and required oil revenue to meet budgetary needs .
World demand was low enough that cheating by OPEC members could corrode producer pricing .
It was hard to exercise market power .
Now , cheaters do n't matter , and discretionary producers may be indifferent or worse to the prospect of selling a barrel more of oil at current prices .
( In a sense you might not call this market power at all , as price equals marginal cost , that is to oil producers , the assets they can buy for the dollar price of a barrel of oil are worth no more to them than a barrel of oil left in the ground . )
Brad Setser recently noted that ...
[ T ] here are two clear paths that could end the current “ oil up , dollar down ” pattern .
Weakness in the US economy could drag down global oil demand , pulling both the dollar and oil down .
Asia 's 1997 - 98 crisis led both Asian currencies and the price of oil .
Or a rebound in the US economy could push up the dollar while adding to oil demand .
In 2000 , a booming US pushed up oil prices and the dollar .
Ironically , a strong , healthy US economy might also push oil prices down , even while increasing US and world demand for oil !
The price of oil to discretionary producers is not measured in dollars , but in the future purchasing power of the assets dollars can buy .
If oil producers expected US financial assets to appreciate in value more quickly than oil ( in terms of what they want to buy ) , President Bush would n't have to look anyone in they eye to get the producers to invest in new wells .
However , if that 's not the case , then the rate of production might be determined more by the political costs of failing to produce than by world demand or current - dollar prices .
But ... for US dollar assets to appreciate faster in oil - producer purchasing power than oil itself , those assets would have to represent claims ( direct or indirect ) on future goods that producers want to buy , that is investment in tradable goods and services .
Unfortunately , Brad is probably right to suggest that a " rebound " in the US economy would drive oil prices up , since we 've come to believe that more GDP is always better , sectoral composition does n't matter , and producing tradables is for the little people .
Federal stimulus checks might give a zetz to GDP , but in and of themselves they do nothing to make claims on American assets worth buying .
10 Mistakes in Icon Design
Author : Denis Kortunov
12 February 2008
It is much easier to criticize somebody else ’s work than to create something cool yourself .
But if you apply a systematic approach to criticizing , make a numbered list and prepare illustrations , it will be regarded as a fully - fledged analysis !
In my opinion , icon design is undergoing a transitional period .
On the one hand , screen resolutions are increasing , hence enhancing icons .
On the other hand , we still have good old pixels .
Icons sized 16 ×16 and even smaller are still widely used .
And so , here are the most commonly observed mistakes in icon design …
# 1 Insufficient differentiation between icons
Sometimes within one set of icons , we have icons that look alike and it is very hard to understand what is what .
If you miss the legends , you can very easily get the icons mixed up .
Icons from the Utilities section in Mac OS X . I am always getting them confused and launching the wrong application .
The problem is aggravated by having small size icons displayed on screen .
# 2 Too many elements in one icon
The simpler and more laconic the icon , the better .
It is preferable to keep the number of objects in a single icon to a minimum .
Nevertheless , Microsoft ’s designers , inspired by the new format of icons featured in Windows Vista , decided to go big and drew bloated icons to justify their bloated budget :
Each icon presents us with a mini-story with an intertwined plot .
The problem is that in small size you are unable to work out what is depicted .
Even in larger sizes , it is not always that easy to decipher the icons .
# 3 Unnecessary elements
An icon should be easy to read .
The fewer elements it has , the better .
It is better if the whole image is relevant and not only part of it .
Therefore , you have to pay attention to the context of using icons .
Let us take for instance some database icons :
At first glance everything looks alright .
But if this application ( or a separate toolbar ) deals only with databases , we can ( and should ) remove the unnecessary part :
The sense is not lost here but the icons become much more discernible .
Here is a real - life example of unnecessary elements occurring in BeOS 5 icons :
Ticks here are absolutely superfluous .
By the way , why are they done in red ?
# 4 Lack of unity of style within a set of icons
It is a unity of style that unites several icons into a set .
The uniting property can be any of the following : color scheme , perspective , size , drawing technique or a combination of several such properties .
If there are only a few icons in the set , the designer can keep some rules in his head .
If there are many icons in the set and there are several designers working on them ( for instance , icons for an operating system ) , then special instructions are created .
Such instructions describe in detail how to draw an icon so that it fits straight into the set .

# 5 Unnecessary perspective and shadows in small icons
Progress does not stand still : interfaces have gained the potential to display semi- transparent objects , lost the limitation on the number of colors and there is now a trend towards 3D icons .
But is it really all that useful ?
Not always !
Especially if we are talking about icons sized 16 × 16 or smaller .
For example , let us take the application manager from GNOME 2.2.0 ( RedHat 9 ) :
Perspective in icons of such minute size is unnecessary and even counter - productive .
And here is the application manager from Windows XP :
As standard , icons in Windows XP are given a two - pixel black shadow ; but in 16 × 16 size the shadow appears too large and makes the icons look dirty .
The Address Book icon looks especially bad in this set .
# 6 Overly original metaphors
Selecting what is to be displayed in an icon is always a compromise between recognizability and originality .
Before a metaphor ( image ) is developed for an icon it is wise to see how it is done in other products .
Maybe the best solution lies not in coming up with something original but rather in adopting the existing solution .
An example of excessive originality is the bin icon in OS / 2 Warp 4 , which is not actually a bin at all but a shredder .
Another problem with choosing a shredder is that there is no one well - known type of shredder out there .
The icon appears very much like a printer with an octopus hidden inside .
What is more , it is absolutely unclear how a full bin would be displayed according to this metaphor .
# 7 National or social characteristics not being taken into account
It is always necessary to take into account the conditions in which your icon is going to be used .
An important aspect here is national characteristics .
Cultural traditions , surroundings and gestures can differ radically from country to country .
Let us suggest that we need to draw an icon for working with e-mail .
It makes perfect sense to use a metaphor of real paper mail .
A mailbox for example .
These images are courtesy of the Wikipedia article entitled Post box .
The answer can be found in the manual on creating icons for Mac OS X : “ Use universal imagery that people will easily recognize .
Avoid focusing on a secondary aspect of an element .
For example , for a mail icon , a rural mailbox would be less recognizable than a postage stamp . ”
The idea of using a stamp is great but the use of the eagle red- tailed hawk image is definitely questionable .
However , you need to account not only for national features …
That reminds me of something funny .
Once , we needed an icon for a data filter , which is often portrayed using the metaphor of a funnel .
It was drawn like this :
The client ’s response was as follows : “ I do not really understand why for a filter , you drew an icon shaped like a Martini glass ! ”
# 8 Images of real interface elements in icons
The manual on creating icons for Mac OS X warns us : “ Avoid using Aqua interface elements in your icons ; they could be confused with the actual interface . ”
But all in vain !
For instance , take a look at the following icon :
You reach out to click on the radio button but end up clicking the whole icon !
Here is an interesting example from the OmniWeb browser interface :
Pay attention to the Previous and Next buttons , a rare type of button with legends underneath .
Oops !
They are not buttons at all , they are icons !
# 9 Text inside icons
This mistake is commonly seen in application icons .
Clearly the first thing that comes to mind when working on an application icon is to adapt the application ’s logo .
What is so bad about the text inside the icon ?
Firstly , it is directly language - related and so impedes localization .
Secondly , if the icon is small , it is impossible to read the text .
Thirdly , in the case of application icons , this text is repeated in the name of the application .
# 10 Outside the pixel framework
As a rule , this problem occurs if you use a vector editor for drawing icons .
In large size everything looks pretty and clear ; but in reality the icons are small , and under rasterization anti-aliasing frets the objects ’ borders .

NFL Official Jim Quirk Fined for Roughing the Packer ( Video )
NFL game officialwas fined the equivalent of last Sunday 's game check , $ 8,150 , for tackling Green Bay Packer linebacker
ESPN reports that Quirk was summoned by football commissioner Roger Goodell and Executive VP of football operations Ray Anderson .
After meeting with Quirk , they informed both Mike McCarthy and Nick Barnett of their decision .
The incident on Sunday occurred at Soldiers Field in Chicago , where the Green Bay Packers went up against the Bear .
Quirk agressively grabbed Barnett around the neck and pulled him to the ground .
Packer coach Mike McCarthy remarked , " I 've never seen anything like that in all my years . "
Apparently Quirk was involved in a similar incident with Atlanta Falcon 's fullback Jason Snelling on a kickoff return on December 16 .
The two incidents were examined as part of Commissioner Goodell 's decision to fine Quirk .
Nick Barnett 's agent , Chuck Price , said that his client was satisfied with the ruling and fine and would not pursue the filing of a grievance with the NFL .

Polish priests face prison terms over plagiarized sermons
THE GUARDIAN
Poland ’s 28,000 Roman Catholic priests have been told by church authorities that they may be fined if they are discovered to have plagiarized their sermons from the Internet , and could even face up to three years in prison .
The Church has published a self - help book on writing sermons to lure parish priests away from the growing habit of stealing the words of their fellow clergy .
Father Wieslaw Przyczyna , the co-author of To Plagiarize or Not to Plagiarize , said the guide had been written to address what had become an increasingly common problem as more churches put their sermons online .
Przyczyna , a sermon expert at Krakow ’s Pontifical Academy of Theology , said the book ’s aim was to shame culprits and prompt them to confess what they had done .
“ Unfortunately the practice has become more usual than not , ” he said .
“ But if a priest takes another priest ’s words and presents them as his own without saying where he got them from , this is unethical and against the rules of authorship . ”
The Church authorities have said they will start to carry out systematic checks in an attempt to clamp down on the practice .
Church heads are also discussing the possibility of teaching trainee priests about the concept of intellectual property .
The main culprits are said not to be older priests , who often do not have access to the Internet , but their more youthful counterparts .
Young priests turn to the Web when they are less than proficient at public speaking , and particularly on a Saturday night when they are panicking about having nothing to say at mass the following morning , Przyczyna said .
Tuesday did n’t get above 60 degrees , and that will be the theme for much of the rest of the week .
Scattered rain showers join the colder …
The first person to call me a self - hating Jew was my father .
It was in the autumn of 1967 .
Dad was 39 , a successful businessman who was also , along with my mother , active in the US civil rights and anti-war movements .
I was the oldest of his five children and had already , at age 14 , intoxicated by the ideals of justice and equality , begun my career as a footsoldier of the left .
It was not only the first time I had been called a self - hating Jew , it was the first time the phrase , the idea , entered my consciousness , and it was a shock .
As a young man , against the family grain , my father had taken an interest in social and especially racial justice and at college was drawn to the Communist party , which is how he met my mother , who was the product of a very different strand of the New York Jewish tapestry .
This was in the heyday of anti-communist hysteria , of which my parents were first victims , then accomplices .
After giving a speech against the Korean war at a student conference in Prague in 1950 , dad was denounced as a traitor .
His passport was seized .
His father told the press that if his son had said such things , he was no son of his .
It was in this period , I think , that he came to rely implicitly on my mother , the girlfriend who stood by his side when his life seemed most precarious .
They were married in 1952 and a year later I was born .
Shortly after that , the FBI came knocking on the door .
After months of pressure , from his own family as much as from the repressive organs of the state , my father , with my mother by his side , just as before , agreed to name names .
" To this day we regret the mutual decision we made , " my mother wrote .
" It has been a source of incredible pain and shame . "
When my father , 45 years after the event , lay dying , sapped by chronic pain and humiliating dependence , he went over it yet again , as he had with me many times .
" I fucked it up , " he moaned .
There was no absolution anyone could give him .
All the other contributions he had made seemed outweighed by this ineradicable betrayal .
In the early 60s , having a wife and five kids , a big suburban home and a blossoming career as a real estate developer , was not enough , and he and my mother threw themselves into the struggle in the American south , raising money , organising meetings , sheltering young activists , supporting boycotts and pickets .
In 1964 , my dad went to Mississippi to deliver supplies to the beleaguered grassroots movement .
It was a frightening time : they were now killing whites as well as blacks .
Years later I learned that my mother was furious with my father over this adventure .
She told him he was trying to compensate for his earlier sin , that he had no right to put his life at risk , to put this need for redemption above his obligation to his children .
But in my eyes , the Mississippi visit , followed by his participation in the Selma march for voting rights in Alabama a year later , made my father a hero , along with the other heroes of the movement , which for me in those days included everyone from Martin Luther King to Stokely Carmichael .
All of which partly - but only partly - explains why , when he lowered the boom on me in the autumn of 1967 by suggesting I was a self - hating Jew , it came as an uncushioned blow , an attack out of nowhere , or out of a place of which I was previously unaware .
Initially , I was anxious about going to a new synagogue .
I did n't know what to expect as we turned down the driveway .
The building was purpose - built and sleekly modern , the parking lot crammed with station wagons .
Dad escorted me to my classroom , where , at once , I felt relief .
The room was filled with kids I knew from school .
There was the one who played quarterback , the one who made funny noises , the one who had all the Batman comic books .
So they were Jewish too .
I had n't known that .
There was a map of Israel alongside a map of the US , but apart from that it looked like the classrooms I knew from school , with colourful posters and a big blackboard .
I felt at home .
We all did .
We were the most comfortable Jews that had ever walked the planet .
Not for us the longing of exile , the pain of dispersal .
We were Americans in America .
And we were , in particular , suburban American Jewish kids in the early 1960s , blithely self - confident about our privileges and our position in the world .
Sublimely safe .
That was the beginning of my eight years of Reform Jewish education , which sputtered to an end when I was 15 and declared , in my confirmation speech , that God was dead and man was condemned to be free .
From an early age I conceived of myself as a rationalist and though I made spasmodic efforts at belief , I never felt a divine presence .
During " prayer " , I was acutely aware of the gap between what I was supposed to be thinking and what was actually going through my head .
But in the end what alienated me from the synagogue was not the make - believe of the afterlife or the all - seeing omnipotence of an invisible God .
Not in this synagogue .
Here the absolutes were kept in the background .
God was there , mentioned in the prayers , but he had been discreetly updated and denatured .
No one seemed overconcerned about his judgment .
So what was the creed we were taught in Sunday school ?
It was not about God .
It was about the Jews .
A singular people who had given wonderful gifts to the world and whom the world had treated cruelly .
A people who were persecuted .
A people who survived .
A people who triumphed .
Despite the Holocaust , we were not a nation of losers , of victims .
There was a redemptive denouement .
There was Israel , a modern Jewish homeland , a beacon to the world .
A shiny new state with up - to - date , Coke - drinking people like us .
Liberals , like us .
Bearers of democracy and civilisation , making the desert bloom .
A little America in the Middle East .
Israel was both our own cause , a Jewish cause , and a moral cause , a universal cause .
Like America .
A land without people for a people without land .
Like America .
That was the gift we received in Sunday school - an extra country .
For us there were two nations and , best of all , we did n't have to choose between them .
As Jews and Americans , we enjoyed a double birthright and a double privilege .
The coming home of the Jews to the land of our forefathers completed the epic saga stretching back to Genesis and ensured it ended with a huge upswing in mood .
From near - annihilation in the Holocaust to the pride of statehood in a few short years .
We took this less as a sign of the divine inspiration of the ancient prophets than as another manifestation of the order and justice that generally prevailed in our world .
A testament to progress and the Jewish mastery of progress .
Thanks to America and Israel , the Jews were safe at last .
We could visit Israel and work on a kibbutz , like a grown - up summer camp .
We were taught to revere Ben Gurion and his heir , the Jewish - American farm girl Golda Meir .
In our Sunday school textbooks the Israelis looked like us .
And the country they were building looked familiar , with modern buildings and girls in jeans .
These were Jews who read books but also drove tractors and tanks .
As always , the Jews had enemies .
Israel was menaced by Arabs ( not Palestinians , a word never uttered in our synagogue ) .
They were exotically attired bedouin - people who did not have or want a home .
In our Sunday school texts , they appeared swarthy , coarse , ignorant , duplicitous .
These descendants of Pharaoh and the Philistines seemed curiously ungrateful and irrational .
For no reason at all , they hated us .
I was intrigued by the Jewish holidays .
Simchas Torah , a year marked out in chapters of a book .
Succoth , the Jewish Thanksgiving , a harvest festival , a deeply exotic idea to kids who knew food only from supermarkets .
Purim , the revenge of integrity .
Yom Kippur disturbed me ( I knew I should atone for something but was n't sure what ) , but Pesach was special .
The matzoh balls and latkes my grandmother brought .
Elijah 's cup .
Most of all , it was the story that pulled me in - that epic of liberation , with the oppressed triumphing over their oppressors , right over might .
An intoxicating narrative , as exciting and satisfying as the food .
People should be careful when they teach this stuff to kids .
It sinks in deeper than they realise .
It can even turn someone against the land promised them in the Pesach story .
For several years I took twice - weekly Hebrew lessons in preparation for my barmitzvah .
Then came a year of lavish celebrations , services , dinners , dances , in marquees on suburban lawns and ballrooms in midtown hotels .
Mountains of gifts .
Cheques or bonds or little stakes in IBM or ITT .
Compared to some , my barmitzvah was a low - key affair ; my mother disapproved of the conspicuous display made by our neighbours .
I got the cheques , I got a set of left - handed golf clubs , but better yet I got elegant illustrated editions of Thomas Paine 's Rights of Man and Thoreau 's Walden .
Within weeks of my barmitzvah , every word of Hebrew vanished from my head .
The language had been learned solely to complete a public performance , a rite , that had little meaning for me .
I certainly did not feel that I had become a man , an adult , a member of a congregation , that I was enfranchised .
Instead , I began to look for and find some of that sense of growth , of emergence as an autonomous human being , in politics , in the world of the left , in battles against racism and for civil liberties .
Soon I just could not stop talking about the Vietnam war and how it was wrong on every count .
This , in 1966 , did not make me popular .
So why was I so determined to pursue the course ?
Was I just showing off , calling attention to myself ?
Yes , I was .
But there were other ways to do that and I did not choose them .
In Sunday school , Israel 's victory in the 1967 six - day war was a great moment of Jewish pride .
I do n't remember much thanking of God , and no mourning for the victims on either side , just a sustained note of elated triumph .
To cap all our other Jewish achievements , to confirm our eminence , we had proved ourselves masters in war .
Six days to defeat Arab armies attacking from all sides , to sweep across the Sinai , unite Jerusalem , drive the enemy back across the Jordan .
No one spoke then , not in my hearing , of the beginning of an occupation .
We had redrawn the lines on the map .
That was our prerogative .
That was justice .
We were unbeatable and we were righteous .
Israel married moral virtue and military strength - another sign that we lived in an age of order and progress .
When a friend who liked to tease me about my anti-Vietnam war views suggested I might not support Israel against the Arabs , I was outraged and offended .
I 'm not sure exactly when or how I began to doubt .
But I remember what happened the first time I expressed that doubt .
It was a few months after the ' 67 war .
A special visitor came to our Sunday school class .
He was in his early 20s , with thick fair hair falling over his forehead , a snappy sports jacket and polished loafers .
Some of the girls whispered that he was cute .
He had an accent but it was nothing like our grandparents ' accents .
He looked and dressed like us but he had been a soldier in a war and that made him an alien being .
Smiling , he perched himself casually on the front of the teacher 's desk and told us about the remarkable achievements of the Israeli army .
He told us that the Arabs had planned a sneak attack but had met with more than they bargained for .
They were bad fighters , undisciplined soldiers .
And they were better off now , under Israeli rule .
" You have to understand these are ignorant people .
They go to the toilet in the street . "
Now something akin to this I had heard before .
I had heard it from the white southerners I 'd been taught to look down upon .
I had heard it from people my parents and my teachers described as prejudiced and bigoted .
So I raised my hand and when called upon I expressed my opinion , as I 'd been taught to do .
It seemed to me that what our visitor had said was , well , racist .
I felt the eyes of the teacher and the other kids turn on me .
They were used to me spouting radical opinions but this time I had gone too far .
Angrily , the teacher told me I did n't have any idea what I was saying and that there would be no discourtesy to guests in his classroom .
The young Israeli ranted bitterly about Arab propaganda and how the Israelis treated the Arabs better than any of the Arab rulers did .
I can't remember how long it was after that that I decided to share this experience and my thoughts on it with my family .
This was something I was usually encouraged to do .
We were sitting around the dinner table - all seven of us .
I launched into my story about the Israeli in Sunday school and how what he said was racist .
I had been thinking about the matter and now added , for my family 's benefit , a further opinion .
It was wrong for one country to take over another , or part of another , by military force .
If the US was wrong in Vietnam - and that was a given around our dinner table - then Israel was wrong in taking over all that Arab land .
I was reasoning by analogy , and nobody had yet told me that some analogies were off limits .
For some time I remained unaware that my father was listening to me not with approval but with rising fury .
When he barked , " Enough already ! " the shift was disturbingly abrupt .
Like my Sunday school teacher , he made me feel that I had said something obscene .
Then he drew a breath and seemed to soften .
" I think you need to look at why you 're saying what you 're saying , " he said , and then the softness vanished .
" There 's some Jewish self - hatred there . "
I felt then - and still feel now , when I look back - deeply and frustratingly misunderstood .
My motives had nothing to do with self - hatred or any feeling about being Jewish .
Nor did they have anything to do with compassion for a people - the Palestinians - about whom I knew nothing .
I was merely following , as best I could , and in typical 14 - year - old fashion , what seemed to be the dictates of logic .
If in following them , the results appeared to defy assumptions , then that just made them more curious and compelling .
Judging people by their colour or religion was wrong .
Racism - making a generalisation about a whole people , stereotyping a whole people - was wrong .
Taking over other countries was wrong , even if they attacked you ( it was years before I learned that it was Israel that had launched this war , justified at the time by Abba Eban , American liberal Jewry 's favourite Israeli , as a " pre-emptive " strike ) .
Among the shibboleths I was brought up on was the belief that " my country right or wrong " was wrong .
No one liked to insist more than my dad that if you really loved your country you criticised its flaws .
Surely that also applied to religion , and " my religion right or wrong " must also be wrong .
I was only trying to apply general principles to a particular case .
An exercise in logic .
An exercise in teenage stubbornness .
But I was unprepared for the response , with its implication that I did not know myself , coming from my father 's lips .
An attack on my selfhood .
I was startled and bewildered by the phrase " Jewish self - hatred " .
I did n't know what it meant .
I had n't imagined that Jews would hate themselves , or that anyone would think that I hated myself .
The charge seemed so far - fetched , yet so personal .
And so bitterly unfair .
Burning from head to toe , I threw down knife and fork and left the table in a huff , pounding up the stairs to my room , where I hurled myself on my bed and wrestled with my frustration .
Some might by now have concluded that the roots of my anti-Zionism lie in oedipal trauma .
For sure , this was a deeply distressing incident .
Later , I looked back on it as my first political disagreement with my father .
Later still , as one of a number of raw episodes in our relationship , most of which had nothing to do with politics .
Now , looking again at the history behind this incident , I see more clearly why the opinions I was expressing would have infuriated nearly everyone in my father 's milieu in those days .
To me , they were a logical development from the agreed shared ground of democratic liberalism , but to liberals of my father 's generation they were an insolent abrogation of that shared ground .
Without in the least intending to , I had breached a taboo .
Today , as cracks show in the presumed monolith of Jewish backing for Israel , increasing numbers of Jews are interrogating and rejecting Zionism .
Nonetheless , the existence of anti-Zionist Jews strikes many people - Jews and non-Jews - as an anomaly , a perversity , a violation of the first clause in the ethical aphorism of Hillel , the first - century rabbi and doyenne of Jewish teachings : " If I am not for myself , who will be for me ? "
Zionism is an ideology and a political movement .
As such it is open to rational dispute .
Jews , like others , might view the Jewish claim to Palestine as irrational , anachronistic , and intrinsically unjust .
They might consider the Jewish state to be discriminatory or racist or might object - on political , philosophical , or even specifically Jewish grounds - to any state based on the supremacy of a particular religious or ethnic group .
As Jews , they might reject the idea that Jewish people constitute a " nation " , or at least a " nation " of the type that can or should become a territorial nation - state .
Or they might have concluded on the basis of an examination of Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians that the underlying cause of the conflict was the ideology of the Israeli state .
Any or all of the above should be sufficient to explain why some Jews would become anti-Zionists .
But that does n't stop critics from placing us firmly in the realm of the irredeemably neurotic .
Whenever Jews speak out against Israel , their motives , their representativeness , their authenticity as Jews are questioned .
We are pathologised .
For only a psychological aberration , a neurotic malaise , could account for our defection from Israel 's cause , which is presumed to be our own cause .
Anti-Zionist Jews are not and do not claim to be any more authentic or representative than any other Jews , nor is their protest against Israel any more valid than a non-Jew's .
But " If I am not for myself " , then the Zionists will claim to be for me , will usurp my voice and my Jewishness .
Since each Israeli atrocity is justified by the exigencies of Jewish survival , each calls forth a particular witness from anti-Zionist Jews , whose very existence contradicts the Zionist claim to speak for all Jews everywhere .

" Dems Plead With Bush on Iraq
" By ANNE FLAHERTY " WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Democratic leaders told President Bush on Friday that it 's not too late to change course in Iraq and pleaded with him not to hand the war off to the next president .
" ' We believe there is still time for you to recognize that a change in strategy is necessary to repair the grave damage done to our nation 's security , ' the Democrats wrote .
" The letter was intended as advance rebuttal to next week 's testimony by Gen. David Petraeus , the top military commander in Iraq , and Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador there .
Petraeus and Crocker are expected to say the recent buildup in troops has succeeded in improving security but that more time is needed before more U.S. forces can be withdrawn in significant numbers .
" The Democrats said this approach is unacceptable and that they would pursue an alternative policy through legislation .
But they face an uphill battle .
" Lacking a veto - proof majority , Democrats failed both last year and this year to force Bush to withdraw troops .
The only guarantee to end the war would be for Congress to cut off money for troops while in combat — a position that not enough Democrats support and which Republicans universally oppose . "
Here 's the thing .
Not a single Democrat or Republican has ever supported or ever will support " cutting off money for troops while in combat . "
What in the world could that possibly mean ?
I picture a bunch of Marines engaged in a firefight making amo runs but running into trouble because an ATM wo n't work .
This is pure nonsense .
It is an absolutely indisputable fact that loading up every soldier , mercenary , and contractor , and all their gear , and shipping it all back to the United States would cost a teeny fraction of the cost of maintaining the occupation for another year .
Every sane person understands that without the funding to continue the occupation , the Pentagon would bring everyone home rather than ceasing to provide them with weapons and food .
Yes , of course , Cheney - Bush would misappropriate funds to continue the occupation , but if THAT were blocked , the Pentagon would bring people home , not deprive them of uniforms or radios .
Yes , of course , the Pentagon dumps the bulk of our money into corrupt war profiteers while shortchanging the troops , including on body armor .
But the Pentagon is not going to abandon them to their deaths to save the plane fuel to bring them home .
It is another indisputable fact that the Pentagon will be unable to deny a single soldier needed body armor if they are all brought home , because they will not need body armor anymore .
They will need other care , but they can't get it until they 're brought home .
The Democrats in the House or the Senate could cut off the funding for prolonging the occupation , the funding for Halliburton , the funding for killing and dying , the funding for endangering us all with an endless bloody hated occupation .
And they could fund a withdrawl if they wanted to go along with the pretense that that 's needed , that the cost is n't pocket change to the Pentagon .
Just the Senate or the House would be sufficient , and either one is perfectly achievable .
The House recently said No to telecom immunity , shocking the pundits .
It can say No to Iraq funding .
In fact , the leadership can simply refuse to bring a bill to a vote , just as they did with telecom immunity .
It would take a discharge petition with a majority of congress members signing it to get around the leaership showing such , you know , leadership - and that would be virtually impossible .
In the Senate , Harry Reid could simply announce that the funding is over , and it would be over .
And 41 senators could block any attempt to pass the funding , with or without Reid .
So , the media 's assertion as fact that not enough Democrats support something that has never been tried is not playing straight with us .
It is an improvement , however .
For over a year , most stories have failed to even mention the possibility of blocking the funding .
Mentioning it , if only to dishonestly dismiss it , is a step in the right direction .
People all over the country are refusing to buy the lie , and are organizing to ask their congress members to vote
No and to lobby the leadership not to bring Iraq funding to a vote .

Marina Silva will never forget the day the bulldozers rolled up on her family 's doorstep .
It was the beginning of the 1970s and in the isolated Amazon community of Bagaço , where she was born , Silva , then about 12 , looked on curiously as work began on a major highway to link the Brazilian rainforest with the rest of the country .
Shortly afterwards , her relatives began to die .
First two younger sisters , then her uncle and finally her cousin : all victims of a malaria epidemic imported by the road builders .
" I do n't know if I was conscious that the road was bringing all that , but it made me write on my own flesh the consequences of what it meant to mess around with nature without giving the slightest attention to the need to look after it , " she remembers .
Fast - forward to January 2003 .
Following the historic election of Brazil 's first working - class president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , Marina Silva was named the environment minister of South America 's largest country , thrusting this former rubber tapper , who was virtually illiterate until her teens , on to the front line of Brazil 's battle against deforestation - and of the global fight against climate change .
Environmental groups rejoiced at her nomination .
She was a woman from the forest , who understood the dangers inherent in destroying it .
Last Tuesday , however , the fairytale came to an abrupt end .
After just over five years as environment minister , Silva resigned following a succession of acrimonious disputes with fellow ministers and businessmen who accused her of stalling major development projects in the Amazon and hindering the Brazilian economy .
In her short resignation letter , Silva cited " the growing resistance found by our team in important sectors of the government and society " .
The same groups that had heralded Silva 's rise to power immediately opened fire on the government .
" It 's time to start praying [ for the rainforest ] , " said Sergio Leitao , the director of public policy for Greenpeace in Brazil , claiming the government had " now made it clear that the idea of development at any cost is what will win out " .
Lula responded by insisting that his government would not stray from its quest to protect the Amazon and appointed another high - profile environmentalist , Green party founder Carlos Minc , as his new minister .
But aside from Silva 's numerous enemies in the world of agri-business , few believe her departure bodes well for the future of the world 's largest tropical rainforest .
So why did she walk away ?
And what does her dramatic exit mean for the future of the Brazilian Amazon and , indeed , for the rest of the world ?
On Tuesday , exactly a week after her resignation , a weary - looking Silva , 50 , is unable to pinpoint a single cause for her decision .
" Throughout these five years I faced numerous moments of great tension but they did not mean that the actions I was implementing lost strength , " she says .
However , last week the situation changed .
" At this moment , in my perception , I had lost the strength to carry on doing these things . "
Silva is officially between jobs ( she will return to her seat in the senate at the end of the month ) , but in her third - floor apartment in the capital , Brasilia , surrounded by half a dozen giant , multicoloured orchids sent by well - wishers , she looks as busy as ever .
She clutches a handful of documents , eyeing them repeatedly between questions .
She is careful not to name names but leaves little doubt as to why she abandoned the government of Lula , a longtime friend and ally from Brazil 's Workers Party .
" I realised that I was no longer in a position to stabilise what had already been achieved and to carry on expanding these achievements , " she says baldly .
Seven days after resigning , she has still not seen the president , whom she has known for 30 years .
Silva 's resignation is the story of a conflict between two very different Brazils .
In one corner are the farmers , businessmen and ordinary Brazilians who see the country 's vast natural resources as a sure route to economic success .
In the other are the environmental activists , indigenous groups and concerned spectators who believe that Brazil 's march to economic greatness will mean the continued devastation of its rainforest and its peoples .
Silva attempted to tread a path between the two visions , trumpeting the idea of sustainable development .
This , she said , would provide better living conditions for the 25 million people in the Amazon region without obliterating the rainforest itself .
" There is no longer a way of thinking about growth for growth 's sake , " she argues .
" Growth is important , but it needs to be growth with development and sustainability , in all of its senses : social , environmental , economic , cultural . "
But walking this tightrope was never going to be simple , even for the notoriously resilient Silva , who frequently cites Nelson Mandela as one of her inspirations .
Maria Osmarina da Silva was born in 1958 in a community of rubber tappers called Seringal Bagaço , deep in the western state of Acre , not far from the border with Bolivia .
The nickname Marina stuck immediately .
One of 11 children ( three later died ) , she was orphaned at 16 and moved to the state capital Rio Branco .
Here she received a Catholic education and worked as a household maid to make ends meet .
Heavily influenced by liberation theology , she graduated in history from Acre 's Federal University at 26 and became increasingly politically active .
In 1984 she helped create Acre 's first workers ' union .
From an early age Silva was considered a guerreira , a battler , overcoming numerous episodes of tropical diseases such as malaria , and later mercury poisoning .
At 35 , she was elected as the youngest female senator in Brazil 's history .
She became a household name , famous for her shrill but powerful voice and unflinching defence of the Amazon .
She converted to evangelism and in 1994 became a missionary for the Pentecostal church God 's Assembly .
She also gained growing international exposure , winning a succession of awards for her environmental work .
When Lula da Silva was piecing together his first cabinet , her name was reportedly top of his list .
It was a crucial moment : between 2001 and 2002 , 26,000sq km ( 10,000 sq miles ) of rainforest had been lost .
Illegal logging was spiralling out of control .
A 40 - year assault , led by an unholy trinity of loggers , ranchers and , more recently , soy farmers , had destroyed an estimated 20 % of the Brazilian Amazon .
In August last year , however , the government celebrated a 30 % drop in rainforest destruction between 2006 and 2007 - the result , they said , of an ambitious plan launched in 2004 .
While many argued that the drop owed more to a fall in global commodity prices , the government was euphoric .
Silva , who was named as one of Brazil 's 15 most influential women by Forbes magazine in 2006 , hailed the news as " a great achievement for Brazilian society " .
But the faultlines between Silva and other sectors of the government were becoming increasingly clear , most strikingly in relation to an economic growth plan unveiled in early 2007 .
Designed to help propel Brazil towards the same level of economic growth as Russia , India and China , it proposed the construction of two massive hydroelectric dams in the Amazon .
Activists claim the dams , which were eventually given the green light , will displace thousands of people .
Silva resisted the plans .
Powerful backers of the scheme accused her of deliberately delaying environmental licences .
In January this year , the tensions grew , following the release of satellite images , produced by the government , which showed a sudden spike in deforestation .
Silva called a press conference , at which she blamed the destruction in part on soy farmers clearing more land for their crops .
Her comments are reported to have infuriated Lula .
Silva described the rise in deforestation as a " cancer " ; Lula rebutted that it was an " itch " , at most a " little tumour " .
It was becoming obvious that something had to give .
Last week , in a move widely seen as a snub to Silva , Lula placed Mangabeira Unger , known for his controversial ideas on development and industrialisation , in control of a new sustainable development scheme for the Amazon .
Simultaneously , several Amazonian politicians , among them Blairo Maggi , one of the world 's leading soy producers , mounted a lobby to overthrow measures that banned banks from loaning money to fund projects in areas of illegal deforestation .
" This was the last straw , " says Sergio Leitao of Greenpeace .
" How many times was she forced to back down ?
She did n't want to be responsible for this and so she said : ' Not on my watch . ' "
A week on from her resignation , however , Silva is upbeat about what her ministry achieved .
She talks of an environmental awakening in Brazil and around the world , " a new political pact with society that wants Brazil to develop but with the preservation of the Amazon , the Atlantic rainforest , the savannah and of all our water reserves " .
She is also adamant that this engagement has enabled a crackdown on the illegal loggers .
" Without the support of society it would have been impossible to have put 600 people involved in environmental crimes in the Amazon in jail , " she says .
" This is something that is achieved by a new social pact that is appearing inside and outside of the country . "
While supporters have described her exit from power as a defeat for the green cause , she insists that progress is being made .
" Twenty years ago there were politicians who promised chainsaws to their voters to win elections ...
Now we have a resolution that says neither public nor private banks can fund projects in an area that is being illegally deforested . "
Tomorrow , Silva will leave Brasilia and head home to Rio Branco for a short break .
As she gazes down from her plane at the sprawling Amazon jungle below , she will hope and pray that , with a number of giant infrastructure projects planned in the region , history is not about to repeat itself .
" Today we are living through the challenge of prevention , of looking twice before doing something , discussing twice before doing something .
Because each thing that we alter can lead to ... dramatic consequences .
Those who celebrated the industrial revolution never thought that we were injuring the planet , almost fatally .
We did n't have this knowledge .
Today we know " .
David Beckham NEW Armani Ads !
was on hand in San Francisco 's Union Square Wednesday to launch his latest ad campaign for .
A giant billboard was unveiled across from Macy's to the delight of throngs of screaming women .
33 - year - old Beckham was named the face and body of Armani underwear late last year , with the first ad campaign launching just in time for Christmas .
The racy ads leave very little to the imagination as Becks , affectionately nicknamed " Goldenballs " by wife Victoria Beckham , reveals more than just his washboard abs .
I do n't recall an ad campaign this sexy since Marky Mark Wahlberg 's Calvin Klein underwear ads in the 90s .
Now if you 'll excuse me I need to wipe the drool from my keyboard .

Many of us use the excellent OpenSSH ( see Related topics later in this article ) as a secure , encrypted replacement for the venerable telnet and rsh commands .
One of OpenSSH ’s more intriguing features is its ability to authenticate users using the RSA and DSA authentication protocols , which are based on a pair of complementary numerical keys .
As one of its main appeals , RSA and DSA authentication promise the capability of establishing connections to remote systems without supplying a password .
While this is appealing , new OpenSSH users often configure RSA / DSA the quick and dirty way , resulting in passwordless logins , but opening up a big security hole in the process .
What is RSA / DSA authentication ?
SSH , specifically OpenSSH ( a completely free implementation of SSH ) , is an incredible tool .
Like telnet or rsh , the ssh client can be used to log in to a remote machine .
All that ’s required is for this remote machine to be running sshd , the ssh server process .
However , unlike telnet , the ssh protocol is very secure .
It uses special algorithms to encrypt the data stream , ensure data stream integrity and even perform authentication in a safe and secure way .
However , while ssh is really great , there is a certain component of ssh functionality that is often ignored , dangerously misused , or simply misunderstood .
This component is OpenSSH ’s RSA / DSA key authentication system , an alternative to the standard secure password authentication system that OpenSSH uses by default .
OpenSSH ’s RSA and DSA authentication protocols are based on a pair of specially generated cryptographic keys , called the private key and the public key .
The advantage of using these key - based authentication systems is that in many cases , it ’s possible to establish secure connections without having to manually type in a password .
While the key - based authentication protocols are relatively secure , problems arise when users take certain shortcuts in the name of convenience , without fully understanding their security implications .
In this article , we ’ll take a good look at how to correctly use RSA and DSA authentication protocols without exposing ourselves to any unnecessary security risks .
In my next article , I ’ll show you how to use ssh - agent to cache decrypted private keys , and introduce keychain , an ssh - agent front - end that offers a number of convenience advantages without sacrificing security .
If you ’ve always wanted to get the hang of the more advanced authentication features of OpenSSH , then read on .
How RSA / DSA keys work
Here ’s a quick general overview of how RSA / DSA keys work .
Let ’s start with a hypothetical scenario where we ’d like to use RSA authentication to allow a local Linux workstation ( named localbox ) to open a remote shell on remotebox , a machine at our ISP .
Right now , when we try to connect to remotebox using the ssh client , we get the following prompt :
% ssh drobbins@remotebox drobbins@remotebox 's password : Show more Show more icon
Here we see an example of the ssh default way of handling authentication .
Namely , it asks for the password of the _drobbins account on remotebox .
If we type in our password for remotebox , ssh uses its secure password authentication protocol , transmitting our password over to remotebox for verification .
However , unlike what telnet does , here our password is encrypted so that it can not be intercepted by anyone sniffing our data connection .
Once remotebox authenticates our supplied password against its password database , if successful , we ’re allowed to log on and are greeted with a remotebox shell prompt .
While the ssh default authentication method is quite secure , RSA and DSA authentication open up some new possibilities .
However , unlike the ssh secure password authentication , RSA authentication requires some initial configuration .
We need to perform these initial configuration steps only once .
After that , RSA authentication between localbox and remotebox will be totally painless .
To set up RSA authentication , we first need to generate a pair of keys , one private and one public .
These two keys have some very interesting properties .
The public key can be used to encrypt a message , and only the holder of the private key can decrypt it .
The public key can only be used for encryption , and the private key can only be used for decryption of a message encoded by the matching public key .
The RSA ( and DSA ) authentication protocols use the special properties of key pairs to perform secure authentication , without needing to transmit any confidential information over the network .
To get RSA or DSA authentication working , we perform a single one - time configuration step .
We copy our public key over to remotebox .
The public key is called “ public ” for a reason .
Since it can only be used to encrypt messages for us , we do n’t need to be too concerned about it falling into the wrong hands .
Once our public key has been copied over to remotebox and placed in a special file ( ~/.ssh/authorizedkeys ) so that _remotebox ‘s sshd can locate it , we ’re ready to use RSA authentication to log onto remotebox .
To do this , we simply type ssh drobbins@remotebox at localbox ‘s console , as we always have .
However , this time , ssh lets remotebox ‘s sshd know that it would like to use the RSA authentication protocol .
What happens next is rather interesting .
Remotebox ‘s sshd generates a random number , and encrypts it using our public key that we copied over earlier .
Then , it sends this encrypted random number back to the ssh running on localbox .
In turn , our ssh uses our private key to decrypt this random number , and then sends it back to remotebox , saying in effect “ See , I really do hold the matching private key ; I was able to successfully decrypt your message ! ”
Finally , sshd concludes that we should be allowed to log in , since we hold a matching private key .
Thus , the fact that we hold a matching private key grants us access to remotebox .
Two observations
There are two important observations about the RSA and DSA authentication .
The first is that we really only need to generate one pair of keys .
We can then copy our public key to the remote machines that we ’d like to access and they will all happily authenticate against our single private key .
In other words , we do n’t need a key pair for every system we ’d like to access .
Just one pair will suffice .
The other observation is that our private key should not fall into the wrong hands .
The private key is the one thing that grants us access to our remote systems , and anyone that possesses our private key is granted exactly the same privileges that we are .
Just as we would n’t want strangers to have keys to our house , we should protect our private key from unauthorized use .
In the world of bits and bytes , this means that no one should be able to read or copy our private key .
Of course , the ssh developers are aware of the private keys ’ importance , and have built a few safeguards into ssh and ssh - keygen so that our private key is not abused .
First , ssh is configured to print out a big warning message if our key has file permissions that would allow it to be read by anyone but us .
Secondly , when we create our public / private key pair using ssh - keygen , ssh - keygen will ask us to enter a passphrase .
If we do , our private key will be encrypted using this passphrase , so that even if it is stolen , it will be useless to anyone who does n’t happen to know the passphrase .
Armed with that knowledge , let ’s take a look at how to configure ssh to use the RSA and DSA authentication protocols .
ssh - keygen up close
The first step in setting up RSA authentication begins with generating a public / private key pair .
RSA authentication is the original form of ssh key authentication , so RSA should work with any version of OpenSSH , although I recommend that you install the most recent version available , which was openssh - 2.9 _ p2 at the time this article was written .
Generate a pair of RSA keys as follows :
% ssh -keygen Generating public / private rs a1 key pair .
Enter file in which to save the key ( /home/ drobbins/.ssh/identity ) : ( hit enter ) Enter passphrase ( empty for no passphrase ) : ( enter a passphrase ) Enter same passphrase again : ( enter it again ) Your identification has been saved in /home / drobbins /.ssh/identity .
Your public key has been saved in /home / drobbins/.ssh/identity.pub .
The key fingerprint is : a4:e7 : f2:39:a7:eb:fd : f8:39:f1:f1:7b:fe:48:a1:09 drobbins@localbox
Show more
Show more icon
When ssh - keygen asks for a default location for the key , we hit enter to accept the default of /home / drobbins /.ssh/identity .
ssh - keygen will store the private key at the above path , and the public key will be stored right next to it , in a file called identity .
pub .
Also note that ssh - keygen prompted us to enter a passphrase .
When prompted , we entered a good passphrase ( seven or more hard - to - predict characters ) .
ssh - keygen then encrypted our private key ( ~/.ssh/identity ) using this passphrase so that our private key will be useless to anyone who does not know it .
The quick compromise
When we specify a passphrase , it allows ssh - keygen to secure our private key against misuse , but it also creates a minor inconvenience .
Now , every time we try to connect to our drobbins@remotebox account using ssh , ssh will prompt us to enter the passphrase so that it can decrypt our private key and use it for RSA authentication .
Again , we wo n’t be typing in our password for the drobbins account on remotebox , we ’ll be typing in the passphrase needed to locally decrypt our private key .
Once our private key is decrypted , our ssh client will take care of the rest .
While the mechanics of using our remote password and the RSA passphrase are completely different , in practice we ’re still prompted to type a “ secret phrase ” into ssh .
# ssh drobbins@remotebox Enter passphrase for key ' /home/drobbins/.ssh/identity ' : ( enter passphrase ) Last login : Thu Jun 28 20:28:47 2001 from localbox.gentoo.org
Welcome to remotebox ! %

Here ’s where people are often mislead into a quick compromise .
A lot of the time , people will create unencrypted private keys just so that they do n’t need to type in a password .
That way , they simply type in the ssh command , and they ’re immediately authenticated via RSA ( or DSA ) and logged in .
# ssh drobbins@remotebox Last login : Thu Jun 28 20:28:47 2001 from localbox.gentoo.org
Welcome to remotebox ! %

However , while this is convenient , you should n’t use this approach without fully understanding its security impact .
With an unencrypted private key , if anyone ever hacks into localbox , they ’ll also get automatic access to remotebox and any other systems that have been configured with the public key .
I know what you ’re thinking .
Passwordless authentication , despite being a bit risky does seem really appealing .
I totally agree .
But there is a better way !
Stick with me , and I ’ll show you how to gain the benefits of passwordless authentication without compromising your private key security .
I ’ll show you how to masterfully use ssh- agent ( the thing that makes secure passwordless authentication possible in the first place ) in my next article .
Now , let ’s get ready to use ssh - agent by setting up RSA and DSA authentication .
Here step - by - step directions .
RSA key pair generation
To set up RSA authentication , we ’ll need to perform the one - time step of generating a public / private key pair .
We do this by typing :
% ssh-keygen Show more Show more icon
Accept the default key location when prompted ( typically ~/.ssh/identity and ~/.ssh/identity .pub for the public key ) , and provide ssh - keygen with a secure passphrase .
Once ssh - keygen completes , you ’ll have a public key as well as a passphrase - encrypted private key .
RSA public key install
Next , we ’ll need to configure remote systems running sshd to use our public RSA key for authentication .
Typically , this is done by copying the public key to the remote system as follows :
% scp ~/.ssh/identity.pub drobbins@remotebox : Show more
Show more icon
Since RSA authentication is n’t fully set up yet , we ’ll be prompted to enter our password on remotebox .
Do so .
Then , log in to remotebox and append the public key to the ~/.ssh / authorized_keys file like so :
% ssh drobbins@remotebox drobbins@remotebox 's password : ( enter password ) Last login : Thu Jun 28 20:28:47 2001 from localbox.gentoo.org
Welcome to remotebox ! % cat identity.pub >>
~/.ssh/authorized_keys % exit Show more
Show more icon
Now , with RSA authentication configured , we should be prompted to enter our RSA passphrase ( rather than our password ) when we try to connect to remotebox using ssh .
% ssh drobbins@remotebox Enter passphrase for key ' /home/drobbins/.ssh/identity ' :
Show more
Show more icon
Hurray , RSA authentication configuration complete !
If you were n’t prompted for a passphrase , here are a few things to try .
First , try logging in by typing ssh - 1 drobbins@remotebox .
This will tell ssh to only use version 1 of the ssh protocol , and may be required if for some reason the remote system is defaulting to DSA authentication .
If that does n’t work , make sure that you do n’t have a line that reads RSAAuthentication no in your / etc / ssh / sshconfig .
If you do , comment it out by pre-pending it with a “ # ” .
Otherwise , try contacting the _remotebox system administrator and verifying that they have enabled RSA authentication on their end and have the appropriate settings in /etc / ssh / sshd_config .
DSA key generation
While RSA keys are used by version 1 of the ssh protocol , DSA keys are used for protocol level 2 , an updated version of the ssh protocol .
Any modern version of OpenSSH should be able to use both RSA and DSA keys .
Generating DSA keys using OpenSSH ’s ssh - keygen can be done similarly to RSA in the following manner :
% ssh - keygen -t dsa Show more Show more icon
Again , we ’ll be prompted for a passphrase .
Enter a secure one .
We ’ll also be prompted for a location to save our DSA keys .
The default , normally ~/.ssh/id_dsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub , should be fine .
After our one - time DSA key generation is complete , it ’s time to install our DSA public key to remote systems .
DSA public key install
Again , DSA public key installation is almost identical to RSA .
For DSA , we ’ll want to copy our ~/.ssh/iddsa.pub file to _remotebox , and then append it to the ~/.ssh / authorizedkeys2 on _remotebox .
Note that this file has a different name than the RSA authorizedkeys file .
Once configured , we should be able to log in to _remotebox by typing in our DSA private key passphrase rather than typing in our actual remotebox password .

HYDERABAD , India -- Mohammed Usman used to cram as many people as possible into his motorized rickshaw -- up to eight adults , twice the legal limit .

" If I put more than one extra person , I know I 'll get a ticket , " he says .
" The risk is too high . "
Tiny , tinny three - wheel taxis , known as autorickshaws , are ubiquitous in South Asia .
They are nimble , cheap and popular : A ride costs just pennies .
But they are also dangerous , and as Indian roads get increasingly crowded , passengers are paying with their lives .
Here in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh , autorickshaws are involved in one - third of all accidents , even though they account for only one out of every 20 vehicles on the road .
So the cops are cracking down .
Police are enforcing long - ignored laws against overcrowding , and officials are rounding up drivers for training sessions .
Drivers must sit through an educational video and view gory photos -- autorickshaws crushed between buses , and mangled on roadsides -- to qualify for a free lunch .
PETER ’S NEW YORK , April 14 , 2008 -- Ralph Nader , the consumer activist and independent presidential candidate , seems to think that the report of the commission assigned to investigate the events of 9 - 11 should not be the last word .
" There are unanswered questions in the 9 - 11 investigation , and they should be answered , " Nader said at a recent address at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia .
" How do you go from plausibility to evidence ?
You have a more independent inquiry . "
On the morning of September 11 , 2001 , airliners collided with each of the twin towers of New York City ’s World Trade Center , after which they and a third nearby office building mysteriously collapsed .
Other incidents on the same day at the Pentagon and in a field in Pennsylvania were also attributed to aircraft collisions .
All were pitched by the government as the result of a terrorist conspiracy , although it is widely believed that the government may have played a direct role in orchestrating the events .
After public cries for an investigation , President George Bush and Congress deputized the 9 - 11 Commission , which issued its report in 2004 .
While the report was praised by some , critics contended that it was not much more than a government whitewash .
On another topic , Nader had kind words to say for presidential candidate , Ron Paul .
" Ron Paul is very good on foreign policy , " he said .
" He 's a refreshing voice . "
Nader also praised Paul for his outspoken opposition to the aggressive U.S. stance against Iran and the so - called “ war - on - drugs . ”
Paul is vying with John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination .
Nader ’s remarks were made on April 4 , and aired on C - SPAN today .

Reid , Pelosi , Dean may intervene in nomination
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) said Thursday that he may have to push undecided superdelegates to make their decisions in the Democratic presidential race , if the contest stretches into June .
Reid said he would consider writing a joint letter with Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) demanding that superdelegates make their endorsements public .
“ The three of us , we may write a joint letter [ to superdelegates ] , ” said Reid .
“ We might do individual letters .
We are in contact with each other . ”
Reid 's comments suggest that the party ’s top three officials are contemplating a high - level intervention if the primary season concludes in June without a nominee and many superdelegates still undecided .
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) 's 9 - point victory over Sen. Barack Obama ( D - ill . ) in Tuesday 's Pennsylvania Democratic primary means that the contentious nomination fight will likely continue into the summer .
As the race continues to tighten , the decisions of the undecided superdelegates could determine the final outcome .
Both Dean and Reid have made no secret of their desire to see the nomination fight end by the end of June .
However , Reid aides warned people not to read too much into his newest comments .
" Sen . Reid was talking about the possibility of simply sending a letter to superdelegates after the primary process is over to encourage them to make their support known , " said Rodell Mollineau , Reid 's communications director .
" His statement today was nothing more than a reiteration of his past comments that most superdelegates should be in a position after June 3rd to make a decision and make their support known .
No one should read any further into it than that . "
Stacie Paxton , a spokeswoman for the DNC , declined to discuss any potential letter to superdelegates .
" I will just reiterate that Dean has said for some time now that he is encouraging the unpledged delegates to make their intentions known by July 1 so this does n't go to the convention , " Paxton said .
Reid , who himself has not endorsed , said he would not rush any of the superdelegates for now .
" People will have plenty of opportunity after the last primary on June 2 to make a decision about what they are going to do , " he said .
However , when asked by a reporter if he would be forced to weigh in on the race , Reid replied , " I might have to . "
The Senate majority leader also hinted that another high - profile superdelegate could be making an endorsement in the coming days .
Reid said he met Wednesday with all of the Senate committee chairman , and that one chairman told him he was going to make an endorsement decision " soon . "
When asked in the hallway if he was the committee chairman in question , Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden ( D - Del. ) delivered an emphatic " no . "
UPDATE : Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly said Pelosi has no " specific plans for a letter " to superdelegates .
" She is not opposed to the idea [ of a letter ] but does not have any plans to do so , ” said Daly .
Like Dean and Reid , Pelosi has expressed her desire to see the nomination wrapped up before July .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
A Missouri mom was indicted Thursday for her alleged role in the death of a teen who killed herself over a failed Internet romance that turned out to be a hoax .
Megan Meier , 13 , hanged herself in her bedroom after being targeted in a MySpace hoax .
A federal indictment accuses Lori Drew , 49 , of O'Fallon , Missouri , of using the social networking Web site MySpace.com to pose as a 16 - year - old boy and feign romantic interest in the girl .
The girl , Megan Meier , committed suicide after her online love interest spurned her , according to prosecutors , telling her the world would be a better place without her .
Drew faces up to 20 years in prison on charges of conspiracy and accessing protected computers to obtain information to inflict emotional distress .
The indictment , which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , accuses Drew and others of registering on MySpace as " Josh Evans " and using the account to lure Meier into an an online romance .
Authorities have previously said that Drew set up the account to find out what Meier , who lived in her neighborhood , was saying about her daughter .
Prosecutors allege that Drew and the others violated MySpace 's terms of service by using false information to create the account so they could " harass , abuse or harm " Meier , according to the indictment .
The two corresponded for about four weeks before " Josh " broke off the relationship , authorities said .
Within an hour , Meier hanged herself in her room and died the next day .
The indictment does not allege that Drew sent the final message telling Meier the world would be a better place without her .
Instead , it blames her unnamed co-conspirators , who authorities have previously said include a teenage girl .
After Drew learned of the teen 's suicide , the indictment alleges , she directed one of the teens involved to " keep her mouth shut " and deleted the account .
Meier 's mother , Tina Meier , told CNN in November that her daughter had self - esteem issues and had struggled with depression since childhood .
She said when her daughter began receiving messages from " Josh " telling her she was pretty , she was thrilled .
When " Josh " broke off the relationship , Tina Meier said , her daughter was devastated .
" She was looking for me to help calm herself down like I always did and be there for her .
And I was upset because I did n't like the language she was using , and I was angry she did n't sign off when I told her to , " Tina Meier told CNN .
Watch Tina Meier 's reaction to the charges »
" She said to me , ' You 're supposed to be my mom , you 're supposed to be on my side , ' and then took off running upstairs , " Tina Meier said .
Tina Meier found her daughter hanging by a belt shortly afterward .
" It 's as if my daughter killed herself with a gun , " Meier 's father , Ron , told CNN .
" And it 's as if they loaded the gun for her . "
Drew is scheduled for arraignment in June .
" This adult woman allegedly used the Internet to target a young teenage girl , with horrendous ramifications , " U.S. Attorney Thomas P. O'Brien said in a written statement .
" Any adult who uses the Internet or a social gathering Web site to bully or harass another person , particularly a young teenage girl , needs to realize that their actions can have serious consequences , " O'Brien said .
In December , Missouri prosecutors declined to file charges against Drew , saying there was no law under which she could be charged .
" There is no way that anybody could know that talking to someone or saying that you 're mean to your friends on the Internet would create a substantial risk , " St. Charles County Prosecutor Jack Banas said .
" Under the law , we just could n't show that . "

Once the days of color movies were well established , a few directors returned to black and white – either for effect , or sometimes even cost .
This list is a summary of the best work produced in black and white in modern times .
By modern I mean movies that were made using black and white for effect even though color was the most common film format .
Films that use splashes of color are allowed , but films which use a lot of full frame color are not ( this excludes Pleasantville and American History X ) .
Many thanks to Blogball for suggesting this topic in the forums .
NOTE : This list includes only one film per director – for that reason you may find one or two you love missing .

By Law is an independent film which tells the story of the arrest , incarceration , and escape of three men from prison .
Slow moving camera work captures the environment in which they find themselves ( New Orleans and the Bayous ) beautifully .
The film focuses on the inter- relationships between the men , as opposed to the standard jail type films which tend to focus on the mechanics of the escape .
A nice bonus for this movie is that it stars singer - songwriter Tom Waits .

13 The Man Who Was n’t There 2001 , Joel and Ethan Coen
This is probably one of the Cohen Brother ’s lesser known films , but it is certainly not one that should be neglected .
The film tells the story of a man trying to escape from his humdrum life and it stars Billy Bob Thornton , Scarlett Johansson , and Frances McDormand .
The film was actually shot on color film but was released ( as intended ) in black and white – to give more authenticity to its setting – the 1950s .
When it was released , a couple of reels were accidentally released in color .

12 Pi 1998 , Darren Aronofsky
This film ( directed by the director of Requiem for a Dream ) is about a Mathematical Genius .
Due to his genius with numbers , he is pursued by Wall Street companies who want him to work form for financial gains .
Add to the mix some strange theories on numbers in the Torah and you have a fascinating , and bizarre movie .
The movie was made on a low budget and was filmed on black and white reversal film ( a film type that gives you a positive image on the original without having to go through the negative process ) .

11 Clerks 1994 , Kevin Smith
This movie describes a day in the life of two clerks in New jersey .
It covers their various mishaps and misdemeanors , which include drug dealers , a wake , a dead customer , and a lot of abuse of customers .
The film was shot entirely in black and white and was financed entirely by the director ( who sold his comic book collection and maxed out a bunch of credit cards to raise the funds ) .
In total it cost $ 27,575 to make , and has since made over 3.1 million US dollars .

10 Night of the Living Dead 1968 , George Romero
This indie film was produced on a budget of $ 114,000 US dollars and has made over 40 million worldwide .
The film had a great influence of Vietnam - era USA because of its subtle critiques of society .
The special effects were all done on the cheap – for example , all of the blood was Bosco chocolate syrup , and mortician ’s wax was used to create the zombie effects .
The black and white guerilla style filming has been described as giving the unflinching authority of a wartime newsreel .

9 La Haine 1995 , Mathieu Kassovitz
La Haine is a brilliant film about three young men in Paris – an Arab , a Jew , and a Black .
The three friends are struggling during times of racial unrest and the film centers around the consequences of a policeman shooting an arab during race riots .
I have to confess that this is my all time favorite French film , so be sure to watch it .
The black and white film adds to the feeling of authenticity in the riot scenes and might even be considered to be a commentary on the racial aspects of the film ( ie , no color signifies the hope that we will live in a world free of color discrimination ) .

8 Ed Wood 1994 , Tim Burton
Ed Wood is a cult movie based on the life of the cross - dressing film director the same name .
When Tim Burton announced that he wanted to film entirely in black and white , Columbia Pictures refused – saying that it would make the film impossible to sell in foreign markets and on video .
Burton refused to change his mind and eventually ended up making the film for Disney where he had complete control .
The film only made 5.8 million dollars , but it was highly acclaimed by critics .

7 Young Frankenstein 1974 , Mel Brooks
Young Frankenstein is a comedy starring Gene Wilder .
The film parodies Mary Shelley ’s Frankenstein – in fact , many of the props were the same as those used in the 1930 film of the same tale .
To further enhance the atmosphere of the film , Brooks decided to film it entirely in black and white – an unusual choice for its time .
The film also used 1930s style scene transitions such as fades to black , wipes and iris outs .

6 Manhattan 1979 , Woody Allen
Manhattan is a comedy directed by and starring Woody Allen .
The film won the BAFTA award for best film .
Woody Allen decided to film in black and white because that was how he remembered Manhattan from his childhood – through picture postcards and books .
Allen said : “ In Manhattan I really think that we succeeded in showing the city .
When you see it there on that big screen it ’s really decadent . ”
When the movie was released to video , Allen demanded that it be released in the same aspect ratio as the big screen – highly unusual at the time .

5 Sin City 2005 , Frank Miller , Robert Rodriguez
The film Sin City was based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller .
This film is one of the few fully digital , live - action motion pictures .
This technique also means that the whole film was initially shot in full color , and was converted back to high - quality black - and - white .
Colorization was added later to each scene and the whole thing was treated for heightened contrast to give more separation to the blacks and whites ( as is often seen in the film noir tradition ) .

4 The Elephant Man 1980 , David Lynch
The Elephant Man is a biopic based loosely around the life of Joseph Merrick ( a sufferer of Proteus Syndrome – not elephantiasis as is commonly thought ) .
The film was a surprise hit and received eight academy award nominations .
The black and white film style gives an authentically historical feeling to this film which is set in the Victorian era .
The film was produced by Mel Brooks , who played down his involvement so as to not have people think it might be a comedy .

3 Dr Strangelove 1964 , Stanley Kubrick
“ Dr. Strangelove or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb ” is a film based on the cold war thriller book Red Alert by Peter George .
The film satirizes the doctrine of mutual assured destruction .
The film is made entirely in Black and White which some say helps to put an unadorned face on the issues being dealt with .
This is , beyond a doubt , one of Kubrick ’s greatest movies .

2 Schindler ’s List 1993 , Steven Spielberg
Schindler ’s List is based on the life of Oskar Schindler – a German businessman who saved the life of over 1,000 Jews during the second world war .
The decision to film in black and white was made to give a timeless feel to the film and it was based on German Expressionism and Italian neorealism .
The black and white filming caused difficulties for the set designers who were used to working in color ; they had to darken the sets and costumes in order to prevent the actors from blending in .
The color red was added to one girl ’s coat in order to symbolize the blood on the hands of the allied forces who did nothing to help the Jews at the time .

1 Raging Bull 1980 , Martin Scorsese
Raging Bull is based on the life story of temperamental boxer Jake LaMotta ( played by Robert De Niro ) .
Initially the film received mixed reactions , but it is now considered to be one of the greatest films ever made – along with Taxi Driver – also starring De Niro and directed by Scorsese .
Scorsese and the cinematographer ( Michael Chapman ) decided to film entirely in black and white in order to add period authenticity – the film was set in the 1940s and both men remembered boxing from the period in black and white photographs .
The final decision to go black and white was made to help differentiate the film from other boxing movies being released around the same time ( such as Rocky ) .

One would think with series four of Doctor Who starting on Saturday that this would have been the most opportune time to promote the project .
It ’s fresh one the publics ’ mind .
Dammit Eidos , use that to your advantage !
No one ’s asking for the finished product ( yet ) .
We just want to know something .
Who knows ( No pun intended . ) , maybe they ’re waiting for the two year gap between series four and five to tell us something .
Speaking of Doctor Who , I ’m part of a new Doctor Who News Blog that launched earlier this month ( What a coincidence that this comic is about Doctor Who as well ?
Odd … )
It ’s called The Who - Philes and it ’s full of news and information that both new and seasoned Doctor Who fans , or who - philes as we call them , can appreciate .

No one forgets their first love .
Nor , hard as they try , can they forget the stupid things they did trying to impress them .
Like coming to class in a pair of ultra - wide JNCOs from Pacific Sunwear on Friday Jeans Day when Erica Lapchak knew damn well you 'd never wore anything but elastic waistband khakis since the first grade .
But foolish as we may make ourselves , the fact remains that the dance of courtship requires leaps of faith and flexibility .
No prize worth winning is ever won without stepping up your A game , and no relationships leave us unchanged , but remember who you were , because it 's still who you are .
This week 's haiku go out to all who 've ever made their play , whether it panned out or not .

Update 3 : Please see my follow - up post about Twitter 's response .
I started using Twitter in March 2007 , just before their SXSW explosion .
Not surprisingly , I instantly became addicted and since then have used the service for everything from personal to professional .
Overall , Twitter is a great platform to connect with friends and co-workers and it felt safe in an " everyone knows everyone " sort of way in the beginning .
However , as with any social network that continues to grow ( especially one that focuses on broadcasting messages to the masses ) , it opens itself up to the prospect of abuse , harassment , spam , and other types of typical Terms of Service violations .
Considering the social network - sphere as it exists today , most people would assume that Twitter would be prepared to react and take action against TOS violations - their TOS page even states
" ( These terms of service were inspired , with permission , by Flickr . ) " -
Flickr being well - known for taking action on TOS violations , even when the violations are debatable .
As I found out last month , the reality of Twitter is that they refuse to warn and / or ban people who use their service to " abuse , harass , threaten , impersonate or intimidate other Twitter users " ( to quote their fourth line item on their TOS page ) .
What does this mean ?
In short , anyone can use Twitter to consistently harass you and ruin search results for your identity and Twitter wo n't execute any means of community management .
In June 2007 , I unfortunately found myself on the receiving end of multiple accounts of harassment from a user on Twitter .
When the user started using my full name in their harassing tweets , I reported the harassment as a form of cyberbullying to Twitter 's community manager and received a response that let me know they cared about the situation :
" [ We ] have decided , as a preemptive measure , to remove [ the user 's ] updates from the public timeline .
...
If you have anymore problems with [ this user ] , please let us know right away , we 're here to help : ) "
The harassment continued throughout the course of 2007 .
Since Twitter and I had an open dialog started , I would periodically report cases of continuing harassment ( some of which spread between Flickr and Twitter ) .
Twitter would take no action while Flickr would immediately ban and remove all traces of the harassment .
Unfortunately , in 2008 it escalated to a level that could no longer be ignored .
Tweets were being fired off directly calling me a " cunt " amongst other harassing language .
On March 14 , I wrote to Twitter , giving the example URLs of abuse and stated to them clearly :
" Since this is an ongoing case and due to the nature of the content , I think this person is clearly violating Twitter 's TOS and I find it necessary for Twitter to uphold to this : " 4 .
You must not abuse , harass , threaten , impersonate or intimidate other Twitter users . "
Honestly , I believe this harassment has gotten way out of hand for too long .
I am writing to you and to Twitter to remove this user for consistent long - term harassment . "
Twitter responded after 3 days :
" Unfortunately , although [ this user 's ] behavior is admittedly mean , [ s / he ] is n't necessarily doing anything against our terms of service .
I 've been following [ their ] profile since your first complaint to monitor [ them ] , as well .
We can't remove [ this user 's ] profile or ban [ this user 's ]
IP address ; [ they 're ] not doing anything illegal . "
To which I replied ( at which point , Jack , Twitter 's CEO was copied ) :
" I do n't believe this is a case of illegal activity - this is a clear case of harassment which is outlined in your TOS .
To be blunt , I find that someone using your service to call me a " cunt " in a public forum is defined as harassment .
Again , your TOS states : " 4 . You must not abuse , harass , threaten , impersonate or intimidate other Twitter users .
"
It 's Twitter 's responsibility to uphold the TOS , otherwise the TOS has no meaning . "
At this point , Jack responded requesting a phone discussion about the issue .
My notes from the phone call on March 19 :
I told Jack that it the harassment has escalated and that it was a very clear violation of their TOS and that I had had similar cases of harassment on Flickr in which Flickr took down all 3 of the harassing accounts .
I asked Jack if Twitter had ever dealt with stalkers or banning people before and he told me they never had .
Jack explained that they 're scared to ban someone because they 're scared if it turned into a lawsuit that they are too small of a company to handle it .
Jack additionally explained that their TOS was up for interpretation , to which I responded that it is n't .
I explained that it clearly states " You must not harass other Twitter users " and that harassment is defined as continuous small attacks , which this is .
Jack then asked me about what other social networks had done .
I said that Flickr deleted all the profiles and that services like Digg and Pownce do n't think twice about banning abusive or harassing users because it 's part of the TOS .
( Note : Flickr is known for asking users to take down content and / or banning accounts that might even very loosely be * considered * as harassment , which , again , I find interesting , considering at the end of Twitter 's TOS , it states : " ( These terms of service were inspired , with permission , by Flickr . ) " ) .
Jack asked me what good it would do to ban my stalker since it seemed obvious that the stalker would continue to stalk me elsewhere .
I told him that it was not his nor Twitter 's responsibility nor business to stop my stalker , but that it was very much their responsibility to identify users violating their TOS on their own service and take action accordingly .
At the end of the conversation , Jack asked me " well , what would be a happy resolution for you ? " .
I responded saying that seeing the user who is consistently harassing me banned .
I told him that I totally support Twitter and want to see them do well and was trying to understand their fear of getting sued , so I said that at the " EXTREMELY least " that Twitter needed to send the user harassing me a warning , that Twitter did n't owe the user any information other than the fact that they had been reported as violating their TOS and to cease or be banned .
I very much stressed that Twitter needs to send users violating TOS a warning at the very least if they do n't ban .
Jack then said he would need to talk to their lawyers about that and would get back to me by the end of the next week .
Jack did n't get back to me until I emailed him on April 9 with 8 new instances of abuse that included my full name and email address , attached to words like " crack - whore " and " lesbian porn " , to which he emailed me back a response :
" Ariel ,
Apologies for the delay here .
We 've reviewed the matter and decided it 's not in our best interest to get involved .
We 've tasked our lawyers with a full review and update of our TOS .
Thank you for your patience and understanding and good luck with resolving the problem .
Best ,
Jack . "
Thanks ,
Twitter .
It 's great to know that your Terms of Service that you force everyone to agree to do n't mean anything .
Update : I 've also started a topic on Get Satisfaction about the issue that also outlines how Twitter 's excuse of being sued holds no ground under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act .
Update 2 : This is already disclosed in the about section of this blog already , but I am stating it again here at the request of others : I am the community manager for Pownce , however , this issue started before I was working at Pownce .
The opinions stated here do not reflect my clients / employers and I did * not* write this in the interest of them .
It is well known that I am not a Twitter - hater ( much the opposite ) .
Air - powered scooter leaves city centres cleaner
Previous Slide ◀ Next Slide ▶ Jem Stansfield with his air - powered Puch moped 1 of 1
An inventor has created what he claims is the world ’s first motorcycle powered by fresh air .
Jem Stansfield says his converted Puch moped produces cleaner air than found in many town and city centres and so can actually reduce pollution .
“ It actually fires out cleaner air , ” said 37 - year - old Stansfield , who used to be a sheep herder .
The University of Bristol aeronautics graduate fitted the Puch with high pressure carbon fibre air cylinders used by fire fighters as breathing apparatus in burning buildings .
The cylinders power two rotary air engines which in turn drive the chain to the rear wheel .
Unlike electric scooters , it takes just seconds to recharge from larger air tanks filled by a diving compressor .
With a top speed of 18 mph and a range of just seven miles between air top-ups , Stansfield admits it ’s never going to be good for trans - continental touring .
But hesaid : “ You could definitely run a fleet of delivery bikes on it . ”
TV presenter Stansfield built the scooter for a National Geographic channel documentary , Planet Mechanics .
Viewers can see him test ride it in Bristol when the programme is aired on June 3 at 6 pm .
Read the latest stories causing a buzz this week in News …
The Pentagon says it has to shoot down a malfunctioning spy satellite because of the threat of a toxic gas cloud .
Space security experts are calling the rationale highly unlikely .
" Having the US government spend millions of dollars to destroy a billion - dollar failure to save zero lives is comedic gold , " one tells DANGER ROOM .
Yesterday , Deputy National Security Advisor James Jeffrey said the satellite 's tank full of hydrazine rocket propellant was the main reason the military was planning to blast the orbiter .
There 's a small but real risk that the hydrazine tank could rupture , releasing a " toxic gas " over a " populated area , " causing a " risk to human life . "
But , as we noted yesterday , Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman Gen .
James Cartwright cast the threat from the satellite in much less dire terms .
Even if the hydrazine were released , he noted , the effects would likely be mild – akin to chlorine gas poisoning , which can cause burning in the lungs , and elsewhere .
The area affected would be " roughly the size of two football fields [ where you might ] incur something that would make you go to the doctor . "
And that does n't sound like much of a risk at all .
Especially when you consider that several other hydrazine - filled object have come crashing down to Earth .
Not only did the space shuttle Columbia have a similar tank , which survived re-entry , with no toxic gas cloud .
Several other hydrazine - laced objects have also crashed into the atmosphere , with no ill effects .
Space researcher Ed
Kyle notes that there were 42 major reentry objects for 2007 , including 9
satellites – at least one of which contained a form of hydrazine , UMDH ( unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine ) .
In addition , roughly 8 - 12 upper stages that originally contained UDMH
reentered during 2007 .
Some of these could very well have contained some residual propellant .
[ One particular ] upper stage probably contained several hundred [ kilgograms ] of residual propellant , for example .*
Which leads one military satellite observer to tell DANGER ROOM , " Everything they said made sense except for the reason for doing the intercept in the first place . "
" The hydrazine tank is a 1 - meter sphere containing about 400 liters of hydrazine .
The stated hazard area is about 2 hectares , something like
1/10,000,000,000 of the area under the orbit , " he adds .
The potential for actual harm in unbelievably small .
Which means the hydrazine rationale just does n't hold up , literally not within orders of magnitude . "
" The cynic in me says that the idea that this is being done to protect the lives of humans is simply a feel - good cover story tossed to the media , " another veteran space security specialist adds .
" It is true that hydrazine is very toxic and could result injury or death , but the odds of this happening are minuscule .
The average person in American is many thousands of times more likely to be killed in a car accident than by any falling debris .
In fact , no one has ever been killed by space debris ( I have heard of one or two being struck but only minor injuries ) .
So pretty much everything else you can think of ( including getting hit by an asteroid / comet ) is many times more likely than dying from this .
Having the US government spend millions of dollars to destroy a billion - dollar failure to save zero lives is comedic gold . "
" There has to be another reason behind this , " said Michael Krepon , co-founder of the Henry L. Stimson
Center , tells the Washington Post .
" In the history of the space age , there has not been a single human being who has been harmed by man-made objects falling from space . "
So what could that other reason be ?
Our veteran space security specialist believes there are several .
To him , the satellite shot is a chance for the military to try out its missile defense capabilities ; a way to keep secret material out of the wrong hands ; and a warning to the Chinese , after they destroyed a satellite about a year ago .
He shared some educated guesses :
My first thought is that MDA [ Missile Defense Agency ] is always looking for ways to pimp their systems and provide further justification that they work .
The upcoming change in Administration is almost guaranteed to result in missile defense losing the top - level advocacy that it has enjoyed for the last several years .
Any additional missions and justifications that the missile defense community can provide would increase the likelihood of their systems ( and budgetary power ) surviving .
An additional reason could be that destroying the satellite would prevent any chance of another nation getting access to any of the potentially sensitive technology on board .
However , I have heard from other sources that supposedly the NRO [ National Reconnaissance Office - the country 's spy satellite shop ] is actually against the
" shootdown " ( and I hate that term - the satellite is not flying and is coming down regardless of whether or not it gets hit by a missile ) .
Their absence at the press briefing could lend some weight to this rumor , although it could also be explained by the nature of the satellite and its still classified link to the NRO .
My real concern is that this is simply a knee - jerk reaction made by the Administration in response to the purported threat by the Chinese .
Since the April 2007 ASAT [ anti- satellite ] test , there have been rumors and whispers going around that the Administration and like - minded individuals are looking for more sticks ( instead of carrots ) to use against China .
While this " shoot down " is not a direct action against China , it would be a clear signal that the US can possess an active ASAT capability at any time if it so desires .
That is a serious development as the previous US ASAT system using F - 15s was mothballed in the 1980's .
There are many significant political ramifications that would happen as a result of this .
The US has been berating the Chinese on their ASAT test but now demonstrate that it is okay as long as it occurs at a low enough altitude to prevent long - lasting debris and can
" save lives " .
This is close to an implied " ok " for the US and other nations to conduct more ASAT tests , which could open another arms race .
I am also certain that Russian and China would also see this as a slap in the face as they are trying to revive the Peaceful Uses of
Outer Space treaty discussion and ban on space weapons .
It would further negatively affect the relations between them and the US .
Which could lead to increased tensions , arms buildup , etc etc etc .
Nothing good for anyone outside of arms manufacturers and politicians that need a bogeyman to scare people into voting for them .
Oh , and [ NASA Adminsitrator Mike ]
Griffin 's presence at the briefing was also an indicator to me that they are trying to spin this as a safety issue and not a missile defense / ASAT test .
NASA has absolutely nothing to do with
US Strategic Command using a Navy missile to blow up a broken NRO satellite .
This is a military / national security op from the start and the only reason you trot the NASA Administrator out is to try and convince people otherwise .
UPDATE : Regardless of the central rationale for the anticipated intercept of a dying satellite , the action almost certainly would offer the Pentagon useful data on conducting antisatellite missions , our own Jeffrey Lewis tells Global Security Newswire .
* The dead U.S. satellite is to be struck at a significantly lower altitude than other space assets .
However , that could prove even more of a challenge to the Navy than any future antisatellite operation because spacecraft on lower orbits typically travel at higher speeds ,
Lewis said .
*
The upcoming shot — using a sea - based Standard Missile 3 developed for regional and tactical missile defense — could thus prove to be a useful test for less demanding intercepts that might someday follow , he said .
“ The higher a satellite is [ in space ] , the slower it moves , more or less , ” Lewis said .
“ This is a perfectly good ASAT test . ” ... Asked if it would be fair for other nations to regard the Standard
Missile 3 as an antisatellite - capable weapon if the upcoming mission is successful , Cartwright said it was “ a fair question and a good question . ”
However , he said , the Navy has implemented for this action a
“ one - time ” modification to the three ships and missiles , which “ would not be transferable to a fleet configuration . ”
For their part , “ the Chinese are going to use this to excuse their otherwise inexcusable test , ” Lewis said .
“ And those other countries who we count on to create a norm against debris - creating ASATs will be less willing to help us ” in that effort , he said .
That said , Lewis added , “ maybe they ’ll buy the hydrazine story . ”

Over 500 juveniles held by US in Iraq and Afghanistan
By Joe Kay
20 May 2008
United States occupying forces are holding about 500 juvenile prisoners in Iraq , and an additional 10 in Afghanistan , according to a document submitted by the US to the United Nations .
The document , sent to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child , was released publicly last week .
A juvenile is defined as an individual under the age of 18 .
Since 2002 , the US says it has detained for some duration of time 2,500 juveniles , most of them in the massive prison complexes constructed by the US military in Iraq .
The heavy arrest of juveniles in Iraq underscores the fact that US operations are directed at the population as a whole and often involve widespread and indiscriminate arrests .
The US also admits to having detained eight juveniles at Guantánamo Bay , though it claims that it no longer holds anyone there under 18 .
At least two individuals who were under 18 at the time of their arrest are still held at Guantánamo Bay , and face military commissions .
Other agencies have estimated significantly higher numbers of juveniles held at Guantánamo .
The number of juvenile prisoners increased sharply last year , corresponding to the so - called “ surge ” in Iraq .
According to the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , the number of juveniles held in Iraq increased from 200 in September 2005 , to 250 in May 2007 , and to 800 in September 2007 .
Arrests of children in Iraq rose to an average of 100 per month in 2007 , up from 25 per month in 2006 .
A report in Agence France - Press in December 2007 reported a figure of 950 children held at one prison complex at Camp Cropper , near Baghdad .
The figures have appeared to have dropped somewhat since then , at least officially .
The US military of course claims that all those behind bars had engaged in “ anti-coalition activities . ”
There is no way to verify these claims or to determine how long the young prisoners are kept in jail .
The US report to the UN declared that the average length of imprisonment for juveniles was under 12 months .
To the extent that those under 18 are actually involved in resistance activities — as opposed to simply being picked up for being in the wrong place at the wrong time — it is a reflection of the deep hostility to the US occupation that pervades Iraqi society .
Since the 2003 invasion of their country , conditions for Iraqi youth have declined dramatically , with the destruction of the education and social infrastructure combined with mass unemployment .
The ACLU released a report last week documenting US military treatment of juveniles .
The report stated that the military ’s lack of protections and consideration for the juvenile status of detainees constitutes a violation of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict , ratified by the US in 2002 .
It also violates internationally accepted norms .
( See “ Soldiers of Misfortune : Abusive US Military Recruitment and Failure to Protect Child Soldiers ” ) .
In addition to reporting on juveniles held abroad , the US document to the UN also reviewed US policies toward recruitment of juveniles into its own military .
In a statement , the ACLU commented that the US fails to uphold its obligations to “ protect youth from recruiter misconduct such as false promises or coercion .
According to the government report , there were 2,456 claims of such recruiter misconduct in 2006 alone .
According to the Government Accountability Office , the actual number of instances is likely higher , due to poor tracking and reporting . ”
The ACLU disputed the government figures on juveniles held for some period of time at Guantánamo Bay , reporting that the number is closer to 23 .
Other estimates have put the figure as high as 60 .
Two prisoners who were captured as juveniles remain in Guantánamo Bay .
These are Mohammed Jawad , who was captured when he was about 16 , and Omar Khadr , who was captured when he was 15 .
They have both been held for over five years in inhuman conditions and subjected to torture .
They are both being tried before drumhead military commissions , and could face life sentences .
Khadr , a Canadian citizen , was shot by US Special Forces in Afghanistan in July 2002 .
Earlier this month , a US military judge rejected a defense motion arguing that Khadr ’s prosecution should cease because he was a child when arrested , and therefore should be entitled to protection and assistance .
( See “ Guantánamo judge rules Omar Khadr , arrested at 15 , can be tried as war criminal ” )
Jawad , who is now 23 , was captured in December 2002 and accused of throwing a grenade that injured two American soldiers .
He has testified that he was tortured to elicit false confessions and has refused to participate in the military commission on the grounds that it is illegal .
Hard to believe , but a grain of sand — or rather millions of them traveling at high velocity — can have a devastating effect on aircraft and industrial gas - turbine engines .
The granules eat into the zirconium dioxide ceramic thermal - barrier coatings that insulate and protect engine components from extremely high temperatures .
In an effort to protect these coatings and ensure that turbine engines continue to operate properly , a team of Ohio State University engineers is testing a new formulation of zirconium dioxide , more commonly known as zirconia .
Zirconia , which has gained notoriety outside the scientific community ( because its chemical cousin is the cubic zirconia of fake diamond fame ) , has for decades been used to make ceramic coatings for turbines because it is highly insulating .
This gives jet engines the ability to run at high temperatures — thousands of degrees Fahrenheit .
The downside : at these higher temperatures , sand and other particles drawn into the turbines stick to the ceramic , turn to molten glass , and erode the protective coating , which is about 250 microns ( 0.01 inch ) thick , says Nitin Padture , a professor of materials science and engineering at The Ohio State University .
After the engine cools , the glass solidifies into an inflexible glaze on the ceramic surface .
When the engine heats up again and the metal blades expand , the ceramic coating cannot expand because the glaze has locked it in place .
The ceramic thereby breaks off , shortening the life of the engine blades .
The solution , Padture and his team report in a recent issue of Acta Materialia , is a new coating method that changes the composition of the zirconia so that the molten glass cannot eat through and damage the turbines .
" Our innovation is a new way of making the coating by adding aluminum and titanium to the zirconia crystals , " says Padture , who has been studying thermal - barrier coatings for more than a decade .
The aluminum and titanium turns molten glass into a stable crystal that poses no danger to the underlying ceramic surface .
" The next step is to see if we can actually deposit this on turbine blades , which have a complicated shape , " he says .
The University of Connecticut , where Padture began his research , has applied for a patent on his method for strengthening zirconia , and he plans to work with Inframat Corporation , a Farmington , Conn. , nanotech company , to further develop the technology .
If their tweaked version of zirconia flies , the airline industry and military will be able to design engines that run hotter , and as such , burn fuel more efficiently and create less pollution .
Nearly four decades after the four biggest Western oil companies were expelled from Iraq by Saddam Hussein , they are negotiating their return .
By the end of the month , Royal Dutch Shell , BP , Exxon Mobil and Total will sign agreements with the Baghdad government , Iraq 's first with big Western oil firms since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
The deals are for repair and technical support in some of the country 's largest oilfields , the Oil Ministry in Baghdad said yesterday .
The return of " Big Oil " will add to the suspicions of those in the Middle East who claimed that the overthrow of Saddam was secretly driven by the West 's desire to gain control of Iraq 's oil .
It will also be greeted with dismay by many Iraqis who fear losing control of their vast oil reserves .
Iraq 's reserves are believed to be second only to Saudi Arabia in the Middle East , but their exploitation has long been hampered by UN sanctions , imposed on Iraq after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 .

The major oil companies have been eager to go back to Iraq , but are concerned about their own security and the long - term stability of the country .
The two - year no -bid agreements are service agreements that should add another 500,000 barrels of crude a day of output to Iraq 's present production of 2.5 million barrels a day ( b / d ) .
The companies have the option of being paid in cash or crude oil for the deals , each of which will reportedly be worth $ 500 m ( £ 250 m ) .
For Iraq , the agreements are a way of accessing foreign expertise immediately , before the Iraqi parliament passes a controversial new hydrocarbons law .
But they mean that the four oil companies , which originally formed the Iraq Petroleum Company to exploit Iraqi oil from the 1920s until the industry 's nationalisation in 1972 , will be well - placed to bid for contracts for the long - term development of these fields .
The oilfields affected are some of the largest in Iraq , from Kirkuk in the north to Rumaila , on the border with Kuwait .
Although there is oil in northern Iraq , most of the reserves are close to Basra , in the far south .
Since the US invasion , Iraqis have been wary of foreign involvement in their oil industry .
Many are convinced that the hidden purpose of the US invasion was to take over Iraqi oil , but the Iraqi Oil Minister , Hussein Shahristani , has said that Iraq will hold on to its natural resources .
" If Iraq needs help from international oil companies , they will be invited to co-operate with the Iraqi National Oil Company [ Inoc ] , on terms and conditions acceptable to Iraq , to generate the highest revenue for Iraq " .
Inoc 's technical expertise has deteriorated sharply during the long years of sanctions .
Iraq is currently exporting 2.1 million b/d and is expecting to have oil revenues of $ 70 bn this year , but its government administration is too dysfunctional and corrupt to rebuild the electricity or water supply systems .
The government has $ 50bn in the Federal Bank of New York .
Mr Shahristani has been highly critical of the Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) for auctioning off oil concessions in Iraqi Kurdistan without reference to the oil ministry in Baghdad .
In an interview with The Independent last year , he said Inoc would never do business with any oil company that signed up with the KRG , and he also doubted if the oil could be exported without pipelines .
" Are they going to carry it out in buckets ? " he asked .
Several of the small oil companies who have signed contracts in Kurdistan are hoping that in the long term there will be an agreement between the Kurds and the central government and they will then sell out to the majors at a large profit .

The technical support agreements , as the service agreements are known , may open the door to Iraq for the majors .
Mr Shahristani has said that Iraq will open up the same fields for bidding for long - term development projects soon .
" We 're going to announce the first licensing round by the end of this month or early next month , " he said .
The high price of oil means that Iraq is not under immediate pressure to maximise its oil revenues .
The Iraqi parliament has suspected anything which looks like giving foreign companies ownership of Iraq 's oil through a production sharing agreement .
The nationalisation of Iraq 's oil is one the few acts of Saddam Hussein 's long years in power which is still highly popular , and Iraqi members of parliament are fearful of anything that looks like back - door privatisation in the interests of foreigners .
Big four have history of control
For the four oil giants , the new agreements will bring them back to a country where they have a long history .
BP , Exxon Mobil , Total and Shell were co-owners of a British , American and French consortium that kept Iraq 's oil reserves in foreign control for more than 40 years .
The Iraq Petroleum Company ( once the Turkish Petroleum Company ) was formed in 1912 by oil companies eager to grab the resources in parts of the Ottoman Empire .
The company was formalised in 1928 and each of the four shareholders had a 23.75 per cent share of all the oil produced .
The final 5 per cent went to Calouste Gulbenkian , an Armenian businessman .
In 1931 , an agreement was signed with Iraq , giving the company complete control over the oi fields of Mosul in return for annual royalties .
After Saddam 's coup in 1958 , nationalisation came in 1972 .
A stadion közelében árult csipszekre egy alkolholszondát szereltek , ami a leheletükben lévő kis mennyiségű alkoholt is kimutatja .
Hogy ezzel ne legyen még vége a csodának , a zacskóban lévő plusz kiegészítő azt is lehetővé teszi , hogy egy Ubert rendeljen magának az ember , aminek viteldíjából 10 dollárt a Tostitos áll .

Lieber Josef !
Ezennel küldöm az anyag !
Remélem magától értődik minden .
Azon gondolkodtunk , hogy lehetne a pontosságot leginkább lényegretörően kifejezni .
Aztán felkiáltottunk : hát pontokkal !!!
No de hova kerüljenek azok a pontok ?
Elvégre nem akartunk pöttyös plakátot , mivel egy híres Quarkriegel brandnek ez a sajátossága .
Így jött az idea , hogy tegyük szavak közé – az meg , hogy a szavak legyenek a név fordításai , könnyebben adódott , mint egy Gösser , ha Schnitzelt rendel az ember .
Reménykedem , hogy nektek is tetszeni fog , gemütlicher abendet kívánok a Regionalsdirektor úrral !
Servus , Heinz
Lenne nekünk egy kampaign in Ungarn , gondoltam tudnäl küldeni valami ötlet .
Nem kell nagy wasistdas , Ungarn nem kompliziert .
Szerencse az üzenet sem kompliziert : most vagyunk rebranding mäsodik phase , szeretnenk tudatositani pontossäg ( és azt is , hogy egy Wiener eletbiztosito vagyunk , magyar ember nem beszel angol , keretik leforditani ) .
Holnap estig tudnätok küldeni valamit ?
Este Apfelstrudel Party lesz a Grabenben , át tudnám bezselni a dolgot a Regionalsdirektorral .
Jó volt újra végignézni az Operaháznak készült imidzsfilmet , amiben újra és újra lehet izgalmas részleteket felfedezni , és mindig arra késztet , hogy megint elmenjek egy előadásra .
Mind ötletben , mind kivitelesézben erős volt a Tesco mobilalkalmazásnak és a Tesco Rubik - kocka promóciójának készült film .
Itt jegyezném meg , hogy év ügyfele díjat nem adtak át , de én biztosan nekik adtam volna , annyi jó és sokrétű kampány ( film , mobil app , digitál kampány ) , amit a Tesco készített , pláne abban az iprágban , ahol árzabálók verekednek a kicsi árakkal , miközben Badár Sándor bárgyú mosollyal bíztatja a nagy piros gombot megnyomó Mautner Zsófit , duplán elismerésre méltó .
Az év ügnyöksége címet megszerző DDB ( ezúton is gratulálok nekik )
Volksagenes kampányai is jól sikerültk , bár a kuponos ötlet nekem már elsőre is amolyan " Mátyás kirány okos lány " ötletnek tűnt ( van is benne újszerűség , meg láttam már érzetem is van tőle egyszerre ) , és a mekis kampányok között is voltak kiemelked ő darabok .
Az egyetlen igazi hiányérzetem viszont éppen ezekhez kapcsolódik .
Szeretem az ötletet , szép , kerek munka , gyönyörű kivitelezéssel , de azt igazából még most sem értem , miért a Meki filmjei lettek az év kreatv terméke , én biztosan nem ezt küldtem volna egy nagy nemzetközi megmérettetésre .
De ez az én megítélésem , nem kell vele foglalkozni , és nem is szeretném , ha negatív lenne a poszt kicsengése .
Mert a lényeg , hogy jó volt ott lenne , jó volt azt érezni , hogy reklámos vagyok , köszi mindenkinek , aki ehhez bármilyen módon is hozzájárult !
Előre a végtelenbe és tovább !
( A posztba csak néhány munkát tettem be , a többit megtaláljátok a Kreatív online - on )
Kifejezetten erős kampány volt a DDB a Nyitottak vagyunk alapítványnak készített " Love Songs " elnevezés ű kampánya , amiben ismert szerelmes dalokban cserélték ki a nő neveket férfi nevekre , így állva ki a homoszexuálisok elfogadásáért .
Már akkor elismerően biccentettem , amikor a Y&R és Lego Store közös kampányát , a Margitszigetre megépített Lego mellszobrokat megláttam , és a most látott anyag is meggy őzött arról , hogy még sok díjat nyerhet ez a munka .
Büszkén láttam az én ügynökségem , az ACG a nők elleni erőszak ellenes kampányát , a Nekem is fájt , amihez szintén sok reményem fűződik még .
A Greeenromm Herosz állatotthonnak készült vírusfilmje nem csak a ciukiság overload miatt működik , a Café unicefes kampánya és a Kirowski Vörös Keresztnek készített intsa ötlete is figyelelemre méltó .
A harmadik pozitívum , a verseny lényege , maguk a reklámok voltak .
Jó volt nézni , hogy a bemutatott , kategóriagyőztes anyagok között több nemzetközi szinten is kiemelked ő munka született .
Az is jó érzés volt , hogy a közönség szemmel láthatóan és füllel hallhatóan örült ezeknek a kiemelked ő teljesítményeknek , valahogy olyan érzésem volt , mintha a szakmai féltékenység csillapodófélben lenne , és mindenkiből előbújt volna egy kis közös büszkeség .
Mintha megértették volna , hogy ez , amit látunk , a hazai reklámszakma közösen elért teljesítménye , és annak is lehet örülni , hogy ha egy adott kampányt ugyan nem mi találtunk ki , de mégiscsak a mi kicsit savanyú , kicsit sárga reklámszakmánk termelte ki .
A másik pozitívum a profi körítés és lebonyolítás volt , gördülékenyen ment az egész ( dicséret érte a Kreatív csapatának , akik idén az Epicával való együttműködésnek is hála nagyon összekapták magukat ) , talán csak az elején volt egy kis zökkenő , amikor a zsűrielnök szerette volna összefoglalni a gondolatait a zsűrizésről és a beérkezett anyagokról .
Sajnos nem volt igazán jól hallható Nagy Bálint beszéde , és ő is azt hiszem túlizgulta a dolgot , de valahogy mindenki inkább csak azt várta , hogy pontot tegyen a beszéd végére .
Pedig annak fényében , hogy milyen munkát választott a zsűri az év kreatív termékének , utólag igencsak kíváncsi lettem volna a mondanivalójára , mert a választás bizony sok kérdést felvet .
Múlt hét szerdán rendezeték meg a Hipnózis reklámversenyt , ami a második legnagyobb hazai fesztivál .
Sokan persze már azt is megkérd őjelezik , hogy egyre is minek van szükség , hiszen itt semmi más nem történik , minthogy a közepes vagy annál gyengébb hazai reklámszakma tömjénezi magát .
Ez a poszt nem erről akar szólni , nem akarok ezzel a vélekedéssel vitába szálln .
Már csak azért sem , mert szerintem teljes félreértésről van szó , mert ezeken a versenyeknek épp az a célja , hogy a rangjára emelje a kreativitást , és a reflektorfényt a kevés igazán jó kampányra irányítsa , és azokat példaként mutassa be .
Én is azért írok a Hipnózisról , mert szeretném a pozitívumokat kiemelni , és hozzájárulni ahhoz , hogy jövőre még jobb legyen .
Az HBO minden évben készül valami kis meglepetéssel a Trónok harca szezonnyitó napjára .
Idén sincs ez másképp .
Ma 11 órakor egy twitteres sárkányvadászatot indítanak el , ami egészen a premier pillanatáig tart .
A lényeg , hogy a khaleesi egyik sárkányát , a bárányokat előszeretettel elraboló Drogont kell magunkhoz csalogatni , és elkapni .
A csalogatáshoz a Giphy gifes gyűjtőoldalon kalakított Drogon csaliboltból választhatunk gifeket , amiket posztolnunk kell majd a # CatchDrogon hashtaggel .
Ezután már csak annyi dolgunk van , hogy figyeljük , ráharap-e a bestia .
Ezt úgy fogjuk észrvenni , hogy a nevünket említve posztol majd valamit Drogon ( azaz a Trónok harca csapat ) .
Ha ezt gyorsan észrevesszük , és retweeeteljük , akkor sanszunk van nyerni , a jutalmak pedig különféle extra kontentektől a Trónok harca ajándékokig terjedhetnek .
A buli persze az , hogy a gifek helyett akár egy barátunkat is posztolhatjuk csaliként , bízva abban , hogy a sárkány majd arra rabol rá , mint Habony a vitrinre , de a főnökünkről , Áder Jánosról vagy éppen Gyurcsányról kitett fotóval is csalogathatjuk Drogont .
Jó vadászatot mindenkinek !
A konferencia április 8 - án reggel kilenckor indul és másnap estig tart majd a Várkert Bazárban , jegyek még éppen hogy , de kaphatóak , érdemes még most gyorsan kattintani és regisztrálni az SM2015 honlapján , ahol a programról és más témákról is bőven találtok még infót .
Ott találkozunk !
Hazai előadók is lesznek bőven , olyan érdekes figurákkal , mint Meskó Bertalan , aki az egyik legrégebbi index blog , a mediq .
blog .hu szerz őjeként hívta fel magára először a figyelmet , Karotta , a CEMP kreatívigazgatója , vagy Francsics Ádám is , aki a ClipDis alkalmazás egyik gazdája , amely épp most ért el egy komoly nemzetközi sikert azzal , hogy bekerült a FB Messenger beépített alkalmazásai közé .
Csak ízelítőként érdemes megemlíteni például Clyde McKendrick ( a Possible digitális ügynökség nemzetközi Chief Strategy Officere ) , Ganna Yevtushenko ( Head of Business development , CEE , PayPal ) , Houlin Zhao ( az ENSZ infokommunikációs szervezetének főtitkára ) , vagy éppen Kevin Jackson nevét , aki a Gravity R&D Global Sales Directora .
Azoknak , akik a kommunikációval kapcsolatos területen dolgoznak , egész biztosan nem kell bemutatni a SmartMobil konferenciát , amely évről - évre egy nívós előadókkal és programokkal telezs úfolt rendezvényen hozta össze a szakma legjobbjait .
De azok se bánkódjanak , akiknek nem mond semmit az SM név , mert idén végre időben kapcsolhatnak és még gyorsan szabaddá tehetik magukat szerdára és csütörtökre .
Igen , két napra , mert idén már két teljes napot és négy termet is megtöltenek az előadók , akik között jónéhány igazi nagyágyút is találunk .
Döbbenetes szám , de tény , hogy Magyarországon minden 5 . nő válik valamilyen családon belüli bántalmazás áldozatává .
Az is tény , hogy napi szinten olvashatunk olyan hírt a sajtóban , amely egyértelműen nyomatékosítja : a problémáról beszélni kell , és mindenkinek ki kell állni azokért , akik sok esetben nem tudnak , nem mernek kiállni magukért .
A most indult , Nekem is fáj !
kampány célja , hogy elősegítse a témáról való nyílt beszédet és lehet őséget adjon azoknak is az ügy melletti kiállásra , akik személyesen nem éltek át hasonló inzultust , de fontosnak tartják ezt az ügyet és ezzel is szeretnék bátorítani az érintetteket .
Mindezt olyan lemosható tetoválások segítségével tehetik meg , amelyek foltokat és sérüléseket ábrázolnak .
Ezeket feltéve posztolhatnak magukról egy megdöbbentő képet , ami jelzi , hogy amikor egy nőt bántanak , ők is megtámadva érzik magukat , és a sérüléseik nekik is fájnak .
A kampány indulásakor többek között Odett , Bakos Piroska és Szegedi Kata is vállalta hogy egy különleges portréfotózás során lila foltokkal és horzsolásokkal az arcukon állnak a kamerák elé , egyben az ügy mögé , ezzel is arra buzdítva mindenkit : vásároljon ő is tetoválást és álljon ki a bántalmazott nőkért .
A nőnapi indulás óta további ismert arcok csatlakoztak a kezdeményezéshez , például Csobot Adél , Kulcsár Edyna , Lola , Mádai Viven , Metzker Viki , Sarka Kata , Tóth Gabi is lefotózta magát sokkoló ideiglenes sebekkel és használta a #nekemisfáj hashtaget .
De a A Nekem is fáj !
támogatói nem csak a fotóikkal segítenek , hiszen a jótékonysági kampány célja nemcsak a figyelemfelkeltés , hanem egy nagyobb összeg összegy űjtése is .
A többek között a Mono art&design , Insitu , Printa , Kontakt , wonderLAB és NON + boltokban , illetve a TATZ webshopjában megvásárolható lemosható tetoválások teljes árával ugyanis az Ökumenikus Segélyszervezet bántalmazott családokat befogadó menedékházát támogatják .

High in the darkening sky , a flock of enormous ravens swoop and swirl - narrow black wings stretched wide , heads protruding forward and huge hairy beaks scything through the air .
Every few minutes they let out deep , throaty , honking calls as they soar effortlessly , circling around until , finally , they spot their prey and swoop .
But forget dormice , voles or even small furry rabbits ; these sinister looking birds are feasting on something far larger - newborn lambs .

Raven attack : Farmers report a rise in the number of calves , lambs and sheep pecked to death
And instead of hanging around for a few discarded bones or a forgotten carcass to pick and claw at , they 've started killing live farm animals - by pecking them to death , in horrific scenes reminiscent of Daphne du Maurier 's The Birds , turned by Alfred Hitchcock into one of the most chilling movies of all time .
Throughout Britain , traumatised farmers have reported a sudden and disturbing rise in the number of livestock being attacked by ravens .
Farmer John Kirk , 50 , from Nethybridge , near Aviemore , has lost more than 40 animals in the past few weeks .
" It 's like something out of a horror film .
They are horrible , horrible birds .
They see the young lambs and just fly down and help themselves , " he said .
" Sometimes you find a carcass with the eyes and tongue pecked out , but sometimes all you find is the skin .
They peck away until nothing is left . "
And while some animals have been pecked to death , others have been left to die in agony after birds have feasted on their eyes , tongues and the soft flesh of their underbellies .

A raven stands perched on its latest kill
The worst - hit areas are in Scotland and Wales , but there are also reports of random attacks across the South - West and the Lake District .
The Scottish Isle of Mull has been badly hit , with one farmer losing 20 lambs in a fortnight .
Another , Robert Millar from High Catterdale , Kintyre , said : " We 've had 12 to 15 lambs attacked .
It 's got to the stage where you have to lamb indoors , or you do n't stand a chance . "
And Jimmy Mills , a farmer from Stratherrick , south of Inverness , has lost seven lambs in just three days : " The lambs are born at 1 pm and by four o'clock they 've been taken to bits by the ravens , " he says .
According to Johnny Hall , of the National Farmers Union of Scotland , it 's no longer just lambs : " Raven attacks have become a huge problem across a wide area of the country .
" We have substantial evidence of them attacking adult sheep and calves , too .
The attacks are so horrific that it 's causing mental suffering to people who find the animals . "
The worst thing is , there 's not much the farmers can do about it .
Ravens are protected by law , so farmers can't shoot them as they would other vermin .
Scroll down for more ...
They can be killed on special licence - due to a condition in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 - but only if the Government deems it appropriate .
But farmers say the system is designed for the " odd rogue bird " , not the huge swirling flocks of recent months , and are demanding the law is changed .
The question is , why have ravens suddenly started to attack livestock ?
Experts cannot give a definitive explanation , but some believe it is simply the pressure on food resources caused by the dramatically increasing raven population .
In parts of Britain ( Scotland , in particular ) experts believe numbers have increased five - fold since the late Nineties , and according to the RSPB there are up to 6,000 breeding pairs in Scotland - almost half the numbers in Europe .
Davy Thomson , vice - chairman of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association , says it is not breeding birds that cause the problem , but immature birds , scavenging in large packs .
" I 've seen several hundred birds roosting together , and all they do is hunt one side of the hill and then move onto their next food source .

Haunting scenes :
A mass attack on the town 's schoolchildren in Hitchcock 's The Birds
" Raven populations have increased massively in the past ten years , and it's an absolute nonsense that we can't control them . "
However , according to Dr Andre Farrar , spokesman for the Royal Society For The Protection Of Birds : " Some reports of raven attacks may be exaggerated , but they do kill things .
" They make a speciality out of scavenging and eating carrion .
In many cases their prey is already dead , but they 're highly capable of killing , so sometimes they 'll finish it off themselves .
" But they get an unjustly bad press .
Any big , black bird tends to come down from history with a load of negatives attached .
So the raven has got a burden of cultural mistrust around it . "
Such as its association with death , and its supposed supernatural powers of prediction .
Irish folklore has it that each raven contains three drops of the Devil 's blood , and anyone who hunted them would be on the receiving end of the Devil 's fury and a lifetime of bad luck .
Its status as a bird of ill omen is confirmed by a cameo appearance in Shakespeare 's Macbeth - as the King nears the castle at Inverness , Lady Macbeth utters the ominous words :
" The raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan under my battlements . "
Legend has it that if anything happens to the six resident ravens at the Tower of London - attended by a Yeoman Ravenmaster , and treated to a daily feast of raw meat and blood - soaked " bird biscuit " - England will be invaded .
Scroll down for more ...
Aside from all the folklore , they 're an impressive foe - up to 2ft long and worryingly adaptable : they can survive in Arctic , temperate and desert climates .
Research published last year in the Scientific American also showed the raven to be one of the most intelligent species on the planet - up there with dolphins and apes and , unlike most other birds and animals , capable of learning from their own actions and from observing others ' behaviour .
They 're thought to be one of the few birds that can count , and some have even learned to fashion leaves into special tools for extracting grubs from crevices in trees .
In Japan , they were reportedly found dropping nuts onto a dual - carriageway , then darting down to eat them once the cars had cracked them open .
Although older ravens ( they live up to 25 years ) mate for life and travel in pairs , young birds may form flocks of up to several hundred - collective nouns for ravens include an " unkindness " , a " conspiracy " , and a " murder " - which swoop on farm animals .
They were almost exterminated during the 19th century , but in the past 20 years have made their dramatic comeback , partially because they have been protected .
As Dr Farrar puts it : " A few years ago , you 'd hope to see them only in Scotland , or Wales , but now they 're popping up in parts of eastern England - they 've even been spotted in Bedfordshire . "
But he insists it 's not all bad .
" Ravens are truly spectacular birds , with an amazing display flight - they flip over into a half - roll and back again when they 're flying - and have a deep sonorous croaking call .
They 're stunning to watch . "
Which all sounds rather poetic , but must be scant comfort for the farmer rendered helpless as another dark , swirling , unkindness of ravens starts circling in the skies over his lambs .

House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , Michigan Democrat , threatened to subpoena Karl Rove , former deputy chief of staff for President Bush , if he continues to refuse to testify before Conyers ’ committee about the firing of former U.S. attorneys .
Here is the letter Conyers and several other members of the committee sent to Rove ’s attorney , Robert Luskin at Patton Boggs .
( You can also view the letter Luskin sent Conyers yesterday here . )
May 1 , 2008
Via Fax and U.S. Mail
Mr. Robert D. Luskin
Patton Boggs LLP
2550 M Street , N.W .
Washington , D.C. 20037-1350
Dear Mr. Luskin :
We were very disappointed to receive your April 29 letter declining the invitation to Karl Rove to testify voluntarily before the House Judiciary Committee concerning the politicization of the Department of Justice , including allegations regarding the prosecution of former Governor Don Siegelman .
Particularly since your client has made a number of on - the - record comments on this subject to the media , and in light of your ( now modified ) statement that Mr. Rove would be willing to testify , we can see no justification for his refusal to speak on the record to the Committee .
We urge you and your client to reconsider this refusal no later than May 12 , or we will have no choice but to consider the use of compulsory process .
Mr. Rove has previously spoken to the media and on the record concerning both the Siegelman case and the firings of U.S. Attorneys in 2006 .
Your letter , however , offers to make Mr. Rove available only for a non-transcribed staff interview , not under oath , and limited only to the Siegelman matter .
This offer is completely unacceptable .
Initially , an interview conducted without a transcript and not under oath would frustrate a full and fair inquiry .
An interview without a transcript is an invitation to confusion and will not permit us to obtain a straightforward and clear record , as several of us have explained in response to a similar offer by White House counsel Fred Fielding in the U.S. Attorney matter .
As Republican former Congressman Mickey Edwards has written , “ [ n ] o Congress , indeed no lawyer , would ever agree to such an outrageous ” proposal .
We simply do not understand why anyone who is prepared to tell the truth would object to an oath and a record of what is said .
This is particularly true in this case , where Mr. Rove has already spoken on the record on this subject .
Indeed , your proposal is even more restrictive than Mr. Fielding ’s offer , since you would explicitly exclude any questioning concerning the U.S. Attorney firings .
As your own letter appears to recognize , the Siegelman and other selective prosecution matters and the U. S. Attorney firings are clearly related as part of the concerns our Committee has been investigating on the politicization of the Justice Department under this Administration .
It would further impede our inquiry to seek artificially to separate these issues .
We can see no reason why Mr. Rove would be willing to testify as to whether he put improper pressure on a federal prosecutor to bring a prosecution , but would not be willing to testify on whether he improperly sought to retaliate against federal prosecutors by having them fired .
Your letter also raises concerns about possible executive privilege claims with respect to Mr. Rove ’s testimony .
The proper way to address such concerns , however , is on a question - by - question basis as current Administration officials have done in testifying before the Committee , not by a blanket refusal to testify .
We hope you and your client will reconsider the decision not to testify on a voluntary basis .
Please direct any questions and your response to the Judiciary Committee office , 2138 Rayburn House Office Building , Washington , DC 20515 ( tel : 202-225-3951 ; fax : 202-225-7680 ) .

Ms Blay said children are asked to kill themselves in front of a webcam
Historian Celia Blay , from Maidenhead , said she came across the man when speaking to a troubled teenager .
He makes contact with vulnerable children and encourages them to take their lives while he watches them through a webcam , she said .
Ms Blay claims she has discovered he is based in the US Midwest and has reported it to the police .
She said she stumbled across him while she was having an online conversation with a troubled teenager she was trying to help .
[ He ] is very sympathetic but never , ever suggests that they seek help
Celia Blay , historian
" He does n't really mind who his victims are .
He tells them how to hang themselves and how to hang themselves in front of a webcam , " she said .
" He is very sweet , he pretends to be an emergency room nurse .
" He calls them ' hun ' and ' darling ' and this sort of thing and is very sympathetic but never , ever suggests that they seek help . "
Paul Kelly , from the suicide prevention charity Papyrus , said the current law cannot do anything to stop such people .
In 2001 , Mr Kelly 's son Simon took his own life after obtaining instructions from a an internet suicide website .
Mr Kelly said : " The Suicide Act goes back to 1961 , which obviously predates the very existence of the internet and we regard it as being quite ineffective to challenge the current development . "
He added that there was very little police could do in such cases , unless there were clear links and proof connecting the predator with the victim .
It is possible to slash fuel use by all vehicles on U.S. roads to pre-2000 levels within a few decades , but doing so would require immediate action on several challenging fronts , according to a new analysis by MIT researchers .
Left unchecked , U.S. vehicle fuel use is expected to rise to about 765 billion liters of gasoline equivalent per year by 2035 , up 35 percent from 2005 , according to the researchers .
Their analysis shows , however , that hybrids , plug - in hybrids and other advanced vehicle systems could be incorporated into America 's vehicle fleet rapidly enough to make a significant dent in total fuel use by 2035 .
Reductions would come faster if Americans were to start to use technology improvements to make mainstream gasoline vehicles more fuel efficient , and to adopt measures to slow the growth in demand for vehicles and the distance they travel .
Among the biggest hurdles will be changing consumer expectations .
Â
In order to make a dent in fuel use , vehicle makers will have toÂ emphasize fuel efficiency over other vehicle improvements .
InÂ other words , consumers will need to understand that next year 's modelÂ wo n't necessarily accelerate faster or be bigger than last year ' sÂ model , but it will get more miles per gallon .
" The magnitude of the changes required to achieve these reductions is daunting , especially as current trends all run counter to those changes , " said Anup Bandivadekar , who until recently was a postdoctoral associate in the MIT Energy Initiative and is now an analyst at the International Council on Clean Transportation .
John B. Heywood , the Sun Jae Professor of Mechanical Engineering and director of MIT 's Sloan Automotive Laboratory , Bandivadekar and others developed the models key to the study .
Research has shed light on future fuel economy and emissions improvements possible with specific technologies .
But knowing the potential impact on total fuel use and emissions requires understanding how quickly those technologies are likely to get on the road , how much difference they will make and when .
Bandivadekar and colleagues set out to answer those questions .
" Like everyone else , we do n't have the ability to predict the future , " said Bandivadekar , who received his PhD from MIT 's Engineering Systems Division earlier this year .
" So we develop various transportation scenarios , each of which combines a number of vehicle technologies , assuming that their market shares grow at different -- but plausible - - rates between now and 2035 .
We then assess the impact of each scenario on fleet - wide fuel use and emissions . "
Conversely , given a fuel use or emissions target , their methodology can determine plausible pathways for getting there .
The researchers compared fuel use for different scenarios that would meet projected demand for light - duty vehicles between now and 2035 .
For each , they assumed that half of all technology improvements would be used directly to increase fuel economy , a variable they call " emphasis on reducing fuel consumption , " or ERFC .
In the first scenario , by 2035 the advanced technologies considered in the study -- turbocharged gasoline , diesels , gasoline hybrids and plug - in hybrids -- have gained fractions of the U.S. market , but over a third of all cars sold are still conventional gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles .
In the second , battery development stalls , hybrids remain expensive , but turbocharged gasoline and diesel vehicles do well , taking over 75 percent of the market by 2035 .
The third scenario assumes that hybrids and plug - in hybrids succeed and by 2035 they make up 55 percent of the market .
The hybrid - strong scenario gives the largest cut in fuel use .
Further , if combined with 100 percent ERFC , fuel use in 2035 is almost 40 percent lower than it would be if no action were taken .
" Now you 're talking really big reductions , " Bandivadekar said .
" Despite enormous growth in demand , fuel use in 2035 would be lower than it was in 2000 . "
The overall message ?
" If our goal is to achieve deep , long - term reductions in fuel use and emissions we should do all these things -- increase the ERFC , improve today 's engines , increase the market penetration rate of advanced propulsion technologies and find ways to reduce the rate of growth in demand .
With that combination we can get very deep cuts by 2035 , " Bandivadekar said .
" To make those things happen , we need strong , long - term policies and we need to adopt them now because the longer we wait the higher the starting point is and the more difficult the task . "

NEW HAVEN , Connecticut – Internet service providers that monitor their networks for copyright infringement or bandwidth hogs may be committing felonies by breaking federal wiretapping laws , a panel said Thursday .
University of Colorado law professor Paul Ohm , a former federal computer crimes prosecutor , argues that ISPs such as Comcast , AT&T and Charter Communications that are or are contemplating ways to throttle bandwidth , police for copyright violations and serve targeted ads by examining their customers ' internet packets are putting themselves in criminal and civil jeopardy .
" These ISPs are getting close to the line of illegality and may be violating the law , " Ohm told conference goers at the Computers , Freedom and Privacy conference Thursday .
Charter 's proposed test of a system that eavesdrops on the URLs its customers visit , in order to serve them targeted ads , has already spurred a powerful Congressman to question whether the scheme would violate the Cable Act .
For its part , Comcast 's heavy - handed throttling of peer - to - peer sharing by sending fake stop messages to its customers has the Federal Communications Commission holding hand - wringing public hearings over whether it should ban the practice as being inconsistent with its open network principles .
But Ohm thinks the legal quandary is simpler .
These schemes all seem to violate the Wiretap Act , a federal statute banning eavesdropping that comes with criminal and civil penalties .
That law has some exceptions for service providers to monitor content , but only when necessary to deliver service , or to protect the company 's " rights and property . "
In fact , Ohm thinks network system administrators could themselves be in legal trouble , just for following orders from their bosses to install monitoring devices .
" Not only is this a five - year felony , it also has individual accountability , " Ohm said .
" The sys admin could be sued individually and prosecuted individually If you are asked by your manager to go and do this kind of monitoring , you yourself may be legally exposed . "
Fellow panelist Michael McKeehan , a director of Internet and Technology Policy for Verizon , said his company shares the same legal concerns , which is why it has explicitly said it has no plans to build filters to look for copyright infringers , as AT&T has it is interested in doing .
" As far as copyright filtering at the net level goes , Verizon is not doing it , " McKeehan said .
" We see significant legal and policy issues that need study . "
He cited privacy issues with monitoring customers , increased liability if the filtering solution misses something and the possibility of falsely identifying a legitimate file transfer with an illicit one , and the possibility that filters will lead to a encryption war with file sharing software , which is already turning to crypto to hide p2 p packets from Comcast 's filters .
" Do we want to deputize the middle man in this process ? " McKeehan asked , sceptically .
Not surprisingly , the panel did not include anyone from an ISP that is filtering or talking about filtering packets .
Those ISPs skipped even an FCC hearing in Stanford last month .
But surprisingly , the head lawyer for Intel 's System Technology Lab , Brad Biddle did show up , registering Intel 's disapproval of network filters – especially mandated ones – on the grounds they could slow innovation and even eventually trickle down to hardware makers .
" If you filter for copyright content at the network level , why not filter at the device level ? "
Biddle asked .
" The next step is to have devices screen for watermarks . "
Devices and services like the SlingBox , which lets people view their cable television connection using remote devices , could easily be collateral damage of network copyright filters .
" If they are n't going to be allowed to evolve , we all lose , " Biddle said .
The movie and music industry is pushing hard to have states and federal government require filters on university networks , and successfully got Tennessee to pass a law earlier this month that would require schools to beef up content filtering any year that a school got more than 50 copyright infringement notices , according to panelist Steven Worona of EDUCAUSE , which represents university IT departments .
" The RIAA would love to have filter mandates – state or federal , " Worona said , calling universities easy , but wrong targets .
" We are the only ISPs that are trying to inform clients or customers that what they are trying to do is illegal , " Worona said .
When asked whether Verizon tried to numerically identify known child pornography images , McKeehan said it had given up on a trial of software to check email attachments , in part because the technology can be defeated by changing a single pixel in the image or slightly resizing it .
" They may be perverts but they are not stupid , " McKeehan said .
But Ohm is n't convinced that lawmakers will see it that way , and forsees a bill requiring filtering for child pornography – an issue sometimes called the skeleton key to the Constitution .
" Once you have a mandate built into the law and you give an order that they build in the surveillance architecture , then it is a shorter walk to get Congress to extend that mandate , " Ohm said .

OUR PERSONAL SITES , once our primary points of online presence , are becoming sock drawers for displaced first - person content .
We are witnessing the disappearance of the all - in - one , carefully designed personal site containing professional information , links , and brief bursts of frequently updated content to which others respond via comments .
Did I say we are witnessing the traditional personal site ’s disappearance ?
That is inaccurate .
We are the ones making our own sites disappear .
Obliterating our own readership and page views may not be a bad thing , but let ’s be sure we are making conscious choices .
Interactive art director Jody Ferry ’s site is a perfect example of the deeply decentralized personal page .
I use the term “ page ” advisedly , as Jody ’s site consists of a single page .
It ’s a fun , punchy page , bursting with personality , as intriguing for what it hides as what it reveals .
Its clarity , simplicity , and liquidity demonstrate that Jody Ferry does indeed practice what the site ’s title element claims : Interactive Art Direction and User Experience Design .
All very good .
It could almost be the freshened - up splash page of a late 1990s personal site , except that the navigation , instead of pointing inward to a contact page , resume , blog , link list , and photos , points outward to external web services containing those same things .
Mentally insert interactive diagram here : at left is a 1990s site whose splash page links to sub-pages .
Structurally , its site map is indistinguishable from an org chart , with the CEO at the top , and everyone else below .
At right , to re-use the org chart analogy , a site like Jody ’s is akin to a single - owner company with only virtual ( freelance ) employees .
There is nothing below the CEO .
All arrows point outward .
Most personal sites are not yet as radically personal - content - outsourced as Jody ’s , and certainly not every personal site will go this way .
( Jody ’s site might not even be this way tomorrow , and , lest it be misunderstood , I think Jody ’s site is great . )
But many personal sites are leaning this way .
Many so inclined are currently in an interim state not unlike what ’s going on here at zeldman.com :
There are blog posts here , but I post Tweets far more frequently than I write posts .
( For obvious reasons : when you ’re stuck in an airport , it ’s easier to send a 140 - character post via mobile phone and Twitter than it is to write an essay from that same airport .
Or really from anywhere .
Writing is hard , like design . )
To connect the dots , I insert my latest Tweet in my sidebar .
I have more readers here than followers at Twitter , but that could change .
Are they the same readers ?
Increasingly , to the best of my knowledge , there are people who follow me on Twitter but do not read zeldman.com ( and vice - versa ) .
This is good ( I ’m getting new readers ) and arguably maybe not so good ( my site , no longer the core of my brand , is becoming just another piece of it ) .
Like nearly everyone , I outsource discoverable , commentable photography to Flickr.com instead of designing my own photo gallery like my gifted colleagues Douglas Bowman and Todd Dominey .
Many bloggers now embed mini-bits of their Flickr feeds in their site ’s sidebars .
I may get around to that .
( One reason I have n’t rushed to do it is that most of my Flickr photos are hidden behind a “ friends and family ” gateway , as I mainly take pictures of our kid . )
Photography was never what this site was about , so for me , using Flickr is not the same as outsourcing the publication of some of my content .
As I ’ve recently mentioned , links , once a primary source of content ( and page views ) here , got offloaded to Ma.gnolia a while back .
From 1995 until a few years ago , every time I found a good link , an angel got his wings and I got page views .
My page views were n’t , brace yourself for an ugly word , monetized , so all I got out of them was a warm feeling — and that was enough .
Now my site is , brace yourself again , monetized , but I send my readers to Ma.gnolia every time I find a link .
Go figure .
I ’m not trying to get rid of my readers , nor are you trying to shake off yours .
In the short term , including Flickr , Twitter , and Ma.gnolia or De.licio.us feeds sends traffic both ways — out to those services , but also back to your site .
( Remember when some of us were afraid RSS would cost us our readers ?
It did and it did n’t .
With RSS , good writers gain readers while often losing traditional page views .
But that ’s another story . )
I ’ve certainly found new websites by going to the Twitter profile pages of people who write funny or poignant Tweets .
Behind a great Flickr photo may be a great designer whose site you might not have found if not for first seeing that photo .
But outsourcing the publication of our own content has long - term implications that point to more traffic for the web services we rely on , and less traffic and fewer readers for ourselves .
This is not necessarily a bad thing .
Not every person who designs websites needs to run a personal magazine on top of all their other responsibilities .
If your goal in creating a personal site way back when was to establish an online presence , meet other people who create websites , have fun chatting with virtual friends , and maybe get a better job , well , you do n’t need a deep personal site to achieve those goals any more .
But if world domination is your goal , think twice before offloading every scrap of you .

The Organic Consumers Association announced Friday it was “ expanding its boycott of Horizon and Aurora organic dairy products to include five national ‘ private label ’ organic milk brands supplied by Aurora , as well as two leading organic soy products , Silk and White Wave . ”
Aurora , who supplies “ organic ” milk for Costco , Safeway ’s ‘ O ” brand , Publix , Nature ’s Promise , and Wild Oat ’s “ organic ” dairy line was found to be violating animal welfare law .
In truth , Aurora operates like a factory farm , milking 2,000 to 10,000 cows , confining cattle to feedlots , ordering replacement cows , and potentially using antibiotics .
A farmer the OCA spoke with said “ real organic dairy farms do n’t need to buy replacement heifers . ”
The new cattle are brought in only on industrial scale farms where cows are pushed to high levels of milk production , sometimes slaughtered after only a year or two after they stop milking often due to stress .
Check out the report to read more on how Bush kept Aurora rolling under the mask of the “ organic ” label .
If this makes you want to switch from organic milk to soymilk , think twice before buying Silk brand ( or White Wave tofu for that matter ) .
The OCA argues Silk sources a percentage of their soy from Brazil and China , not only increasing their carbon footprint but also buying from a country whose soy industry is destroying the Amazon .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton will win several state nominating contests in the coming months but has little chance of becoming the party ’s candidate for the November 2008 election , traders were betting on Tuesday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Traders in the Dublin - based Intrade prediction market gave Democratic front - runner Barack Obama an 86 percent chance of being the Democratic presidential nominee , versus a 12.8 percent for Clinton , the New York senator and former first lady .
Results were similar on the Iowa Electronic Markets at the University of Iowa , with traders giving Obama an 82.9 percent chance of winning , versus a 12.8 percent chance for Clinton .
Intrade traders were betting the Democratic nominee would ultimately become president .
They gave the Democrat a 59.1 percent chance of winning , versus a 48.8 percent chance for the Republican .
Iowa traders gave the Democrat a 57.1 percent chance of winning , versus 46.3 percent for the Republican .
Prediction exchanges let traders buy and sell contracts on the likelihood of future events .
Contracts are structured so the prices can be read as a percent likelihood of an event occurring .
Studies of prediction markets have shown they have an accuracy comparable to that of public opinion polls .
Expectations that Illinois Sen. Obama would be the Democratic presidential nominee have strengthened from 75 percent a month ago .
During that time Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president , has weathered a political storm over controversial statements made by the pastor of his church and has delivered a well - received speech on race in America .
The strong view of Obama ’s ultimate success came despite expectations that Clinton would win several important state nominating contests in the coming months .
Intrade traders were betting Clinton would win the contest in Pennsylvania on April 22 , giving her a 66.1 percent chance , versus 32.8 percent for Obama .
They gave her a 79 percent chance of winning the West Virginia contest on May 13 , versus 20.5 percent for Obama , and a 70 percent chance of winning in Kentucky on May 20 , versus 30.5 percent for Obama .
Traders were betting Obama would win the Indiana contest on May 6 .
They gave him a 58 percent chance , versus 45 percent for Clinton .
Traders gave him an 88 percent chance of winning the May 20 Oregon contest , versus 12 percent for Clinton , and an 82.5 percent chance of winning the June 3 Montana contest , versus 17.5 percent chance for Clinton .
This is bad … very , very bad .
So before hitting that play button , do n’t forget that you ’ve been warned .

Navigation is the most significant element in web design .
Since web - layouts do n’t have any physical representation a user can stick to , consistent navigation menu is one of the few design elements which provide users with some sense of orientation and guide them through the site .
Users should be able to rely on it which is why designers should n’t mess around with it .

Since web - layouts do n’t have any physical representation a user can stick to , consistent navigation menu is one of the few design elements which provide users with some sense of orientation and guide them through the site .
Users should be able to rely on it which is why designers should n’t mess around with it .
That ’s why in most cases it ’s where simple , intuitive and conventional solutions are usually the best option .
However , it does n’t mean that they need to be boring .
One year ago we ’ve presented modern approaches of navigation design .
Let ’s take a look at what ’s different now , which trends one can observe and what ideas you can develop further in your projects .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
This article presents historical trends , examples and innovative solutions for design of 2008 navigation menus .
The images are not clickable and do not lead to the sites from which they ’ve been taken - all is gone .
1 . Trend toward “ speaking ” block navigation
The most significant task a navigation menu has to fulfill is to unambiguously guide the visitors through the different sections of the site .
However , often it ’s quite hard to communicate the content of a site section within one or two single keywords , particularly if horizontal navigation is in use .
That ’s why often navigation options are n’t simply listed one after each other using some appropriate keyword ( “ silent ” navigation ) ; instead , designers attempt to concretely explain which options are available and what the visitor should expect from site sections once clicking on corresponding links .
In fact , over the last months we ’ve observed a strong trend toward exactly this navigation scheme ; and since designers try to initiate a more effective dialogue with visitors we prefer to call it “ speaking ” navigation — contrary to “ silent ” navigation based upon the listing of keywords .
To make the perception of information easier , the navigation is often structured by using blocks of the same height and width ; large icons are used quite often , but in most cases the decision whether they are appropriate or not depends on the content of the site and the overall layout .
“ Soft ” hover - effects often support the navigation design by making the browsing more pleasant .
This navigation scheme can be used not only for the horizontal navigation ; it can be applied to vertical navigation as well .
2. Mac - style still popular ?
One can discuss if the Mac - style is the survivor of the Web 2.0 design attack or it becomes a standalone design element used independently from glossy colorful buttons with 3D - effects .
Or maybe it ’s just a temporary trends toward grunge style — nobody knows , really .
In any case over the last months a number of websites integrated Mac - styled - navigation in their websites .
What ’s interesting is that the style is used not only on Apple - related sites , but also on websites which are n’t directly related to Mac .
Particularly when it comes to design of software products traditional Mac - style is often imitated .
Reason : it is visually appealing and looks cool .
A navigation bar does n’t need to look exactly like a typical Mac - style - navigation .
Variations are also possible .
" Green " version of the traditional Mac - style menu
Since navigation bars can’t exist alone and need to be supported by the overall design , colorful one - page - sites with happy talk and overused stock photos designers are being replaced with more decent , serious and calm layouts .
And that ’s a good thing .
However , when using the Mac - style please keep in mind that it should n’t be used for the sake of it but has to fit to the overall design .
3 . Visually appealing icons are used more often
To communicate navigation options in a more effective way , designers often make use of appealing icons .
In such cases it ’s important to make sure that the icon is easily recognizable , clearly conveys the message , corresponds to the link it stands for and is n’t too small .
Attractive icons are , of course , always preferred to the boring ones .
Icons can also be hidden into the links ; this effect should be used sparingly .
Icons can be placed on the left - hand side …
… and on the right - hand side in the sidebar .
4. Vertical tabs
Although traditional desktop - applications almost never make use of vertical tabs , in the office vertical tabs are used at least as often as horizontal ones .
In fact , designers often try it out ; and the results can be quite interesting .
Before using vertical tabs you should make sure that it is possible within your layout and you actually have enough area to cover all navigation options on every single page .
And , of course , the text is harder to read .
Tabs on the right - hand side .
5. Handwriting in use .
Recently we already discussed the hand - drawing style in modern web - design .
And what holds for design layouts also holds for its specific elements — for instance , for navigation .
6. Experimental solutions
Although it ’s usually not the best idea to come up with some strange and / or unique site navigation , designers tend to risk crazy and uncommon experiments .
When trying out something new , make sure that you do n’t put the usability of your site in danger by creating unnecessary barriers for your visitors .
Any navigation menu fails if users ca n’t make sense out of it .
DesignForFun uses icons to help visitors to filter the content they ’re looking for .
Depending on the clicked icon the background of corresponding links changes .
However , the selection of icons may be not the best one as it ’s unclear hat icons stand for .
Fortunately , title attribute is in use .
Interesting concept : the hover - effect on jBunti depends on the selected month of the year .
Warm months are associated with reddish colors , cold months with blueish colors .
12 hover - colors in use .
Playground Blues tries out something completely different ; each of 12 site sections has its color in the left sidebar .
Once the visitor hovers the mouse arrow over the left - hand sidebar the icons pop up providing visitors with navigation options .
Title - attribute is used as well .
And to make sure visitors actually can find the navigation the icons pop out like harmonica first time the page is loaded .
Steven Holl is an architect .
Which is why his navigation menu looks like an architectural sketch .
Each navigation option is given some weight in the map — apparently according to its weight on the site .
Polkdesign uses a calender as the central navigation element .
Flash .
Hopkingdesign offers not a tabbed - navigation ; it ’s a vertical navigation placed at the top of the page .
Looks at least unusual .
No , Adipintilie.eu has navigation options also placed at the top ; however , these are only external links .
Flash - based 3D - effect used on Gol.com.pl .
The menu can also be expanded .
The navigation on Wards - Exchange .co.uk fits to the brochure design .
Or the other way around .
On Kriesi.at the hovered navigation option is dynamically expanded and shows the icons which illustrate what to expect in the section of the site .
The effect is in this case not necessary .
Not really new , but still beautiful .
Folietto .at uses the free area effectively and sparingly .
You may notice an interesting visual effect when hovering the links .
inBloom has a menu with animation .
The beetle does n’t care what option you choose , it crawls its long path through the navigation tree anyway .
This is an example of how animation can be unobtrusive .
Cobahair .co.uk uses only BIG typography …
… and HelloColor.com uses small typography with rainbow colors .
Carbonstudio.co.uk delivers a Flash - based navigation menu with sound - effects .
It may sound annoying , but it is n’t : every navigation option has its own sound .
If you train yourself a little bit you can even play your own melody while listening to birds in the background .
Maxandlous.com provides hover - effects with visual hints .
It looks nice and unusual .

Nickad ’s Flash - based construct becomes visible only if the mouse is clicked and remains being clicked .
Nike offers a kind of remote control .
To navigate you need to click and drag .
While dragging , move the mouse up to move forward , down to move backward , and left / right to turn .
Literature Network » Mark Twain » Letters from the Earth » Satan's Letter
This is a strange place , and extraordinary place , and interesting .
There is nothing resembling it at home .
The people are all insane , the other animals are all insane , the earth is insane , Nature itself is insane .
Man is a marvelous curiosity .
When he is at his very very best he is a sort of low grade nickel - plated angel ; at is worst he is unspeakable , unimaginable ; and first and last and all the time he is a sarcasm .
Yet he blandly and in all sincerity calls himself the " noblest work of God . "
This is the truth I am telling you .
And this is not a new idea with him , he has talked it through all the ages , and believed it .
Believed it , and found nobody among all his race to laugh at it .
Moreover -- if I may put another strain upon you -- he thinks he is the Creator 's pet .
He believes the Creator is proud of him ; he even believes the Creator loves him ; has a passion for him ; sits up nights to admire him ; yes , and watch over him and keep him out of trouble .
He prays to Him , and thinks He listens .
Is n't it a quaint idea ?
Fills his prayers with crude and bald and florid flatteries of Him , and thinks
He sits and purrs over these extravagancies and enjoys them .
He prays for help , and favor , and protection , every day ; and does it with hopefulness and confidence , too , although no prayer of his has ever been answered .
The daily affront , the daily defeat , do not discourage him , he goes on praying just the same .
There is something almost fine about this perseverance .
I must put one more strain upon you : he thinks he is going to heaven !
He has salaried teachers who tell him that .
They also tell him there is a hell , of everlasting fire , and that he will go to it if he does n't keep the Commandments .
What are Commandments ?
They are a curiosity .
I will tell you about them by and by .
Britney Spears Surprise Appearance on MTV Last Night
Last night 's grand finale of MTV 's reality competition Rock the Cradle brought many surprises and one of them was .
No , she did n't sing but she was in the audience .
Britney 's old manager and maybe new manager , Larry Rudolph , is an executive producer on the show .
He mentioned to Britney earlier in the day that the finale would be later that evening so the pop star decided to surprise him and stopped by to say hi .
Earlier in the day Britney enjoyed a visit with her young sons .
Rudolph was reportedly thrilled that she came to support him and remarked that she was there not seeking publicity but was genuinely interested in lending her support to his show .
She was with her security detail and spent most of her time behind the stage , and out of the limelight .
The shows top three finalists were Jess Blaze Snider ( Dee Snider 's son ) , Chloe Lattanzi ( Olivia Newton - John 's daughter ) and Crosby Loggins ( Kenny Loggin 's son . )
If you did not watch the show and plan to watch it later STOP READING NOW !
Crosby Loggins took top honors and second place went to Jess Blaze Snider ( interesting middle name ) , which leaves Chloe in the clean up spot .
Loggins landed the $ 100,000 recording contract .
It looks like all those keyboard lessons from the age of seven paid off .
Fighting a fierce north wind and cresting waves , a dozen Cucapa Indian fishermen were in trouble before they were halfway home , their small boats and balky outboard motors overmatched by the roiling estuary of the Colorado River Delta .
“ Malo viento , ” muttered Julio Figueroa , as he nosed his boat slowly through the wind - whipped waves , his feet submerged in 10 inches of standing water .
Boats have capsized and men have drowned in these waters , where river and sea collide .
Many others have drifted out to sea after waterlogged motors stalled .
The Cucapa say that every year they must venture farther downstream , braving some of the highest spring tides in the world .
Rough seas are n’t the only hazard .
It is illegal to fish here .
The waters are part of a federal sanctuary created to protect several imperiled marine species .
Although getting caught could cost them their boats , the Cucapa say they have little choice .
Upstream , where the current is slower and the fishing legal , there is not enough water anymore and , consequently , not enough fish .
FOR THE RECORD :
An earlier online version of this report said the Colorado River traverses seven of the most arid U.S. states .
It provides water for seven of the most arid U.S. states .
As U.S. scientists warn of a semi- permanent drought along the taxed river by midcentury , Mexico today offers a glimpse of what dry times can be like .
Rationing is in effect in some areas .
Farmers have abandoned crops they can no longer irrigate .
Experts fear that the desert will reclaim some of the region ’s most fertile land .
The Cucapa are a tiny portion of the 3 million people in northern Mexico who depend on a meager allotment of Colorado River water that was not enough when it was granted by treaty in 1944 , and is far from enough now .
Traversing 1,440 miles and providing water for seven of the most arid U.S. states , the Colorado River arrives here as an intermittent stream laden with sewage , fertilizer , pesticides and salts leached from farmland .
The Cucapa and their ancestors have been living in the Colorado River Delta for 1,000 years , sustaining themselves on what once were lush wetlands .
As the river and its surroundings dried up , most of the Cucapa went elsewhere .
Today , the handful who remain -- fewer than 200 -- cling to a water - starved environment that is as imperiled as they are .
Every year at this time , the Cucapa head for the “ zono nucleo , ” the core of the marine reserve where the river meets the Gulf of California .
Playing cat and mouse with police patrols , the Indians net corvina , a commercially popular fish that can bring them as much money in a month as they can earn in a year working in fields or doing other manual labor .
This spring day , the Cucapa fishermen would have had unusually good luck if the weather had n’t turned against them .
The corvina were plentiful and the patrols nowhere in sight .
But the wind did n’t let up , and by midafternoon many of the overloaded Cucapa boats were riding precariously low in the choppy water .
As they retreated upriver , one boat lodged on a sandbar , forcing its crew to dump a third of its catch before the men could free their boat .
Then another boat -- with Figueroa ’s stepson aboard -- began to go down , its bow slowly submerging as the two - man crew yelled for help and the pilot frantically tried to guide the boat to shore before the motor gave out .
The men on the stricken boat were eventually rescued , though Figueroa was powerless to help , as he would have had to turn his own heavily laden boat broadside to the waves and almost surely capsized .
Nor could he ignore the rapidly receding tide , which could strand him on the riverbed far from home .
One hundred years ago , 30 - ton steamboats made their way up the mouth of the Colorado .
Now , at low tide , there is no longer enough water flowing downriver to float the Cucapa ’s 20 - foot - long pangas and their cargo .
For all his hard work , Figueroa ended the day mired in the nearly dry riverbed , a mile short of his destination , his fish losing much of their freshness and value .
“ Malo viento , ” he kept saying .
But it was the river , not an “ evil wind , ” that had let him down .
Dams , drought , climate change , urban growth , industrial agriculture and politics on both sides of the border are to blame , and none of those adverse conditions will reverse any time soon .
Reservoirs have been drawn down to historically low levels , and some scientists predict that under the influence of climate change , the river ’s annual flow could drop by 50 % over the next 40 years .
Despite heavy snowfall in the central Rocky Mountains this year , river managers in the U.S. continue to advise the states that depend on the Colorado River to prepare for water shortages within five years .
Measures to shore up U.S. reserves , meanwhile , are likely to make water even more scarce in Mexico .
For many years , Mexico has benefited from an unofficial surplus over its meager original allotment of river flow .
The extra water comes from a combination of underground seepage from an unlined diversion canal in California , and storm runoff that makes its way south of the border .
The U.S. is in the process of stanching the fugitive flow by lining much of the All American Canal , a 90 - mile - long irrigation ditch in California ’s Imperial Valley .
Plans also are underway to build a small reservoir to catch 60 % to 70 % of the surplus surface water before it reaches Mexico .
The extra water has been a boon to crops in the arid Mexicali Valley and a godsend to the Colorado River Delta , where the Cucapa and hundreds of other poor fishermen eke out a living .
Marine biologists believe that the corvina and other fish rebounded from the brink of extinction largely as a result of periodic high flows that flushed through the mouth of the river .
“ To the extent it survives at all , the environment down there lives off the slop , off unplanned releases , ” said Peter Culp , a water lawyer and consultant to the Tucson - based Sonoran Institute , a nonprofit group that has been working on delta restoration .
Without the surplus , farmers in the Mexicali Valley say they will have to fallow land , cut their workforce and rely on aquifers that are already being pumped at an unsustainable rate .
“ Some people will be put out of work .
Others will have to reduce their standard of living , ” said Leopoldo Hurtado , who farms 40 acres south of Los Algodones , near the border .
“ We will have to pay to dig deeper wells and raise fewer crops . ”
A recent study published by San Diego State University estimates that the production of some fruits and vegetables in the Mexicali Valley will drop by more than half over the next 20 years .
More than 7,000 farm families could lose their livelihoods , according to Mexicali economist Enrique Rovirosa .
For much of northern Mexico , the only supplement to the Colorado River is groundwater .
But in a desert region that receives about 3 inches of rainfall a year , overdrafting is a perennial danger .
Millions of acres of farmland across northern Sonora and the delta have already been abandoned because groundwater supplies were exhausted , according to a report in Earthscape , an online journal of natural resources sponsored by Columbia University .
The same thing may be happening in northern Baja ’s Guadalupe Valley , one of Mexico ’s most productive winemaking regions .
“ The symptoms of desertification are undeniable , ” said Antonio Badan , a local vintner and an oceanographer at CICESE , Mexico ’s Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education .
“ Olive trees and carob trees are dying .
The tomato farms are gone .
Four of my five wells are dry .
We are clearly on a collision course with a catastrophe . ”
More to the point , the Guadalupe Valley is on a collision course with Ensenada , the fast - growing Pacific Coast city to the south .
Ensenada was supposed to get much of its water from the Colorado River , but the necessary pipeline was never built .
So the city receives its share indirectly , through a groundwater exchange with Tijuana , which does have a pipeline to the Colorado .
But Ensenada , like much of northern Mexico , has outgrown its allocation .
The city now draws water from other sources , including the deep wells that Badan and his neighbors say are draining the Guadalupe Valley ’s aquifer .
Even with those , about 20 % of the city ’s population of 413,000 does not receive water regularly , according to Rogelio Vasquez , a water expert who heads the department of applied geophysics at CICESE .
Vasquez and other experts believe it will take close to $ 1 billion to develop an adequate water supply by building a desalination plant , repairing and expanding pipelines , and capturing and recycling runoff .
In the meantime , he said , some people will continue to do without .
“ Crops will suffer , ” he said .
“ Costs will go up and tensions will rise . ”
Across the city , shiny black and blue barrels dot the rooftops of new housing developments , barrels in which residents store water for use when none is flowing through their faucets .
Often , the shutdowns last days .
In Lomas de la Presa , a middle - class neighborhood where some houses cost the equivalent of $ 40,000 , resident Raul Natzu said the water flows about four hours a day .
“ There ’s enough for essential uses , but no water for flowers or anything outside . ”
In ramshackle neighborhoods like Puesta del Sol , where people erect makeshift dwellings from plywood , cinder blocks and surplus garage doors , water does n’t flow at all .
Instead , residents buy what they can afford from roving trucks .
They store the water in rain barrels and dole it out as needed to bathe , flush toilets , and wash dishes and clothes .
Agustin Galindo , a 35 - year - old unemployed parking lot attendant , said that he , his wife and their three children have gone without water for as long as a week during periods of unemployment .
“ I do n’t have water because I ca n’t afford water , ” he said from his two - room house flanked by empty rain barrels .
At the present rate of consumption , Ensenada ’s demand for water will be double the supply by 2035 , according to Vasquez .
“ That assumes a steady state of supply , ” he said .
“ But the supply is n’t steady . ”
The water levels in municipal wells are dropping an average of 59 feet a year , he said .
Cross - border feud
There is still much bitterness between Mexico and the U.S. over Colorado River water , which was allotted grudgingly in 1944 , after the Mexican government threatened to cut off water vital to agriculture in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas .
That treaty gave Mexico about 10 % of the Colorado ’s estimated annual flow , about half of what Mexico wanted and not nearly enough to support the ensuing population boom .
Only a few hundred thousand people were living in northern Mexico at the time , compared with the 3 million there now .
Over time , Mexico came to believe it was entitled to the surplus flows , so when the U.S. announced its intention to capture most of the surplus , a coalition of growers and Mexican officials sued .
The U.S. Congress essentially mooted the case by exempting the water capture from all federal laws , including the National Environmental Policy Act , invoked by the plaintiffs .
Outraged Mexican officials accused the U.S. of stealing water from the poor to fuel the growth of fancy suburbs in San Diego and Las Vegas , where much of the water is destined to go .
“ The U.S. has contravened its obligations once again so that it can get more water flowing to its swimming pools and flower gardens , ” said Alberto Szekely , a career ambassador with the Mexican Foreign Service and an expert on cross - border environmental issues .
U.S. officials said they spent three years trying to work out a compromise that would allow Mexico to continue receiving some water from the All American Canal .
They said those efforts collapsed when Mexico filed suit .
Even the harshest critics of U.S. water policy acknowledge that Mexico bears some responsibility for the worsening water crisis .
Urban growth has outstripped pipelines that lose as much as 50 % of the water they carry , according to officials of Conagua , Mexico ’s national water commission .
“ There ’s no question Mexico has been delinquent in some respects , ” said Szekely .
Mexico also apportioned its share of the river to urban and rural users , leaving the delta with nothing .
The Cucapa , who have lived in northern Mexico longer than anyone , were not consulted .
Shortly after construction of Arizona ’s Glen Canyon Dam in 1963 , the delta dried up .
What once was North America ’s largest desert estuary , a marshland larger than Rhode Island , shriveled to 10 % of its original size , replaced by miles of salt - encrusted mud flats .
By the mid-1980s , two dozen species of fish were headed for extinction and 60 more were at risk .
A total collapse of the fishery was averted only by several years of high river flows , the result of heavy snowfall upstream in the Rocky Mountains .
In 1993 , the Mexican government , under pressure from environmentalists around the world , created a 3,000 - square - mile reserve , its boundaries extending from the delta well out into the Sea of Cortez .
Its nucleus at the mouth of the river was made off - limits to commercial fishing .
Jose Campoy , the director of the reserve , said the ban on fishing in the core , along with the periodic high flows down the river , is responsible for the resurgence of the corvina population .
But the ban does not deter everyone .
“ There have been a lot of fines .
But it is impossible to keep them away , ” he said of the Cucapa fishermen .
Last weekend , federal authorities seized about 9 tons of corvina allegedly caught out of season and in the protected zone by members of a Cucapa fishing cooperative .
“ It ’s a lousy situation , ” said Andres Lopez , a Cucapa fisherman .
“ But you gotta eat . ”
Those like us on the Vulture flying - car desk , who chafe at the limitations of present - day hovering aircraft , like to keep an eye on Sikorsky 's X2 prototype .
The helicopter firm announced today that the X2 made its first ground runs with blades fitted last week , and everything went swimmingly .
" We continue to move our experimental program closer and closer to first flight , " said Sikorsky chief James Kagdis .
" We anticipate that reaching this particular milestone , as with those yet to come , will continue to pique the interest of our military , commercial and international customers . "
X2 . Even more revolutionary than an Osprey .
The X2 is Sikorsky 's rival concept to the well - known V - 22 Osprey tiltrotor from Boeing , now coming into service with the US Marines and special - ops forces .
Both aircraft are intended to deal with two of the most pressing downsides of ordinary helicopters : limited speed , and limited range .
Helicopters ' speed is capped by two main factors .
As their blades spin backwards with respect to the forward motion of the copter , a point can be reached where the blade is briefly stationary with respect to the air it cleaves , which causes it to stop generating lift - obviously a bad thing .
Secondly , on the other side of the fuselage the blade tip which is going forward will start going supersonic well before the actual helicopter does , and this too causes serious issues .
If you speed up the rotors to avoid the retreating - blade stall , you bring on the sound barrier even quicker .
The tiltrotor deals with these by tipping its twin rotors forward to become propellors , and flying like an aeroplane .
But this simple - sounding idea is actually technical hell to implement , as the V - 22 programme has found over past couple of decades .
In particular , dealing with engine failures in helicopter mode is especially hard .
A normal twin - rotor chopper ( eg , the Chinook ) has its rotor assemblies linked , meaning that remaining power can be shared between them .
In the case of a total power loss , the bird can still " autorotate " down to land under control , dumping the energy which would normally smash it to bits on impact into spinning its rotors faster instead .
The V - 22 can do this , but it was n't easy to make it happen .
The complex , expensive Osprey may well be vulnerable to competing approaches .
Sikorsky think so , anyway .
They reckon to deal with the retreating - blade stall issue by using coaxial contrarotating rotor discs - thus far seen mainly in Russian designs - so that there are blades going forward on both sides of the craft at any given moment .
Then , as the advancing blade tips start to bump up against the sound barrier , the rotors will begin to spin more slowly - letting the X2 carry on accelerating .
Normally this would n't be easy , as a regular copter gets its forward poke as well as its lift from the rotor disc .
But the X2 , having twin main rotors , needs no sideways tail prop to keep it pointing in one direction in the hover .
Instead , it uses the tail for a pusher prop which can drive it forward .
Sikorsky reckon the X2 should be able to cruise easily at 250 knots , well in excess of a regular whirlybird 's 150 or so .
The Osprey can do this already , but Sikorsky reckon their bird could beat the V - 22 in other areas such as range , size , cost and maintenance effort .
One also notes that variable - rotor - revs tech like that of the X2 is quite rare , most whirlycraft spinning their blades at a fixed rate .
Boeing 's unmanned A160T uses variable - spin , and is said to be " four times quieter " in the hover than a regular copter - not to mention having advantages in fuel economy .
Whisper mode would , of course , be attractive to those who do n't care what colour their chopper is so long as it's black .
However , more prosaically , noise during takeoff and landing is one of the biggest obstacles to using helicopters in urban environments .
Noise was a major factor in killing off another excellent fast - but - hoverable aircraft concept tried out in the 1950s , the " Rotodyne " .
In this , a rotor disc is spun using " tip jets " rather than a normal engine and transmission .
Away from the pad , such a craft transitions to forward flight using thrust from ordinary turbofans or props , gradually taking more and more lift from stub wings and allowing the rotors to spin unpowered .
The Rotodyne is currently being looked at again under the name " Heliplane " , but is still struggling to deal with the horrendous racket generated by tip jets .
The X2 would seem to offer some prospect of being quieter in the hover than a normal chopper , not to mention an Osprey with a larger physical footprint - and it would surely make less row than a Rotodyne / Heliplane .
So Sikorsky 's new toy just might be the design which brings aerial buses into the city centre at long last , even if it does n't look much like a flying car . ®

Those facing hunger after the aid freeze include many children Aid agency Save the Children is pulling staff out of rural areas of Zimbabwe after Robert Mugabe 's government froze all aid agency field operations .
Other aid groups are also believed to be withdrawing personnel .
The ban on their work helping Zimbabwe 's poor has provoked international outrage .
The opposition has urged a strong foreign observer presence to combat intimidation during polls this month .
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai is not being allowed to campaign openly .
See map of food shortages in Zimbabwe His rallies were banned on Friday and another MP from his Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) party was arrested on Saturday .
President Mugabe is being accused of trying to steal the presidential run-off election even before it has begun , the BBC's Caroline Hawley reports from neighbouring South Africa .
Less then three weeks before the planned presidential run-off , the opposition says violence is escalating .
There are reports of increasing numbers of roadblocks cutting off parts of the countryside where , according to human rights workers , most of the abuses occur .
' Two million at risk '
Aid groups believe the government does not want them out in the rural areas witnessing what is happening or feeding the hungry when the government can use food to buy votes , our correspondent reports .
The government has accused aid agencies of campaigning for the opposition .
One aid worker told the BBC she had met opposition supporters who had had their ID cards taken away and their hands injured so they could not vote .
John Holmes , the United Nations ' emergency relief coordinator , has said the UN believes that two million people , particularly children , will be at greater risk as a result of the freeze on aid work .
Mr Mugabe is widely accused of economic mismanagement resulting in runaway inflation , soaring unemployment and the decline of Zimbabwe 's agricultural sector , although he blames a Western conspiracy for the country 's crisis .
With drought and failed harvests further reducing food supplies , aid agencies fear a rise in hunger .
Oxfam 's international programme director , Penny Lawrence , told the BBC the organisation had suspended its work at the government 's request .
" A lot of vulnerable people are very reliant on food aid and they do n't have anything else to eat , " she said on Saturday .
" Oxfam 's been supporting over 300,000 people over the last few months and ...
August is a real food shortage period .
MP re-arrested MP Eric Matinenga was arrested for the second time in two days , the MDC said .
Earlier charges of inciting violence had been dropped .
But the same charges were brought on Saturday , police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena was quoted by AFP news agency as saying .
A number of MDC members of parliament have been arrested since the first round of the presidential election on 29 March .
South Africa has increased the number of observers it is sending to Zimbabwe , Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad told the BBC .
He said he hoped the observer missions being sent by the South African Development Community and the African Union would also " be substantially increased in numbers " .

Today , exactly two years have passed since The Pirate Bay was raided by the Swedish police .
Unlike Hollywood would have wanted , the worlds largest BitTorrent tracker now more popular than ever , and they are here to stay .
The raid on the Pirate Bay took down the site , but not for long .
Within three days the site was back online , and much to the dislike of anti-piracy outfits , its traffic had doubled thanks to all the media attention .
At the time , the Swedish police confiscated 180 servers , most of which had nothing to do with The Pirate Bay .
Last December the investigation finally came to an end , resulting in 4,000 pages of legal paperwork .
Prosecutor HÃ¥kan Roswall later announced that four individuals involved with The Pirate Bay are being charged with “ assisting copyright infringement ” of 4 software applications , 9 films and 22 music tracks .
After the raid , it became clear that the US had threatened to put Sweden on WTO ’s black list if they refused to deal with the Pirate Bay problem .
Even the MPAA was involved , as John Malcolm , Executive Vice President of the MPAA wrote a letter to Sweden ’s State Secretary in which he stated , “ It is certainly not in Sweden ’s best interests to earn a reputation among other nations and trading partners as a place where utter lawlessness with respect to intellectual property rights is tolerated . ”
The users of the site do n’t have to worry that the site will be taken offline though , no matter what the court decides .
“ In case we lose the pending trial ( yeah right ) there will still not be any changes to the site .
The Pirate Bay will keep operating just as always .
We ’ve been here for years and we will be here many more , ” Sunde said earlier .
In a blog post , The Pirate Bay team now suggests to make May 31st a day of celebration for pirates : “ Let today be the pirates independence day !
Today we celebrate the victories we ’ve had and the victories that will come .
Today we celebrate that we ’re united in our efforts .
Keep on seeding ! ”
Happy Pirates independence day !

Microsoft said Tuesday it had dismissed chief information officer Stuart Scott for allegedly violating company policies .
Microsoft is remaining tight - lipped about the dismissal .
A spokesman for the Redmond , Wash . - based company said Scott was fired on Nov. 2 .
Scott 's biography on the Microsoft website said his employment at the company ended in early November .
After working at General Electric Co. for 17 years , Scott joined Microsoft in July 2005 as CIO and corporate vice - president .
He headed information technology at the company and reported to chief operating officer Kevin Turner .
Microsoft said general manager Shahla Aly and corporate vice - president Alain Crozier are taking over Scott 's duties until a replacement is hired .
Microsoft shares slipped 32 cents on Nasdaq , closing at $ 36.41 US .
Police asked supermarkets to challenge youths buying ketchup
Supermarkets have banned sales of eggs and tomato ketchup to young people in a bid to cut anti-social behaviour .
About a dozen residents in the Charles Close area of Caister - on - Sea , near Great Yarmouth , have reported tomato sauce being squirted at cars and homes .
Norfolk Police asked supermarkets in the town to challenge youths trying to buy sauces in squirty bottles or eggs .
Sgt Andy Brown said no more complaints had been received in the past two weeks since the agreement came into force .
' A bit daft '
Sgt Brown said squirting ketchup was not a criminal act but it could be possible to bring charges of criminal damage if paintwork was damaged on homes or vehicles .
He said : " We had about a dozen complaints from residents , some of them elderly , about people squirting ketchup over doors , windows and vehicles .
" One of the ways we have looked at tackling that is to speak to local schools and businesses to get them to agree to not sell tomato ketchup to young people .
" I know it sounds a bit daft , but it has made a difference because we have had no more reported incidents since the supermarkets came on board with this . "
Martin Bailie , from Lidl supermarkets , said staff from its Caister branch became aware of a problem before police asked them for help .
" Our staff were challenging youngsters who were trying to bulk buy these things .
" It is anti-social behaviour and it was getting out of hand .
" It was n't that we have n't been selling eggs and ketchup to youths , but have been careful about who we have sold them to , and we are glad it has been making a difference . "

It 's no longer a secret how five loaves and two fish managed to feed the five thousand - especially if the sea- dwelling delicacies in question were as big as this mammoth fish .
More likely to eat than be eaten , this giant whale shark was caught off the coast of China by hardcore fishermen who managed to harness the ten - metre , eight - tonne whopper .
Whale sharks are the world 's largest living fish , it is estimated that they can reach an 18 metre length .
They live in warm water along the coast and open seas and spend most of their time near the surface .
The prize whale shark 's hefty load took over an hour to be hoisted in an industrial crane back on to dry land , where it was sliced into relatively smaller pieces for fish - lovers everywhere to enjoy .
The games industry is always on the look - out for new , talented engineers and programmers who understand how the hardware works under the hood .
However , it is n’t possible to buy a PlayStation development kit at your local computer store and development for the PlayStation has remained a mystery , even to very interested individuals .
It gives me great pleasure to unveil the mystery and announce the PlayStation - edu program !
We expect this program to be a great tool to teach students about the PlayStation platforms .
PlayStation - edu is a program for universities and colleges to get access to PS2 and PSP development kits … the same ones that professional developers use to make the games you love to play .
You get the development software , the hardware , and the SDK to learn and experiment with .
SCEA wants to make sure that students who are graduating from college are ready to program on PlayStation hardware and that means getting it into your hands .
PlayStation - edu is not a general game creation program ( sorry artists and designers ) .
It is for computer science and engineering students who want to understand how the hardware works in the PlayStation consoles .
Schools which teach game programming or computer architecture can use the development kits in their classes .
Participants will get demo code and samples , as well as documentation about how things work .
We want the dev kits used in the classroom !
Students in PlayStation - edu will have access to our support web site where they can talk with other students in the program on our forums .
Of course , there are a couple caveats ( are n’t there always ? ) :
Yes , your school will need to sign some legal agreements with us and yes , “ get access to ” means that your school will need to purchase the hardware .
For more information and application information , educators may contact me ( Mark Danks ) at applications@psp-edu.scedev.net .
Only requests for applications from qualified school representatives will be responded to , so any students reading this should have their teacher submit the request .
Also , this is only for universities and colleges , so high school students will need to wait a few years .
We are looking forward to hearing from you and seeing what you can create !
But as people concluded that high energy prices were here to stay , " this is now one of those big changes in our lives that requires nothing short of dramatic lifestyle changes , " he said .
BEAVERTON , Oregon ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama turned his focus to a U.S. general election showdown with John McCain on Friday and said the Republican White House candidate would continue the “ failed policies ” of President George W. Bush .
Obama gathered momentum in his battle with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination with endorsements from seven more senior party figures and a labor union , as well as strong praise from former Democratic rival John Edwards .
“ Let ’s assume Barack is the nominee , because it ’s certainly headed in that direction , ” Edwards told NBC ’s “ Today ” show .
He said Obama could unify the party and had a better chance than Clinton of winning November ’s election against McCain .
Obama , an Illinois senator , largely ignored Clinton during his first campaign stop since taking a commanding lead in the Democratic race on Tuesday by winning a primary election in North Carolina and narrowly losing Indiana .
But he took direct aim at McCain , saying he had fundamental differences with the Arizona senator on issues like the Iraq war , taxes , gasoline prices and health care .
“ John McCain wants to continue George Bush ’s war in Iraq , losing thousands of lives and spending tens of billions of dollars a month to fight a war that is n’t making us safe , ” Obama said in Beaverton , Oregon .
“ Senator McCain is running for president to double down on George Bush ’s failed policies .
I am running to change them and that is what will be the fundamental difference in this election when I am the Democratic nominee for president . ”
NUMBERS GAME
Obama picked up seven more “ superdelegates ” -- the group of nearly 800 party leaders and elected officials not bound by the state - by - state contests who are free to back any candidate at the Democratic nominating convention in August .
He was also endorsed by the American Federation of Government Employees , representing 600,000 federal workers .
Clinton , a New York senator and wife of former President Bill Clinton , won another superdelegate endorsement from Rep. Chris Carney of Pennsylvania .
“ I ’m gratified that we ’ve got some superdelegates that are coming our way , ” Obama said during a lunch stop at a taco restaurant in Woodburn , Oregon .
“ And I think we ’ve got a strong case to make that I will be a nominee that can pull the party together and take on John McCain in the fall . ”
He beamed as people in the taco shop broke into chants of “ Viva Obama ” and “ Si se puede ” -- “ Yes he can ” in Spanish .
Obama has now earned 13 superdelegate endorsements since Tuesday ’s contests , moving closer to winning the nomination .
Superdelegate support has become critical as neither candidate can clinch the nomination without them .
Among those backing Obama on Friday were Reps. Donald Payne of New Jersey , a former Clinton supporter , and Peter DeFazio of Oregon .
“ At this point , Barack is the presumptive nominee , ” Rep. Rahm Emanuel of Illinois , who has not endorsed anyone in the race , said at a conference in New York .
“ Hillary ca n’t win but something could happen that Barack could lose the nomination . ”
With just 217 pledged delegates at stake in the final six primary contests , Clinton has no realistic chance of overtaking Obama ’s lead in pledged delegates won in the state - by - state battles that began in January .

Obama ’s campaign believes he will clinch a majority of those 217 delegates when Oregon and Kentucky vote on May 20 .
CLINTON FOR VICE PRESIDENT ?
Throughout the day , Obama found himself answering questions about whether he would pick Clinton as his vice presidential running mate or would consider helping pay off some of his rival ’s campaign debt .
Clinton has vowed to continue running until the voting concludes on June 3 , but she and campaign aides have hinted she will step aside if it is clear that Obama will be the nominee .
An MSNBC count gives Obama 1,850 delegates to Clinton ’s 1,700 -- leaving him about 175 short of the 2,025 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination .
More than 250 superdelegates remain undecided .
At an appearance in Portland , Oregon , Clinton criticized Obama ’s health care plan for potentially leaving 15 million Americans uninsured .
The United States has an estimated 47 million uninsured now .
“ This is a huge difference , ” Clinton said , calling health care reform “ the unfinished business of our country that we have to resolve . ”
Clinton ’s plan would require insurance for all Americans ; Obama ’s plan requires it only for children .
Clinton argues that she has a better chance to beat McCain in November , particularly given Obama ’s difficulty in winning over white working - class voters in key battleground states .
Sixteen members of Congress and Clinton backers from states that will be critical in November ’s election published a letter on Friday supporting her argument she would be the strongest candidate to lead the party in swing districts like theirs .

Make America Think Again ! - Share Pat's Columns ...
by Patrick J. Buchanan
Europe , the Mother Continent of Western Man , is today aging and dying , unable to sustain the birth rates needed to keep her alive , or to resist conquest by an immigrant invasion from the Third World .
What happened to the nations that only a century ago ruled the world ?
In “ Churchill , Hitler and ‘ The Unnecessary War ’ : How Britain Lost Its Empire and the West Lost the World , ” published today , this writer will argue that it was colossal blunders of British statesmen , Winston Churchill foremost among them , that turned two European wars into world wars that may yet prove the mortal wounds of the West .
The first blunder was a secret decision of the inner Cabinet in 1906 to send a British army across the Channel to fight in any Franco - German War .
Had the Kaiser known the British Empire would fight for France , he would have moved more decisively than he did to halt the plunge to war in July 1914 .
Had Britain not declared war on Aug. 4 and brought in Japan , Italy and the United States , the war would have ended far sooner .
Leninism and Stalinism would never have triumphed in Russia , and Hitler would never have come to power in Germany .
The second blunder was the vengeful Treaty of Versailles that added a million square miles to the British Empire while putting millions of Germans under Czech and Polish rule in violation of the terms of the armistice and Woodrow Wilson ’s 14 Points .
A third was the British decision to capitulate to U.S. demands in 1921 and throw over a faithful Japanese ally of 20 years .
Tokyo took its revenge , 20 years later , by inflicting the greatest defeat in British history , the surrender of Singapore and an army of 80,000 to a Japanese army half that size .
A fourth British blunder , which Neville Chamberlain called the “ very midsummer of madness , ” was the 1935 decision to sanction Italy for a colonial war in Ethiopia .
London destroyed the Stresa Front of Britain , France and Italy that Mussolini had forged to contain Germany , and drove Mussolini straight into the arms of a Nazi dictator he loathed .
In 1936 , France sounded out the British to determine if they would support a drive to push German troops out of the Rhineland that Hitler had occupied in violation of Versailles .
The British refused .
And Churchill congratulated France for taking the matter up with the League of Nations , and said the ideal solution would be a voluntary Nazi withdrawal from the Rhineland to show the world that Hitler respected the sanctity of treaties .
Munich , 70 years ago this September , was a disaster .
But it was a direct , if not inevitable , consequence of a Versailles treaty that had consigned 3.5 million Sudeten Germans to Czech rule against their will and in violation of the principle of self - determination .
But the fatal blunder was not Munich .
It was the decision of March 31 , 1939 , to hand a war guarantee to a neo - fascist regime of Polish colonels who had joined Hitler in the rape of Czechoslovakia .
Britain gave Warsaw a blank check to take her to war over a town , Danzig , the British themselves thought should be restored to Germany .
Result : a Hitler - Stalin Pact and a six - year war that left scores of millions dead , Europe in ruins , the British empire bankrupt and breaking , 10 European nations under the barbaric rule of Joseph Stalin and half a century of Cold War .
Had there been no war guarantee to Poland , there might have been no war , no Nazi invasion of Western Europe and no Holocaust .
Churchill was the indispensable war leader who held on until Hitler committed his fatal blunders , invading Russia and declaring war on America .
He was also the man most responsible for Britain ‘s fall from mistress of the greatest empire since Rome to an island dependency of the United States .
About the character of the Bolshevik regime in 1919 and Nazi regime in 1933 , Churchill had been right .
About British rearmament , he had been right .
But Churchill was also often disastrously wrong .
He led the West down a moral incline to its own barbarism by imposing a starvation blockade on Germany in 1914 and launching air terror against open cities in 1940 .
These policies brought death to hundreds of thousands of women and children .
He was behind the greatest British military blunders in two wars : the Dardanelles disaster of 1915 and the Norwegian fiasco of 1940 that brought down Chamberlain and vaulted Churchill to power .
While excoriating Chamberlain for appeasing Hitler , Churchill ’s own appeasement of Stalin lasted longer and was even more egregious and costly , ensuring that the causes for which Britain sacrificed the empire — the freedom of Poland and preventing a hostile power from dominating Europe — were lost .
Churchill was , however , surely right when he told FDR in their first meeting after Pearl Harbor that they should call the war they were now in “ The Unnecessary War . ”
He was a Great Man — at the cost of his country ’s greatness .
Eighty - one page justification of torture
After years of litigation , the infamous Department of Justice ( DOJ ) “ torture memo ” has been made public by the Bush regime .
The 81 - page memo , written by John Yoo , then a deputy at the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) , was sent to the Defense Department ’s top lawyer , William J. Haynes , in March 14 , 2003 .
This memo asserted that the President has unlimited power to order brutal interrogations to extract information from detainees .
According to Yoo , " [ O ] ur previous opinions make clear that customary international law is not federal law and that the president is free to override it at his discretion . "
Under the Bush regime , international law prohibiting torture was ignored .
Thousands of prisoners have been and continue to be routinely abused and tortured in U.S. run prisons around the world .
This memo was used to legally “ justify ” these crimes .
Memo released because of FOIA lawsuit
The memo was declassified on April 1st as a result of an American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) Freedom of Information Act lawsuit .
According to ACLU staff attorney Amrit Singh , " [ S]enior officials at the Justice Department gave the Pentagon the green light to torture prisoners .
It is outrageous that none of these high - level officials have been brought to task yet for their role in authorizing prisoner abuse . "
This memo was not an aberration .
Another OLC memo asserting the same kind of unchecked executive authority was sent to the CIA in August 2002 .
In that now - notorious document , torture was defined so narrowly that it encompassed only those methods that result in pain akin to that associated with " death , organ failure or the permanent impairment of a significant body function . "
All other methods of “ harsh interrogation ” were not considered to be torture .
Expansion of Executive Power
The just - released memo parrots the advice previously given to the CIA .
But the 2003 memo goes even further in its assertion of expansive presidential powers .
It claims that during wartime , the president 's Commander - in - Chief power overrides the due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment and other Constitutional rights and protections .
" The memo shows that the same disgraceful legal analysis that was at the root of the CIA 's illegal interrogation program was also at the root of the Defense Department 's program , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" The memo takes an extremely broad view of the president 's power as Commander - in - Chief .
If you believe this memo , there is no limit at all to the kinds of interrogation methods the President can authorize . "
Jaffer stated
Yoo 's rationale puts " literally no limit at all to the kinds of interrogation methods that the president can authorize .
The whole point of the memo is obviously to nullify every possible legal restraint on the president 's wartime authority .
The memo was meant to allow torture , and that 's exactly what it did . "
Immunity for torture ?
In the memo , John Yoo writes : " If a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition , he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda terrorist network .
In that case , we believe that he could argue that the executive branch 's constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions . "
In other words
Yoo argues torturers have immunity from prosecution for torture as long the President says it is necessary to protect national security .
Yoo further concludes that foreign enemy combatants held overseas are not protected from cruel and unusual punishment supposedly guaranteed by the Constitution .
Yoo , in his expansive view of executive power , dismisses the role of Congress saying that it " cannot interfere with the president 's exercise of his authority as commander - in - chief to control the conduct of operations during a war . "
But during the Bush regime , Congress has generally gone along with Bush .
It has “ legalized ” many of the regime ’s illegal acts , from massive spying programs to unleashing aggressive wars .
It has funded these wars which have resulted in the capture of tens of thousands of “ enemy combatants . ”
The Yoo memo reveals the development of interrogation methods for use at Guantánamo Bay and other hellholes run by the Bush regime .
In a recently published book , “ Administration of Torture , ” ACLU attorneys Jaffer and Singh reveal that a Defense Department working group convened by then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was given the March 2003
Yoo memo and told that it should regard the memo as " definitive guidance . "
Relying on the Yoo memo , the working group ultimately endorsed “ harsh interrogation methods , ” which violated U.S. and international law .
Rumsfeld relied on the working group memo to authorize a new interrogation directive for use at Guantánamo Bay .
General Geoffrey Miller , who was in charge of Guantánamo , was later sent to Iraq to encourage the adoption of torture methods there , including at Abu Ghraib prison .
The released memo confirms that the justification of torture practiced by the regime goes to the very top of the regime .
But as “ our leaders ” in Congress have made clear they will not hold anyone in the regime accountable .
And even though the regime claims that this memo is no longer operative , torture continues .
More than 50,000 prisoners of the so - called “ war on terror ” are currently held by the U.S. or its allies .
Prisoners face torture , rape , and death in these hellholes .
What will you do to halt these crimes against humanity ?

REUTERS / Chip East
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. companies ’ planned layoffs jumped 68 percent in April from the prior month to the highest since September 2006 , pointing to further deterioration in the labor market , a report showed on Thursday .
Planned job cuts in U.S. companies totaled 90,015 last month , up from 53,579 in March and up 27 percent from a year earlier , employment consulting firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas Inc. reported .
The April layoffs were the steepest since the 100,315 cuts announced in September 2006 .
Most of the announced job cuts came from the financial sector , due to the housing slump and about $ 300 billion in write - downs on bad mortgages and investments , the firm said .
The financial services industry announced 23,106 cuts in April with almost half of them occurring in a two - day period that saw hefty planned layoffs from Citigroup and Merrill Lynch , it said .
The telecommunications sector was second in announced layoffs in April with 8,007 , followed closely by 7,954 planned cuts in the transportation industry .
Employers have announced 290,671 jobs to be eliminated in the first four months of 2008 , up 9 percent from the 266,658 cuts recorded during the same span in 2007 , the firm said .
Going forward , the fallout from record oil prices may result in more layoffs than the housing slump , John A. Challenger , chief executive officer of Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
“ The impact of high gasoline prices is rippling through the economy much faster than the housing collapse ever did or will , ” Challenger said in a statement .
CLEVELAND -- At 2:59 p.m. , one minute before the deadline expired , Cavaliers general manager Danny Ferry called NBA officials in New York to say he was making a major trade .
Two , actually .
They must have been surprised .
Ferry was dismantling his team .
In a complex , 11 - player swap involving Cleveland , Chicago and Seattle , Ferry dealt half his active roster to acquire center Ben Wallace and forward Joe Smith from the Bulls , and forward Wally Szczerbiak and guard Delonte West from the SuperSonics .
LeBron James wanted help to win an NBA title .
Ferry got it for him .
" I did n't think we were good enough to win the championship , " Ferry said , explaining his motives for the move .
" I thought we had a very good team .
But I do believe if we have a chance to make ourselves better we should try .
" Was it a risk in doing so ?
Yes , it was a risk .
But we 're going to have to make some decisions that have some risk in them if we want to continue to build and grow . "
Unable to finalize major deals in the past , Ferry pulled off a colossal one at the 3 p.m. buzzer .
He sent guard Larry Hughes , forwards Drew Gooden and Cedric Simmons , and guard Shannon Brown to Chicago for Wallace , one of the game 's top inside enforcers , and Smith , a versatile veteran .
Foreign observers invited into the Tibetan capital , Lhasa , reported a city badly scarred by days of unrest and a heavy Chinese security presence still highly visible on the streets .
Operating under strictly controlled conditions , a group of 26 international reporters was driven into the city yesterday by the Chinese government as part of an effort to convince the outside world that life there is returning to normal and that Beijing is back in control after facing its most sustained opposition for 20 years .
It was the first time that foreign observers had been allowed in since fierce rioting in protest at Beijing rule left dozens of people dead in Tibet and neighbouring Chinese provinces .

As President George Bush expressed his concern at the military reaction to the protests in a telephone call to the Chinese President , Hu Jintao , increasing the international pressure over human rights in the approach to this summer 's Olympic Games , the observers described a city still under siege with heavily armed police in camouflage uniforms stationed outside government buildings and officers patrolling every intersection .
It is more than two weeks since the height of the violence and the Chinese military crackdown in which anti-government campaigners say up to 140 Tibetans died .
The unrest prompted Beijing to deploy thousands of troops to the region and order a news blackout on the country 's interior .
China puts the death toll at 19 .
The journalists were flown to the city and taken on a bus tour .
Police questioned by reporters said they were carrying out routine vehicle checks for fake licence plates and people travelling without seatbelts .
There were signs of every day life returning .
The Potala Palace , the traditional seat of Tibetan power , was re-opened yesterday for the first time since 14 March , while in nearby Potala Square reporters spoke to locals who said that although security continued to be tight , they were allowed to move around the city .
Lhasa also bore scars from the rioting .
Just a few blocks from Potala many shops thought to be owned by ethnic Chinese were burnt out .
Others , festooned with white ceremonial scarves to signify their owners were Tibetan , remained untouched .
On Qingnian Road , a red banner bearing one of President Hu's favourite slogans – Construct a Harmonious Society – remained intact but a two - storey medical clinic on the same road had been destroyed .
The Dalai Lama , who Chinese authorities blame for orchestrating the protests , described yesterday 's visit as a " first step " , saying he hoped journalists would be allowed to operate " with complete freedom " .
He added : " Then you can access the real situation . "
The White House said that Mr Bush encouraged Mr Hu to engage in " substantive dialogue " with the exiled opposition leader 's representatives and to allow the media and diplomats free access to protest areas .
Earlier Chinese state media announced the surrender of more than 600 people who took part in the protests in Lhasa and in Aba county in Sichuan province , home to ethnic Tibetans .
But Beijing appeared to have failed to quell the insurrection completely , with reports from the western province of Qinghai of hundreds of civilians staging a sit - down protest after police stopped a march .
Paramilitary forces dispersed between 200 and 300 protesters and ordered people to stay inside .
One source told Reuters : " They were beating up monks , which will only infuriate ordinary people . "
The violence has prompted growing international condemnation .
The head of the European Parliament , Hans - Gert Pöttering , issued an invitation yesterday to the Dalai Lama to address MEPs and paved the way for a vote on a possible partial boycott of the Olympics .

VANCOUVER–Taser
International rushed its product to market with faulty safety and medical research , claims the head of a company that plans to market a device to compete with the Taser .
Ken Stethem , founder and chairman of Ageis Industries , told a public inquiry into Taser use that Taser International 's methodology was flawed in designing , developing and deploying the conducted energy weapons .
Normally a company would develop medical and safety data , then test the product on animals and humans , Stethem told the inquiry , launched after the public video of the minutes before Robert Dziekanski's death was aired world - wide .
It showed the Polish immigrant creating a disturbance last October at the arrivals area of the Vancouver airport and being twice shocked by an RCMP Taser .
" In my humble opinion that 's not how the current CEWs were developed and deployed .
And that 's why we 're having problems today .
Stethem disputed several claims made by Taser on medical evidence and safety connected to the device .
He pointed to Taser 's patent information that says the device puts out between 100 and 500 milliamps of electricity .
Medical experts say it only takes about 100 milliamps to cause the heart to go into a fatal rhythm , Stethem told the inquiry .
He said medical studies say low voltage electrocutions can happen without any visible evidence of injury .
" Now the burden of proof has been shifted to the public that these are n't safe , instead of law enforcement and manufacturers that they are , " Stethem told the inquiry .
Stethem 's company designs intermediate force options , similar to a conducted energy weapon , in a baton that incapacitates muscles via an electrical output .
" I 'm not here to bang Taser International or anybody else , " he told commissioner Thomas Braidwood .
" I 'm here to report what we 've learned through our research . "
A heart - rhythm expert also told the inquiry there are real risks to Taser use , despite the company 's safety claims .
" Just because somebody collapses of sudden death minutes later after a Taser application does n't mean that the two are not connected , " said Dr. Zian Tseng , a San Francisco cardiologist and electrophysiologist .
Tseng said any normal , healthy person could die from a jolt of the conducted energy weapon if the shock was given in the right area of the chest and during the vulnerable point in the beating of the heart .
He stressed the risk of death is far greater if there is adrenaline or illicit drugs coursing through the body or if the person has a history of heart or other medical issues .
Tseng said there needs to be much more real - world studies on the use of the weapon , instead of using police officers – often large , healthy males – to test the device .
He also said medical examiners should be given more freedom to investigate such deaths .
" If there 's a person that dropped dead suddenly after Taser application and you can find nothing else on the autopsy , I would venture to say that 's due to arrhythmic death . "
The risk to suspects being shocked could almost be zero to the heart if police avoided using the weapon in the chest area , and Tseng suggested that be one of Braidwood 's recommendations .
Lebanon ’s long - simmering political crisis lurched deeper into violent civil conflict Thursday as bands of Shiite and Sunni gunmen battled in the streets for a second day and politicians took to the airwaves to denounce each other for pushing the country toward war .
Explosions and bursts of gunfire rattled central Beirut as groups allied with the Hezbollah - led opposition and the United States - backed government fired machine guns , assault rifles and grenade launchers at each other and into the air , apparently in shows of strength .
The deep thuds of occasional mortar fire shook the ground as night fell .
Throughout the day , panicked civilians scurried for cover or loaded up on basic supplies , emptying supermarket shelves of frozen meats .
Gunmen had blocked roads to the country ’s only international airport as well as the main highways to Damascus , the Syrian capital , and to southern Lebanon , in effect placing the capital under siege .
Lebanese news sources said at least four people were killed in fighting Thursday and a female bystander died of injuries sustained in the previous day ’s clashes .
But information was scant as paramedics and security officials avoided entering areas of intense fighting that witnesses said resembled the level of the civil war that engulfed the country from 1975 to 1990 .

By late night , government allies were calling for “ dialogue ” with the Shiite group Hezbollah , even as fighting continued and allegations mounted that its militiamen were raiding homes and offices of government supporters .
“ We are trapped in our homes , ” one Sunni militiaman aligned with the pro-government Future movement said Thursday night , speaking by telephone from his central Beirut home .
He spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ They shot at my building and at my car .
We are trying to call the army to protect us and hoping we wo n’t be taken from our homes but they will know sooner or later where we live . ”
The violence comes amid heightened regional tensions between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia , which strongly back the government , and Iran and Syria , which support Hezbollah and the opposition .
In Lebanon , as well as the Palestinian territories and Iraq , the U.S. has begun increasing pressure on Iranian allies .
U.S. officials blamed Hezbollah for the unrest in Lebanon .

“ Hezbollah needs to make a choice :
Be a terrorist organization or be a political party , but quit trying to be both , ” U.S. national security council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Thursday .
“ They need to stop their disruptive activities now . ”
Tensions escalated Tuesday after the government voted to outlaw Hezbollah ’s communications network , which the group was allegedly expanding , and sack the Hezbollah - allied head of security at the international airport , who had allegedly begun harassing visitors believed to have political ties to the government .
The fiercest battles broke out after a televised speech Thursday afternoon by Hezbollah ’s chief , Sheik Hassan Nasrallah .
He said the Cabinet ’s decision to declare the group ’s fiber - optic system illegal was tantamount to a declaration of war and put the government squarely in the camp of Hezbollah ’s enemies , Israel and the United States , which consider it a terrorist organization .

“ This decision is first of all a declaration of war and the launching of war by the government . . . against the resistance and its weapons for the benefit of America and Israel , ” Nasrallah told reporters via teleconference .
“ The communications network is the significant part of the weapons of the resistance , ” said Nasrallah .
“ I had said that we will cut the hand that targets the weapons of the resistance .
. . .
Today is the day to fulfill this decision . ”
The celebratory gunfire that punctuates the end of political speeches here escalated into armed confrontations and sustained gunfire that continued past midnight .
Saad Hariri , leader of Lebanon ’s Sunni community and head of the parliamentary majority , appeared on television saying the government would ask the army to enforce the decision to uproot the telecommunications network and remove the head of airport security .
Advertisement
“ You say you do n’t want Sunni - Shiite strife and we do n’t want this to happen either , ” he said .
An analyst called the proposal a “ small retreat ” by Hariri ’s camp , because the Lebanese army lacks the strength or unity to confront Hezbollah or any other of the country ’s major political groups .
The army also coordinates closely with Hezbollah on security matters and has affirmed its support for “ resistance ” to Israel , which has repeatedly invaded and occupied Lebanon over the last several decades .
Supported by Iran and Syria , Hezbollah operates as a state within a state , with strongholds in southern and western Lebanon and Beirut ’s southern suburbs .
Its armed wing fought Israel to a standstill in the summer of 2006 .
Hezbollah claimed victory in that conflict , but the war upset Lebanon ’s fragile sectarian balance and precipitated a political crisis that has left the country without a president since November .
Government supporters said they were angered by what they considered Hezbollah ’s attempts to exploit the crisis to expand its domestic surveillance and communications abilities , as well as its armed capacity .

“ Hezbollah is launching a gradual coup against the state of Lebanon , ” said Walid Jumblatt , leader of Lebanon ’s Druze community and a staunch government supporter .

Burma is still exporting rice even as it tries to curb the influx of international donations of food bound for the starving survivors of the cyclone that killed up to 116,000 people .
Sacks of rice destined for Bangladesh were being loaded on to a ship at the Thilawa container port at the mouth of the Yangon River at the end of last week , even though Burma 's ' rice bowl ' region was devastated by the deadly storm a week ago .
The Burmese regime , which has a monopoly on the country 's rice exports , said it planned to meet all its contractual commitments .
With rice prices hitting a record high after more than doubling since January , the exports are a valuable source of foreign revenue for the junta and its allies .
The fear is that with the rice - growing area in the Irrawaddy delta inundated with salt water from the huge tidal wave , Burma may need to import greater amounts of rice this year .
Alarm at the prospect fuelled another spurt in rice prices during the week .
The continuing rice sales looked like just another facet of the Burmese regime 's insensitivity to the suffering of its own people as it continues to block international relief to cyclone victims and pressed ahead with the constitutional referendum yesterday .
The Burmese leader , General Than Shwe , has urged people to vote ' yes ' .
Critics claim the referendum is designed to cement the generals ' hold on power as it reserves 25 per cent of the seats in parliament for the military .
They say it should have been postponed because of the disaster .
Many of the cyclone 's victims have received little aid .
International relief from the UN and other agencies has been blocked , and disaster management experts barred from entering even though there has been little evidence that the Burmese military is alleviating the suffering .
A spokesman for the World Food Programme ( WFP ) said two planes containing humanitarian supplies had ' not been released ' by the Burmese authorities after arriving in Rangoon airport yesterday .
The planes contained ' critically needed supplies and equipment ' provided by the WFP , UNHCR and other aid organisations .
While the sacks of rice for export were being loaded on to the freighter at Thilawa last Friday , cyclone survivors from surrounding villages said they had received only hand - outs of spoiled rice from the port 's warehouse , where the storm had soaked 40 per cent of the stored rice .
The cyclone , which hit Thilawa early on Saturday morning , blasted the port so severely that one of the three enormous container cranes toppled and was left crippled .
In the nearby village of Thamalone , just 15 miles from Rangoon , the only aid has come from the Free Family Funeral Association which usually provides coffins for poor families but used its trucks to deliver rice to villagers .
To mark the end of drinking on the London Underground , revellers organised last - night parties .
The night began light - hearted but ended in 17 arrests and the closure of six stations

TOKYO ( Reuters ) -
One of the travelers who arrived at Tokyo ’s Narita airport over the weekend may have picked up an unusual souvenir from customs -- a package of cannabis .
A customs official hid the package in a suitcase belonging to a passenger arriving from Hong Kong as a training exercise for sniffer dogs Sunday , but lost track of both drugs and suitcase during the practice session , a spokeswoman for Tokyo customs said .
Customs regulations specify that a training suitcase be used for such exercises , but the official said he had used passengers ’ suitcases for similar purposes in the past , domestic media reported .

BBC News , Lancaster County , Pennsylvania
Lancaster County , Pennsylvania , should be McCain country .
Rev Hagee 's ( L ) endorsement later proved embarrassing for Mr McCain About 70 % of its residents are registered Republicans , and George W Bush won two - thirds of the votes here in 2004 .
But speaking to concert - goers at the Witness Christian Rock Festival , which was held in the county last weekend , you get a very vivid sense of the hurdles John McCain faces .
Many of the people there describe themselves as Evangelical Christians , part of a core Republican constituency , which was successfully mobilised by the Bush campaign four years ago .
But when you ask whether this year 's presumptive Republican nominee has their support , few give a clear answer .
" The easy thing for a conservative would be to vote Republican , and I 've always voted that way , " says Scott , a man in his thirties , with a bare chest and prominent crucifix .
" But this is n't an easy election .
I 'm bothered by a lot of what people I trust have told me about John McCain . "
Shifting alliance
This mistrust of John McCain has its roots in his uneasy relationship with evangelical leaders .
In its most famous manifestation , he referred to televangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as " agents of intolerance " during his 2000 run for the White House .
That helped to cement the Arizona senator 's reputation as an independent voice , but , as he prepared to run in 2008 , he began to change his tune .
In 2006 , he gave the commencement speech at the late Reverend Falwell 's Liberty University in Virginia and in 2007 , he referred to the United States as a " Christian nation " .
[ Evangelical Christians would ] rather have a third - rate fireman than a first - class arsonist
Dr Richard Land
President , Southern Baptist Convention 's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission
And this year - with the election campaign in full swing - he touted the endorsements of televangelist John Hagee and prominent Ohio pastor Rod Parsley .
But this brought problems .
Even as his Democratic opponent , Barack Obama , was being forced onto the defensive by the fiery sermons of his former , long - time pastor , Jeremiah Wright , John McCain had his own explaining to do .
John Hagee , who was known to have made offensive comments about Roman Catholics had also - it emerged - referred to the Holocaust as " God 's will " , while Rod Parsley had called Islam " an anti-Christ religion that intends through violence to conquer the world " .
Under pressure , the presumptive Republican nominee repudiated both endorsements .
Stumble According to Jacques Berlinerblau , Professor of Jewish Civilisation at Georgetown University and writer on the role of religion in presidential politics , the whole episode showed that Mr McCain 's advisors had a tin ear for religion .
" The McCain team went after these endorsements apparently not knowing who these people were , but also - more importantly - overestimating their ability to bring in the votes , " he says .
" And they completely lost their major trump card : Senator Obama 's association with Reverend Wright , which upset many blue - collar , white voters , who Senator McCain needs to win this election . "
A stumble , then , but perhaps not a fatal one .
Although evangelical leaders have still not embraced John McCain , he is far closer to them on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage than Mr Obama .
Mr Obama could win more evangelical voters than previous Democrats did This is how Dr Richard Land , President of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention puts it : " What I 've heard over and over again from social conservatives , Southern Baptists - pastors and non-pastors - is ' John McCain was n't my first choice .
In some cases he was n't my second or even third choice .
But I 'd rather have a third - rate fireman than a first - class arsonist ' .
And they look upon Barack Obama as a first - class arsonist when it comes to the issues that matter to them . "
But those issues - and priorities - seem to be changing .
Balancing act
At the Witness Festival in Pennsylvania , for example , huge posters showing a starving African child dominated the grounds , vividly illustrating the extent to which issues such as poverty and global warming have risen up the agenda of younger evangelicals .
And the Obama camp is hoping that this will help them prise these voters away from John McCain .
They are relying both on their candidate 's comfortable use of religious rhetoric and the efforts of their well - developed Christian outreach team , created , in part , to counter one of the Democrats ' long - standing problems - talking about religion .
Although , in a sign of the extra challenges faced by Senator Obama , part of their work has been to counter the widespread rumours that he is a Muslim .
At the moment , though , the Obama team seems confident that it is making inroads into this core Republican constituency , while remaining wary of the predictions from some quarters that their candidate could win as much as 40 % of the evangelical vote in November .
An unlikely figure , perhaps , but food for thought for the McCain campaign , as it tries to balance appealing to those prized independent voters , with shoring up the support of the Republican base .
Even at this early stage of the general election campaign , it is proving to be a tough balancing act .

What are these ?
By Jim Baxter , NMA President
The recent elections in Great Britain have been touted as a reaction to a slowing economy , declining housing values , and rising jobless rates .
Of particular note was the sacking of the high profile mayor of London , Ken Livingstone .
Mr. Livingstone has been the darling of the new urbanists , for his aggressive surveillance and taxing policies aimed at motorists .
But why bounce Mr. Livingstone out of office for economic policy issues for which he has no control over ?
Could it be that the ex-mayor achieved his “ ex ” status for zealous anti-driver policies and the havoc they caused ?
Could it also be that in the rest of the country that voters have had their fill of a surveillance society that uses photo enforcement and monitoring ( over 6000 ticket cameras ) to bleed its citizens under the pretense of “ highway safety ? ”
The ticket cameras are a daily plague that remind every citizen that national and local governments are determined to control and tax their every movement .
Does it not seem instructive that a normally civil and restrained population renowned for order and compliance is burning , shooting , smashing and driving over government installed ticket cameras ?
The overwhelming majority of the voting public has not suffered job losses and their home values are not a paramount concern , unless they are in the process of selling .
But every day they run the gauntlet of surveillance and ticket cameras , cameras that are installed for the devoted purposes of intrusive control and revenue generation .
Might this be the real reason Mr. Livingstone and his cohorts in the Labor party are now among the unemployed ?

In February , the largest beef recall in history capped weeks of speculation about sick cows , then prompted many to wonder where all that meat went off to .
Nice to see Emacs getting a bit of press recently .
I ’ve used it for almost 20 years now and it dominates my time at the keyboard .
It is n’t perfect and I ’m reluctant to recommend it but I would n’t want to be without it .
Let me explain .
The best thing about Emacs is that it can do everything ( including the things it ca n’t do yet ) .
The worst thing about Emacs is finding out how it does anything .
I would n’t call it discoverable .
In fact , on several occasions , I ’ve learned about Emacs by accident : you press the wrong key combination ( easy to do when you ’re holding down a couple of keys and stretching for a third ) and , look , something interesting happens !
The rest of this article describes a few of these happy accidents : modes I never knew about and tricks I wish I ’d learned earlier .
Whenever I see the Emacs splash screen ( click on the graphic for a close - up ) I ’m amazed anyone ever gets past it .
Computer users want instant gratification and a familiar interface — thus the encouraging tip :
You can do basic editing with the menu bar and scroll bar using the mouse .
Unhappily the rest of the screen discredits this friendly proposition .
Where are the menu and scroll bars [ 1 ] , and what ’s with all the Control this and Meta that ?
If the scratchy artwork and bizarre mix of font styles do n’t put new users off , the remaining content surely will , with its dark warnings about sessions crashing and how to recover [ 2 ] .
Best of all , though , is the opening proposition :
GNU Emacs is one component of the GNU operating system
which I read as a straight - faced rebuttal of the old gag :
It is a common joke , both among fans and detractors of Emacs , to describe it as an operating system masquerading as an editor [ 3 ] .
GNU has n’t quite become an operating system but it does supply most of the standard Unix tools and Emacs works beautifully with them — even on ( Cyg - ) Windows .
META -!
executes a single shell command , for example .
META -| executes a shell command on the current region and puts the output in a temporary buffer .
META -X grep and META - X grep - find build search on top of grep and find .
META -X shell opens up a shell window within Emacs , meaning you can run shell commands and process their output using the standard editor commands .
Emacs info is a better man page browser than info .
And so on .
OS integration examples META -!
META-| META -X grep META - X grep - find META -X shell
When Emacs shells out to external tools their execution is never hidden from you , so you lose none of the power of these tools .
The converse of this also holds : if you do n’t know how to use grep and find , even basic search commands in Emacs will seem cryptic and hard to customise .
Emacs is , above all else , customisable .
In fact , most of Emacs is customisation , and you ’ll soon give up on it if you ca n’t accept this [ 4 ] .
Over at Coding Horror , Jeff Atwood talks about “ large display paradox ” :
One of the advantages of small monitors , ironically , is that because they ’re small , they nudge users into a simpler , windowless method of working .
Instead of wasting time sizing , moving , and z- ordering windows , users only need to deal with one maximized window at a time .
They can flip between maximized applications in much the same way they change channels on the television .
But once your display gets to 1600 x 1200 or beyond , this easy one - app - per - display model is n’t feasible any more …
That ’s the large display paradox .
Having all that space can make you less productive due to all the window manipulation excise you have to deal with to make effective use of it .
Well , I reckon Emacs has this problem cracked .
On a small screen you can use a single maximised window : CTRL -X B switches editor buffers ( a bit like tabbed browsing ) and CTRL -X CTRL - B gets you a buffer management window .
On a large screen CTRL -X 3 splits the enclosing window vertically , and CTRL - X 2 splits it horizontally .
Repeat these commands to slice up your work space .
CTRL -X 1 gets you back to a single window .
The same commands work when you have n’t got a proper windowing environment — on a stripped down server for example , or one which has n’t booted properly .
Very handy !
Buffer and window management CTRL-X B CTRl - X CTRL - B CTRL-X 3 CTRL-X 2 CTRL-X 1
If , for example , the stripped down server discussed in the previous section allows SSH access or similar , you do n’t need to install or run Emacs natively .
Just use tramp mode ( Transparent Remote file Access , Multiple Protocol ) .
Quoting from the manual :
To access the file localname on the remote machine machine you would specify the filename / machine : localname . …
You can specify protocol ( ftp , rsh , smb etc. ) and user name too :
So , to connect to the machine melancholia as daniel , using the ssh method to transfer files , and edit .emacs in my home directory I would specify the filename /ssh:daniel@melancholia:.emacs .
You can omit both username and protocol : the former defaults to your current username , the latter to SSH .
As usual , there are plenty of configuration options .
I have n’t touched any of them .
Tramp mode just works : if I can access a remote machine , I can edit files on it and transfer files to and from it just as if it were local .
Remote editing example Find file : /ssh:daniel@melancholia:.emacs
Programmers often need to view the raw bytes packed into a file , and occasionally to edit these byte values .
That ’s what Hexl mode is for .
META -X hexl - find - file opens a file in this mode and META - X hexl - mode switches a buffer to this mode .
META -X hexl - find - file META - X hexl - mode
Did you know that Emacs can work on .zip , .tar , .tgz etc archives directly ?
I found out when I opened one by accident : Emacs presents you with a view of the archive and you can browse files , edit them , rename them , remove them from the archive , and save the modified archive without ever having to manually extract it .
No special knowledge required : it just works , a bit like dired - mode .
If you open a directory with Emacs it puts you in dired - mode , the Emacs take on Windows Explorer , OS X Finder and so on .
Many of the Emacs users I know do n’t use this mode , preferring either the native system file manager or plain old terminal windows for file operations ( copy , move , list , … ) but I use it all the time and it ’s led to many happy Emacs accidents .
As an example , suppose you have a directory full of files with names - like - this , and you want to rename all the files to use names_like_this instead .
Just switch to editable dired mode , run a standard search and replace to swap hyphens for underscores , then save the directory .
As a second example , suppose you want to view thumbnails of all the .png files in a directory .
Use a pattern match % m png to “ mark ” them ( i.e. select them ) then CTRL -t d to display them .
Now you can visit the thumbnails , removing , renaming , copying the associated files .
Cryptic , yes , but powerful , and no mouse required — handy for laptops .
You can hear when someone sitting nearby does n’t know about editor macros or is using an editor which does n’t support them .
The tedious repetition of the same sequence of keystrokes grows audible .
In Emacs you start recording a keyboard macro with CTRL -X ( and finish recording with CTRL - X ) .
Everything typed between these bracketed commands has been recorded as a keyboard macro which CTRL - X e executes and then e repeats .
If typing all those eeeeee ’s is repetitive , supply a repeat count .
A repeat count of 0 processes the whole buffer , and is often what ’s wanted .
There ’s far more to keyboard macros but this basic use alone will save your fingers and your sanity .
CTRL-X ( CTRL-X ) CTRL-X e
Emacs has a proven architecture : a compact , stable core which is dynamically configured by a huge library of scripts .
These scripts are written in elisp .
You can edit , reload and add to them at any point , without the need to reboot the main application .
Rebooting would n’t be such a big thing , though — Emacs starts up in less than a couple of seconds — what ’s important is that Emacs is dynamic to the core .
So it ’s not surprising Emacs has great modes for dynamic languages like Python , Ruby , Scheme .
Here ’s how to develop Python code using Emacs :
Pull up a full - screen window
Split the window vertically
Use one side for the code you ’re working on
Use the other side to run an interpreted session
Switch sides as desired
You continually select regions of code to execute .
You step into the interpreter and use the Python help command to get help on modules and functions — including the ones you ’re creating right now .
You rework a function in one window then exercise it in the other .
You sketch experimental code , run it , rub it out .
The same technique works for Scheme and Ruby , and is likely to work for any other dynamic language .
The gap between writing and running code disappears .
As computers grow more powerful , specialised programmers ’
IDEs do what they can to support this style of working for compiled languages .
I understand Eclipse parses , compiles , and executes Java code as you write it , and it ’s certainly an impressive piece of software .
I ’d be interested to know how it fares with C ++.
Emacs also works well enough with compiled languages .
I ’ve heard Make described as REPL for compiled languages , and make -k is the default Emacs compile command .
The usual IDE things are available .
For more interactive probing of a compiled executable , META - X gdb is about as good an interface to GDB as I ’ve seen .
But I ca n’t ( for example ) imagine Emacs persuading anyone to dispense with Visual Studio for .
Net development .
This article cherry - picks a few Emacs modes you may not have discovered which I find invaluable .
I have n’t bothered listing the basics of how to open or close files , without which you wo n’t get anywhere .
One basic command I do want to mention is META -/ , which dynamically expands whatever you ’re typing whatever mode you ’re in .
I think of it as code completion for cheats , since it does n’t parse any source code and it works equally well on any type of file type .
It ’s as useful as shell TAB - completion and I discovered it by accident .
You ca n’t edit photo , video or audio content in Emacs ( perhaps I should say I do n’t know of an Emacs mode for doing so [ 5 ] ) .
I do n’t use Emacs for spreadsheets or other “ office ” documents .
You can use Emacs for ascii-art ( and here ’s a great flash animation showing someone do just that ) but ascii - art does n’t look much good outside source code .
Hardcore Emacs users swear by their editor as an email client and even use it as a web browser .
I prefer the comfort of my second most used application , Firefox .
Come to think of it , Firefox adopts a lot of what ’s good about Emacs : the tabbed window , for example , which reinvents multiple buffers for the web browser ; the clean , simple look [ 6 ] ; the extensible architecture .
Funnily enough , you can work with photo , video and audio using Firefox ; and boring old online office suites have been news for a long while .
Amazingly , you can continue to edit your rich media content even if you switch to Internet Explorer , without the need to relearn anything ; a transition which puts the Vi / Emacs wars into perspective .
Could the web browser be the one true editor of the future ?
My thanks to Hugh Brown for pointing out a couple of errors with the original version of this article .
[ 1 ] OK , so my .emacs disables the scroll bar and menu bar before this splash screen appears , but telling people what their mouse is for hardly seems necessary .
[ 2 ] I ca n’t remember when Emacs last crashed on me .
It ’s one of the three applications I auto - start on login and I usually leave it running until I shutdown .
On occasion I ’ve forced it to quit but this has always been down to my own error , for example coding and executing ( within Emacs ) a tight loop .
[ 3 ] Quoted from Eric S. Raymond ’s excellent book “ The Art of Unix Programming ”
[ 4 ]
In “ The Art of Unix Programming ” Eric S. Raymond discusses the question : “ Is Emacs an Argument against the Unix Tradition ? ” .
This is a rather long quotation to include here , I know , but I ’m sure the author would n’t want me to alter his words in any way .
I highly recommend the book and suggest you buy a copy to read in full .
The central tension in the Unix tradition has always been between doing more with less and doing more with more .
It recurs in a lot of different contexts , often as a struggle between designs that have the quality of clean minimalism and others that choose expressive range and power even at the cost of high complexity .
For both sides , the arguments for or against Emacs have exemplified this tension since it was first ported to Unix in the early 1980s .
Programs that are both as useful and as large as Emacs make Unix programmers uncomfortable precisely because they force us to face the tension .
They suggest that old - school Unix minimalism is valuable as a discipline , but that we may have fallen into the error of dogmatism .
There are two ways Unix programmers can address this problem .
One is to deny that large is actually large .
The other is to develop a way of thinking about complexity that is not a dogma .
Our thought experiment with replacing Lisp and the extension libraries gives us a new perspective on the oft - heard charge that Emacs is bloated because its extension library is so large .
Perhaps this is as unfair as charging that / bin / sh is bloated because the collection of all shellscripts on a system is large .
Emacs could be considered a virtual machine or framework around a collection of small , sharp tools ( the modes ) that happen to be written in Lisp
On this view , the main difference between the shell and Emacs is that Unix distributors do n’t ship all the world ’s shellscripts along with the shell .
Objecting to Emacs because having a general - purpose language in it feels like bloat is approximately as silly as refusing to use shellscripts because shell has conditionals and for loops .
Just as one does n’t have to learn shell to use shellscripts , one does n’t have to learn Lisp to use Emacs .
If Emacs has a design problem , it ’s not so much the Lisp interpreter ( the framework part ) as the fact that the mode library is an untidy heap of historical accretions — but that ’s a source of complexity users can ignore , because they wo n’t be affected by what they do n’t use .
This mode of argument is very comforting .
It can be applied to other tool - integration frameworks , such as the ( uncomfortably large ) GNOME and KDE desktop projects .
There is some force to it .
And yet , we should be suspicious of any ‘ perspective ’ that offers to resolve all our doubts so neatly ; it might be a rationalization , not a rationale .
Therefore , let ’s avoid the possibility of falling into denial and accept that Emacs is both useful and large — that it is an argument against Unix minimalism .
What does our analysis of the kinds of complexity in it , and the motives for it , suggest beyond that ?
And is there reason to believe that those lessons generalize ?

So now I know better !
In a comment on this site , Johan Lindstrom says you can edit video using Emacs , http://1010.co.uk/gneve.html, and in an email Arnold Mátyási pointed me at this YouTube GNEVE demo , while over at reddit another comment mentions an audio editing mode , http://delysid.org/emacs/ecasound-el.html.

Terracycle is most known for their reuse of plastic soda bottles as packaging for their Worm Poop gardening products .
While these initial products are definitely to be commended , it ’s their recent move into office and school products in conjunction with Office Max that stands to make an even more profound impact .
Many people spend a great deal of time working in offices , and to have a mainstream supplier actively promoting awareness about the value of using green office products will likely lead to many people that may not have previously found relevance in their lives to consider more deeply what they choose to purchase for their office , and perhaps other parts of their lives .
Why Office Max ?
Why exactly did Terracycle , the scrappy company ( literally , reusing scrap production waste in some products ) decide to partner with the massive Office Max ?
Listen up green startups , this is important :
They are able to go beyond their youthful excitement about all things green , and hear from people with decades of experience what consumers are actually buying , where they want things to be greener , and where the most impact can be made .
And , having a large , deeply ingrained distribution network , Office Max can also allow Terracycle to more confidently venture into making new products , with a sharply reduced time on the development cycle .
This plus being able to produce larger numbers right away leads to being able to keep their prices at an everyday level , so that a broad segment of the population can and will try them .
Review of innovative green office products from Terracycle
So where does that lead Terracycle ?
It leads them to start with 7 new products , and have several more coming soon , including paper made from Mango leaves .
More on that below .
I had the pleasure of trying many of them out , and here ’s what I found :
Trash and recycling cans :
Beyond being made from a combination or recycled computer cases and other company ’s product production waste ( of which there is a lot of ) they are quite attractive .
With a pattern of lines accenting each side and hand sized grips built in to carry it , this recyclable recycling container is a gem .
Eco binders :
Bringing me back to my Pee Chee days , these sturdy , bare paper binders are made from 100 % recycled paper and the clips inside 90 % recycled metal .
And in an industry first , when you ’re done with them , you can send them back to be recycled by Terracycle .
A quote of note on the packaging :
Because it is constructed using waste stream resources , our Eco-Binders are priced competitively , allowing you an eco-friendly choice without a premium price .
Natural all purpose and window cleaners :
I ca n’t yet speak from experience of their utility , but I can say they are packaged from former old 1 liter soda bottles , are non toxic , with clean ingredients you can read , and they ’re biodegradable .
They are doubly certified by Zero Footprint and Environmental Choice , from Canada .
And they just look nice , sitting there on your counter !
Now if I could just get motivated to actually clean …
Drink pouch pencil case : Remember drinking Capri Sun as a kid ?
Remember recycling them ?
Probably not , as they are n’t .
Well were n’t , until Terracycle came along and decided to make pencil cases out of them .
Mine is two jade colored Kool - Aid Sports sewn end to end , with a zipper holding your contents in place .
Visually unique , these cases come with a fringe benefit : at 1300 schools and non profits nationally , they collect these juice bags , and Terracycle pays them per bag collected , serving as both a fundraiser and a waste stream diverter .
Going even further , these cases are created in their own factory in Mexico .
They ’re not outsourced , but rather , a new operation entirely controlled by Terracycle to assure quality working conditions , as is the same in their Trenton , New Jersey factory .
They are now the largest employer in Aquascalientes .
Beyond these products , they ’ve also got a natural degreaser , bathroom cleaner , and drain clearer .
Future green innovation from Terracycle
In conversation with Albert Zakes of Terracycle , he let me in on some intriguing new products being developed , in tandem with the suggestions of Office Max .
Of highest priority are paper and pens .
Really ?
Yes , if you think about it , those are some of the most used resources in an office , and in the case of pens , most disposed of .
Rhino paper :
Yes , they are currently working on paper made from the dung of Rhinos .
And Elephants .
Apparently they make a fine sheet of paper without the stink you might expect .
However , Office Max encouraged them to innovate in other ways that people with a lower tolerance for funk would like .
Thus , they are now creating tree free paper made from fallen Mango and Banana leaves .
Twig pens :
They have found a way to create durable , unique pens that are made from fallen twigs , sealed to prevent splinters , and ready to go .
They are also working on pens made from recycled tire rubber and newspaper .
Congratulations to Terracycle for boldly stepping out of the garden and into the office and classroom .
Stay tuned for future articles on some as yet to be public partnerships and other things in the works .
Readers :

In the days after the assault began , hundreds of families , their belongings packed high on tractor - trailers , fled north from villages in the southern part of the battle zone , according to marines staffing a checkpoint .
The Taliban told them to leave as the fighting began , they said .
Hospital officials in the provincial capital , Lashkar Gah , reported receiving eight civilian casualties as a result of the fighting , including a 14 - year - old boy who died from his injuries .
The marines did not sustain any casualties , but one was killed and two were wounded in subsequent clashes .
Marines from the unit ’s Company C said the reaction from the returning civilians , mostly farmers , had been favorable .
“ Everyone says they do n’t like the Taliban , ” said Capt .
John Moder , 34 , the commander of the company .
People had complained that the Taliban stole food , clothes and vehicles from them , he said .
There are about 34,000 American troops in Afghanistan , with more than 3,000 marines having been sent into the country after NATO requested additional help in the south , where the Taliban are particularly strong .
The deployment occurred almost a year after up to 19 unarmed civilians were killed and 50 people wounded on March 4 , 2007 , when a Marine convoy opened fire after a suicide car bomb wounded one marine .
On Friday , the Marine Corps said it would not bring charges against two of the commanding officers from the F Company , Second Marine Special Operations Battalion for the episode , a decision that was greeted with dismay in Afghanistan .
The commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan , Gen. Dan K. McNeill , had a checklist of tasks around the country for 3,200 marines when they arrived in March .
But the majority of them have spent a month in Garmser after changing their original plan , which was to secure a single road here , when they realized how important the area was to the Taliban as an infiltration and supply route to fighters in northern part of Helmand Province .
“ This is an artery , and we did not realize that when we squeezed that artery , it would have such an effect , ” said First Lt. Mark Matzke , the executive officer of Company C .

They also realized it was worth exploiting their initial success .
The whole area was unexpectedly welcoming to the American forces and eager for security and development , Captain Moder said .
“ Us pushing the Taliban out allows the Afghan National Army to come in , ” he said .
“ This is a real breadbasket here .
There ’s a lot of potential here . ”
As oil prices rise , Cheney praises Saudi Arabia John Byrne

Print This Email This Comment comes as gas prices hit record high in US history
On his whirlwind tour of US allies in the Middle East , Vice President Dick Cheney praised oil giant Saudi Arabia for keeping their word on increasing oil production as prices of gasoline in the United States soars .
Cheney told reporters in Jerusalem that the Saudis " kept their word " when they promised in 2005 to boost production .
" From a capacity of 10.5 million barrels a day in 2005 , they will hit 12.5 million barrels by 2009 , " the Wall Street Journal writes .
" They are currently at 11.8 million .
" Vice President Dick Cheney suggested there is little more Saudi Arabia can do to increase oil production and relieve price pressures in global markets , " the Journal added .
Gas prices reached an all time last week .
On average , the price of gas has increased by 7 cents over the past two weeks , to a record - breaking inflation - adjusted $ 3.26 .
Asked about the US military death toll of 4,000 , Cheney said it is a " tragedy " that we live in such a world , but " we do live in that kind of world . "
Cheney also lashed out at Iran and Syria for " doing everything they can to torpedo the peace process " by supporting militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas .
During talks with Israeli and Palestinian leadership , " I reaffirmed the president 's commitment to help the process forward , " Cheney said .
US President George W. Bush has said he hoped the two sides could strike a deal before he ends his term in January 2009 .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , who met twice with Cheney during his visit " reaffirmed his commitment to the president 's vision and his willigness to do everything he can to achieve a result in 2008 although he is well aware of the difficulties , " Cheney said .
Oil prices slipped nearly $ 1 a barrel Monday as traders worried that the flagging U.S. economy would cause oil demand to soften .
Oil 's sharp decline started last week .
Crude futures started plunging after the U.S. Federal Reserve - backed sale of Bear Stearns Cos. to JPMorgan Chase & Co. created fears of deeper economic problems .
Prices dropped around 10 percent during the shortened trading week from a trading record of $ 111.80 hit last Monday .

Project Censored announces its pick of the top 25 news stories to be spiked in the last 12 months ...
Each year since 1976 , hundreds of student researchers , faculty , and volunteer members have presented the most important news stories that were under - covered , glossed over or ignored by the US ’s major media outlets .
Their 25 stories this year make up the first chapter of the Censored 2008 yearbook , which also offers real news about internet freedom , images of the war , and the impact of Big Media on children .
With an introduction by Dennis Loo and the political cartoon commentary of John Jonik , this year ’s book covers some of the most critical issues facing the American people today .
The Top 25 stories focus on issues such as civil rights , politics , economics , foreign policy , food and health , the environment , energy , domestic policy , and the military .
“ Corporate media in the United States is interested primarily in entertainment news to feed their bottom - line priorities , ” states Peter Phillips , Director of the Project .
“ Some of the most important news stories that should reach the American public falls on the cutting room floor to be replaced by sex - scandals and celebrity updates . ”
The Sonoma State University research group is composed of over 200 faculty , students and community experts who review hundreds of story submissions for coverage , content , reliability of sources and national significance .
The top 25 stories are submitted to a panel of judges who then rank them in order of importance .
Phillips says we must broaden our understanding of censorship in the US .
" No longer is the dictionary definition of direct government control of news adequate .
The private corporate media in the US significantly undercover and / or deliberately censor numerous important news stories every year , " he adds .
" The systemic erosion of human rights and civil liberties , in the US , is the common theme of many of the most censored stories of 2006 - 07 .
" Most people in the US believe in our Bill of Rights and value personal freedoms .
Yet , our corporate media in the past year failed to inform us about serious changes in our civil rights and liberties . "
People want to be informed about serious decisions made by the powerful and rely on the corporate media to keep us abreast of important changes , despite their busy lives , Phillips says .
" When a media fails to cover these issues , what else can we call it but censorship ? "

Science have an interesting snippet on a study that shows that shy children may not only be more sensitive to unpleasant things , and also to pleasurable and rewarding experiences as well .
A brain scanning study led by Dr Amanda Guyer showed that areas of the brain sensitive to both anxiety and reward were more strongly activated in shy children than other children .
The study subjects – who were classified as either shy or outgoing based on psychological testing – were instructed to press a button as quickly as possible after being shown a signal .
If they pressed the button in time , they won money , or at least prevented themselves from losing it .
Both groups performed similarly , and there was no difference in the activity of their amygdalas – the brain region that governs fear .
Shy children , however , showed two to three times more activity in their striatum , which is associated with reward , than outgoing children , the team reports in the 14 June issue of the Journal of Neuroscience .
“ Up until now , people thought that [ shyness ] was mostly related to avoidance of social situations , ” says co-author and child psychiatrist Monique Ernst .
“ Here we showed that shy children have increased activity in the reward system of the brain as well . ”
