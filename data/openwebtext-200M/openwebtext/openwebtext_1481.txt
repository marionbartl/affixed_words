Entrance to Sacred Heart of Jesus elementary school in Boulder , Colorado
Boulder , Colorado
Two Boulder women have been at the center of a firestorm of media attention here for the past ten days since news broke that their daughters would no longer be welcome at the Sacred Heart of Jesus parish school because their mothers are lesbians .
Local media have been covering the story seemingly around the clock .
Television crews have come to the school .
Articles , letters to the editors , and opinion pieces , including one by Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput in support of the expulsion , have appeared .
Protesters have shown up outside the church with banners calling shame on parishioners .
Police have been called in to patrol the school grounds for the safety of the children .
Division has emerged within the parish though many Catholics – and others – here ask themselves how this could possibly have occurred in their progressive , welcoming community .
Referred to as " the mothers " by those who do not know the couple and by those who do and want to protect their identities , the women have avoided all media contacts and interviews – until now .
They also asked that they not be photographed .
I sat down with the women , both professional physicians , in the living room of their home here , walls covered with framed photographs of their five - year - old and three - year - old daughters .
As we spoke for more than an hour , a long haired dog playfully rolled on the living room carpet before us .
The couple explained they agreed to speak with NCR because they wanted to clear up misconceptions in the media and specifically wanted Catholics to better understand their situation .
The women , members of the Sacred Heart parish , describe themselves as practicing Catholics eager to raise their children in the faith of their parents and grandparents .
They say they attend Mass weekly at the parish with their children and continue to believe Sacred Heart of Jesus school , which includes a pre-school and kindergarten through eighth grade , excels in education and Catholic formation .
The women , meanwhile , said they have been overwhelmed by the media coverage and by the support they have received by friends and family .
They said they are not political activists and have no agenda other than providing for the safety of their children .
For this reason they asked not to be identified by name .
Following is their story , as they told it together .
For the sake of the report I distinguish between them , when necessary , using the names Mary and Martha .
" People are making assumptions about us that are flat wrong , completely wrong , and we felt it was time to clear up some of these misconceptions , " Mary said as we began the interview .
From the time they first enrolled at Sacred Heart three years back they never hid the fact that they are a lesbian couple , they said .
" We decided for a number of reasons to send our children to Sacred Heart School , " Mary said .
" We have loved it there .
Our children were thriving there .
When we first enrolled our daughter in pre-school we told the school administrators our daughter had two moms .
We asked if this was going to be a problem .
We said that if it was going to be a problem we could go else where .
We were very open and they said it would not be a problem . "

The women said they never made a " big issue " of their family situation .
" We have never flaunted it or pushed any political agenda at the school at all , " Mary continued .
" The parents know ; the teachers know .
We 've sat with the kindergarten teachers and have talked with them .
Never over a three year period we never had any indication that it would be a problem at all .
We found it to be a very accepting environment for our child . "
All seemed quite natural until a it came time for next year 's enrollment a couple weeks back , Martha recalled .
" I went in to turn in our daughter 's kindergarten application and was called into the principal 's office .
That 's when , she said , she got " blind sided . "
" She sat me down and told me we were no longer accepted here any more .
She said it was not going to be a good fit for our child and that she would encourage us to look elsewhere , " Martha went on , explaining the principal said she was worried there could be confusion when the teachers teach about the family unit .
" Her main point was she was concerned about our child , about her well - being .
She never came out and said we were not welcomed to stay .
But she pretty much told us it was time for us to move on . "
That evening the women discussed what was said adding they were upset and so they decided they wanted clarification because the principal had stopped short of saying their daughter could not enroll , just that it would not be wise to do so .
Mary said she called the principal and asked for clarification .
She recalls asking : " Are you just worried about how this is going to be for my child because of the church 's stance on homosexuality ? "
She said she told the principal that if that was the case the women could handle it .
I told her we did not expect any accommodations for our children based on our family situation .
She then asked directly : " Are you telling us we are not allowed ? "
At that point , Mary said , the principal replied that she needed to call the archdiocese .
The next day , with the principal and the pastor of Sacred Heart parish , Fr. William Breslin , on the line , the women were told that their daughters could stay one more year in school and after that they would be out .
What changed ?
The women say they do n't know .
They said they were told that the issue had been thoroughly discussed by the parish administrators .
Yet the women said they never heard of any complaints about their children being in the school from teachers or parents .
" At first we were conflicted about what the right response would be , " Mary said .
" We knew there was potential for this to become a big deal .
But we felt it would be in our children's ' best interest to simply focus on finding other educational opportunities for them . "
" We did not feel then and we still do n't feel now that pushing the church to change its mind would be in our children 's best interests .
We do n't want our children to become targets in a place where they were not welcome .
So we decided to meet with Father Bill and send a letter to the archbishop and we would leave it at that . "
They women said they were " personally hurt , personally upset , " but decided it was time " to move on . "
But that was not the end .
It turned out to be only the beginning .
Following the decision the parish administrators told the school teachers and as best the women can reconstruct one of the teachers contacted a local television news channel .
Word of the decision was soon flashed on local television and the story appeared the next morning in the Daily Camera .
" Within hours it was out to the entire community , " Martha said .
" The parents knew ; it was the talk of the parking lot .
This started on a Monday and by Thursday when I went to drop off our children I had people I did n't even know coming up to me and hugging me with tears in their eyes .
We had n't told any of them .
It was spreading like wildfire .
And it did n't come from us . "
The women said there have been surprises along the way .
One of the biggest was the amount of support they quickly received from parents at Sacred Heart school .
" We have been around for years but just did n't think much about it and did n't think that it would be such an issue for so many , " Mary said .
" It meant a lot coming from this group of people . "
Was this somehow about making a point on gay issues ?
" People have suggested that we put our children in the school to make a political point or that we are fighting this battle and making our children political footballs .
This is not the case , " Martha insisted .
" You are the first person we have talked to .
We have n't spoken to any of the reporters who have wanted to speak with us .
We value our privacy . "
Both of the moms were born and raised Catholics .
Mary went to Catholic schools from pre-school through 12th grade .
Martha went to Notre Dame [ UNIVERISITY ??? ] .
Mary 's mother taught in a Catholic school system for 25 years .
Martha 's aunt was a Catholic school teacher for decades .
" We have a lot of history with the Catholic school system .
It is what we are familiar with .
It is what we are comfortable with .
We value what a Catholic education can do for our kids , " Martha said .
As for Sacred Heart , the women say it has been good place for their children 's education .
They say they appreciate the moral foundation the teachers have provided .
They say they support the character of Catholic education .
They say it is very important to them that their children be provided with religious education .
" We want our kids to learn about religion .
We feel religion is really important .
And they love it .
They love God .
They love their school .
They love their friends .
They love their teachers , " Mary said .
The women take pride in the fact that their children like to repeat bible stories they learn in school .
They say they encourage these stories .
Mary and Martha each gave birth to one of the children .
Legally each has joint custody of both children .
The women are not legally married .
They have lived in Colorado for nearly a decade and Colorado does not allow gay marriages .
Each of the children was baptized by local priests , one who is in a neighboring parish and another who has been reassigned outside the area .
The baptisms followed by months the publication of a 2006 statement issued by the U.S. bishops offering guidelines to ministers and parents of gay and lesbian children .
The outlines suggest baptism for children of gays and lesbians , the women say , as long as there is a reasonable assumption that the children will be raised as Catholics .
" They asked if we would raise our children in the Catholic faith and we said we would and we have really tried to live up to that commitment , " Martha said .
" We take them to church every week .
We switched to the Sacred Heart parish when our kids starting going to the school .
We signed up and our money goes into the basket every week .
Our kids go to Sunday school .
We are making the effort . "
Part of the disappointment for the women is that they feel the Catholic church is now not fulfilling its part of the promise to provide all the support it can in the raising of the children as Catholics .
Said Mary : " We are trying to live up to the promises we make to raise our kids as Catholics and now the church we made the promise to is sort of undermining our attempts to do so . "
They said they were shocked when a local priest suggested they raise their children as Episcopalians .
After being told their children could not continue into the elementary school , the women said they spoke with Sacred Heart pastor , Fr. Breslin , and were told they could continue to come to church and that the their children could come to CCD classes .
They then asked what was the difference between CCD education and school education .
" Is n't the doctrine the same ? " they asked .
They felt Breslin was not able to provide an understandable answer .
They say they are also troubled because behind the decision to forbid their children from going to the elementary school is a presumption about their personal lives and that no one ever asked them about what it means for them to live as a couple .
" No one has every asked us if we are celibates .
How do they know we are not upholding official church teachings ? "
Mary asked .
Meanwhile , other parish parents , they say , have been coming to them saying they are not upholding church teachings .
Some have noted they are divorced and remarried without a church blessing .
Others say they are practicing birth control methods contrary to church teachings .
Said Martha : " The frustrating argument for me is that our priest and archbishop are saying we are openly living in disagreement with the doctrine of the church .
They are saying people who are divorced are not as open , but everyone knows they are divorced .
They imply that we are flaunting our relationship .
That is the last thing we do .
We go to church as family .
We never show any affection for each other in church .
We are very private .
But that 's how the archdiocese is seeing it . "
Bottom line , the women regret this whole incident has happened .
They regret it not only for themselves and for their children , but also , they say , for the school .
" This is unfortunate because Sacred Heart is a great school .
Those teachers are dedicated and they are good .
And the families are wonderful .
It 's just the people above .
It 's the administration that 's the problem .
I feel very bad that the school is getting such a black eye from this .
It is a wonderful school . "
The women also regret their children are going to suffer from the decision .
Then they gave a telling example .
Last week they were driving home from school having just picked up their children in the car .
Recalled Martha : " In the car , our older daughter was helping our younger daughter with words from the " Our Father . "
They were both trying to get the words right .
Then they began the " Hail Mary " and we listened we had tears in our eyes .
We were really sad about it because they are going to lose it . "
The women say they have tried really hard not to let anger take a grip on them .
At the same time they wanted , they said , to express their gratitude to the parents of the children in their classes and to the school teachers .
So they wrote them a letter and emailed it , expressing their thanks , trying , as they could , to explain the situation as they best understood it .
They also asked the teachers not to say anything " that could put themselves at risk for our benefit . "
One point that the women wanted me to know and report is that they are not part of any gay movement .
They are not activists .
" You have never seen us at protests or marching in parades .
We never intended to pave the way for gays in the Catholic church .
We just wanted to be a normal family . "
The morning after meeting with Fr. Breslin the women woke up to see their story on the front page of the Boulder paper .
They were shocked and worried .
So they immediately called Breslin and had him paged .
They said they wanted to let him know that the leak did not come from them .
" I actually called to warm him this was coming out .
He needed to know , " said Mary .
" All through this we have decided that we are not going to let our hearts be filled with anger and disgust and hatred .
We decided we are just going to move on , take care of our family and we are going to be fine .
The family is going to be fine and maybe bringing this out to the forefront of people 's minds is going to have some positive effect .
You ca n't let it drag you down . "
Later , the women said they were working on a press statement and wanted to be sure I knew its last sentence so that I could report it .
The sentence reads : " We will continue to raise our children with strong Catholic values and hold faith that through our actions , we are doing our part to create a more loving , inclusive world . "

On May 5th Chris DiDomenico fractured his thigh bone when he ran into the end boards during the QMJHL finals .
At the time we were all impressed with his commitment :
Didomenico , despite his extreme pain , repeated over and over while prone on the ice " je veux la game " to his team mates .
- blue with age
We also worried about his future .
Coming back from a thigh bone injury could affect DiDomenico 's skating and really derail everything he had worked for .
From a Leafs fan perspective DiDo is a prospect who went absolutely crazy in the QMJHL playoffs scoring 35 points in 15 games .
DiDo had signed his ELC in March of 2009 which allowed him to skate with the Leafs ' trainers and use the Leafs ' medical facilities ; something it looks like he took full advantage of .
Last night DiDomenico took the ice again with his team for the first time since May of 2009 and he made a strong statement : the player he was is n't gone .
DiDomenico's Drummondville Voltigeurs beat Victoriaville 4 - 2 and DiDomenico had a goal and three assists .
Welcome back DiDo : we 're all watching .
Andy Chen / The New York Times
Updated , March 3 , 6:00 p.m. | Steve Perry , principal of Capital Preparatory Magnet School in Hartford , joins the discussion .
In an article this week , The Times described the slow progress New York City officials are making in their efforts to get rid of teachers who have been judged incompetent .
Despite a two - year push by the city , only three teachers have been fired , a rate of success that Schools Chancellor Joel Klein called “ far too modest . ”
He and Mayor Michael Bloomberg have blamed the teachers ’ union for defending the rules governing the system , which requires that teachers receive full pay while their cases are being decided ( they spend the days in one of the system ’s so - called rubber rooms ) , a burden that costs $ 30 million a year .
The city ’s critics point out that its officials approved many of the rules in the teachers ’ contract .
New York City is hardly alone .
Many other school systems in the country face problems in getting rid of teachers accused of misconduct or ineptitude — a recent article in Los Angeles Weekly detailed some of the toughest cases there .
A broader question for school reformers in New York City and elsewhere is :
What is the most effective way to identify incompetent teachers and take steps to get rid of them ?
What would a fair and effective system consist of ?
Here ’s a New Process
Timothy Daly is president of the New Teacher Project .
Rhetorically , districts and unions agree on the importance of removing ineffective teachers from the classroom fairly but quickly .
Both sides have been saying this for decades .
And yet it almost never happens .
Why , in some districts , do 99 percent of teachers earn the highest possible rating in evaluations ?
Part of the problem is that , according to current teacher evaluations , ineffective teachers do n’t really exist .
In our recent report , “ The Widget Effect , ” we found that most teachers are evaluated based on short and infrequent observations by administrators that put them into one of just two categories : “ satisfactory ” or “ unsatisfactory . ”
As a result , more than 99 percent of teachers in some districts earn the highest possible rating .
The first step in the solution is simple : fix the evaluations .
Evaluations should include multiple rating categories that allow for a nuanced assessment of teachers ’ abilities .
And since everyone agrees that a teacher ’s primary responsibility is to help students learn , evaluations should emphasize evidence of student learning .
A common objection to more rigorous evaluations is that they give too much power to administrators , who are said to be unable to rate their teachers fairly .
That ’s a cop -out ; just like most teachers are effective , skilled professionals , so are most administrators .
Read more …
The best way to hold administrators accountable for conducting good evaluations is to balance their assessments with objective data about student learning – and that means including standardized tests in the equation .
An administrator would have a hard time justifying a low rating for a teacher whose students show strong evidence of learning on assessments .
When evaluations have been improved , it ’s time to address the dismissal process .
Why does the U.F.T. fight the dismissal of teachers who have failed by any measure ?
The Times article shows why there is reason to question whether unions are serious about going beyond rhetoric to embrace real reforms .
The U.F.T. president Michael Mulgrew says that lengthy dismissal proceedings are “ not good for anyone . ”
On the other hand , the U.F.T. waged an appallingly expensive , multiyear fight on behalf of a teacher found to be ineffective by the peer review program the union helped create .
If the union proceeds this way even when poor performance has been validated , what part of the dismissal process is it actually willing to change ?
Furthermore , in a recent Op - Ed in the New York Post , Mr. Mulgrew wrote about three - day disciplinary hearings that are allowed under current policies but neglected to mention that the Department of Education is prohibited from seeking dismissal in these expedited hearings .
Let ’s all agree that we ’ve done enough talking about dismissing ineffective teachers .
What would it take to have a new process in place by the start of next school year ?
Let the Teachers Decide
Richard D. Kahlenberg is a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and the author of “ All Together Now : Creating Middle - Class Schools through Public School Choice , ” and “ Tough Liberal : Albert Shanker and the Battles Over Schools , Unions , Race and Democracy ” .
When I speak to friends and colleagues about my biography of Albert Shanker , the founding father of modern teacher unions , the No. 1 complaint people have is that unions protect incompetent educators .
Shanker recognized that this was a problem and as president of the American Federation of Teachers was willing to concede that the union did include some “ terrible ” educators who should not be in the profession .
Genuine professions police themselves and teachers can do that as well .
Who should make the decision about which teachers are fired ?
Not the principals , Shanker argued .
They might play favorites and fire excellent teachers with whom they personally clashed .
Besides , how would a principal trained in physical education or history know what makes an excellent French teacher ?
Not administrators , far removed from the classroom , who pore over raw test score data that can be influenced by a host of factors beyond a teacher ’s control .
Instead , Shanker proposed a system of peer review in which excellent teachers from outside a school would come in and try to help struggling teachers develop their talents , but if that did n’t work , recommend that teachers be terminated .
Read more …
Some within the union thought peer review was anathema :
How could a union , which is supposed to represent teachers , recommend that some members be fired ?
But Shanker argued that genuine professions — like law and medicine — policed themselves and teachers should do likewise .
In places where peer review has been employed , like Cincinnati and Toledo , Ohio , the number of incompetent teachers removed is greater than when administrators were in charge .
Why ?
Because every fourth grade teacher suffers when an incompetent third grade teacher fails to educate students .
Superb teachers are ideally positioned to weed out substandard ones .
How Tests Can Identify the Inept
Marcus Winters is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute , where he has done several studies on education testing and school report cards .
How much does teacher quality matter ?
A good teacher can mean as much as a grade level ’s worth of learning in a school year .
Getting rid of bad teachers is by far the most effective education reform we could hope to enact .
Only 25 of New York City ’s 6,250 eligible teachers ( 0.4 percent ) were denied tenure in 2006 .
Before we can weed out bad teachers , we first need to identify them .
Current evaluation systems based on classroom observation do n’t even try to do this .
Urban school districts across the country routinely grant “ satisfactory ” or above ratings to over 99 percent of teachers .
These evaluation systems produce homogenous results because they forgo objective measures of teacher quality .
Thanks to widespread standardized testing that matches student learning to his classroom teacher , we can now do a better job of identifying poor teachers .
Modern statistical techniques allow researchers to measure a teacher ’s independent contribution to his students ’ learning .
These techniques are not perfect , but they do raise red flags .
We should use them .
Read more …
But even the best information about teacher quality is unhelpful if school systems ca n’t act upon it .
The iron - clad job protections of tenure ensure that a teacher remains on the payroll no matter how ineffective he is in the classroom .
In 2007 , only 10 of the 55,000 tenured teachers in New York City were fired for any reason .
Neither are we too discriminating when deciding who gets tenure .
Principals denied tenure to only 2 percent of New York teachers who were eligible to receive it last year .
Believe it or not , that ’s actually an improvement — only 25 of Gotham ’s 6,250 eligible teachers ( 0.4 percent ) were denied tenure in 2006 .
If tenure is to exist at all , it should be treated as a privilege , not a right .
Principals need to scrutinize which teachers do and do n’t deserve tenure , and the school system should hold accountable those school leaders who do n’t take that responsibility seriously .
And no teacher should be immune from the consequences of poor performance , no matter how long he has been in the classroom .
That ’s a two - step solution to the teacher quality problem : first distinguish between effective and ineffective teachers , and then use that information .
Adopting that sensible plan takes political courage from Albany — state law currently prohibits schools from using test scores in determining whether a teacher receives tenure and provides tenure ’s job protections .
We have the tools to improve teacher quality .
Unfortunately , pursuing this fairly obvious strategy has proved to be frustratingly difficult .
Why Some Teachers Hold Out
Molly Pease has taught at the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology in Brooklyn for almost seven years .
She currently teaches government and economics in the social studies department .
I believe , and I think most teachers at my school believe , that the “ rubber room ” is a taint on the entire school system .
There should definitely be cleaner , quicker , and more humane ways to fire a teacher .
Incompetence can be difficult to prove within the given system .
The slow “ firing system ” allows teachers to hang on to their jobs and benefits as long as possible .
The system gives teachers ( and rightfully so ) great health care , pension ( the more years you accrue , the more you receive ) , tax deferred annuities ( 401K ) , etc. , and many teachers definitely feel entrenched .
If I were suddenly deemed incompetent and sent to the rubber room , I might , depending on my state of life , hold out for as long as possible , too .
If the system wants to make the firing process quicker , perhaps it should offer incompetent teachers some type of training / job - seeking course , and maybe pay them the money in their pension ( if they have not vested ) .
Read more …
Identifying incompetent teachers is a more difficult issue .
The reason the union and the school system are struggling to find a proper way to fire incompetent teachers is because they cannot agree upon the traits that define an “ incompetent ” teacher .
There are , of course , many clear signs of incompetency , like chronic lateness / absenteeism , sexual harassment , drunkenness , disregard of students or complete lack of classroom control , etc .
But even these acts can be difficult to prove by a supervisor within the given system .
How does a supervisor prove incompetence ?
A doctor might have low scores based on outcomes , a lawyer might not get the right verdict , a corporate manager might not see a profit — but what about teachers ?
If a supervisor uses test scores , where does that leave teachers of special education students ?
A supervisor could use student surveys , but are 16 – year - olds reliable judges ?
( Surveys and test scores are used on the school report cards ) .
I teach at a school that has an extremely competent staff .
The only way to ensure that a school has competent teachers is to visit the school , and sit in the classrooms , and make sure that the principal is visiting the classrooms , and not just once a year – but over and over and over again .
Teachers need to be used to having others in their classroom , and they need to talk about their students , lesson plans and goals for the classroom .
Only those interested in teaching should stay in the system ; those who are n’t should seek other professions .
Give Principals Real Control
Don Soifer is the executive vice president and an education analyst at the Lexington Institute , a free - market think tank .
A system that requires schools to pay upwards of $ 350,000 in fees , arbitration and salary , and then wait three years to dismiss an ineffective teacher , ca n’t possibly be working in the interests of children .
But simply transferring those teachers to different schools to avoid the hassle and expense of the termination process is just as outrageous .
Unless principals have the authority to fire teachers , the system will remain broken .
The ability of reform - minded chancellors , like New York ’s Joel Klein and Michelle Rhee in Washington , to succeed in turning around schools that have been recalcitrant to improvement for decades depends on transforming the culture of those schools to one where success can thrive .
Principals , as the educational leaders of their schools , should be held accountable for their results .
But unless they also have both the authority to make the personnel decisions on which those results largely depend , and the flexibility to carry them out , the system is broken and their ability to succeed is severely compromised .
Read more …
Likewise , Chancellor Klein ’s leadership in using strong data systems that measure student growth and allow teachers to target instruction to best address learning needs is an essential component to improving public schools .
But teacher union leadership that has fought the use of meaningful student performance data in teacher evaluations and tenure decisions is not simply harmful to the interests of children , but harmful to teachers as well .
Most teachers are dedicated , hardworking professionals who want their schools to be effective organizations geared toward producing the highest - quality education .
But the highly politicized leadership of the National Education Association , the American Federation of Teachers and their New York affiliates who have consistently pressed , through advocacy and collective bargaining , against allowing school leaders the use of these essential tools , may be as much a part of the problems as the rubber rooms themselves .
Early Intervention
Aaron Pallas is a professor of sociology and education at Teachers College , Columbia University .
The big issues are what count in teacher incompetence , and preventing it in the first place .
Many things are labeled as evidence of teacher incompetence : an accusation of inappropriate behavior toward a student ( e.g. , corporal punishment ) ; a principal ’s judgment that a teacher cannot maintain order in the classroom , or has poorly prepared lessons ; a teacher ’s inability to find a new teaching position somewhere in the system after his / her school closed or after being laid off ; and teachers being ranked below most of their peers in their measured contribution to their students ’ standardized test scores , to name just a few .
The best hedge against teacher incompetence is careful evaluation and support for teachers early in their careers .
Whether each of these examples should be considered evidence of incompetence is a matter of judgment .
Laid off teachers , for example , are commonly believed to be bad teachers but sometimes it ’s just a matter of budget constraints .
And defining the teachers in the bottom 25 percent based on contributions to students ’ test scores as incompetent is an arbitrary threshold — the bottom 25 percent of a highly qualified group may still be very competent .
Read more …
It ’s true that some issues must be hammered out at the bargaining table .
Teachers should not be kept on the city payroll indefinitely after being laid off , but they need to be given a fair opportunity to find new positions ; and teachers accused of professional misconduct are entitled to due process and a speedy disposition of their cases , without spending years in limbo .
But the best hedge against teacher incompetence is careful evaluation and support for teachers early in their careers .
Lengthening the probationary period before the award of tenure from three years to five or six years would provide more information both to novice teachers and to the Department of Education about these teachers ’ professional development and trajectories .
And a more differentiated evaluation system can help identify teachers ’ strengths and weaknesses , and assist them in deciding whether teaching in New York City schools will be a rewarding career .
Supporting New Teachers
Charles Merrill was a teacher and psychologist for the New York City Department of Education for 35 years .
He is currently writing a book about his teaching experiences .
There are strategies that do effectively eliminate incompetent teachers .
The article itself notes that 7 percent of new teachers were denied tenure last year and that 418 teachers left the system rather than go through the competency hearing process .
Some teachers assigned to the notorious “ rubber rooms ” resign or take early retirement .
So the education department ’s statement that only three teachers were fired is misleading .
Every new teacher should be assigned a mentor , who is available on a daily basis .
Even so , principals do give tenure to some teachers who should not teach .
Why ?
There are many reasons .
One may be that teachers are not always easy to replace .
A warm body may be better than nobody at the front of the room .
For example , the education department says it is now offering financial incentives to try to staff hard to fill math and science position in problem schools .
The best way to reduce the number of incompetent teachers is to raise teacher competency overall .
New teachers who are thrown into extremely difficult circumstances with little more than a “ good luck ” are likely to fail .
Read more …
Instead , every new teacher should be assigned a mentor , who is available on a daily basis .
Knowing the subject and how to present it , as well as mastering classroom management requires years of practice and training for most of us .
This is particularly true when many students come from backgrounds of chronic deprivation and neglect , including foster care , parental incarceration , living in shelters and more .
They require enormous patience and support .
In my first teaching assignment , I had a geometry class , with many students who were repeating the class .
There was chaos .
The next semester I taught algebra to a group of students who were in a special “ college bound ” program .
Suddenly I was a highly competent teacher .
What percentage of new teachers make it a career ?
Many new teachers leave after a few years as they realize how difficult educating children , particularly severely disadvantaged children , can be .
( Some have called Teach for America , with its high attrition rate , “ Teach for Awhile . ” )
The long - term solution is to recruit more highly educated , dedicated people into teaching , and to encourage them to stay in the profession .
Lastly , the article notes that there are only eight full time lawyers and eight part - time consultants in the unit dealing with incompetency cases .
To speed up the reviews , the department should triple that number .
The Unions ’ ‘ Plant ’ Mentality
Steve Perry is founder and principal of Capital Preparatory Magnet School in Hartford .
It ’s time for some plant closings .
While our teachers and principals prepare for lives in the suburbs , where their kids go to private or solid suburban schools , their students suffer from educational neglect , starved by the crumbs that they have been offered .
The teachers ’ unions have blamed poverty , race , Republicans , budgets , rain , sleet and snow for the failures of the last 30 years .
The American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association have created contentious industrial working conditions , replacing the artistry and professionalism of education with a “ plant ” mentality .
Since they want their members to be treated as if they work in a coal mine , where the conditions and the job are deplorable , then it ’s time that we respond in kind .
Every single person employed in a failed educational plant , from the lunch ladies to the principal , must be removed , period .
In their place we must employ a combination of public and private options .

The singing fish was designed by a British pet shop owner in Dallas Cutesy objects seemingly designed to separate us from our disposable income fill the UK 's gift shops .
Turn over the packaging and it is a sure bet that that quirky item reads " Made in China " .
Star turns in recent years include Nunzilla , the three - inch fire - breathing wind - up toy in the shape of a fearsome nun .
Or Dashboard Jesus , which wobbles when you stop and start in a traffic jam .
And one of the biggest successes has been the Billy Bass trophy mounted fish that sings , " Do n't worry , be happy " and drives us all nuts .
These products are marketing phenomena , in an industry now worth £ 23 bn ( $ 35 bn ) worldwide .
And China manufactures a whopping 60 % of these unnecessary purchases .
Just as the Japanese were once known for turning out cheap goods but learnt fast and ended up dominating the car and electrical markets , Chinese manufacturers are honing their skills with the giftware trade .
We used to manufacture everything in the UK .
What we found is that in China they seem to be much more open
Jude Biddulph , director Suck UK design consultancy However , China 's dominance of the novelty gift industry is relatively recent .
Malcolm Ford , head of UK - based Funtime Gifts , has been involved in the industry since 1970 .
" In those days everyone dealt initially with Japan , and then it shifted to Taiwan .
About 20 years ago it shifted to Hong Kong and 10 years ago it shifted to China . "
It was Ford who secured exclusive rights for Billy Bass when he first saw a prototype in a supplier 's showroom .
" I saw it and I could tell it was going to be a success , " he recalls .
' More open '
The creators of Mummy Mike , a little man -shaped rubber - band holder , are hoping for the same success .
It was conceived by design consultancy Suck UK in East London , produced in China and unveiled at the Birmingham Trade Fair earlier this year .
The product is inspired by the rubber - band balls common among office workers .
" What we wanted to do is to take that concept and give it a little more humour and personality , " explains Suck UK 's direct Jude Biddulph .
Factory workers in China where 60 % of novelty products are made
So why manufacture the product in China ?
" They are very good at very fine detail , " he says .
" We used to manufacture everything in the UK .
What we found is that in China they seem to be much more open about doing things that are completely new , or new to them .
" Whereas here they do n't want to try something different . "
In a factory in Xiamen , China , production manager Wenny Huang explains Mummy Mike 's production process .
" First of all , you have to make a mould .
" Once you get the mould with the right shape , you can encapsulate raw rubber into it .
" Under hot pressure , the raw material will be moulded into a product .
After that , to finish the product , the rough edges will have to be filed down . "
Capitalist culture Unsurprisingly , neither she nor any of her co-workers show much interest in buying Mummy Mike , or even understanding why anyone in their right minds would want to .
" We do n't need this , " says one worker of the Dashboard Jesus .
" I do n't have anywhere to put it  our apartments are rented . "
Perhaps a taste for " tat " signals an economy in the later stages of capitalism which finds solace in fits of giggles .
For the Chinese , with memories of deprivation rooted in centuries of foreign exploitation , imperial rule and civil wars , wasting money on trivia is serious business .
According to Jude Biddulph , better - off Chinese aspire to European goods .
He said the wealthy Chinese did buy British , but only expensive high - end pieces , not novelties .
" People want to buy into the brand , " he said of China .
Jude Biddulph ( r ) and Sam Hurt stopped using British manufacturers " There is extreme wealth , and they aspire to European brands and European - made products . "
While tiny but growing numbers of Chinese buy high - end goods , many of us stuck in post - recession UK shore up the giftware market by buying at the cheap end .
Malcolm
Ford says that in a recession people cut back on the " biggies " .
" They do n't feel as if they 're human if they 're not spending money on something . "
And this is where cheap amusing trinkets play their part .
Retail therapy really does make you feel good , albeit briefly .
Or would we be better off without it ?
Producing " stuff " for Western consumption generates a third of China 's carbon emissions .
The manufacturing of novelty products has moved from one country to another and it could move again as Chinese manufacturers begin to focus on other more lucrative industries .
For instance , my Apple Mac laptop and half my cosmetics , with their posh French labels , are now made in China .
Could that mean the Chinese one day losing interest in manufacturing our quirky gift ideas ?
Simon Collinson of Warwick University Business School said China 's industrial direction was already changing .
" As the Chinese get better at understanding what is needed in the West they will get better , not just at designing , but actually coming up with new innovations . "
China , Britain and the Nunzilla Conundrum can be heard on BBC Radio 4 at 1100 GMT on Friday 19 March and afterwards on BBC iPlayer

Don Draper is cornered , what does he do ?
Run of course , and run he did .
For the umpteenth time , Don was faced with a difficult decision and did n't know what else to do other than get the hell out .
There 's a catch : running does n't work all the time .
This time , something bad actually happened to him .
A twosome of crazy hitchhikers offer him phenobarbital which he accepts and ingests while driving .
I guess this is part of the different era part of the show .
I would never pick up hitchhikers especially at night , while Don would not only pick them up , but all take their drugs and go to a motel with them .
He ends up bloody and robbed , so maybe this is karma biting him in the ass for running off .
Who knows where he was going or what he was doing .
Either way , in the back of my brain , I was thinking " haha . "
The episode started differently with 3 different glimpses .
Peggy is in bed with someone , Betty is on a couch with a weird look on her face , and Don is lying flat on the ground at a hotel .
I think starting episodes like this either with a flashforward or in medias res is always cool to see when not overused .
It could be tempting for producers ( not the ones for this show ) to use it a little too much since the inherent effect is added mystery and expectations .
We can't believe how far Peggy has gone , from a secretary to copywriter , but she wants more .
Duck continues to court Peggy and Pete to work for Grey , sending them presents .
They agree to send them back though I would never send a free present back even if it was for sending a message .
After learning Don got the Hilton account , she ask to be on it and Don basically tells her " GTFO ! ! " ( in a somewhat more civil manner )
She meets with Duck to discuss the opening and asks to be copychief , but it 's clear that 's not happening .
Right when Peggy went to meet with Duck , it was pretty clear he was the one she would sleep with and it happened .
All you can do is shake your head .
I think this brings her at least one step closer to Grey , but hopefully Don can reel her back in before that happens .
The creepy pregnant woman belly feeler Henry Francis is back and the signals between he and Betty are pretty overt .
Betty is part of the Junior League who wants to do something about saving the environment , but Betty did n't really care and neither did I .
She uses this as an excuse to call Henry who agrees to meet with her and take a hike .
That does n't happen , but instead recommends a fainting couch which Betty buys later and spends her time fantasizing about him on .
Don 's reluctance to sign a contract most likely stems from the fact that signing his name would set in stone that fact that he is Don Draper and he works for Sterling - Cooper .
He is no longer the guy that can do whatever he wants and is now tied down .
He spends his time lashing out at people , and rather meanly I would add , running , and in the end , signing at 7-23-1963 .
I suppose it could mark the death of Dick Whitman as Alan Sepinwall stated though I did n't quite see it that way .
If Don really wanted to , he could still ignore the contract , rip it up , or do whatever deceitful thing Don does .
Sally 's teacher Ms. Farrell is back and Don is looking at her all the time .
There is an eclipse and the children are using cardboard boxes to look at it .
I think the implication is that everything is obscured like what the moon does to the sun in an solar eclipse .
Don has no clue what to do with the contract , Betty has no clue what to do with Henry , and Peggy has no clue what to do with Duck .
Score : 9.2/10

Welcome to another interview with a KDE contributor .
Last time we interviewed Marco Martin from KDE Plasma team , this time we talked with Tobias König from KDEPIM about Akonadi and the TV series Lost ;)
The original interview in Italian is available in Giovanni Venturi's KDE blog .
Tobias König Tobias König
Hello Tobias .
Can you introduce yourself to our readers ?
I ’m a 27 years old computer science student , living in Dresden , Germany .
In my spare time I develop free software and try to advocate Linux and KDE software .
When did you hear about KDE ?
The first time I read about KDE it was about version 1.0 Beta 4 in the German PC Magazine .
After having read the article multiple times I decided to wanted to be part of KDE .
Unfortunately I had neither a Linux installation nor knowledge of C++ development , only a Windows 95 PC and basic Pascal experience .
So I walked to the local book store , bought a RedHat distribution and a ‘ Learn C++ in 21 hours ’ book and that ’s where the journey started ... :)
How do you contribute to KDE ?
Most of the time I work on the KDEPIM project as maintainer of KAddressBook , however during the last months and years Akonadi , the desktop PIM service is my favorite project .
What is missing in KDE software ?
During the port from KDE 3 to Platform 4 we sacrificed the KPrinter framework in favor of using QPrinter , however the latter is missing most of the useful features that are necessary to make KDE software compelling for PC pools at universities or in companies .
This is really something that needs to be fixed !
What are the KDE applications that are doing a very good job ?
And any that perhaps need some love and extra help ?
I regularly use Konsole , Konqueror and Okular and they do a very good job IMHO :)
To the applications that need love and help I ’d count most of the KDEPIM applications , because we are still lacking developers in this area .
Especially after porting to Qt4 and Akonadi , there are many construction sites left where help is needed .
What do you think of KDE software on Windows and Mac OSX ?
Can the KDE community gain new KDE users and contributors this way ?
My full respect to the KDE on Windows and MacOS X guys , they are really doing a great and important job .
We are now ( or at least , very soon ; ) ) able to provide a complete office suite and PIM suite on all three major platforms , including mobile devices as fourth .
That ’s a killer feature when deploying software in companies or governmental institutions and this will strengthen the position of KDE software in the desktop world , be it on free or on non-free platforms .
Will Akonadi become a Free Desktop standard ?
Will it be used by other projects ?
We tried to apply to be a Free Desktop standard some months ago , however the Free Desktop project had ( or still has ? ) some internal problems with communication and decision making processes , therefor our application got stuck somewhere and we concentrated on hacking and improving the software instead .
Of course we hope that other projects ( like e.g. Mozilla Thunderbird , Gnome 's Evolution ) will make use of Akonadi as well , the major blocker so far is the missing Glib - Binding for the Akonadi access library .
If somebody with C and Glib knowledge wants to start on this project , we ’ll provide as much support as possible :)
What are your plans for the applications in the upcoming KDE PIM 4.5 release ?
For 4.5 we plan to have an Akonadi based KMail , KOrganizer and KJots ( maybe we 'll manage to get more PIM applications ported ) .
The basic porting is already done in SVN trunk , however we still need some time to iron out all the porting bugs and make use of the new possibilities that Akonadi provides us .
Next to the local address book , calendar and mail store we ’ll have support for the Kolab and Open - Xchange groupware servers and all other groupware servers that support the CalDAV or GroupDAV protocols .
My personal plans are to bring back some functionality in KAddressBook that people really missed in the 4.4 release .
What are the new features in Software Compilation 4 that you like and that you use every day ?
I really like the cover switch effect when switching between windows with Alt + Tab ;)
What is your favorite KDE application ?
There are several , however the KDE application that provides functionality that no other free software application provides in that way is definitely Okular .
What Linux distribution do you use ?
Debian unstable , that allows me to avoid compiling all the 3rd party libraries myself but still having up - to - date packages .
Are you being paid to develop for KDE ?
Partly , I did some small things for credativ GmbH but 99.9 % of my contributions were done in my spare time .
What motivates / keeps you motivated to work on KDE ?
Definitely the other contributors !
It ’s great to talk with people that share the same interests and working together with them towards the same goal .
Unfortunately during the last years we have more and more users that seem not to understand how Free Software works ... they send us irreverent emails out of frustration about issues they have with KDE applications .
They think we are some kind of paid support desk and do n’t understand that we do all the work for free in our spare time and therefor are not required to do whatever is so important in their opinion ... this is sad and very discouraging :(
If you could choose where to live what place you will choose and why ?
Some place in Scandinavia , Sweden or Norway , next to the sea .
Do n’t get me wrong , Dresden is a really nice city and it will always be part of my life ;) but the mentality and pragmatism in Scandinavia fits my understanding of a society much better than the current climate in Germany .
Have you ever stayed in Italy ?
If so , where ?
I have been in northern Italy for one day during a holiday in Austria several years ago ( 15 or so ) , unfortunately I ca n’t remember what the name of the place was ...
What ’s the last book you read ?
The Leopard , a Norwegian crime novel of my favorite author Jo Nesbø .
Have you ever followed the TV series Lost ?
No , just recently asked a friend about the plot :)
What do you think about it ?
How will it end ?
As far as I understood it is about an island that acts as a time machine ... so my guess is that the people living there will enter a time paradox and the creator of the island will die before he is born which will cause the series to never have existed in our parallel universe ;)
Thank you for your time Tobias and good luck with your many projects !
Breast cancer : Scientists have found a way to freeze breast tumours
And , in a major breakthrough , the “ ice - ball ” created around a tumour by the injections not only kills it off but ensures the cancer does not return .
Fine needles are used to inject the freezing gas around the tumour in a technique known as cryotherapy , which means the patient does not need invasive surgery and suffers no major discomfort .
CHELTENHAM FESTIVAL : GET YOUR FREE £ 100 BET HERE ...
The trial was carried out on 13 patients who had all refused to have breast operations to remove their tumours .
They remained cancer - free up to five years later when doctors saw no sign of the disease returning and noted no significant complications .
Dr Peter Littrup , interventional radiologist at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit , who led the study , said the findings suggested freezing tumours was both safe and effective .
“ Minimally invasive cryotherapy opens the door for a potential new treatment for breast cancer and needs to be further tested , ” he said .
“ When used for local control and – or – potential cure of breast cancer , it provided safe and effective breast conservation . ”
Although cryotherapy has been used by surgeons for years to treat disease , it always used to require a major operation .
But the invention of tiny needles has allowed radiologists to start using the process .
Studies have already shown that it can help kill off prostate tumours , although it is still not recommended for widespread NHS use .
In the latest experiment , cancer cells are destroyed within minutes of the injections and the patient suffers little pain or scarring .
The study was presented at the Society of Interventional Radiology ’s 35th Annual Scientific Meeting in Florida yesterday .
The team followed the 13 patients for five years – the length of time in which patients should not suffer a relapse in order for a treatment to be classed as effective .
More than 45,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK .
Most are given surgery to remove either the tumour or the entire breast .
This is followed by weeks of radiotherapy , chemotherapy and various drug treatments depending on the type of breast cancer .
More than 80 per cent of women diagnosed with breast cancer will survive for at least five years using these treatments and more than 70 per cent will survive for a decade .
In recent years , radiologists have been looking at a number of new ways in which they can “ intervene ” in diseases using a range of procedures .
These doctors , known as interventional radiologists , have tested techniques including “ heating ” tumours with lasers and radiation .
Last night , breast cancer charities welcomed the new study , but said it was far too early to say if the technique would ever be available to all patients .
Dr Caitlin Palframan , from Breakthrough Breast Cancer , said : “ We are a long way away from knowing whether cryotherapy has potential as a treatment option .
Where appropriate , surgery remains a gold - standard treatment and surgical techniques continue to improve all the time . ”
EXCLUSIVE : Buck Rogers , the fighter pilot who wakes up in the 25th Century , is being relaunched as a 3D screen hero .
Paul WS Anderson has locked a deal to direct a new version of the classic tale of a fighter pilot who quickly acclimates to the future and puts his skills to use defending the planet against invaders .
The character launched in the 1920s and has been the subject of comic books , radio and movie serials , and two TV series , the latter of which ran on NBC and starred Gil Gerard .
Iron Man scribes Art Marcum and Matt Holloway will write the screenplay .
The Buck Rogers rights are controlled by Paradox , the company behind a new version of Conan the Barbarian that is currently shooting in Bulgaria with Marcus Nispel directing Jason Momoa in a Nu Image / Millennium Films production .
Paradox will finance the Buck Rogers development , and Anderson ’s longtime partner , Jeremy Bolt , is producing with Fredrik Malmberg , with Larry Abramson and George Furla .
They will lock in financing when they lock a script , though buyers have been aware of the project since it started getting talked up during last year ’s Cannes Film Festival .
It is one of the few branded properties that has n’t been gobbled up by a studio .
Anderson , who is working on another classic property with a new version of The Three Musketeers –Constantin is financing , Summit is North American distributor and international sales agent , and Anderson is casting for a fall shoot –has a knack for launching films that go back for repeat installments .
That includes Resident Evil , Aliens Vs. Predators , and most most recently a remake of Death Race , a second installment of which is now in production .
ICM repped Anderson and the writers .
It looks like Hot or Not just got nexted .
The new shiny of the moment , Chatroulette , soundly trounced the older site in this week 's edition of the long - running Web Faceoff series .
At 742 votes , Chatroulette commanded 66 % of the vote , more than twice the 281 votes Hot or Not netted to stake out its 25 % of the total .
The tie vote occupied 9 % of the total .
I guess Ben Folds , Merton and the 14 % pervert demographic can't be wrong .
Were you at all surprised by the results ?

Danae : Hi , Lars ...
What 's up ?
Lars :
Oh , not much ...
Just out to continue my research on how your species handles its economic crisis .
Danae : Why ?
It sounds really boring .
Lars :
We went through the same thing on our planet , so we 're curious to see what solution humans come up with .
Danae : Oh ...
How'd you guys solve it ?
Lars : Hop in , I 'll show you .

Once is an anomaly , but twice is a trend .
But what is funny about this trend of anti-choicers crying censorship is how ridiculous the whining sounds from them .
This is the religious right .
They love censorship !
Once is an anomaly , but twice is a trend .
First you have Focus on Family playing the victims of “ censorship ” attempts by feminists trying to get an anti-choice ad off the air because it violated CBS ’s long history of not airing advocacy ads , and now you have the dishonestly named Feminist for Life sending out a press release decrying censorship of ads at the University of Victoria , under that university ’s rules against student clubs harassing other students .
I ’m not a big fan of censorship and probably think it ’s a bad idea in this case , but it ’s also disingenuous of Serrin Foster to pretend that the ads are simply highlighting , to quote the press release , “ resources and support . ”
If you click the link , you can see that in fact the ads accuse pro-choicers and the one in three American women who will have an abortion in their lives of doing so out of hatred for cute babies and disabled people .
So , it ’s definitely harassment , though of course the sort that I think should be protected speech .
But what is funny about this trend of anti-choicers crying censorship is how ridiculous the whining sounds from them .
This is the religious right .
You know ?
The people who spend millions on direct mail campaigns to harass the FCC into censoring sexual stuff on TV , the people for whom Banned Books
Week was created to resist , the folks who pushed abstinence - only education , which is based on the idea that we should censor information about safer sex practices on the grounds that those who do n’t know wo n’t do ?
They do n’t have some philosophical objection to censorship .
They love censorship !
Free speech is a liberal value !
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .

Well , exactly .
What they ’re doing here is creating a wedge issue — using a group ’s own values against it in order to sow dissent and confusion .
As the anti-choice movement has not done a good job garnering support either under blatant anti-sex arguments or through disingenuous concern for fetal life , they ’re increasingly putting their resources into developing and advertising these wedge issues .
Censorship is only the newest one .
In fact , Feminists for Life are pioneers of this strategy — using faux concern for women ’s well - being to suggest that we ban abortion for women ’s own good ( since we ’re just too dumb to make our own decisions , which is not a feminist position ) — and as such , this specific ad campaign is a perfect storm of anti-choice wedge issues .
The ads use only black models , invoking the insulting “ black eugenics ” claim .
Foster ’s claim that the harassing ads are about “ support and resources ” refers to FFL ’s claim that the proper feminist position is depriving women of rights but giving them diapers for those unwanted babies .
And the use of a model in a wheelchair employs the anti-choice wedge tactic of hijacking disability rights to argue against a woman ’s right to choose .
Of course , the great “ concern ” that anti-choicers show for women , disabled people , and black people is an inch deep , stopping right at the point that this concern ca n’t be used to beat pro-choicers over the head and sow confusion .
Attempts to shut down Planned Parenthood in communities of color are n’t accompanied by attempts to replace the badly - needed reproductive health services that Planned Parenthood supplies — and sometimes is the only supplier of in a community .
For all that Sarah Palin claims to speak for disabled people , her support begins and ends with opposing abortion , but does n’t encompass any actual measures that would improve the lives of people living with disabilities outside of the womb .
In many cases , anti-choicers fight actual efforts to help disabled people , as you see with this threatened boycott of the March of Dimes .
Stated concerns about women ’s mental health and well - being do n’t translate into any anti-choice activism against the real causes of women ’s distress .
In fact , anti-choicers often belong to religious groups that encourage the kind of sexism that keeps women in bad marriages or from fulfilling their own desires , and leads them to depression .
And now that they ’ve picked up anti-censorship as a cause , we can guess anti-choicers are n’t going to demand that CBS stop censoring pro-gay ads any time soon .
The shallow nature of these wedge issues leads one to ask what their value is .
Are any liberals “ chipped off ” with these strategies ?
There might be a few , but I do n’t think that ’s the major value of wedge issues for the anti-choice movement .
Instead , wedge issues are there to sow confusion in the mainstream media and to embolden the base .
That anti-choicers are able to get “ muddy the waters ” type of stories — like this one about the claims of eugenics — should just be a reminder of how much the mainstream media has abandoned their duty to get the facts on record , and instead employ a “ he said / she said ” narrative .
Facts - based journalism would ask who here is really doing the hard work of improving the lives of people of color , and the results would not favor anti-choicers .
Laziness and cowardice in the mainstream media makes the wedge issue a viable option , and helps conceal the ugly nature of the anti-choice movement from the less politically plugged in public .
But these wedge issues are also about emboldening the base .
The overt sadism of being anti-choice conflicts with a lot of people ’s self - image as good people , so if they ’re sold rationalizations about how they ’re the good guys , they ’re going to cling to those rationalizations , no matter how thin .
For conservatives , the opportunity to avoid real advocacy for women , people of color , and disabled people while pretending to do those things while actually oppressing people is just too tasty to refuse .
Plus , it achieves the most important goal of all : annoying the liberals .
Bad faith arguments about racism or disability advocacy can be put on liberals , who then have to spend their time refuting your lies .
Certainly , I get more taunts from anti-choicers on Twitter about these bad faith wedge issue arguments than any other factor ; there ’s a sadistic delight in being full of it and putting someone else in a situation where they feel they have to correct the record for the good of the nation .
' I'm proud of using waterboarding to break terrorists , ' declares Bush 's top political adviser
Defiant : Karl Rove claimed that waterboarding had saved lives
George W Bush 's top political adviser has said he was ' proud ' of controversial techniques such as waterboarding , which he claimed broke the will of terrorist .
Karl Rove - known as the former president 's ' brain ' - said he did not believe that the interrogation method amounted to torture .
In an interview with the BBC , he claimed that waterboarding - which simulates drowning - had helped prevent terrorist attacks .
' I'm proud that we used techniques that broke the will of these terrorists and gave us valuable information that allowed us to foil plots , ' he said .
' I am proud that we kept the world safer than it was by the use of these techniques .
They are appropriate , they are in conformity with our international requirements and with US law . '
Asked if he believed waterboarding was torture , he said : ' No , it 's not .
People need to read the memos that outline what was permissible and not permissible before they make a judgement about these things . '
' Every one of the people who were waterboarded had a doctor who had to ascertain that there had been no long - lasting physical or mental damage to the individual , ' he said .
The senior Republican aide and Bush 's deputy chief of staff said in the Newsnight interview that subjects had told they would not drown before they underwent the procedure .
He insisted terror plots had been prevented by the tough interrogation , citing flying planes into Heathrow and London , bringing down aircraft over the Pacific and flying an aircraft into the tallest tower in Los Angeles .
Human rights activists demonstrate waterboarding on a volunteer in Washington
Mr Rove has recently published his memoir , Courage And Consequence , and in it he defends the Bush regime as ' impressive , durable and significant ' .
Earlier this week , the former head of MI5 Baroness Eliza Manningham - Buller said that U.S intelligence agencies deliberately concealed their mistreatment of terror suspects .
She said she had only learnt that 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been waterboarded - a total of 160 times - after retiring from the Security Service in 2007 .
Ex -MI5 head Lady Manningham - Buller said members of Bush 's team may have been inspired by on - screen excess in the TV series ' 24 ' , starring Kiefer Sutherland ( above ) .
Mr Rove said the comment was ' laughable '
When asked on Newsnight if U.S. intelligence had told their British counterparts about their methods , Mr Rove said he did not know and would have to ' defer to intelligence officials ' .
But he added : ' I suspect since we were sharing that information with the Democratic and Republican leaders of committees that there was widespread knowledge in the intelligence committees of this information and its source . '
In her speech to the Mile End Group at the House of Lords , Lady Manningham - Buller also joked that members of U.S. President George W. Bush 's administration , including Vice President Dick Cheney and Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , may have been inspired by on - screen excess .
' One of the sad things is Cheney , Rumsfeld and Bush all watched " 24 " , ' Lady Manningham - Buller said , referring to the popular TV show about a counter - terrorist agent , starring Kiefer Sutherland .
But Mr Rove said this was ' laughable ' .
He said President Bush rarely watched TV apart from sport and that Mr Cheney while a fan of 24 ' is fully capable of distinguishing between fact and fiction ' .
Barack Obama banned waterboarding shortly after his inauguration in Janaury 2009 .
The technique had been sanctioned in a series of memos compiled by lawyers working for Bush in August 2002 .
Crucially , the documents laid out the legal provision for its use thus giving immunity to the state employees who carried it out .
Some of the memos were released last year .
There have been a number of high profile detainees who were subjected to the technique , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks .
Pressure : Binyam Mohamed , left , and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , right , were both waterboarded
He was waterboarded on more than 160 separate occasions .
Briton Binyam Mohamed , who was held at Guantanamo Bay , was also waterboarded .
Lady Manningham - Buller said earlier this week she had wondered how the US had been able to supply the UK with intelligence from Mohammed .
' I said to my staff , ' Why is he talking ? ' because our experience of Irish prisoners , Irish terrorists , was that they never said anything , ' she said .
' They said , well , the Americans say he is very proud of his achievements when questioned about it .
' It was n't actually until after I retired that I read that , in fact , he had been waterboarded 160 times .
Co-author Rep. Tom Perreillo ( D - VA ) to Insurance Companies : " Be afraid , be very afraid ... "
A positive step in the right direction :
By a vote of 406 - 19 , the House passed the Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act ( HR 4626 ) , introduced by Reps. Tom Perriello ( D - VA ) and Betsy Markey ( D - CO ) .
This bill is designed to restore competition and transparency to the health insurance market – by repealing the blanket antitrust exemption afforded to health insurance companies by the McCarran - Ferguson Act of 1945 .
Under this legislation , health insurers will no longer be shielded from legal accountability for price fixing , dividing up territories among themselves , sabotaging their competitors in order to gain monopoly power , and other such anti-competitive practices .
Over the last several years , the health insurance industry has become increasingly concentrated –giving consumers fewer and fewer meaningful choices in shopping for health insurance .
According to a recent study by the AMA , there have been more than 400 mergers among health insurers in the past 14 years . [..]
This bill is also necessary because , over the years , health insurers have been able to use this antitrust exemption to block court actions regarding anti-competitive behavior .
In Ocean State Physicians Health Plan , Inc. v Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island , the First Circuit Court – citing the McCarran - Ferguson antitrust exemption – overturned a jury verdict against the dominant health insurer for using its monopoly power to put financial pressure on area employers to refuse to do business with a competing HMO .
There is also evidence that removing this antitrust exemption will result in lower prices and other benefits for consumers .
Time and time again , increased competition results in lower prices , increased choice , and greater innovation .
A healthy and competitive health insurance market will drive prices down in the health insurance industry , just as we have seen it do in so many other industries where competition is allowed to take hold .
Since California passed a law in 1988 that eliminated the state antitrust exemption for the auto insurance industry , for instance , auto premiums for consumers in California have risen by 9.8 % while the rest of the country has seen auto premiums rise by over 48 % .
One of the world ’s most popular pesticides , atrazine , chemically castrates male frogs and in some instances changes them into completely functionally females , according to a new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The authors conclude that atrazine likely plays a large , but unsuspected role in the current global amphibian crisis .
To study how atrazine impacts frogs , researchers studied the long - term effects of the pesticide on an all - male group forty of African clawed frogs ( Xenopus laevis ) .
Even though they exposed the frogs to a low doze ( 2.5 parts per billion , i.e. ppb ) of the pesticide , the researchers found that 10 percent of the animals became full - fledged females due to exposure to the pesticide , capably even of breeding successfully with males .
The other 90 percent of the exposed males were demasculinized , suffering from decreased testosterone , low fertility , and an inability to outcompete non-exposed males in breeding .
Two males copulating .
The larger animal on the bottom ( though genetically male ) has been completely feminized by atrazine exposure and produces viable eggs .

“ The impacts of atrazine on amphibians and on wildlife in general are potentially devastating , ” the authors write .
“ The negative impacts on wild amphibians is especially concerning given that the dose examined here ( 2.5 ppb ) is in the range that animals experience year - round in areas where atrazine is used , well within levels found in rainfall , in which levels can exceed 100 ppb in the Midwestern United States , and below the current US Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standard of 3 ppb . ”
According to the paper : “ atrazine is the most commonly detected pesticide contaminant of ground , surface , and drinking water ” due to its popularity .
Eighty million pounds are used annually in the United States alone with rainfall spreading the pesticide far beyond its application point .
Worldwide amphibians are in decline : at least one third of the world ’s amphibians are currently threatened with extinction , and researchers estimate that over 120 amphibian species have gone extinct in just thirty years .
While scientists have paid a lot of attention to particular threats such as habitat loss , climate change , and a fungal disease that is known to wipe - out whole amphibian populations , far less attention has been given to the possible role of pesticides , like atrazine .
“ The present study suggests several ways that exposure to endocrine disruptors such as atrazine may lead to population level effects in the wild and contribute to amphibian declines , ” the researchers write .
“ Certainly , the inability to compete for females and the significant decline in fertility in exposed males , as reported in the present study , will have a direct impact on exposed populations . ”
In addition , male frogs that become wholly female due to the pesticide can only in - turn produce male young .
The researchers say that mathematic modeling proves such a situation could lead to the eventual extinction of an entire species .
But it ’s not just amphibian survival that is at stake , past studies have shown atrazine to be a potent endocrine disrupter in fish , reptiles , birds , rodents , and even human cell lines .
Atrazine was banned in the EU in 2004 , but remains widely used in the US and around the world .

Scientists uncover mystery of how frog plague kills its victims
( 10/22/2009 )
One hundred and twenty species of frogs are reported to have gone extinct since 1980 ( although the number is likely even higher ) .
While devastated by habitat loss , pollution , and climate change , a baffling disease may be the biggest factor behind the alarming extinctions of frogs .
Called chytridiomycosis , the disease is caused by the microscopic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis which kills its tiny victims indiscriminately .
Freshwater species worse off than land or marine
( 10/15/2009 ) Scientists have announced that freshwater species are likely the most threatened on earth .
Extinction rates for freshwater inhabitants are currently four to six times the rates for terrestrial and marine species .
Yet , these figures have not lead to action on the ground .
Save the frogs , save ourselves
( 09/04/2009 ) Amphibians are going extinct around the globe .
As a scientist specializing in frogs , I have watched dozens of species of these creatures die out .
The extinction of frogs and salamanders might seem unimportant , but the reality could n’t be farther from the truth .
Indeed , from regulating their local ecosystems , to consuming and controlling the population of mosquitoes and other insects that spread disease , to potentially pointing the way to new drugs for fighting diseases such as cancer or HIV - AIDS , the fate of these creatures is inexorably linked to our own .
Amphibians could develop immunity against devastating fungal disease
( 04/03/2009 )
The fungal disease chytridiomycosis has ravaged amphibian populations , including contributing to several extinctions .
But new research may bring some hope for currently threatened amphibians .
Salamander populations collapse in Central America
( 02/09/2009 ) Salamanders in Central America — like frogs , toads , and other amphibians at sites around the world — are rapidly and mysteriously declining , report researchers writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Disturbingly , salamanders are disappearing from protected areas and otherwise pristine habitats .
One billion frogs harvested as food per year

The consumption of up to one billion frogs per year to satisfy human appetite for frog flesh is adding to the litany of pressures on global amphibian populations , write researchers in the upcoming issue of Conservation Biology .
( 12/01/2008 ) The Neotropics harbor between 30 - 50 % of the world ’s reptiles and amphibians , but dramatic declines in both groups have been observed over recent decades .
While a number of factors have been cited , many of the causes of reptile and amphibian declines are still poorly understood .
The situation is paralleled by a lack of information of the natural history , ecology , and behavior of many species .
New hope of curing amphibian plague
( 11/28/2008 ) Amphibians worldwide are in trouble .
One of the most endangered animal groups , amphibians are increasingly threatened by habitat loss , pollution , and climate change .
However the largest threat is chytridiomycosis , a devastating disease caused by a parasitic chytrid fungus known as Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , otherwise known as Bd .
Scientists can’t explain cause of amphibian extinction crisis
( 11/13/2008 ) Scientists have yet to conclusively explain the underlying cause of global declines in amphibian populations , according to a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The research says that two leading theories for the demise of amphibians — both related to the emergence and spread of the deadly chytrid fungus — are not supported by scientific data .
The Natural History Museum has one of the world 's greatest collections , capturing the earth 's huge biodiversity .
Ahead of a major new BBC TV series – Museum of Life – six members of their world - class team of 300 scientists each pick a treasure
The statistics defy comprehension .
The mammal collection on its own contains 860,000 items , ranging from the skeleton of a blue whale to a dormouse .
Yet this array of old bones and fur represents a mere slice of the contents of the Natural History Museum .
Over the three acres of storage space that forms a labyrinth around the museum in South Kensington , London , there are rooms that contain the remains of 58 million animals , drawers of five million pressed plants , and cupboards filled with nine million fossils .
For good measure , this magnificent terracotta edifice – designed by Alfred Waterhouse and opened in 1881 – also provides a home for 300,000 rocks and minerals as well as 2,000 meteorites .
This , quite simply , is one of the planet 's most important natural history collections , a repository of the biological and geological wonders that have appeared on earth over its 4.6 billion - year history .
Yet only a tiny minority of these marvels is ever seen by the public .
The rest are kept behind the scenes at the museum , although these artefacts are still of tremendous importance to researchers , as a new BBC2 TV series , Museum of Life , intends to show .
Six documentaries examine some of the star specimens among the museum 's scientific treasures and will demonstrate how they are being used as tools to understand , and improve , the planet 's threatened ecology .
Thus we will learn of the importance of giant tortoise excrement to the regeneration of the ebony forests of Mauritius and come to understand the usefulness of making moulds of dinosaur skeletons .
As Richard Fortey , one of the museum 's most important palaeontologists , explains : " The golden rule of museum life is simple .
Do n't throw anything away .
You never know – a technique or technology could come into existence and reveal a new scientific use for it . "
As to the identity of the greatest treasures to be found within the walls of this scientific Hogwarts , there is , inevitably , disagreement .
So the Observer asked some of the museum 's personnel to name their favourites and explain why they have selected them .
Of course , opinions change over time and future generations will no doubt take a very different view – a point demonstrated by the museum 's own walls .
Waterhouse stipulated there should be carved images of living species on the west wing 's walls while the east would only have those of extinct creatures .
These included the coelacanth , then thought to be extinct , but which was discovered , very much alive , in 1934 .
As a result the coelacanth now finds itself commemorated on the wrong wall .
Museum of Life starts on Thursday
The diplodocus

" It is hard to believe that the great skeleton of Dippy , our fossil diplodocus , has not always dominated the museum 's entrance hall .
The two look as if they had been made for each other : a vast cathedral - like space filled by that wonderful 26 m - long skeleton of a long - extinct dinosaur .
It is a sight that never fails to hypnotise youngsters when they first set foot in the museum .
" Yet we were without Dippy for the first 24 years of our existence .
Indeed , it might never have ended up here at all had not King Edward VII asked for a copy of the newly discovered dinosaur when he visited the Carnegie Museum in America .
Over the next 18 months , casts of the fossilised bones were made from five different diplodocus skeletons and shipped to Britain in 36 crates .
Dippy was assembled and formally introduced to the public on 12 May , 1905 , in the reptile gallery before ending up in the great hall in 1979 .
" He has also changed over the years .
For a long time we reckoned the diplodocus must have lumbered about in swamps because its body would have been too heavy to move about on dry land and would have needed water or mud for support .
However , our ideas about sauropod dinosaurs have changed and we now believe they were much more dynamic and active than we had thought .
So we have raised Dippy 's head and also his tail , which would have acted as a counterbalance .
Essentially , though , he is the same old Dippy that has entranced visitors to the museum for more than 100 years . "
The Nakhla meteorite

" There are about 38,000 meteorites in museum and private collections in the world but this one is special because it's one of only a handful that are known to have come from another planet : Mars .
About 12 m years ago an asteroid or comet crashed on to Mars .
The resulting blast blew pieces of rock into space and into orbit round the Sun .
Then , in 1911 , the Earth passed through that orbit and swept up some of those pieces of rock and these fell over the Nakhla area of Egypt .
There was a fireball , a detonation and then a shower of stones .
Locals claimed a dog was killed – which would have made the animal the only known victim of an interplanetary attack .
However , the story is pretty suspect .
" The piece , which is a star specimen in our vault gallery , has a beautiful shiny black exterior .
This is known as a fusion crust and was created by the intense heat of the meteorite 's fiery passage through the atmosphere .
Its interior is mostly a mixture of iron and magnesium silicates called pyroxene and olivine .
Some scientists say they can see signs of fossil bacteria - like entities in the meteorite but I am not convinced .
On the other hand , it is now clear some of that the minerals that make up the meteorite could only have been created in the presence of water .
This shows that Mars – at least in the distant past – must have been a wet , fairly hospitable place . "
Archaeopteryx

Angela Milner , research associate in the palaeontology department
" Archaeopteryx has unique , iconic importance for a very simple reason : it is a perfect example of evolution in action .
It looks half - way between a bird and a small meat - eating dinosaur which , of course , is exactly what it is .
" It was found inside a piece of limestone in southern Germany and brought in 1862 to the museum , where Thomas Huxley recognised it is a transitional fossil that links modern birds with dinosaurs .
Thus it became a key piece of evidence in the debate about natural selection .
Our specimen is 147 m years old and is the earliest known fossil of an animal that we can definitely call a bird .
In other words , its lineage had only relatively recently evolved from dinosaur predecessors .
It is wonderfully preserved despite the age , however .
You can see its feathers in perfect detail .
" Archaeopteryx would have been about the size of a magpie and would have had a long tail like a magpie's .
However , in its case this tail was made out of bone .
Since then , birds have evolved tails that are made out of feathers .
Intriguingly , we actually have two versions of this particular archaeopteryx .
It was preserved in a slab of lithographic limestone which was split apart to reveal the bird inside .
" Both sides reveal detailed impressions of the bird .
A copy of one is displayed in the earth gallery and another in the bird gallery . "
The Broken Hill Skull

" This is a beautifully preserved skull of an early human being who we think lived about 300,000 years ago .
It is also a fossil of special historical importance .
In the 19th century , Charles Darwin had predicted science would show that the origins of humanity lay in Africa .
But for the next 50 years the only fossils dug up were in Europe and Asia .
The Broken Hill Skull – which was found in a mine in Zambia ( then Rhodesia ) in 1921 - changed that perspective and helped show our birthplace is , indeed , an African one .
It has personal importance as well .
When I saw a replica of the skull in the museum when I was a youngster , I was captivated , and decided , there and then , to study evolution .
" The skull of Broken Hill Man – we believe it is male from its size – was coated in ore when it was dug up .
However , the huge brow - ridges over its eyes marked it out as special and it was sent to the museum .
Today we now believe it belongs to a species called Homo heidelbergensis : big - brained , powerfully built hunter - gatherers who may also have been our direct ancestors .
" The skull – a replica is displayed in our human evolution gallery - also reveals clear evidence of illness among ancient people .
It has a hole at the back which was probably caused by a small tumour or brain abscess which burst through the skull wall .
However , to judge from the subsequent bone growth around the hole , this appears to have partly healed .
" In fact , it is more likely his teeth killed Broken Hill Man .
These , and his upper jawbone , were riddled with abscesses that would have caused him immense pain and may even have led to the spread of a fatal infection . "
The arapaima fish

" When I was young I was fascinated by the aquarium at London zoo and , in particular , by the tank that contained marine creatures from the Amazon .
There was one fish , called the arapaima , which I thought was especially exciting .
It was huge , around two metres , and looked truly spectacular .
" Then one day I found the tank had been closed and was being cleaned out .
I never found out what happened to the arapaima – until I went to work for the Natural History Museum .
There I came across a specimen preserved in alcohol .
It was only when I checked the label that I discovered it had come from the zoo .
It was , in fact , the very fish that had drawn me to the aquarium a decade earlier and begun my fascination with marine biology .
The arapaima seems to have haunted my life .
" In fact , it is a really intriguing fish – not just because of its unusual size .
For example , the adult arapaima looks after its young by keeping a shoal of them in its mouth to protect them .
The fish is also rare in that it breathes oxygen from the water - and from the air .
" Unfortunately , the arapaima is easily harpooned because of its size and because it swims near the surface .
As a result , it is suffering a serious loss of numbers in the wild .
On the other hand , it is also being bred today in fish farms .
I doubt if I could eat one though . "
Darwin's pigeon

" Charles Darwin collected many bird specimens on his voyage on the Beagle .
However , his research had only just begun when he returned to Britain in 1836 .
Still seeking evidence years later , he began studying domestic animals – and the pigeon turns out to be a surprising favourite .
Darwin brought together many different breeds of the bird – which helped to demonstrate the general point that a wide variety of animals can be created from a single originating type .
Between 1855 and 1858 , Darwin devoted a large part of his time to pigeon breeding – just as fellow scientists , such as Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker , were pressing him to publish his ideas about evolution .
Just write something - ' pigeons , if you please ' - but make sure you get your theory into print , Lyell urged .
" Then , in 1858 , Darwin got a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace outlining his own version of natural selection , and he dropped everything to write On The Origin of Species .
Crucially , this includes many observations about domestic animals – including the pigeon .
Later Darwin left his pigeon specimens to the museum and these have turned out to be some of the best preserved items in all his collections .
My favourite is a skeleton that has been carefully labelled , in Darwin 's own handwriting , and dates back to 1856 , just when his ideas about natural selection were crystallising .
It is not on permanent display but it is usually included in most , behind - the - scenes tours of the museum . "

While surfing the interwebs , I ran across an article written by Bruce Mckean of the Dailymercury.com.au .
It seems a fellow Trek Fan got into a bit of trouble for fighting in the town square of Mackay , in Queensland Australia .
Apparently fan Nathan Lewis had been out all night with his other Trek friends and had taken some guff for wearing his uniform out on the town .
From what I can gather , he apparently gave his antagonist a few punches and possibly a Kirk style two - legged jump kick before police intervened .
What 's even more interesting about this story is that it made the national news in Australia , simply because Nathan was wearing a Star Trek uniform .
Not only that , but the article pokes fun at Nathan and the situation due to his love of Trek .
I guess even with the success of the new movie , it 's still going to be difficult for us to escape the stigma of Trek fandom .
Kudos to Nathan for showing that Gorn the business end of his foot .
Check out the article excerpt below .
NATHAN Lewis was dressed in a Star Trek outfit when he was caught fighting in Mackay ’s main street .
So when he got into a spot of turbulance in the Magistrate ’s Court yesterday we fully expected him to say : “ Beam me up Scotty . ”
Or he could have sent a message to Captain James T. Kirk or Doctor Spock for help .
The USS Enterprise may yet even fly the whole Star Trek crew in to fight for him .
Mr Lewis was in a Star Trek outfit and he was seen by police to violently punch another man in the head .
Obviously an alien .
The alien , cleverly disguised as a male human being , then punched the Star Trek man .
Police intervened at warp speed and reported to mission control that no - one was injured and no complaints had been made .
Mr Lewis told police he ’d been out all night dressed up in fancy dress as a Star Trek character .
He pleaded guilty yesterday to creating a public nuisance .
Duty solicitor Sheena Hayes , of S.R. Wallace and Wallace , said the other man involved in the fight had been giving Mr Lewis and another of his Star Trek crew a hard time all night because of their costumes .
The Universal Peacemaker ( Magistrate Damien Dwyer ) set the case down for a disputed sentence hearing later this month .
So we could be hearing from Capt Kirk and Dr Spock after all .

By the way Bruce , it 's Mr. Spock not Dr. Spock .

A student who was pictured urinating over a war memorial has been warned that he could face jail after pleading guilty to outraging public decency .
Sheffield Hallam University student Philip Laing , 19 , from Macclesfield , Cheshire , was photographed following a drinking session in Sheffield .
He was charged after the picture appeared on the Daily Mail website .
A judge , adjourning the case until 26 November , said his actions would have caused " distress , shock and sadness " .
District Judge Anthony Browne told Laing , who appeared in court wearing a poppy on his dark suit , that all options were open , including custody .
He said : " The image of you urinating over the poppy wreath on the war memorial in this city will make most people turn away in disgust , shock and sadness .
" It has undoubtedly distressed and upset many .
The war memorial is a sacred and special place . "
It 's difficult to articulate just how embarrassed and ashamed this young man is
Tim Hughes , mitigating
The court heard that Laing , a sports technology student , had drunk a bottle of whisky before attending an organised student drinking session .
District Judge Browne criticised Carnage UK , the private company that organised the event .
" Carnage is the name of the organisation who promote this type of activity and some might say that somebody should be standing alongside you this morning , " he said .
The court heard Laing had no recollection of the events of the night of 11 October until he was contacted by the university press office and shown the photograph , which later appeared on the newspaper 's website .
Ian Conway , prosecuting , said Laing had immediately admitted the offence when arrested and told police he was " very , very drunk , the drunkest I 've ever been since I 've been at university " .
Mr Conway said : " The disgusting and reprehensible act the defendant carried out was in no way premeditated , targeted or politically motivated .
" His actions were sadly the result of having consumed large amounts of alcohol . "
In mitigation , Tim Hughes said his client was " a young man caught up in a culture of drinking far too much and as a result of that this is what has occurred " .
He added that Laing 's grandparents had fought in the war and said the defendant had learned his lesson .
" It 's difficult to articulate just how embarrassed and ashamed this young man is . "
The case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports and Laing was released on bail .
In a statement following the hearing , Varsity Leisure Group ( VLG ) said : " VLG , owner of the Carnage UK brand , does not promote the commission of criminal offences .
" It is highly defamatory of if to suggest that it does . "

For the festival named for him , see Billy Bowlegs Festival .
William Augustus Bowles ( 1763 -1805 ) , also known as Estajoca and traditionally as Billy Bowlegs , was a Maryland - born English adventurer who served with the Maryland Loyalists Battalion as an ensign during the American Revolution , having joined the British Army as a foot solider at fourteen .
By 1777 he was an ensign in the British Navy , with which he sailed to Jamaica and later Pensacola , but was stripped of his rank for insubordination and dereliction of duty .
He left Pensacola with a group of Creek Indians , but returned in 1779 and fought with British forces against Bernardo de Gàlvez during the 1781 Siege of Pensacola .
In his life among the Indians , Bowles married two wives : one Cherokee and other Creek .
His Creek wife was the chief 's daughter , making him heir to Creek chiefdom .
Pursuing his idea of an American Indian state after the end of the war , he was received by George III as ' Chief of the Embassy for Creek and Cherokee Nations . '
With British funding , he returned to the Bahamas to train Creek Braves as pirates to attack Spanish ships .
A furious Spain offered $ 6,000 and 1,500 kegs of rum for his capture , and when he finally was captured he was transported to Madrid where he was unmoved by the King of Spain 's attempts to make him change sides .
He then escaped , commandeering a ship and returning to the Gulf of Mexico .
In 1795 along with the Seminoles , he formed a short - lived state in northern Florida known as the " State of Muskogee " , with himself as its president , and in 1800 declared war on Spain .
In 1803 , not long after having declared himself ' Chief of all Indians present ' at a trial council , he was betrayed and turned over to the Spanish .
He died in prison in Havana two years later , having refused to eat .
The Billy Bowlegs Festival , celebrated annually in Fort Walton Beach , is named for him .

Chomsky on Cognitive Science , and Anarchism
Noam Chomsky interviewed by Reddit Blog
Reddit Blog , March 12 , 2010
Q : Do you currently see an elephant room of cognitive science , just like you named one 50 years ago — I guess that ’s a reference to my critique of radical behaviorism — something that needs addressing that gets too little attention ?
NC : Well , one thing that I think gets too little attention in the room of cognitive science is cognitive science .
Most of the work that ’s done just does n’t seem to me to bear on cognitive science .
I could pick up a couple of journals here and give examples .
Cognitive science ought to be concerned — should be just a part of biology .
It ’s concerned with the nature , the growth , the development , maybe ultimately the evolution , of a particular subsystem of the organism , namely the cognitive system , which should be treated like the immune system or the digestive system , the visual system , and so on .
When we study those systems , there are a number of questions we ask .
One question is of course , you know , what they are : can we characterize them ?
But that ’s almost totally missing in cognitive science .
I mean , take my own particular area of interest , language .
A ton of work in what ’s called “ cognitive science ” on what they call “ language ” , but it ’s very rare to see some effort to characterize what it is .
Well , if you ca n’t do that , it does n’t make much difference what else you do .
The second kind of question you have to ask about any organ , if you like ( some use the term loosely ) , subsystem of the body , is how it gets the way it is .
So how does it go from some initial state , which is genetically determined , to whatever state it assumes ?
And in investigating that topic , there are a number of different factors that you can take apart for analytic purposes .
And one is the specific genetic constitution that ’s related specifically to this system .
It does n’t mean that every piece of it is used only for this system , but just whatever combination of genetically determined properties happens to determine that you have a mammalian rather than an insect visual system , for example , or a gut - brain , or whatever it may be .
That ’s one .
The second is whatever data are outside that modify the initial state to yield some attained state .
And the third is : how do laws of nature enter into the growth and development of the system ?
Which of course they do , overwhelmingly .
I mean , nobody , for example , assumes that you have a particular genetic program to determine that cells split into spheres , not cubes , let ’s say — that ’s due to , you know , minimization of energy , other laws of nature .
And the same holds throughout the course of development .
Of course , the same is true for evolution .
Evolution takes place with a specific physical , chemical channel of options and possibilities , and physical laws enter all the time into determining what goes on .
And the third question is that — it ’s kind of like a “ why ” question : why is the system this way and not some other way ?
Well , there again you go back into — at this point you really are facing , first of all , just historical accidents like , you know , an asteroid hit the Earth .
But more significantly , how do the physical and chemical properties of the universe enter into determining that certain evolutionary changes take place under particular circumstances ?
Well , that ’s the array of questions that ought to be asked .
It is very hard to find any focus on these questions , at least in the areas of cognitive science that I ’m particularly interested in , like language , for example .
What you have is extreme efforts , which are sometimes extremely strange , to try to show that trivial problems for which we basically know the answers , and have for 60 years , can be somehow dealt with by massive data analysis .
And so I could give examples , but — and , in fact , I ’ve written about examples .
But I think it ’s kind of off track .
I ’d like to see cognitive science focus on the topics that it ought to be addressing .
Now , this is a very broad brush , so a lot of it does , and there ’s very good work in cognitive science , but it ’s in my opinion much too restricted , and a lot of time and effort is spent — in my view largely wasted — on the peripheral issues which just do n’t make any sense which [ when ] you look at them , and efforts which just collapse , and constantly .
In fact , many of them are a kind of a residue of the radical behaviorism that the field sought to overcome as it developed .
I could give examples , but it ’s — a very general , broad - brush feeling — unfair to a lot of very good work .
But we ’re trying to pick out tendencies which I think are off track and missing things .
Q : What are some of your criticisms of today ’s anarchist movement ?
How to be as effective as possible is something many anarchists overlook , and you ’re perhaps the most prolific voice on this topic , so your thoughts would be very influential .
NC : Well , do n’t agree with the last comment , but my criticisms of today ’s anarchist movement are a little bit like the critique of cognitive science .
What is today ’s anarchist movement ?
I mean , there ’s quite a lot of people , in fact , you know , an impressive number of people , who think of themselves as being committed in some fashion to what they call “ anarchism ” .
But is there an anarchist movement ?
I mean , can one think of — you know , is there something like , say , during the day — .
Twenty years ago I happened to be in Madrid .
That happened to be May Day .
And there were huge demonstration — May Day demonstration , hundreds of thousands of people from the CMT , the old anarchist labor organization .
Well , you can have all kinds of criticisms of the anarchist movements in Spain and so on , but at least there was something to point to , there was something there , there was something to criticize or to support or to try to change or whatever .
But today ’s anarchism in the United States , as far as I can see , is extremely scattered , highly sectarian , so each particular group is spending a great deal of his time attacking some other tendency — sometimes doing useful , important things , but it ’s extremely hard to — .
I think what is — this is not just true of people who think of themselves as anarchists , but of the entire activist left .
Count noses .
There ’s plenty of people , I mean , more than there were at any time in the past that I can think of , except for maybe , you know , tiny , [ “ pyoosh ” ] , very brief moment late ’ 60s , or CIO organizing in the ‘ 30s , and things like that .
But there are people interested in all sorts of things .
You know , you walk down the main corridor at this university , you see , you know , desks of students , very active , very engaged , lots of great issues , but highly fragmented .
There ’s very little coordination .
There ’s a tremendous amount of sectarianism and intolerance , mutual intolerance , insistence on , you know , my particular choice as to what priorities ought to be , and so on .
So I think the main criticism of the anarchist movement is that it just ought to get its act together and accept divisions and controversies .
You know , we do n’t have the answers to — we have , maybe , guidelines as to what kind of a society we ’d like , not specific answers ; nobody knows that much .
And there ’s certainly plenty of range — of room for quite healthy and constructive disagreement on choice of tactics and priorities and options , but I just see too little of that being handled in a comradely , civilized fashion , with a sense of solidarity and common purpose .
As to how to be as effective as possible , yeah , that ’s exactly the point : what should we address ?
You do n’t have to give a list of severe problems that the world faces .
Some of them are extremely severe .
So , for example , there are really questions of species survival , literally , at least two , maybe more .
One of them is the existence of nuclear weapons .
Somebody watching from Mars would think it ’s a miracle that we ’ve survived for the last 60 years , and it ’s extremely dangerous right now , so I ca n’t see how that can fail to be a priority .
And the other is a looming environmental crisis .
And that is something that anarchists in particular should be very dedicated to addressing , because it involves — on the one hand , it does involve questions of technology , like , you know , can you get solar power to work and so on .
And the antiscience tendency in anarchism , which does exist , is completely self - defeating on this score .
I mean , it is going to take , it is going to require sophisticated technology and scientific discoveries to create the possibility for human society to survive — I mean , unless we decide , well , it just should n’t survive , we should get down to , you know , 100,000 hunter - gatherers or something .
Okay , except for that , if you ’re serious about , you know , the billions of people in the world who — and their children and grandchildren , it ’s going to require scientific and technological advances .
But it ’s also going to require radical social change .
I mean , there ’s been a — particularly in the United States , but it ’s true elsewhere , too , there have been , you know , massive state - corporate social engineering projects — very self - conscious ; they do n’t hide what they are doing — since the Second World War to try to construct a social system that is based critically on wasteful exploitation of fossil fuels .
You know , that ’s what it means to suburbanize , to build highways and destroy railroads , and so on through the whole gamut of planning that ’s been undertaken .
Well , you know , that means very substantial social changes in order , and anarchists ought to be thinking about it .
You know , thinking about it does n’t just mean I ’d like to have a free and just society ; you know , that ’s not thinking about it .
We have to make a distinction if we want to be effective .
That ’s the question : if we want to be effective , we have to make a distinction between what you might call proposals and advocacy .
I mean , you can propose that everybody ought to live in peace , love each other , we should n’t have any hierarchy , everyone should cooperate , and so on .
Okay ?
It ’s a nice proposal , okay for an academic seminar somewhere .
Advocacy requires more than just proposal .
It means setting up your goals ( proposal ) , but also sketching out a path from here to there ( that ’s advocacy ) .
And the path from here to there almost invariably requires small steps .
It requires recognition of social and economic reality as it exists , and ideas about how to build the institutions of the future within the existing society , to quote Bakunin , but also to modify the existing society .
That means steps have to be taken that accommodate reality , that do n’t deny it ’s existence ( “ Since I do n’t like it , I ’m not going to accommodate it ” ) .
These are the only ways to be effective .
You know , you can see that if you look at , you know , the serious , substantial anarchist journals .
Like , take , say , Freedom in England , which maybe is the oldest or one of the oldest anarchist journals , that ’s been around , you know , forever .
If you read its pages , most of it is concerned with mild reformist tactics .
And that ’s not a criticism .
It should be .
It should be concerned with workers rights , with specific environmental issues , with problems of poverty and suffering , with imperialism , and so on .
Yeah , that ’s what it should be concerned with if you want to advocate long - term , significant social change towards a more free and just society , and I ca n’t think of any other way to be effective .
Otherwise , the insistence on purity of proposal simply isolates you from effectiveness in activism , and even from reaching , from even approaching your own goals ; and it does lead to the kind of sectarianism and narrowness and lack of solidarity and common purpose that I think has always been a kind of pathology of marginal forces , the left in particular .
But it is particularly dangerous here .
Q : As far as we favor a stateless society in the long run , it would be a mistake to work for the elimination —
I ’ve said that it would be a mistake to work for the elimination of the state in the short run , and we should be trying to strengthen the state , ’ cause it ’s needed on the check of power of large corporations .
Yet the tendency of a lot of anarchist research — my own , too — is to show that the power of large corporations derives from state privilege , and governments tend to get captured by concentrated private interests .
That would seem to imply that the likely beneficiaries of a more powerful state is going to be the same corporate elite we ’re trying to oppose .
So if business both derives from the state and is so good at capturing the state , why is n’t abolishing the state a better strategy for defeating business power than enhancing the state ’s power would be ?
NC : Well , there ’s a very simple answer to that : it ’s not a strategy , and since it ’s not a strategy at all , there ca n’t be a better strategy .
The strategy of “ eliminating the state ” is back on the level of “ let ’s have peace and justice ” .
How do you proceed to eliminate the state ?
Okay ?
Can you think of a way of doing it ?
I mean , if there were a way of doing it in the existing world , everything would collapse and be destroyed .
You just ca n’t do it .
I mean , there is nothing to replace it .
If there was a rich , powerful network of , you know , cooperatives , community organizations , worker - controlled industry , you know , extending over the whole country , and the whole world , in fact , yeah , then you can talk about eliminating states .
But to talk about eliminating the state in the world as it exists is simply to keep yourself in some remote academic seminar or small group , you know , saying , “ Gee , this would be nice . ”
It ’s not a strategy , so there ca n’t be a better strategy .
We are faced with realities .
What is described here , and in fact it ’s true ( I ’ve written plenty about it , too ) , is that we have a number of systems of power , closely interlinked .
One of them ’s corporate power , business power .
That ’s by far the most dangerous of all .
That means , effectively , unaccountable private tyrannies .
A second , pretty closely linked to them , is state power .
And the comment is correct ( as the commentator says , I ’ve written about it , too , a lot ) that state power tends to be overwhelmingly influenced by concentrated private power .
Okay , those are real problems .
Now we face strategies .
So , for example , say — take , say , health care , okay ?
Right on the front pages .
What ’s the strategy for dealing with the fact that tens of millions of people ca n’t get — the best health care they can get is to be dragged to an emergency room when it ’s too late to do anything ?
I mean , that ’s a real problem , and that ’s a huge part of the population .
Second problem is that in a privatized , unregulated health - care system like the United States ’ —
I should n’t say “ like , ” because it ’s the only one .
In a privatized , unregulated health - care system where the drug companies are so powerful that the government is n’t even allowed to negotiate drug prices , in that kind of system , first of all , health care is strictly rationed by wealth , very strictly , and secondly , it is designed in such a way that the federal budget is going to be destroyed .
You just take a look at the tendency lines .
There wo n’t be anything left for schools , for Social Security , for worker safety , anything .
What ’ll be left is for the military .
That ’s untouchable .
It keeps going up — another problem we ’ve got to look at .
Obama has the biggest military budget since the Second World War .
But as long as that is over there , untouchable , another elephant in the closet , the radically inefficient privatized , unregulated health - care system , is extremely harmful for people , except for the wealthy — you know , they do fine — and is also going to destroy everyone else .
So what we do about it ?
Well , it ’s not a strategy to say , okay , let ’s abolish the state .
That does n’t do anything about it , and in fact it ’s just a gift to the corporate state power sector ’ cause it offers nothing .
A short - term answer is to do what the large majority of the population has wanted for decades , namely , to develop a sensible national health - care system of the kind that every other industrial country has , one variety or another .
Well , it happens to be a large majority opinion , so you do n’t have to break down many walls to organize people about it .
It has been for decades .
It ’s strongly opposed by the corporate - state nexus , but that ’s not unbreakable ; you know , bigger victories have been won .
We could go into details , you know , like what you do about the fact that the Democrats have sold out , for obvious reasons , on even minor palliatives like a public option and so on .
What do you do about the fact , a very concrete fact — .
There was just an election in Massachusetts which surprised everyone totally — almost completely misrepresented , but I wo n’t go into that .
But one of the striking things about the election was that the union members , Obama ’s natural constituency , most of them did n’t bother voting ’ cause there was tremendous apathy in the poor , working - class areas .
( The election was won by the wealthy suburbs . )
But of those who voted , most of them voted for Scott Brown , the Republican , against the Democrats — shooting themselves in the foot , incidentally , ’ cause one of the first things that happened is to knock off one possibly pro-union member from the National Labor Relations Board .
But they had reasons , and the reasons are very clear — just read the labor press .
The reasons are that Obama made it very explicit that he was willing to compromise or give up on everything except one thing : taxing union members for their health - care plans .
So , sure , people are enraged about that .
I mean , why should n’t they be ?
It ’s not an anarchist position ; it ’s just a simple , elementary , human position .
Well , okay , if you ’re interested in the long - term project of the questioner , namely dissolving state and corporate power , you should be paying attention to that and you should be organizing workers on that .
You should n’t leave it to Rush Limbaugh to organize people with real legitimate grievances — you know , that ’s the way to fascism .
You should be out there organizing them themselves , on their concerns .
You know , their concerns can be related to , and easily related to , much longer - term anarchist - style projects , but that ’s where anarchists should be working .
And the same is true in every other part of the society .
I mean , look , some of the things that are going on now are kind of surreal , but would offer real opportunities for anarchist organizing .
So let me take another one .
The tendency in the economy for the last 30 years by state - corporate planning — and these things do n’t happen from out of the blue — has been towards financializing the economy .
And corollary to that is undermining domestic production .
Okay ?
The two go together .
So , for example , the share of financial institutions in GDP , you know , gross domestic product , was maybe 3 percent back in 1970 ; now it ’s approaching a third .
And , concomitantly , productive industry is being dismantled , which is fine for the owners , you know , great with them if they can produce in , you know , Mexico or in China or something , but it ’s terrible for communities and workers .
At the same time , it ’s finally being recognized — even by the corporate elite , which has been fighting bitterly against it for years — that there ’s a real environmental crisis coming , and they ’re going to lose what they own .
So they want to do something about it .
And so what they ’re now kind of timidly saying is , well , we should n’t — not be the only country in the industrial world that does n’t have high - speed rail ; we should have high - speed rail — a minimal but significant move towards dealing with a severe potential crisis .
Well , right at this moment the government and the corporations are dismantling productive industry , say in Michigan and Indiana , by closing GM plants and so on and sending the production abroad , or — you know , they ’re doing that ; that ’s one thing they ’re doing .
The other thing that ’s happening is that Obama ’s transportation secretary is in Europe , in Spain , using federal stimulus money , namely taxpayer money , to try to get contracts for Spanish firms to provide high - speed rail that the United States needs .
Can you think of a better — I mean , it ’s hard to think of a more dramatic criticism of the state - corporate socioeconomic system .
Here are communities and workforces being destroyed , while we , while their tax money goes to purchase in Spain what they could be producing themselves .
Now , if you ca n’t organize about that , you ’re really in trouble : you ’re not a movement at all .
Of course , should the — take , say , the workers in Gary , Indiana , or Flint , Michigan , and so on .
Do they have to just sit and watch this happen ?
No .
They can take over the workplaces , the factories .
They can run them themselves .
They can convert them .
It ’s been done before , with much greater conversion , during the Second World War , to wartime production .
They do n’t need state support for that , ’ cause that ’s the only institution that exists and the only one that people can influence .
You ca n’t influence a private tyranny .
You can influence the government .
It ’s often been done .
It would take some support , but nowhere near as much as bailing out Goldman Sachs and so on .
It would take some , it would take a lot of popular support , but it can be done .
I mean , it can even be done within the framework of conservative economic theory , which is pretty straight about this .
I mean , you read textbooks on corporations that say , well , you know , it ’s not graven in stone that they should work only for the benefit of shareholders , which means a tiny percentage of wealthy shareholders ; they can work in the interests of stakeholders , meaning workforce and community .
And they ’re not going to decide to do that , but the workforce and the community can decide it for them .
Those are perfectly feasible efforts .
In fact , it ’s been done ; you know , there are cases where it ’s been done .
There ’s cases where it ’s even been tried on a very large scale .
Like , U.S. Steel came close to succeeding , and could with more corporate support .
Well , you know , these are — I could go on with this , but these are real organizing strategies which combine short - term efforts , which confront real problems that people face in their everyday lives , with long - term objectives like creating part of the basis for a society based on free association and solidarity and popular control and so on , and it ’s sitting right there in front of our eyes .
Those , in my view , are the things we should be looking at , not abstract questions like should we try to destroy the state , for which we have no strategy .
My feeling is that ’s the kind of direction in which thinking ought to move .
It does n’t mean giving up your long - term goals .
In fact , that ’s the way to realize them .
And if there ’s another way to realize them , I ’ve never heard of it .
…
I guess the question that comes to mind that just grows out of these comments is there ’s a very large number of people who are committed sincerely and rightly to the kind of long - term objectives that anarchists have always tried to uphold .
And the question is : why ca n’t we get together and decide on — and instead of , you know , condemning one another for not doing things exactly the way we do , why ca n’t we try to formulate concrete proposals which combine two properties ?
One , dealing with the real problems that people face in their immediate , daily lives — if you ’re going to get anywhere , you ’re going to have to deal with those , and it ’s not just for tactical reasons , it ’s also out of simple humanity .
So on the one hand those , while maintaining as your guidelines the conception of the kind of just and free society that you would like to bring into being through these steps .
And sometimes the two are very close together , as in the case that I mentioned , like takeover of a productive enterprise by a workforce and communities , which is not — you know , it ’s a feasible objective , and one that has great deal of appeal , or would have if it were put forward , as do others , and combines both long - term vision and the short - term dealing with real , existing grievances and problems .
And there are quite a few things like that .
So the question is : why not focus on that rather than on abstract questions , such as what ’s the best strategy for destroying state ?
Answer : well , no best strategy , ’ cause nobody ’s proposed any .

Systems for ranking the world 's higher - education and research institutions are about to become more sophisticated , says Declan Butler .
Improved university rankings may help students , researchers and policy - makers to make better choices .
S. JARRATT / CORBIS
Every autumn , politicians , university administrators , funding offices and countless students wait impatiently for the World University Rankings produced by Britain 's Times Higher Education ( THE ) magazine .
A position in the upper echelons of the THE ranking can influence policy - makers ' higher - education investments , determine which institutions attract the best researchers or students , and prompt universities to try to boost their ratings .
But academics and universities have long criticized what they describe as the outsized influence of the THE and other university rankings , saying that their methodology and data are problematic ( see Nature 447 , 514–515 ; 2007 ) .
Many universities see wild swings in their rankings from year to year , for example , which cannot reflect real changes in quality ; and many French universities ' ratings suffer because their researchers ' publications often list affiliations with national research agencies as well as the university itself , diluting the benefit for the university .
Now , universities and other stakeholders are developing their own rankings to tackle these shortcomings .
" Rankings have outgrown the expectations of those who started them , " says Kazimierz Bilanow , managing director of the IREG Observatory on Academic Rankings and Excellence , a Warsaw - based ranking quality - assurance body created in October 2009 .
" What were often exercises intended to boost newspaper circulation have come to have enormous influence on policy - making and funding of institutions and governments . "
Several approaches to university rankings now being developed are switching the emphasis away from crude league tables and towards more nuanced assessments that could provide better guidance for policy - makers , funding bodies , researchers and students alike .
They promise to rank universities on a much wider range of criteria , and assess more intangible qualities , such as educational excellence .
And the THE ranking list is trying to remake itself in the face of the criticism .
One complaint is that the THE 's rankings rely heavily on reputational surveys , which involve polling academics about which universities they think are the best in a given field .
Some argue that these assessments often use too few academics , who may not be well informed about all the universities they are being asked to judge , and that there is a bias towards English - speaking countries .
In November 2009 , the THE announced that the data for its rankings would no longer be supplied by QS , a London - based higher - education media company .
" We are very much aware that national policy and multimillion - pound decisions are influenced by these rankings , " said THE editor Ann Mroz at the time .
" We are also acutely aware of the criticisms made of the methodology .
Therefore , we feel we have a duty to improve how we compile them . "
League - table turnabout
The THE will in future draw its ranking data from the Global Institutional Profiles Project , which was launched by data provider Thomson Reuters in January .
The project aims to create a comprehensive database on thousands of the world 's universities , including details of research funding , numbers of researchers and PhDs awarded , and measures of educational performance .
The company will also use its internal citation and publication data to generate multiple indicators of institutions ' research performance , and will build in auditing procedures to guard against misinformation provided by universities .
Thomson Reuters plans to continue reputational surveys , but aims to have at least 25,000 reviewers , compared with the 4,000 used by QS for the THE 2009 rankings .
It has partnered with UK pollster Ipsos MORI to try to ensure the survey is representative .
" We are not doing this randomly , but putting a lot of thought behind it , " says Simon Pratt , project manager for institutional research at Thomson Reuters .
" We want a more balanced view across all subject areas . "
The THE will continue to rank all universities in the form of a league table , which critics say offers a false precision that exaggerates differences between institutions .
But the new rankings will be more nuanced and detailed , according to Pratt , including data that enable institutions to compare themselves on various indicators with peers having similar institutional profiles .
Comparing like with like is the cornerstone of a European Commission effort to create a global database of universities — the Multi- dimensional Global ranking of Universities ( U - Multirank ) .
A pilot project involving 150 universities will be launched in the coming months by a group of German , Dutch , Belgian and French research centres that specialize in research and education metrics , known as the Consortium for Higher Education and Research Performance Assessment .
U - Multirank hopes to focus its comparisons on institutions that have similar activities and missions .
Existing league tables lump together all types of universities , but comparing a large multidisciplinary university with a regional university focused on teaching , for example , makes little sense , says Frans van Vught , one of U - Multirank 's project leaders and former president and rector of the University of Twente in Enschede , the Netherlands .
To identify universities with similar profiles , the project will draw on a sister European Union project , U - Map , in which van Vught is also involved .
U - Map is building a classification of universities based on their level of research activity , the types of degrees and student programmes offered , as well as the extent of other important roles such as their regional and industrial engagement and international orientation .
U - Multirank will develop indicators of performance on each of these aspects .
After completion of the pilots , the two projects will seek philanthropic funding to become operational services , says van Vught .
U - Multirank also hopes to overcome one of the major criticisms of many existing ranking systems : that they focus excessively on research output , neglecting the many other crucial roles that universities have , not least teaching .
Indeed , the Academic Ranking of World Universities , compiled by Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China and generally known as the Shanghai index , focuses exclusively on research output and citation impact , including variables such as numbers of Nobel prizewinners and publications in Nature and Science ( see ' Top marks ' ) .
Rankings that use citation counts do not usually take into account the widely different citation rates among disciplines .
This biases rankings in favour of biomedical research institutions , penalizing those that publish mainly in the social sciences or in other fields with lower citation rates .
By contrast , both the Thomson Reuters and U - Multirank initiatives will use a variety of normalized bibliometric indicators that take this , and other pitfalls , into account .
In place of league tables , U - Multirank will give an overall grade of institutional performance on each of the various indicators it considers , allowing students , scientists and policy - makers to access and combine the indicators most relevant to them , so making their own à la carte rankings .
" They will be able to look at the data through their own spectacles , " says van Vught .
But as everyone in the field acknowledges , educational aspects of universities are particularly difficult to compare .
Research is an international activity , and reasonable indicators exist for comparing institutions .
Education , by contrast , is largely organized nationally and reflects different cultures and traditions .
" It 's a much tougher problem , " says Pratt .
University dropout rates in France , for example , cannot be compared directly with those in other countries because all students who pass the baccalauréat automatically acquire a place at a French university .
Selection takes place at the end of the first undergraduate year , and not immediately after leaving high school , pushing up the dropout rate .
Similarly , the length and content of degrees often vary greatly between countries .
Measuring ideas
That 's a gap in assessment that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) is trying to fill .
Last month , it launched a US $ 12.5 - million pilot project , the Assessment of Higher Education Learning Outcomes ( AHELO ) , to develop new metrics for assessing teaching and learning outcomes .
The project , which does not intend to produce rankings , will try to measure complex aspects of university life — such as the ability of students to think critically and come up with original ideas — across different cultures and languages .
Although few details are yet available , it says it intends to launch a pilot involving 200 students in a dozen or so universities in six countries , including the United States and Japan .
" We will be watching the development of the AHELO exercise very closely , " says Ben Sowter , QS 's head of research .
QS intends to continue developing its university ranking despite losing its link to the THE .
" We will continue improving the methodology and response levels to the surveys , " says Sowter , adding that he welcomes the new competition .
Other experts say that having more rankings will be beneficial , as it will reduce the undue influence of any one ranking .

And now it is the rankings ' turn to be assessed .
The European University Association , which represents more than 800 universities , plans to publish annual reviews of all international rankings , assessing their methodologies and scrutinizing why institutions rise or fall in the rankings .
The effort will be loosely modelled on an existing overview of ranking systems produced by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research and the Rectors ' Conference of the Swiss Universities .
The reviews should help users to decide on which ranking data can best answer key questions about universities ' performance .
" Any ranking exercise , however sophisticated , is being irresponsible if it projects itself as the right answer to a question , whereas the only right answer is in the hands of the person asking it , " says Sowter .
The Washington State Senate voted 34 - 13 to expand the number of medical professionals that can prescribe medical marijuana ( see the link for the bill ) .
Since the House already approved the bill in their chamber , the only thing left is for Governor Chris Gregoire to sign it , which she has indicated she will .
The bill adds physician assistants , naturopaths , advanced registered nurse practitioners and others among the list of qualified people that can approve marijuana for medicinal purposes .
This makes Washington the only state in the nation to allow people other than just physicians to do so .
Washington State allows 15 plants per card ( any size ) , and possession of up to 24 dried ounces .
What is amazing to me is that the state legislature brought the change , not an initiative by the voters .
They claimed it was to help people in rural areas where it is harder to get approved for the program .
FINALLY , COMMON SENSE FROM THE GOVERNMENT !!
I ca n’t believe it .
This will dramatically expand access to patients that want to be in the program .
I sure hope other states will follow suit , as there are far more assistants , naturopaths , etc , than there are doctors out there , and I bet they are more open minded about signing forms for medical marijuana .
The Washington State legislation is Senate Bill 5798 .

The likes of Michael Schumacher , Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton are always going to command the most attention in F1 .
But we should n’t overlook the rookie field of 2010 , which is one of the most promising we ’ve seen in years .
And it includes the return of a name which is even more famous than those three .
Nico H?�??lkenberg
2009 form : GP2 champion , 100 points , five wins
If there is such a thing as a textbook route into F1 , Nico H?�?? lkenberg demonstrated it .
His 2006 - 07 A1 Grand Prix campaign for Team Germany was a tour de force – he was never seriously rivalled on his way to the championship .
He went on to mimic Lewis Hamilton ’s feat of winning the F3 Euroseries and GP2 championships in successive seasons with the crack ART squad .
Williams have had him under their wing for some time .
He shook down the FW31 last year and got some extra running at the end of the season in the young drivers ’ training days .
He ’s got the most experienced F1 driver ever alongside him to learn from and perhaps , eventually , beat .
Speaking to him during F1 testing he felt Rubens Barrichello ’s F1 experience would come into play for him once the season get started and the pair are out on - track together .
There ’s not much more you could ask from his preparation for F1 .
The question now is whether H ?�?? lkenberg can translate his obvious potential into F1 results .
Vitaly Petrov
2009 form : second in GP2 , 75 points , two wins
The deal which brought Vitaly Petrov to Renault was something of a surprise in spite of a solid 2009 campaign which saw Petrov finish runner - up to H ?�?? lkenberg in GP2 .
Being the first driver from a country which has never had an F1 driver before his CV is rather different from the usual karts / F3 / GP2 fare – few if any other F1 drivers have raced in championships for Ladas .
Petrov has been steady if unspectacular and he ’s up against a very highly - rated team mate in Robert Kubica in a team that ’s been through some turbulent times .
It could be a tricky debut season for the first Russian in F1 .
Lucas di Grassi
2009 form : third in GP2 , 63 points , one win
Arguably the GP2 title should have gone to Lucas di Grassi in 2007 .
He inherited the ART car which Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg had won the title with in the previous two seasons , yet fell short .
He was beaten to the crown by Timo Glock , his team mate at Virgin this year , despite the German driver suffering reliability problems .
Di Grassi rescued his reputation in 2008 when he managed to finish third in the championship despite not contesting the first six races .
But in 2009 he once again had the previous champions ’ car and , once again , no title .
I spoke to him at Jerez a couple of times last month and his excitement at getting his F1 break was clearly tempered by concern over how little running the team were able to get done in between car problems and the rain .
Bruno Senna
2009 form : 16th in Le Mans Series , 12 points
If H ?�?? lkenberg got his F1 graduation spot-on , Bruno Senna has been dogged by problems and false starts .
His family halted his first attempt at a motor racing career after the death of his uncle Ayrton .
He eventually persuaded them to let him back on the track and quickly caught up to his rivals .
His last British F3 season in 2006 saw him place third overall , his season disrupted by an enormous crash at Snetteron where he came frighteningly close to hitting the bridge on the Revett straight .
He moved up to GP2 but lost out to Giorgio Pantano in the 2008 title battle .
Honda sized him up for a 2009 drive alongside Jenson Button before they pulled out , leaving him in limbo last year .
Senna appeared in four sports car races , including the Le Mans 24 Hours , but other than those appearances , and with no testing in the HRT , he ’s not been in the cockpit much over the last 12 months .
For the time being , living up to his uncle ’s reputation is out of the question .
Karun Chandhok
2009 form : 18th in GP2 , ten points
Karun Chandhok had good results in Asian national championships against weaker opposition but has only won a few races since moving into higher racing formulae .
The popular Indian driver , only the second native of his country to get into F1 , drove alongside Senna at iSport in 2008 and was out - scored by his team mate .
That may well be the case at HRT this year but the performance of the untried car is a greater concern in the immediate future .
The almost - rookies
Two drivers who were drafted in to F1 teams last year will start their first full seasons in 2010 .
When Jaime Alguersuari became the youngest ever F1 driver at last year ’s Hungarian Grand Prix there were complaints from some quarters that his inexperience would make him a danger on the track .
That never proved to be the case , although he did suffer a large crash at Suzuka .
With more experience and more time in the car we should get a better impression of what he can do this year .
The two starts Kamui Kobayashi made for Toyota last year propelled him into the headlines as he duelled with Button and gave no quarter .
At times he looked a bit too uncomprising and there were complaints from his rivals .
But a mature drive at Yas Island including a careful defence from Kimi R?�? �ikk ?�? �nen on the opening lap brought him an excellent sixth place .
His pass on Button in that race was voted overtaking move of the year on this site .
He impressed Peter Sauber enough to get a drive at his team in 2010 .
Though we had grown used to seeing Japanese F1 drivers always with Japanese - engined teams , that is not the case with Kobayashi this year , which is a significant indicator of his talent .

Women who drink wine 'less likely to gain weight '
Red wine drinkers gained least weight Women can enjoy a tipple and stay slim , according to a study that shows moderate drinkers gain less weight than teetotallers .
Women who drank red wine gained the least , but the results held for other wines , beers and spirits .
Although alcohol contains calories , the US researchers believe the women may have substituted it for other food .
Their work in the Archives of Internal Medicine followed over 19,000 women over 13 years .
The women recruited into the study were aged 39 or over and of normal weight at the time they joined .
It would be a mistake to think that drinking alcohol helps you lose weight
Catherine Collins , British Dietetic Association
Over the next 13 years , on average , they gained weight progressively .
Those who drank no alcohol gained the most weight , and there was an inverse relationship between weight gain and alcohol consumption .
Even after accounting for lifestyle , dietary factors and things like smoking and exercise , the study found those who drank the least gained the most weight .
Moderate drinking was classed as drinking up to about two 150 ml glasses of wine a day .
Although the study did not include men , the authors believe the findings may not apply to men .
The women in the study who drank appeared to substitute alcohol for other food , meaning their overall calorie intake did not go up that much .
They say men who drink might not do this .
Also the way men and women break down alcohol in their liver may differ , which help might explain why women do not pile on the pounds .
But British researchers cautioned that people should be wary of concluding they can shed pounds by drinking more .
Catherine Collins , dietician and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association , said : " It would be a mistake to think that drinking alcohol helps you lose weight . "
She rejected the notion that the calories in alcohol do n't contribute to weight gain .
" We know that alcohol calories do count .
For binge drinkers , for example , alcohol can have a major impact on weight . "
She pointed out that the study was based on women who were normal weight when they were recruited .
" These are quite an unusual group , who were likely to be mindful of keeping their body healthy , " she said .
" Most women would have gained a few extra pounds by the age of 39 .
" To be of normal weight by that age is quite a feat in itself .
" So findings about weight gain among this group may not be translate to others . "
She said another limitation of the research was that it did not report how much snack food the participants ate .
" It may be that those who had wine as their treat ate less chocolate and snacks , " she said .

Driving the Day
TRUMP , BIDEN AND A HOT MESS OF A HEALTH CARE DEBATE —
For the first 20 minutes of Tuesday ’s presidential debate , the nominees argued , obfuscated and hurled accusations over a range of health issues , including but not limited to : coronavirus , Obamacare , abortion , drug prices , vaccines , trust in science , stay - at - home orders , private health insurance , the public option , and the Trump administration ’s ongoing lack of a health care plan .
As for what the voting public got out of all that ?
Not a whole lot .
Here ’s what we do know :
— Trump offered no new defense of his pandemic response .
He instead spent much of the debate interrupting and talking over Biden , turning much of the night into an unintelligible back - and - forth .
When Trump did address the pandemic , he fell back on old talking points like playing up the January decision restricting travel from China , repeated assertions that he ’d done a “ great job ” managing the public health threat and urged states to reopen .
— Trump contradicted his top health officials — and overpromised on a vaccine .
The president publicly disagreed again with the views of his CDC director and top vaccine science adviser that a viable vaccine could take until the end of the year , claiming without evidence that it would happen “ a lot sooner . ”
— Biden tried to block out the noise , and keep the focus on Covid - 19 .
The Democratic nominee on several occasions refused to engage with Trump , making his case directly to the camera that Trump ’s pandemic response has failed .
“ The president has no plan , ” he said at one point , and throughout the debate sought to pivot the discussion back to the pandemic .
— Only one side sees the SCOTUS fight as synonymous with health care .
Echoing Democrats ’ broader strategy , Biden immediately tried to tie the debate over the Supreme Court to the fate of Obamacare .
But his points landed only briefly before they were buried by Trump ’s interruptions and attacks .
The president , meanwhile , framed the high court debate more simply :
He won the 2016 election , and therefore he should get his nominee .
— Do n’t expect any policy nuance on drug pricing and health coverage .
Trump weaved a series of falsehoods and half - truths when it came to drug prices and Obamacare , including one notable whopper :
That insulin is so cheap it ’s “ like water ” ( insulin often retails at hundreds of dollars per vial ) .
And most of that came in service of trying to falsely link Biden to left - wing health plans — rather than defending his own record or offering a second - term vision .
Biden , meanwhile , focused on hammering home the various progressive ideas that he would not support as president , like eliminating private health insurance .
INSIDE THE ADMINISTRATION's SUDDENLY SHAKY AD BLITZ — HHS officials made a list of more than 30 celebrities including Justin Timberlake , Taylor Swift and Billy Joel to appear in their ad campaign to " inspire hope " about coronavirus , but they ended up with only Dennis Quaid , CeCe Winans and Hasidic singer Shulem Lemmer , POLITICO 's Dan Diamond scooped .
— The $ 300 million - plus campaign had been conceived by Michael Caputo , the HHS spokesperson who 's now on medical leave .
One stated goal was to help raise Americans ' morale amid the outbreak , and HHS has maintained that the public service announcement effort is focused on public health , not politics .
Democrats have alleged that the rushed campaign is an effort to boost Trump 's prospects before the election .
But the effort was already flagging before POLITICO last week reported on Caputo 's business ties to the subcontractor selected to produce the PSAs .
Tasked to come up with 20 public service announcements before the election , the production team had only succeeded in booking three — Quaid , Winans and Lemmer — and Quaid this week quit the campaign , saying that his participation was not political and he was n't paid for it .
— Inside the health department , officials say they have concerns about how the campaign has been executed and funded , with Caputo 's team tightly steering the campaign 's development after abruptly taking $ 300 million from the CDC .
" There are ways to inform the American people about the risks of coronavirus , " said one HHS official .
" This was n't the way to do it . "
On the Hill
PELOSI , MNUCHIN SEEK LAST - DITCH COVID DEAL —
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will speak with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin one last time today in hopes of striking a longshot deal on more coronavirus aid , POLITICO ’s Heather Caygle , Melanie Zanona and Sarah Ferris report .
— Democrats are anticipating a GOP offer by noon .
That Republican proposal is expected to contain roughly $ 1.5 trillion in aid — more than the White House initially wanted to spend , but still far less than Democrats ’ $ 2.2 trillion minimum .
That persistent gap on a top - line number has prevented the two sides from reaching an agreement for more than a month .
— A fallback option could move fast .
If the talks fall apart again , Democrats are likely to push ahead with passing their own $ 2.2 trillion aid bill .
Under that scenario , a vote could happen as soon as this week .
SCHUMER TRIES TO CENTER SCOTUS FIGHT ON OBAMACARE — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday set up a vote blocking the Justice Department from supporting litigation to overturn the Affordable Care Act , POLITICO ’s Marianne LeVine and Susannah Luthi report .
The unusual procedural move escalates Democrats ’ campaign to make Judge Amy Coney Barrett ’s Supreme Court confirmation a referendum on the future of Obamacare .
The party has warned that she could provide the deciding vote in favor of a GOP - led lawsuit to eliminate the ACA that the high court is scheduled to hear in November .
— It also forces GOP senators on the record .
The Senate will likely take a roll call vote on Thursday , forcing several vulnerable Republican lawmakers to weigh in on whether the Trump administration should support the anti-Obamacare lawsuit .
— Meanwhile : Barrett met with a range of Republicans on Tuesday .
She trekked to the Hill for several hours of meetings with GOP senators , kicking off Republicans ’ sprint to confirm her before Election Day .
And in written responses to a Senate Judiciary questionnaire obtained by POLITICO ’s Andrew Desiderio and Mariane LeVine , Barrett did not commit to recusing herself from possible cases related to the outcome of the 2020 election .
Opioids
HOW THE US SPENT $ 7.6 BILLION IN OPIOID CRISIS FUNDING — Roughly three - quarters of the $ 7.6 billion in federal aid set aside to combat the opioid crisis went to treatment , recovery and prevention efforts in fiscal 2019 , according to a new Bipartisan Policy Center report out today .
The rest went toward research , interdiction , law enforcement and other criminal justice initiatives .
— But BPC researchers raised a series of concerns about that overall spending , including difficulties tracking whether the money is effectively meeting the needs of people at the highest risk of overdose .
The report also found that incarcerated individuals in many places still lack access to medication assisted treatment — and that states have had difficulty offering community - based care and wraparound services when those people re-enter society .
— What could help :
The BPC researchers recommended that Congress boost funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ’s substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant .
They also advocated removing federal restrictions on funding for syringes as part of a broader harm reduction strategy , targeting grant funding to address treatment gaps among minority populations , and making permanent the administration ’s pandemic - prompted expansion of telehealth services .
A message from PhRMA : America ’s biopharmaceutical companies are making great progress against a common enemy – COVID - 19 .
They ’re learning from successful vaccines for other diseases , developing new treatments and collaborating like never before .
Today , there are several promising vaccine candidates in stage three clinical trials .
These trials have tens of thousands of participants , from every walk of life .
From development to robust clinical trials , and throughout manufacturing , these vaccine candidates follow the same rigorous process of other vaccines that have saved millions of lives .
America ’s biopharmaceutical companies are working day and night until they defeat COVID - 19 .
Because science is how we get back to normal .

SANAA , Yemen — Perhaps it was the spandex shorts .
When a group of about 200 young people gathered to watch two - dozen or so foreigners rollerblading their way down the road , joint pads and shiny black helmets glinting in the afternoon sun — and yes , an occasional glimpse of spandex — the looks on Yemeni faces ranged from delighted to quizzical to astonished .
Of course , given the group — students and the disabled — had been bussed into the capital for the occasion , there was much cheering and waving of Yemeni flags , too .
“ This is exactly the goal .
We want to show people things they have never seen before ! ” said Claire Leonard , the effusive president of Planet Roller — the eccentric Paris - based organization responsible for bringing the rollerbladers to Yemen recently .
The quirky band of enthusiasts , among them teenagers and sexagenarians , spent a little more than a week in Yemen , teaching local kids how to rollerblade , handing out extra pairs of skates and exploring a new culture .
Their visit continued a trend toward youth - focused activities — encouraged by the Yemeni authorities — promoting tolerance as a “ soft , ” yet vital , form of international aid .
The French Cultural Center in Sanaa — funded by the French government — has launched a small theater program for local university students , with weekly break - dancing practice sessions and regular exhibits and symposiums where locals can display artwork , listen to lectures and speak their mind .
Last fall , the German and French cultural centers in Sanaa partnered up to put on a concert featuring teenage boys performing a mixture of traditional Yemeni dance , hip - hop and rap , and some American aid groups have expressed interest in supporting a climbing and hiking club for young Yemenis to explore their own land .
“ The idea is to give [ young people ] a place to start .
Give them something that they can then take away and do on their own , ” said Cloe Vaniscotte , who heads the cultural mission at the French Cultural Center .
She estimates that although relatively small numbers of young people participate — usually between 20 and 25 kids — the “ ripple effect ” is greater .
“ They tell their friends and their families , and it spreads , ” she said .
In a place like Yemen , where anti-Western — and particularly anti-American — sentiment runs high , both international actors and some Yemeni politicians have recognized that changing young people ’s perspectives is an important part of establishing peace in Yemen ’s future .
Yemen is a chronically impoverished nation , where an estimated 40 percent of the population is unemployed , even more are illiterate , and many have been steeped in a very conservative , often intolerant , strain of Islam .
“ There is a prevailing culture of jihad ” in Yemen said Hassan Zaid , president of Yemen ’s parliamentary opposition coalition was quoted by local press as saying last month .
He said state educational curriculum , thousands of Saudi - funded Salafi religious schools , and some Yemeni media " combine to spread the belief that anyone who is unlike you can be killed .
Let ’s just say that if Osama bin Laden was watching , he would be very , very happy . ”
While hip - hop concerts and French rollerbladers are n’t going to solve the problem of extremism or youth unemployment , it ’s a step in the right direction , say the French participants .
“ The other night when we were rollerblading through the Old City , there was an exchange between the locals and us , ” said Romain Nicolas , 34 , with a day job as a computer scientist back in Paris .
“ We were not just tourists or foreigners to them — we were people having fun , doing something new .
The rollerblades completely change everyone ’s perspective . ”
Muriel Renard , who works as an audiologist in Paris , said that while she hoped Planet Roller had helped break a few stereotypes Yemenis held of Westerners , the trip was equally important in demonstrating to French people that Yemen is “ more than just Al Qaeda . ”
“ It ’s true .
All people hear about Yemen in France is that there is Al Qaeda here , there are terrorists , or that it ’s dangerous , ” said Khadija al - Salami , a Yemeni author - cum - “ French ” rollerblader , who works in the Yemeni Embassy in Paris and who accompanied the rollerbladers to the country .
That was especially true earlier after a Yemen - based Al Qaeda affiliate took responsibility for the attempted bombing of an airline landing in Detroit on Christmas Day .
Many rollerbladers who were supposed to make the trip dropped out , said to Leonard , the president .
“ But there are misconceptions on both sides of the line , ” said al - Salami .
“ Before I [ went to college ] in America , the people here told me to be careful .
They said , ‘ Do n’t wear jewelry , they will cut off your fingers to get your rings . ’
It ’s true : People need to meet each other to understand each other . ”
Planet Roller brought a team to Yemen once before , in 2006 .
Since it was founded in 1999 , the organization has brought hundreds of rollerbladers to dozens of countries , including Cuba , Tunisia , Tahiti and Senegal .
On the street beside the presidential mosque , two of the French rollerbladers helped a Yemeni woman , dressed head to toe in a black abaya , with nothing but her eyes showing , into a pair of skates .
She was wobbly at first , like a foal on new legs , but after a few halting steps began to roll , then slide , then glide off over the pavement , her eyes smiling beneath her veil .

When 30 Senate Republicans voted to protect corporate - sponsored rape , it seemed that we had finally reached the nadir of the Party of No .
But yesterday , House Republicans gave their senate cohorts a run for their scum - sucking money when they refused to support H.R. 4247 , the Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act .
The bill passed , but 153 House Republicans , so intent on saying no to any legislation introduced by a Democrat , could n't bring themselves to agree that children in school should n't be tied up , drugged , or isolated in order to discipline them .
This should serve as a reminder to anyone humming the Kumbaya , bipartisan song ... you cannot deal in any meaningful way with people who are hell - bent on saying no to anything and everything to further their political aims .
With this device , the next time you 're talking to your bank on the bus , or conversing with your mistress while at home , what you want private remains private .
Of course , you will have to wear electrodes on your face , and that might tip some people off that you 're trying to hide something .
NEW YORK , March 20 ( UPI ) --
A federal judge has refused to accept a $ 575 million settlement over cleanup at the World Trade Center site in New York .
U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said Friday the settlement is not adequate for New York City workers , mostly police officers and firefighters , who have suffered debilitating illness , The New York Times reported .
At a hearing , he said he was taking " judicial control " that would include reviewing how much lawyers for the plaintiffs will get in fees .

Most of the plaintiffs praised the judge .
They included Richard Volpe , 42 , who retired early as a New York police detective because of kidney failure .
" I 'm very proud of the compassion and bravery the judge has shown , " Volpe told the New York Daily News .
" I do n't know what the next step is .
I do n't know if the judge knows .
But it is a good step . "
Under the terms of the settlement , the city agreed to payments that would have totaled somewhere between $ 575 million and $ 675 million .
Researchers have recently determined , in a new scientific study , that watching a woman with an hourglass body type tends to have the reward response in the brain of a male as drinking alcohol or using drugs .
The same pleasure centers in the brain light up , as they would if the males were engaged in this type of risky behavior .
According to the experts behind this investigation , this discovery could help to partially explain the fascination that some men have towards visiting for example adult websites .
The body of work could also provide additional explanations for why even young boys tend to easily fall prey to this habit , LiveScience reports .
Even from ancient times , women with larger , curvier hips have been associated with fertility , and so , strictly evolutionarily speaking , it makes more sense for men to be more attracted to these females .
While modern society has sought to fit all women within a mindless and unhealthy standard of beauty , these evolutionary “ callings ” still remain , as our genetic baggage remembers what fuller shapes actually mean .
Several cross-cultural studies have already determined that men from all countries and from all races tend to find hourglass - shaped women more appealing .
In a new set of experiments , scientists had about 14 young males look at pictures of the backside of women , before and after cosmetic surgery that redistributed body fat around .
In all instances , the surgeries were meant to give the women more curvy hips .
According to the scientists , the overall amount of weight in each of the females was not reduced or enhanced , only moved around .
While they were watching these pictures , the men were subjected to brain scans .
The imaging process revealed that post - surgery women were the most attractive to them .
Regions of the brain that also activate in response to drugs and alcohol were found to light up when the participants saw post - op women .
“ It turns out women find similar optimally attractive female bodies as attention - grabbing , albeit for different reasons .
Women size up other women in an effort to determine their own relative attractiveness and to maintain mate guarding – or , in other words , keep their mate away from optimally designed females , ” explains Georgia Gwinnett College evolutionary cognitive neuroscientist Steven Platek .
Details of the new investigation appear in the February 5 online issue of the open- access scientific journal PLoS ONE , a publication of the Public Library of Science .

Triple world champion Ayrton Senna would have been 50 years old today .
The Brazilian legend electrified Formula 1 from the moment he arrived with the humble Toleman team in 1984 until his tragic death at the age of 34 in an accident during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix .
Senna would ultimately win three world championships with McLaren in 1988 , 1990 and 1991 , and developed one of the most intense rivalries in motorsport history with main opponent Alain Prost .
To mark what would have been his 50th birthday , AUTOSPORT has compiled a gallery covering Senna 's spectacular career , from his early successes in junior racing to the F1 triumphs that made him a hero around the world .

The usual image of Africa as a continent mired in conflict and squalor is unfair and misleading – like claiming that all Europeans are guilty of “ ethnic cleansing ” because of what happened in the former Yugoslavia .
Yes , African has some failed states , but most of its 53 countries are mostly peaceful , agreeable places .
First , we have this from Goldman 's Erik Nielsen this morning :
According to the Reuters story below , Merkel said this morning as a government declaration in front of the German parliament ( ahead of the EU summit ) that help to Greece would only come as the very last resort , and that it ( bilateral help ) would come ONLY in combination with the IMF .
Whether this was formally agreed yesterday by the Euro - zone heads of state remains uncertainly , but I think it is very likely .
If so , its just a matter of rubber stamping it in the full EU summit today , since none of the non-Eurozone EU members would object to the IMF being involved .

Berlin , 25 .
Mär ( Reuters ) - Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel sperrt sich unmittelbar vor dem EU - Gipfel weiter gegen direkte Finanzhilfen der EU an das hochverschuldete Griechenland .
Infrage kämen für die Bundesregierung im äußersten Notfall nur Hilfen des Internationalen Währungsfonds ( IWF ) in Kombination mit bilateralen Hilfen der Euro - Zone , sagte Merkel am Donnerstag in einer Regierungserklärung vor dem Bundestag in Berlin .
Dies sei dann der Fall , wenn die Stabilität eines Landes gefährdet sei und es keinen Zugang mehr zu den internationalen Finanzmärkten gebe .
" Aber ich sage nochmal : nur als Ultima Ratio " , unterstrich die Kanzlerin .
Sie werde beim Gipfel entschieden dafür eintreten , dass eine solche Lösung gelinge .
Merkel unterstrich , Griechenland sei bislang nicht zahlungsunfähig .
Das Land habe sich selbst ein ambitioniertes Sparprogramm auferlegt und zuletzt erfolgreich seine Anleihe an den Märkten platziert .
Die Kanzlerin warnte , der europäische Stabilitäts - und Wachstumspakt dürfe nicht aufgeweicht werden .
Deutschland sei sich seiner historischen Verantwortung bewusst .
Die Zahlungsunfähigkeit eines einzelnen Landes stelle ein gravierendes Risiko für alle anderen Euro - Länder dar .
Der Streit über Finanzhilfen für Griechenland sorgt seit Tagen für heftigen Streit in der EU .
Die EU - Kommission und viele Euro - Länder fordern , die Solidaritätserklärung an Griechenland vom Sondergipfel im Februar durch einen konkreten Hilfsplan der Euro - Länder mit Leben zu erfüllen .
Die Bundesregierung ist nur zu Hilfen bereit , wenn Griechenland sich an den Internationalen Währungsfonds wendet .

And then we have this from Erik from last night :
The much anticipated EU summit starts tomorrow and runs through Friday .
The agenda consists of discussions of employment ( specifically the new strategy for jobs and growth that is to replace the Lisbon strategy ) , the economy ( specifically the divergence in competitiveness and current accounts inside the EU ; hot topic these days , but expect no agreement on anything ) , and climate change ( a follow - up to Copenhagen , probably mostly focused on how Europe got so marginalised . )
In addition , the Greek crisis was supposed to be discussed at the summit – i.e. until ( 1 ) Merkel ( supported by the Netherlands and Finland ) called earlier this week for a more prominent role for the IMF , if help is required – a position sharply opposed ( at least until now ) by several countries , including France , the Commission and the ECB ; and ( 2 ) the EU presidency ( Spain ) , encouraged by France , called a pre-summit meeting today of the Euro - zone heads of state to address the now serious intra-European tensions on how to deal with Greece .
The point of today ’s meeting was clearly to settle the issue of the IMF ’s role ahead of the EU - wide summit , given that this would be the last opportunity for the leaders to discuss the matter before Greece might be running out of cash .
The Greek head of their debt office has said that they might be down at EUR7bn by the end of March .
If I am right on this , then a decision on Greece would most likely have been reached today , which means that an announcement could come already tonight , or relatively early tomorrow , Thursday , ahead of the EU summit .
And based on the news flows , one would have to expect that Merkel has gotten her way .
If so , this would constitute quite a defeat for what I have called the “ fiscal federalists ” .
In summary , I now expect a formal announcement by the EU - probably ahead of the formal EU summit tomorrow , Thursday - that if an Euro - zone member needs financial help , then the IMF will be asked to take the lead , both in terms of financing and with respect to policy conditionality .
Other EU countries might provide some co-financing like they have done to EU countries outside the Euro - zone , but this would be secondary .
It is not clear when Greece will formally approach the IMF , but it might happen within weeks , and very likely during the next few months .
I think negotiations – when they get under way – will focus on a program of about EUR20bn over 18 months .
Stay tuned .

As the figure shows , the overall power transfer efficiency of the wireless system can be increased by powering multiple devices simultaneously , rather than each device individually .
Using more than one device increases the coupling resonance .

A team of MIT physicists has developed a system that can wirelessly transfer power to multiple electronic devices simultaneously with high efficiency .
The system takes advantage of electromagnetic resonance coupling , and could be implemented by embedding a large copper coil in the wall or ceiling of a room .
Somewhat surprisingly , the physicists found that the overall efficiency of powering multiple devices can be significantly higher than the efficiency of powering each device by itself , as long as the system is properly tuned .
Physicists André Kurs , Robert Moffatt , and Marin Soljačić of MIT have published their study on the new wireless power transfer approach in a recent issue of Applied Physics Letters .
As the scientists explained , the new wireless power transfer system could satisfy mid-range applications by filling the gap between short - range inductive systems ( such as wireless power mats ) and long - range radiative systems , which are sensitive to obstructions , require complex tracking mechanisms , and pose safety risks .
“ The main goal of our research was to show that it is possible to transfer power between a source , which could be embedded in a wall , and receivers , which could potentially be embedded in actual devices , over distances comparable to the size of a room and with efficiencies that may be good enough for many real - life applications , ” Kurs told PhysOrg.com .
To demonstrate their new system , the physicists built a large self - resonant copper coil that resonated at an optimal frequency of 6.5 MHz .
The helix - shaped coil spans an area of about one square meter , and could be embedded in the walls or ceiling of a room .
The large coil , which serves as the resonant source for two smaller coils , could wirelessly transmit power to electronic devices located a few meters away , although efficiency decreases with distance .
The system works on the principle of electromagnetic resonance , in which all devices are resonating at the same frequency .
When this happens , the devices can transfer energy between themselves while interacting weakly with other off - resonant objects .
The researchers also showed that the cross-coupling between electronic devices is about 15 times smaller than the coupling between each device and the source coil , which is necessary for efficient power transfer .
Experimentally , the scientists showed that the system could supply more than 25 watts of power to each of two electronic devices located two meters or more from the source coil .
In addition , the researchers found that powering multiple devices simultaneously could increase the overall efficiency .
For example , the system could achieve power efficiencies greater than 50 % for multiple devices , whereas the power efficiency for a single device was less than 20 % .
Having multiple devices increases the coupling resonance , which leads to greater efficiency .
“ Before it is widely used , we need to embed the receivers in a seamless way into devices , ” Kurz said .
“ We would also like to make further improvements to the performance .
Perhaps someday it will find its way into many consumer applications . ”

The Symbian Foundation announced this week that the source code for the platform is now entirely open source software .
It is distributed under the terms of the permissive Eclipse Public License and can be modified and redistributed at no cost .
Symbian 's path to openness began in 2008 when Nokia , which already owned half of the company , acquired the rest of the shares .
In a partnership with other Symbian stakeholders , Nokia launched the independent Symbian Foundation with the aim of building a vendor - neutral ecosystem to advance the platform and facilitate its transition into an open source software project .
During the early stages of the transition , the code remained proprietary but was made available under royalty - free terms to members of the foundation .
Last year , the organization began the process of relicensing the platform 's source code , starting with Symbian 's EKA2 microkernel .
Virtually all of the remaining code has now been opened , several months ahead of the foundation 's original schedule .
The code has been published in Mercurial version control repositories that are hosted on the foundation 's Web server .
The foundation will soon be shifting its focus toward community - building efforts now that the code is freely available .
" The announcement that the Symbian platform is now wholly open source represents a unique moment for the mobile industry as a whole .
The most widely distributed smartphone platform , the biggest migration from proprietary to open source software in history ; delivered 4 months ahead of schedule , " wrote Haydn Shaughnessy , editor of the Symbian Foundation 's official blog .
" Now the platform is free for anyone to use and to contribute to .
It is not only a sophisticated software platform ,
It is also the focal point of a community .
And a lot of the foundation 's effort going forward will be to ensure the community grows and is supported in bringing great innovations to the platform and future devices . "
Although Symbian currently holds global dominance in the smartphone market , the platform is losing a lot of ground to major emerging competitors like the iPhone and Android .
The foundation has launched a wide range of technical initiatives to help ensure that Symbian remains relevant .
For example , a port of Nokia 's excellent Qt development framework will make Symbian application development a lot less ugly .
The foundation has also launched an Open Signed Online initiative which will allow developers by bypass the Symbian Signed program when they are testing their applications .
Despite these advancements , building and deploying software on Android is still a lot easier , and it's not totally clear if the Symbian Foundation 's best efforts will be able to fully close the gap .

Is your spiritual home right here on earth ?
Do you feel a deep sense of peace , belonging , gratitude and wonder in Nature or under a clear night sky ?
Then you may be a scientific pantheist .
Scientific pantheism focuses on saving the planet rather than “ saving ” souls .
It respects the rights of humans , and also of all living beings .
It encourages you to make the most and best of your one life here .
It values reason and the scientific method over adherence to ancient scriptures .
Take our popular quiz to find out if it suits you :- Are you Atheist , Agnostic , Pagan , Deist , Pantheist or What ?
Why you might like Scientific Pantheism
We relate closely to some of the central challenges of our era .
At a time when the balance of our Earth is under unprecedented threat , scientific pantheism is one of the few forms of spirituality in which Nature plays a central part .
For us , Nature is a source of peace and beauty , as well as the focus for our care and vigilance .
Nature was not created for us to use or abuse .
Nature created us , we are an inseparable part of her .
We have a duty to live sustainably , to care for Nature and to halt and reverse the harm that humans have done to her .
Scientific pantheism is the only form of spirituality we know of which fully embraces science as part of the human exploration of Earth and Cosmos .
We wonder at the picture of a vast , creative and often violent Universe revealed by the Hubble Space Telescope .
We regard stargazing as a spiritual practice .
We oppose climate change denial and evolution denial , especially in education .
Scientific pantheism has a joyous affirmative approach to life .
It has a healthy and positive attitude to sex and life in the body .
We wo n’t tell you what you should be smoking or doing in the bedroom .
We fully accept diverse gender choices , and we oppose all forms of discrimination .
Scientific pantheism moves beyond “ God ” and defines itself by positives .
Atheism and Agnosticism both define themselves negatively , in relation to a “ God ” that they deny or doubt .
These are useful starting points – but they do n’t take us very far .
Most people also need positive beliefs and feelings about their place in Nature and the wider Universe .
Scientific pantheists take Nature and the Universe as our start and finish point , not some preconceived idea of “ God . ”
We do not believe in a supernatural creator god who watches or judges us .
Most scientific pantheists avoid god-language or religious words like church , worship , divinity and so on .
We regard them as misleading in relation to pantheism .
Those of us who do like to use these words , use them metaphorically , as a way of expressing their deep feelings of reverence , gratitude and belonging towards Nature and the wider Universe .
Get the Scientific Pantheism handbook .
Our basic principles
Our beliefs and values are summarized in our Pantheist Statement of Principles .
The statement was drawn up by fallible humans .
It is not required dogma – it is simply a notice on our door , to show what we are about so people can decide if it suits them or if they want to learn more .
These are the key elements :
Reverence , awe , wonder and a feeling of belonging to Nature and the wider Universe .
Respect and active care for the rights of all humans and other living beings .
Celebration of our lives in our bodies on this beautiful earth as a joy and a privilege .
Strong naturalism – without belief in supernatural realms , afterlives , beings or forces .
Respect for reason , evidence and the scientific method as our best ways of understanding nature and the Cosmos .
Promotion of non-discrimination , religious tolerance , freedom of and from religion and complete separation of state and religion .
Spiritual but not religious
Many people feel the need to belong to a religious community .
Research shows that such groups provide mutual support and friends and are good for physical and mental health .
There ’s no good reason why groups of like - minded non-theistic folk should not enjoy similar benefits .
In the WPM we are spiritual but not religious .
We do n’t have churches , priests , or prescribed dogma and rituals .
But we do aim to provide a “ home base ” for people who love Nature and the Universe and do not believe in supernatural entities .
Two of the major benefits our members and friends say they value are gaining new like - minded friends and finding a place where they can share their enthusiasms without fear of being ostracized or feeling isolated .
There have been many local meetings of members across the USA and in other parts of the world , where people have found a rare level of fellowship and stimulation .
The WPM ’s short term goals are to :
Promote the values of environmental concern and human and animal rights .
Make earth - honoring life - affirming naturalistic beliefs widely available as a rational alternative to supernatural and theistic religions .
Promote forums for these beliefs and values on various Internet channels and other media .
Encourage local gatherings by providing fora for networking .
Support separation of church and state and freedom of religion ( including non-religion ) .
In the longer term , as resources permit , we hope to :
Build up numbers of members and friends in localities and promote the formation of longer - lasting local groups
Create a network of civil celebrants for Nature and life - oriented child dedications , weddings , and funerals
Sponsor Nature conservation activities and help members to conserve Nature
Actively address other issues such as women ’s rights , animal rights , science education including evolution and climate change , drug laws , dark skies , and more .
If you would like to help promote these goals , please consider becoming a WPM member .
Volunteering is another great way of supporting the WPM .
All who agree with our principles are encouraged to join our Facebook page ( with more than 160,000 fans ) , or join our Facebook discussion groupwith more than 10,000 members .
Closely allied beliefs
We use the name pantheism because the term encompasses a long and venerable history dating back to Heraclitus and Marcus Aurelius and extending to Einstein , D. H. Lawrence and beyond .
Our beliefs ( see the Statement of Principles ) are entirely compatible with atheism , humanism , agnosticism , universalism , and symbolic paganism ( viewing magic , gods and spirits as symbols rather than objective realities ) .
We offer a home to all forms of naturalistic spirituality however you may choose to label it .
Other paths that approximate include philosophical Taoism , modern Stoicism , Western forms of Buddhism that celebrate Nature and daily life without supernatural beliefs , and Unitarian Universalists who do not believe in supernatural beings .
You are free to adopt the terms and practices you prefer and draw on other traditions for inspiration or celebration .
Some call this a religion ( a positive one ) , while others call it a philosophy , a way of life , or a form of general spirituality .
It ’s up to you .

West Linn police are on the scenes of two related overnight robberies that began when three robbers disguised as ninjas broke into a home late Thursday afternoon .
Police say the robbers rang the bell at a row house in the 2200 - block of St. Moritz Loop in West Linn around 5 p.m .
When a woman answered door , the armed trio forced her to the top floor , tied her up and ransacked the home .
Then they laid in wait for her husband , Rick Rogoway , to come home several hours later , eventually forcing him to accompany them to his jewelry store , open the door and safes and watch them rob it .
West Linn police spokesman Sgt. Neil Hennelly says that after robbing the La Rog Brothers store in the 13000 - block of SE 84th Avenue in Clackamas , the thieves drove Rick Rogoway home , and tied him up before driving away in his silver 1999 3 - Series BMW , with Oregon tag WPR139 .
Both Rogoways were able to get free and call 9 - 1 - 1 from a neighbor 's home at 9:34 P.M .
" This was a targeted attack on this family and business " said Hennelly .
" This was not random at all . "
The robbery may sound familiar :
Officers from West Linn and Beaverton were comparing notes on the cases today , Hennelly said .

Three more women have been permitted to join a class - action lawsuit that accuses Bloomberg L.P. , the financial services and media company founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , of discriminating against pregnant employees , a federal judge said Thursday .
The three , who only came forward in the past couple of weeks , bring to 79 the number of plaintiffs in the case .
But Judge Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court in Manhattan , clearly eager to pick up the pace of the long - running case , declared that they would be the last three .
“ We have finished identifying claimants , and thus there will be no more claimants , ” Judge Preska said .
“ Discovery is complete . ”
The judge ’s comments came at the end of an unusually testy 90 - minute procedural hearing , in which both sides haggled over , and were frequently confused by , all sorts of legal and semantic arguments .
Lawyers rose with such animated regularity from their seats that they almost resembled pieces in a Whac - a - Mole game , prompting the judge to comment on their “ chest - beating . ”
Virtobot may be helping humanity now , but it'll know all our weaknesses when Skynet achieves sentience .
That 's because it 's the world 's first autopsy robot - and it can examine a dead body inside and out without ever lifting a scalpel .

The University of Bern 's Virtobot uses MRIs and computer tomography to take a 3D snapshot of a cadaver .
That allowing doctors to examine bodies without cutting into them , as well as preserve forensic data for years .
The press release for Virtobot explains how the machine captures a 3D picture of the body :
In the Virtopsy laboratory , it projects a light bar onto the corpse being examined .
The imaged body contours are recorded in high definition using a digital stereo camera .
At the same time , the Virtobot images the texture of the skin .
" Then we harmonise these surface images with the three - dimensional CR data of the entire body " , explains Lars Ebert , who programmed Virtobot as part of the National Centres of Competence in Research , Co- Me.
Forensic doctors are thus provided with a high - precision , three - dimensional image of the body and can examine it on - screen from all angles , both externally and internally .

And here 's a video of Virtobot in action :
Perhaps the best part of Virtobot is the fact that it 's totally mute .
This prevents it from spouting such nonsense diagnoses as " death by broken heart . "

The quest to turn the motion of the world 's waterways into a significant source of energy may still be in its nascent stage , but several tidal power projects are making headway .
Whether they operate in lakes , rivers or the oceans , projects attempting to harness the tides share the same mission : to improve the technology and offer an economical alternative to fossil fuels .
Renewable hydrokinetic power comes from a number of different sources , including the up - and - down motion of waves and the smooth flow of the tides caused by the sun and moon 's gravitational forces on Earth 's bodies of water .
Tidal power is seen as a promising source of energy because of its predictability and from the potential to draw it from ocean currents and estuary channels that connect rivers with the sea .
There are only a handful of tidal energy projects in place around the world , and none is producing commercially available electricity at this time .
Most of these projects use some sort of turbine to capture the tide 's kinetic motion .
In general , as the turbines slowly spin , they turn the gears in an attached gearbox to create electricity .
Cables connected to those gearboxes carry that electricity ashore .
Although it is unclear just how much electrical energy that the tides have the potential to generate , the Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) has studied several tidal power project sites .
In 2008 EPRI estimated those sites together have the potential for generating as much as 115 terawatt - hours of electricity annually , although the practical potential for energy generation from those sites is about 14 terawatt - hours per year .
( Total electricity consumption in the U.S. is about 4,000 terawatt - hours per annum , according to EPRI . )
Much of that energy would come from Alaska , thanks to high power density and large - size sites in southeast Alaska , Cook Inlet and the Aleutian Islands .
Other locations studied were in Maine , San Francisco and Washington State 's Puget Sound .
Although New York City and the Chesapeake Bay were not studied for the 2008 report , EPRI concluded these sites could also make use of tidal hydrokinetic energy resources .
RITE stuff
One of the more advanced tidal power operations in the U.S. is taking place in New York City 's East River , where the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy ( RITE ) project has been testing windmill - like turbines since 2006 .
Led by Verdant Power , the project installed six windmill - like turbines — each five meters in diameter and anchored to the bottom of the East River , about nine meters in depth — in the water next to Roosevelt Island , a sliver of land 3.2 kilometers long by 240 meters wide in the river between the boroughs of Manhattan and Queens .
" Verdant went with a design that looks like a conventional wind machine — an open rotor with three blades , " says Roger Bedard , an EPRI researcher who has studied water current–based energy generation .
This was a calculated move , given that wind is very commercially mature in terms of renewable energy sources , he adds .
After logging about 9,000 operational hours since being installed , all six original turbines were removed earlier this year and are being disassembled so Verdant can study their seals , bearings and other components for signs of wear .
In the meantime , Verdant is developing its next - generation turbines that will be very different from their predecessors .
Whereas Verdant 's original tidal turbines sat anchored individually to the riverbed , looking something like a field of underwater windmills , the new design will have three turbines operating on a triangular frame positioned on ( not anchored to ) the bottom of the river .
The company plans to place 10 triangular frames — a total of 30 turbines — on the river bottom .
Each of the new turbines will produce 35 kilowatts of power at the rated water speed , meaning that the 10 - frame installation should produce up to about one megawatt of power ( enough to provide electricity to roughly 800 homes ) .
This is , of course , if the company can get permission from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) .
Verdant has been operating with a preliminary FERC license and by August plans to apply for its full license , which the company needs in order to produce , deliver and sell one megawatt of commercial power .
Water - to - wire efficiency
Trey Taylor , Verdant 's president and head of marketing and business development , estimates his company 's turbines have a " water to wire " efficiency of about 40 percent , meaning that 40 percent of the overall water - flow energy turning the turbines is converted into electrical power on the grid .
For the RITE demonstration the power generated was provided to two locations on Roosevelt Island — a local supermarket and a parking garage .
Taylor likens his work at Roosevelt Island to another famous first step in the history of technology : " The East River is like our Kitty Hawk , " he says , " but eventually it will lead to our 747 . "
Verdant would like to place additional turbines in the waters around New York City .
The U.S. Coast Guard has even mentioned possibly placing turbines in the United Nations 's security zone in the East River , Taylor says .
" The U.N. seemed to like that because the turbines might discourage boats from driving into that zone , where there are n't supposed to be any boats , " Taylor says .
Verdant has obtained a preliminary permit from FERC to study the site for an installation that could produce up to five megawatts .
The water depth in that area could allow Verdant to install turbines that are seven meters in diameter , which Taylor estimates would translate into 110 kilowatts of power per turbine .
" Once we have studied the site and have applied project and economic modeling to the site , " he says , " we will engage the U.N. in discussions about building a project in its security zone .
The East River is just the beginning , according to Taylor , who says that the deeper , faster - flowing waters of the Saint Lawrence River that forms part of the border between New York State and Ontario , Canada , have the potential to produce three times as much energy as the RITE project .
A key distinction is that the Saint Lawrence is a steadily flowing river , unlike the East River that depends on a tide that flows either north or south depending on the time of day .
Taylor is hoping to be able to sell river - based power to Ontario in 2012 , giving his company two successful projects that might attract additional investors .
In a third key project , Verdant will work with the U.S. Navy in Puget Sound .
The Navy is studying Verdant 's triframe turbines for their potential to provide energy to naval bases worldwide , Taylor says .
Longer term , Taylor would like to install his company 's technology in developing countries , something that will require additional capital .
All together , Verdant expects to be producing 22,000 megawatts of power from its various installations by 2018 .
A test at a lock - and - dam system
Houston - based Hydro Green Energy likewise make hydrokinetic power systems that generate electricity from river currents , tidal currents and ocean currents .
The company struck a deal with City of Hastings , Minn. , in late 2008 to test Hydro Green Energy 's turbine technology at a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers lock - and - dam system on the Mississippi River .
Hydro Green CEO
Wayne Krouse 's goal was to develop a technology that could generate electricity without the need for more dams and that could be done at a cost comparable with electricity produced by burning fossil fuels .
That meant coming up with a compact , low - cost technology that required a minimal number of parts .
" In an offshore or saltwater environment , the more parts you have the more that could go wrong , " Krouse says .
Making the blades from plastics and carbon - fiber components rather than metal alloys was one solution .
Hydro Green is still working toward its goals .
The company 's prototype turbine operating in the Mississippi is about 3.7 meters in diameter with blades made from cast aluminum , which Krouse says is fine for freshwater but could pose a problem in salty ocean water .
The Hydro Green turbine uses flow from the nearby hydroelectric lock - and - dam system to simulate the marine tidal environment where the company wants to eventually operate .
About 30 cubic meters of water per second flow through the turbine at any given time .
At this point , Krouse is trying to keep his company 's turbine in the water as long as possible , logging the precious hours required to validate the technology 's design and durability .
Green Hydro received its FERC permit in December 2008 , and the 35 - kilowatt turbine went into the water in February 2009 .
Krouse , who says that getting the FERC permit is the biggest barrier to funding , estimates it will take anywhere from 10,000 to 25,000 hours of cumulative operation to attract the investment he needs to further develop the technology .
Hydro Green has applied for grants to get financial assistance to start up additional projects in Alaska and Mississippi .
Other tidal projects
OpenHydro Group , based in Dublin , Ireland , in November 2009 successfully deployed a 400 - ton in - stream tidal turbine in Canada 's Bay of Fundy , which has the world 's highest tides , on behalf of its customer , Nova Scotia Power .
The turbine , which rests at the bottom of the bay 's Minas Passage , is capable of producing one megawatt of power ( pdf ) .
East Yorkshire , England–based Lunar Energy in May 2009 announced that a one - megawatt commercial prototype of its turbine ( which was developed with the help of Rotech Tidal Turbine ) successfully synchronized to a simulated grid and produced electricity in testing on land .
Lunar Energy in 2008 began working with Korea Midland Power to create a 300 - turbine field in the Wando Hoenggan Water Way off the South Korean coast .
The plant is expected to provide 300 megawatts of renewable energy to Korea Midland Power by December 2015 .
A commercial prototype unit is also expected to be deployed at the European Marine Energy Center ( EMEC ) in Orkney over the next year .
Similarly , Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , announced in December that it will receive more than $ 9 million over three years from a U.S. Department of Energy competitive laboratory solicitation for the development of advanced water power technologies .
Sandia researchers are expected to evaluate new device designs and conduct basic research in materials , coatings , adhesives , hydrodynamics and manufacturing to assist industry in bringing efficient technologies to market .
Sandia will also evaluate environmental factors including rates of sediment transport , water flow , water quality and acoustic changes .
Regulatory challenges
Even though a lot of the testing taking place involves proving the turbines can work efficiently , the biggest roadblocks to making tidal energy commercially available are on the regulatory front .
" That 's not to say there are no engineering problems , " Bedard says , " but you need to put these devices in the water to test them . "
The money that start - ups must spend on environmental studies is a major barrier to getting a FERC license that would allow companies to test their turbines in a real body of water , as opposed to a laboratory tank .
Verdant has spent at least $ 9 million on its East River project , one third of which was expended on studies to gauge the potential impact of the turbines on ships traversing the channel , aquatic life and fish migration , according to Taylor .
The company has received some help from the government along the way in the form of state and federal funding .
Green Hydro had to study , among other things , the birds , fish and water quality ( including turbidity and dissolved oxygen ) around its City of Hastings installation , Krouse says , adding that the amount of research needed to get the FERC license was " onerous . "
The fish study cost $ 400,000 , whereas for the bird research it was another $ 45,000 , he says .
" A true commercial project cannot afford to deal with the government , " Bedard says .
" For these projects to be real and supply real power , there needs to be a process that will allow for the economical development . "
A Brooklyn cop has accused the NYPD of under - reporting and refusing to investigate crimes in order to keep crime statistics down .
Officer Adrian Schoolcraft alleges that cops in the Bedford - Stuyvesant 's 81st Precinct have deliberately recorded felonies as misdemeanors and turned some victims away so crime rates at Ralph Avenue stationhouse appear lower .
" I wanted to become a police officer , chase the bad guys , and I thought the NYPD was the best police department in the world , " said the Texas native , who joined the NYPD in 2002 because he wanted to serve after the Sept. 11 attacks .
" I never thought it would turn out like this . "
To back up his claims , Schoolcraft gave the Daily News the names of 14 crime victims who tried to report crimes at the 81st Precinct , where the crime rate has dropped 17 percent over the past two years .
In interviews , five victims backed up Schoolcraft 's allegations , three said police responded correctly , four could not be reached , and two initially agreed that police had erred , though they could n't be reached for follow - up interviews .
Here are some of the allegations :
Even though burglars left a hole in his door , police allegedly would n't take a 79 - year - old man 's report because there was " no evidence . "
After thieves stole a 65 - year - old woman 's car , cops purportedly refused to file a report .
Though perps " kicked , pummeled and even tried to suffocate " a 27 - year - old man in a mugging , officers apparently classified the attack as " lost property . "
The Internal Affairs Bureau and the Quality Assurance Division are now investigating Schoolcraft 's allegations , which he claims have made him quite unpopular on the force .
The seven - year veteran has been suspended since Halloween for leaving work an hour early without permission , then getting into an altercation with other cops about that suspension .
After the confrontation , he was deemed unstable and committed to a psychiatric unit at Jamaica Center for more than six days — a move he told the Post was payback for coming forward .
A person reportedly " familiar with a psychiatric assessment " of Schoolcraft told the News : " He does n't understand the police culture .
Is he insane ?
Is he psychotic ?
Is he manic ?
Absolutely not .
I think he can be believed . "
The Australian Greens were looking for a way to " knock on the head " internet filtering legislation to be introduced to Parliament as early as this month , according to Western Australian Senator Scott Ludlam .
Speaking at the Kickstart Forum [ see photo gallery ] , Ludlam predicted that the Federal Opposition would also attempt to stall the introduction of the legislation , but he said the Opposition 's policy position on the issue remained unclear .
He believed the Opposition was planning to block most legislation in the Senate .
He described the tactic as " cynical " , as it could make it seem the Government had not achieved anything by the time the Federal election was called later this year .
" The Senate at the moment could be politely described as constipated , " he said .
" It is very difficult to pass anything through there at the moment - partly because there is a huge mass of complex legislation that is supposed to be going through .
" We will probably get the Telstra bill passed but I am going to predict right now that the net filter bill will not be on the table before the election - and i think probably they are going to struggle to get the broadband legislation through . "
Ludlam said his party 's goal was to have the Government rethink its proposed introduction of ISP - level filtering .

You will then be able to configure how much storage to use on the device , up to 16 GB .
The remaining space on the flash drive will be accessible by your PC or Mac. USB
Hard drives may work , but like flash memory , you ’ll only be able to use up to 16 GB of space .
Everyone has annoying habits , and a sizable part of every successful marriage is learning to live with those things each other does that annoy you .
I think it 's safe to say , too , that geeks have some habits that we think are awesome , but that non-geeks find a little ... less awesome .
Now my wife is a geek , but she 's not as much of a geek as I am , so I asked her for some help putting together a list of ten things geeks do that annoy their spouses .
She was perhaps a little too enthusiastic about helping out , but here are the results :
1. Punning - I remember when I was young , and thought that I must be the only geek ( well , possibly nerd at that point ) who loved to pun .
Then I went to my first science fiction convention , and quickly learned that not only was I wrong , but that there were plenty of far worse offenders than I .
That gave me something to aspire to , of course , which I did for a while .
Since college , I 've scaled back on the relentless punning I used to practice , but I 'm sure I 'll never quit completely .
2. Using " frak , " or Klingon , or both , instead of regular swear words - Yes , this is a marvelous way to avoid accidentally using real , English swear words in front of the kids .
I suspect that 's one of the reasons it can be annoying to others , though : it 's like a loophole in the no-swearing - in - front - of - the - kids rule .
I caught my wife using " frak " the other day , now that she 's gotten into Battlestar Galactica , too ( yes , just as it's about to end ) , but she claims to have done that just to make me smile and says it still annoys her when I do it .
Still , I figure she'd be more annoyed by my using real swear words , so I think I 'll stick with it .
3 . Weird or over - the - top ways of celebrating mainstream holidays - Geeks rarely do anything by halves , as anyone who 's ever been to a costume contest at a major sci - fi convention can attest .
So if we want to celebrate something we 're likely to go all - out .
This can mean going to great lengths with Halloween decorations , or , as I 've done several times , making tentative plans to serve rabbit for Easter dinner and venison for Christmas dinner ( yes , I know , reindeer are caribou , but it 's close enough ) .
No , I 've never carried through on these threats plans , but when the kids are old enough not to be upset by the joke I might just .
I do insist on playing Tom Lehrer 's Christmas Carol at least once each December .
4. Dissecting movies - Geeks , in my experience ( and myself included ) , have a habit of picking movies apart , particularly just after watching them .
We will discuss everything from the special effects to the minutiae of costume and prop design , but what gives us the most pleasure is identifying plot holes ( no matter how small ) , anachronisms , and goofs in general , and , in adaptations , picking apart the cuts and modifications .
For some reason , this tends to annoy non-geeks who , I guess , do n't enjoy the process .
5 . Wearing obscurely geeky T - shirts to " normal " places - Every geek has at least a few of these ; do n't try to deny it .
We love them , because we get the jokes and we know that only other geeks will get them , too .
Unfortunately , they can make our less geeky significant others feel a bit conspicuous when out with us — or maybe they feel the geekiness will rub off on them , I 'm not quite sure .
Still , I feel that if I have to occasionally let my daughter wear a Hello Kitty shirt out of the house , I can wear my shirts from ThinkGeek .
6 . Requiring extra room in the house for geeky things -
Not all geeks have exactly the same space needs , but we 've all got more than most people .
There are the comic book collections accumulated over several decades , the stacks of board games and RPGs , and the old computer equipment that might be useful someday , you never know !
Some of us need just a good - size closet or two , some of us need a room , and some of us take over the entire basement .
For some strange reason , the people we live with tend to get a little annoyed at this .
7 . Geeky toys and decorations can be hard to explain to kids - Long has my plush vorpal bunny languished atop a tall bookcase , waiting for the day when my kids are old enough not to be scared by its huge bloody fangs .
And how to properly explain my model of Minas Tirith to kids not quite old enough for The Lord of the Rings ?
I mean , if we say " You remember The Hobbit ?
Well , it 's in the same world , but a country not mentioned in that book , and it figures heavily in a later story , " that will only prompt a thousand questions about it .
That 's not a bad thing , of course , but it can get a bit tiresome .
At least the Warner Brothers cartoon sericels hanging on the walls are easily explained by simply putting in a DVD .
8. Looking up information while a discussion / argument is still in progress -
So what are laptops and mobile phones for , if not to resolve disputes or questions wherever you happen to be ?
Why would anyone get annoyed when you pull out your iPhone in the middle of a discussion about , say , a news story , and a minute later break back into the conversation with the details of the story that everyone else had forgotten ?
Yeah , it beats me , too , but my wife insists this belongs on the list .
9 . Needing to watch certain TV shows ASAP to avoid spoilers -
It 's tough enough to find decent geeky shows on TV these days ; think of how much worse it would be to accidentally hear or see a spoiler for an episode before you 'd had a chance to watch it .
And keeping away from
Twitter and Facebook and other social websites and services in case a spoiler happens to come across it just is n't viable for that long because , let 's face it , we 're geeks and we 're addicted to the internet .
Non -geeks have shows they 're addicted to , too , of course , but , at least in my experience , not to quite the same extent .
10 .
Geeky projects that take over the house and whole weekends -
We 've done dozens of posts on projects big and small , from hacking IKEA bunk - beds to DIY iPhone stands .
Some geek projects are simple and wo n't take but a few minutes , and some just seem to take every bit of available space in your house .
I think most spouses of geeks at least understand this behavior , but I suspect it annoys them more than they let on .
So , any additions to the list ?
Any spouses of geeks out there want to add a few of their own pet peeves ?
Please leave a comment .

Enver Gjokaj played Victor ( and a whole bunch of other characters ) on Joss Whedon 's much - missed show Dollhouse .
Now he 's following in Whedon 's footsteps , launching a new webseries called Previously On Point Dume .
He told us it 's " Twin Peaks meets Clue . "
Advertisement
Previously On Point Dume 's first brief video taste will go online on Monday , via FunnyOrDie , but we got a sneak peek at it , and a chance to talk to one of our favorite Dollhouse stars .
Point Dume is a made - up soap opera about a community full of tawdry secrets , in which strange supernatural events are happening and the dead sometimes rise again .
It 's hilarious and tongue in cheek , with just the right amount of campiness and silliness — it did remind me a lot of Clue , actually .
Here 's the official synopsis :
Something is hiding in the wealthy beach enclave of Point Dume .
A dark secret so so secretive it could take at least five seasons to reveal .
When big city - boy Lazlo Wood returns home for his father 's funeral , his nosy questions threaten to dig up more than just a corpse .
What exactly is his step - mother Ginabeth hiding in the pantry ?
What exactly is Professor Pyle injecting local children with ?
And when exactly will Bron the Landscapist ever wear a shirt ?
These and other mysteries promise to almost never be explained in this new recap show for the greatest nighttime soap opera never seen , Point Dume .
Advertisement
Gjokaj plays the " Lothario landscapist , " Ron , as well as Ron 's nemesis / doppleganger , Bron .
And indeed , he never wears a shirt , and the first segment includes full - on Enver - on - Enver action .
" They 're kind of like enemies - slash - weirdly attracted to each other , because thye 're both complete egomaniacs , " explains Gjokaj .
" We 've got some bizarre things planned . "
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Every " webisode " will be a " Previously On Point Dume " style collection of clips from the previous episodes — and there 'll never be a full - length episode , at least not for the foreseeable future .
Instead , you 'll see the soap - opera parody 's storyline unfold through these little recaps .
" I love soaps , " Gjokaj tells us .
" I always wanted to make one . "
But soap operas always have ridiculous storylines , with " inadvertent incest and paternity issues , " not to mention characters dying and coming back all the time , and that seemed ripe for parody .
Advertisement
Gjokaj had been getting together with a group of friends and doing theater pieces together in their spare time between acting gigs .
" Usually , we get people together and get them drunk at a bar , and do something fun and just creative , " he explains .
" We decided this time around , instead of doing a theater piece , to do an internet piece . "
He adds :
We 're definitely not Joss here , but I was inspired by Joss and by Felicia , the way they got out ahead of the ball on the cutting edge of controlling their content .
Advertisement
" Mostly , it 's just for fun .
We 're just trying to have fun and stay creative ourselves , " says Gjokaj .
" One of the hardest things about being an actor is , you have to wait until someone else says you can work .
In order not to go insane , you have to have something , just on the side , that 's light and fun and playful , and just an outlet , " as opposed to endless auditions .
Advertisement
So now Gjokaj and his collaborators will wait and see if people like their " recap of actual episodes that do n't exist , " before hopefully going on to shoot other ones .
" What I 've learned shooting this and learning to produce ... is that it takes a lot of work , " says Gjokaj .
But after making a lot of mistakes with greenscreen the first time around , his crew has learned a lot about how to do it easily , and he thinks the next installments will go a lot quicker .
" Going forward , we 've learned so much , we can't wait to get back into the greenscreen , because we made things so much more difficult than they needed to be .
It 's really fun to work on greenscreen .
It 's fast , and you can get really easily throw some random picture into the background and see how it looks . "
" If all goes well , we 'll ramp up production pretty much immediately . "
He hopes to get the next four episodes / recaps shot in late May or early June .
Advertisement
One thing the creators of Point Dume were insistent up on was that the series must have an actual plot that makes sense .
That was one of the things we agreed upon when we started doing this .
A lot of us did n't find internet sketches too funny , because they tend to be so random all the time .
We wanted to play this a little bit straighter and a little bit more on - the - nose , and less over the top , even though over the top things are happening ...
One of the things we are sending up and satirizing on the show are things like Lost , where it goes on forever .
[ On Point Dume ] , there 's always something crazy going on , and we 're not going to try too hard to come up and explain it , because Lost certainly does n't .
Advertisement
Sadly when Gjokaj tells people the series is Twin Peaks meets Clue , " to our insane anger ... nobody knows either of those things . "
But he adds , " if you do n't know either of those , maybe it 's just not for you .
You 're missing out anyway .
You 've got bigger problems . "
Meanwhile , Gjokaj is shooting a guest spot on Lie To Me , where he has some war flashbacks , similar to the ones in Dollhouse .
He also has a movie called Stone coming up in May , where he plays a younger version of Robert DeNiro 's character in flashbacks .
" I 'm kind of looking for the next project , " adds Gjokaj .
" It 's really hard , after Joss , to find a show you want to do . "
He 's already turned down some projects because they did n't seem like the right step after Dollhouse .
" Dollhouse was an amazing experience for me . "

A North Carolina public school teacher has been suspended for writing the word “ loser ” on a 6th grade student ’s notebook .
“ He thought it was funny , the kids thought it was funny … our school district does n’t think it ’s funny , ” said Jan Blunt , Communications Director for Buncombe County Schools .
Rex Roland , who is a social studies teacher at Enka Middle School , was suspended without pay for two weeks , Blunt said .
Roland , who has been a faculty member for 12 years , was being playful with the student when he wrote “ loser ” on the girl ’s papers , Blunt told CNN .
“ She laughed .
She knew it was joke , ” Blunt said of the child , “ but her parent called the superintendent to complain . ”
CNN was unable to reach the student ’s parent for comment .
Blunt said the principal was informed of the matter and last week removed the student from Roland ’s classroom .
Blunt also believed the incident has been blown out of proportion .
" This is a teacher who is kind of a jokester at the school , ” Blunt said , “ and his way of relating to his 6th and 7th grade students is to joke with them in their own context , and kids this day call themselves all sorts of things , including loser .
That ’s been his methodology for some time but it ’s not appropriate in the school district . ”
“ He just jokes around , all of the students have come forward to talk about him in a favorable way to say he ’s just being funny .
He was just kidding . ”
She added that Roland has reportedly been receiving death threats .
Buncombe County Schools District issued the following statement in response to the controversy :
" Regardless of the intention or context , demeaning or derogatory comments made to students by school staff is unacceptable and will not be rationalized or justified by Buncombe County Schools .
Following a thorough and comprehensive investigation , Buncombe County Schools Superintendent Tony Baldwin has announced that Enka Middle School social studies teacher Rex Roland will be suspended for two weeks without pay , with a required component for training in professional and ethical classroom behavior before he returns to the school .
Mr. Roland has been an employee with the school system since August of 1997 . "
A letter from Roland and Enka Middle School Principal Dr. Pam Fourtenbary was sent today to students , parents , faculty and staff .
“ The past few days have been stressful for all of us at Enka Middle School , but it is time to
heal , unite and become an even stronger school community than before .
Thank you for your support and contribution to this process , ” the letter said .
“ To help in the healing , Mr. Roland would like to extend a full apology to any and all students
or staff he may have offended due to his unprofessional behavior .
He regrets the negative
impact that his behavior has had on our school ’s integrity and reputation , and would like you
to know that he will be attending training to improve his professional and ethical classroom
behavior .
Mr. Roland looks forward to returning to his students at the end of that training
and a 10 - day suspension .
It is very important for everyone to know that Enka Middle School is a safe place for
students and staff alike , and that Buncombe County Schools does not tolerate demeaning
or disparaging behavior of any kind , by anyone , toward anyone .
If at any time a student ,
parent or staff member has a concern over this or any other issue , it is important that you
feel comfortable bringing that concern to my attention .
Please be assured that your
concerns will be addressed properly and in a timely manner . ”

Public conviction about the threat of climate change has declined sharply after months of questions over the science and growing disillusionment with government action , a leading British poll has found .
The proportion of adults who believe climate change is " definitely " a reality dropped by 30 % over the last year , from 44 % to 31 % , in the latest survey by Ipsos Mori .
Overall around nine out of 10 people questioned still appear to accept some degree of global warming .
But the steep drop in those without doubts will raise fears that it will be harder to persuade the public to support actions to curb the problem , particularly higher prices for energy and other goods .
The true level of doubt is also probably underestimated because the poll only questioned 16 to 64 - year - olds .
People over 65 are more likely to be sceptical , the researchers said .
" It 's going to be a hard sell to make people make changes to their behaviours unless there 's something else in it for them - [ such as ] energy efficiency measures saving money on fuel bills , " said Edward Langley , Ipsos Mori 's head of environment research .
" It 's a hard sell to tell people not to fly off for weekends away if you 're not wholly convinced by the links .
Even people who are [ convinced ] still do it . "
John Sauven , the executive director of Greenpeace , said concern about fluctuations in public opinion have also prompted many environment groups to re-think their approach to campaigning - which has often focused on threats of climate disaster and making people feel guilty for their part in it .
" All of us have [ talked about these changes ] , " said Sauven .
" A lot of [ recent ] headlines have been grossly distorted , but that does n't get away from the fact it 's quite a complex issue , so we have got to talk about what is engaging and positive in terms of the response [ which ] can have many benefits to our society , for example energy security . "
The latest poll , taken at the end of January , follows two months of allegations that climate scientists might have manipulated and withheld data , and the contradiction of facts in the influential 2007 report on the science and impacts of climate change by the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
However , evidence that these events are behind the increased public uncertainty is mixed .
Russ Lidstone , chief executive of the advertising agency Euro RSCG , which commissioned the Ipsos Mori survey , said their research among consumers found " great cynicism now as a result of questions in popular culture and regarding credibility of IPCC data " .
However a recent poll for the BBC suggested that these events have had less influence on British public opinion than the cold winter .
Adding to the confusion , Lidstone said that the agency 's focus groups also showed the public was becoming " desensitised " to unseasonal weather and dramatic events like flooding .
Another likely factor was government action - or inaction - including the perceived failure of the climate talks in Copenhagen at the end of last year .
Langley said : " That 's something we do hear when we 're doing dialogue work with the public : if this is a serious issue , then why are n't politicians taking it more seriously ?
But obviously that can be a way for them [ voters ] to detract responsibilty from themselves . "
Just over 1,000 people in Great Britain were questioned on their views on climate change as part of Ipsos Mori 's regular online omnibus poll on a range of issues .
The results are weighted to reflect social groups and the split between men and women .
Thirty one percent of those polled said climate change was " definitely " happening , while 29 % said it " it 's looking like it could be a reality " , and another 31 % said the problem was exaggerated , a category which rose by 50 % compared to a year ago .
Only 6 % said climate change was not happening at all , and 3 % said they did not know .
Providing succor to those who believe that public opinion on the issue is largely fixed and that fears of a decline in public confidence are exaggerated , nearly half of the poll group said they " strongly agree " or " tend to agree " that climate change is a threat to all life on earth .
The response to the question on the causes of climate change could also reflect a more sophisticated understanding of climate science among the public than is sometimes assumed .
Nearly one in five said climate change was " man-made " , half that number said it was the result of " natural causes " , and two - thirds said it was caused by a mixture of the two - putting the majority in line with scientists ' conviction that the current global warming is predominantly man-made , but also influenced by natural factors such as the Sun 's activity .
Climate change also dropped significantly down the list of voters ' biggest concerns , ranking in the top three for only 17 % of voters , nearly half the number in December 2007 soon after the IPCC 's major assessment and another influential report on the the economics of climate change by Lord Stern for the UK government .
This lower priority could reflect the long - term nature of the impacts of climate change in the UK .
In addition , people 's priorities had changed significantly as a result of the economic downturn , focusing instead on unemployment and household budgets , said Lidstone .
However , Lidstone warned businesses not to react too quickly to changing public opinion and roll back moves towards cutting energy use and other sustainability policies .
" It is easy for some companies to believe sustainability will not be key to consumer decisions , but ultimately consumers will continue to want to know a brand or business track record on all elements of corporate responsibility , " he said .
The BBC poll by Populus , published earlier this month , found that 25 % of people thought climate change was not happening , compared with 15 % in November last year .
Last month , the climate secretary , Ed Miliband , urged the public not to turn against the " overwhelming " evidence that the global temperature is rising faster than before and that human actions , particularly burning fossil fuels , are largely to blame .
" We know there 's a physical effect of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leading to higher temperatures , that 's a question of physics ; we know CO2 concentrations are at their highest for 6,000 years ; we know there are observed increases in temperatures ; and we know there are observed effects that point to the existence of human - made climate change , " Miliband told the Observer .
" That 's what the vast majority of scientists tell us . "

The following sentence was deleted from the original because it was based on incorrect information provided :
Another finding by the poll that hints at a growing lack of public confidence is a significant drop in those who said climate change was caused by human activities .
One year ago this number was one in three , but this year just one in five people believes global warming to be man-made .
Barack Obama , Former CIA Agent
- by Deanna Spingola , 14 Mar. 2010
I recently had the pleasure of talking with Dr. James David Manning who has been ministering to the people of Harlem since 1981 .
He is now the Senior Pastor at ATLAH which stands for All the Land Anointed Holy , Manning ’s inspired name for Harlem as of September 14 , 1991 .
Dr. Manning heads the Columbia Obama Treason Trial which is scheduled for May 14 - 19 , 2010 at the ATLAH building at 38 West 123rd Street in ATLAH , New York , 10027 .
Unfortunately , the Department of Justice and the Supreme Court have failed in their duties to uphold the Constitution and address the legitimacy and other questionable issues surrounding the White House ’s current resident .
So , Dr. Manning , being a longtime resident of the Columbia University area , the school that Obama allegedly attended , began an intense investigation into Obama ’s educational background and discovered some profound discrepancies .
According to Dr. Manning , Obama ( born in 1961 ) enrolled at the very pricey Occidental College in Los Angeles , California in 1979 and was recruited there in 1980 by the CIA which has made it a practice since its inception to recruit college students .
He was , by his own admission , a “ C ” student , a dope smoker and a member of the Marxist Club at Occidental , a co-educational liberal arts college .
In 1981 , Obama allegedly transferred from Occidental to Columbia University .
It is atypical for a student to begin their education in one four - year school and then transfer to another school .
Columbia University requires that incoming students pass certain academic requirements which Obama apparently lacked .
However , Columbia had a foreign student program and the CIA has major connections and influence with Columbia and the nation ’s other educational facilities .
The CIA needed Muslims or others who were fluent in Farsi and who could easily blend into the Muslim environment in the Middle East .
The CIA persuaded Columbia University to extend their foreign student program to Obama , now a Columbia student , so that he might travel to Pakistan and enroll in the universities around Karachi in addition to the Patrice Lumumba School in Moscow .
1
The school , one of Russia ’s most prestigious universities was founded on February 5 , 1960 as The Peoples ’ Friendship University of Russia ( PFUR ) .
It was renamed the Patrice Lumumba School on February 22 , 1961 .
On February 5 , 1992 the university re-adopted its former name .
According to their web site , “ The main aim was to give young people from Asia , Africa and Latin America , especially from poor families , an opportunity to get University education and to become highly qualified specialists .
The students were admitted through non-governmental organizations , governmental establishments , and the USSR embassies and consulates . ”
2
Obama , as an undercover agent , was the lead agent in the arms and money supply for the CIA - trained Taliban Army against the Soviet Army war machine .
His actions were integral to the Taliban ’s success in their opposition to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan .
Obama , it is publicly acknowledged , went to Pakistan in 1981 .
There is no way of knowing how often Obama traveled between Pakistan and Russia .
According to Dr. Manning , Obama was an interpreter for the CIA during the war in Afghanistan .
When Obama completed his CIA operations in the mid 1980s and returned to the U.S. he persuaded the State Department to maneuver his entrance into Harvard Law School ; since the CIA , the U.S. president ’s personal agency for black operations throughout the world , also has connections to federal and state politicians , they managed to arrange Obama ’s entrance to yet another elite school in 1988 .
Percy Ellis Sutton , a civil - rights activist and lawyer , was the Manhattan Borough President from 1966 to 1977 .
He was an intelligence officer with the Tuskegee Airmen , the name of a group of African American pilots who were part of the 332nd Fighter Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II .
Sutton entered Harlem politics and became a leader of the Harlem Clubhouse , known as the “ Gang of Four ” which has controlled Democratic politics in Harlem for at least fifty years .
His Clubhouse allies were New York City Mayor David Dinkins , U.S. Representative Charles Rangel , and New York Secretary of State Basil Paterson , father of the currently beleaguered David Paterson who replaced Spitzer as New York Governor in 2008 .
Percy Sutton wrote a letter to Harvard officials requesting that they admit Obama as a student after a hiatus of five years ( from 1983 when he allegedly left Columbia to 1988 ) .
Despite a five - year absence from the rigors of college activity he was accepted at Harvard where he excelled and on February 5 , 1990 , was elected president of the venerable celebrated Harvard Law Review , the highest student position at Harvard Law School , a term that lasts for one year .
3
After graduation he could have worked in any leading law firm except that he lacked the proper citizenship qualifications which would have come to light during the interview and normal background checks pursued by major law firms .
Moreover , his academic deficiencies at Occidental College would have disqualified him from the top law firms .
Furthermore , he was a CIA operative in the Middle East during the time that he was supposed to be attending Columbia University .
So despite his Harvard achievements , Obama became a Saul Alinsky - style community organizer in South Chicago which alleviated the necessity of providing a legitimate background check .
4
In 1990 , Obama accepted a job with Davis , Miner , Barnhill & Galland , a law firm which represented civil rights cases but also represented Rezmar Corp. owned by Chicago slumlord , Tony Rezko .
The law firm helped Rezmar Corp .
get more than $ 43 million in government funding .
As early as 1995 , Rezko started contributing to Obama for his political aspirations .
In 2003 , Rezko was a fundraiser for Obama ’s Senatorial campaign as part of a group that raised over $ 14 million .
In 2006 , Rezko was found guilty of sixteen out of twenty - four charges filed against him .
Barack Obama had been employed for a short summer stint as an associate with Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP , the same law firm that Harvard graduate Michelle Robinson worked for from 1988 to 1991 .
She became his trainer and supervisor and , as such , may have handled any background information .
Michelle Robinson , through the efforts of Valerie Jarrett , then - deputy chief of staff for Mayor Richard Daley , became an assistant to the mayor .
Robinson later became an “ economic development coordinator . ”
Obama married the politically connected Michelle Robinson in October 1992 in the Trinity United Church of Christ .
This gave him citizenship and credibility .5
In 1993 , according to the Records at the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois , Michelle Obama , as an attorney , was “ voluntarily inactive and not authorized to practice law ” per her request .
After she gave up her law license , Michelle Obama worked for the University of Chicago Medical Center where she received a very generous annual salary of $ 317,000.6
Dr. Manning , an African American , has called Obama a “ good House Negro ” and a “ long - legged Mack daddy , ” and an “ emissary of the devil . ”
When Dr. Manning gave an interview on Fox News , he said , “ We also have to talk about his character . ”
Dr. Manning has also questioned Obama ’s eligibility to serve as U.S. President due to the fact that Obama has not complied with numerous requests by to reveal his birth records .
In fact , Obama has spent thousands of dollars in an attempt to conceal those records .
Dr. Manning , using information from hired investigators declares that Obama never attended Columbia University .
He asserts the following :
1 ) “ Columbia University will not divulge whether the “ alleged ” diploma issued was in the name of Barry Soetoro or Barack Hussein Obama .
No public record exists regarding the diploma . ”
2 ) “ Obama alleges he attended Columbia in 1982 , 1983 .
But , the investigators have been UNABLE to turn up a single shred of written documentation for the years 1981 , 1982 , 1983 , 1984 that show where Obama appeared on a school roster , register , faculty memo , bulletin board , school awards , dean ’s list ; where Obama ’s name appeared in a yearbook , club record , fraternity record , extra curricular activity member roster , student newspaper , student radio or TV activity ; where Obama appeared in any records as a worker , employee , laborer in or about Columbia University ; where Obama enrolled in any sports activity or program . ”
3 ) “ As a graduating senior in 1983 he does not appear in any Political Science ( his major ) or Graduating Class yearbook or invitation records . ”
4 ) “ There is absolutely no documentation of any kind to show Obama attended , lived , worked or played at Columbia University during the investigated 4 years . ”
5 ) “ Interviewed professors , college employees , students ( who were at Columbia during the years in question ) have failed to turn up a single person that can remember Obama .
This is irrefutable evidence .
Think about your own situation if Obama had attended your college ?
A “ now - famous ” person went to your school ?
Many would be able to say , “ Of course I remember . ”
At Columbia , not a single person has been able to say he or she remembers Obama . ”

Obama ’s background would have been relatively insignificant if he had n’t been chosen as a presidential candidate by the bankers .
But , with funding from George Soros and other international bankers who wish to establish global governance , he ran for office .
Obviously there would be records that revealed some very personal details of his life .
Passport records are particularly revealing .
John O. Brennan , Obama ’s top terrorism and intelligence adviser is the owner of The Analysis Corp. , the firm that was cited in March 2008 for penetrating the files of presidential candidates Barack Obama , Hillary Rodham Clinton , and John McCain in the State Department ’s passport office .
Investigators maintain that the target of this illegal activity was Obama ’s passport file for the sole purpose of cleansing the records of information that would jeopardize Obama ’s candidacy .
The breach of the passport records of the other candidates was to create confusion .
Brennan was , at the time , an unpaid advisor working with Obama ’s campaign .
Passport files include an applicant ’s name , gender , social security number , date and place of birth , and passport number .
Additional information may include birth certificates , naturalization certificates , or oaths of allegiance for U.S. - born persons who adopted the citizenship of a foreign country as minors .
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee oversees the State Department .
Joseph Biden , now Obama ’s Vice President , was the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time of the breach .
8
The State Department passport records were scrubbed to erase any mention of Obama ’s CIA activities and his personal information .
The State Department employee , Lt. Quarle Harris , Jr. who had access and apparently scrubbed the records , was killed .
9 Harris decided to cooperate with the FBI who was investigating the break - in .
His body was discovered in his parked car ; he had been shot in the head , execution style .
10 The Indonesian passport , issued in the name of Barry Soetoro , was used to travel to Pakistan to assist the Afghan Mujahideen during the U.S. buildup.11
The CIA is not an intelligence - gathering agency .
The Truman Administration authorized “ psychological warfare ” by the newly established National Security Council in NSC 4 - A of December 1947 which allowed covert operations during peacetime .
This document made the CIA Director responsible for psychological warfare and placed it under the exclusive direction of the Executive Branch .
The CIA has unvouchered funds which allow the agency to operate without exposure or Congressional oversight .
12
With pressure from the Departments of State and Defense , a new NSC directive , NSC 10/2 was issued on June 18 , 1948 .
This new directive stipulated that the CIA could conduct “ covert ” and “ psychological ” operations both of which were sponsored by the U.S. Government against foreign states or groups .
However , these activities should be “ planned and executed in such a way as to provide plausible deniability if revealed .
Approved CIA clandestine activities , according to the directive , include “ propaganda ; economic warfare ; preventive direct action , including sabotage , demolition and evacuation measures ; subversion against hostile states , including assistance to underground resistance movements , guerrillas and refugee liberation groups , and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world .
Such operations should not include armed conflict by recognized military forces , espionage , counter - espionage , and cover and deception for military operations .
” 13
During the 2008 presidential change - promising campaign Obama avoided detailed questions about his alleged years at Columbia by saying that he was very anti-social and totally uninvolved with the academic community .
Further , he claimed that he lived off campus .
For someone who loves the limelight and never misses an opportunity to engage in rhetoric , it is an enigma that he would isolate himself from typical college activities unless , of course , that is simply justification to account for his absence during the time that he was supposed to be attending Columbia .
Okay , if Obama was a CIA operative who , with political connections , super funding and media puffing , made it to the White House – is he still a CIA operative bent on destroying what is left of the economy of the U.S. ?
The CIA was established by Harry Truman , a 33rd Degree Freemason , to implement global governance .
Freemasonry is a front group for the satanical organization , the Illuminati whose objectives are world governance .
In mid February 2010 , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs alerted the reporters who regularly cover the White House that certain questions were forbidden including Obama ’s job with CIA front company , Business International Corporation ( BIC ) , following his attendance at Columbia University ; Obama ’s school records while he attended Occidental College in Los Angeles from 1979 to 1981 , and his records at Columbia .
14 Wayne Madsen states that his Kabul sources claim that President Obama has maintained a personal correspondence with a private military company ( PMC ) whose senior personnel includes numerous Afghan Mujahideen - Soviet war veterans who fought with the late Northern Alliance commander Ahmad Shah Massoud who became Afghanistan ’s Defense Minister in 1992 and was assassinated on September 9 , 2001 , allegedly by al - Qaeda agents .
The firm is also involved in counter - insurgency operations in Colombia , where Obama is building seven new military bases , and in Iraq .
Henry Kissinger said , “ Conflicts across the globe and an international respect for Barack Obama have created the perfect setting for establishment of ‘ a New World Order .
” 15 Allegedly , the upper echelon of Freemasonry were infiltrated long ago by the Satanic Illuminati whose objective is world dominance through one - world governance .
There are claims that Barack Obama is a 32nd degree Prince Hall Freemason .
Certainly , Prince Hall Freemasons , Jesse Jackson and Charles Rangel , supported his presidency .
16 Whether he is a Freemason or not , he might indeed be the chosen vessel of the New World Order proponents unless the citizens call a halt to the scheme .
However , there is no doubt that he is a Zionist asset and , that despite his campaign promises , intends to pursue the same Neo - Con policies in the Middle East as the previous administration , as evidenced by his speech before the 2008 AIPAC Policy Conference where he was introduced by his friend , Lee Rosenberg , a fellow Chicago resident .
17
Dr. Manning hopes that thousands of people will support this effort , one that will benefit every single American .

Yesterday we introduced you to the collision event displays used by Large Hadron Collider physicists , and explained one type of display used by the CMS experiment .
Today we ’ll delve into the details of this ATLAS experiment event display .
First things first
Check out the title and text at the bottom left of the event display .
The ATLAS Experiment logo lets you know which particle physics collaboration produced the display – an important distinction when there are four massive experiments recording and analyzing LHC collision data .
Next , the title tells you what type of collision event you ’re viewing .
This event display shows the production of jets from the collision of two protons , each of which had an energy of 1.18 trillion electron volts ( TeV ) .
Jets — sprays of particles that fly out from certain high - energy collisions — indicate that two protons have collided head - on .
These violent collisions are the ones that are likely to produce new , heavy particles , and thus physicists expect to see jets in the signatures of almost every interesting LHC collision .
Finally , there is the date , time , run and event numbers .
This collision was recorded on December 14 , 2009 at 4:30 a.m. Central European
Time ( the time zone of the CERN laboratory in Geneva , Switzerland ) .
Run and event numbers are used by physicists to catalog their data .
Run numbers are unique .
The first ATLAS run was recorded years before the LHC circulated its first beam , and run number will increase throughout the decades - long life of ATLAS .
The event number resets to zero every time a new run starts .
Split screens
Now let ’s move on to the display itself .
This event display shows three different views of the same proton collision .
The three views help convey all the information about a three - dimensional event on a two - dimensional surface .
Physicists on ATLAS use interactive versions of this and other event displays to delve deeply into the details of any collision event .
Static images such as the one decoded here are created to be shown to scientists from other collaborations and the general public , and thus may be cropped , rotated , or differently colored compared to the views the physicists use on a daily basis .
View A shows the ATLAS detector from the side .
Onto this lengthwise slice of the ATLAS detector is projected all of the information collected by the different detector systems .
View B shows a beams - eye view of the ATLAS detector .
All of the information collected by the different detector systems is projected onto this cross - wise slice of the detector .
View C shows information only from two of ATLAS ’ detector systems , the calorimeters .
The different detector systems are not shown in this view .
Breaking down views A and B
The ATLAS detector is made up of a number of smaller sub - detector systems that each specialize in measuring certain properties of certain types of particle .
The colors of the sub - detector systems are consistent between views A and B .
1 : Collision point
Shows the point at which two protons collided in this event .
2 : Direction of the particle beams
In view A , the proton beams enter from either side of the detector , cross at the collision point and exit through the opposite side of the detector .
In view B , the proton beams travel into and out of the display through the collision point .
3 : Tracking detectors
The innermost portion of the ATLAS detector contains three systems dedicated to measuring the momentum of charged particles : the pixel detector ; semiconductor tracker ; and transition radiation tracker .
( To view the tracking detectors in detail , we recommend opening the event display in a new window and enlarging it . )
Zooming in close to the collision point you see the pixel detector in grey and black .
In view A the pixel detector is directly above and below the collision point ( 1 ) ; in view B it directly surrounds the collision point .
Slightly farther from the collision point , also shown in grey and black , is the semiconductor tracker .
In both the pixel detector and semiconductor tracker , the passage of a particle is indicated by a colored square .
Grey squares show activity in part of the detector that , after more analysis , was not determined to be of interest to physicists .
Black squares indicate no activity in that area of the detector .
Zooming out even more you see the transition radiation tracker in purple .
Colored lines that radiate from the collision point through the transition radiation tracker show the passage of a particle that registered in all three tracking detectors .
4 : Central solenoid magnet
The ATLAS detector contains two large magnet systems .
The innermost magnet ( green ) is the central solenoid , which curves the tracks of particles as they pass through the tracking detectors .
The curvature can be seen in view B , but not in view A , as the magnetic field bends the paths of particles in some directions but not others ( in this case , paths are bent perpendicular to the proton beam direction ) .
Magnetic fields help scientists measure the momentum of charged particles ; the more curved the particle track , the lower the particle ’s momentum .
They also help scientists tell particles apart , as particles with opposite charge bend in opposite directions in the same magnetic field .
The second – and much larger - toroid magnet system is not shown in the event display .
This magnet system bends the paths of particles through the outer portions of the ATLAS detector .
5 : Liquid argon calorimeter
This detector , shown in grey , measures the energies of electromagnetic particles such as electrons and photons .
Energy deposits left by particles are shown as yellow rectangles .
Electrons can be distinguished from photons by the presence or absence of associated tracks in the tracking detectors .
Electrons , which are charged , will leave a track before depositing their energy in the liquid argon calorimeter , while photons will leave no track .
6 : Tile calorimeter
This detector , shown in red , measures the energies of hadronic particles such as protons and neutrons .
Energy deposits are again indicated by yellow rectangles .
Charged hadrons — such as protons — will leave a track in the tracking detectors before depositing their energy in the tile calorimeter , while neutral hadrons — such as neutrons — will not .
7 : Muon spectrometer
The muon spectrometer ( blue ) measures the passage of muons , heavy particles that do not stop in either of the calorimeters .
The muon spectrometer is only partially shown in this event display , as this collision did not produce muons .
When muons are created in a collision event , they will leave tracks in the tracking systems , and may deposit energy in one or both calorimeters before interacting with the muon system and ultimately traveling out of the detector .
View C – the Lego plot
While views A and B show information from all parts of the ATLAS detector , view C shows only the energy deposits left by particles in the liquid argon calorimeter ( red bars ) and tile calorimeter ( green bars ) .
This view gives an immediate impression of how much energy was carried away from the collision by a particle or jet .
This type of view is known as a “ Lego plot ” by physicists , as it stacks the energy collected by the calorimeters on top of each other .
Yellow circles indicate clusters of energy deposited by particles or jets .
View C takes the guesswork out of matching energy deposits with each other .
Presented only with views A and B , it would be very difficult for you to tell which clusters of energy deposits are associated with a given particle .
In view B , for example , energy deposits that appear to be right next to each other — and thus associated with the same particle — could be located at opposite ends of the detector when seen in view A. View C shows the energy as a function of two other parameters called η and φ , which are related to the location of particles along and around the detector .
Bringing it all together – a jet
The white circles labeled by the number 8 shows how the same jet of particles looks in the three different views .
The circles mark only the energy deposited by the jet in the calorimeters .
Tracing back to the collision point in views A and B , you can also see associated tracks left by the particles in the jet as they passed through the tracking detectors before stopping and depositing all their energy in the calorimeters .
That ’s it for this ATLAS event display .

And stay tuned for tomorrow 's introduction to the LHC Page 1 display , which will help you follow the LHC accelerator as it ramps up to 7 TeV collisions .
Unter dem Schutz des europäischen Markenamtes wird künftig Bier mit dem zünftigen Namen " Fucking Hell " gebraut - benannt nach dem kleinen Ort Fucking in Österreich .
Die Brüsseler Bürokraten mussten nach anfänglichem Widerstand dem Namen zustimmen - obwohl es in Fucking gar keine Brauerei gibt .
Wer würde bei einem solchen Ortsschild auf dumme Gedanken kommen ?
Das europäische Markenamt hat für ein Bier aus dem österreichischen Ort Fucking den Namen " Fucking Hell " gebilligt .
Die Eintragung als Marke könne nicht dadurch vereitelt werden , dass der Name " in anderen Sprachen eine zweideutige Bedeutung " besitzen könne , so das Amt .
Die mit der Eintragung beauftragte Berliner Marketing - Firma hatte den Namen , der auf Englisch einen vulgären Fluch wie " Verdammte Hölle " bedeuten würde , mit dem Namen des Standortes der Brauerei bei Salzburg begründet .
" Hell " beziehe sich auf die Farbe des Bieres .
Das Bier soll im August oder September präsentiert werden .
Zunächst hatte das Amt die Marken - Eintragung noch zurückgewiesen .
Zu den Regeln für die Eintragung gehört , dass die Namen nicht blasphemisch oder abfällig sein dürfen .
Nach dem Widerspruch des Unternehmens lenkte es mit dem Verweis auf den echten Ortsnamen ein .
Der Fuckinger Bürgermeister Franz Meindl ( ÖVP ) ist über das große Interesse an seinem Ort derweil genervt .
Weil immer wieder Ortsschilder geklaut wurden , mussten die Wegweiser bereits einbetoniert werden .
Die Nachricht , dass es in seinem 90 - Seelen - Dorf Bier gebraut werden soll , überraschte ihn .
Weder in Fucking noch in der Nachbargemeinde gebe es eine Brauerei , sagte er dem ORF .
Bei aller Aufregung wollen die Fuckinger an ihrem Ortsnamen festhalten .
Eine Änderung lehnten die Bürger in einem Referendum 2004 ab .
Opinion US Health Care -- Good for America , a Burden for the World ?
Obama 's historic health care package is the most important reform America has seen in decades , and it will ensure that 95 percent of Americans get access to coverage .
But what is good for the US may not be positive for the president himself -- nor for the rest of the world .
The new law will dominate discussion in the run-up to mid-term elections , and pressing global issues will be neglected .

DS Gilroy said : " We are glad to have disturbed this activity and restored normality to the neighbourhood .
We would also like to thank residents who reported the activity to us . "
If there is one key message coming out of the final day of the conference — staying cognitively active and physically active is our best defence against age - related brain failure !
Dr. Torkel Klingberg ( Karolinska Institute , Sweden ) presented promising data showing intensive cognitive training interventions can improve attention deficits ( working memory ) in children with ADHD and in healthy older adults .
Dr. Lars Nyberg ( Umea University , Sweden ) , a former post doc at the Rotman Research Institute — presented data from a large study that has followed the physical and cognitive health of over 4,000 adults aged 35 – 80 years during a two - decade period to see when brain failure starts to show .
He found that the decline starts gradually around the mid 30s and then nose - dives around 60 - 65 years of age .
But if there is a silver lining here , it is that all older adults are not alike in this trajectory .
Studies have found variability of cognitive performance .
In fact , there have been “ rare ” cases of spontaneous positive reversals of decline in this age group .
Could cognitive training encourage this “ reversal ” in more adults ?
That is an exciting question that scientists are starting to probe .
One member of the audience suggested that the sharp decline in cognitive powers that appears to hit around age 60 or so , could be related to the time when older adults typically start to retire .
Dr. Nyberg agreed that may be a possible predictor and would require more research .
He added that science is already showing that “ level of education ” is a strong predictor of cognitive health in later years .
Dr. Art Kramer ( University of Illinois ) , who is internationally renowned for his research looking at the effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive and brain health , opened his presentation with a simple but powerful refrain – “ use it or lose it ”
The good news , he said , is that levels of cognitive performance are “ malleable ” and “ open to enhancement ” throughout the human lifespan .
That presents all of us with an incredible opportunity .
The challenge , however , is to develop cognitive training exercises or games that do n’t just target one specific cognitive domain ( such as memory ) , but can generalize to other domains associated with “ speed ” and “ reasoning ” — all the cognitive functions we rely on everyday in our busy lives .
How well do the current crop of brain fitness games work , he asked aloud .
“ The breadth of transfer of training to everyday life is usually quite narrow , ” he cautioned .
What about video games ?
Dr. Kramer pointed to studies that have shown that playing commercial video games such as “ Medal of Honor ” seem to strengthen a variety of cognitive processes .
Moreover , the games are adaptive and increase in difficulty as the player gets better .
A group of older adults were trained on the video game “ Rise of Nations ” , which is a time strategy game that requires the player to build a civilization .
It ’s a strategic thinking game that challenges the player to schedule , plan and manage resources .
The older adults were given 24 hours of training over a month .
Results showed a positive effect across various cognitive domains .
Dr. Kramer also mentioned a John Hopkins study that measured the physical , cognitive and social benefits of older retired volunteers helping out in inner city schools in Baltimore for a minimum of 15 hours a week .
The results were very positive .
Baycrest is currently leading a study called BRAVO with boomer volunteers that sounds very similar .
Dr. Kramer has conducted research to see whether aerobic exercise in older adults can engender structural brain changes .
Adults who participated in a six - month exercise program showed increased volumes in grey and white matter , compared to a control group that was n’t exercising .
Hippocampal volume has also shown increases with aerobic exercise .
Even a regular and brisk walking routine can have benefits for cognitive and brain health .

Statism ≠ Socialism ; Pro-Market ≠ Pro-Business
In a recent column Sheldon Richman treated right - wing mouth frothing about Obama ’s “ socialism ” and “ Marxism ” with exactly the dismissive tone it deserves :
“ Despite what some popular right - wing talk - show hosts claim , Obama is not pushing Marxism , revolutionary or otherwise .
The threat is not from socialism in the sense of State ownership of the means of production , much less a proletarian uprising .
Rather , he ’s pushing good old American progressive - corporate elitism , or corporatism .
( Some would simply call it capitalism . )
It is anti-free market , but not anti-business . ”
If Goldman - Sachs and the auto industry are the new hotbeds of socialism , it ’s been a remarkably successful ideology .
It ’s a success comparable converting the largest cotton planters in South Carolina to abolitionism ca. 1850 — while they continued to work their plantations with slave labor .
There used to be a joke in the old Soviet Union about how Leonid Brezhnev proudly showed off his dacha , his car , and his GUM department store shopping privileges , etc. , to his mother .
When his growing uneasiness in the face of his mom ’s silence finally became too much , Brezhnev brought the issue to a head : “ Mama , are n’t you pleased that I ’ve done so well ? ”
“ Well , of course I ’m proud of you , Lyonya .
But what will happen to you if those awful Communists ever take over ? ”
Government interventionism does not equate to “ socialism , ” any more than being in favor of free markets implies a “ pro-business ” stance .
Business interests are some of the biggest supporters of state intervention in the economy , and some of its biggest beneficiaries .
Carlos Watson , at Fast Company , made the mistake of equating libertarianism to the interests of the business community .
The best thing that could happen to libertarianism , he said , would be if some prominent CEOs joined the movement .
“ If Libertarians want to have a real impact in 2010 or 2012 , they need to recruit from the business world , where their values will resonate most .
Places like Silicon Valley , Austin , and Seattle .
You do n’t have to look far to find high - profile CEO types who are likely Libertarians hiding out in the major parties . ”
Um , where exactly did Watson get the idea libertarian “ values ” would “ resonate the most ” in the business world ?
From what I ’ve seen , the business world ’s values are reflected in the remarks of former ADM chief Dwayne Andreas :
*” Tell me , what do they do for us in Bulgaria ?
Do they fix the prices ?
Or is there some kind of a free market ? ”
*” There is n’t one grain of anything in the world that is sold in a free market .
Not one !
The only place you see a free market is in the speeches of politicians . ”
*“ The competitor is our friend , the customer is our enemy . ”
Watson ’s proposals sound like the kiss of death for libertarianism ’s credibility for anyone who does n’t see workers and consumers as just a bunch of parasitic moochers propped up by Galtian supermen like J. Montgomery Burns .
It ’s the perfect recipe for branding libertarians as “ pot- smoking Republicans ” till the end of time .
Silicon Valley CEOs ?
Austin and Seattle ?
Sure — I ’ll bet the folks at HP and Microsoft are just champing at the bit to scale back the digital copyright regime and the rest of our draconian “ intellectual property ” laws .
While he ’s at it , why not some execs from the music and movie industries ?
Or maybe some Monsanto and Cargill execs who ’d like to play the United Fruit role in a remake of Guatemala , to “ protect the free market ” with gunboat diplomacy ?
The single biggest way corporate CEOs could remove the stigma of “ free market libertarianism ” ( falsely so - called ) among the general public would be if somebody leaked internal corporate memos to the effect that genuine free markets would hurt their profits .
We need another Dwayne Andreas / Ken Lay type to privately write , in so many words , that “ government regulation enables us to fuck Grandma Millie ” and that “ the free market is our enemy . ”
But if Watson had his way , the libertarian strategy would be to attract people like Lay and Andreas who see fake free markets as a way to HELP them fuck Grandma Millie .
That would be a “ victory ” for libertarianism , I guess — if it were the equivalent of an “ abolitionist ” movement that preferred recruiting plantation owners to freeing slaves .
Make Your Money Work for You
During his stupid escapades while on cannabis and God knows what else time as “ The World ’s Most Hated Blogger ” , Casey Serin left behind a ton of written garbage a couple hundred blog posts .
But he also recorded his voice .
Where he explains how he committed fraud .
How he lied in his mortgage applications .
And why he thought he did n’t deserve to go to jail .
I wonder if some enterprising police agency may still be interested in capturing this criminal – because someone found almost the entire Casey Serin recordings !
It ’s almost all of it – from the earliest Talkshoe adventures , to his brain - dead schemes to buy an Island in 2012 , to the HaterzCast , to …
The elusive Marty Casts .
You see , back in 2007 or so Casey wanted to write a book – “ The Foreclosure Code ” .
This is what his would - be publisher said about him :
Foreclosure Code Book :
When , or if , it Will be Released
There has been a lot of speculation and drama this past week whether or not this book will be published , with , or without Casey .
As of today , still no direct contact with Casey for going on five days .
With our company name and reputation , and my personal name and reputation , defamed all over the internet , as a result of being associated with Casey , with apparently many of the leaks coming from Casey himself , multiple breaches of contract , copyrighted material taken , plus , an enormous amount of wasted time , money , and energy , silence can be kept no more .
Nevertheless , 6 recordings were made of Casey Serin babbling , in intimate detail , about how he defrauded banks , private lenders and his own family in order to lose 2.2 million dollars in the end .
These recordings have it all .
If you are able to listen to all of them , you are in for a big surprise .

Negative advertising works , but only when it strikes a chord with what voters already think
Negative election advertising has made an early debut on the big poster sites in the 2010 campaign .
Do we think it 's inevitable , desirable or potentially regrettable ?
All three , I 'd say .
The Conservatives seem to have got the knocking stuff out there first with this weekend 's beaming mugshots of Gordon Brown – always a scary sight – but the Observer 's report that ministers plan to target George Osborne as the Tory " weakest link " suggests that Labour will not be far behind .
Indeed , David Cameron's " lack of substance " will also be a recurring theme .
As things stand , Labour 's new pledge card – five pledges on a sun-drenched background of a field of ripening corn was dismissed by the Guardian 's creative designer , Mark Porter , as having " all the boldness of a muesli advert " in Saturday 's edition .
Labour has made a virtue of sticking with its advertising agency , Saatchi & Saatchi , which is – as I 'm sure you know – no longer owned by the Saatchi brothers , Charles and Maurice , who were behind Margaret Thatcher 's lethal " Labour is n't working posters " in the 1979 campaign .
More interesting , as Patrick Wintour reports today , is the fact that ministers – and Saatchis – are trying to engage supporters in designing winning posters , some of which will go up on digital sites .
This is an attempt to adjust top - down messages to an interactive age .
There 's a lot of pent - up creativity out there , as the graffiti response to last month 's airbrushed (? )
Cameron / NHS poster demonstrated .
The Tories have been running soft ads for weeks , ones in which assorted voters – of all ages , shapes and colours – are seen saying things like : " I 've never voted Tory , but I like their promise to … " improve health , education etc .
I clocked several on the London - bound end of the M4 / A4 yesterday .
But since their poll lead has shrunk in recent weeks , they generated headlines last week by rehiring what is now M&C Saatchi – ie Lord Maurice S and Mr Nigella Lawson – who are regarded as more aggressive .
I can't believe they have had time to dream up the new crop that you may have seen on 24/7 rolling news – the place where most " posters " are really meant to be seen nowadays .
But the Daily Mail , which obligingly prints them all today , says they did .
The text that accompanies Brown 's smiling face says things like " I caused record youth unemployment , vote for me " , " I doubled the national debt , vote for me " and " I let 80,000 criminals out early , vote for me " .
And so on .
Actually , I inserted the commas there .
The Saatchi text has no punctuation .
" Vote for Dave and we 'll get rid of punctuation " is therefore one legitimate response .
But there are others that make this series a bit risky , I 'd say .
Youth unemployment ?
Well , it 's disappointingly high despite all the money pumped in .
But was it better before 1997 ?
National debt ?
Might Tory - voting bankers have had something to do with that ?
I think they might .
There 's " I took billions from pensions vote for me " , but , as we all know if we think about it , the real hit on pensions was not chancellor Brown 's removal of generous tax arrangements – building on an earlier Tory Treasury policy , incidentally – it was the collapse of the stockmarket , the ending of final salary schemes ( including mine ) and other belated admissions that we could n't afford what we thought we could when old people died so much younger .
People are n't stupid .
They know these things .
See how the recent " death tax " tombstone ad backfired .
Everyone knows there 's a problem with social care for the elderly that the winning party must address .
" Death tax " talk is crude , as Cameron will find if he tries to tackle it – as he must .
As for Maurice and Charles 's " I increased the gap between rich and poor vote for me " Brown poster , that is a jaw - dropping example of chutzpah that would probably be disbarred by the advertising standards authority .
The income / wealth gap in 1997 was dramatically wider than in 1979 .
Labour 's efforts to close it have been conducted while running up a down escalator .
The statistics are disputed , but valuable gains have been made at the bottom .
It 's the escalating accumulation of wealth at the very top of the top that distorts the figures and much else .
Yet the very newspapers that denounce Alistair Darling 's " class warfare " efforts to claw some money back from the top 1 % of earners or people buying £ 1 m houses will also be the papers that parrot this allegation .
They already do .
In today 's Mail , my old chum Peter Oborne takes Labour 's five pledges – the ones in the sunlit cornfield – and solemnly denounces them as " a mixture of pious aspiration , lies and outright fabrication .
It is essential that they are exposed . "
I 'm sure it is and trust that other souls , equally zealous for the public good , will make a similarly selective analysis of Dave ' n ' George 's pledges .
Me , I 'll stick to chutzpah .
Meanwhile , my working hypothesis is that we all deplore negative advertising while being reluctant to admit , even to ourselves , that it often works .
When does it work ?
When it strikes a chord with what voters already think and articulates half - felt impressions .
Thus the Tory " demon eyes " ad about Tony Blair in 1997 , ridiculously camp I thought at the time , was laughed off in a way it might not have been in 2005 .
Whereas William Hague in a Thatcher wig ( 2001 ) was both witty and true – still is .
On the other hand , I have often written that Hague 's " You paid the taxes , so where are the … " nurses , GPs , police officers , teachers etc poster was a very good one .
It was just inappropriate in 2001 when voters were still giving Labour the benefit of the doubt and Billy himself was crying " save the pound " up and down Britain .
Will Cameron 's attacks on Brown work ?
It 's too early to say , as it is to be sure – as some people claim to be – that George Osborne , who faces Darling and Vince Cable in tonight 's C4 debate – is the Tory weak link .
When Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt interviewed the PM for Saturday 's Guardian – at dawn in Brussels for the EU summit – they found him much more cheerful and outgoing than they could recall .
Make of that what you will .
Perhaps he knows that his fate will be decided – one way or the other – within the next month and is encouraged by the prospect of resolution , like a medieval knight facing single combat to resolve issues of courage and character which have dogged his life .
Either way , I 'm still minded to say the Tories ought to win this election , negative posters or not , though they are doing their best to make it interesting – and to keep Gordon 's spirits up .

SOMETIME around AD 1600 , Galileo Galilei is supposed to have climbed to the top of the leaning tower of Pisa and dropped two cannonballs of different sizes and weights over the edge .
The point was to test Aristotle ’s hypothesis that the speed at which objects fall would be proportional to their weight .
If Aristotle was correct , a cannonball 10 times as heavy as another would fall 10 times as fast .
Galileo , in fact , believed that in the absence of air …

“ Coming soon ” pages are a great way to tide over your visitors until you finish your new website .
They can be used as a teaser for your future website , or places to simply put your information where people can get to it while you are under digital construction .
We are going to look at a collection of how websites are successfully using “ coming soon ” pages .
1. SquidChef
SquidChef has a cute under - the - sea theme and an illustrated squid character to go with their name “ SquidChef ” .
Having a character illustration like this almost ensures that the site is going to have a friendly feel .
( Check out some more illustrated character designs ) .
I also like the idea of putting all the information into the talk bubble .
2. Accentuate
I like the color scheme of this “ coming soon site ” .
It ’s a simple theme that uses pink to highlight the important areas .
The colors go well with the simple layout of the website and the image of the chairs makes the website more interesting than just having text .
Having an illustrated look to a website usually gives it more of a fun and laidback feel .
It has a bright and welcoming color palette , and I like how the headings in the three sections in the footer are different colors .
It makes the color flow throughout .
4. Rumble Labs
Usually when you say “ hello ” right off the bat , it gives off a friendly vibe , and despite the dark background , this page gives that endearing feeling .
The bright highlight colors help emphasize that point , as well as the arrow and dotted lines .
I like the hovering logo – it creates a sort of 3D look , which gives the page a little more dimension .
Also , what makes this site interesting is that when you hover over the logo and Twitter icon with your mouse , it displays more information .
( Learn how to create 3D text via this tutorial ) .
The brightly colored quirky illustration gives a good sense of what the style of work could be , or at the very least , gives fun laidback feel .
The sign that says , “ summer ” integrated into the illustration gives a hint as to when the website will launch .
7. Berengere Monin
This website has a very nice clean and simple look .
I like the Asian - inspired style , with the tree / plant on the right and the black , white and red color scheme .
It gives the “ coming soon ” page a nice sense of simplicity .
8. Birdboxx
This is a successful illustrated “ coming soon ” web page .
This site pours out a peaceful and calming character with the green colors and the white dove .
I like the sketchy - style of this soon - to - launch page .
Not only is it a fun layout , but it is also useful , with the “ be updated ” web form mixed in to the design .
This “ coming soon ” page gives you ways of keeping in touch , by including Twitter and email options into the composition .
The color palette is what really draws me to this website .
The colors have a slight retro feel ( learn how to create a retro color scheme ) , but it still gives off a bright , clean , vibrant feel .
In addition , I like how the last post from their blog is displayed on the left .
I like the paint splatter effect , which they use to draw attention to the important parts of the layout .
They also use some bright colors to emphasize certain areas like the headline , and the green play button which is used for the RSS email feed .
12 . Mogulista
This website gives off a glamorous countenance , and that is probably because the business is geared towards women , who typically find these sorts of theme appealing .
What really struck me about this “ coming soon ” site was the navigation .
They use a nice animation that keeps you on the same page but rolls in and out new text below the logo .
13 . Dialed Tone
I like the usage of the 3D dial , as well as the shadows on the “ coming soon ” box and the sign up button , which give the site a lot more dimension .
14 . Evert Slagter
The icons are a nice touch considering they work with mobile user experience .
I also like the simplicity and the subtle light glow in the background that gives it a little more depth that just having a black background .
15 . Chuck Barrett
I think when I look at this , I immediately get an idea for what kind of style of fashion will be on the future website with the black and white photo .
I also like the idea of having the icons in grayscale , which goes with the photo , and how , when you hover over them , they change to colored .
16 . Jon Ward
At first glance , this is your run -of - the - mill name , logo , and title “ coming soon ” page , but if you stay on it for a second or two , you ’ll notice that where the job title is , is actually an animation that rotates the title , email and phone number .
It ’s a great way to present that little bit more information , and at the same time keep the page as simple , but engaging , as possible .
The logo has a techno look to it , which was why it drew me to the site in the first place .
It turns out that it ’s for a poetry publication .
Regardless , the logo , which gives this “ coming soon ” page a nice dose of color , is spectacular .
18 . Johnny Walker Plumbing
I love how simple the look is , but you can still get the impression that he is a plumber at someone ’s house fixing their flooded toilet or sink .
It is simple but effective .
19 . DesignSvn
I always love good Photoshop lighting work , and this website has it working really well with the web 2.0ish Twitter and subscribe icons .
Other than the 3D effects , I really like how the bright fresh colors make the website stand out .
21 . Handsome and Gorgeous Clothing
I think that it is important to showcase your merchandise , even if your website is n’t finished yet .
I also like the use of the jagged edge , giving it a layered fabric feel , which is appropriate for what they are selling .
22 . The Republic
I like the white design with the subtle cityscape at the bottom ; it gives it an interesting look .
I also like how they use gray colors instead of the typical black on white , which gives it a less harsh look and helps to make the logo mark stand out more .
23 . Gimmr
Not only does this “ coming soon ” page have a color scheme that I really like , it also has a unique feature .
You can upload a photo of yourself and add glasses to your portrait so you can look like the character / mascot to the left ( which you can then use as your avatar ) .
This is another website that uses some nice lighting effects , and the purple colors give it a night feel that goes perfectly with their name ( myNightlife ) .
It seems like they are using their “ coming soon ” page as more of a teaser , not really saying what they ’re all about .
All I can gather is that it has something to do with about movies ( probably ) .

A single mum who kept a diary recording the 191 times she had sex with a 12 - year - old was jailed yesterday for nine years .
Angela Sullivan , 36 , used a star to mark each time she bedded her young victim .
She even rewarded him with a pair of trainers once they ’d slept together 100 times , prosecutor Richard Bennett said .
The mum - of - one was caught after the boy started bragging online about his prowess , Teesside crown court heard .
In one posting he wrote about “ taking my bitch to bed ” and described what he intended to do , the court heard .
Friends nicknamed the boy Manballs and there were rumours Sullivan was pregnant before police were eventually called in .
Mr Bennett told how the abuse started during a party at Sullivan ’s home in Middlesbrough .
He said : “ Alcohol , including spirits , was available and it seems the young children at the party were freely able to consume it .
During the course of the party the defendant said to the boy , ‘ Are you daring ?
Are you a devil ?
Are you game ? ’
She tried to kiss the boy but he pulled away . ”
The boy , who cannot be named , had 10 bottles of vodka - based drink WKD and told police he was “ really drunk ” .
Mr Bennett said there was no doubt Sullivan knew the boy ’s age when she took him upstairs and had intercourse .
The court heard the pair had sex 191 times over 10 months , with Sullivan often sending her son away at weekends so
that she could be with the boy .
Mr Bennett said Sullivan ’s diary entry for May 17 when they ’d had sex for the 76th time read : “ Come on . ”
On August 1 when they ’d had sex for the 174th time she wrote : “ Got to reach 200 . ”
Mr Bennett said Sullivan ’s son saw the pair in bed together and was also exposed to mobile footage of them having sex .
Andrew Turton , mitigating , said Sullivan accepted she had done wrong , but stressed that the boy was a “ willing participant ” .
Judge John Walford , who ordered Sullivan to stay on the sex offenders ’ register for life , described the case as shocking .
He said : “ You took advantage of this boy ’s age .
I accept you did not ply him with drink , but to allow him to drink , to become intoxicated , is in my judgment shameful . ”
The judge condemned Sullivan for the psychological effect her conduct would have on the victim and her own son .
Acting DI John Wrintmore , of Cleveland police , said outside court : “ Sullivan preyed on and took advantage of a vulnerable boy .
This sentence clearly demonstrates the consequences of such actions . ”
During the last couple of years , as the world has gone through turbulence having almost faced the worst recession of all times , the consumers have become wary of investments .
The plastic - card happy consumer is embarking on an era of thrift .
Today , as the consumers are saving more , they also want more value for every penny spent .
To add to these woes the depleting material resource base across the world and increasing global population ( expected to touch 9 billion by 2050 ) has only meant that the cost of living will increase significantly in the future .
It would thus take a walloping effort from organizations and policy makers across the world to repudiate the Malthusian theory .
One such solution that could address the concerns raised above has been captured by an eminent Indian thinker , R.A Mashelkar .
According to him what ’s going to be crucial for the 21st century is Gandhian Engineering ; which is all about getting “ More for Less for More ” ( M4L4 M ) – more value for less cost for more and more people .
This is possible only through a change in mindset of organizations across the world where they focus on innovation .
However , this innovation has to be more of disruptive and less of incremental .
The last few grueling months however , have ensured that people across the world have realized the potential and importance of innovation for a sustainable growth .
The following chart acknowledges the fact that there has been a credible increase in the amount of interest shown in innovation during the worst 2 years ( 2008 - 09 ) in recent times .
Incidentally , the last 2 - 3 years have also been the time when social scientists and policy - makers world - over have noticed a valuable Indian contribution to innovation and indeed have taken a serious note of that .
The Indian contribution has been more on the lines of “ low - cost innovation ” punctuated by the idea of M4L4 M , more famously termed as Jugaad , and is seen as the latest export to the developed world .
Although the use of the term Jugaad remains controversial ( the word originates in Hindi and has a negative connotation ) , it has become synonymous with low - cost innovation .
As we can see from the graph below , across the world , the reference to the term “ Jugaad ” has been a very recent phenomenon and has had a major influence emanating from India .
The primary focus today is about organizations adopting the low - cost innovative ideas from India .
However , I feel this new concept of Jugaad or low - cost innovation should be handled deftly and should n’t be seen as a blind man ’s navigation device .
The innovations arising out of the Indian heartland , although being very - very low cost ideas , are many a times the result of a necessity and thus are purely a matter of chance .
Hence , while organizations today are ready to adopt ‘ Jugaad ’ , there are two more things that they should be ready to adopt : learning from low – cost inventions in India at one end and on the other high - cost inventions from the west .
Accordingly , what needs to be done by the organizations is not only to be prepared to replicate the successful innovative business models but also to have teams which have an eye for inventions from India .
It becomes imperative to trap the local inventions ( most of such inventive ideas from India / emerging economies do n’t have a large outreach as they only fit the local bill ) and tweak them to ensure a more global outreach .
This would need organizations and policy makers to be ‘ INNOVENTIVE ’ rather than being simply ‘ Innovative ’ or ‘ Inventive ’ .
As said earlier , being absolutely driven by low - cost solutions for people and having low - cost innovation business models would be a perfunctory approach .
Business and policy makers should appreciate the necessity to also invest significantly in research to have the High - cost innovations .
Although the probability of the realization of potential from high - cost business models is as good as the low - cost ones , the former model has the capacity to change the world in case of a success and examples in this area shall be : the emergence of Google or the stable of Apple products .
These two organizations invest heavily to create a new market place for themselves , without compromising on their sustainability because of increasing costs .
A prime example of an organization in India which has adopted the three measures of ‘ low - cost innovation ’ , ‘ low - cost invention ’ and ‘ high - cost invention ’ , all under a single roof is the House of the Tata’s .
Their ‘ low - cost innovation ’ comes in the shape of Tata Nano where they innovated the existing delivery model to produce the cheapest family car in the world .
Their ‘ low - cost invention ’ comes as ‘ Tata - Swach ’ – a water purifier at less than $ 20 – where they invented a new technology and used naturally available resources to purify water .
And finally , their ‘ high - end inventions ’ come from their foreign acquisitions of Jaguar - Land Rover and Corus .

1991 Was Awesome
I wish I had n't been only seven years old in 1991 , cause this seems like a scene I could have really gotten into .
' Microrings ' could nix wires for communications in homes , offices
The wireless house of the future might use a system being developed at Purdue University that could eliminate wires for communications in homes , businesses and cars .
The researchers designed and built a miniature device capable of converting ultra fast laser pulses into bursts of radio - frequency signals using innovative " microring resonators . "
Such an advance could enable all communications , from high - definition television broadcasts to secure computer connections , to be transmitted from a single base station .

WEST LAFAYETTE , Ind. — Purdue University researchers have developed a miniature device capable of converting ultrafast laser pulses into bursts of radio - frequency signals , a step toward making wires obsolete for communications in the homes and offices of the future .
Such an advance could enable all communications , from high - definition television broadcasts to secure computer connections , to be transmitted from a single base station , said Minghao Qi , an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering .
" Of course , ideas about specific uses of our technology are futuristic and speculative , but we envision a single base station and everything else would be wireless , " he said .
" This base station would be sort of a computer by itself , perhaps a card inserted into one of the expansion slots in a central computer .
The central computer would take charge of all the information processing , a single point of contact that interacts with the external world in receiving and sending information . "
Ordinarily , the continuous waves of conventional radio - frequency transmissions encounter interference from stray signals reflecting off of the walls and objects inside a house or office .
However , the pulsing nature of the signals produced by the new " chip - based spectral shaper " reduces the interference that normally plagues radio frequency communications , said Andrew Weiner , Purdue 's Scifres Family Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering .
This diagram shows the design for new silicon " microring resonators , " miniature devices used in a system that converts ultra fast laser pulses into bursts of radio - frequency signals .
The innovation is a step toward making wires obsolete for communications in homes and offices .
Such an advance could enable all communications , from high - definition television broadcasts to secure computer connections , to be transmitted from a single base station .
The microring filter can be tuned by heating the rings .
( Purdue University , Minghao Qi ) Download image
Each laser pulse lasts about 100 femtoseconds , or one - tenth of a trillionth of a second .
These pulses are processed using " optical arbitrary waveform technology " pioneered by Purdue researchers led by Weiner .
Findings have appeared online in the journal Nature Photonics and were published in the February print issue of the magazine .
The research is based at Purdue 's Birck Nanotechnology Center in the university 's Discovery Park .
" What enables this technology is that our devices generate ultrabroad bandwidth radio frequencies needed to transmit the high data rates required for high resolution displays , " Weiner said .
Such a technology might eventually be developed to both receive and transmit signals .
" But initially , industry will commercialize devices that only receive signals , for ' one - way ' traffic , such as television sets , projectors , monitors and printers , " Qi said .
" This is because the sending unit for transmitting data is currently still a little bulky .
Later , if the sending unit can be integrated into the devices , we could enjoy full two - way traffic , enabling the wireless operation of things like hard - disc drives and computers . "
The approach also might be used for transmitting wireless signals inside cars .
The researchers first create laser pulses with specific " shapes " that characterize the changing intensity of light from the beginning to end of each pulse .
The pulses are then converted into radio frequency signals .
A key factor making the advance potentially useful is that the pulses transmit radio frequencies of up to 60 gigahertz , a frequency included in the window of the radio spectrum not reserved for military communications .
The Federal Communications Commission does not require a license to transmit signals from 57 - 64 gigahertz .
This unlicensed band also is permitted globally , meaning systems using 60 gigahertz could be compatible worldwide .
" There is only a very limited window for civil operations , and 60 gigahertz falls within this window , " Qi said .
Ordinary computer chips have difficulty transmitting electronic signals at such a rapid frequency because of " timing jitter , " or the uneven timing with which transistors open and close to process information .
This uneven " clock " timing , or synchronization , of transistors does not hinder ordinary computer chips , which have a speed of about 3 gigahertz .
However , for devices switching on and off at 60 gigahertz , this jitter prevents proper signal processing .
Another complication is that the digital - to - analog converters needed to convert pulsing laser light into radio frequency signals will not work at such high frequencies .
To sidestep these limitations , researchers have previously created " bulk optics " systems , which use mirrors , lenses and other optical components arranged on a vibration - dampened table several feet long to convert and transmit the pulsed signals .
However , these systems are far too large to be practical .
Now , the Purdue researchers have miniaturized the technology small enough to fit on a computer chip .
" We shrank the size of the bulk optical setup by thousands of times , " Qi said .
The system is programmable so that it could be instructed to produce and transmit only certain frequencies , he said .
The researchers fabricated tiny silicon " microring resonators , " devices that filter out certain frequencies and allow others to pass .
A series of the microrings were combined in a programmable " spectral shaper " 100 microns wide , or about the width of a human hair .
Each of the microrings is about 10 microns in diameter .
The microring filter can be tuned by heating the rings , which causes them to change so that they filter different frequencies .
The research is funded by the National Science Foundation , the Defense Threat Reduction Agency , and the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship program from the Office of the Secretary of Defense .
Purdue filed a provisional patent in January for the technology , which is at least five years away from being ready for commercialization , Qi said .
The Nature Photonics paper was written by physics doctoral student Maroof H. Khan , electrical and computer engineering doctoral students Hao Shen and Lin Zhao , postdoctoral researchers Yi Xuan and Shijun Xiao , senior research scientist Daniel E. Leaird , Weiner and Qi .

Detroit firefighters discuss impact of utility shut - offs and budget cuts
By Jerry White
17 March 2010
On March 12 Detroit firefighters held a dinner for Sylvia Young , a 30 - year - old mother who lost three small children in a house fire on the city ’s west side .
The March 2 fire started just hours after the local utility provider , DTE Energy , cut off gas and electrical service to the home on Bangor Street .
The dinner , hosted by the Phoenix organization , a group of African American firefighters , was held at Engine Co. # 40 fire station .
As Sylvia Young , her surviving children and other family members entered the station , firefighters stood at attention .
The family was welcomed by Phoenix President James C. Harris who told them , “ our house is your house ” and that firefighters would always be there if Sylvia needed help .
The following day more than 30 firefighters attended the funeral for Trávion , 5 , Fantasia , 4 , and Selena , 3 , and several acted as pallbearers .
( See “ Funeral held for Detroit children killed in Bangor Street fire ” ) .
The warmth and solidarity of the firefighters stands in sharp contrast to the vindictive treatment Sylvia Young has received from the news media , government officials and DTE Energy , which have repeatedly maligned her .
The state attorney ’s office is threatening to take away her remaining children because she was not at home when the fire started .
In fact she was at a discount store buying space heaters and returned with them in hand to see her house engulfed in flames .
The deep sympathy the firefighters have for Young and other Detroit residents stems from their first - hand experience with the consequences of utility shut - offs and poverty in the city .
In addition to endangering the lives of ordinary citizens , DTE ’s utility shut - offs also put the lives of firefighters at risk .
Moreover , Detroit firefighters , like the rest of city residents , have been hit by decades of budget cuts and layoffs , exacerbating the dangers they face every day .
Several firefighters noted that the dinner was being held on the anniversary of the worst disaster for the Detroit Fire Department in its history , the loss of three firefighters during a March 12 , 1987 blaze at an abandoned warehouse and nearby paper factory .
At that time , city officials tried to blame a homeless man — who was trying to keep warm in the abandoned factory — in order to divert attention from the fact that city officials had slashed funding for the fire department and closed the nearest fire station .
The firefighters at Engine Co. # 40 have responded to several fires in the city where the victims had no utility service .
They told the WSWS that fighting fires in a city where residents lack the most basic necessities of modern life — and where the firefighters are short - handed and understaffed — exacts a heavy physical and psychological toll on firefighters .
A firefighter with 15 years experience related the story of one comrade , Jackie “ Rage ” Jones .
As a young , inexperienced firefighter , the first blaze he responded to was the February 1993 fire on Mack Ave .
where seven small children were killed .
The experience — including holding four of the dying children in his arms — had so traumatized him that he was never the same again .
Years later Jones took his own life by jumping off the Belle Isle Bridge .
The tragic fire was the direct result of the cut - off of water , gas and electrical service to the home .
( See “ The 1993 Mack Ave. fire inquiry ” )
Over the last two decades , the city ’s Democratic mayors have eliminated hundreds of firefighters ’ jobs , shut down stations and reduced funding for the purchase of new equipment and the repair of decaying stations and emergency vehicles .
Another firefighter said the Fire Department ’s computers were outdated and there were six Emergency Medical Service ( EMS ) vehicles that were not properly licensed to carry trained technicians because the city would not spend $ 390 to buy the licenses .
Many skilled EMS technicians were therefore leaving the fire department to get jobs with local hospitals .
In recent years , the city administration has closed several stations and at least four others have been “ deactivated , ” the closing down of stations for days at a time when the department cannot find available manpower .
The World Socialist Web Site spoke with Sgt. Mike Funchess , an officer from Engine Co. # 40 .
“ We are required to respond with seven pieces of equipment to each fire , ” Funchess said .
“ But if there are two fires at once in an area and other companies are called in to help it shrinks the available manpower .
We get over - stretched and have to figure out where to send our resources first because closed companies have no one to send .
I ’m afraid this is going to go on until someone is killed .
Then the day after it happens they will announce they are putting firefighters on overtime .
“ We are fighting fires in poor neighborhoods .
I ’d say 65 percent of the fires in homes we are told are vacant really have homeless people squatting in them .
These people do n’t want anyone to know they are there .
They burn wood in the fireplace to stay warm and put plastic over the windows .
You would swear the houses were vacant but people are living there .
“ We ’re supposed to let the vacant homes burn down but I say let ’s put it out .
Sometimes you hear a dog barking inside and know someone must have tied him up in there .
It ’s not my job to let it burn up .
“ I think a lot of the fires in the city are not in downtrodden areas but areas where real estate developers want to build a new row of houses .
“ The mayor is talking about shutting down whole areas of the city and privatizing services .
He wo n’t let us hire .
In 1989 , when I hired in , there were 2,100 firefighters .
There are 800 now .
“ We need to hire and bring in new firefighters who are 23 to 25 years old because this is a physically demanding job .
The last fireman who was hired — five years ago — was 42 , and had been laid off from another city job .
“ A lot of young people around the city want jobs .
They could learn to fight fires and that would strengthen us .
But the city is n’t hiring .
Instead , guys are getting hurt and beat up .
They ’ve cut us bad .
One guy is doing the job of four and they wear out faster . ”
Fifteen people , including two journalists , were detained by Israeli troops and police officers when the police attacked a Palm Sunday protest near Bethlehem .
Palestinians , along with international and Israeli supporters , gathered at the Church on Nativity in Bethlehem city , southern West Bank , and caried Palm leaves and flags , and headed towards the gate of the Annexation Wall separating Bethlehem form Jerusalem city .
The protesters demanded their right of warship .
Israeli only allowed a limited number of Christian Palestinians to reach Jerusalem for the Easter week starting this Sunday .
At the gate of the wall , protesters marched forward and managed to pass the military checkpoint and entered Jerusalem .
After crossing the roadblock , troops and police officers attacked the protesters and detained fifteen among them a Palestinian and an Israeli journalist .
Abbas Zakki , a seniour official of Fateh movement , was among those detained .
In total three Israeli activists and one American were also detained by the Israeli military .
Later on , soldiers forced people back to the wall and detained all the protesters and journalists between the wall and the gate of the wall until the soldiers opened the gate of the wall and allowed people back into Bethlehem city .
Troops used batons and rifle - butts to bush people through the gate .
People For the American
Way calls on group to reject remarks
In response to the launch of the Carrie Prejean ad campaign against marriage equality , People For the American Way president Michael Keegan issued the following statement :
“ If the National Organization for Marriage wants to make the comments of a gossip columnist and a beauty queen the subject of a national debate , then it should answer for the bizarre and troubling remarks of its most prominent board member — best - selling science fiction writer Orson Scott Card .
“ The NOM has argued that it is not a homophobic organization , but Card ’s remarks suggest otherwise .
Card , who represents the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints on the board and received an effusive welcome last week from NOM president Maggie Gallagher , supports criminalizing sex between same - sex adults :
Laws against homosexual behavior should remain on the books … to be used when necessary to send a clear message that those who flagrantly violate society ’s regulation of sexual behavior cannot be permitted to remain as acceptable , equal citizens .
“ Card has also advocated overthrowing the government if same - sex marriage is permitted :
How long before married people answer the dictators thus : Regardless of law , marriage has only one definition , and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy .
I will act to destroy that government and bring it down , so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage , and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn .
Biological imperatives trump laws .
American government cannot fight against marriage and hope to endure .
If the Constitution is defined in such a way as to destroy the privileged position of marriage , it is that insane Constitution , not marriage , that will die .
“ It is one thing for a science fiction writer to have such views , but it ’s something much different for a national organization like the NOM to endorse those views by giving Card such a prominent position on its board .
We call on the NOM to categorically reject Card ’s radical statements . ”

As you may have already heard in the sermon from March 27 – 28 , the elders graciously approved on March 22 a leave of absence that will take me away from Bethlehem from May 1 through December 31 , 2010 .
We thought it might be helpful to put an explanation in a letter to go along with the sermon .
I asked the elders to consider this leave because of a growing sense that my soul , my marriage , my family , and my ministry - pattern need a reality check from the Holy Spirit .
On the one hand , I love my Lord , my wife , my five children and their families first and foremost ; and I love my work of preaching and writing and leading Bethlehem .
I hope the Lord gives me at least five more years as the pastor for preaching and vision at Bethlehem .
But on the other hand , I see several species of pride in my soul that , while they may not rise to the level of disqualifying me for ministry , grieve me , and have taken a toll on my relationship with Noël and others who are dear to me .
How do I apologize to you , not for a specific deed , but for ongoing character flaws , and their effects on everybody ?
I ’ll say it now , and no doubt will say it again , I ’m sorry .
Since I do n’t have just one deed to point to , I simply ask for a spirit of forgiveness ; and I give you as much assurance as I can that I am not making peace , but war , with my own sins .
Noël and I are rock solid in our commitment to each other , and there is no whiff of unfaithfulness on either side .
But , as I told the elders , “ rock solid ” is not always an emotionally satisfying metaphor , especially to a woman .
A rock is not the best image of a woman ’s tender companion .
In other words , the precious garden of my home needs tending .
I want to say to Noël that she is precious to me in a way that , at this point in our 41 - year pilgrimage , can be said best by stepping back for a season from virtually all public commitments .
No marriage is an island .
For us this is true in two senses .
One is that Noël and I are known inside - out by a few friends at Bethlehem — most closely by our long - time colleagues and friends David and Karin Livingston , and then by a cluster of trusted women with Noël and men with me .
We are accountable , known , counseled , and prayed for .
I am deeply thankful for a gracious culture of transparency and trust among the leadership at Bethlehem .
The other way that our marriage is not an island is that its strengths and defects have consequences for others .
No one in the orbit of our family and friends remains unaffected by our flaws .
My prayer is that this leave will prove to be healing from the inside of my soul , through Noël ’s heart , and out to our children and their families , and beyond to anyone who may have been hurt by my failures .
The difference between this leave and the sabbatical I took four years ago is that I wrote a book on that sabbatical ( What Jesus Demands from the World ) .
In 30 years , I have never let go of the passion for public productivity .
In this leave , I intend to let go of all of it .
No book - writing .
No sermon preparation or preaching .
No blogging .
No Twitter .
No articles .
No reports .
No papers .
And no speaking engagements .
There is one stateside exception — the weekend devoted to the Desiring God National Conference combined with the inaugural convocation of Bethlehem College and Seminary in October .
Noël thought I should keep three international commitments .
Our reasoning is that if she could go along , and if we plan it right , these could be very special times of refreshment together .
The elders have appointed a group to stay in touch and keep me accountable for this leave .
They are David Mathis , Jon Bloom , Tom Steller , Sam Crabtree , Jon Grano , Tim Held , Tony Campagna , and Kurt Elting - Ballard .
Five of these have walked with Noël and me over the last two months , helping us discern the wisdom , scope , and nature of this leave .
They brought the final recommendation to the elders on March 22 .
I asked the elders not to pay me for this leave .
I do n’t feel it is owed to me .
I know I am causing more work for others , and I apologize to the staff for that .
Not only that , others could use similar time away .
Most working men and women do not have the freedom to step back like this .
The elders did not agree with my request .
Noël and I are profoundly grateful for this kind of affection .
We will seek the Lord for how much of your financial support to give back to the church , to perhaps bear some of the load .
Personally , I view these months as a kind of relaunch of what I hope will be the most humble , happy , fruitful five years of our 35 years at Bethlehem and 46 years of marriage .
Would you pray with me to that end ?
And would you stand by your church with all your might ?
May
God make these eight months the best Bethlehem has ever known .
It would be just like God to do the greatest things when I am not there .
“ Neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything , but only God who gives the growth ” ( 1 Corinthians 3:7 ) .
I love you and promise to pray for you every day .

Facts On the Ground
After bowing to right - wing pressure , Israel 's naming to their National Heritage list of two highly contested West Bank shrines – Rachel 's Tomb in Bethlehem and Hebron 's Tomb of the Patriarchs – has sparked Palestinian and international protests .
We wonder : Does Israel do these things to intentionally spark , or in blithe disregard for , the outrage they must know will follow ?
" We strongly condemn this decision which yet again confirms the Israeli government 's determination to impose facts on the ground , " said chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat .

Would society really collapse if Americans stopped trusting government wholesale , or would only the corrupt in power be threatened ?
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , March 19 , 2010
Considering the number of times governments have been caught lying over the last few decades , we have to ask the question , should the belief that major world events and political developments happen as a result of a conspiracy of some form or other be the default position in contemporary thinking , or should we continue to blindly trust government and afford it the credibility it plainly does n’t deserve in order to maintain a perceived sense of order ?
Knowing their track record , trusting governments has become the height of foolishness .
It would be like betting your mortgage on a horse that has lost every race it ever ran to win the Kentucky Derby .
And yet under the Obama administration , Americans are not only being told to trust government but to serve government , a complete reversal of the role of the state as laid down by the founders .
Would society really collapse if the vast majority of Americans distrusted government and authority figures as a reflex response , or would such a prevalent attitude lead to the most rapid restoration of freedom ever witnessed ?
With corruption and injustice so virulently entwined in just about every sector of the federal government , a vacuum of power would inevitably ensue , leading potentially to a temporary state of anarchy .
However , the common need for limited government would create fertile soil for the organic growth of more representative bodies .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The only way for the conspiratorial view of history to be dislodged from the prominent position in the body politic it has come to occupy would be for governments to start telling the truth again and stop lying to the public on an almost habitual basis .
This is why reflex distrust of government is inherently healthy for a free and prosperous society .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
However , since this is far too inconvenient for them , the establishment has decided instead to make their propaganda more sophisticated and more believable , in the hope that the public will grow tired of asking questions and reluctantly accept a contrived substitute for reality .
The establishment ’s war on “ conspiracy theories , ” illustrated by White House regulatory czar Cass Sunstein ’s attempt to ban or tax them , is almost completely focused around creating a misconception of why conspiracy theories attract prominence , advocacy , and credibility .
They do so not as a result of some mass mental illness on behalf of the population , but as a natural reaction to endless government corruption , cover-ups and misdeeds .
The increasing conspicuity of the conspiratorial view of history is merely a symptom of growing distrust in government .
Widespread distrust in government does not pose a threat to the public nor to their freedoms , it only poses a threat to tyrants and monopoly men who want to maintain their oppressive power over others .
Distrust in government is not extremist , unstable or psychotic as the military - industrial complex owned media would have it , it ’s necessary , healthy and the most patriotic expression of freedom imaginable .
America was founded on distrust of government , and so long as that remains the case the fires of liberty will burn bright , even in times of mass deception and authoritarian brainwashing .

Europe Will Exceed 2020 Renewable Energy Target
February 28th , 2010 by Zachary Shahan
A new analysis by the European Wind Energy Association finds that the European Union ( EU ) is going to exceed its target of producing 20 % of its energy from renewable energy sources by 2020 .
The reports looked at all forms of renewable energy .
It found that 13 of the 27 EU countries are set to meet their target , 8 are set to exceed it and the remaining 6 are expected to fall short .
[ social_buttons ]
Bulgaria , Belgium , Denmark , Italy , Luxembourg and Malta are reportedly not on track to meet their targets , but none of them are expected to be more than 1 % below their target .
Larger countries leading the pack , “ Spain and Germany are set to top the European league tables for renewable energy , with the Spanish government announcing it is on track to generate 22.7 per cent of its power from renewables by 2020 , which is almost three percentage points above its 20 per cent target . ”
Estonia , Greece , Ireland , Poland , Slovakia and Sweden are the other countries expected to exceed their individual targets .
Christine Lins , secretary general of the European Renewable Energy Council says : “ The clear majority of European Member States recognise the economic , environmental and social benefits of promoting a broad range of renewable energy technologies nationally , as reflected in their forecast documents . ”
All EU countries are required to submit a National Action Plan to the European Commission with details as to how they plan to meet their individual targets by June 2010 , under the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive .
Justin Wilkes , policy director of EWEA , focuses on the change in attitude and forecast since the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive was adopted in 2008 , saying : “ Europe has witnessed a sea- change since the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive was agreed as in 2008 many countries were stating that their target would be difficult to meet – now the majority are forecasting that they will meet or exceed their national target . ”
Hopefully the US can at least set a renewable energy target soon .

The Tokyo Fire Raids , 1945
The Japanese View
Printer Friendly Version >>>
The B - 29 Superfortress bomber made its first appearance over Tokyo on November 1 , 1944 - a single plane flying at 35,000 feet ; beyond the reach of the defender 's anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes .
The intruder dropped no bombs .
This was strictly a reconnaissance mission .
The Superforts returned in force at the end of the month , flying at altitudes that insured immunity from attacks by Japanese defenders .
Although their high altitude provided a shield for the bombers , it also decreased the accuracy and impact of their bomb runs .
To correct this deficiency , Major - General Curtis Lemay ( newly appointed commander of the American Bomber Command ) ordered a dramatic change in tactics .
The bomber runs would be made at night , at low altitude and deliver a mixture of high explosive and incendiary bombs .
The objective was to turn the closely - packed , wooden homes and buildings prevalent in the Japanese cities into raging infernos and ultimately into the most destructive of all weapons - the firestorm .
The Allies had first encountered the phenomenon of the firestorm when the British bombed the German city of Hamburg in August of 1943 .
The night raid ignited numerous fires that soon united into one uncontrollable mass of flame , so hot it generated its own self - sustaining , gale - force winds and literally sucked the oxygen out of the air , suffocating its victims .
Lemay hoped to use this force to level the cities of Japan .
Tokyo would be the first test .
A successful incendiary raid required ideal weather that included dry air and significant wind .
Weather reports predicted these conditions over Tokyo on the night of March 9 - 10 , 1945 .
A force of 334 B - 29s was unleashed - each plane stripped of ammunition for its machine guns to allow it to carry more fire - bombs .
The lead attackers arrived over the city just after dark and were followed by a procession of death that lasted until dawn .
The fires started by the initial raiders could be seen from 150 miles away .
The results were devastating : almost 17 square miles of the city were reduced to ashes .
Estimates of the number killed range between 80,000 and 200,000 , a higher death toll than that produced by the dropping of the Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima or Nagasaki six months later .
" They set to work at once sowing the sky with fire . "
Robert Guillain was a French reporter assigned to Japan in 1938 .
He stayed on after war broke in Europe and was trapped in the country after Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor .
He returned to France in 1946 and published a book recounting his experiences .
He was in Tokyo on the night of March 9 , 1945 when the wet winter weather made a surprise change to mild temperatures and gusty winds .
We join his story as the sound of air - raid sirens pierce the night and the first B - 29s make their appearance : " They set to work at once sowing the sky with fire .
Bursts of light flashed everywhere in the darkness like Christmas trees lifting their decorations of flame high into the night , then fell back to earth in whistling bouquets of jagged flame .
Barely a quarter of an hour after the raid started , the fire , whipped by the wind , began to scythe its way through the density of that wooden city .
ADVERTISMENT
This time again , luck - or rather , the American command 's methodical planning - spared my district from direct attack .
A huge borealis grew over the quarters closer to the center , which had obviously been reached by the gradual , raid - by - raid unrolling of the carpet - bombing .
The bright light dispelled the night and B - 29s were visible here and there in the sky .
For the first time , they flew low or middling high in staggered levels .
Their long , glinting wings , sharp as blades , could be seen through the oblique columns of smoke rising from the city , suddenly reflecting the fire from the furnace below , black silhouettes gliding through the fiery sky to reappear farther on , shining golden against the dark roof of heaven or glittering blue , like meteors , in the searchlight beams spraying the vault from horizon to horizon .
There was no question in such a raid of huddling blindly underground ; you could be roasted alive before you knew what was happening .
All the Japanese in the gardens near mine were out of doors or peering up out of their holes , uttering cries of admiration - this was typically Japanese - at this grandiose , almost theatrical spectacle .
The bombs were falling farther off now , beyond the hill that closed my horizon .
But the wind , still violent , began to sweep up the burning debris beaten down from the inflamed sky .
The air was filled with live sparks , then with burning bits of wood and paper until soon it was raining fire .
One had to race constantly from terrace to garden and around the house to watch for fires and douse firebrands .
Far - off torch clusters exploded and fell back in wavy lines on the city .
Sometimes , probably when inflammable liquids were set alight , the bomb blasts looked like flaming hair .
Here and there , the red puffs of antiaircraft bursts sent dotted red lines across the sky , but the defenses were ineffectual and the big B - 29s , flying in loose formation , seemed to work unhampered .
At intervals the sky would empty ; the planes disappeared .
But fresh waves , announced in advance by the hoarse but still confident radio voice , soon came to occupy the night and the frightful Pentecost resumed .
Flames rose nearby - it was difficult to tell how near - toward the hill where my district ended .
I could see them twisting in the wind across roofs silhouetted in black ; dark debris whirled in the storm above me . "
" Hell could be no hotter . "
The bombers ' primary target was the neighboring industrial district of the city that housed factories , docks and the homes of the workers who supplied the manpower for Japan 's war industry .
The district hugged Tokyo Bay and was densely - packed with wooden homes lining winding streets that followed random paths - all the ingredients necessary for creating a perfect fire storm .
" Around midnight , the first Superfortresses dropped hundreds of clusters of the incendiary cylinders the people called " Molotov flower baskets , " marking out the target zone with four or five big fires .
The planes that followed , flying lower , circled and crisscrossed the area , leaving great rings of fire behind them .
Soon other waves came in to drop their incendiaries inside the " marker " circles .
Hell could be no hotter .
The inhabitants stayed heroically put as the bombs dropped , faithfully obeying the order that each family defend its own home .
But how could they fight the fires with that wind blowing and when a single house might be hit by ten or even more of the bombs , each weighing up to 6.6 pounds , that were raining down by the thousands ?
As they fell , cylinders scattered a kind of flaming dew that skittered along the roofs , setting fire to everything it splashed and spreading a wash of dancing flames everywhere - the first version of napalm , of dismal fame .
The meager defenses of those thousands of amateur firemen - feeble jets of hand - pumped water , wet mats and sand to be thrown on the bombs when one could get close enough to their terrible heat were completely inadequate .
Roofs collapsed under the bombs ' impact and within minutes the frail houses of wood and paper were aflame , lighted from the inside like paper lanterns .
The hurricane - force wind puffed up great clots of flame and sent burning planks planing through the air to fell people and set fire to what they touched .
Flames from a distant cluster of houses would suddenly spring up close at hand , traveling at the speed of a forest fire .
Then screaming families abandoned their homes ; sometimes the women had already left , carrying their babies and dragging crates or mattresses .
Too late : the circle of fire had closed off their street .
Sooner or later , everyone was surrounded by fire .
The police were there and so were detachments of helpless firemen who for a while tried to control the fleeing crowds , channeling them toward blackened holes where earlier fires had sometimes carved a passage .
In the rare places where the fire hoses worked - water was short and the pressure was low in most of the mains - firemen drenched the racing crowds so that they could get through the barriers of flame .
Elsewhere , people soaked themselves in the water barrels that stood in front of each house before setting off again .
A litter of obstacles blocked their way ; telegraph poles and the overhead trolley wires that formed a dense net around Tokyo fell in tangles across streets .
In the dense smoke , where the wind was so hot it seared the lungs , people struggled , then burst into flames where they stood .
The fiery air was blown down toward the ground and it was often the refugees ' feet that began burning first : the men's puttees and the women 's trousers caught fire and ignited the rest of their clothing .
Proper air - raid clothing as recommended by the government to the civilian population consisted of a heavily padded hood over the head and shoulders that was supposed chiefly to protect people 's ears from bomb blasts - explosives , that is .
But for months , Tokyo had mostly been fire - bombed .
The hoods flamed under the rain of sparks ; people who did not burn from the feet up burned from the head down .
Mothers who carried their babies strapped to their backs , Japanese style , would discover too late that the padding that enveloped the infant had caught fire .
Refugees clutching their packages crowded into the rare clear spaces - crossroads , gardens and parks - but the bundles caught fire even faster than clothing and the throng flamed from the inside .
Hundreds of people gave up trying to escape and , with or without their precious bundles , crawled into the holes that served as shelters ; their charred bodies were found after the raid .
Whole families perished in holes they had dug under their wooden houses because shelter space was scarce in those overpopulated hives of the poor ; the house would collapse and burn on top of them , braising them in their holes .
The fire front advanced so rapidly that police often did not have time to evacuate threatened blocks even if a way out were open .
And the wind , carrying debris from far away , planted new sprouts of fire in unexpected places .
Firemen from the other half of the city tried to move into the inferno or to contain it within its own periphery , but they could not approach it except by going around it into the wind , where their efforts were useless or where everything had already been incinerated .
The same thing happened that had terrorized the city during the great fire of 1923 : ... under the wind and the gigantic breath of the fire , immense , incandescent vortices rose in a number of places , swirling , flattening sucking whole blocks of houses into their maelstrom of fire .
Wherever there was a canal , people hurled themselves into the water ; in shallow places , people waited , half sunk in noxious muck , mouths just above the surface of the water .
Hundreds of them were later found dead ; not drowned , but asphyxiated by the burning air and smoke .
In other places , the water got so hot that the luckless bathers were simply boiled alive .
Some of the canals ran directly into the Sumida ; when the tide rose , people huddled in them drowned .
In Asakusa and Honjo , people crowded onto the bridges , but the spans were made of steel that gradually heated ; human clusters clinging to the white - hot railings finally let go , fell into the water and were carried off on the current .
Thousands jammed the parks and gardens that lined both banks of the Sumida .
As panic brought ever fresh waves of people pressing into the narrow strips of land , those in front were pushed irresistibly toward the river ; whole walls of screaming humanity toppled over and disappeared in the deep water .
Thousands of drowned bodies were later recovered from the Sumida estuary .
Sirens sounded the all - clear around 5 A.M. - those still working in the half of the city that had not been attacked ; the other half burned for twelve hours more .
I talked to someone who had inspected the scene an March 11 .
What was most awful , my witness told me , was having to get off his bicycle every couple of feet to pass over the countless bodies strewn through the streets .
There was still a light wind blowing and some of the bodies , reduced to ashes , were simply scattering like sand .
In many sectors , passage was blocked by whole incinerated crowds . "

Fifty years after the invention of the optical laser , two separate research groups have independently made important steps toward making phonon lasers - a type of laser that emits very high - frequency , coordinated sound rather than light waves - a reality .
The studies , published in the current issue of the journal Physical Review Letters , could lead to a completely new kind of laser that could find interesting applications in medical imaging .
The quantum nature of light means its ' possible to emit coherent photons of the same frequency and phase , in a process called " stimulated emission " .
This was predicted in 1917 by Albert Einstein and first put into practice in 1960 , when the first optical laser was built .
Despite some fundamental differences , light and sound waves are both formed by quanta , meaning that sound lasers ( or " sasers " ) are also possible .
Researchers have been looking at sound lasers for some time , but have n't been able to build one working at very high ( terahertz ) frequencies just yet .
The interest around sound lasers is not just purely academic : sound propagates at a speed that is about 100,000 smaller than the speed of light , and therefore has a proportionately smaller wavelength , along with lower energy levels .
The combination of these two factors means sound lasers would allow for extremely precise imaging of living tissue without damaging it in the process ( as is often the case with optical imaging ) .
The main obstacle to the implementation of a high - frequency saser is also what makes it so attractive : the shorter wavelengths make it harder to coordinate the quantum particles to travel coherently and realize the " stimulated emission " in phonons .
Two research teams from the US and the UK tackled the problem using different approaches , and both made important progress towards making sasers a reality .
A group from Caltech assembled a pair of microscopic cavities that only permit specific frequencies of phonons to be emitted , effectively producing a resonator that ensures the waves are always in phase with each other .
A second group from the University of Nottingham in the UK took a different approach : they built their device out of electrons moving through a series of structures known as " quantum wells " : whenever an electron hops from one quantum well to the next , it produces a phonon .
While this system does n't have the properties of a true phonon lasing , the system showed it amplifies high - frequency sound and could be used in the future as a fundamental building block of the first sound laser .
Both these studies are important breakthroughs that will one day bring to practical , high - frequency phonon lasers .
While it's hard to predict right away what repercussion this could have in the long run — the optical laser was deemed next to useless shortly after being invented — medical imaging would surely benefit greatly from its development even in the short term .

Many people believe the term " atheist " indicates someone who says " God does not exist " or " There is no God " .
This is not true .
This is a common misconception among theists , that the term " atheist " implies a person has a belief in the non-existence of God .
Let 's look at the source of the word :
" Atheism " , from the Greek :
atheismos : noun , from
: noun , from a - : lacking , without , or not having something ; akin to the English suffix " - less "
- : lacking , without , or not having something ; akin to the English suffix " - less " theos : a god , deity , mighty magic entity
: a god , deity , mighty magic entity - ismos : a state , quality , or condition ; an " - ism "
Therefore , " atheism " is " the state , quality , or condition of being without a god or deity " .
" Atheos " would literally mean " godless " , and " atheismos " ( " atheism " ) would literally mean " godlessness " .
Notice that the prefix " a - " does not mean " not " or " against " .
It 's a common mistake to think so .
That would require the use of the Greek prefix " anti - " , such as in the term antikhristos ( " antichrist " ) .
Now , let 's change that suffix .
" Atheist " , from the Greek :
atheistês : noun , from atheismos +
: noun , from atheismos + - istês : one who supports , subscribes to , or performs something
An " atheist " , then , would be " a person who supports or subscribes to a godless state , quality , or condition " .
This does not necessarily mean that atheists positively believe that there is no god .
It simply means that they advocate a lifestyle that is devoid of one .
They live their lives as if there were no god .
Common dictionary definitions of atheism
Many popular dictionaries imply the strong definition of atheism as the default , even though strong atheists ( people who claim there are no god(s ) ) are a minority among those calling themselves atheist .
One reason why a misleading definition of atheism exists in popular traditional publications can be traced back to the religious roots of those in the dictionary publishing business .
For example , Noah Webster :
Webster , founder of the dictionary company , was a devout Christian .
His speller was grounded in Scripture , and his first lesson began " Be not anxious for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor for your body , what ye shall put on ; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of these things . "
His 1828 American Dictionary contained the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume .
Webster considered education " useless without the Bible " .
Webster claimed to have learned 20 different languages in finding definitions for which a particular word is used .
From the preface to the 1828 edition of Webster 's American Dictionary of the English Language :
In my view , the Christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children , under a free government ought to be instructed ... .
No truth is more evident to my mind than that the Christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people .
Webster released his own edition of the Bible in 1833 , called the Common Version .
He used the King James Version ( KJV ) as a base and consulted the Hebrew and Greek along with various other versions and commentaries .
Webster molded the KJV to correct grammar , replaced words that were no longer used , and did away with words and phrases that could be seen as offensive .
All editions of Webster 's Dictionary published in 1913 and earlier , along with the Webster Bible and Dissertation on the English Language are available in the public domain .

SUBHEAD : Without ample , free - flowing petroleum , it will not be possible to support a population of several billion for long .
Humanity has struggled to survive through the millennia in terms of balancing population size with food supply .
The same is true now , but population numbers have been soaring for over a century .
The limiting factor has been hidden , but this factor -- oil and natural gas ( or petroleum ) -- is close to or beyond its peak extraction .
Without ample , free - flowing petroleum , it will not be possible to support a population of several billion for long .
Famine caused by petroleum supply failure alone will result in about 2.5 billion above - normal deaths before the year 2050 ; lost and averted births will amount to roughly an equal number .
In terms of its effects on daily human life , the most significant aspect of fossil - fuel depletion will be the lack of food .
“ Peak oil ” is basically “ peak food . ”
Modern agriculture is highly dependent on fossil fuels for fertilizers ( the Haber ‑Bosch process combines natural gas with atmospheric nitrogen to produce nitrogen fertilizer ) , pesticides , and the operation of machines for irrigation , harvesting , processing , and transportation .
Without fossil fuels , modern methods of food production will disappear , and crop yields will be far less than at present .
Crop yields are far lower in societies that do not have fossil fuels or modern machinery .
We should therefore have no illusions that several billion humans can be fed by “ organic gardening ” or anything else of that nature .
The Green Revolution involved , among other things , the development of higher - yielding crops .
These new varieties , however , could be grown only with large inputs of fertilizer and pesticides , all of which required fossil fuels .
In essence , the Green Revolution was little more than the invention of a way to turn petroleum into food .
Over the next few decades , therefore , there will be famine on a scale many times larger than ever before in human history .
It is possible , of course , that warfare and plague will take their toll to a large extent before famine claims its victims .
The distinctions , in any case , can never be absolute : often “ war + drought = famine ” [ 3 ] , especially in sub-Saharan Africa , but there are several other combinations of factors .
Although , when discussing theories of famine , economists generally use the term “ neo- malthusian ” in a derogatory manner , the coming famine will be very much a case of an imbalance between population and resources .
The overwhelming cause of the imbalance and famine will be fossil - fuel depletion , not government policy ( as in the days of Stalin or Mao ) , warfare , ethnic discrimination , bad weather , poor methods of distribution , inadequate transportation , livestock diseases , or any of the other variables that have often turned mere hunger into genuine starvation .
The increase in the world ’s population has followed a simple curve : from about 1.7 billion in 1900 to about 6.1 billion in 2000 .
A quick glance at a chart of world population growth , on a broader time scale , shows a line that runs almost horizontally for thousands of years , and then makes an almost vertical ascent as it approaches the present .
That is not just an amusing curiosity .
It is a shocking fact that should have awakened humanity to the realization that something is dreadfully wrong .
Mankind is always prey to its own “ exuberance , ” to use Catton ’s term [ 2 ] .
That has certainly been true of population growth .
In many cultures , “ Do you have any children ? ” or , “ How many children do you have ? ” is a form of greeting or civility almost equivalent to “ How do you do ? ” or , “ Nice to meet you . ”
World population growth , nevertheless , has always been ecologically hazardous .
The destruction of the environment reaches back into the invisible past , and the ruination of land , sea , and sky has been well described if not well heeded .
But what is even less frequently noted is that with every increase in human numbers we are only barely able to keep up with the demand : providing all those people with food and water has not been easy .
We are always pushing ourselves to the limits of Earth ’s ability to hold us .
Even that is an understatement .
No matter how much we depleted our resources , there was always the sense that we could somehow “ get by . ”
But in the late twentieth century we stopped getting by .
It is important to differentiate between production in an “ absolute ” sense and production “ per capita . ”
Although oil production , in “ absolute ” numbers , kept climbing — only to decline in the early twenty - first century — what was ignored was that although that “ absolute ” production was climbing , the production “ per capita ” reached its peak in 1979 [ 1 ] .
The unequal distribution of resources plays a part , of course .
The average inhabitant of the United States consumes far more than the average inhabitant of India or China .
Nevertheless , if all the world ’s resources were evenly distributed , the result would only be universal poverty .
It is the totals and the averages of resources that we must deal with in order to determine the totals and averages of results .
For example , if all of the world ’s arable land were distributed evenly , in the absence of mechanized agriculture each person on the planet would have an inadequate amount of farmland for survival : distribution would have accomplished very little .
We were always scraping the edges of the earth , but we are now entering a far more dangerous era .
The main point to keep in mind , however , is that throughout the twentieth century , oil production and human population were so closely integrated that every barrel of oil had an effect on human numbers .
While population has been going up , so has oil production .
Future excess mortality can therefore be determined ― at least in a rough - and - ready manner ― by the fact that in modern industrial society it is oil supply that determines how many people can be fed .
An increase in oil production leads to an increase in population , and a decrease in oil production leads to a decrease in population .
[ Jan Lundberg ’s note : this is why hopes for a technofix of renewable energy – almost always only for electricity -- is far off base regarding the huge present population ’s need to eat . ]
In round numbers , global oil production in the year 2008 was 30 billion barrels , and the population was 7 billion .
The consensus is that in the year 2050 oil production will be about 2 billion barrels .
The same amount of oil production occurred in the year 1930 , when the population was 2 billion .
The population in 2050 will therefore be about the same as in 1930 : 2 billion .
The difference between 7 billion people and 2 billion is 5 billion , which will therefore be the total number of famine deaths and lost or averted births for that period .
We can also determine the annual number of famine deaths and lost or averted births .
From 2008 to 2050 is 42 years .
The average annual difference in population is therefore 5 billion divided by 42 , which is about 120 million .
It is quite possible , however , that the decline in population will not exactly parallel the decline in oil .
In other words , the peak of the population curve may well be a few years later than the peak of the oil curve .
People might simply live with less oil per capita for a few decades , i.e. they will just sink further into poverty , with greater problems of malnutrition .
In fact , as long ago as 1972 , the first edition of The Limits to Growth in its Figure 35 , “ World Model Standard Run , ” showed a 40 - year gap between the peak production of food per capita and the peak of population [ 7 ] .
Many of those annual 120 million will not actually be deaths ; famine will cause a lowering of the birth rate .
This will sometimes happen voluntarily , as people realize they lack the resources to raise children , or it will happen involuntarily when famine and general ill health result in infertility [ 4 ] .
In most famines the number of deaths from starvation or from starvation - induced disease is very roughly the same as the number of lost or averted births [ 3 , 4 ] .
In Ireland ’s nineteenth - century famine , for example , the number of famine deaths was 1.3 million , whereas the number of lost births was 0.4 million .
The number of famine deaths during China ’s Great Leap Forward ( 1958 - 1961 ) was perhaps 30 million , and the number of lost births was perhaps 33 million .
The “ normal , ” non-famine - related , birth and death rates are not incorporated into the above future population figures , since for most of pre-industrial human history the sum of the two — i.e. the growth rate — has been nearly zero .
If not for the problem of resource - depletion , in other words , the future birth rate and death rate would be nearly identical , as they were in pre-industrial times .
And there is no question that the future will mean a return to the “ pre-industrial . ”
Nevertheless , it will often be hard to separate “ famine deaths ” from a rather broad category of “ other excess deaths . ”
War , disease , global warming , topsoil deterioration , and other factors will have unforeseeable effects of their own .
Considering the unusual duration of the coming famine , and with Leningrad [ 5 ] as one of many precursors , cannibalism may be significant ; to what extent should this be included in a calculation of “ famine deaths ” ?
It is probably safe to say , however , that an unusually large decline in the population of a country will be the most significant indicator that this predicted famine has in fact arrived .
These figures obliterate all previous estimates of future population growth .
Instead of a steady rise over the course of this century , as generally predicted , there will be a clash of the two giant forces of overpopulation and oil depletion , followed by a precipitous ride into the unknown future .
If the above figures are fairly accurate , we are ill - prepared for the next few years .
The problem of oil depletion turns out to be something other than a bit of macabre speculation for people of the distant future to deal with , but rather a sudden catastrophe that will only be studied dispassionately long after the event itself has occurred .
Doomsday will be upon us before we have time to look at it carefully .
The world has certainly known some terrible famines in the past , of course .
In recent centuries , one of the worst was that of North China in 1876 - 79 , when between 9 and 13 million died , but India had a famine at the same time , with perhaps 5 million deaths .
The Soviet Union had famine deaths of about 5 million in 1932 - 34 , purely because of political policies .
The worst famine in history was that of China ’s Great Leap Forward , 1958 - 61 , when perhaps 30 million died , as mentioned above .
A close analogy to “ petroleum famine ” may be Ireland ’s potato famine of the 1840s , since — like petroleum — it was a single commodity that caused such devastation [ 6 ] .
The response of the British government at the time can be summarized as a jumble of incompetence , frustration , and indecision , if not outright genocide .
“ There is such a tendency to exaggeration and inaccuracy in Irish reports that delay in acting on them is always desirable , ” wrote Sir Robert Peel in 1845 .
By 1847 the description had changed : “ Bodies half - eaten by rats were an ordinary sight ; ‘ two dogs were shot while tearing a body to pieces . ’ ”
The news of the coming famine might not be announced with sufficient clarity .
Famines tend to be back - page news nowadays , perhaps for the very reason that they are too common to be worth mentioning .
Although Ó Gráda speaks of “ making famine history ” [ 6 ] , the reality is that between 70 and 80 million people died of famine in the twentieth century , far more than in any previous century [ 4 ] .
The above predictions can be nothing more than approximate , of course , but even the most elaborate mathematics will not entirely help us to deal with the great number of interacting factors .
We need to swing toward a more pessimistic figure for humanity ’s future if we include the effects of war , disease , and so on .
The most serious negative factor will be largely sociological :
To what extent can the oil industry maintain the advanced technology required for drilling ever - deeper wells in ever - more - remote places , when that industry will be struggling to survive in a milieu of social chaos ?
Intricate division of labor , large - scale government , and high - level education will no longer exist .
On the other hand , there are elements of optimism that may need to be plugged in .
For one thing , there is what might be called the “ inertia factor ” : the planet Earth is so big that even the most catastrophic events take time for their ripples to finish spreading .
An asteroid fragment 10 kilometers wide hit eastern Mexico 65 million years ago , but enough of our distant ancestors survived that we ourselves are alive today to tell the story .
Somewhat related , among optimistic factors , is the sheer tenacity of the human species : we are intelligent social creatures living at the top of the food chain , in the manner of wolves , yet we outnumber wolves worldwide by about a million to one ; we are as populous as rats or mice .
We can outrace a horse over long distances .
Even with Stone - Age technology , we can inhabit almost every environment on Earth , even if most of the required survival skills have been forgotten .
Specifically , we must consider the fact that neither geography nor population is homogeneous .
All over the world , there are forgotten pockets of habitable land , much of it abandoned in the modern transition to urbanization , for the ironic reason that city dwellers regarded rural life as too difficult , as they traded their peasant smocks for factory overalls .
There are still areas of the planet ’s surface that are sparsely occupied although they are habitable or could be made so , to the extent that many rural areas have had a decline in population that is absolute , i.e. not merely relative to another place or time .
By careful calculation , therefore , there will be survivors .
Over the next few years , human ingenuity must be devoted to an understanding of these geographic and demographic matters , so that at least a few can escape the tribulation .
Neither the present nor future generations should have to say , “ We were never warned . ”

' Dr. Strangelove ' : Kubrick Film Presents Sellers in 3 Roles
By BOSLEY CROWTHER
tanley Kubrick 's new film , called " Dr. Strangelove or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb , " is beyond any question the most shattering sick joke I 've ever come across .
And I say that with full recollection of some of the grim ones I 've heard from Mort Sahl , some of the cartoons I 've seen by Charles Addams and some of the stuff I 've read in Mad Magazine .
For this brazenly jesting speculation of what might happen within the Pentagon and within the most responsible council of the President of the United States if some maniac Air Force general should suddenly order a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union is at the same time one of the cleverest and most incisive satiric thrusts at the awkwardness and folly of the military that have ever been on the screen .
It opened yesterday at the Victoria and the Baronet .
My reaction to it is quite divided , because there is so much about it that is grand , so much that is brilliant and amusing , and much that is grave and dangerous .
On the one hand , it cuts right to the soft pulp of the kind of military mind that is lost from all sense of reality in a maze of technical talk , and it shows up this type of mentality for the foolish and frightening thing it is .
In a top - level Air Force general , played by George C. Scott with a snarling and rasping volubility that makes your blood run cold , Mr. Kubrick presents us with a joker whose thinking is so involved with programs and cautions and suspicions that he is practically tied in knots .
It is he who is most completely baffled , bewildered and paralyzed when word comes through to Washington that a general in the Strategic Air Command has sent a wing of bombers off to drop bombs and that the planes cannot be recalled .
It is he who has to answer to the President for this awesome " accident " when the President gathers his council in the War Room at the Pentagon .
And it is he who looks the most unstable and dubious in the causes of peace when it begins to appear that the Russians have a retaliatory " doomsday device . "
Some of the conversations in that War Room are hilarious , shooting bright shafts of satire through mounds of ineptitude .
There is , best of all , a conversation between the President and an unseen Soviet Premier at the other end of a telephone line that is a titanic garble of nuttiness and platitudes .
Funny , too , in a mad way , is the behavior of the crew in one of the planes of the airborne alert force ordered to drop the bomb .
The commander is a Texan who puts on a cowboy hat when he knows the mission is committed .
Slim Pickens plays this role .
He and Keenan Wynn as a foggy colonel are the funniest individuals in the film .
As I say , there are parts of this satire that are almost beyond compare .
On the other hand , I am troubled by the feeling , which runs all through the film , of discredit and even contempt for our whole defense establishment , up to and even including the hypothetical Commander in Chief .
It is all right to show the general who starts this wild foray as a Communist - hating madman , convinced that a " Red conspiracy " is fluoridating our water in order to pollute our precious body fluids .
That is pointed satire , and Sterling Hayden plays the role with just a right blend of wackiness and meanness to give the character significance .
But when virtually everybody turns up stupid or insane -- or , what is worse , psychopathic -- I want to know what this picture proves .
The President , played by Peter Sellers with a shiny bald head , is a dolt , whining and unavailing with the nation in a life - or - death spot .
But worse yet , his technical expert , Dr. Strangelove , whom Mr. Sellers also plays , is a devious and noxious ex - German whose mechanical arm insists on making the Nazi salute .
And , oddly enough , the only character who seems to have much common sense is a British flying officer , whom Mr. Sellers - - yes , he again -- plays .
The ultimate touch of ghoulish humor is when we see the bomb actually going off , dropped on some point in Russia , and a jazzy sound track comes in with a cheerful melodic rendition of " We'll Meet Again Some Sunny Day . "
Somehow , to me , it is n't funny .
It is malefic and sick .

It 's a theory set to confirm why humans are so fond of fatty foods such as chips and chocolate cake : in addition to the five tastes already identified lurks another detectable by the palate -- fat .
" We know that the human tongue can detect five tastes -- sweet , salty , sour , bitter and umami ( a savoury , protein - rich taste contained in foods such as soy sauce and chicken stock ) , " Russell Keast , from Deakin University , said Monday .
" Through our study we can conclude that humans have a sixth taste -- fat . "
Researchers tested 30 people 's ability to taste a range of fatty acids in otherwise plain solutions and found that all were able to determine the taste -- though some required higher concentrations than others .
They then developed a screening test to see how sensitive people were to the taste and found that , of the 50 people tested , their ability to detect fat was linked to their weight -- a finding which could help counter obesity .
" We found that the people who were sensitive to fat , who could taste very low concentrations , actually consumed less fat than the people who were insensitive , " Keast told AFP .
" We also found that they had lower BMIs ( Body Mass Indexes ) . "
Keast said the research , conducted in collaboration with the University of Adelaide , New Zealand 's Massey University and Australian science body CSIRO , suggested that the taste of fat could trigger a mechanism in the body .
" We all like eating fatty foods .
What we speculate is ( that ) the mechanism is to do with stopping eating .
Your body is able to tell you you 've had enough and stop , " he explained .
" And if you are insensitive to it , you 're not getting that feedback . "
With fats easily accessible and commonly consumed , it was possible that people may become desensitised to the taste of fat , leaving some more prone to overindulging in calorie - rich foods , he added .
The results , published in the British Journal of Nutrition , have not definitively classified fat as a taste but Keast says the evidence is strong and mounting .
For something to be classified as a taste there needed to be proven receptor mechanisms on taste cells in the mouth , he said .
" We have what ... we will call possible candidate receptors for fat on taste receptor cells , " he said .

The Cretaceous - Tertiary mass extinction , which wiped out the dinosaurs and more than half of species on Earth , was caused by an asteroid colliding with Earth and not massive volcanic activity , according to a comprehensive review of all the available evidence , published in the journal Science .
A panel of 41 international experts , including UK researchers from Imperial College London , the University of Cambridge , University College London and the Open University , reviewed 20 years ' worth of research to determine the cause of the Cretaceous - Tertiary ( KT ) extinction , which happened around 65 million years ago .
The extinction wiped out more than half of all species on the planet , including the dinosaurs , bird - like pterosaurs and large marine reptiles , clearing the way for mammals to become the dominant species on Earth .
The new review of the evidence shows that the extinction was caused by a massive asteroid slamming into Earth at Chicxulub ( pronounced chick - shoo - loob ) in Mexico .
The asteroid , which was around 15 kilometres wide , is believed to have hit Earth with a force one billion times more powerful than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima .
It would have blasted material at high velocity into the atmosphere , triggering a chain of events that caused a global winter , wiping out much of life on Earth in a matter of days .
Scientists have previously argued about whether the extinction was caused by the asteroid or by volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps in India , where there were a series of super volcanic eruptions that lasted approximately 1.5 million years .
These eruptions spewed 1,100,000 km3 of basalt lava across the Deccan Traps , which would have been enough to fill the Black Sea twice , and were thought to have caused a cooling of the atmosphere and acid rain on a global scale .
In the new study , scientists analysed the work of palaeontologists , geochemists , climate modellers , geophysicists and sedimentologists who have been collecting evidence about the KT extinction over the last 20 years .
Geological records show that the event that triggered the extinction destroyed marine and land ecosystems rapidly , according to the researchers , who conclude that the Chicxulub asteroid impact is the only plausible explanation for this .
Despite evidence for relatively active volcanism in Deccan Traps at the time , marine and land ecosystems showed only minor changes within the 500,000 years before the time of the KT extinction .
Furthermore , computer models and observational data suggest that the release of gases such as sulphur into the atmosphere after each volcanic eruption in the Deccan Traps would have had a short lived effect on the planet .
These would not cause enough damage to create a rapid mass extinction of land and marine species .
Dr Joanna Morgan , co-author of the review from the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London , said : " We now have great confidence that an asteroid was the cause of the KT extinction .
This triggered large - scale fires , earthquakes measuring more than 10 on the Richter scale , and continental landslides , which created tsunamis .
However , the final nail in the coffin for the dinosaurs happened when blasted material was ejected at high velocity into the atmosphere .
This shrouded the planet in darkness and caused a global winter , killing off many species that could n't adapt to this hellish environment . "
Dr Gareth Collins , Natural Environment Research Council Fellow and another co-author from the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London , added : " The asteroid was about the size of the Isle of Wight and hit Earth 20 times faster than a speeding bullet .
The explosion of hot rock and gas would have looked like a huge ball of fire on the horizon , grilling any living creature in the immediate vicinity that could n't find shelter .
Ironically , while this hellish day signalled the end of the 160 million year reign of the dinosaurs , it turned out to be a great day for mammals , who had lived in the shadow of the dinosaurs prior to this event .
The KT extinction was a pivotal moment in Earth 's history , which ultimately paved the way for humans to become the dominant species on Earth . "
In the review , the panel sifted through past studies to analyse the evidence that linked the asteroid impact and volcanic activity with the KT extinction .
One key piece of evidence was the abundance of iridium in geological samples around the world from the time of the extinction .
Iridium is very rare in Earth 's crust and very common in asteroids .
Immediately after the iridium layer , there is a dramatic decline in fossil abundance and species , indicating that the KT extinction followed very soon after the asteroid hit .
Another direct link between the asteroid impact and the extinction is evidence of ' shocked ' quartz in geological records .
Quartz is shocked when hit very quickly by a massive force and these minerals are only found at nuclear explosion sites and at meteorite impacts sites .
The team say that an abundance of shocked quartz in rock layers all around the world at the KT boundary lends further weight to their conclusions that a massive meteorite impact happened at the time of the mass extinction .
The panel was able to discount previous studies that suggested that the Chicxulub impact occurred 300,000 years prior to the KT extinction .
The researchers say that these studies had misinterpreted geological data that was gathered close to the Chicxulub impact site .
This is because the rocks close to the impact zone underwent complex geological processes after the initial asteroid collision , which made it difficult to interpret the data correctly .
Nick Clegg today said that it was a " scandal " that Britain did not have the capacity to produce the giant turbines needed for the offshore wind farms being planned for the North and Irish seas .
On a visit to Newcastle , the Liberal Democrat leader said that disused shipyards should be upgraded to allow them to produce the new equipment .
Under a Lib Dem plan , all port authorities on the North Sea and Irish Sea would be able to bid for a share of a £ 400 m pot to convert shipyards into wind turbine plants .
Clegg said : " We need to make sure we come out of this recession with a rebalanced and green economy .
" New offshore turbines , with blades the size of the London Eye , need to be built and launched from modern docks , so we need to upgrade our shipyards to take advantage of this massive opportunity .
" Just imagine the docks and shipyards along the coastline of Britain coming to life and leading the world in this new technology .
" Expanding offshore wind will create jobs but unless we act now , these jobs wo n't be British jobs .
It 's a scandal that 90 % of the £ 1.75 bn contract for a wind farm off the coast of Kent is going to foreign contractors , with the turbines being manufactured in Germany . "
He went on : " Investing in infrastructure for a new green economy not only helps create jobs now but will allow Britain to take its place at the cutting edge of this growing industrial sector for the future .
" Britain clearly has the manufacturing and engineering expertise to lead the world in this green technology but government must play its part in supporting this . "
The Lib Dems believe 6,400 new offshore wind turbines will be needed to meet targets on renewable energy .
Conversion of shipyards would involve upgrading to make them suitable for construction and testing of turbines .
They would also need to be deep enough for the boats needed to transport the blades and towers to the sites of wind farms in the North and Irish seas .
Man and the universe as a whole are spiritual rather than material in nature and that truth and good are real , whereas evil and error are unreal .
Christian Scientists believe that only through prayer and knowing and understanding God will this be demonstrated .

Last week , a woman named Liz Heywood had been planning to go share her story directly with the White House representatives at the Secular Coalition of America briefing .
Unfortunately , weather prevented her flight from arriving .
She instead sent a statement , which was read by an SCA staffer at the meeting .
It is a must - read : go read the full text over at the Friendly Atheist The highlights :
When she was 13 , her knee swelled up " like a melon . "
It was later learned that she had a strep - infection in her joint : while it is serious , when caught immediately it is treatable .
But sheHer parents were Christian Scientists : they believed that the real world is an illusion .
Here 's wikipedia on the subject :
There 's the crux of the issue .
In Christian Science , prayer is theform of medicine .
She remained bedridden for nearly a year , in horrible pain .
She survived , her leg " scarred tThe worst part about all this :
Child abuse laws in 30 states have exemptions from neglect in cases of " faith healing .
" Another astonishing fact from this New York Times article -- 300 children have died over the past 30 years when treatment was withheld on religious grounds .
In their defense of prayer , many religious people assert that it gives one peace of mind .
At the very least , does n't do any harm .
Liz Heywood and those poor 300 children are direct evidence against this statement .
She would have her leg , and those children would have her lives , were it not for their parent 's belief in the " healing power " of prayer .
Critics could counter that this is an extreme example , and therefore does n't apply to prayer in general .
That is false - it merely demonstrates something that is always true about prayer .
One of my favorite quotes is that " Two hands working can do more than a thousand clasped in prayer . "
This is especially true when , by forsaking work , those hands clasped in prayer allow their children to suffer and die .
This is neglectful homicide , and we should all work to ensure that religious exemptions come off the books .

According to a study published by the UN the world must start doing more to cope with the growing problem of e-waste that is being produced .
The study says that the amount of e-waste which includes mobile phones and computers could grow as much as 500 % over the next 10 years in some countries including China , India and Africa nations .
The report has stated that electronic waste is piling up at a rate of 40 million tonnes a year , 2.6 million tonnes comes from China and the USA is producing 3.3 million tonnes .
Many developing nations are happy to take e-waste from other countries in order to extract some of the precious materials from them .
It has been said that the world was not prepared to handle the explosion of electronic gadgets over the past 10 years .
The world is now confronted with a massive wave of e-waste that has come back and hit us , particularly in third world countries that have become a dumping ground .
The study has also predicted that unless something is done China ’s waste rate from old computers will quadruple from 2007 levels by 2020 .
Unless the e-waste problem is dealt with properly and reduced it could cause major environmental problems and even threaten public health the report has warned .
Help the growing e-waste problem and recycle your old mobile phone today
Biden vs. Biden on Iraq
Vice president Joseph Biden is the administration ’s point man on managing U.S. involvement in Iraqi political reconciliation ; the same man whose idea it was to partition Iraq along ethnic lines only a few years ago .
In fact , then Senator Biden got 75 Senators to pass a resolution in 2007 calling for Iraq to partitioned into Shiite , Sunni , and Kurd regions with considerable autonomy , even getting then Senator Hillary Clinton ( but not Senator Barack Obama ) to go along .
Now he travels to and from Baghdad pressing Iraqi politicians to eschew ethnic differences and come together to compromise and meld their political efforts .
That irony did n’t go unnoticed by Samir Shakir Mahmoud Sumaida ’ie , Iraq ’s Ambassador to the United States , who remarked about the transformation of Biden ’s thinking at an event hosted by the George Washington University Wednesday .
" He does n’t talk about that [ partition idea ] anymore , when that is brought up he sort of waves it away , " he said , adding that Biden ’s " understanding of the situation has deepened and is remarkable .
Now he really has got his finger on the pulse . "
Biden ’s latest interventions in Iraq are welcome and the vice president takes care to make sure he is not dictating to the Iraqis , he added .
So did Biden ’s idea have any value at the time ?
According to Sumaida ’ie , yes … but not the way Biden intended .
" This idea of three federal units … never flew .
In fact , it created such a reaction in Iraq , it unified everybody .
Everybody dropped their arms and said , ‘ We are against this , ’ " he explained , " Once they made their point they started to fight again . "
The Iraqi elections are Sunday .
For the first time , voters can choose individual candidates rather than having to select only prearranged lists .
This reduces the power of sectarian political leaders who compile the lists .
Such reforms are the best ways to mend sectarian wounds , Sumaida ’ie said .
He rejected the conventional wisdom about Iraq ’s population .
" This simplified understanding of Iraq is simply not accurate , that Iraq is made up of Sunnis , Shiites and Kurds who are mutually exclusive and at each other ’s throats all the time .
That ’s not how it is , " he said , " We caught sectarianism as one might catch a cold , we are capable of recovering from it .
We are not Northern Ireland . "
So what exactly is Biden ’s role in handling the Iraq issue ?
The New York Times puts it this way :
Judge orders casino company , insurer to pay $ 800 M to Vegas shooting victims
A court on Wednesday approved a total of $ 800 million US in payout cash from casino company MGM Resorts International and its insurers to more than 4,400 relatives and victims of the Las Vegas strip shooting that was the deadliest in recent U.S. history .
Terminal Lance # 12 “ Tom Clancy is Full of Shit ”
Does anyone remember the Splinter Cell games ?
I know I do .
While I always preferred Metal Gear Solid , I always enjoyed how high speed I felt playing as Sam Fisher .
In the videogames and movies , night vision is clear , useful , and makes a fucking awesome “ bweee ! ” noise when you turn it on .
In real life , unfortunately , it is none of those things .
The current generation of PVS - 14 ’s fucking suck .
Yes , they ’re night vision and obviously they have their uses on the battlefield , but it ’s never as cool as in the movies or games .
I would be amiss to say that Solid Snake was n’t 50 % of the reason I joined the Marines in the first place .
I think it can be said that movies and games influence all of us subconsciously to do something as ridiculous as join the military .
It ’s all so incredible , so badass to do what you see on TV .
To be the guy that people make movies and games about , that ’s pretty awesome .
But of course , none of us are really Solid Snake .
None of us are Sam Fisher , and none of us ever will be .
While I would n’t go as far as to say that war movies and games are great recruiting tools , I would say that it would be nice if they did a bit of research and made the tools they show realistic .
Maybe next time you turn on your NVG ’s in Splinter Cell , Sam trips over a piece of trash or something because he has a 5 degree viewing cone and ca n’t see a fucking thing in front of him .
Howabout the part where you ’re adjusting the brightness and contrast of your NVG ’s to get a better picture , or smacking it to keep it from flickering …?
Naw , I doubt they ’ll put any of that in there –that would be too realistic .
If people did n’t have the fantasy , those games would n’t be any fun .
I ’d like to announce the opening of the Terminal Lance Store , hosted by Printfection .
It ’s basically like Cafepress , but I liked it more because it was cheaper and had more color options .
Get to the store by clicking on the “ Store ” tab at the top of the screen .
I think the “ Terminal Lance ” skivvy shirts will be a hot seller .
In an effort to be honest to my loyal readers , I ’d like to note that I have already received the skivvy that I ordered .
I wore it today under my cammies .
While it is not exactly OD Green , the “ Military Green ” color offered by Printfection suffices as a true skivvy shirt .
It ’s slightly paler than I thought it would be , but it gives it the “ Salty ” look we all want anyway .
Overall , the product is a pretty high quality print .
Victoria ’s Secret is known for its quality lingerie , but the models who wear the lingerie might be more recognizable .
The new Victoria ’s Secret “ Body For Everybody , Love Your Body ” ad campaign encourages women to admire the body they have .
It promotes the addition of three new styles to the lingerie company ’s best - selling Body by Victoria bra collection .
The mini-collection is titled “ ’ Love My Body ” and introduces the newest faces to join the notorious line up of VS supermodels .
I always endorse any publicity that initiates women to appreciate their body type , regardless of shape and size .
I believe health should triumph the external desire to be thin .
Yet , when I look at the ad with the words “ I love my body ” next to lanky , goddesses of women , I do n’t have the urge to love my body .
Actually , my reaction is quite the opposite .
I felt almost insulted and thought the tone seemed more narcissistic than supportive .
I ’m sure most women ’s reactions when they look at any Victoria ’s Secret model is not complete admiration for their own body in comparison .
Envy , insecurity , motivation to go to the gym and put down the cookie is what comes to mind when I look at scantily clad Victoria ’s Secret models .
The Victoria ’s Secret latest ad campaign appears to mimic Dove ’s “ Campaign for Real Beauty . ”
The vital difference is the Dove campaign does feature a diverse group of women who represent various body sizes , shapes and ages .
Victoria ’s Secret ’s “ Love Your Body ” does nothing more than put more young , slender , tanned and toned women in a bra and panties .
How original .
Certainly all women deal with personal insecurities and body image issues that may lie deeper than what spectators can imagine .
I ’m sure even Victoria ’s Secret models have bad days when they look at the girl next to them and feel insecure about their own self - conceived problem areas .
However , they are glorified for their impeccable body and faces , so I ’m sure they get over any issues rather quickly .
Dove went against the normal stereotypes by showcasing women who looked confident , healthy and larger than a size 2 .
The campaign Dove launched in 2004 was empowering and advocated women to learn how to love every bump , curve or other imperfection that did n’t fall into line with what society has deemed as beautiful .
One would imagine if Victoria ’s Secret was serious about its ad campaign aimed for women to “ Love Your Body , ” it would include more than the stereotypical lingerie and swimsuit model in the campaign .
The theme for the new collection is the promotion that there ’s a “ body ” or bra for everyone , so put women of all figures into the ads to actually show that .
My post last night on Dennis Ross was right on time .
Laura Rozen at politico reports that Ross is at the center of a battle within the Obama administration about how nice to be to Israel .
The piece includes a frank statement of confused loyalty :
“ He [ Ross ] seems to be far more sensitive to Netanyahu ’s coalition politics than to U.S. interests , ” one U.S. official told POLITICO Saturday .
“ And he does n’t seem to understand that this has become bigger than Jerusalem but is rather about the credibility of this Administration . ”
Let me repeat myself .
This guy is the living embodiment of the Israel lobby .
He was till recently chairman of the Jerusalem - based Jewish People Policy Planning Institute , which opposes intermarriage , among other charming and important campaigns .
Aaron David Miller said that the U.S. too often acted as " Israel ’s lawyer " at Camp David ; and that meant Ross .
Dan Kurtzer ’s book , Negotiating Arab - Israeli Peace , said that the US team lacked diversity and cross-cultural expertise– again , ethnocentric Ross .
Kurtzer and co-author Scott Lasensky write : " ’ The perception always was that Dennis [ Ross ] started from the Israeli bottom line , ’ said a prominent Arab negotiator , ‘ that he listened to what Israel wanted and then tried to sell it to the Arabs . ’ "
No wonder Kurtzer lamented " the deference that some policymakers pay to Israeli domestic political concerns .
Israel plays an outsized role in U.S. politics and diplomacy … "
The lobby ; and Ross denied the existence of the lobby when it was under attack , because it was his own power base .
Netanyahu ’s AIPAC speech last week was so shocking that it has rung in a new era for the lobby .
Basically : the F.U. period , overplaying its hand in plain sight of the American people .
The ( in ) ability of an American administration to free itself of Ross is a real test of the perseverance of the lobby in our politics .
More on Ross : this was in the original RSS feed on the Politico piece but is not in the published version :
Ross , the U.S. official continued , “ starts from the premise that U.S. and Israeli interests overlap by something close to 100 percent .
And if we diverge , then , he says , the Arabs increase their demands unreasonably .
Since we can’t have demanding Arabs , therefore we must rush to close gaps with the Israelis , no matter what the cost to our broader credibility . ”
This is the old neocon delusion , in order to support their loyalty to Israel ’s interests : there is no difference between our interests and Israel’s .
A preposterous assertion , for any two states .
proxy – gen-class little brother
Clojure provides two basic ways to interface with the host platform .
The more comprehending is gen-class which I touched in [ a previous post ] gc .
It 's little brother is proxy .
Although less powerful it is more dynamic than gen-class .
Let 's see how it works …
The Anatomy of `proxy`
So what is actually the difference between gen-class and proxy ?
gen-class creates a named class while proxy does not 1 .
This has some serious consequences .
The most notable is that proxy cannot add methods to objects it creates .
So you can only implement interfaces and extend classes by implementing their methods .
On the other hand you do n't need AOT compilation .
Otherwise proxy is similar to gen-class .
The object instantiated by proxy gets stubs for the methods which just look up usual clojure functions in a map .
This means proxy - methods are normal ( though anonymous ) clojure functions and in particular they close over their environment .
If a method is not found in the proxy 's map the stub throws an UnsupportedOperationException or calls the super 's method .
PIA – `proxy` in action
Let 's compare proxy to our previous examples .
( defn make - some - example [ ] ( proxy [ Object ] [ ] ( toString [ ]
" Hello , World ! " ) ) )
As we do n't get a named class from proxy but some anonymous object there is obviously no constructor to call .
So we just define a function calling proxy .
user= > ( .toString ( make - some - example ) ) " Hello , World ! "
In the above example we extended a pre-existing class – in this case Object .
But we can also implement interfaces without specifying a super class 2 .
( defn make - some - example [ ] ( proxy [ clojure.lang.IDeref ] [ ] ( deref [ ]
" Hello , World ! " ) ) )
As you would expect , we can now use @ and deref on our object .
user= > @ ( make - some - example ) " Hello , World ! "
The next step for gen-class examples was to add some state to the object .
While this was rather troublesome in the gen-class case – we had to add a constructor and some state holding field – the situation in the proxy case is much simpler .
The methods are actually closures .
So we can simply close over any non-constant attributes !
( defn make - some - example [ msg ] ( proxy [ clojure.lang.IDeref ] [ ] ( deref [ ] msg ) ) )
Now we simply pass the required parameters to the factory function .
user= > @ ( make - some - example " Hallo , Welt ! " )
" Hallo , Welt ! "
And finally we can use the same trick to also allow modifications .
( defn make - some - example [ msg ] ( let [ state ( atom msg ) ] ( proxy [ clojure.lang.IDeref ] [ ] ( toString [ ] @ state ) ( deref [ ] state ) ) ) )
As before we now simply close over the atom to allow access later on .
user= > ( def o ( make - some - example " Hallo , Welt ! " ) ) #' user / o user= > ( .toString o ) " Hallo , Welt ! " user= > ( reset !
@ o " Здравей , свят " ) " Здравей , свят " user= > ( .toString o )
" Здравей , свя т "
Please note how we had to hijack the deref method from clojure .
lang .
IDeref since we cannot add a new method state as we did in the [ gen-class examples ] gc .
I do n't recommend doing so in a real world program .
Super Methods
Since we can also override the methods of a super class with proxy we have also the possibility of calling out to the super 's method .
One particular application I had for this was to define some offset for a LineNumbering PushbackReader .
( defn make - offset - reader [ reader offset ] ( proxy [ clojure.lang.LineNumberingPushbackReader ] [ reader ] ( getLineNumber [ ] ( + offset ( proxy - super getLineNumber ) ) ) ) )
So what happens ?
We create a proxy to a LineNumbering PushbackReader .
We use whatever reader we are given and pass it on to the super 's constructor .
Since we proxy a class all methods which are not defined for the proxy instance are forwarded to the corresponding super method .
We just intercept calls to .getLineNumber .
Here we call the super method but add the offset before returning the result .
Multiple Arities
There is two special cases concerning methods :
a method with several arities
a method with different argument types
So consider a class like this one .
class Example { void someMethod ( String x ) { doSomethingWithString(x ) ; } void someMethod ( Integer x ) { doSomething WithInteger( x ) ; } }
Both methods are mapped to the same proxy method .
So you have to test in your function to see , which version was the intended one .
( proxy [ Example ] [ ] ( someMethod [ x ] ( condp instance ?
x String ( .doSomethingWithString this x ) Integer ( .doSomethingWithInteger this x ) ) ) )
Another problem is connected to proxy - super .
Again an example :
class Example { void someMethod ( String x ) { someMethod( x , null ) } void someMethod ( String x , String y ) { doSomething With( x , y ) ; } }
You want to override the 2 - ary version of the method .
So you start out with a pretty straight forward proxy call .
( proxy [ Example ] [ ] ( someMethod [ x y ] ( .doMoreStuff this x y ) ) )
Arg .
But this does n't work , because the function is called for all arities .
So we have to add the 1 - ary version also .
But we do n't want to override the 1 - ary version .
No problem !
We simply call proxy - super as we saw above .
( proxy [ Example ] [ ] ( someMethod ( [ x ] ( proxy - super someMethod x ) ) ( [ x y ] ( .doMoreStuff this x y ) ) ) )
Cool , eh ?
But not working as expected .
Our overriden 2 - ary version is not called …
To understand what 's going wrong , we have to understand how proxy - super works .
And that is quite easy .
When calling a method on a proxy object , the corresponding function is looked up in the proxy 's method map .
If there is no entry , the super 's method is invoked ( or an UnsupportedOperationException is thrown in case it was an interface method ) .
So what does proxy - super do ?
It simply remove the map entry , calls the method in the proxy instance again and restores the map entry afterwards .
But wait !
What happens when inside our class the 1 - ary version calls the 2 - ary version ?
The map entry is missing and the super 's method is called !
Not our override as expected !
The magic `this`
As the well - disposed reader might already have noticed there is another difference between proxy and gen-class in terms of how methods are defined .
While the methods for gen-class take the object as first argument ( and can thus it can be named whatever you like ) proxy captures the symbol this in a similar way Java does .
So in a proxy method this will always refer to the instance at hand .
However there is a gotcha !
Clojure does not stop you from creating a local this .
Together with proxy - super dangerous waters lie ahead .
( proxy [ Object ] [ ] ( toString [ ] ( let [ this " huh ? " ] ( proxy - super toString ) ) ) )
In this case we get an exception .
But in general there might lurk subtle bugs .
So watch out !
user= > ( .toString ( proxy [ Object ] [ ] ( toString [ ] ( let [ this " huh ? " ] ( proxy - super toString ) ) ) ) ) #< CompilerException java.lang.ClassCastException : java.lang .
String cannot be cast to clojure.lang .
IProxy ( REPL:2 ) >
Upshot
So here a short summary .
proxy does not require AOT compilation less ceremony for parameters more dynamic than gen-class can only implement pre-defined methods beware of this and proxy - super details
gen - class generates a named class can define custom methods allows to carry state in a special field more ceremony requires AOT compilation
In most cases a combination of proxy and gen-interface is to be preferred over gen-class .
Footnotes
This is strictly speaking not true .
There is an underlying class created by proxy .
But in general you cannot ( and should not ) access it directly .
( cf. get - proxy - class )
)
In this case Object will be the super class .

Here 's a general degree -n polynomial :
To evaluate such a polynomial using a computer program , several approaches can be employed .
The simplest , naive method is to compute each term of the polynomial separately and then add them up .
Here 's the Python code for it :
def poly_naive ( A , x ) : p = 0 for i , a in enumerate ( A ) : p += ( x ** i ) * a return p
A is an array of coefficients , lowest first , until .
This method is quite inefficient .
It requires n additions ( since there are n+1 terms to be added ) and multiplications .
Iterative method
It 's obvious that there 's a lot of repetitive computations being done by raising x to successive powers .
We can make things much more efficient by simply keeping the previous power of x between iterations .
This is the " iterative method " : def poly_iter ( A , x ) : p = 0 xn = 1 for a in A : p += xn * a xn *= x return p
In this code xn is the current power of x .
We do n't need to raise x to a power on each iteration of the loop , a single multiplication suffices .
It 's easy to see that there are 2n multiplications and n additions for each computation .
The algorithm is now linear instead of quadratic .
Das Amtsgericht Hannover , die zuständige Staatsanwaltschaft und die Polizei sind auf der CeBIT gegen Verletzer von Patent - , Urheber - und Markenrechten vorgegangen .
Wie die Behörden am Mittwoch mitteilten , seien insgesamt 28 Anzeigen erstattet worden , meist wegen angeblich unberechtigten Ausstellens von elektronischen Geräten mit MP3 - Funktion sowie DVB - tauglichen Produkten wie TV - Receivern .
Bei Kontrollen der fraglichen Messestände seien dann 14 Schutzrechtsverletzungen festgestellt worden .
Anders als in früheren Jahren quartierten sich diesmal zwei Ermittlungsrichter gleich bei der Polizei auf dem Messegelände ein .
In acht Fällen hätten diese auf Antrag der Staatsanwaltschaft eine Beschlagnahmung rechtsverletzender Gegenstände und Materialien angeordnet und Sicherheitsleistungen in Höhe der zu erwartenden Geldstrafen oder Geldbußen und Verfahrenskosten festgesetzt .
Da sich alle Beschuldigten einsichtig und kooperativ gezeigt hätten , seien keine Durchsuchungen nötig gewesen , heißt es. ( pmz )
CAMBRIDGE , Mass . --
A team of scientists at MIT have discovered a previously unknown phenomenon that can cause powerful waves of energy to shoot through minuscule wires known as carbon nanotubes .
The discovery could lead to a new way of producing electricity , the researchers say .
The phenomenon , described as thermopower waves , " opens up a new area of energy research , which is rare , " says Michael Strano , MIT 's Charles and Hilda Roddey Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering , who was the senior author of a paper describing the new findings that appeared in Nature Materials on March 7 .
The lead author was Wonjoon Choi , a doctoral student in mechanical engineering .
Like a collection of flotsam propelled along the surface by waves traveling across the ocean , it turns out that a thermal wave -- a moving pulse of heat -- traveling along a microscopic wire can drive electrons along , creating an electrical current .
The key ingredient in the recipe is carbon nanotubes -- submicroscopic hollow tubes made of a chicken - wire - like lattice of carbon atoms .
These tubes , just a few billionths of a meter ( nanometers ) in diameter , are part of a family of novel carbon molecules , including buckyballs and graphene sheets , that have been the subject of intensive worldwide research over the last two decades .
In the new experiments , each of these electrically and thermally conductive nanotubes was coated with a layer of a highly reactive fuel that can produce heat by decomposing .
This fuel was then ignited at one end of the nanotube using either a laser beam or a high - voltage spark , and the result was a fast - moving thermal wave traveling along the length of the carbon nanotube like a flame speeding along the length of a lit fuse .
Heat from the fuel goes into the nanotube where it travels thousands of times faster than in the fuel itself .
As the heat feeds back to the fuel coating , a thermal wave is created that is guided along the nanotube .
With a temperature of 3,000 kelvins , this ring of heat speads along the tube 10,000 times faster than the normal spread of this chemical reaction .
The heating produced by that combustion , it turns out , also pushes electrons along the tube , creating a substantial electrical current .
Combustion waves -- like this pulse of heat hurtling along a wire -- " have been studied mathematically for more than 100 years , " Strano says , but he was the first to predict that such waves could be guided by a nanotube or nanowire and that this wave of heat could push an electrical current along that wire .
In the group 's initial experiments , Strano says , when they wired up the carbon nanotubes with their fuel coating in order to study the reaction , " lo and behold , we were really surprised by the size of the resulting voltage peak " that propagated along the wire .
After further development , the system now puts out energy , in proportion to its weight , about 100 times greater than an equivalent weight of lithium - ion battery .
The amount of power released , he says , is much greater than that predicted by thermoelectric calculations .
While many semiconductor materials can produce an electric potential when heated , through something called the Seebeck effect , that effect is very weak in carbon .
" There 's something else happening here , " he says .
" We call it electron entrainment since part of the current appears to scale with wave velocity . "
The thermal wave , he explains , appears to be entraining the electrical charge carriers ( either electrons or electron holes ) just as an ocean wave can pick up and carry a collection of debris along the surface .
This important property is responsible for the high power produced by the system , Strano says .
Because this is such a new discovery , he says , it 's hard to predict yet exactly what the practical applications will be .
But he suggests that one possible application would be in enabling new kinds of ultra-small electronic devices -- for example , a devices the size of grains of rice , perhaps a sensor or treatment device that could be injected into the body .
Or it could lead to " environmental sensors that could be scattered like dust in the air , " he says .
In theory , he says , such devices could maintain their power indefinitely until used , unlike batteries whose charge leaks away gradually as they sit unused .
And while the individual nanowires are tiny , Strano suggests that they could be made in large arrays in order to supply significant amounts of power for larger devices .
One area the researchers plan to pursue is the fact that their theory predicts that using different kinds of reactive materials for the coating , the wave front could oscillate , thus producing an alternating current .
That opens up a variety of possibilities , Strano says , because alternating current is the basis for radio waves such as cell phone transmissions , but present energy - storage systems all produce direct current .
" Our theory predicted these oscillations before we began to observe them in our data , " he says .
Also , the present versions of the system have low efficiency , because much power is being given off as heat and light .
The team plans to work on improving that efficiency .

The class action suit has been filed in the US District court for Northern District in California and concerns the privacy changes that Facebook made at the end of last year .
The suit has been filed by five Facebook members on their behalf and on behalf of all Facebook users .
While Facebook claims privacy changes actually increased the level of privacy for users , the lawsuit says the average user 's privacy is now decreased .
Before the changes , information was only available to friends .
Anyone not approved as a friend would only see a name and network .
After the change , however , much more information is left available to be seen , including pictures , friends lists , organisations the user may follow and geographical information .
It 's not clear what damages the lawsuit is seeking but it does say the message Facebook gave its users about the changes was , " misleading , confusing and disingenuous .
"
The lawsuit says , “ Changes to the privacy settings that Facebook implemented and represented to increase User privacy had the outright opposite effect of resulting in the public dissemination of personal information that was originally private .
"
The lawsuit also says users now have 29 privacy settings with which to contend and those settings are spread over a number of pages .
It also alleges many users are unaware of what information they have left for people to see .
The lawsuit says , “ The privacy setting procedures are grossly ineffective and users are misled into allowing Facebook to having their personal information easily accessed for commercial use , exposing them to identity theft , harassment , embarrassment , intrusion and all types of cybercrime .
" When Facebook announced the changes last year , it faced criticism from various sources .
Critics argued personal information would be exposed without users knowing it .
In his Electric Frontier Foundation blog last December , Kevin Bankston wrote : " Our conclusion ?
These new " privacy " changes are clearly intended to push Facebook users to publicly share even more information than before .
Even worse , the changes will actually reduce the amount of control that users have over some of their personal data . "

Manufacturer Western Digital Model Caviar Black 1TB
( WD1002FAEX ) Price ( street ) Availability Now
Western Digital ’s 640 GB
Caviar hard drives have found their way into each and every one of our system guides for just about two years now .
We ’ve recommended one flavor or another across a wide range of systems , including our budget Econobox , the mid-range Grand Experiment , and even the modestly opulent Sweeter Spot build .
Indeed , the 640 GB Caviars have been one of the best examples of the proverbial sweet spot in recent memory .
As all half - dozen or so of our female readers can no doubt attest , the sweet spot can be difficult to find .
You ’ll know when you ’ve found it , though .
The original Caviar SE16 640 GB debuted with all the right ingredients : two of the highest - density platters available at the time , a 7,200 - RPM spindle speed , low noise levels , reasonable power consumption , an affordable price tag , and best - in - class performance across a diverse range of sequential , random , synthetic , and real - world tests .
For obvious reasons , the SE16 became an instant favorite among enthusiasts .
Eventually , it was supplanted by the Caviar Black .
Largely the same drive as the SE16 , the Black doubled the cache to 32MB and bumped the warranty up to five years .
And since the 640 GB flavor was still a lower capacity than then - flagship terabytes , you could still get it cheap .
That ’s like taking the sweet spot , drizzling it with chocolate sauce , and then adding bacon .
Even I could n’t resist and bought two for the RAID 1 array in my personal desktop .
The uncanny ability to combine top performance with low noise levels is what really made the 640 GB Caviars so special .
Higher - end terabyte drives were louder at the time , likely because they needed to use three or four platters to hit the 1TB mark .
640 GB only took two platters , which meant less weight for the drive motor to spin , less power consumed , and less heat generated , too .
Naturally , we ’ve been eagerly anticipating the 640 GB Caviar ’s spiritual successor : a two - platter Caviar Black that uses Western Digital ’s latest 500 GB platters .
This next step up the areal density ladder debuted more than a year ago inside a low - power , two - terabyte Caviar Green .
Some eight months later , the very same platters spun up to a full 7,200 RPM inside the Caviar Black ’s shot at the 2TB mark .
And now , finally , Western Digital is putting them in a two - platter Caviar Black .
Platter capacity is so important to mechanical hard drives because it plays a large role in defining overall drive performance .
What really matters is the platter ’s areal density how many bits it squeezes into a given unit area .
The higher the areal density , the more data the drive head can access over a given physical distance .
Platters that have the same total capacity do n’t necessarily share the same areal density , though .
For example , Seagate ’s Barracuda XT 2TB features 500GB platters that have an areal density of 347 Gb/in² , while Western Digital ’s 500GB platters squeeze 400 gigabits into every square inch .
Advantage , WD .
Dacking data so densely under the drive head will speed sequential transfers , but it can make seeking random sectors more difficult .
To give you an idea of what kind of precision is required , consider that data points on the surface of a 3.5 ″ platter spinning at 7,200 RPM are moving at up to the equivalent of about 120 km /h .
WD ’s 500GB platters have a track width of roughly 100 nanometers one thousand times narrower than a human hair .
The drive head , which sits at the end of an actuator arm several inches in length , must be capable of darting from track to track in milliseconds , all while flying within nanometers of the surface of the platter .
To help it track quickly in such challenging conditions , the 2TB Caviar Black employs a secondary actuator stage powered by a tiny piezoelectric motor perched at the tip of the drive arm .
This second stage gives the drive head 500 nanometers of fine - tuning precision beyond what ’s offered by the main actuator .
However , this dual - stage approach has n’t trickled down to the 1TB Black , which uses a single - stage design .
Western Digital said the 2TB
Black would have been slower without the dual - stage actuator , so it seems likely that some performance has been left on the table by not including it in the 1TB model .
Maximum external transfer rate 600 MB/s Maximum sustained data rate 126MB /s Average rotational latency 4.2 ms Spindle speed 7,200 RPM
Cache size 64MB Platter size 500GB Areal density 400 Gb/ in² Available capacities 1TB Idle power 6.1W Read / write power 6.8W Idle acoustics 28 dBA Seek acoustics 33 dBA Warranty length Five years
Of course , Western Digital ’s own datasheets already concede that the new 1TB Black is going to be a little slower than its four - platter , 2TB cousin .
The 1TB drive has a maximum sustained data rate of 126MB/s , while the 2TB model can sustain speeds of up to 138 MB /s .
That discrepancy might seem counter - intuitive given that the drives use the very same platters .
However , the fastest area of the disk is the outer edge of the platter ; the 2TB drive has twice the platters of the 1TB model and thus double the outer - edge area .
Although the new terabyte Black may not have the platter count or dual - stage actuator to challenge for the performance crown , it does have an ace up its sleeve with support for a 6 G bps Serial ATA interface .
Well , maybe it ’s more of a joker .
The fact is that the drive ’s 126MB / s maximum sustained transfer rate is n’t even fast enough to saturate a gen - one 150 MB /s SATA link , let alone the second - gen 300 MB /s SATA ports present in most modern systems .
Only short burst transfers from the Black ’s DRAM cache memory stand to benefit from the drive ’s faster host interface .
That cache does weigh in at 64MB , which is a lot for a mechanical hard drive .
However , 6 Gbps SATA support did n’t do much for Seagate ’s Barracuda XT , which also has a beefy 64MB cache , so we do n’t expect much better from the Black .
I ’d expect retailers to trumpet the Caviar ’s new - fangled SATA support from the rooftops , so it should n’t be difficult to differentiate the drive from the old three - platter , 3 Gbps Caviar Black 1TB .
You can also tell the two apart based on their model numbers : the old Black is the WD1001FALS , while the new drive carries a WD1002FAEX model designation .
Like other members of the Caviar Black family , Western Digital ’s latest is covered by a five - year warranty .
Most desktop hard drives offer three - year warranties , which is yet another reason we ’ve been recommending the Black for all this time .
A longer warranty does n’t necessarily guarantee your drive will last , of course , but if it fails , at least you ’ll be guaranteed a free replacement for longer .
Our test methods
Today , we ’ll be looking at the Caviar Black 1TB ’s performance against its most natural rival : the two - platter , 1TB Seagate Barracuda 7200.12 .
Samsung and Hitachi also make two - platter drives with terabyte capacities , and while we ’ll be covering both soon , they ’ve yet to arrive in our labs .
In addition to letting the Black square off against a terabyte ‘ cuda , we ’ve thrown a couple of flagship 2TB drives from WD and Seagate into the mix .
The Caviar Black 2TB uses the same platters as the 1TB model and has that fancy dual - stage actuator , but it only supports 3 Gbps SATA .
Seagate ’s Barracuda XT 2TB has a 6 Gbps SATA port and uses the same 500GB platters as the 7200.12 .
All four drives were tested on the 3 Gbps SATA controller inside Intel ’s P55 Express PCH .
Since they both support third - gen Serial ATA , the Caviar Black 1TB and Barracuda XT 2TB were also tested on Marvell ’s 9123 SATA 6 Gbps controller with the company ’s 1.0.0.1027 drivers .
The Marvell controller puts two 600 MB/s SATA ports behind a single PCIe 2.0 link that offers 500MB/s of bidirectional bandwidth , so it ’s not an ideal implementation .
However , the 9123 is the only SATA 6 Gbps controller currently on the market , and it should be plenty fast for our purposes today .
Neither the Barracuda XT nor the Caviar Black is capable of fully exploiting a 600 MB/s SATA link .
We used the following system configuration for testing :
Our test system was powered by an OCZ GameXStream power supply unit .
With the exception of our power consumption and noise levels , all tests were run at least twice , with the results averaged .
We used the following versions of our test applications :
The test systems ’
Windows desktop was set at 1280 × 1024 in 32 - bit color at an 85 Hz screen refresh rate .
Vertical refresh sync ( vsync ) was disabled for all tests .
All the tests and methods we employed are publicly available and reproducible .
If you have questions about our methods , hit our forums to talk with us about them .
WorldBench
WorldBench uses scripting to step through a series of tasks in common Windows applications .
It then produces an overall score .
WorldBench also spits out individual results for its component application tests , allowing us to compare performance in each .
We ’ll look at the overall score , and then we ’ll show individual application results .
The 1TB Black ties the WorldBench overall score of its 2TB Caviar counterpart when the two are connected to the Intel storage controller .
However , the terabyte drive scores one point higher when it ’s paired with the 6 Gbps Marvell controller .
We ’re only looking at a two - point spread between the fastest and the slowest drives , so do n’t get too excited about 6 G bps SATA just yet .
Most of WorldBench ’s multimedia editing and encoding tests offer equivalent performance with the drives we ’re looking at today .
The Photoshop test does run notably quicker on the Caviars , though .
The 2TB drive is a hair faster , but the terabyte model has a decent lead over the rest of the field , at least when connected to the Intel storage controller .
When paired with the Marvell controller , the Caviar ’s performance slows by about 7 % .
The terabyte Black proves a little quicker in WorldBench ’s Office test , but it ’s trailed closely by the Barracuda XT .
Scores from the web browsing and multitasking tests are too tight to call .
While there ’s little difference in WinZip performance between the drives , WorldBench ’s Nero test produces some interesting results .
The Caviar Black 1TB is quite a bit quicker with the Marvell controller this time around , yet it ’s barely slower than the 7200.12 when both are connected to the Intel chipset .
Boot and load times
To test system boot and game level load times , we busted out our trusty stopwatch .
The terabyte Black is the slowest drive to boot by a couple of seconds .
It ’s only about a second slower than the 7200.12 , though .
Do n’t pay too much attention to the Marvell scores here .
The 88SE9123 appears to be in no hurry to initialize drives , which is why the Barracuda XT and Caviar Black are both slower than when connected to the Intel PCH .
Call of Duty 4 level load times do n’t vary much from one drive to the next .
Load times in Far Cry 2 are close , as well , with just over half a second separating the fastest configuration from the slowest one .
File Copy Test
File Copy
Test is a pseudo - real - world benchmark that times how long it takes to create , read , and copy files in various test patterns .
We ’ve converted those completion times to MB/s to make the results easier to interpret .
Vista ’s intelligent caching schemes make obtaining consistent and repeatable performance results rather difficult with FC - Test .
To get reliable results , we had to drop back to an older 0.3 revision of the application and create or own custom test patterns .
During our initial testing , we noticed that larger test patterns tended to generate more consistent file creation , read , and copy times .
That makes sense , because with 4GB of system memory , our test rig has plenty of free RAM available to be filled by Vista ’s caching and pre-fetching mojo .
For our tests , we created custom MP3 , video , and program files test patterns weighing in at roughly 10 GB each .
The MP3 test pattern was created from a chunk of my own archive of ultra-high - quality MP3s , while the video test pattern was built from a mix of video files ranging from 360 MB to 1.4GB in size .
The program files test pattern was derived from , you guessed it , the contents of our test system ’s Program Files directory .
Even with these changes , we noticed obviously erroneous results pop up every so often .
Additional test runs were performed to replace those scores .
The Caviar Black 1TB fares well in this batch of file creation workloads , besting the 7200.12 with each test pattern .
Only the video test pattern really seems to benefit from switching to the Marvell controller , at least with the Caviar the Barracuda XT is much faster when connected to the Marvell than it is when running on the Intel chipset .
As you can see , the 2TB Caviar Black is measurably faster than the terabyte model across all three test patterns .
With a sequential task like file creation , I suspect we ’re seeing the 2TB drive ’s greater outer - edge area at work .
Again , the terabyte Black pulls up short of its 2TB counterpart .
However , the Caviar is still faster than the 7200.12 with the program files and video test patterns .
Do be wary of the Marvell controller , though .
While the terabyte Black is quicker in 6 G bps mode with the MP3 test pattern , it ’s actually slower with the other two .
Our copy tests combine read and write operations , and they prove a little problematic for the terabyte Caviar , which lags behind the 7200.12 with two test patterns and ties it with the third .
Fire up the Marvell controller , and the Black ’s performance improves slightly to eclipse that of the 7200.12 .
IOMeter
IOMeter presents a good test case for both seek times and command queuing .
Western Digital drives have long offered the best performance with our IOMeter workloads , and the terabyte Black is no exception .
Interestingly , the drive ’s a little slower than the 2TB model .
I would n’t expect outer - edge area to make much of a difference with the random access patterns of our IOMeter workloads , but perhaps we ’re seeing the 2TB Black ’s second actuator stage coming into play here .
Even though it trails the 2TB Black , the terabyte model still offers much higher transaction rates than either Barracuda .
Notice also that , on the Marvell controler , the Caviar and Barracuda XT run into a performance bottleneck when the load increases beyond 32 concurrent I /O requests .
When connected to the Intel controller , both drives continue to ramp up transaction rates all the way to 256 I/O requests .
Nothing to see here , folks .
IOMeter uses a tiny fraction of our test system ’s CPU resources with each drive .
HD Tach
We tested HD Tach with the benchmark ’s full variable zone size setting .
Areal density matters , folks .
The Caviars ’ platters offer 53 more gigabits per square inch than those inside the Barracudas , and that translates to faster sequential transfer rates in this HD Tach drag race .
The terabyte Black is 3 - 4MB /s quicker than the 7200.12 here .
3800 MB/s from a third - gen SATA interface that ’s supposed to top out at 600 MB/s ?
Something ’s fishy here , and it turns out the culprit is Marvell ’s drivers , which carve out a slice of system memory to use as a drive cache .
So let ’s ignore those results and focus on the Intel controller , which has the terabyte Black out ahead of the 7200.12 by 9MB /s in HD Tach ’s burst speed test .
Oddly , the Black 1TB is 10 MB / s slower than the 2TB drive , despite the fact that both use a 64MB cache .
As has become tradition , the Caviars register much quicker random access times than their Barracuda rivals .
You ’re looking at a difference of two - and - a - half milliseconds between the terabyte Black and 7200.12 .
That margin might not sound like much , but keep in mind we ’re working with in the multi-GHz confines of a modern PC .
In that sort of environment , milliseconds matter .
I do n’t want to make too much of the 0.2 - millisecond difference between the terabyte and 2TB Caviar Blacks here .
However , I ca n’t help but wonder if this is another indication of the performance penalty associated with the terabyte drive ’s lack of a dual - stage actuator .
Our CPU utilization results are within HD Tach ’s +/- 2 % margin of error for this test .
Noise levels
Noise levels were measured with a TES - 52 Digital Sound Level meter 1 ″ from the side of the drives at idle and under an HD Tach seek load .
Drives were run with the PCB facing up .
Our noise level and power consumption tests were both conducted with the drives connected to the P55 rather than the Marvell controller .
Although thankfully not as noisy as the 2TB Black , the terabyte model is a few decibels louder than Seagate ’s Barracudas .
At idle , the difference is n’t noticeable to my ears .
However , the Black definitely chatters louder than the 7200.12 when seeking .
I can easily hear the difference from a few feet away , although I should point out that we ’re running this system on an open test bench rather than inside an enclosure .
Power consumption
For our power consumption tests , we measured the voltage drop across a 0.1 - ohm resistor placed in line with the 5V and 12V lines connected to each drive .
We were able to calculate the power draw from each voltage rail and add them together for the total power draw of the drive .
Drives were tested while idling and under an IOMeter load consisting of 256 outstanding I/O requests using the workstation access pattern .
Surprisingly , the terabyte Black has similar power consumption to the 2TB drive , even with half the number of platters .
The 7200.12 is the most efficient of the bunch , drawing about a watt less than our comparable Caviar .
We 're rapidly closing in on a decade since the first desktop processors cleared the 3GHz mark , but in a stunning break from earlier progress , the clock speed of the top processors has stayed roughly in the same neighborhood since .
Meanwhile , the feature shrinks that have at least added additional processing cores to the hardware are edging up to the limits of photolithography technology .
With that as a backdrop , today 's issue of Science contains a series of perspectives that consider the question of whether it 's time to move beyond semiconductors and , if so , what we might move to .
The basic problem , as presented by IBM research 's Thomas Theis and Paul Solomon , is that scaling the frequency up has required scaling the switching voltage down as transistors shrink .
Once that voltage gets sufficiently small , the difference between on and off states causes problems from some combination of two factors : the off state leaks ( leading to heat and power use problems ) , or the device switches slowly , meaning lower clock speed .
Faced with a " choose any two " among speed , size , and power , we 've been doing pretty well via chipmakers ' focus on the latter two , but that 's now gotten physicists and materials scientists thinking it might be time to look elsewhere .
With four individual perspectives loaded with technical information , it 's not realistically possible to dive into the details of each , so what follows is a top - down overview of some of the arguments that are advanced by the various authors .
Forget clockspeed entirely
It 's not that the authors of this perspective think continued progress in the sort of electronics that appear in laptops is unimportant ; they just suggest it will be increasingly less interesting as we focus on small , flexible systems that can be put in portable devices like smartphones , integrated into things ( like clothing ) that do n't currently contain electronics , and ultimately find their way into implantable medical devices .
For all of these applications , flexing and stretching are more important than raw speed .
We 've covered a variety of approaches to getting bits to bend , and the perspective breaks approaches down into two basic categories : either make the electronics flexible , or make them small , and connect them with flexible material .
In the former category , the obvious choice would be some sort of organic transistor , but the authors suggest that the need for this is overstated .
If standard silicon is fashioned into a silicon ribbon , it 's actually remarkably robust when flexed .
The trick is to embed the ribbon in a stable , flexible substrate , as well as accepting that the device will never have the same power as a complex , multi-layer chip of the sort that we use today .
The alternative is to make the electronics rigid , but extremely small and simple , so that they do n't occupy much space .
These mini-chips can then be embedded in a flexible material without changing its bulk properties .
All that 's left is connecting them up and providing them with power , but a number of materials — metals , silicon , and a carbon - nanotube derivative called " buckypaste " — can provide flexible and bendable wiring .
Both approaches are already working in the lab , and the primary challenges tend to involve integrating materials that have very different properties in terms of hydrophobicity , heat dissipation , etc .
More bang for your volt
The IBM duo mentioned above reason that , if the problem is that we can't switch existing gates well with small voltage changes , it 's time to find a switch that will amplify the impact of a small voltage change .
So they consider two approaches that allow a voltage change to have nonlinear effects .
The first is something called " interband tunnel FET . "
In the on state , electrons have easy access to a valence band they can tunnel into .
A small change in voltage , however , makes this valence band inaccessible , creating a sharp , and leakage - proof off state .
The problem with this approach is that , right now , we can make these devices with carbon nanotubes , but not silicon .
The alternative is to create some sort of gain device into the circuitry that amplifies a small input voltage .
A sandwich of ferroelectric and dielectric layers will apparently allow the ferroelectric layer to switch its bulk behavior between two polarization states , giving a small voltage input an all - or - nothing impact .
Adding these devices would obviously increase the size of a gate but , at the moment , the real problem is switching speed : theoretically , these things could switch in less than a picosecond , but actual implementations are taking 70 to 90ps .
Forget silicon entirely
The remaining two perspectives focus on the promise of transition metal oxides .
The unusual electronic properties of these materials were made famous via high temperature superconductivity , but it 's a very diverse group of materials with a huge range of properties .
Bonds between oxygen and metals like titanium and lanthanum are extremely ionic in nature , which brings the large , electron - rich d-orbitals of the metals to the fore .
Depending on the precise structure of the material and the additional metals present ( Zn , Mg , and Sr appear common ) , the large collection of d-orbital electrons act as a bulk material .
And , just like any bulk material , the electrons can have phases , including solids , liquids , gasses , superfluids , and liquid crystals ; there are also property - based phases , like spin- and orbital - liquids .
Where there are phases , there are phase transitions , which can be induced by electric and magnetic fields , among other factors .
So , the potential is there for a small input to have a significant impact on a large collection of electrons .
So far , the first demonstrations of this have come in the form of different types of RAM based on ferroelectric , magnetic , and resistance .
Things get even more interesting when the interfaces between different oxide layers are considered .
We 've covered one report in the past that described how the interface between two transition oxide insulators could allow superconductivity , and a variety of other interesting effects are described here .
Some of these have already been demonstrated to switch states at features below 10nm ; an atomic force microscope has created conducting lines at 2nm resolution in a different material .
A decade or more ago , the problem with these materials was having any control over their formation , but we 've now gained the ability to deposit layers of the stuff with precisions of a single unit cell of the crystal .
The roadblock now is theory ; as one perspective puts it , the large numbers of electrons present create a many - body problem that we can't really solve .
More generally , there are a lot of transition metals , and a lot of complex oxide combinations ( LaAlO 3 - SrTiO 3 and La 2/3 Ca 1/3 MnO 3 are just two of the many combinations mentioned ) .
Right now , theory simply has n't reached the point where we can accurately model the effect of bringing these materials together , which makes designing anything with specific properties very hit - or - miss .
The overall message is that we 're a long way from seeing anything resembling these ideas in a device , with the possible exception of bendable circuitry .
For the moment , this has n't been a crisis , as the fab - makers have managed to stretch out photolithography , and multicore processors are being put to reasonably good use .
Still , the payoff from additional cores is likely to shrink fast , and it 's nice to think that there may be something on the horizon that could restart a MegaHertz race .

By Janelle Weaver
Removing part of the brain can induce inner peace , according to researchers from Italy .
Their study provides the strongest evidence to date that spiritual thinking arises in , or is limited by , specific brain areas .
To investigate the neural basis of spirituality , Cosimo Urgesi , a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Udine , and his colleagues turned to people with brain tumours to assess the feeling before and after surgery .
Three to seven days after the removal of tumours from the posterior part of the brain , in the parietal cortex , patients reported feeling a greater sense of self - transcendence .
This was not the case for patients with tumours removed from the frontal regions of the brain .
" Self - transcendence used to be considered just by philosophers and crank new age people , " says co-author Salvatore Aglioti , a cognitive neuroscientist at the Sapienza University of Rome .
" This is the first really close - up study on spirituality .
We 're dealing with a complex phenomenon that 's close to the essence of being human . "
The authors pinpointed two parts of the brain that , when damaged , led to increases in spirituality : the left inferior parietal lobe and the right angular gyrus .
These areas at the back of the brain are involved in how we perceive our bodies in spatial relation to the external world .
The authors of the study in the journal Neuron1 , say that their findings support the connection between mystic experiences and feeling detached from the body .
" The most surprising part was the rapidity of the change , " says Urgesi .
" This discovery shows that some complex personality traits are more malleable than previously thought . "
The science of spirituality
The researchers interviewed 88 people with brain tumours of various severities .
Twenty of these people had benign tumours and although they underwent surgery no tissue was removed .
All 88 people participated in interviews about their religious habits and beliefs before surgery and afterwards answered a series of true or false questions that assessed spirituality .
The questionnaire tapped into three main components of self - transcendence : losing yourself in the moment , feeling connected to other people and nature , and believing in a higher power .
Examples of the items on the questionnaire include : " I often become so fascinated with what I 'm doing that I get lost in the moment - like I 'm detached from time and place " and " I sometimes feel so connected to nature that everything seems to be part of one living organism . "
The researchers then mapped the precise areas of the patients ' brains where they had lesions as a result of surgery .
Previous studies have shown that a broad network of frontal and parietal brain regions underlies religious beliefs 2,3,4,5 .
But spirituality does not seem to involve exactly the same regions of the brain as religion .
In the past , neurologists have observed spiritual changes in patients with brain damage , but it is not something they systematically evaluate .
" We usually stay away from it , not because it 's not an important topic , but because it 's very private and personal , " says Rik Vandenberghe , a neurologist at the University Hospital Gasthuisberg in Leuven , Belgium .
" This paper is very interesting , but like many pioneering studies , it leaves open many questions . "
Vandenberghe , who uses a similar lesion - mapping technique , says the data should be interpreted with caution .
" It 's very unlikely that something like self - transcendence is localizable to just two brain areas , " he says .
Coarse measure
Probably the most worrisome aspect of the study is the way the authors measured self - transcendence .
" It 's important to recognize that the whole study is based on changes in one self - report measure , which is a coarse measure that includes some strange items , " says cognitive neuroscientist Richard Davidson of the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
" In the future , it will be important to understand why lesions in the parietal cortex induce changes on this scale . "
" Self - transcendence is an abstract concept , and different people will attribute different meanings to the word , " says Vandenberghe .
Patient self reporting is not always accurate , he says , adding that tapping into spirituality with more rigorous behavioural measures and pinpointing the specific thoughts and feelings that constitute it are the obvious next steps .
In future studies , Urgesi would like to measure other aspects of spirituality and determine how long changes in spirituality last in patients .
He 'd also like to inactivate parietal regions in healthy subjects using transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , a non-invasive technique that temporarily changes neural activity in a specific region , to see if he can induce immediate changes in self - transcendence .
He envisions a day when TMS can be used to increase the feeling of self - transcendence in people with neurological or psychological disorders .
If I had to bet all my savings on one stock , I would bet on this one !
Now that I have your attention , never ever do that !
That ’s some terrible advice !
Betting your savings on one company is never a wise investment strategy .
Diversification is the key .
Spread your risk .
Think Enron , AIG , GM .. , in case you ’ve been living under a rock , they all tanked !
But to make up an interesting read , let ’s say I had to pick one and only one stock , I have one such stock in mind .
First , let ’s look at the numbers .
Opinions are passe .

Those are some impressive numbers .
There are n’t too many companies that can boast such returns and if you are an informed investor , you probably know which company I ’m talking about .
Berkshire Hathaway .
This company is run by the most modest man in the world – Warren Buffett .
It is hard to find a more humble person who happens to be one of the richest in the world .
He still lives in a house in Omaha , he purchased for $ 31,500 .
What does Berkshire Hathaway do ?
Berkshire Hathaway is more similar to an actively managed mutual fund company than a traditional one .
Berkshire is a holding company of a variety of companies handpicked by Buffett and his partner Charles Munger .
Yet , unlike mutual companies , Berkshire Hathaway buys up so much stock in a company that they have a say in all strategic decisions the company makes .
Buffett can influence the direction a company takes which is not true with mutual fund managers .
What ’s Wall Street ’s opinion on Berkshire Hathaway ?
According to Bloomberg , bond investors consider Berkshire Hathaway notes safer than US government bonds !
That ’s like saying they have more faith in Berkshire Hathaway than the US government on a loan default !
So what ’s the catch ?
For one , the top 2 people who run Berkshire Hathaway are aging .
Buffet is 79 , Munger is 86 .
Berkshire Hathaway is huge .
It may not be able to give the same returns investors are used to
If you like to bet on technology stocks , Berkshire Hathaway is a bad choice .
Buffett is known for his aversion to tech stocks
The current market can trip even the best of managers
The price on 1 share of BRK .
A is $ 121,987 !
And will most likely never split .
( You still can get in on the gravy train by getting its sibling brk .b which trades at around $ 82 )
If Buffett became the world ’s third richest man working the market , he knows something that others do n’t .
I would pick Buffett over any other money manager considering Buffett ’s performance record .

That ’s the total for the committee ’s closed - door event with the Fox News host tonight .
Okay , so you might be thinking that beer and caramel go together about as well as beer and ice cream — PBR float , anyone ? — but these Beer & Pretzel Caramels ( $ 12/ dozen ) are a happy exception .
Made by Liddabit Sweets in Brooklyn , these tiny treats are made by reducing and mixing Brooklyn Brewery 's Brown Ale and East India Pale
Ale into caramel , accompanied by chunks of salty Martin 's pretzels for added crunch and texture .
DUBLIN , Ireland — Scene : the dining room of the American ambassador ’s residence in Phoenix Park , Dublin , one afternoon in 2004 .
The ambassador , James C. Kenny , a fundraiser for President George W. Bush , chats pleasantly with the Irish president Mary McAleese and her dentist husband Martin ( who also happen to be his neighbors ) , as well as a third lunch guest with a strong working class Belfast accent .
This guest is Jackie McDonald , self - styled brigadier of the loyalist paramilitary organization , the Ulster Defence Association ( UDA ) , classified as a terrorist group in the United Kingdom .
“ I said to the ambassador , ‘ This is a beautiful meal , the only meal I ever got from the Americans , ’ ” recalls McDonald , who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1989 for blackmail , extortion and threats to kill , but at the time of the lunch was seeking a political way forward .
“ Gerry Adams gets the same meal and $ 500,000 from the Americans . ”
The ambassador gets the point .
Adams , head of Sinn Fein , Northern Ireland ’s largest nationalist party , is able to raise funds in the United States while the UDA cannot .
McDonald adds , however , with gratitude , “ I ’m sitting here and you are treating us as equals and there ’s Martin over there , a personal friend . ”
As the curtain falls , we can appreciate the lunch 's significance .
It was held on the initiative of Martin McAleese as part of a process of “ opening doors ” for the UDA that is only now being publicly acknowledged .
McAleese is a Catholic dentist who grew up in Protestant east Belfast where his family was burned out by loyalists and forced to flee .
As the spouse of Ireland ’s president , seemingly condemned to a walk - on role at official functions , he decided to reach out quietly to the loyalists in his strife - torn home city .
It was a daring and risky decision .
UDA members had killed hundreds of Catholic civilians in the " Troubles " that claimed more than 3,500 lives in Northern Ireland from 1968 to 1998 .
The first contact came in 2003 when McAleese went to meet McDonald in the Taughmonagh social club , reputed to be UDA ’s Belfast headquarters , and invited him to lunch in Aras an Uachtarain , the president ’s official residence in Dublin .
Sixty - five loyalists , some of them former bombers and gunmen who had been conditioned to regard the Republic as enemy territory , arrived in a bus at the mansion where viceroys once oversaw British rule in Ireland .
“ We did n’t know what to expect , ” said McDonald .
“ Some of us had never been across the border .
We were wondering were we doing the right thing ? ”
They found Mary and Martin McAleese to be Belfast natives like themselves , though from “ the other side , ” and keen to talk about a new future in Ireland where every community would be involved .
“ When we left we were all saying ‘ When are we coming back ? ’ ” said McDonald enthusiastically .
Soon afterward Martin McAleese invited the UDA leader and a few pals to play golf at the prestigious K Club ( which would host the 2006 Ryder Cup ) a half - hour ’s drive outside Dublin .
“ It was a smashing day , " said McDonald , who admits being a very amateur golfer .
“ At lunch in the clubhouse Martin presented me with a check for £ 19,000 ( $ 29,000 ) to build facilities and floodlights for the Dunmurry Young Men ’s Football Club ” in Belfast .
It was the first of several occasions when Martin McAleese would discretely raise funds from business contacts to help deprived loyalist communities in Northern Ireland .
McAleese then brought the UDA leader to meet the then - Irish prime minister , Bertie Ahern , in Dublin in 2007 .
This was a first in divided Ireland .
“ We realized they had n’t got two heads and they realized we had n’t got two heads , ” said McDonald .
The encounter happened against the background of a slow - moving peace movement in Northern Ireland whose iconic Unionist politician , Ian Paisley , had not shaken hands with Ahern up to that point .
This changed when Paisley , leader of the Democratic Unionist Party , came to Dublin shortly afterward and gripped Bertie Ahern ’s hand in a strong gesture of friendship .
McDonald believes the UDA blazed a trail for such ground - breaking moves .
“ We were making it easier for Paisley ; if loyalist paramilitaries could go to Dublin , then so could he . ”
The UDA confirmed in January this year that it had decommissioned all its weapons — following a similar move by the IRA two years earlier — and the media - shy Martin McAleese has finally broken his silence about his terrorist contacts .
He told Irish television last week , “ I never had any feelings of resentment or revenge .
I feel very strongly we really have to make the peace process as inclusive as you can . ”
He admitted to being very nervous at the first meeting in the UDA club .
“ I had no idea what the response would be ! ”
And when McDonald came to Dublin , he was nervous in turn .
There are still occasional violent incidents in Northern Ireland , but with the IRA and the UDA disarmed and on permanent cease - fire , and with the extraordinary friendships that have sprung up across the divide , the prospect of a return to the " Troubles ” is remote .
Martin McAleese , probably the best - liked ( amateur ) politician in Ireland today , is now turning his attention to the new crisis in Ireland , that of soaring unemployment .
At his initiative , President Mary McAleese has just announced an online competition offering cash prizes of € 100,000 ( $ 136,000 ) each and development funds of up to € 500,000 ( $ 678,000 ) for new , innovative projects that will create jobs , with funding coming from private donors .
“ Jobs , that is what most people are concerned about , ” said Martin McAleese .
The other day I had the rather unique opportunity to try five versions of Mikkeller ’s Single Hop IPA .
My home - away - from - home , ChurchKey , obtained all ten of the Single Hop series and , in a testament to true beer - geekery , decided to tap them all on the same day for the ultimate drunken compare and contrast session .
We ’ll get to that in a minute , but first …
A Brief Introduction
Mikkeller is a Danish - based ( but not always Danish - brewed ) one man gypsy operation .
The man behind the name is Mikkel Borg Bjergsø , a one - time homebrewer who turned professional in 2006 with his friend Kristian Klarup Keller .
The Mikkeller is - clearly - a portmanteau of their two names .
Keller departed the brewing world in 2007 , and Bjergsø has kept the brand alive since .
As I mentioned earlier , Mikkeller is a gypsy brewer .
What this means is that there is no Mikkeller Brewery .
There is no facility somewhere in the middle of Denmark that spews forth award - winning and genre - challenging beers .
There is , sadly , no brew house tour or tasting room that you or I can dream of someday attending .
In order to produce his beers , Mikkel relies on using available space in other breweries around Europe and the US .
Without a facility , Mikkeller tends not to have any type of consistently available or perennial beers .
Definitely sticking to his homebrewer roots , Mikkel thrives on experimenting with ingredients , styles , and is in my opinion one of the most innovative brewers in the world today .
Speaking of innovative …
The Style
Single Hop IPA is an ‘ educational ’ series of beers , each highlighting a different variety of hop .
There are ten instances of Single Hop : Amarillo , Cascade , Centennial , Chinook , East Kent Golding , Nelson Sauvin , Nugget , Simcoe , Tomahawk , and Warrior .
Aside from the hops , every recipe is identical in water , malt , and yeast .
Also , to further control the experiment , different amounts of each hop are used in order to keep IBU ’s consistent across the board ( by definition , hop varieties with a higher Alpha Acid percentage will impart a higher IBU level per pound ) .
All of this control really allows the flavor and perceived bitterness ( rather than IBU value ) of each individual hop to stand out .
For more about perceived bitterness , check out this Beervana article .
As an aside , Mikkeller is apparently doing two more of these educational series : one with Yeast and another aged in various liquor barrels .
I ca n’t wait .
The Tasting(s )
Note : I ’m only going to comment on taste here .
All five of the beers I tasted ( and all ten that I saw ) are identical in color and effervescence .
Nice deep copper , a typical pale ale coloring .
Pretty great head retention as well , which is nice for the aroma .
Amarillo
Alpha Acid : 7 - 9 %
Usage : Flavor and Aroma in American style ales
A citrusy , light grapefruit aroma .
Flavor up front is a tempered sugary malt .
Hops have a sharp grassy tinge , followed by bitter grapefruit .
Fairly bright & clean finish , slight astringence on the edges of the tongue .
Very reminiscent of big American IPAs , with a bitter citrus profile , this is a big but accessible beer .
8/10
East Kent Goldings
Alpha Acid : 4 - 6 %
Usage : Flavor , Aroma , and Bittering .
Traditional English ale hop .
Aroma is hay - like .
Big amber malt backbone dominates this beer .
Hops are n’t very agressive .
Very earthy , with a faint allspice and anise background .
Lingering numbing bitterness in the finish .
This does n’t taste like an IPA at all .
More of an English bitter ( logical , since this is where Kent Goldings are most commonly found ) .
An interesting example of what the hop tastes like , but not a good IPA .
After drinking this , it ’s obvious why this hop is used primarily in malt - forward beers , where it provides a welcome contrast to the sweetness .
As a frontman , Kent just does n’t work .
4/10
Nelson Sauvin
Alpha Acid : 12-13 %
Usage : Flavor , Aroma .
Fruity , wine - like New Zealand grown hop
Barnyard , earthy aroma , with a faint bitter acai smell .
Biscuity malt upfront ( it ’s amazing how the same grain bill can present itself so differently in the finished product when offset by a different hop ) .
Bitterness is almost fruity - wild berries and dry white grape juice .
Finish is long and spicy .
Interestingly balanced and delicate , followed by some aggression at the end .
This is by far the most unique hop I ’ve ever tasted .
It ’s absolutely wine - like , very full and rounded .
It only suffers in its drinkability .
I happily put down one glass , but I did n’t want more .
9.3/10
Nugget
Alpha Acid : 11 - 14 %
Usage : Mostly bittering , recently becoming popular for dry - hopping
Aroma is sweet pine .
Malt is very toasty .
Lots of spice in the hop .
It ’s almost sugary over bitter .
Notes of heather & rosemary ( or is it sage ? )
Very reminiscent of a scotch ale more than an IPA .
My notes on this one are a bit hazy ( surely the effect of swilling five consecutive IPAs ) , but I remember enjoying it .
In line with the traditional use of the hop , it tended toward bitter astringency over pungent aromatics found in more popular high acid hops .
7/10
Tomahawk
( aka Columbus )
Alpha Acid : 14 -18 %
Usage : Bittering .
The first US ’ super - alpha ’ hop .
Big hit of spicy evergreen on the nose .
The bitterness really comes out in this one ( which is why I drank it last ) .
From the first sip , it ’s obviously the bitterest of the bunch .
Pungent , piney hop oils totally overwhelm the malt profile .
A big spice follows .
The finish is quickly astringent , but ends surprisingly clean .
For such a big piney hop , the tomahawk is nicely drinkable .
Definitely the most aggressive of the five I ’ve tried , but one of the best tasting .
8.5/10
The Verdict
A very cool experiment , for Mikkeller and for myself .
As a budding homebrewer , I relish the opportunity to really gain some insight into how certain varieties of hops actually effect the final product .
I definitely recommend picking up more than one of these if you can find it .
A few are good on their own , but I think that in order to truly appreciate the depth of the Single Hop IPA , and the brilliance of the philosophy behind it , two , three , five , or ( if you ’re lucky ) all of them need to be stacked up side - by - side .
If this idea catches your fancy , all ten were still on tap at ChurchKey as of last night , and likely will last for another day or two .
If you ’re in the area , I ’d highly recommend cozying up next to a flight .

A US boffin has effectively put the mockers on Star Trek - style warp speed travel to the stars by warning that interstellar hydrogen gas would become deadly to humans as they approached the speed of light .
Professor William Edelstein of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine explained to New Scientist that while interstellar space has just a couple of hydrogen atoms per cubic centimetre , as the crew of the Enterprise hit the gas pedal , a compression effect would greatly increase the number of atoms hitting the spacecraft .
As the spaceship reached 99.999998 per cent of the speed of light , " hydrogen atoms would seem to reach a staggering 7 teraelectron volts " , which for the crew " would be like standing in front of the Large Hadron Collider beam " .
This is a very bad thing , because humans in the path of this ray would receive a dose of ionising radiation of 10,000 sieverts , and as Bones McCoy would doubtless confirm , the lethal dose is 6 sieverts .
The result ?
Death in one second .
The spacecraft 's structure would do little to mitigate the effects of the killer hydrogen .
Edelstein " calculates that a 10 - centimetre - thick layer of aluminium would absorb less than 1 per cent of the energy " , and the intense doses of radiation would damage the ship 's structure and fry its electronics .
Edelstein grimly concluded : " Hydrogen atoms are unavoidable space mines . "
The professor presented his killer calculations to an American Physical Society meeting in Washington DC on Saturday .
Bootnote
Of course , Edelstein 's conclusions are based on current scientific knowledge .
No doubt future spacecraft designers will deploy advanced radiation - resistant alloys and magnetic shielding to protect Federation staff from instant death .
The correlation between an uncontrolled birth growth and poverty was identified in the 18th century when economist and demographer Thomas Robert Malthus introduced his seminal population theory .
Population growth , Malthus said , will always tend to outrun the food supply , and the betterment of humankind is impossible without stern limits on reproduction .
At the time , Malthus ’ interpretation of the danger of overpopulation was deemed controversial , not just among religious leaders , but also among fellow scientists .
The controversy has still not abated , including in Indonesia , despite its internationally acclaimed success in curbing population growth .
That the government has been stretched to breaking point to promote the family planning program shows not everyone is happy about birth control .
The controversy reportedly set off a political see - saw that eventually resu ...
Tiger Woods ' lawyer is trying to do something Tiger was n't even able to do himself -- keep the golfer 's private parts out of random people 's hands .
TMZ has obtained
Tiger 's lawyer sent to Pipedream Products -- the company that is selling a line of Tiger sex toys ... including blow - up
Tiger sex dolls , giant condoms and a number of filthy items we wo n't even try to describe .
In the letter , Tiger 's lawyer demands Pipedream stop selling the porno products , recall all items that have already been distributed and then destroy or dispose them " in a manner and at a time as directed by Tiger Woods . "
The photos above are from a XXX store in L.A. where the dirty goods are already being sold .
A rep for Pipedream had no comment .
Who here ’s hanging out for The Matty Johns Show ?
The former rugby league star ’s new television vehicle " kicks off " at 7:30 pm next Thursday 25 March on Channel Seven .
The network is promising " a family - friendly mix of sporting stars , special guests , live performances , music and comedy " .
It ’s an oddly retrogressive prospect , harking back to the Hey Heyday of Aussie light entertainment .
The jewels in Johns ’s comedic crown will be gardening guru Don Kirk ( a character based on Don Burke , whose 17 - year - old show was finally euthanased in 2004 ) and explorer Alby Sandals ( that ’d be Alby Mangels , who ’s hardly been seen since the late ’ 80s ) .
To add to the pervading retro flavour , Johns is apparently already feeling the pressure from the network " to produce high - quality improvised comedy in the style of Paul Hogan " .
Leaving aside the conflation of " high quality " and " Paul Hogan " , Hoges ’s show ran from 1973 to 1984 .
Luckily for Johns , few media observers are revisiting his own just bygone era .
Less than a year ago , Johns lost his Footy Show hosting gig at Channel Nine over allegations on the ABC ’s Four Corners that he and his teammates had coerced a drunk 19 - year - old girl into group sex on a preseason tour in 2002 .
" His humour is absolutely incongruous with the revelations in the Four Corners report , " wrote The Australian ‘s Amanda Meade at the time .
" At best he may be acceptable as a rugby league commentator — but even that depends on his being rehabilitated in the audience ’s eyes . "
As is usual for disgraced celebrities , Johns promptly grovelled for forgiveness — winning Tracy Grimshaw a Walkley Award for her interview with him along the way — but appeared much more concerned about his wife and family than about " Clare " , the woman whose predicament , in Grimshaw ’s words , " redefined consent " .
Now he ’s back , the jolly comedian whose antics the whole family can enjoy .
Yet nobody seems to be asking whether someone whose callousness drove a teenager to the point of suicide ought to be hosting a family show .
Is this what public rehabilitation looks like ?
And can his mates watch , too ?
Meanwhile , the media are persecuting Lara Bingle in the tawdriest way over what is arguably a much lesser offence : an episode of infidelity which took place three years ago — and her willingness to accept money now to talk about it .
As Jonathan Holmes pointed out in this week ’s Media Watch , the Bingle frenzy reflects poorly on everyone concerned .
Why do the media refuse to forgive celebrities like Bingle , while others , like Matthew Johns , get their slates wiped clean ?
On what grounds do we let bygones be bygones ?
Sydney Morning Herald league commentator Roy Masters suggested that in sports TV , " credibility takes a back seat to likeability " .
Johns comes across as humble and personable , says Masters , whereas Lara Bingle and Brendan Fevola are " the balls of hot gas around whom the media world turns " .
So , perhaps Bingle is being punished for craving the spotlight — and Fevola for once again stumbling into it — whereas Johns is rewarded for being quiet and dignified ( qualities that surely will not last long into the first episode of The Matty Johns Show ) .
But if that ’s true , then how come actress Winona Ryder will always be dogged by the stigma of shoplifting , despite taking five years off work after being convicted in 2002 ?
She did her community service , paid her fines , and only spoke publicly about her crime in 2007 … yet she ca n’t escape those " sticky - fingered " jokes .
It did n’t help when in 2008 , the National Enquirer alleged that Ryder had set off a pharmacy ’s security alarm by leaving with make - up for which she had n’t paid .
No — there ’s more to celebrity reputation management than public modesty and contrition .
There ’s also a gender dimension to our willingness to dredge up the " chequered past " .
We continue to judge female celebrities on years ’ worth of their private behaviour — and we judge them more harshly than men .
Britney Spears is regularly criticised for being fat and slovenly , a weak singer and poor live performer , a bad parent to her sons and so mentally unstable she ’s unable to manage her own life and thus is manipulated , puppet - like , by a circle of avaricious enablers .
Spears has made many attempts to relaunch her career since her 2006 meltdown , and earned critical respect for her cameo appearances on How I Met Your Mother and her 2009 album Circus .
Yet at the age of 28 , she ’s seemingly more interesting to the public as a ruin of a pop star and of a human being .
Similarly , when Heather Mills married former Beatle Paul McCartney in 2002 , she was well - known as a committed vegetarian and charity campaigner .
However , the media just could n’t seem to get over the fact that Mills was once a nude model and is now an amputee .
In her acrimonious divorce from McCartney in 2008 , her past was raked over : nude photos ; accusations of compulsive lying .
Her claim for a sizeable chunk of McCartney ’s fortune saw her widely pilloried as a " gold - digger " , and her willingness to make dramatic public statements meant her charity work was no longer taken seriously .
When she argued that giving up cow ’s milk was an environmentally friendly act , her comments were reported thusly : " Drink rats ’ milk , says Heather Mills " .
Things get more troubling , however , when male celebrities get caught in degrading treatment of women .
Actor Charlie
Sheen can allegedly hold a knife to his wife ’s throat and threaten to kill her — and keep his starring role in a hugely popular sitcom about a single dad .
Alec Baldwin can win Emmy Awards for his own sitcom work — with a reputation for a temper so vicious he berated his own 11 - year - old daughter as a " rude , thoughtless little pig " .
Worst of all , director Roman Polanski can flee sentencing after being convicted of raping a 13 - year - old girl , yet continue to produce critically acclaimed work for 32 years .
When he was finally arrested last September , more than 100 of his peers , including Woody Allen , Martin Scorsese , Pedro Almodovar and David Lynch , signed a petition urging his release in which they called the vicious rape " a case of morals " .
Closer to home , Australian actor / director Matthew Newton pled guilty in 2007 to assaulting his then - girlfriend Brooke Satchwell in 2006 .
He not only rebounded to star on Underbelly , but also subsequently had his conviction quashed on the grounds that he was mentally ill at the time .
Part of what cut Newton loose were the 17 gleaming personal references from family and friends — themselves high - profile entertainment industry figures .
The presiding judge also noted that " the way in which he has been given particular media attention has acted as a considerable measure of punishment " .
Clearly the media have not been quite punitive enough , for every now and then Newton ’s bad - boy antics continue to make headlines .
But last August , Newton vehemently insisted that bygones remain bygones .
In an interview on the Today Show to promote his directorial debut , Three Blind Mice , Lisa Wilkinson brought up the Satchwell incident , and Newton flatly said he did n’t want to talk about it , saying it " has nothing to do with who I actually am " .
When Wilkinson pressed him on the matter , Newton bristled .
" I think it would be like me asking you about your wedding night — it ’s personal .
It ’s my life , my business , and certainly not what I ’m here to discuss . "
Bringing up a wedding night in the context of violence against women was a truly sinister move .
Why ?
Because they are two absolutely different things .
The commission of a crime to which " Australia says no " needs to be publicly condemned — or at least acknowledged — rather than consigned to a never - discussed past .
Just last weekend , Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Sir Ken Jones told the Sunday Age that our community ’s tolerance of domestic violence contributes to a wider culture of violence .
Last year there were 181 homicides in Victoria — more than in any other state .
I ’m not suggesting that Matthews Newton and Johns are promulgating a culture of violence , nor that they must exist in a perpetual , public state of shame and have their careers permanently ruined by their past actions .
But it is abhorrent that these men can " put the past behind them " while the women they have treated so contemptuously — and famous women in general — are n’t granted that same luxury .
Showcasing the hottest babes in sport - these girls do n't just play great , they look great .

What if we achieved the urbanist dream , with people deciding en masse to move back to the city ?
Well , that would create a big problem , since there would be no place to put them .
Many cities hit their peak population in 1950 , when the US total was 150 million .
Today it is over 300 million , with virtually all the growth taking place in the suburbs .
So where would these new urbanites reside ?
With the enormous losses in our urban housing stock , our cities lack the residences to hold even their 1950 population .
A recent survey found that one third of all the lots in Detroit are now vacant , for example .
And even if all the old housing was rebuilt , declines in household sizes , particularly in urban areas , has reduced the effective carrying capacity of the old urban fabric even at historic densities .
But there 's an even bigger challenge to wholesale urbanization from future population growth .
The Census Bureau estimates that the US will add nearly 100 million more new people by 2050 .
If you look at the few cities in the country that have large inhabited urban cores , they hold a relatively small percentage of the current population .
New York City , Los Angeles , Chicago , Philadelphia , San Francisco , Boston , Seattle and Washington , DC combined barely hold 20 million people .
Even if all these cities doubled in population by 2050 , they would only be able to hold 20 % of the net new growth expected over the next four decades .
And achieving even that level of urban growth is simply not realistic .
Most of the existing highly urbanized cities are already largely full of buildings .
Even where land is available , zoning restricts what can be built there , and increasing densities is politically difficult .
New York City has been the most aggressive on the growth front , rezoning 20 % of the city under the Bloomberg administration , although many sections have actually been downzoned .
But even this effort could accommodate a projected one million new residents by 2030 .
Chicago is going the other direction .
When it introduced new zoning under the Daley administration , permitted densities were actually reduced in most cases , though Chicago remains perhaps the only truly urban city with large amount of vacant or underutilized land for redevelopment .
Ed Glaeser calls for building skyscrapers in California , but San Francisco residents are imbued with a strong anti-development mindset and have long railed against the “ Manhattanization ” of their city .
America could not be reshaped from a primarily suburban to a city - centric country without a massive shift in local political mind - sets .
Rather than attempting that exercise in futility , urban advocates should adopt much more modest goals that , although limited , could be completely transformational for our cities .
There 's been much made of the return to the city .
Indeed , large tracts of the urban cores of many places have been utterly remade .
But most of the cities where this has happened have been America 's largest tier one cities – New York , Chicago , Boston , etc .
They have achieved the point of self - sustaining urban growth , and are well positioned to attract more residents , particularly the upscale and childless , young singles and students and recent immigrants .
In contrast , smaller cities have seen a few hundred downtown condos and such , but not a real urban renaissance .
There is still a lot of work to do in those places .
The way to do this is to adopt the “ 10 percent solution ” .
That is , for most cities , they should develop a strategy that tries to capture somewhere between 5 and 15 percent of the net new growth in their metro areas .
If a city can get more , great .
But for any growing region , even 10 percent would create a dynamic of massive change in the urban core .
Consider Indianapolis , a region with healthy regional growth that is above average but not among the nation 's leaders .
The Indianapolis metro area is adding people at a rate of about 200,000 people per decade .
Center Township , which is the urban core of the city , peaked in population in 1950 at 337,000 people .
Today it is at 167,000 , a decline of 50 % , on par with America 's greatest urban collapses
But what if the urban core managed to capture 10 % of that new growth ?
That 's 20,000 new residents , very easy to physically accommodate within a decade .
What would 20,000 new residents do to central Indianapolis ?
What would it do to the entire dynamic of the city ?
It could be completely transformational .
Such a modest capture of new population would catapult central Indianapolis into one of the absolute top growth areas in the region .
Only one suburb is on track to add that many or more people during the 2000s .
Many other suburbs are considered prosperous and fast growing despite adding only a few thousand people .
Even that limited influx creates a pattern of growth vs. stagnation and decline .
That 's where urban Indianapolis needs to get .
One of the great advantages of targeting 10 % market share in new growth is that it frees the city to pursue a market segmentation strategy .
It does n't have to try to convince vast numbers of suburbanites – the vast majority of whom are likely to stay in place – to make a radical lifestyle change .
Rather , the core can market to specific segments that it is best positioned to attract , and put together the most compelling and differentiated product to attract them .
One potential market is those who want an urban environment but can't afford to live in one of the expensive tier one cities .
They could market themselves to people who find themselves priced out of the biggest cities , but would settle in a smaller , but still vibrant urban environment .
Can Indianapolis do it ?
As with many cities , there is already some evidence that it could .
In the 2000s , decades of population decline came to an end in 2006 , and Center Township started adding an estimated 400 people per year .
The jury is still out on whether the estimates are confirmed by the census count and whether it can be sustained , but it still amounts to 4,000 people per decade , showing that the city is already starting to make progress .
Cincinnati provides another example .
It is a metro growing a bit less than the national average , but still adding people at a rate of about 150,000 per decade .
The city of Cincinnati declined from a peak of 503,998 in 1950 to 333,336 today , a loss of 170,000 people .
Again , if the city captured 100 % of just regional growth , in little more than a decade it would be back to a record high population .
That 's not realistic of course , but 10 % of that total , or 15,000 people , would still make a tremendous impact on the city .
Like Indianapolis , there 's already some sign of an inflection point , as the city population began growing again in the 2000s .
Can this 10 % solution really happen ?
The answer is a resounding Yes , because it is already happening in Atlanta .
Its reputation as a sprawlburg overshadows the fact that it is experiencing one of America 's most impressive urban core booms .
The city of Atlanta has added almost 120,000 new residents since 2000 , an increase of 28 % .
This is a mere 10.5 % of the metro area 's growth during that time – but it has totally changed the city .
Atlanta lost over 100,000 people from its 1970 peak , but is now at an all time high .
Viewed in this realistic light , there is huge reason for optimism about rebuilding the urban cores of even our Rust Belt cities .
Frankly , with the required market share of growth to get there so low , there 's no excuse for not making it happen .
If city leaders can't figure out how to attract even 10 % of the market , they deserve to lose .
If they can do better , great .
And once they 've captured that 10 % base , and restarted a growth pattern , they can figure out how to get more ambitious and expand market share .
For regions with population decline , like Detroit and Cleveland , there 's a different and much more challenging dynamic .
But for cities with even modest regional population growth , there 's all the opportunity in the world to attract new urban residents and completely change the game for their urban cores .

Cape Breton may become a Canadian version of Florida 's historic Cape Canaveral where astronauts and rockets have been launched into outer space for decades .
The Canadian Space Agency is looking at the Nova Scotia island as one of two possible sites to blast small satellites into orbit using an indigenous rocket launch system .
The other possible micro-satellite launch site is Fort Churchill in Manitoba , near Hudson Bay , where hundreds of small research rockets have been launched in the past .
An official with the Manitoba government says the province is keen on the idea .
" We have not been approached by anyone about a possible rocket launching site in Churchill , but we would be open to discussing the possibility , " cabinet press secretary Rachel Morgan said in an email .
Eric Dubuc , a CSA engineer , says pre-feasibility studies were done in 2008 and the first indication is it would be possible for Canada to launch its own rockets .
" It would be feasible , but extremely challenging , " he told The Canadian Press .
" During the first two feasibility studies we had to look at launch sites because they have a direct effect on the sizing of the vehicle , its performance and where you can go with the vehicle , " he said .
Dubuc noted that Canada has a " legacy of technology " with the Black Brant , a sounding rocket developed by Winnipeg - based Bristol Aerospace and launched from Fort Churchill .
On its website , the CSA notes that over the years , more than 3,500 suborbital flights have been launched from the site .
During the 1950s , close to 4,500 people -- mostly military personnel and Canadian and U.S. research scientists -- lived and worked in Fort Churchill .
In October 2007 , Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited the community and announced a 10 - year multimillion - dollar plan with Manitoba to improve the Port of Churchill and the Hudson Bay rail line leading to it .
To date , more than $ 17 million has been spent on improvements .
Dubuc said a geographic location in the East -- " something along the lines of Cape Breton " -- has also been looked at .
He also added that different scenarios have been considered , including the possibility of having the rocket moved around from site to site on a mobile system .
The idea of using small rockets to monitor Arctic sovereignty has also been discussed informally .
" The size of the launcher we 're looking at is not around , " Dubuc said .
" It 's not really offered right now by the Americans or the Europeans . "
NASA and the European Space Agency both launch satellites for other countries and Dubuc said all options are being looked at .
" Maybe in some cases it would make more sense to launch with the Americans , " he said .
" In some instances it might make more sense to launch ourselves . "
A Cape Breton location also has the support of a Canadian - American consortium which announced its own plans several years ago to develop a launch pad for space tourism .
Geoff Sheerin , an official with Chicago - based PlanetSpace , said in an email " the Canadian Maritimes are an excellent place to launch rockets . "
But , citing legal reasons , he would not elaborate on the current status of his own company 's project .
PlanetSpace is looking at setting up its space port north of Sydney Mines and has held discussions with Nova Scotia Business Inc. , a provincial business development agency .
But the CSA 's Dubuc cautions that Canada wo n't be launching its own rockets any time soon .
" Usually these programs take between five and 10 years , " he noted .
The Afghan government has stepped away from a total ban on the broadcasting of “ disturbing images ” that was implemented earlier this month .
The move had set off howls among media and rights groups .
The initial censorship law used the decades - old excuse that such images would embolden the enemy .
Many critics say that images of security operations would point up the shortcomings of government forces in dealing with insurgent attacks .

Foreign Minister Stephen Smith says three Australians whose passports were allegedly used by suspected Mossad assassins in Dubai appear to have been the victims of identity fraud .
Dubai police have named 15 new suspects in the assassination of Hamas commander Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , who was found dead in his hotel room last month in what police say was almost certainly an Israeli hit .
Police say three of the suspects travelled to the emirate on Australian passports in the names of Adam Marcus Korman , Joshua Daniel Bruce and Nicole Sandra McCabe .
Speaking after meeting the Israeli ambassador in Canberra today , Mr Smith said the Australian Federal Police would conduct a full investigation into how the passports had been copied or altered .
" At this stage Australian officials have no information to suggest the three Australian passport holders were involved in any way other than as victims of passport or identity fraud , " Mr Smith said .
" The Australian Government condemns in the strongest possible terms the misuse and the abuse of Australian passports . "
Mr Smith said he also told ambassador Yuval Rotem that the Australian Government expected Israeli officials to cooperate " fully and transparently " with the AFP 's investigation .
Earlier Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he was determined to " get to the bottom " of the case .
He told AM that officials had been working on the case through the night and pledged the Government would " not let the matter rest " and that Australia " will not be silent on the matter " .
" If Australian passports are being used or forged by any state , let alone for the purpose of assassination , this is of the deepest concern and we are getting to the bottom of this now , " he said .
" We will not leave a single stone unturned . "
Asked what action the Government may take against Israel , Mr Rudd replied : " Let us establish the facts first . "
The three Australians named will be contacted by the Department of Foreign Affairs .
" This is not just a deep concern for the Australian Government , it must be therefore the deepest concern to any individual associated with this as well , " Mr Rudd said .
' Simply unbelievable '
Mr Korman , 34 , is Australian - born but lives in Tel Aviv where he sells musical instruments .
In an interview with Israeli media he has denied any involvement and says he is the victim of identity theft .
AM tried to contact him , along with a Bruce Daniel who lives near Haifa in Israel 's north , but neither was answering the phone .
But Mr Korman has told Israel 's biggest newspaper Yediot Aharonot that he is shocked over what has happened .
" It 's identity theft .
Simply unbelievable , " he is quoted as saying .
" It 's a violation of human rights to do such a thing .
I have travelled all over the world but never visited Dubai or the United Arab Emirates . "
Mr Korman also told the paper he was perplexed as to how he could fly to Australia again now that he is considered an international suspect .
" I have been frightened and shocked since receiving the news , " he reportedly said .
AM has confirmed that Australian Nicole Sandra McCabe also lives in Israel .
When contacted this morning , her family in Australia said they had no knowledge of her name being linked to the Dubai investigation .
Dubai police have released new information about the movements of the 26 suspects before and after the assassination .
All had apparently travelled to Dubai from one of six European cities or Hong Kong , and each left the country to various destinations , including Hong Kong and Iran , before returning to Europe where they apparently abandoned the fraudulent passports .
Many had also used credit cards issued by the same US bank .
Police also released new vision from the hotel 's security cameras showing the man named as Mr Bruce with one of the French suspects inside the hotel .
The Israeli foreign minister has said there is no proof his country carried out the killing .
From their parents , of course .
Tina Fortune , of Florida , is a divorced mother of three .
We ’ve watched a few of her videos , and we ’ve concluded she is a normal , level - headed person !
She discusses family and parenting with reason and experience , which is actually something worth noting in the context of parents who upload videos of their kids to YouTube , because a good 89 percent of them should have their children taken away .
That positive impression was reinforced here , in a chat with her son Mansir , who thinks the idea of a woman marrying another woman is “ nasty . ”
But Tina does n’t want her son judging other people like that .
She asks where he learned gay relationships are “ nasty . ”
Nowhere in particular , he says ; he just knows .
So it could n’t possibly be from his own mother , right ?
Wrong .
Because Tina , who says “ we love all people and we do n’t judge people , ” also reminds Mansir ( and viewers , in the Chyron ) she wants him to marry a girl .
It ’s the “ not in my backyard mentality . ”
I ’m fine with gays , just so long as my kids are n’t !
That is n’t a message of “ not judging ” ; it ’s a message of “ do n’t be different . ”
Who knows what Mansir , or any little boy or girl , will grow up to be .
But while it ’s commendable to raise children with a “ do n’t judge ” attitude , the whole effort is undermined when you tell your kid “ do n’t be like that . ”
As if they have a choice in the matter .
And yes , we noticed the giant cross in the background .

Sometimes when I ’m driving , I ’ll imagine scenarios that would require me to jump out of my speeding car .
I know I ca n’t be the only one who does this .
I do it mainly to pass time while in traffic , but I think there ’s also a part of me who wants to be prepared if ( in the unlikely instance ) I actually have bail out of a moving vehicle to save my life .
The scenarios that I usually come up with are 1 ) my brakes go out and my car is about to fly off a cliff Thelma and Louise style and 2 ) a criminal organization has put me in the backseat of a car and is transporting me to an abandoned warehouse to beat me with a baseball bat .
In both cases , jumping from a speeding car is probably the best option for survival .
Okay , so my scenarios seem unlikely , but when I lived in Tijuana , two of my friends actually did have to jump from a speeding vehicle .
True story .
After leaving my apartment one night , these two guys got on a calafia , or bus .
Now calafias are pieces of crap .
They ’re essentially school buses from the 1970s painted different colors to correspond with their route .
None of them would pass a vehicle inspection in the U.S. and a lot of the drivers are crackheads .
The area we lived in was super hilly .
As the bus was descending one of these steep , long hills , my friends noticed that while the bus driver was repeatedly stepping on the brake pedal , the bus kept going faster and faster .
The brakes had gone out on the bus .
My friends had two choices .
Stay on the bus and see if they ’d survive the impending crash or jump and take their chances with the pavement .
They decided to jump .
One my buds was a retired Mexican soldier and all around badass .
While my American friend was screaming out the window for somebody to help , my Mexican friend took action .
He went to the driver to see if there was an emergency brake .
There was , but it did n’t work .
So he went to the back of the bus and opened up the emergency door .
“ Vamos a saltar . ”
We ’re going to jump .
He told my American friend to hold his backpack in front of him to help soften the landing a bit and then to jump at an angle towards the shoulder of the road where there was dirt instead of pavement .
His final instruction was to try to land on the shoulder and roll when they hit the ground .
They tried to get the bus driver and the other passenger to join them , but they would n’t leave their seats .
The two men looked down at the black pavement moving underneath them at 50 MPH , took a big breath , and jumped .
They hit the ground hard and rolled for several feet .
Despite landing on soft earth , their clothing was ripped to shreds .
They laid there on the side of the Tijuana road , tattered , but alive .
A few seconds later they heard a horrendous crash .
The bus could n’t make the sharp turn and ended up running into the side of a canyon wall .
The driver and all the other passengers died .
I went to visit them the next day at their place .
They were in surprisingly good condition .
They had some wicked road rash and one of them had to get their head stapled shut .
But that was pretty much it .
No broken bones and no internal bleeding .
They rested for several days and were back to work the following week .
Now , these guys were lucky .
Really lucky .
Not too many people can walk away after jumping out of a speeding car without a broken bone .
In fact , many people have died from jumping from a moving car .
But my friends did some things right that increased their chances of surviving .
How to Jump From a Speeding Car
Note : Jumping from a moving car is a last ditch effort .
Serious injury and death can occur from jumping from a moving vehicle .
Exhaust all other possibilities before you decide to make the leap .
Also , before relying on the information in this article , please read our disclaimer .
Open the door completely .
You do n’t want the door to shut on you while you ’re jumping out .
Jump at an angle away from the vehicle .
Your body will be moving at the same velocity as the car , so when you jump , your body will continue in the direction of the car .
To avoid getting run over by the car you ’re jumping from , jump at an angle in the opposite direction the car is moving .
Try to land in a soft area .
If possible , try to jump towards a soft place on the side of the road like grass and dirt .
Anything is better than pavement .
Avoid obstructions .
Time your jump so you do n’t run run into a light pole or sign post .
Tuck .
Before you hit the ground , tuck your body into a ball .
Bring your chin to your chest and bring your arms and legs close to your body .
This will prevent your brain canister from hitting the ground and spilling its contents on the pavement .
Also , it prepares your body to roll .
Roll .
Hit the ground with your shoulder and roll away from traffic .
Rolling lessens the impact when hitting the ground .
Put on your shades and walk away from the exploding car like a badass .
Just kidding .
That ’s what usually happens in the movies .
In real life , you need to seek immediate medical attention for the bruises , scrapes , and broken bones you ’ll likely have from jumping from a speeding vehicle .
Anybody actually ever have to do this ?
I ’d be interested in hearing your story .

Fortunately for us , Gurewitch did make an appearance in the recent " Strange Tales " series , out this week in a hardcover collection , where he offered his take on Marvel 's superhero characters along with a host of other indie cartoonists like Paul Pope , Peter Bagge , and Michael Kupperman .
Gurewitch 's story concerns the ill - fated love affair between Wolverine and Jean Grey , and the dangers of acting rashly whilst in a berserker rage .
Gurewitch has mentioned that he may have more work on the way with Marvel , and all we can say is more , please .

By studying the hydra , a member of an ancient group of sea creatures that is still flourishing , scientists at UC Santa Barbara have made a discovery in understanding the origins of human vision .
The finding is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , a British journal of biology .
Hydra are simple animals that , along with jellyfish , belong to the phylum cnidaria .
Cnidarians first emerged 600 million years ago .
" We determined which genetic ' gateway , ' or ion channel , in the hydra is involved in light sensitivity , " said senior author Todd H. Oakley , assistant professor in UCSB 's Department of Ecology , Evolution and Marine Biology .
" This is the same gateway that is used in human vision . "
Oakley explained that there are many genes involved in vision , and that there is an ion channel gene responsible for starting the neural impulse of vision .
This gene controls the entrance and exit of ions ; i.e. , it acts as a gateway .
The gene , called opsin , is present in vision among vertebrate animals , and is responsible for a different way of seeing than that of animals like flies .
The vision of insects emerged later than the visual machinery found in hydra and vertebrate animals .
" This work picks up on earlier studies of the hydra in my lab , and continues to challenge the misunderstanding that evolution represents a ladder - like march of progress , with humans at the pinnacle , " said Oakley .
" Instead , it illustrates how all organisms -- humans included -- are a complex mix of ancient and new characteristics . "
David Plachetzki , who received his Ph.D. for work done in the Oakley lab , is the first author .
Plachetzki is now a postdoctoral fellow at UC Davis .
UCSB undergraduate Caitlin R. Fong is the second author of the paper .
Kafka left his papers to Max Brod ( right ) - they then passed to his secretary , Esther Hoffe ( left )
By Katya Adler
BBC News , Jerusalem
Imagine a number of safety deposit boxes , in different banks in different countries .
No -one is quite sure what 's inside them .
Yet private individuals , state bodies and commercial institutions are locked in a seemingly endless legal battle to own their contents .
Sounds like a Kafka novel ?
Well , almost .
Kafka asked for his unpublished manuscripts to be destroyed
This is a struggle between Israel and Germany , between a Jewish refugee family from Prague and Israeli public opinion over a collection of papers that might include unpublished works by the celebrated 20th Century writer Franz Kafka .
Kafka became famous in spite of himself .
Just before he died in 1924 , the young novelist , who suffered from various mental and physical illnesses , entrusted his friend , Max Brod , with a collection of handwritten documents .
He asked him to destroy the unpublished manuscripts after his death .
Brod ignored his friend 's last wishes , allowing the world to enjoy works including The Trial .
Legacy Now , a bitter legal battle is raging in Israel over Kafka 's legacy and Max Brod 's estate .
The twists and turns of the case have become Kafkaesque in themselves .
A 1920s notebook shows that Kafka was studying Hebrew
Like Kafka , Max Brod belonged to the German - speaking Jewish community of Prague .
Brod was an ardent Zionist and when the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia in 1939 , he packed Kafka 's documents in a suitcase and fled to Tel Aviv .
There , he formed a close relationship with his secretary , Esther Hoffe , also a refugee from Prague .
When he died in 1968 , he made her the custodian of his estate , which included Franz Kafka 's papers .
Hoffe 's two daughters , Eva and Ruth , then inherited the collection .
At least , that 's what they thought .
After Max Brod 's death , his secretary had sold a number of Kafka 's manuscripts at auction .
She insisted they were hers to do with what she wished .
Literary treasures
The rest of the papers , possibly including great literary treasures - no - one is quite sure - are locked in safety deposit boxes in Switzerland and in Israel along , it is thought , with money and other private belongings of Esther Hoffe .
Scholars believe the deposit boxes contain unpublished drawings by Kafka .
Maybe even the original manuscript of Kafka 's uncompleted novel , Wedding Preparations in the Country .
But without knowing exactly what is in the collection , attaching a price tag is impossible .
Israel 's national library is now fighting to get the boxes opened .
We have other things to do .
Sorry , but culture is not the first on the list .
In Israel there is no place to keep them ( the Kafka papers ) so well as in Germany
Eva Hoffe
It also wants to secure the Kafka manuscripts sold by Esther Hoffe to the German Literature Archive in Marbach , Germany .
Among them is the novel The Trial .
Public opinion in Israel is pretty much set against the Hoffes .
Some media here have painted them as naïve , others as gold - diggers .
The fact that they want to take Kafka 's papers from Israel , to sell them to Germany of all countries , has incensed many and got tongues wagging .
Tainted memory Eva Hoffe , now 75 years old , told me she was devastated at how her mother 's memory was being tainted and her family 's private life destroyed .
I met her in her lawyer 's quirky office , the book shelves interrupted by fish tanks , in downtown Jerusalem .
She was dressed in black , her face strained .
" It feels to me that people are putting my life on the street .
All this belongs to my private life , " she said .
Ms Hoffe says Max Brod was her mentor , that he taught her everything about music and culture and , most especially , about Franz Kafka .
She says Brod , her father and mother were inseparable .
She denies persistent rumours that her mother and Max Brod were lovers .
A great beauty in her youth , Ms Hoffe now rather shies away from the public eye .
" I 'm not married .
I have no children .
I had only this ( the Kafka / Max Brod papers ) .
I cannot believe how this country is behaving .
It has no right to intrude , " she told me .
But many Jewish Israelis believe they have every right to know the contents of the Hoffes ' safety deposit boxes .
Israelis are looking back to their European and Middle Eastern roots .
Franz Kafka is key .
He belongs to the intellectual map of Israel
Professor Dov Kulka , Hebrew University of Jerusalem While Kafka is revered all over the world and Prague , where he lived and worked , has a Kafka museum , many Israelis view Kafka , as a Jew , as part of Israel 's cultural heritage and want the country to have whatever it can of him .
Also formerly from Prague , Dov Kulka is a professor of Jewish history at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University .
He guides me around his study , crammed with Kafka 's photos and diaries .
Professor Kulka assured me that Kafka is very popular in Israel among young and old alike .
His novels are on the school curriculum , his writings are constantly adapted into plays here and every couple of years , he says , new translations of Kafka 's works appear in Israel 's bookshops .
Professor Kulka explains that Israeli Jews are fascinated by Kafka because they have lost their cultural identity - in part through the Holocaust , in part , he says , through Israel 's single - minded nationalist drive in the country 's early years .
Esther Hoffe : Her daughter Eva denies rumours of an affair with Brod " So , " said the professor , " Israelis are looking back to their European and Middle Eastern roots .
Franz Kafka is key .
He belongs to the intellectual map of Israel . "
Along with a number of other Israeli academics , Professor Kulka has written an open letter , insisting that Kafka 's papers and Max Brod 's estate belong in Israel , not Germany .
But Eva Hoffe insists that Israeli libraries are not equipped to care for precious manuscripts .
She says Israel is still busy fighting for its survival and has other priorities .
" We have other things to do .
We have terror , the fight for survival .
Sorry , but culture is not the first on the list .
In Israel there is no place to keep them ( the papers ) so well as in Germany , in Marbach . "
She adds that Israelis do n't seem to care too much about Kafka .
" Here , there 's no street , no public building named after him , " she said .
' Rightful home ' Israel 's national library vehemently disputes this .
It is leading the legal - and to a certain extent , the public relations - battle against the Hoffe sisters .
Like the majority of buildings in Israel , the national library is starkly modern , unapologetically purpose - built .
But it houses great historical treasures .
Meir Heller is the library 's sharply dressed lawyer .
He insists Israel is the rightful home of the works of all great Jewish scholars .
He points to the Albert Einstein archive at the library and instructs one of the librarians to fetch a notebook of Kafka 's from the library safe .
Eva Hoffe with her father ( left ) and Max Brod ( right ) I am allowed to approach with care - and a pair of gloves - to study it .
The notebook dates back to the early 1920s .
Many Israelis use it as proof that Kafka would have wanted his works to end up in Israel .
The yellowing pages , covered in ink scribbles , show Kafka was studying Hebrew .
While the writer was not formally involved in Jewish life in Prague , he certainly showed a great interest in Jewish culture and spirituality .
Meir Heller insists Kafka 's diaries are evidence that the writer 's dream was to come and live in Israel , which was then Palestine .
" He had a dream of coming to Tel Aviv and opening up a restaurant .
He wanted to be a waiter .
Kafka was no ordinary fellow . "
None of the disparate players in this modern - day , confusing , compelling tale would deny that .
Sardonic , melancholic Kafka is probably smiling , wryly , in his grave .

Paul Drinkwater / NBC
When and where will the world next see Conan O’Brien ?
It ’s not certain yet but it will almost surely be on stage , and maybe all over the world .
Representatives of Mr. O’Brien , the former host of “ The Tonight Show ” on NBC , confirmed Friday that plans were in the works to book what is being called “ a revue ” starring Mr. O’Brien in theaters in major cities from California to New York , and perhaps parts further east and west — and maybe north .
With his separation deal from NBC preventing Mr. O’Brien from appearing anywhere on television until after Sept. 1 , the comedian ’s representatives have for several weeks been formulating a plan to get him back in front of the public in a show that would have some elements of his television work combined with new stage elements .
After exploring the degree of interest with some locations , Mr. O’Brien ’s team has received “ enormous interest from all over , ” said one of his representatives , who asked not to be identified because the plans are not yet ready to announce .
“ We ’ve heard from the U.K. , Scandinavia , Australia , Toronto , everywhere ; it ’s been incredible . ”
No dates have been finalized yet but the representative said Mr. O’Brien would appear in multiple cities , probably in sizeable venues like Radio City Music Hall in New York .
“ The interest is enough that Conan could probably do stadiums , but he does n’t want to , ” the representative said .
As for the show itself , another representative of the comic said staff members from his NBC show would probably be involved , from members of the band to writers who will help Mr. O’Brien craft new material for the show .
“ It ’s one way to get some of the guys some money , ” the representative said .
A formal announcement is some weeks away , both representatives said .
Mr. O’Brien himself has been vacationing and is expected to begin participating in the planning starting next week .
Unusual sex chromosome creates third sex in Hessian flies
WEST LAFAYETTE , Ind . - Expectant human parents might wish for a boy or girl , but Hessian flies actually have a third option , and , no matter what , the flies are never surprised by the sex of their offspring .
Jeff Stuart , a Purdue University professor of entomology , and graduate student Thiago Benatti found that a sex chromosome in the mother predetermines the sex of Hessian fly offspring .
The chromosome carries a gene called Cm ( chromosome maintenance ) that can create one of three basic sexes .
" When a mother carries this chromosome , she produces two types of females : female - producing females and male - producing females .
Without the chromosome , the mother produces only males , " Stuart said .
" That means the species is composed of three different sex- related groups . "
In humans , an egg contains an X chromosome , and a sperm contains an X or a Y .
When sperm and egg unite , offspring with an XX combination become female and offspring with an XY combination become male .
In Hessian flies , however , a female with the unusual chromosome , called W - prime ( W ' ) produces only females .
Half of her offspring will carry the W ' and produce only females , whereas the other half lacking the W ' will produce only males .
Cm , one or more genes on the chromosome , has caused the evolution of the W ' chromosome .
It arose because the chromosome combination in Hessian flies is n't created at conception , as is the case with humans , but is established by chromosome elimination during embryonic development .
" I think that the mechanism of embryonic chromosome elimination is an evolutionary remnant of when this insect 's ancestors were able to produce offspring without having sex , " said Stuart , whose findings were released in the March issue of the journal Genetics .
Understanding the sex- determination process in the Hessian fly could lead to a way to control its populations or eliminate it altogether .
The Hessian fly is the major pest of wheat crops , causing millions of dollars of damage annually .
Stuart said it might be possible to genetically modify Hessian flies using the Cm gene to eliminate the fly 's ability to produce one of the sexes .
Those modified flies could be introduced into fly populations to eliminate it as a pest .
" We 're hopefully going to be able to manipulate this to bring the insect to its own demise , " he said .
" We may be able to use it to drive maladaptive traits into the population . "
Stuart said the next step in the research would be to study the evolution of the Cm gene and determine the mechanisms it uses to control sex determination .
Stuart 's research was funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Research Initiative .

The American Civil Liberties Union has never treated the Obama administration with kid gloves , but with their latest ad buy it ’s become increasingly clear that their patience for the continuance of some Bush - era policies has run quite thin .
“ What will it be Mr. President ? ” the ACLU asks in a full - page New York Times advertisement published Sunday .
“ Change or more of the Same ? ”
The ad also features a portrait of Obama that morphs into Bush .
ADVERTISEMENT
The ACLU ’s images of the subtle transition between presidents is filtered and lacking in detail , and spans just four frames .
However , it appears to be a take - off of a protest image that circulated Facebook and some progressive blogs late last year , showing a similar transition in eerie detail .
The ACLU ’s full - size advertisement is below this text .
The ad specifically pressured the administration to hold fast to their decision to try the alleged 9/11 plotters in the judicial system and not by military tribunal as many Obama opponents have called for .
President Barack Obama ’s administration had announced it would try self - confessed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other accused at a New York courthouse , just steps from where the World Trade Center once stood .
But the plan for the “ trial of the century ” met a backlash from Republican lawmakers who have introduced legislation to require a military trial , throwing a challenge to Obama months ahead of mid-term elections in November .
ADVERTISEMENT
Obama made bringing Sheikh Mohammed to a civilian trial a centerpiece of a broader plan to end what he saw as serious abuses of law in the time of his predecessor George W. Bush and his powerful vice president Dick Cheney .
The Washington Post reported earlier this week that aides were recommending that Obama adopt Republicans ’ position and proceed with a military trial as part of a deal that could help him shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison .
A White House official said Friday it would need weeks to decide on the trial of the accused 9/11 co-conspirators .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ As president , Barack Obama must decide whether he will keep his solemn promise to restore our Constitution and due process , or ignore his vow and continue the Bush - Cheney policies , ” the ACLU ad read .
ACLU executive director Anthony Romero also wrote a letter to Obama saying these were “ the most important terrorism trials — and arguably the most important criminal trials — in the entire history of the nation .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We placed this ad because it ’s critical that Americans know what is at stake here : nothing less than America ’s commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law .
The military commissions are seriously flawed and unprepared to handle these complex cases .
If President Obama reverses his attorney general ’s principled decision under political pressure , it will strike a devastating blow to American values and do serious damage to our nation ’s credibility .
We urge the president to do the right thing and keep these cases in federal court , where they belong . ”
“ It would be a colossal mistake to reverse the administration ’s decision to try these defendants in federal criminal court and again relegate these landmark trials to irretrievably defective military commissions . ”
However the plan has seen growing opposition from groups criticizing the cost of security in Manhattan and in some cases the principle of providing civilian trials with greater protections for the alleged 9/11 plotters .

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg changed his mind at the end of January after initially backing the civilian trial in Manhattan , suggesting that the highly sensitive case could instead proceed on a military base .
In its ad , the ACLU noted that the US criminal justice system has “ successfully handled ” more than 300 terror - related cases , compared to only three by military commission .

Astronauts put the last big addition on the International Space Station early Friday , attaching a new room with an enormous bay window that promises to provide unprecedented panoramic views of Earth .
The room , named Tranquility , was hoisted into place by the station 's Canadarm 2 robotic arm as a pair of spacewalking astronauts floated nearby , excitedly watching everything take shape .
" We 've got a whole bunch of camera views … and every one of them looks spectacular , " astronaut Stephen Robinson radioed from inside the shuttle - station complex .
" It looks spectacular from here , too , " replied spacewalker Nicholas Patrick .
Patrick and Robert Behnken carried out the first spacewalk of the mission with amazing speed .
They were an hour ahead at one point and picked up some extra chores 350 kilometres up .
Behnken pushed out so hard and fast that Mission Control urged him to slow down as he moved over to Endeavour 's payload bay and got the new compartments ready for installation on the space station .
The Tranquility hookup job is so big and complicated it will require three spacewalks .
Thursday night 's excursion — which stretched into the wee hours of Friday — was the first .
Robinson noted it was a " noble start " to this spacewalk extravaganza .
Station 98 % complete
Tranquility and the domed lookout represent $ 400 million in home improvements .
The lookout , with its seven windows , including the largest ever sent into space , already has astronauts salivating over the anticipated views of the home planet , as well as their orbital home .
Behnken and Patrick had to wait for the seven metre long Tranquility to be anchored onto the space station before they could hook up power and data cables .
The heavy lifting fell to the astronauts inside who operated the Canadarm .
The plumbing will be tackled during a second spacewalk Saturday night .
The dome — which resembles a cupola 1.5 metres deep and nearly 3 metres in diameter — will be moved to its final location on Tranquility next week .
Only then will the window shutters be unlocked and raised .
NASA readily acknowledges the observation deck and its 360 - degree views will improve the quality of life aboard the orbital outpost , where astronauts spend up to six months at a stretch .
The addition of the Italian - designed Tranquility and dome leaves the space station 98 per cent complete .
Four more shuttle visits remain before the fleet is retired , primarily to stockpile spare station parts and supplies .
NASA hopes to wrap everything up by the end of September .

The UK National Trust is warning of a 2 - 4C rise in summer temperatures by the end of the century .
They envision English gardens full of palm trees , Bougainvillea and tropical fruit , as seen above .
The apple orchards have been replaced with orange groves , the turf covered over with gravel and the summer borders replanted with cacti .
They may look like scenes from a Portugese holiday , but these images could be the future of the traditional English garden , plant experts claimed yesterday .
The striking images are part of a National Trust campaign to highlight how gardens will look if global warming brings Mediterranean weather to Britain in the next few decades .
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1260213/National-Trust-campaign-highlights-gardens-look-global-warming-brings-Mediterranean-weather-Britain.html#ixzz0j46HSd0Q
And Met Office Climate models expect most of the northern hemisphere to turn red hot , particularly the Arctic which they expect to warm up by more than 16C in the next ninety years .
In the real UK ( the one that exists outside the Met Office Supercomputers ) the last three summers have all been complete washouts , the last two winters have been bitter cold , and over the last eighty years , summertime temperatures have risen only 0.5C .
Graph generated from Met Office UK temperature data
Most of the observed 0.5C rise has likely been due to UHI effects , as the UK population has increased by 50 % since 1930 .
Many people in England would prefer to see the tropical paradise which the National Trust promises , but in the meantime they will just have to live with the usual UK rain .
However , it is commendable that the National Trust employs top notch artists with an active imagination .

These studies by the Met Office and National Trust lead me to the inevitable scientific question – what are these people thinking with these forecasts ?

Should the Government Stop Outsourcing Code Development ?
Information technology is increasingly everywhere , and it ’s the same technologies everywhere .
The same operating systems are used in corporate and government computers .
The same software controls critical infrastructure and home shopping .
The same networking technologies are used in every country .
The same digital infrastructure underpins the small and the large , the important and the trivial , the local and the global ; the same vendors , the same standards , the same protocols , the same applications .
With all of this sameness , you ’d think these technologies would be designed to the highest security standard , but they ’re not .
They ’re designed to the lowest or , at best , somewhere in the middle .
They ’re designed sloppily , in an ad hoc manner , with efficiency in mind .
Security is a requirement , more or less , but it ’s a secondary priority .
It ’s far less important than functionality , and security is what gets compromised when schedules get tight .
Should the government — ours , someone else ’s ? — stop outsourcing code development ?
That ’s the wrong question to ask .
Code is n’t magically more secure when it ’s written by someone who receives a government paycheck than when it ’s written by someone who receives a corporate paycheck .
It ’s not magically less secure when it ’s written by someone who speaks a foreign language , or is paid by the hour instead of by salary .
Writing all your code in - house is n’t even a viable option anymore ; we ’re all stuck with software written by who - knows - whom in who - knows - which - country .
And we need to figure out how to get security from that .
The traditional solution has been defense in depth : layering one mediocre security measure on top of another mediocre security measure .
So we have the security embedded in our operating system and applications software , the security embedded in our networking protocols , and our additional security products such as antivirus and firewalls .
We hope that whatever security flaws — either found and exploited , or deliberately inserted — there are in one layer are counteracted by the security in another layer , and that when they ’re not , we can patch our systems quickly enough to avoid serious long - term damage .
That is a lousy solution when you think about it , but we ’ve been more - or - less managing with it so far .
Bringing all software — and hardware , I suppose — development in - house under some misconception that proximity equals security is not a better solution .
What we need is to improve the software development process , so we can have some assurance that our software is secure — regardless of what coder , employed by what company , and living in what country , writes it .
The key word here is “ assurance . ”
Assurance is less about developing new security techniques than about using the ones we already have .
It ’s all the things described in books on secure coding practices .
It ’s what Microsoft is trying to do with its Security Development Lifecycle .
It ’s the Department of Homeland Security ’s Build Security In program .
It ’s what every aircraft manufacturer goes through before it fields a piece of avionics software .
It ’s what the NSA demands before it purchases a piece of security equipment .
As an industry , we know how to provide security assurance in software and systems .
But most of the time , we do n’t care ; commercial software , as insecure as it is , is good enough for most purposes .
Assurance is expensive , in terms of money and time , for both the process and the documentation .
But the NSA needs assurance for critical military systems and Boeing needs it for its avionics .
And the government needs it more and more : for voting machines , for databases entrusted with our personal information , for electronic passports , for communications systems , for the computers and systems controlling our critical infrastructure .
Assurance requirements should be more common in government IT contracts .
The software used to run our critical infrastructure — government , corporate , everything — is n’t very secure , and there ’s no hope of fixing it anytime soon .
Assurance is really our only option to improve this , but it ’s expensive and the market does n’t care .
Government has to step in and spend the money where its requirements demand it , and then we ’ll all benefit when we buy the same software .

Surveillance systems are basically used to monitor commercial places , traffic red lights and lots of private companies but i am sure that lots of people out there must be interested in keeping an eye on your home and what ’s going on in your home when needed or when you are away from your house like sitting in the office .
This post is totally about that .
Here below there is a complete video surveillance system but most important from that is how you can do it with Linux .
First
What is the need / use of this :
Keep an eye on your home when you are working in the office or record the complete video of the day events .
Can keep an eye on your kids whether they are back from the school and what are their day to day activities .
Can secure your valuable items by keeping a tab on it means you can easily alert the police in case you see something wrong in your house when you are away from house .
The accessories you will be using for Video surveillance system are :
Cameras : Wires / wireless / night vision , any of it which you think you need and fall into your budget .
Stand Alone Network DVR / PC based DVR :
Where you can record , view and store on internal hard disk ( 4 - channel / 8 - channel depends on your requirement ) Static Internet IP : Broadband connection can be converted into static IP with some extra charges .
At least 1 Mbps connection is good enough to implement stuff .
1TB hard disk :
In built hard disk in Network DVR Wires : Based on the requirements , normal prices are 35 Rs/ meter .
Connecting to LCD :
Network DVR has a VGA port where you can connect to your LCD TV .
It ’s pretty much simple like connecting your CPU to the monitor .
Connecting to Normal TV :
Network DVR has normal pin based connector to connect to CRT TV’s .
One more thing , you can connect both the LCD and CRT TV’s at the same time but you need to switch on / off the VGA button in the DVR .
Steps to complete the setup :
Find some good place ( depend on what type of surveillance you are looking for , like some hidden place if you do n’t want people to know that they are under surveillance ) and fit the cameras you had bought .
Finish up the wiring needed to connect cameras .
Connect the 4 - channel DVR points to cameras at the other end .
Connect the DVR to your internet modem ( bridge mode / nat mode ) .
Put in the static IP in your browser .
Enter the login credentials and start watching your home from any remote location where you can just access the internet .
One more thing , every LCD has a VGA pin , you can ask for laptop LCD connector cable from shop , and use the same cable to connect both the LCD and DVR to transfer the video .
Linux Setup :
Above i was just explaining a normal setup which a normal person will do but what you should do when you are a linux geek .
Here it comes .
U need the following stuff and your complete monitoring system is ready .
Apparatus :
Linux Box ( Intel P3 / P4 old box loaded with some linux flavor like Fedora or Ubuntu ) USB Webcam ( Starting cost 300 rs ) Install Zoneminder , a open source application .
( Screenshots ) .
Internet with real IP .
Obviously when you are using linux then you should be given some benefits .
Following the the alternatives for the same : dyndns can be configured on your system / router and you can use your dynamic IP as the static one .
Auto upload the jpeg frame to any FTP Server .
Auto mail the small clips / jpeg to personal email account .
Supports more than 20 usb / dvr cameras .
Easy to access with control panel .
motion sensor feature can be used , hence you only record when it is required ( will save a lot of space ) .
FAQ’s :
1 . Why do i really need it ?
Ans :
No one really need it , it ’s just extra ring of precaution you are putting up to make sure that your valuables are safe .
For ex :
You are sitting 15 KM away in your office and someone break into your house .
This could be the best way to know what ’s going on in your house and you can alert the security for the same without even moving from your chair .
2 . Why need a LCD when you have the browser to watch ?
Ans :
You are sleeping and your door bell rings and you wanted to know who is on the door without leaving you bed or you are watching your favorite serial or last few balls are left for the match .
You have the remote beside you and you switch the mode of the TV from TV to av1 / av2 and there it is .
You know who is really ringing on your door .

THE Greek debt crisis has spread to Spain and Portugal in a dangerous escalation as global markets test whether Europe is willing to shore up monetary union with muscle rather than mere words .
Julian Callow from Barclays Capital said the European Union might need to invoke emergency treaty powers to halt the contagion by issuing an EU guarantee for Greek debt .
" If not contained , this could result in a ' Lehman - style ' tsunami spreading across much of the EU , " he said .
Credit default swaps measuring bankruptcy risk on Portuguese debt surged 28 basis points on Thursday to a record 222 on reports that Jose Socrates was about to resign as prime minister after failing to secure enough votes in parliament to carry out austerity measures .
Parliament minister Jorge Lacao said the political dispute had raised fears that the country was no longer governable .
" What is at stake is the credibility of the Portuguese state , " he said .
Portugal has been in crisis since the Maoist - Trotskyist bloc won 10 per cent of the vote last year .
This is rapidly turning into a market crisis as well as investors digest a revised budget deficit of 9.3 per cent of gross domestic product for 2009 , much higher than expected .
A €500 million ( $ 791 million ) debt auction failed on Wednesday .
The yield spread on 10 - year Portuguese bonds has risen to 155 basis points over German bunds .
Whenever I see a sign like the one below hanging outside of an abandoned property , I immediately feel an intense desire to get inside .
When such a sign is hanging outside a hotel built in the early 1900 ’s in Southern California that has been boarded up since 1939 , that urge goes through the roof .
Let me repeat : has been boarded up since 1939 .
The hotel was built in the Spanish Revival - style at the turn of the century , similar to the infamous Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles …

out his photostream for more great pictures )
… and the Mission Inn in Riverside California .

On a beautiful summer morning this past September , I met up with my contact for the first time in person , and together we approached the grounds .
The caretaker met us at the enormous iron gates surrounding the property and escorted us in .
Founded in 1917 , I ’m told the hotel was once THE destination for California ’s upper class , including Hollywood ’s elite looking to escape LA for a night or two .
As we roamed the grounds making our way to the entrance , it became clear that , guests or no guests , the caretaker takes his job very seriously .
Though a bit overgrown in places , the grounds are absolutely stunning , with a full array of Southern Californian vegetation .
Antique relics are strewn about the property , like this top to a Greek column ( known as a capital ) :
We passed by an old gardening shed .
The caretaker now has a much larger facility on the grounds to deal with the upkeep of the hotel , but has left this as a memento of simpler times .
As we continued down the walk , we passed by this statue .
I ’ve explored about a zillion abandoned places in my scouting travels , and 99 % of the time , something like this would have long since been stolen or vandalized .
And yet here it is , in perfect condition , as if we had stepped into the past .
Unbelievable .
Despite the caretaker ’s efforst , there are some signs of decay , like this worn hole in the pathway wall .
Still , excellent shape overall for 70 + years .
This sign had me stumped – what the heck is a natatorium ?
According to Wikipedia , it ’s an old word for a structurally separate building housing a pool …
Judging from this list of amenities , you can imagine how large the property must have been .
Unfortunately , most of it has been sold off over the years to developers .
Driving through California ’s newest suburbs , you ’d never know stables or a grand terrace formerly occupied the space .
As you head to the main entrance , you pass under a lattice wood roof , covered in vines .
This old pool , covered in cracks , has n’t been filled with water in decades ( well , excluding rain ) .
I love these beautiful lily pad lights .
I ca n’t imagine how beautiful their glow would be in a filled pool .
The cracks are pretty upsetting , but the caretaker is hoping to repair them in the near future .
Also want to point out the beautiful tile work :
Continuing on , I love how the trees have taken a stranglehold around the posts .
A look up toward the hotel ’s balconies :
This gorgeous balcony at the front of the hotel once commanded an unparalleled view of the Pacific .
Now , with all the overgrowth , you ’d never even know it was there .
Before I post my interior pictures , I wanted to elaborate a bit more on the closing of the hotel .
In 1939 , there was a tragic fire .
It started at approximately 11:51 PM in one of the upper guest suites , and is believed to have been caused by a lightening strike .
The plasterboard used throughout most of the hotel turned out to be particularly flammable , and the fire swept through the upper floors where the wealthiest clients were staying .
Poorly designed escape routes instantly became inaccessible , and in the end , over 45 people were killed , nearly all of whom belonged to very rich and very powerful families .
The resulting lawsuits closed the hotel down for good .
Contractors were jailed , the owners disgraced , and even California fire code laws were changed over the incident .
Hope remained that sometime in the future , the hotel would be able to re-open to its former glory .
Unfortunately , the death of the family patriarch sent the heirs into a frenzy over ownership , and it looks like that day will never come .
Though the front doors have been boarded up , the caretaker led us through a service entrance .
After passing through a series of dark tunnels , we finally wound up in the lobby , to which he had recently restored lighting and power .
Words fail me …
The ceiling in particular is amazing :
The old front desk .
Note the luggage – apparently , after the fire was finally extinguished , luggage was gathered in the lobby for guests to retrieve .
Apparently , some guests simply fled , leaving their belongings behind .
They have remained here ever since .
A close - up look at the front desk , complete with bell :
To the right of the entrance is the concierge desk .
I love the lampshade :
A game of mahjongg has never been finished :
An old room service cart , complete with antique teacups and kettle .
The newspaper ’s date is that of the fire :
Beside the sofa , a dust - covered wine glass still sits on a napkin :
Love this image of the fireplace – the owl ( or is it a hawk ? ) seems particularly ominous .
More forgotten luggage as you make your way in :
An ancient phone long since disconnected .
Clothing from a bygone era .
This directory was positioned beside the elevators :
This window display case exhibits some of the expensive items that were once available in the hotel ’s gift shop :
We trucked down into the basement , which is filled with junk :
This old radio still works !
Finally , the telegraph room , with newspaper clippings and photos tacked up by former employees .
And that ’s all I can post … for now !
I ’m hoping it gets landmark status in the future .
If by any chance you ’ve ever been here , please , leave a comment describing your experience !
And if you ever have the chance to visit the hotel for yourself someday , I ’d avoid the elevators if I were you .
They ’re very unreliable .

The project ’s advantages are obvious : electricity generated from the sun will allow FPL to cut natural gas use and reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
It will provide extra power when it is most needed : when the summer sun is shining , Floridians are cranking up their air - conditioning and electricity demand is at its highest .
The plant also serves as a real - life test on how to reduce the cost of solar power , which remains much more expensive than most other forms of electrical generation .
FPL Group , the parent company of Florida Power and Light , expects to cut costs by about 20 percent compared with a stand - alone solar facility , since it does not have to build a new steam turbine or new high - power transmission lines .
“ We ’d love to tell you that solar power is as economic as fossil fuels , but the reality is that it is not , ” Lewis Hay III , FPL ’s chairman and chief executive , said on a recent tour of the plant .
“ We have got to figure out ways to get costs down .
As we saw with wind power , a lot has to do with scale . ”
For solar power , scale is still a relative term .
At its peak , the solar plant will be able to generate 75 megawatts of power , enough for about 11,000 homes .
But that is dwarfed by the adjacent gas plant , which can produce about 3,800 megawatts of power .
( A megawatt is enough to power a Wal - Mart store . )
Utilities are being pulled in different directions .
They must ensure that the lights remain on at all times as well as provide the lowest - cost power to their customers .
At the same time , they are being pressed to find ways to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and invest in renewable power sources .

Once you 've used the hand - helping , time - saving , two - finger scrolling and three - finger gestures on a MacBook , a standard Windows trackpad can feel kind of , well , dead .
Here 's how to get total finger control with a tiny app , or go further with a driver swap .

Let 's put this out there right away :
This wo n't give you the Mac 's pinch - to - zoom or rotation powers , but it will give you nearly everything else .
Also , I tested this out on just one laptop , a ThinkPad T61 p , and the more complex version of this trick relies on unofficial — some might even say hacked — drivers for Synaptics touchpads .
Most every non-Mac laptop ships with a Synaptics touchpad , and various bloggers and forum users with different laptop builds have reported it working .
You may experience some quirks or buggy behavior , and if you opt for the full driver replacement , you 'll have to avoid upgrading that driver to keep everything in place .
But the benefits for those who do a lot of browsing or document editing are pretty significant , and the likelihood of an absolutely crucial trackpad update is fairly slim .

If you only want simple two - finger scrolling in your web browser without having to mess with your touchpad drivers , follow this post through only the ( very simple ) first section .
If you 'd like to get configurable two - finger , three - finger , circular and gesture - based actions on your laptop , we 'll dive into that in just a bit .
The Simple Two - Finger Scrolling Fix
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Two - Finger - Scroll is a tiny little utility that does n't require installation , configuration , or anything , really , other than a double - click to launch .
On most trackpads , running two - finger - scroll will simply make dragging two fingers up and down on your trackpad scroll a window with a vertical tracking bar up and down , as if you were moving the middle scroll wheel up and down .
Advertisement
If that vertical two - finger scrolling is all you want , and you want it to stick around the next time you restart Windows , check your system tray .
It might be hidden away , but there should be a TwoFingerScroll icon that you can right - click to turn on and off , and right - click to select " Settings . "
In the settings , you can have TwoFingerScroll start with Windows , but you can also do a lot more .
Check out the next tab , " Scrolling , " where you can set up exactly how your two - finger scrolling should work .
In my own case , I kept the speed and acceleration defaults , disabled " Keep scrolling on edges , " and switched to " Smooth " for the Scroll Mode .
I have n't really broken them in and figured out what exactly I like , because , hey , two - finger scrolling in Windows is entirely new to me .
Advertisement
Head to the next tab to the right , and you 'll see that you can actually manage two and three - finger tapping from TwoFingerScroll .
I have n't played with these features as much , but if your trackpad has a middle button function , or an equivalent " Button4 " and " Button5 , " you can set a two , three , or " two plus one " ( two fingers together , one just outside ) tap to do what those buttons would normally do .
I could see these functions being helpful for quick right - clicking or , perhaps , triggering an Escape key or the like , but I 've generally left this section well enough alone .
If you know of some clever uses for multi - finger taps , do tell in the comments !
Sick of TwoFingerScroll , or not seeing it do much good ?
Disable it from the system tray and uninstall it the way you would any program .
If disabling temporarily does n't seem to work , kill it by hitting Ctrl + Shift + Esc , selecting the Processes tab , and clicking End Process with TwoFingerScroll.exe selected .

The Whole Shebang : Gestures , Three Fingers , and More
Want to get a bit more in control of your scrolling , and add features like circular scrolls and three - finger swipes and gestures ?
You 'll need to install a modified version of the Synaptics drivers your laptop likely uses .
Advertisement
Uninstall your existing Synaptics drivers , or the touchpad / trackpad drivers your laptop manufacturer provided , by heading to Control Panel , selecting " Uninstall a program " under the Programs heading , and removing those choices that relate to your trackpad control .
You can also use an app like Revo Uninstaller Free to hunt down those drivers if they do n't appear , or are hard to discern , in your Add / Remove Programs dialog .
You might have to restart after your uninstall , and it might be the first of a few restarts .
To get multi - finger gestures on your trackpad , you 're going to install a set of trackpad drivers that were intended for a certain netbook in a foreign locale , but which have been modified for more general use .
The drivers I installed on my ThinkPad came from a packaged dubbed synaptics_v10.2.4.0_allOS_modded_b2.zip , and I grabbed them from a file sharing service linked at the My Digital Life blog , where you can also find 64 - bit specific drivers , if needed .
If that free file hosting service does n't work for you , or you want to try and avoid the annoying 60 - second download delay , run a Google search for that package , and be sure to scan the download ZIP file for viruses before you install it .
Advertisement
Extract the files from the ZIP package you downloaded , double - click the Setup file to start the installation process , and if you 're asked to verify that you want to install an " untrusted " or unverified driver , go ahead and do so .
Once you 're through the setup process , you 'll likely be asked to restart once again .
Allow your system to restart .
When you boot up again , you may be asked if you 're sure you want to allow programs related to your Synaptics driver installation to run on your system , seeing as how they were downloaded from the internet and all .
Un - check the boxes in the lower - left that ask something akin to " Always ask for this type of file , " and you wo n't see these prompts on your next start - up .
Advertisement
Open a browser , or a document with enough vertical content to scroll up and down , and see what happens when you slide two fingers up or down .
If you 're scrolling , hey , that 's great !
If not , you may still need to install TwoFingerScroll to manually enable your own two - finger scrolling .

Now , the good stuff .
Head to Control Panel , into the " Hardware and Sound " section , and select " Mouse . "
The farthest - right tab should have a red icon and read " Device Settings . "
Make sure Synaptics Touchpad is selected in that tab , then hit the " Settings " button below it .
You 'll see a whole realm of options there to explore and customize .
The new stuff that you 'll want to pay close attention to is in a few places :
Under Pointer Motion , a selection named Sticky Borders , which controls what happens when you scroll to the edges of a window .
, which controls what happens when you scroll to the edges of a window .
Virtual Scrolling , where you may want to turn off the edge - of - trackpad scrolling that you 'd been using before .

Under the Pointer Motion heading , a sub-section named Momentum , which provides Apple - like scrolling based on scroll speed .
, which provides Apple - like scrolling based on scroll speed .
Three - Finger Gestures and its sub-sections , Top and Bottom , which relate to what happens when you drag three fingers up or down , respectively .
I prefer to use these gestures as page back and forward in a browser .
and its sub-sections , Top and Bottom , which relate to what happens when you drag three fingers up or down , respectively .
I prefer to use these gestures as page back and forward in a browser .
Two - Finger Gestures , where you can get fancy and add actions to diagonal drags , left - to - right and right - to - left flicks , and the like .

To repeat what was stated up top , you wo n't find any pinch - to - zoom or rotate gestures — at least on the laptop I was using .
Your mileage may vary , but that does n't seem to be something that made the transition to these modified drivers .

Abstract Art : Bold designs , creative layers , edgy appeal , funky colors & styles ...
From the day we opened our doors we have placed a particular emphasis on abstract art .
I guess you could say we have always had a special place in our hearts for abstraction !
Although the subject may be non-representational , true abstract art is more than just randomized brushstrokes .
We create attractive displays that are crisp and intentional , direct and intriguing , bold and daring , all the while still geometrically sound and balanced .
Our abstract art and decor collection is filled with the more creative , unexpected and funky pieces that our artists have brought to life over the years through creative eyes , innovative minds , and experienced hands .
We also frequently get requests for artwork or business logos to be customized with an abstract flair for night clubs , restaurants , hotels , art galleries , interior designers , or just passionate collectors of abstracts .
Last night , Zac Posen , Aerin Lauder , Vogue 's Tonne Goodman , agency executive David Bonnouvrier , casting director James Scully , and model Doutzen Kroes sat around a table in Chelsea discussing models ' health and tiny sample sizes .
Nobody uttered the words " eating disorder . "

Except once , that is , because there was apparently no way for Diane von Furstenberg to introduce the event moderator , Dr. David Herzog , without mentioning that the prevention and treatment of eating disorders happens to be his area of specialty .
The panel talk was part of the Council of Fashion Designers of America 's Health Initiative .
The CFDA began convening these meetings annually in January , 2007 , which was shortly after two models in South America , Ana Carolina Reston and Luisel Ramos , died of complications from eating disorders , and just before a third , Eliana Ramos , was killed by the same disease .

Everyone on the panel basically agreed that models ' health can be at risk in the industry , and that the influence of fashion and modeling on the wider culture is clear .
" I think that the health initiative is vital , " said Goodman , who is herself a former model .
" I have a 14 - year - old daughter . "
Bonnouvrier spoke of the " complicated moral and legal challenges " presented by the industry 's reliance on an often underaged and impoverished female workforce .
Kroes , who began modeling at the ripe old age of 18 , said , " I was told lots of times to lose weight .
There was always that statement , ' You'd be great , but you should lose a few pounds .'... There are naturally skinny girls , but not all of them [ are that way ] .
And I 'm not one of them . "
Scully , who cast his first show in 1983 , put it the most bluntly of all : " Things are very seriously wrong right now . "
" I can open up any magazine or pick any show and tell you what girls are taking Adderall , how many girls are taking Vicodin , how many girls are throwing up , how many girls are carrying flasks , " he said .
" Girls are really resorting to incredibly dangerous things . "

Agreeing on the nature of the problem is one thing , but did anyone have any solutions ?
" Collective responsibility " was invoked , as was the image of the ouroboros , eating its tail .
" When you 're dealing with a sample size , as it comes to Vogue magazine to be photographed , I 'm actually at the end of a process that has preceded me , " explained Goodman at the start of her talk .
That statement would imply that someone like Posen should be at the start of the process : that if designers simply cut their samples a little bigger , and booked healthier , fully post - pubescent girls for their shows , then those models would become in - demand and standards would change .
Not so , said Posen , who explained that designers are under pressure to conform to the norms of the industry , and that they often look to magazines to define the zeitgeist .
Then he added , " I am often challenged , you know , by what is cool .
And that usually comes down to the image makers , and that usually comes down to the new — " here he paused , as if searching for just the right word , " youth of the time . "
" But there is something that 's called too young , " averred Dr. Herzog .
" And maybe too vulnerable . "

" On both sides , " replied Posen .
" I think the designers are vulnerable as well ! "
How , exactly , a designer with money , influence , connections , a voice both within the industry and in the wider culture , who not only finished high school but probably attended college , is equally as " vulnerable " as a Ukrainian teenager who is living out of a suitcase in a model apartment and falling by the day into ever more significant debt to an agency that could theoretically drop her at any moment , Posen failed to quite explain .
" It 's a fine line , you know , but at the end of the day , health is great . "
During the Q&A section , I found myself wanting to cheer on Anna Wintour .
" I 'd like to ask the whole panel a question , " she announced in her clipped accent .
" I asked someone who works a lot with the shows if the Initiative was helping the problem at all .
And I very sadly report that this gentleman said , No , it was n't .
So what I would like to know is what can we do to help the problem .
Because obviously we 're not doing enough .
Because we 're not making progress . "
A female designer in the audience pointed out that the problem was solvable by the very people in the room , if in fact they had the will .
" Trends start by agreement .
We keep saying ' They started it , ' but we are ' they . '
We are they . "

Bonnouvrier stressed that the incredible shrinking model we 've all seen on the runways over the last 5 - 10 years is the result of the tremendous change the industry has undergone since the breakup of the former U.S.S.R .
" That trend was made possible by the fact that agencies and scouts were able to start traveling to countries that had just recently opened their borders and lifted the travel restrictions on their cities .
As opposed to the members of the European Union and the U.S. , which had laws mandatory laws regarding schooling and minor labor , these countries for the most part had very few of those .
And the result was a flood of ill - prepared , 15 - years - old [ models ] , who had a very short lifespan in this industry .
They quickly realized that , you know , once they crossed the threshold from 17 to 18 , their bodies were gonna morph into those of a younger woman , and they had very little recourse but to take a drastic action . "
Scully , who has in the past said , " Let 's stop treating models like greyhounds we plan to shoot after a race , " agreed that the injection of younger talent has destabilized the industry and left models disempowered .
In casting his fashion week shows , this season Scully saw 179 models — and 109 of them admitted to being 17 or younger .
Seventy - five said they were under 16 .
All of these girls were , he said , un-castable .
( He even cut a " 19 - year - old " who turned out to be just 15 from a show cast . )
" I can't tell a girl who 's never kissed a boy to go on a runway and be sexy .
That 's insane . "
Advertisement
In addition to the sometimes inappropriate nature of the work , the constant influx of new labor means models ' careers are telescoping .
" You know , there are times when I will have to book a Karlie Kloss because she 's exceptional , but what makes me sad is the disloyalty in this agency , and the way these girls are discarded as though they 're meat .
To me , for Karlie Kloss , what is to say what happened to Gemma Ward , what happened to Hilary Rhoda will not happen to her ?
We all love her today , but , you know , when she grows breasts and she turns 18 are we all going to turn on her ? "
Another reason offered for the rise of the extremely skinny model was the diminution of the magazines .
When Scully began in the industry , he said , magazines set the standards for models ' size , and models were all over the magazines — not celebrities .
As stars started to claim covers and pages during the last 5 - 10 years , magazines ' fashion clout decreased , and , he says , influential stylists broke from magazines and started looking to shows to express their aesthetic .
Advertisement
" In the last few years , " he explained , " there is a show in each major city that is now setting the standard . "
At these shows , Scully said , the average age of the cast is 13 - 17 .
The average weight of the models is 110 pounds .
One unnamed show " has now started calling agencies to say they will not go see a girl who has a hip that is larger than 33 " .
A teenage boy 's waist is 32 " .
33 " is almost — it 's ridiculous .
These are the people who are now setting the standard , because this girl gets this exclusive , or she has to be in this show , and these are the girls that everybody feels like they have to use . "
In case anyone is wondering , the houses Scully is most likely referring to are companies like Prada , Balenciaga , and Calvin Klein , who are all known for their reliance on extremely thin and extremely young show models .
While the use of underaged models — to give just one example , the Pole Monika Jagaciak was modeling internationally at 13 , and walked for Calvin Klein and a gaggle of other New York designers by the time she was 15 — and the hypothesis of the malevolent stylist are both interesting explanations , neither , in my opinion , is entirely sufficient to explain the problem .
While stylists may have left permanent positions at fashion magazines and begun to exert their influence on the shows , it does n't necessarily follow that somehow during this transition , they began to formulate their alleged skinny agenda .
What was preventing them from promoting an über - thin look all along , at the magazines ?
We need to determine what else changed to make that possible .
And as for models ' ages , well : like Crystal Renn told me after the talk , " You can have an eating disorder at any age . "
Renn , now a successful plus - size model , spent years battling an eating disorder while she was in her teens .
And models have always been extremely young : Carmen Dell ' Orefice was on the cover of Vogue at age 15 .
In 1947 .
Brooke Shields was 14 when she began modeling .
So was Niki Taylor , Linda Evangelista , and Christy Turlington .
Some of these women only modeled part - time during their high school years , but my instinct is that age alone is not able to explain the sudden and dramatic change in the ideal model weight since the turn of the millennium .
Advertisement
My guess is that the internationalization of the industry has led to the plummeting of wages — most runway shows , after all , pay only in " trade " — and a sudden power shift away from the models , both of which mean even girls ' health is negotiable .
Kroes returned to the question of sample sizes .
" I probably fit the sample size once .
When I was 11 , " she deadpanned .
" But I was 18 [ when I started modeling ] , and already being told to lose weight .
And I was skinnier back then . "
Although Kroes walked for a number of designers when she entered the industry , including Dolce & Gabbana and Versace , she was never known primarily as a runway girl because of her size , which deviated ever so slightly from the accepted 34 " - 24 " - 34 " norm .
( Or the 33 " - 23 " - 33 " norm that we seem to be heading toward today . )
Advertisement
" It was crazy , because I looked in the mirror , and I liked the way I looked .
So I had a meeting with my agent , I call it the so - called 'ass meeting . ' "
The audience laughed .
" Because , I had one !
It was there . "
Rather than try to lose weight by unhealthy means , Kroes — who was by that time already extremely successful — and her agent , Bonnouvrier , agreed to pursue work with her body the way it was .
She now works for companies like Victoria 's Secret and L'Oréal — big money brands that have little influence over the body type seen on the runway and in most magazines .
" I hope after what I 've done , I have chosen that I want to have a healthy lifestyle with the body that I have , and work around it , and I hope there will be more opportunity for girls to have a choice like that , " said Kroes .
Bonnouvrier said , " Of course you have someone like Doutzen and she is untouchable .
But the models wo n't talk .
There will be retribution sooner or later . "
Model Coco Rocha , in the audience , said that she had faced significant backlash following her talk at the CFDA 's Health Initiative of two years ago .
( Rocha then admitted having taken diuretics and eaten unhealthily little in order to further reduce her modeling weight . )
" I think people did listen to me , but people were either really pleased with me , or they hated me for it . "
Industry folk told her , " ' How could you say such things ? ' "
And Rocha is one of the most successful models working today .
Imagine , then , the vulnerability of an average model , someone with no public profile , on this issue .

Dr. Herzog was careful to explain that all eating problems are " complex " and none is attributable to any single factor .
( Diane von Furstenberg set the tone for the evening in many ways when she lamented in her welcoming statement that fashion is " often blamed " for promoting a body type that almost nobody , not even many professional models , can maintain in safety — in a tone of voice that implied she thought the blame was somehow less than warranted . )
" Before I came here this evening , " said Dr. Herzog , " I was having a bite to eat , and I was sitting across from someone who was about to go to a casting at 4 o'clock , and started to talk to her about modeling .
And she sort of gave me a little sense of that community — the modeling community .
And to some degree , how sophisticated the individuals are , who are models .
And that 's not always understood by the wider population . "
Bonnouvrier brought the discussion back to age .
" Someone 17 or 18 should barely be starting in this industry , and getting a first look at it and a first try .
I think too much too soon is what sends them back home with a problem . "
Advertisement
Posen interrupted him .
" There 's ideals that are so ingrained in our culture , though .
Kate Moss was young and cute and hot , and underaged and modeling , and great .
And that created a sensation .
And that 's going to be ingrained in our culture for a long time .
So it is gonna be something there that people in fashion are going to be drawn to . "
" But that 's an exception .
And the problem is when — "
Posen shot back , " People like exceptions in fashion . "
Bonnouvrier continued : " The problem is when exceptions become standards . "
Coca - Cola , vinegar , and baby oil .
It 's an ingredient list that sounds like something bored kids might concoct on a rainy day .

KXTV Sacramento : Miracle survivor : Bicyclist dragged under SUV recalls ordeal
George Warren
SACRAMENTO , CA – Sanjay Patel may never again have full use of his right leg , but he smiles as he speaks from his hospital bed because he still can’t believe he survived being dragged a quarter mile under an SUV .
“ I strongly believe in my God , and I can say that he saved me , ” said Patel , 26 , a Sacramento State University graduate student from India .
Patel was riding his bicycle home to his apartment at 7:20 p.m. Jan. 31 when he was hit by a suspected drunken driver who veered into the bike lane on Folsom Boulevard near La Riviera Drive .
Patel said he was briefly aware of headlights crossing onto the shoulder of the road but he had no time to react .
“ It was so sudden , I could n’t look behind . ”
Patel said he felt the impact of the Ford Explorer and immediately became lodged between the bumper and the asphalt .
“ I do n’t remember what position I was in , but I could just remember some of the parts of my body were dragging on the road .
I could feel that , ” he said .
The driver of the SUV , Amira Fakira , 23 , continued another quarter mile before turning onto Norcade Circle .
Patel was dislodged when Fakira made a U - turn back out onto Folsom Boulevard .
As he lay in the street , Patel was awake and alert and saw people coming quickly to help him .
He remembers one man in particular , Patrick Sims , who urged Patel not to look at his right leg because the kneecap was gone .
“ There was a lot of pain , but I made myself calm and waited for the ambulance , ” Patel said .
Patel was also aware of a young woman , Lupe Zavala , who held his head and tried to comfort him while they waited together for the paramedics .
“ Those are angels for me , ” he said .
At the time , Patel did n’t know Zavala and her husband , Johnathon Hobson , had witnessed the crash and that Hobson had dropped off his wife so that he could chase Fakira .
Hobson caught up to Fakira a mile away when she was forced to stop for a red light at Watt Avenue .
He reached through an open window and snatched the keys from the ignition .
From his hospital room at the UC Davis Medical Center , Patel watched the news conference two days after the crash when the California Highway Patrol honored Hobson and Zavala for their heroic efforts .
Patel said he was deeply touched when Hobson choked up as he shared the horror of watching the bicyclist being swept under the SUV .
Hobson and Zavala have since visited Patel in the hospital and the three have become friends .
Patel has also seen the video of Fakira being given a field sobriety test near the spot where he was dislodged from underneath her vehicle .
During the arrest , Fakira hurled obscenities at News10 photographer Brandon Atchison .
When he speaks of Fakira , however , Patel expresses disbelief more than anger .
“ She did n’t know what she did .
Even after everything , she was cursing your cameraman .
I saw that .
So what can I say about her ?
She was out of her mind . ”
Fakira faces multiple felony charges and returns to court Monday for continued proceedings .
Patel has undergone multiple surgeries on his leg , spine and chest .
His arms are still badly scarred and his scalp was torn , but aside from a small patch of scraped skin just below the hairline , his face was nearly unscathed .
Friday will be a big day for Patel when his doctors will ask him to stand on his right leg for the first time .
No one can say how much functionality the leg will ever achieve , and Patel is nervous about the future .
“ Will I be able to walk , run , dance ?
I do n’t know , ” he said .
Patel was in his final semester of a master ’s program in electrical and electronic engineering at Sac State , which must now wait .
A planned internship at an Intel plant in Phoenix this summer has also been jeopardized .
Patel now hopes to earn his degree next fall and return to his wife in India .
Patel ’s brother Vasand , 27 , arrived from India Wednesday to help him after he leaves the hospital , which could be next week .
Patel said he has enjoyed his two years in Sacramento .
Despite his near - death experience at the hands of one of its residents , he insisted he would leave with a positive impression because of what happened in the moments following the crash .
“ I can say that humanity is still here , ” he said with a smile .

Mayoral candidate Sarah Thomson unveiled her plan for a citywide subway system this morning , an issue which will be central to her campaign .
Thomson said she would pay for the project using road tolls , private partners , and redirected funds from the city ’s current LRT expansion plans .
If elected , Thomson says she would add 58 kilometres of track across the city , extending the subway west to Pearson Airport , east through Scarborough and north to York University .
The total cost would be upwards of $ 11 billion , based on estimates that each kilometre of track costs about $ 200 million to build and maintain .
“ Great cities build great subways and great subways build great cities , ” she said , in a line that will likely be repeated throughout her campaign .
On option would be adding a $ 5 toll for use of the city ’s two highways - the Gardiner and Don Valley Parkway - during peak hours , Monday through Friday .
The toll would expire after 10 years , or once the funds had been raised to pay for the subway project .

Who were the hardest workers on the Transcontinental Railroad ?
The Irish ?
The former slaves ?
No , it was the Chinese immigrants .
Without Chinese Immigration ,
It would have taken many more years to complete .
Although at first hated , Chinese immigrants grew to be respected by their many contributions to American society .
The Chinese endured a hard voyage from China only to find backbreaking work .
The immigrants started coming in the mid 1800 ’s and were treated horribly until the 1940’s .
Even though they experienced anything from racist laws to anti-Chinese riots , the Chinese immigrants still managed to accomplish astonishing feats .
In China ,
There were two types of people : the very wealthy and the very poor .
Rich people owned big houses .
They had many servants , maids , and butlers .
They practiced many beauty methods .
The most painful was the binding of little girls ’ feet .
Small feet , called “ lily feet ” , were considered a mark of feminine beauty .
It literally turned the girls into cripples .
The poor people had nothing close to the life of a rich person .
Many were rice farmers .
At least they had something to eat .
Those even poorer went hungry for days and had to resort to stealing from the farmers .
The poor made up the majority of the Chinese population .
Those people brought their hopes and dreams to America .
Beliefs made up an enormous part of life in China .
The three main religions were Buddhism , Taoism , and Confucianism .
Buddhism originated in India .
Many people did n’t worship Confucianism , but still acknowledged it .
The majority of the people worshiped Confucianism .
These beliefs were started by Kong Fu Zi , who is better known by his Latin name , Confucius .
Family honor also played an enormous role in China .
Parents believed that children owed a debt to the parents for raising them .
This “ debt ” could be repaid in many ways .
One way would be to take care of their parents when they grew old .
Another way was to send money to their parents , which many immigrants did .
This was an essential part of Chinese lifestyle .
All men in China had to wear the same hairstyle .
They shaved their forehead , and wore a long braid on the back of the head .
The braids were called a queue .
All men were required to wear them from the 1600 ’s to 1911 .
In the 1600 ’s , the Manchu Empire captured China .
Queues symbolized loyalty to the Manchu rulers .
Those who did n’t comply were committing treason and either imprisoned or executed .
Without their queues , Chinese immigrants could not return to China .
If it was cut off , they would have to grow a new one , which could take many years .
After the overthrow of the Manchu government , in 1911 , many Chinese people , in both China and America , cut off their queues in celebration of freedom .
The Opium Wars were a crucial element in immigration from China .
China wanted to stop importing opium to China .
The opium was turning many people in to mindless wanderers .
When the British refused , the Chinese attacked merchant ships .
The British retaliated by sending an armada .
China was defeated and opium trade continued .
China was no longer a closed nation .
People could immigrate to other countries .
Chinese immigrants flooded into California and the West Coast .
The immigration station most Chinese immigrants went to was Angel Island .
It was like Ellis Island for the West Coast .
However , immigrants could be detained for years .
To express their sadness , immigrants carved poetry onto the walls .
In the 1800 ’s and early 1900 ’s , the poems were dismissed as graffiti .
The conditions were much worse than Ellis Island .
Angel Island is no longer an immigration station and is now a national monument .
There were not many jobs available to Chinese immigrants that came in the mid 1800 ’s .
The immigrants either became miners , laundrymen , or opened restaurants .
Most of the miners came because the Gold Rush of 1949 .
They heard rumors of “ Gold Mountain ” , a land where gold could be picked up off the ground .
Most of the miners lived in San Francisco .
Unlike the white miners , the Chinese miners did n’t argue and fight .
They were cooperative and pooled their money together to buy new mines .
Miners lived in conditions that were usually very dirty .
Being a laundryman was worse than being a miner in some ways .
Laundrymen worked over 14 hours a day .
It was comparable to being a slave .
Laundries popped up all over the west coast .
Miners and laundrymen needed food , so immigrants opened restaurants .
The Asian food is still eaten today .
In America , Chinese immigrants settled in areas that became known as Chinatowns .
The biggest one was in San Francisco .
It attracted every Chinese person in California .
New immigrants could often meet relatives or friend in Chinatowns .
People went there because it was like their old life .
People spoke Chinese , wore Chinese clothes , kept Chinese customs , and ate the same food .
The food was much healthier than the American food .
It consisted of many fruits and vegetables .
They boiled their tea ( killing any germs in the water ) .
Many parts of the Chinatown were filthy .
People crammed in rooms to save money .
The conditions were like this until the Earthquake of 1906 .
It destroyed the San Francisco Chinatown .
This played a crucial role in Chinese immigration .
Not only did the new Chinatown was much more hygienic , but also the immigration records were destroyed .
Chinese immigrants claimed they were born here .
This might not seem important , but it played a part in Chinese immigration .
Anyone born in this country is a citizen .
The law states that any citizen of the U.S. can bring their offspring into the U.S.
Many of the new “ citizens ” brought “ paper sons ” to America .
Paper sons were usually the son of the immigrant ’s friend .
The paper sons had to be interrogated about their “ father ” .
The immigrant and the paper son agreed on answers .
The interrogation could last for hours .
If he failed the test , he would be deported and sent back the China .
Many Chinese boys came to America this way .
“ Hoping to catch a paper son in a lie , immigration officers asked specific questions , like `how many steps were in your father ’s house ?’. ”
The only reason for all the deceit is only because of the Chinese Exclusion Act .
In 1882 , the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed .
It was the first time an immigration limitation was passed on a certain group .
It was signed by President Chester Arthur .
It was ended in 1942 , when China and the U.S. were allies in WWII .
The wife of a Chinese general came to the U.S.
She promoted the war .
She also asked for the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act and it was repealed .
Many Americans hated the Chinese immigrants .
There were many reasons why Americans hated them .
Some hated the Chinese because they were more successful than some Americans .
On the other hand , others hated the Chinese because they looked so different .
Some participated in anti-Chinese riots .
Many Chinese immigrants were lynched .
Others were severely injured .
The worst riot lasted three days .
The National Guard was called in , but even that was n’t enough .
Eventually , the Navy was called in , and the riot was broken up .
These were n’t the only bigoted acts .
Racist laws were passed to give the Chinese a hard time .
The Sidewalk Ordinance prevented people from carrying poles with baskets on the ends .
It was deliberately aimed at the Chinese .
The Cubic Air Ordinance required every adult in San Francisco to have 500 cubic feet of living space .
In addition , the Foreign Miners Act taxed all foreign miners if they owned gold mines .
This deterred some miners from buying mines .
Perhaps the most ruthless law was the Scott Act .
It added to the Chinese Exclusion Act .
It announced that all Chinese immigrants outside of the U.S. could n’t come back in .
At this time , about 20,000 immigrants were in China visiting their family .
Many people changed their attitudes towards the Chinese during WWII .
WWII united China and the U.S ; they had a common enemy : Japan .
Many Chinese - Americans joined the military .
Because at first they experienced racial prejudice , most of the Chinese - Americans were cooks .
The few that actually fought were respected in the Army .
Some even made it to be the Squad Leader .
Because the Chinese were allies with the U.S. and the Japanese were its enemies , many stereotypical thoughts emerged .
Chinese faces were said to be “ kindly and honest ” , and Japanese faces were said to be “ cruel and arrogant ” .
This began an era of equality to the Chinese .
Chinese - Americans achieved great accomplishments .
There were many important people .
Michael Chang is a former professional tennis player .
He was the youngest person to win a Grand Slam .
He was also the first American to win the French Open in 34 years .
Another important Chinese - American is Yo Yo Ma .
He is a exceptional cellist who went to Juilliard School of Music .
In addition , another Chinese - American is I. M. Pei .
He is a renowned architect .
He has designed the glass pyramid in from of the Louvre museum in Paris .
Other buildings designed by him include the National Gallery of Art and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland , Ohio .
Furthermore , Jerry Yang founded Yahoo !.
It is now a leading Internet brand .
There are countless more significant people , but it is too many to list on paper .
Chinese Americans have made an enormous impact on American society .
Like many of the immigrants from other countries , the Chinese immigrants were mostly poor .
However when they got here , many were detained fro years at Angel Island .
Those who did manage to get to the mainland received hate and prejudice from Americans .
When the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed , Chinese immigration was restricted .
Some Chinese immigrants lied to the government , and said they were born in the U.S.
That way , they brought their children or “ paper sons ” here .
Even so , the children had to pass a difficult interrogation .
The Chinese finally proved themselves in WWII , when they fought with the U.S. Life would be very different without the impact of Chinese - Americans .
Heh , this is entertaining .
While Bill Nye argues for “ in whose best interest is denial ? ” and brings up the ridiculous CO2 on Venus argument , Joe Bastardi runs circles around him with technical graphs and explanations on forcing factors and their magnitudes .
Warmists scream “ weather is not climate ! ” .
We need to shout back “ Venus is not Earth ! ” since the Venusian atmosphere is entirely different in compositions and forcings , and we understand it far less than Earth’s .
Meanwhile , Bill O” Reilly seems more concerned about making his commercial break on time than saving the planet .
Nye needs a better argument , as Fox News viewers can see past the appeal to emotion .
Bastardi while far more technically competent than Nye , needs to focus on explaining a bit about natural cycles , since few viewers would know what the “ PDO ” is .
A caveat for both men , doing live TV debate by the seat of your pants is tough .
You ca n’t see each other , and you are communicating via earpiece audio .
Live TV is never easy , live via satellite interlinks is even tougher .

Staatliche Zähmung der Justiz Bernard Schmid
Frankreich : Das Amt des Untersuchungsrichters soll verschwinden
Juristen gelten normalerweise - von einer in Bürgerrechtsfragen engagierten Minderheit einmal abgesehen - als Mitglieder eines eher konservativen Berufszweigs .
Als Anwender des gültigen „ positiven “ Rechts scheinen sie eher den Bewahrern der bestehenden Ordnung nahe zu stehen , als umstürzlerische oder reformeuphorische Neigungen zu pflegen .
Auch wenn diese Feststellung in Frankreich , wo es eine links stehende und in Bürgerrechtssachen sehr profilierte Richtergewerkschaft unter dem Namen Syndicat de la magistrature gibt , nicht ganz so stark zutrifft wie in Deutschland , gilt sie prinzipiell auch westlich des Rheins .
Dort ist es aber nun innerhalb der Justiz und unter den Angehörigen juristischer Berufe in jüngster Zeit zur „ Gärung “ gekommen , und es rumort heftig in ihren Reihen .
Vergangene Woche , am 9 .
März , kam es zu einer Premiere : Erstmals mobilisierten Richter , Anwälte , Erzieher und Gefängniswärter gemeinsam zu einer Protestdemonstration gegen die Regierung – die Erzieher deswegen , weil ein Teil der Erzieher und Sozialarbeiter in Frankreich durch die Protection judicaire de la jeunesse ( PJJ ) angestellt wird , eine Einrichtung zum Jugendschutz sowie für die Betreuung schwer erziehbarer Jugendlicher , die dem Justizministerium untersteht .
Tausende Angehörige von Justizberufen demonstrierten in Paris , Bordeaux , Marseille und anderen Städten .
Worum geht es ?
Aber warum ballt sich so viel Unzufriedenheit im Juristen - und juristisch interessierten Milieu gegen die Regierungspolitik zusammen ?
Den Anstoß gab ein durch die französische Regierung angekündigte Justizreform .
Besonders erregt sind die Kritiker über zwei Punkte : die geplante Abschaffung des Untersuchungsrichters ; und die Überarbeitung der Gesetzgebung zu Finanzdelikten , die eine erhebliche Verkürzung der Verjährungsfristen beinhaltet .
Wo liegt das Problem ?
In Frankreich existierte bislang ein doppeltes Strafverfolgungssystem .
In den meisten Fällen ist für die Strafaufklärung und –verfolgung die Staatsanwaltschaft ( le parquet ) zuständig , die sich auf die Polizei als ihren verlängerten Arm stützen kann .
Doch für komplexe Strafverfahren , in denen umfangreiche Ermittlungen erforderlich sind – Durchsuchungen von Räumlichkeiten etwa öffentlicher Institutionen , Durchforsten von Firmenbilanzen , Anhörung unzähliger Zeugen – besteht daneben ein Untersuchungsrichter ( juge d’instruction ) .
Letzterem ist sein unabhängiger Status gesetzlich garantiert – im Unterschied zur Staatsanwaltschaft , die ausdrücklich an Weisungen aus dem Justizministerium gebunden ist .
An und für sich ist dies auch nicht schockierend , da die Staatsanwälte vor Gericht eine Anklage im Namen des Staates und der Gesellschaft vortragen .
Nur wirft diese Weisungsgebundenheit ein Problem auf , wenn es um „ heikle “ Verfahren geht , bei denen hochrangige Persönlichkeiten aus Politik oder Wirtschaft involviert sind .
So hätte es die " ELF - Affäre " ohne die Hartnäckigkeit von Untersuchungsrichterinnen wie Eva Joly ( inzwischen a.D. und , seit Juni 2009 , Europaparlamentarierin der Grünen ) und Laurence Vichnievsky nicht gegeben .
ELF Aquitaine ist eine Erdöl - und frühere französische Staatsfirma , die ab 1999 / 2000 durch Aufkauf im Megakonzern TOTAL aufgegangen ist.
ELF , früher ebenso wie TOTAL heute , ist dafür berüchtigt , in Staaten besonders des französischsprachigen Afrika – früheren Kolonien wie Kamerun und Gabun – dubiose Geschäftspraktiken zu führen .
Den jeweiligen , autokratischen Staaten wird das Erdöl in zu geringen Mengen und unterhalb der geltenden Weltmarktpreise verrechnet .
Dies schadet den jeweiligen Ländern und ihren Staatshaushalten – nutzt aber diktatorischen Regimes , weil diese unterwegs geschmiert werden , also dicke „ Kommissionen “ erhalten .
Im Falle der Erdölrepublik Gabun floss ein Teil dieser Kommissionen jedoch nach Frankreich zurück , weil die dortige Diktatur und französische Staats - und Regierungskreise dabei halbe - halbe machten .
Die Filiale ELF - Gabun spielte Jahrzehnte lang eine wichtige Rolle bei der Finanzierung aller staatstragenden Parteien in Frankreich .
Im Jahr 1994 brach die Affäre aus .
Sie führte nach langjährigem Verfahren 2003 zur Verurteilung hochrangiger Manager , aber auch Politiker wie Ex-Außenminister Roland Dumas .
Hätte es keine unabhängigen Untersuchungsrichterinnen gegeben , wäre diese Strafsache mit Bestimmtheit nie zur Anklage gekommen .
Doch nun soll das Amt des Untersuchungsrichters just verschwinden .
Übernehmen soll seine Rolle die – weisungsgebundene – Staatsanwaltschaft .
Die Regierung beruhigt , schon bislang seien nur 5 Prozent der Strafsachen von solchen Untersuchungsrichtern betreut worden , in 95 Prozent der Fälle habe die Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt .
Dies trifft zu , aber in den fünf Prozent geht es eben um die gesellschaftlich brisantesten Dossiers .
Eine linksliberale Pariser Tageszeitung titelt deswegen beispielsweise zur geplanten Justizreform : „ Eine Reform , um die Affären zu ersticken “ und " Die Prozesse , die nicht mehr stattfinden werden "
Wie wird die Reform gerechtfertigt ?
Die Regierung rechtfertigt ihre jetzt geplante Reform mit der „ Modernisierung “ des Justizwesens , unter Anpassung an andere EU - Länder , wo es in der überwiegenden Mehrzahl der Fälle keine dem französischen Untersuchungsrichter - ein durch Napoléon I. geschaffenes Amt - vergleichbare Institution gebe .
Dies trifft zwar im Prinzip zu , doch ist Vorsicht bei den Ländervergleichen geboten .
Denn in den angeführten Ländern ist zugleich oftmals eine andere Struktur gegeben ; mehrheitlich weisen sie beispielsweise eine Staatsanwaltschaft auf , die nicht in einem vergleichbaren Ausmaß weisungsgebunden ist wie die französische .
Beispielsweise in Italien , das seinen Untersuchungsrichter 1989 abschaffte und dessen frühere Befugnisse den Staatsanwaltschaften übertrug - aber dessen Staatsanwälte eine Unabhängigkeitsgarantie gegenüber den übrigen öffentlichen Gewalten besitzen , und in Schweden .
Oder in Portugal , wo die Unabhängigkeit der Staatsanwaltschaften seit 2002 in der Verfassung festgeschrieben wurde .
Zum Vergleich in den deutschsprachigen
Ländern
In der Bundesrepublik Deutschland wurde der zuvor bestehende Untersuchungsrichter anlässlich einer Reform der Strafprozessordnung 1974/75 abgeschafft .
Seitdem sind die Staatsanwaltschaften für die Ermittlung und Verfolgung von Delikten zuständig .
Ihre Mitglieder sind Beamte , die dem Justizministerium hierarchisch unterstellt sind .
Allerdings ist ihre Situation nicht direkt mit jener ihrer französischen Kolleginnen vergleichbar , denn das deutsche Beamtenrecht weist einige Besonderheiten auf .
Aufgrund eines Prinzips der engen Rechtsbindung sind deutsche Staatsanwälte gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet , bei Kenntnis von einer Straftat Ermittlungen dazu aufzunehmen - und machen sich im Prinzip selbst strafbar , falls sie dies unterlassen .
Das französische Justizsystem funktioniert , vor allem an seiner Spitze , nach stärker politisierten Mechanismen :
In Frankreich misstraut man seit zwei Jahrhunderten einem gouvernement des juges , also einer Unterordnung politischer Entscheidungen unter das Spezialistentum von ( hauptberuflichen und nicht gewählten ) Rechtsexperten .
Dies hatte ursprünglich spezifische historische Gründe :
Unter der Französischen
Revolution stammte die große Mehrheit der Richterschaft und der studierten Juristen aus dem Staatsdienerkorps des Ancien Régime , der Monarchie - und waren daher verdächtig , der Reaktion verbunden zu sein und die laufenden politischen und gesellschaftlichen Veränderungen abzulehnen .
Die Politik , die sich als Träger dieser Veränderungen verstand , wollte sich nicht in Abhängigkeit vom nicht gewählten Expertentum der Juristen begeben , um den Elan der Revolution nicht fesseln zu lassen .
Seitdem allerdings hat sich der Sinngehalt der - relativen , aber realen - politischen Kontrolle über den Justizapparat erheblich verändert :
Es längst geht nicht mehr darum , den Drang zu progressiven Veränderungen von historischen „ Fesseln “ zu befreien , sondern um die Bewahrung der Macht bestehender gesellschaftlicher Eliten .
In Österreich , wo die zuvor dort ebenfalls bestehenden Untersuchungsrichter bei einer Strafprozessreform im Jahr 2008 abgeschafft wurden , gab es zuvor vergleichbare Debatten zu jenen , die derzeit in Frankreich geführt werden .
Aber schlussendlich wurde die statutarische Unabhängigkeit der Staatsanwaltschaft verfassungsrechtlich festgeschrieben , als die Reform 2008 in Kraft traten .
Ähnliches gilt für die künftige Stellung der Staatsanwaltschaft in der Schweiz , wenn die Reform des Strafprozessrechts dort 2011 in Kraft tritt .

After years of usage , your WordPress database can contain weird characters , be filled with data you do n’t need anymore , and so on .
In this article , you will learn about SQL queries to clean up your WordPress database .
Two things to note : First , any of these queries should be preceded by a backup of your whole database .
Secondly , do n’t forget to replace the wp_ table prefix by the prefix used on your WordPress website install , otherwise , the queries wo n’t work .
How to Run SQL Queries on your WordPress Database
Before getting into the examples , let ’s take a moment to check out how it is possible to run SQL queries on a WordPress website .
You have three possibilities :
Using SSH : If your WordPress hosting allows SSH connections , you can simply connect to your server and run the queries directly into your MySQL database .
: If your WordPress hosting allows SSH connections , you can simply connect to your server and run the queries directly into your MySQL database .
Using PHPMyAdmin : Most WordPress hosting packages come with cPanel and PHPMy Admin , a web interface that allows you to execute SQL queries .
: Most WordPress hosting packages come with cPanel and PHPMy Admin , a web interface that allows you to execute SQL queries .
Using a WordPress plugin : Database My Admin is a WordPress plugin that allows you to run any SQL queries against your WordPress database from within your WP dashboard .
If you do n’t want to manually run queries and just need to optimize your database , Advanced Database Cleaner might be a plugin to consider .
Clean Up Your WordPress Database From Weird Characters
Encoding problems can be really painful .
Instead of manually update all of your posts , here is a query that you can run in order to clean your database from weird characters .
Your WordPress site will be much more enjoyable to read for your visitors .
UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = REPLACE ( post_content , ' â€œ ' , ' “ ' ) ; UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = REPLACE ( post_content , ' â€ ' , ' ” ' ) ; UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = REPLACE ( post_content , ' â€™ ' , '’' ) ; UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = REPLACE ( post_content , ' â€˜ ' , '‘' ) ; UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = REPLACE ( post_content , 'â€ ” ' , ' – ' ) ; UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = REPLACE ( post_content , 'â€ “ ' , '— ' ) ; UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = REPLACE ( post_content , 'â€¢ ' , '-' ) ; UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = REPLACE ( post_content , ' â€¦ ' , '…' ) ; UPDATE wp_comments SET comment_content = REPLACE ( comment_content , 'â€œ ' , ' “ ' ) ; UPDATE wp_comments SET comment_content = REPLACE ( comment_content , 'â€ ' , ' ” ' ) ; UPDATE wp_comments SET comment_content = REPLACE ( comment_content , ' â€™ ' , '’' ) ; UPDATE wp_comments SET comment_content = REPLACE ( comment_content , ' â€˜ ' , '‘' ) ; UPDATE wp_comments SET comment_content = REPLACE ( comment_content , 'â€ ” ' , '– ' ) ; UPDATE wp_comments SET comment_content = REPLACE ( comment_content , 'â€ “ ' , '— ' ) ; UPDATE wp_comments SET comment_content = REPLACE ( comment_content , 'â€¢ ' , '-' ) ; UPDATE wp_comments SET comment_content = REPLACE ( comment_content , 'â€¦ ' , '… ' ) ;

Reset Administrator Password
WordPress security is n’t something to neglect , and passwords should be changed every once in a while to make sure that your WordPress website stays secure .
As user passwords are stored within the database , it is possible to reset them using a simple SQL query .
Simply modify the query below by replacing admin_username by the username of which you want to change the password .
new_password is the desired updated password .
UPDATE `wp_users` SET `user_pass` = MD5 ( ' new_password ' )
WHERE `wp_users`.`user_login` = " admin_username " ;
Note the use of MySQL ’s MD5 function , which creates an MD5 hash of the specified password .
WordPress security standards require that passwords are stored in the database as MD5 hashes .
If you recently switched your WordPress website or blog to HTTPS , you need to update hardcoded links within your articles .
This is a tedious task if you do it manually , but it will take you less than a minute if you use SQL queries to update all links contained within your content .
Simply update the query below by replacing yoursite.com by your URL , and run it .
UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = replace ( post_content , ' http://yoursite.com', ' https://yoursite.com');
Close Trackbacks On All Posts At Once
Do you use trackbacks and pings ?
Nowadays , most people seem to find them useless .
In order to get rid of them , you can close trackbacks manually , but this will consume a lot of time .
Or , of course , you can use a good old SQL query to perform a database cleaning , as shown below :
UPDATE wp_posts SET ping_status = ' closed ' ;
Spam is extremely common and if you chose to give your readers the ability to interact on your articles , there ’s no doubt that a lot of spam will be received .
Over the years , WordPress has drastically improved the way spam is handled .
If spam is detected , it is n’t displayed on your WordPress site straight away , but instead kept in a queue where you can choose whether to approve them or not .
If your spam queue is long , the fastest way to mass delete all spam comments is to run the following SQL query :
DELETE FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_approved = ' spam ' ;
Get Rid Of All Unused Shortcodes
WordPress shortcodes are very useful and make it easy to embed info in your articles without having to modify any of your WordPress themes .
Nowadays , a wide array of WordPress plugins offer shortcodes that can be used to integrate data within the WordPress editor .
But unused shortcodes can create readability problems :
Once you stop using a shortcode ( for example when you switch to another WordPress theme ) you ’ll find shortcodes in full text within your content .
Here ’s a SQL query to remove them .
Just update the code with the shortcode you want to remove .
I ’ve used [ tweet ] in this example .
UPDATE wp_post SET post_content = replace ( post_content , '[ tweet ] ' , '' ) ;
Post meta are data associated with a specific post .
For example , when you create a custom field , the data is stored as meta .
It can then be retrieved and displayed on your WordPress website .
If you used to add a specific custom field to your posts but do not need it anymore , you can perform this “ database cleaner ” query and remove the undesired post meta quickly and effortlessly .
DELETE FROM wp_postmeta WHERE meta_key = ' YourMetaKey ' ;

A decade ago , tags where very popular in blogging .
Nowadays , most bloggers and WordPress site owners stopped using them .
If you did , save some space on your database by cleaning it from unused tags .
DELETE FROM wp_terms WHERE term_id IN ( SELECT term_id FROM wp_term_taxonomy WHERE count = 0 ) ; DELETE FROM wp_term_taxonomy WHERE term_id not IN ( SELECT term_id FROM wp_terms ) ; DELETE FROM wp_term_relationships
WHERE term_taxonomy_id not IN ( SELECT term_taxonomy_id FROM wp_term_taxonomy ) ;
Delete Feed Cache
WordPress stores the feed cache in the wp_options table .
If you want to flush the feed cache , you can do so by using the following query :
DELETE FROM `wp_options` WHERE `option_name` LIKE ( ' _transient%_feed_ % ')
→ Source : https://wpengineer.com/2114/delete-all-feed-cache…
Optimize Your WordPress Database By Removing Transients
WordPress transients are basically a caching feature :
They are used to store any kind of data that takes a long time to get , and therefore are returned super fast the next time you need it .
While this is definitely a super useful feature , transients can take a lot of space in your database when left unmanaged , and reduce your WordPress website performance .
To perform an advanced database cleanup , use the query below :
DELETE FROM `wp_options` WHERE `option_name` LIKE ( ' % \_transient\_ % ' ) ;
It is totally safe to remove WordPress transients from time to time , as WordPress will recreate the needed transients .
Delete All Revisions And Their Metadata
Revisions are a very useful feature , but if you do n’t delete the many revisions from time to time your database will quickly become very big .
The following query deletes all revisions as well as all the metadata associated with the revisions .
DELETE a , b , c FROM wp_posts a WHERE a.post_type = ' revision ' LEFT JOIN wp_term_relationships b ON ( a.ID = b.object_id ) LEFT JOIN wp_postmeta c ON ( a. ID = c.post_id ) ;
→ Source : https://onextrapixel.com/13-useful-wordpress-sql-queries-you-wish-you-knew-earlier/
Batch Delete Old Posts
Sometimes , you might need to delete very old articles that are no longer relevant .
The following query will delete any article older than 600 days .
This value ( defined on line 3 ) can be replaced by any desired date in days .
If you want to make an even better version of this query , what about mixing it with the previous one in order to remove old posts as well as their metadata ?
DELETE FROM `wp_posts` WHERE `post_type` = ' post ' AND DATEDIFF ( NOW ( ) , `post_date` ) > 600
By default , when someone leaves a reply on your blog , WordPress saves the user agent in the database .
It can be useful for stats , but for 95 % of bloggers , it is just useless .
This query will replace the user agent with a blank string , which can reduce your database size if you have lots of replies .
update wp_comments set comment_agent ='' ;
All WordPress data is stored within database tables , which means that it can very easily be updated using SQL queries .
If you need to update the admin email , here is the query to do it .
UPDATE `wp_users` SET `user_email` = " new_email_address " WHERE `wp_users`.`user_login` = " admin " ;
Of course , this query can be used to update any email contained within your wp_users table .
Simply replace admin by the username of the account you want to change the email address .
Batch Disable All WordPress Plugins
It can happen that a faulty plugin breaks your WordPress site .
Even worst , depending on how serious the error is , you can end up being unable to access your wp_admin area where you could have been able to deactivate the WordPress plugin causing an error .
In that case , the best thing to do is to deactivate all the plugins using the following SQL query :
UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = '' WHERE option_name = ' active_plugins ';
Most likely , this will solve the error and allow you to log back into your WP dashboard , where you can re-activate plugins one by one and identify which one was causing problems .
Switch WordPress
Themes using SQL
WordPress stores your site settings within the wp_options database table .
Therefore , your active WordPress theme can be modified using a simple SQL query .
This can be very useful if your active theme has an error which prevents you to access your admin dashboard .
The following query will restore WordPress ’ Twenty Nineteen as the active theme .
UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = ' twentynineteen ' WHERE option_name = ' template ' or option_name = ' stylesheet ' ;
Change Author Attribution On All Posts At Once
Do you need to change author attribution on many posts ?
If yes , you do n’t have to do it manually .
Here ’s a handy query to do the job for you .
The first thing to do is to retrieve the IDs of WordPress users .
Once logged into MySQL , use the following SQL query to get a list of users , as well as their IDs :
SELECT ID , display_name FROM wp_users ;
Let ’s consider that NEW_AUTHOR_ID is the ID of the new author , and OLD_AUTHOR_ID is the old author ID .
Run this query to assign a new author to all articles currently assigned to OLD_AUTHOR_ID .
UPDATE wp_posts SET post_author=NEW_AUTHOR_ID
WHERE post_author=OLD_AUTHOR_ID ;
Once this query has been executed , all posts from the old author now appear to have been written by the new author .
Frequently Asked Questions
How Safe It Is To Run Those Queries On a Live Site ?
All the above queries have been tested and are totally safe .
That being said , there ’s no way to go back when a SQL query has been executed .
For this reason , you should always have a fresh backup of your database .
This can be done by using a WordPress plugin like WP Database Backup or by using backups provided by your WordPress hosting .
Can I use WordPress Plugins Instead of Running Queries ?
Of course .
Many WordPress plugins provide advanced cleaning options for WordPress databases .
Advanced Database Cleaner is probably the most popular WordPress plugin for database optimization and performance .

Sue Lowden files for U.S. Senate seat to battle Harry Reid
Sun Coverage Sun politics coverage
Sue Lowden formally filed for the GOP nomination for the U.S. Senate today , vowing that if elected she intends to cut taxes to create more jobs .
Lowden , 58 , also questioned if Nevada is getting its fair share of federal money back with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid representing the state .
" If we give a dollar to Washington , we 're getting 65 cents back with Harry Reid .
So I would ask you if that is our fair share , " she said at a news conference .
She questioned whether some of that money being returned to Nevada is " pork . "
There are three freshman senators - from Alaska , Idaho and North Carolina - " who dollar - for - dollar are bringing more money in their states than Harry Reid is . "
" So what influence are we talking about ? " she said , referring to Reid 's position as majority leader .
Jobs are the most important issue now , she said .
" I intend to go in and start cutting taxes , cutting the payroll tax , cutting the corporate tax , capital gains would be zero in my world . "
" A big different between me and Harry Reid is that I would make the death tax exemption permanent , " she said .
" And you will see it come back next year if he is your United States senator . "
Reid 's team said the senator brings home more federal money for Nevada than any other lawmaker and doubts Lowden could do any better .
" It 's highly disingenuous because she 's running a campaign saying she wo n't fight to bring home any federal money - she says no earmarks , " said Reid spokesman Jon Summers .
" Senator Reid brings home more for Nevada than the rest of the federal delegation combined , " he said .
Lowden 's campaign warchest for the Republican primary on June 8 is $ 2.5 million .
Asked what she accomplished in her one term in the Nevada Senate , she said the state - run workers compensation system was bankrupt in 1993 .
" We changed it into a privatized system . "
It gave companies an option to buy different sorts of workers compensation including going self insured , Lowden said .
Businesses in part are attracted today to Nevada because of the workers compensation system that is still mainly in effect , Lowden said .
If Obama 's election night was a rising up of America 's better nature , his triumph in healthcare reform was a victory after years of Republican obstructionism .
Ours is an essentially good - hearted nation , but so deeply divided that wedge issues can decide a campaign outcome .
When I 've blogged in favour of universal healthcare , I 've been stunned not so much by the vitriol of comments against it , but by the ignorance .
The same lies and wild rumours , gleaned from far - right sites , are repeated mindlessly .
I spent months between 2006 and 2009 in hospitals receiving treatment for cancer of the mandible .
I had four scheduled surgeries , several emergency surgeries , and went through four physical rehabilitations after tissue was moved here and there on my poor harvested frame .
I received excellent care .
I had good employer health insurance .
Otherwise we would have been wiped out .
None but the very rich can afford to get seriously ill in America and hope to pay for it themselves .
Yet opponents of reform were selfish : why should they pay for those too stupid , lazy , etc , to provide for themselves ?
They feared government would control healthcare .
What did they think insurance companies were doing ?
The day of the vote was surrealistic , exposing the unwholesome underpinnings of the anti-Obama Tea Party movement .
Forming a gauntlet for congressmen to run , demonstrators shouted the n-word and spat at black congressmen .
I doubt Sarah Palin will choose to speak at their next convention .
Now Republicans face the destruction of their party over their stonewalling against reform .
Bush 's speechwriter David Frum blogged : " It 's hard to exaggerate the magnitude of the disaster .
We followed the most radical voices in the party , and they led us to abject and irreversible defeat . "
Those radical voices coined the term " Obamacare . "
So it will long be known .

Via : Asia Times :
By 2014 , International Monetary Fund official John Lipsky remarked March 21 , the debt - to - gross domestic product ( GDP ) ratio of the Group of Seven countries will reach 100 % , and the governments of the industrial world will carry the highest debt burden since shortly after the end of World War II .
That is bad news ; worse news is that governments are shoveling money into the world banking system to finance the debt expansion .
Following the great bank bailout of 2008 , the global banking system is socialized de facto , shifting its resources towards government debt and away from private sector financing .
Governments averted a financial apocalypse in 2009 by bailing out the bankrupt banking system .
But who will bail out the governments ?
The answer for the time being is that they will bail themselves out at the expense of the private economy .
In the post - apocalyptic financial world , private banks have turned into flesh - eating zombies that cannibalize the private economy in order to finance government borrowing requirements not seen since World War II .
…
Note that the central banks of the world have not increased their holdings of US government securities to a significant extent .
Their net purchases are running at a modest $ 20 billion a month , or an annual rate of $ 240 billion .
The US Treasury has become dependent on global private banks .
According to Treasury data , $ 108 billion of the $ 180 billion in net foreign purchases of US Treasury securities during the three months through January came from London and the Cayman Islands .
…
Where are the banks getting the money to lend to the US government ?
From the US government itself .
The Federal Reserve has increased bank reserves by $ 1.4 trillion since the beginning of the crisis , feeding funds into the banking system which the banks immediately lend back to the government , along with $ 300 billion of additional funds freed up by the reduction in loans to the private sector .

A top Google executive on Wednesday called for rules to put pressure on governments that filter the Internet , saying the practice was hindering international trade .
Alan Davidson , director of public policy for Google , told a joint Congressional panel that the United States should consider withholding development aid for countries that restrict certain Web sites .
He said censorship had become more than a human rights issue and was hurting profit for foreign companies that rely on the Internet to reach customers .
“ The growing problem for Internet censorship is not isolated to one country or one region , ” Mr. Davidson told the Congressional - Executive Commission on China .
“ No single company and no single industry can tackle Internet censorship on its own . ”
The fallout from China ’s restrictive Internet policies widened on Wednesday when officials from Go Daddy Group , an Internet services company , told the commission that the company would halt registration of Chinese domain names .

Thoughts :
Obviously , the news that Joe Nathan will be undergoing Tommy John Surgery creates a big hole in the backend of the Twins bullpen .
They ’ll likely try to fill the void with a myriad of middle relievers , but the long - term solution could be sitting at Triple - A ( click here for our look at John Slama from yesterday ) .
Huston Street ’s injury cost him his Top 10 spot , but with good news coming from the MRI he should n’t be expected to miss much time .
Do n’t drop him far down your draft board .
The other closer injury news is Kerry Wood .
Of course , nothing changes on this list because of it due to him not being a Top 15 closer , but it ’s still worth noting .
Chris Perez becomes a good source of saves over the first month or two of the season ( or potentially beyond ) if you are in need of some help there .

Electronic
Arts plans to offer extended downloadable demos for a price to players prior to the release of the full , packaged game , according to analyst Michael Pachter 's latest investor report .
EA 's Chief Operating Officer Nick Earl revealed the company 's latest premium downloadable content ( PDLC ) strategy during a recent investor visit at its Redwood City studio , which includes charging a small price for an early look at upcoming titles .
" The PDLC would be sold for $ 10 or $ 15 through Xbox Live and PlayStation Network , and would essentially be a very long game demo , along the lines of 2009's Battlefield 1943 , " Pachter said .
" A full - blown packaged game would follow shortly after the release of the PDLC , bearing a full retail price .
Mr. Earl believes that the release of the PDLC first limits the risk of completing and marketing the full packaged version , and serves as a low - cost marketing tool .
"
In a follow - up conversation with IGN , Pachter says these paid " demos " will act as a sort of beta test for the company , saying feedback received will shape the final retail product .
" Think about Battlefield 1943 as the prototype , so a full ( but short ) game experience for a reasonable price , " he said .
" At the same time , an expanded version of the game will be under development for release as a packaged product . "
" However , the idea is that if the PDLC gets favorable reviews , it will build word of mouth for the boxed product .
If the PDLC has issues , they can tweak the packaged product to address those issues , improving the final product before release , " he added .
Pachter said he was n't sure if EA plans to include the PDLC content with the packaged game , adding that the content could be a " prequel " to the full game so it can continue to be sold separately .
The strategy is expected to launch during the company 's fiscal 2011 year , which begins on April 1 , 2010 . : Electronic Arts has responded to Pachter 's report .
The company told IGN it has not officially announced any pricing details for any projects , and that traditional game demos will remain free .
" EA is working on a number of projects for delivering premium content to consumers before , during , and after the launch of a packaged - goods version of the game , " said Jeff Brown , VP of Corporate Communications .
" EA SPORTS , EA Games and EA Play are each experimenting with download strategies that deliver fresh game content in formats players want to experience . "
" To date , there is no set pricing strategy for the entire EA portfolio .
And many of the proposals include free - to - play content on models similar to Madden Ultimate Team , Battlefield Heroes and Battlefield 1943 , " he added .
" None of the proposals call for charging consumers for traditionally free game demos . "

Indeed , one could say Middle East politics today is a struggle between 1977 and 1979  and 1979 is still winning .
How so ?
Following the defeat of Egypt and other Arab armies by Israel in the 1967 war , Nasserism , a k a Arab nationalism , the abiding ideology of the day , was demolished .
In its wake came two broad alternatives :
The first , manifested by President Anwar Sadat of Egypt in his 1977 trip to Israel , was a bid to cast the Arab world ’s future with the West , economic liberalization , modernization and acceptance of Israel .
The weakness of “ Sadatism , ” though , was that it was an elite ideology with no cultural roots .
The Egyptian state made peace with Israel , but Arab societies never followed .
The second Arab - Muslim response emerged in 1979 .
To start , there was the takeover that year of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Islamist extremists who challenged the religious credentials of the Saudi ruling family .
The Saudi rulers responded by forging a new bargain with their Islamists :
Let us stay in power and we will give you a free hand in setting social norms , relations between the sexes and religious education inside Saudi Arabia  and abundant resources to spread Sunni Wahabi fundamentalism abroad .
The Saudi lurch backward coincided with Iran ’s revolution in 1979 , which brought Ayatollah Khomeini to power .
That revolution set up a competition between Shiite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia for who was the real leader of the Muslim world , and it triggered a surge in oil prices that gave both fundamentalist regimes the resources to export their brands of puritanical Islam , through mosques and schools , farther than ever .
Greg Sargent reports :
Senator Bernie Sanders , in a brief interview in the Capitol just now , confirmed to me that he ’s willing to commit to introducing an amendment that would add the public option to the Senate bill ’s reconciliation fix .
This is important , because as far fetched as this seems , if this amendment is introduced , a vote on it would be very hard for the Senate Dem leadership to block .
The only thing that could stop it from happening , according to Senate expert Robert Dove , is for the parliamentarian to rule that it ’s not germane to the Senate bill somehow — something that seems unlikely ... read on
As Adam Green is launching another initiative for the PCCC , we know the House does n't trust the Senate at all , but the process seems to finally be winding down .
Ryan Grim reports that the public option is still viable , but he says it 's a matter of will and not votes .
The public option faces its last stand .
With more than 40 senators publicly willing to vote for a health care reform reconciliation package that includes the option , the opportunity to reinsert it into the final bill has never been greater , though the battle is nearly over without having been fought .
--
That balance of power gives House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) extraordinary leverage of a historical nature .
Pelosi , however , has yet to concede in negotiations that it is the obligation of the House to go first .
And the deal that is being reached is driven largely by the White House .
But both the Senate and the White House need Pelosi .
And the House , of course , has already passed a health care bill with a public option .
If the House does move first , the Senate would essentially face an up - or - down vote on whatever Pelosi sends over .
Durbin was asked by HuffPost if he would whip a reconciliation package from the House that included a public option .
An analysis of past statements and positions taken by members of the Democratic caucus indicates that there could plausibly be 53 votes for a public option and perhaps several more .
Durbin , in response to the question , said at first that it was hypothetical , but then answered , " I think there will come a time when we reach agreement on what the reconciliation package includes , with the understanding that any changes in the House or Senate could slow down or stop the process . "
So whatever comes from the House , that 's what you will whip ?
" That 's basically it , " he said .
" I hope that what comes from the House is what we agree on going into this debate . "
-- UPDATE : The news that the Senate parliamentarian told Senate Republicans that the bill must become law before any amendments can be made through reconciliation alters the equation if true .
The House , however , could still pass the Senate bill into law and then send the Senate a reconciliation fix with a public option .
The Senate could torpedo that legislation without concern that no reform package at all would get passed , giving the Senate added leverage .
The underlying dynamic , however , remains unchanged :
In the next few days , as the White House and congressional leaders meet to hash out the way forward , the votes appear to exist to include a public option .
It 's only a matter of will .
It appears that Dick Durbin is not going to risk the entire bill because of the public option .
Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill. ) acknowledged Wednesday that liberals may be asked to oppose any amendment , including one creating a public option , to ensure a smooth ride for the bill .
“ We have to tell people , ‘ You just have to swallow hard ’ and say that putting an amendment on this is either going to stop it or slow it down , and we just ca n’t let it happen , ” Durbin , who supports a public option , told reporters .
“ We have to move this forward .
We know the Republicans are likely to offer a lot of amendments , and some of them may be appealing to Democrats , but we have to urge them to stick with the bill . ”
The PCCC is running a campaign against Durbin at this time and asking members of the Senate to not turn their back on it .
__1454 : __ Amerigo Vespucci is born in Florence , Italy .
He 'll give his name to two continents .
Vespucci , the son of a notary , went to work for the Medici banking house .
They dispatched him as an agent to Seville , Spain , where he arranged the fitting out of ships and the trading of their cargoes .
He seems to have been in Seville when another Italian in Spain , Christopher Columbus , returned to the nearby port of Cadiz from his first journey to the West Indies .
Vespucci later helped Columbus prepare his vessels for the Genoese mariner 's second and third voyages of discovery .
Not content to sit on the sidelines when fame and fortune were in the offing , Vespucci arranged for and outfitted his own expeditions to seek a short trade route to India .
Vespucci set sail in 1499 and explored the northern coast of what we now call South America .
Because he was looking for India , he called the local waters there the " Gulf of the Ganges . "
On his second voyage , Vespucci made a major breakthrough .
He followed the eastern coast of the new land south , and south and farther south .
He was in fact off the coast of Patagonia , within 400 miles of Tierra del Fuego .
The coast was like nothing previously known to Europeans .
Vespucci was convinced it was n't Asia at all , but a new world entirely .
Vespucci made one or perhaps two additional voyages to what some were soon calling the New World .
A popular account of Vespucci 's journeys appeared in a pamphlet , " The Four Voyages of Amerigo . "
It received widespread circulation , thanks to the growth of a relatively new technology , the printing press .
Martin Waldseemüller , a modernist - humanist German clergyman and cartographer , reprinted " The Four Voyages of Amerigo " in 1507 with his own " Cosmographic Introduction . "
He opined :
I see no reason why anyone should justly object to calling this part ... America , after Amerigo [ Vespucci ] , its discoverer , a man of great ability .
Waldseemüller included a map of the new lands , on which the name " America " makes its earliest appearance .
The map was popular .
The name caught on , and it stuck .
And it spread .
America was first used as a name for only the southern continent of the New World , but Gerardus Mercator 's 1538 world map included both North America and South America .
Vespucci died in Seville in 1512 .
Though he reached America after Columbus ( and others ) , it is not unjust that two continents are named in his honor .
He does seem to have originated the idea that the new lands were not merely offshore islands of Asia .
He reorganized the data , he shifted the paradigm , he deserves the eponym .
So , half a millennium later , the meme lives on .
We do not often refer to the New World as Columbia – except in patriotic song and the name of the U.S. national capital .
Nor do we call it Ericsonia or Cabotland .
Nor is our nation 's name ( and we should be grateful for this ) Waldseemüller or the United States of Vespucci .

On the day the US Congress passed legislation providing health coverage to 32 million Americans without insurance , Political Scrapbook can reveal the Conservatives ’ Cash Gordon campaign was developed by an anti-healthcare lobbyist described as “ Karl Rove 2.0 ” .

In an embarrassment for CCHQ , the party ’s flagship campaign is currently hosted alongside those attempting to “ rescue America from government - run health care ” , including NotSoSure.org and Hands Off .
Another site rails against homosexuals in the armed forces , stating the military “ should not be used as a tool to advance the goals of gay activist groups ” .

Bill Paxton Pinball ( BPP ) started long ago , in the distant yesteryear of 2005 .
At the time I was collecting parts to build my Neo Geo custom arcade cabinet and I had these thoughts :
Hey , it would be cool to have a pinball machine !
I should build my own , it would be a interesting challenge .
What would the theme be ?
Ah! Bill Paxton Pinball .
Swish , done .
That took about one total minute of thinking .
I then began my quest …
Aside from some random doodlings for a backbox design , I started by by lasering a 64 x 8 frame in which to mount ( by hand ) 512 standard - sized red LED’s .
This may seem insane , and yeah , I guess it was , but I really wanted this thing to be as custom and hard - core as possible .
Plus LED matrix segments are actually kind of expensive .
I had actually started experimenting with LED matrix displays even back when I did the Neo Geo cabinet in 2005 .
Check out the story here and notice the “ coin counter ” I added .
One of the very first test circuits for Bill Paxton Pinball , circa 2005 .
I could n’t even find 7 matching LED ’s back then !
My very first idea was to use a Basic Stamp to run the display itself .
Keep in mind the Propeller was fairly new at this time and I was really only familiar with the ‘ Stamp .
The original design called for a series of multiplexers to address the display column / row and an external RAM / EEPROM to hold the display / animation .
The idea was the ‘ Stamp would only refresh it when need be , otherwise a binary counter would just “ rake ” the data from the IC ’s to the display .
Always keep your Atari 800 handy , no matter what project you ’re working on .
This idea sort of worked but not really as well as I wanted .
Plus by this time even though I was using the much - faster Propeller it still was n’t fast enough for a flicker - free display , at least without machine language ( which I was n’t using at that time ) SPIN is fast but not enough to refresh a 64 column display fast enough to be both bright and flicker - free .
Above is a simple test where a value is multiplied on every column and sent to the display .
As you can see it ’s a lot dimmer than the final product since it ’s being erased and redrawn over and over .
What I ended up doing was putting an 8 bit shift register on every column of the display so the display itself was the memory .
Data is shifted in , 1 or 0 , 512 times per cycle and the display remains in that state until rewritten .
Replacing the multiplexers with shift registers ( and nearly doubling the cost of the display )
This allows full control of the display with only 3 wires : data , clock and latch .
Also you can create a scrolling effect by latching it every 8 clocks .
Additional bit - shifting code allows the display to be scrolled up and down .
Looking back now it would have been easier to use resistors as the “ wire bridge ” in the above photo but hey – as long as I ’ve still got teeth I ’ve got great wire strippers .
By time this I was using the Parallax Propeller , as previously mentioned .
The first code I wrote for BPP was the display driver .
Although the Propeller has a built - in character set I had to make my own to fit the ratio of the display .
( Looking back now I wish I had done a 64 x 16 matrix , oh well )
The character set goes from 0 ( zero ) to Z and is ASCII - aligned .
Therefore a SPACE is “ ; ” since SPACE in ASCI is 32 , I did n’t want to add 8 useless characters between that and “ zero ” ( 40 ) .
RAM was n’t tight at first but it was near the end !
The display driver can do the following :
Display score ( static , scroll in from top , scroll in from bottom )
Single - frame message ( static or scroll in a specified speed )
Scrolling message ( can be as long as you wish with variable scroll speed )
Direct memory - to - display output ( used with animation driver )
Commands for the display are sent from the main game kernel in forms such as this :
fr.scroll( string ( “ HIGH ;SCORE;CLEARED ” ) , 1_000_000 )
whereas 1_000_000 is the number of clocks per column of scroll
fr.static ( string ( “ INSERT;COIN ” ) ,0 )
whereas 0 indicates not to scroll this onto screen , just stick it there .
ScoreLoop ( 16 )
whereas 16 indicates to start the score at +16 pixels ( off the bottom of the screen ) at which point it will scroll up to center .
ScoreLoop ( 8 ) would just display the score in the middle , no scrolling .
( You can download the entire source code for reference , see Part 3 of this story )
Next up was animation .
The first trick was to analyze the file structure of a 64 x 8 1 bit ( black & white ) Windows bitmap , using a binary viewer .
A bitmap starts with the bottom left pixel , goes to the right , then up a line and over again .
This in no way translates to how my display memory is arranged , as the example photo above shows .
I did a test pattern in the bitmap file so I could identify how the pixels were laid out in the bytes .
I wrote some code to flip the bits and make the bitmap appear on the screen off an SD card , as seen in the video above .
It worked but was kind of slow , well , the bit operations at least .
The ultimate solution was to write a separate program that reads a sequence of bitmaps off the SD card , rearranges the bits , then stores them in the spare 32 k of the Propeller ’s EEPROM in the same sequence as my display uses .
These can then be loaded quickly into the frame buffer and displayed at will during the game .
Next up was mounting everything in the backbox ( sometimes called “ head ” ) of the unit .
I had designed & printed the translite back in spring of 2008 , so I had that ready .
For illumination I used a cheapy fluorescent bulb package from Menard’s .
Not shown here , but I actually ended up painting over the lamp to make the display a bit dimmer so it would n’t reflect as much on the glass .
Oh well , rookie mistake .
The backbox with all artwork and display .
You can see the cable coming into the cabinet in the back .
It contains : AC power for lamp , audio , data for display and display power ( +3.3 volts )
Spot the differences !
It ’s just like one of those lame MegaTouch games !
The translite was actually done with 2 separate translucent prints placed atop each other .
This creates richer colors and deeper blacks .
It ’s a similar method to movie posters that are printed in reverse on the back to ensure high quality .
Also , one of the prints had certain areas “ knocked out ” so those spots would appear a bit brighter on the board .
In the next section we ’ll discuss building the cabinet and iterations of the playfield itself …

Life After Growth
By Richard Heinberg
04 March , 2010
Postcarbon.org
What if the economy does n't recover ?
In 2008 the U.S. economy tripped down a steep , rocky slope .
Employment levels plummeted ; so did purchases of autos and other consumer goods .
Property values crashed ; foreclosure and bankruptcy rates bled .
For states , counties , cities , and towns ; for manufacturers , retailers , and middle - and low - income families , the consequences were — and continue to be — catastrophic .
Other nations were soon caught up in the undertow .
In late 2009 and early 2010 , the economy showed some signs of renewed vigor .
Understandably , everyone wants it to get " back to normal . "
But here 's a disturbing thought :
What if that is not possible ?
What if the goalposts have been moved , the rules rewritten , the game changed ?
What if the decades - long era of economic growth based on ever - increasing rates of resource extraction , manufacturing , and consumption is over , finished , and done ?
What if the economic conditions that all of us grew up expecting to continue practically forever were merely a blip on history 's timeline ?
It 's an uncomfortable idea , but one that cannot be ignored :
The " normal " late - 20th century economy of seemingly endless growth actually emerged from an aberrant set of conditions that cannot be perpetuated .
That " normal " is gone .
One way or another , a " new normal " will emerge to replace it .
Can we build a different , more sustainable economy to replace the one now in tatters ?
Let 's be clear : I believe we are in for some very hard times .
The transitional period on our way toward a post - growth , equilibrium economy will prove to be the most challenging time any of us has ever lived through .
Nevertheless , I am convinced that we can survive this collective journey , and that if we make sound choices as families and communities , life can actually be better for us in the decades ahead than it was during the heady days of seemingly endless economic expansion .
In this essay , I would like to share my conclusions on this subject and the process by which I arrived at them .
It 's a bit of a long story , so please bear with me .
First , the conclusions .
Four Propositions
The following summary statements are fundamental both to grasping our current situation and managing our way toward a desirable future :
1 . We have reached the end of economic growth as we have known it .
The " growth " we are talking about consists of the expansion of the overall size of the economy ( with more people being served and more money changing hands ) and of the quantities of energy and material goods flowing through it .
The economic crisis that began in 2008 was both foreseeable and inevitable , and that it marks a permanent , fundamental break from past decades — a period in which economists adopted the unrealistic view that perpetual economic growth is necessary and also possible to achieve .
As we will see , there are fundamental constraints to ongoing economic expansion , and the world is beginning to encounter those constraints .
This is not to say the U.S. or the world will never see another quarter or year of growth relative to the previous year .
Rather , the point is that when the bumps are averaged out , the general trend - line of the economy ( measured in terms of production and consumption of real goods ) will be level or downward rather than upward from now on .
2 . The basic factors that will inevitably shape whatever replaces the growth economy are knowable .
To survive and thrive for long , societies have to operate within the planet 's budget of sustainably extractable resources .
This means that even if we do n't know exactly what a desirable post - growth economy and lifestyle will look like , we know enough to begin working toward them .
3 . It is possible for economies to persist for centuries or millennia with no or minimal growth .
That is how most economies operated until recent times .
If billions of people through countless generations lived without economic growth , we can do so as well — now and far into the future .
The end of growth does not mean the end of the world .
4 . Life in a non-growing economy can be fulfilling , interesting , and secure .
The absence of growth does not imply a lack of change or improvement .
Within a non-growing or equilibrium economy there can still be a continuous development of practical skills , artistic expression , and technology .
In fact , some historians and social scientists argue that life in an equilibrium economy can be superior to life in a fast - growing economy : while growth creates opportunities for some , it also typically intensifies competition — there are big winners and big losers , and ( as in most boom towns ) the quality of relations within the community can suffer as a result .
Within a non-growing economy it is possible to maximize benefits and reduce factors leading to decay , but doing so will require pursuing appropriate goals : instead of more , we must strive for better ; rather than promoting increased economic activity for its own sake , we must emphasize whatever increases quality of life without stoking consumption .
One way to do this is to reinvent and redefine growth itself .
The transition to a no - growth economy ( or one in which growth is defined in a fundamentally different way ) is inevitable , but it will go much better if we plan for it rather than simply watching in dismay as institutions we have come to rely upon fail , and then try to improvise a survival strategy in their absence .
In effect , we have to create a desirable " new normal " that fits the constraints imposed by depleting natural resources .
Maintaining the " old normal " is not an option ; if we do not find new goals for ourselves and plan our transition from a growth - based economy to a healthy equilibrium economy , we will by default create a much less desirable " new normal " whose emergence we are already beginning to see in the forms of persistent high unemployment , a widening gap between rich and poor , and ever more frequent and worsening financial and environmental crises — all of which translate to profound distress for individuals , families , and communities .
' Limits to Growth '
The journey that led to my formulating these propositions began in 1972 , when a book called Limits to Growth was making headlines .
This relatively compact volume , which went on to become the best - selling environmental book of all time , provoked the first Great Wake - up Call of my adult life , changing the course of everything I have thought and done ever since .
Let me explain why Limits to Growth impacted me so deeply .
That book , which reported on the first attempts to use computers to model the likely interactions between trends in resources , consumption , and population , was also the first major scientific study to question the assumption that economic growth can and will continue more or less uninterrupted into the foreseeable future .
The idea was heretical at the time — and still is : during the past few decades , growth has become virtually the sole index of national economic well - being .
When the economy grows , jobs appear , investments yield high returns , and everyone is happy .
When the economy stops growing , financial bloodletting ensues .
And so predictably a book saying that growth cannot and will not continue beyond a certain point proved profoundly upsetting in some quarters , and soon Limits to Growth was prominently " debunked " by public relations efforts organized by pro-growth business interests .
In reality , this " debunking " merely amounted to taking a few numbers in the book completely out of context , citing them as " predictions " ( which they explicitly were not ) , and then claiming that these predictions had failed .
The ruse was quickly exposed , but rebuttals often do n't gain nearly as much publicity as accusations , and so today millions of people mistakenly believe that the book was long ago discredited .
In fact , the original Limits to Growth scenarios have held up quite well *.
In principle , the argument for eventual limits to growth is a slam - dunk .
If any quantity grows steadily by a certain fixed percentage per year , this implies that it will double in size every so - many years ; the higher the percentage growth rate , the quicker the doubling .
A rough method of figuring doubling times is known as the rule of 70 : dividing the percentage growth rate into 70 gives the approximate time required for the initial quantity to double .
If a quantity is growing at 1 percent per year , it will double in 70 years ; at 2 percent per year growth , it will double in 35 years ; at 5 percent growth , it will double in only 14 years , and so on .
If you want to be more precise , you can use the Y^x button on your calculator , but the rule of 70 works fine for most purposes .
Here 's a real - world example :
Over the past two centuries , human population has grown at rates ranging from less than one percent to more than two percent per year .
In 1800 , world population stood at about one billion ; by 1930 it had doubled to two billion .
Only 30 years later ( in 1960 ) it had doubled again to four billion ; currently we are on track to achieve a third doubling , to eight billion humans , around 2025 .
No one seriously expects human population to continue growing for centuries into the future .
But imagine if it did — at just 1.3 percent per year ( its growth rate in the year 2000 ) .
By the year 2780 there would be 148 trillion humans on Earth — one person for each square meter of land on the planet 's surface .
It wo n't happen , of course .
In nature , growth always slams up against non-negotiable constraints sooner or later .
If a species finds that its food source has expanded , its numbers will increase to take advantage of those surplus calories — but then its food source will become depleted as more mouths consume it , and its predators will likewise become more numerous ( more tasty meals for them ! ) .
Population " blooms " ( that is , periods of rapid growth ) are always followed by crashes and die - offs .
Always .
Here 's another real - world example .
In recent years China 's economy has been growing at eight percent or more per year ; that means it is more than doubling in size every ten years .
Indeed , China consumes more than twice as much coal as it did a decade ago — the same with iron ore and oil .
The nation now has four times as many highways as it did , and almost five times as many cars .
How long can this go on ?
How many more doublings can occur before China has used up its key resources — or has simply decided that enough is enough and has stopped growing ?
It makes sense that economies should follow rules analogous to those that govern biological systems .
Plants and animals tend to grow quickly when they are young , but then they reach a more or less stable mature size .
In organisms , growth rates are largely controlled by genes .
In economies , growth seems tied to factors such as the availability of resources — chiefly energy resources ( " food " for the industrial system ) .
During the 20th century , cheap and abundant fossil fuels enabled rapid economic expansion ; at some point , therefore , fossil fuel depletion could put a brake on growth .
It is also possible that industrial wastes could accumulate to the point that the biological systems that underpin economic activity ( such as forests , crops , and human bodies ) begin to fail .
But economists generally do n't see things this way .
That 's probably because most current economic theories were formulated during an anomalous historical period of sustained growth .
Economists are merely generalizing from their experience : they can point to decades of steady growth in the recent past , and so they simply project that experience into the future .
Moreover , they have ways to explain why modern market economies are immune to the kinds of limits that constrain natural systems ; the two main ones concern substitution and efficiency .
If a useful resource becomes scarce , its price will rise , and this creates an incentive for users of the resource to find a substitute .
For example , if oil gets expensive enough , energy companies might start making liquid fuels from coal .
Or they might develop other energy sources undreamed of today .
Economists theorize that this process of substitution can go on forever .
It 's part of the magic of the free market .
Increasing efficiency means doing more with less .
In the U.S. , the number of inflation - adjusted dollars generated in the economy for every unit of energy consumed has increased steadily over recent decades ( the amount of energy , in British Thermal Units , required to produce a dollar of GDP has been dropping steadily , from close to 20,000 BTU per dollar in 1949 to 8,500 BTU in 2008 ) .
That 's one kind of economic efficiency .
Another has to do with locating the cheapest sources of materials , and the places where workers will be most productive and work for the lowest wages .
As we increase efficiency , we use less — of either resources or money — to do more .
That enables more growth .
Finding substitutes for depleting resources and upping efficiency are undeniably effective adaptive strategies of market economies .
Nevertheless , the question remains open as to how long these strategies can continue to work in the real world — which is governed less by economic theories than by the laws of physics .
In the real world , some things do n't have substitutes , or the substitutes are too expensive , or do n't work as well , or can't be produced fast enough .
And efficiency follows a law of diminishing returns : the first gains in efficiency are usually cheap , but every further incremental gain tends to cost more , until further gains become prohibitively expensive .
Unlike economists , most physical scientists recognize that growth within any functioning , bounded system has to stop sometime .
But this discussion has very real implications , because the economy is not just an abstract concept ; it is what determines whether we live in luxury or poverty ; whether we eat or starve .
If economic growth ends , everyone will be impacted , and it will take society years to adapt to this new condition .
Therefore it is important to be able to forecast whether that moment is close or distant in time .
Hence the Limits to Growth study .
The authors fed in data for world population growth , consumption trends , and the abundance of various important resources , ran their computer program , and concluded that the end of growth would probably arrive between 2010 and 2050 .
Industrial output and food production would then fall , leading to a decline in population .
( By the way , the Limits to Growth scenario study has been re-run repeatedly in the years since the original publication , using more sophisticated software and updated input data .
The results were similar .
See Limits to Growth : The 30 - Year Update . )
My Personal Story of Waking Up to Limits
That 's why Limits to Growth meant so much to me when I encountered it at age 21 .
I realized that the world in which I had been born , raised , and educated was headed toward what is politely known as a " historical discontinuity , " but more colloquially termed " collapse , " " a cliff , " or " a brick wall . "
Millions of young people today are having the same experience as they learn about climate change .
Welcome to the club .
At the time , I had been trying to make my way as a young musician .
My father had been a chemistry and physics teacher , but I had gravitated toward the arts : after being trained as a classical violinist , I had taught myself also to play electric guitar .
As I absorbed the implications of Limits to Growth , I realized that there were more important things than band rehearsals and gigs to attend to , so I mostly left the music business ( though I continue to be an avid amateur violinist ) and began looking for ways to help shift society toward a more sustainable path .
I became a freelance writer - editor and started pursuing projects I thought might lead me toward a better understanding of global trends and of how our species might avert an overwhelming economic and environmental disaster .
It was clear that society would need to undertake fundamental changes .
But what were those changes , exactly ?
I thought the best way to find out would be to form an intentional community as a kind of social laboratory in which to explore alternatives in energy , food production , and lifestyles .
I ended up spending most of the next 20 years living in three communities — one in Toronto that I helped establish , and others in Colorado and southern California that had already been going for some time before I joined .
Intentional communities ( sometimes also known as communes , with many now thriving under the banner of " eco-villages " ) are a fascinating social phenomenon , and hundreds still flourish worldwide .
By the early 1990s , I was eager to reconnect with mainstream society and bring what I had learned to a wider audience .
My wife , Janet Barocco , and I had met in an intentional community in southern California ; together we moved to a suburban home in Santa Rosa .
By the latter years of the decade I was teaching in a college program on sustainability that I had helped initiate and design , while also continuing to make my way as a freelance environmental writer .
It was at this point , in 1998 , that I heard a second Great Wake - up Call .
Peak Oil
It came in the form of an article in Scientific American by veteran petroleum geologists Colin Campbell and Jean Laherrère ( both of whom had overseen exploration and production in major oil companies ) , explaining why world oil extraction would reach a maximum around 2010 and begin its permanent decline thereafter .
I quickly realized that Peak Oil would likely be the first non-negotiable global limit to growth .
The hazy forecast that industrial society would hit a wall sometime in the 21st century was suddenly focused to a painful specificity .
Growth had acquired a hard expiration date .
Of course , oil does not pose our only societal limit , or even the most important one in the bigger scheme of things : climate , water , and topsoil are clearly more crucial in the long run .
But the peaking of world oil production could potentially bring modern industrial civilization to its knees , while also undercutting coordinated efforts to deal with all sorts of other problems .
Up to this point I had little interest in the subject of oil , or energy generally .
However , as I re-read the Scientific American article , I realized the pivotal role petroleum plays in the modern world — in transportation , agriculture , and the chemicals and materials industries .
I began spending hours each day studying energy history and oil production statistics .
I soon realized that the Industrial Revolution was really the Fossil Fuel Revolution , and that our modern food system is based on cheap fossil energy .
Further , the entire phenomenon of continuous economic growth — including the development of the financial institutions that facilitate growth , such as fractional reserve banking and the marketing of derivatives — is ultimately based on ever - increasing supplies of cheap energy .
Growth requires more manufacturing , more trade , and more transport , and those all in turn require more energy .
This means that if energy supplies can't expand and energy therefore becomes significantly more expensive , economic growth will falter and the financial system built on expectations of perpetual growth will fail , possibly in a rather spectacular way .
As early as 1998 , Campbell , Laherrère , and others were discussing a Peak Oil impact scenario that went like this .
Sometime around the year 2010 , they theorized , stagnant or falling oil supplies would lead to soaring and more volatile petroleum prices , which would precipitate a global economic crash .
This rapid economic contraction would in turn lead to sharply curtailed energy demand , so oil prices would then fall ; but as soon as the economy regained strength , demand for oil would recover , prices would again soar , and the economy would relapse .
This cycle would continue , with each recovery phase being shorter and weaker , and each crash deeper and harder , until the economy was in ruins .
Meanwhile , volatile oil prices would frustrate investments in energy alternatives : one year , oil would be so expensive that almost any other energy source would look cheap by comparison ; the next year , the price of oil would have fallen so far that energy users would be flocking back to it , with investments in other energy sources looking foolish .
Investment capital would be in short supply in any case because the banks would be insolvent due to the crash , and governments would be broke due to declining tax revenues .
Meanwhile , international competition for dwindling oil supplies might lead to wars between petroleum importing nations , between importers and exporters , and between rival factions within exporting nations .
Naturally , I also examined the arguments against the likelihood of a near - term peak in global oil production .
What if Campbell and Laherrère were simply wrong ?
There are those who claim that new technologies for crude oil extraction will increase the amount of oil that can be obtained from each well drilled , and that there are nearly endless reserves of alternative hydrocarbon resources ( principally tar sands and oil shale ) whose development will seamlessly replace conventional oil , thus delaying the inevitable peak for decades .
There are also those who say that Peak Oil wo n't be much of a problem even if it happens soon , because the market will find substitutes as quickly as needed — whether electric cars , hydrogen , or liquid fuel made from coal .
I found all of these arguments weak : the new oil extraction technologies wo n't come into wide use for several years , and will be applicable mostly to newly developed fields ( of which there are fewer and fewer each year as exploration efforts continue to show mostly disappointing results ) , not to the old super - giant oilfields that produce the great bulk of oil that we use today .
Tar sands and oil shale will be slow to extract ; indeed , in the case of oil shale , we may never derive liquid fuels in any substantial quantity due to the enormous costs of processing this very low - grade material .
And substitutes like electric cars , liquids from coal , and hydrogen will take a very long time to develop and will in most cases be much more costly than the equivalent elements of our current system of petroleum fuels and internal combustion engines .
I continued to study the world energy situation for the next few years .
And , with every passing year , events appeared to be supporting the Peak Oil thesis and undercutting the views of the oil optimists .
Oil prices were trending upward — and for entirely foreseeable reasons : discoveries of new oilfields were continuing to peter out , with most new fields being much more difficult and expensive to develop than ones found in previous years .
More oil - producing countries were seeing their extraction rates peaking and beginning to decline despite efforts to maintain production growth using high - tech , expensive secondary and tertiary extraction methods like the injection of water , nitrogen , or CO2 to force more oil out of the ground .
Production decline rates in the world 's old , super - giant oilfields , which are responsible for the lion 's share of the global petroleum supply , were accelerating .
Production of liquid fuels from tar sands was expanding only slowly , while the development of oil shale remained a hollow promise for the distant future .
I corresponded with and met the authors of the Scientific American article , and interviewed other petroleum geologists and engineers .
One expert after another offered further reasons for concluding that the thesis of " The End of Cheap Oil " was correct , that there were no ready substitutes for crude oil , and that the consequences of a near - term global oil production peak would be profound .
Given the almost complete absence of mainstream media coverage of the subject , I spent several months assessing whether I should step into the breach and write a book on Peak Oil .
The fact that I had no background in the oil industry or in any relevant academic field weighed against doing so .
Yet the need was clearly overwhelming , so I decided to try .
I spent 2001 and 2002 writing The Party 's Over : Oil , War and the Fate of Industrial Societies , which was published the following year and went on to sell over 50,000 copies with translations in six languages .
I began receiving lecture invitations , and , over the next few years , gave over 300 talks to a wide variety of audiences in a dozen countries .
More books followed : PowerDown : Options and Actions for a Post Carbon World ( 2004 ) ; The Oil Depletion Protocol : A Plan to Avert Oil Wars , Terrorism and Economic Collapse ( 2006 ) ; Peak Everything : Waking Up to the Century of Declines ( 2007 ) ; and Blackout : Coal , Climate and the Last Energy Crisis ( 2009 ) .
I was determined to sound a warning not just to the general public , but especially to politicians and appointed government officials .
Members of a burgeoning informal global network of Peak Oil activists arranged for me speak to hundreds of national , state , and local politicians and appointed officials in the U.S. , to about a hundred members of the European Parliament , and to national Parliamentarians in the U.K. , Australia , and New Zealand .
From Scary Theory to Scarier Reality
Then in 2008 , the Peak Oil scenario became all too real .
Global oil production had been stagnant since 2005 and petroleum prices had been soaring upward .
In July , 2008 , the per - barrel price shot up nearly to $ 150 — half again higher ( in inflation - adjusted terms ) than the price spikes of the 1970s that had triggered the worst recession since World War II .
By summer 2008 , the auto industry , the trucking industry , international shipping , agriculture , and the airlines were all reeling .
But what happened next riveted the world 's attention to such a degree that the oil price spike was all but forgotten : in September 2008 , the global financial system nearly collapsed .
The reasons for this sudden , gripping crisis apparently had to do with housing bubbles , lack of proper regulation of the banking industry , and the over -use of bizarre financial products that almost nobody understood .
However , there are reasons for concluding that the oil price spike was a much more important contributor to this economic meltdown than is generally discussed ( see www.energybulletin.net/node/49798).
In the aftermath of that global financial near - death experience , both the Peak Oil impact scenario proposed a decade earlier and the Limits to Growth standard - run scenario of 1972 seemed to be confirmed with uncanny and frightening accuracy .
Global trade was falling .
The world 's largest auto companies were on life support .
The U.S. airline industry had shrunk by almost a third .
Food riots were erupting in poor nations around the world .
Lingering wars in Iraq ( the nation with the world 's second - largest crude oil reserves ) and Afghanistan ( the site of disputed oil and gas pipeline projects ) continued to bleed the coffers of the world 's foremost oil - importing nation .
Meanwhile , the debate about what to do to rein in global climate change exemplified the political inertia that had kept the world on track for calamity since the early ' 70s .
It had by now become obvious to nearly every person of modest education and intellect that the world has two urgent , incontrovertible reasons to rapidly end its reliance on fossil fuels : the twin threats of climate catastrophe and impending constraints to fuel supplies ( with most of the remaining oil reserves located in just a few countries ) .
Yet at the Copenhagen climate conference in December , 2009 , the priorities of the most fuel - dependent nations were clear : carbon emissions should be cut , and fossil fuel dependency reduced , but only if doing so does not threaten economic growth .
The cruel irony , obvious to my Peak Oil - aware colleagues but apparently not to the delegates at Copenhagen , was that the decades - long era of rapid economic growth based on increased fossil - fueled production and consumption is over anyway .
The world 's last chance to collectively , cooperatively negotiate a turn away from the precipice was being squandered for the sake of a goal that was no longer achievable .
I could take no satisfaction from these confirmations of the Limits to Growth and Peak Oil scenarios ; being able to say " I told you so " hardly made up for the shock of knowing that our last opportunities to change direction had been missed and that the train of industrial civilization was now not merely still chugging toward a broken bridge , but was actually starting to plummet into the gorge below .
We had succeeded somewhat in helping increase public awareness of an issue : due to the efforts of thousands of scientists , writers , and activists , " peak oil " had become a recognizable term in public discourse .
But we had failed to budge government policy in more than very minor ways ( I had , for example , assisted the City Council - appointed Peak Oil Task Force of Oakland , California , which produced a sensible report on which , so far , little action has been taken ) .
The world has entered a new era .
The project of awakening and warning policy makers and the general public was worthy of the investment of all the effort we could muster .
In fact , it would have been negligent of the Limits to Growth authors , Colin Campbell , Jean Laherrère , and thousands of climate and environmental scientists and activists ( myself included ) not to give it our best shot .
But it is now too late to avert a collapse of the existing system .
The collapse has begun .
It is time for a different strategy .
By saying this , I am not suggesting that we should all simply give up and accept an inevitable , awful fate .
Even though the collapse of the world 's financial and industrial systems has started , effort now at minimizing further dire consequences is essential .
Collapse does not mean extinction .
A new way of life will almost certainly emerge from the wreckage of the fossil - fueled growth era .
It is up to those of us who have some understanding of what is happening , and why , to help design that new way of life so that it will be sustainable , equitable , and fulfilling for all concerned .
We all need practical strategies and tools to weather the collapse and to build the foundation of whatever is to come after .
Journey to a New Economy
The propositions described above , and my personal journey , are the starting points for a search that can be summarized in a single question :
What are the guideposts toward a livable , inviting post - growth society ?
This search has in many instances entailed a literal , geographic journey .
During the past few years , as I traveled the lecture circuit , I met thousands of people who had already concluded on their own that the global stage was being set for an economic crash of epic proportions .
They had passed through the psychological stages of grief — denial , anger , bargaining , depression , and acceptance .
They were thinking creatively , building new lives , and experimenting with a wide range of strategies for meeting basic human needs while using much less of just about everything .
Some of these folks , like me , had been thinking along these lines for a long time — since the 1970s .
Many were much younger , though , had learned about Peak Oil or climate change just within the past few years , and had recently decided to devote their lives to building a post - hydrocarbon world .
Some were clearly members of what was known in the 1970s as the " counterculture . "
Others were mainstream citizens — investment bankers , real estate sellers , high school teachers , small business owners , corporate middle managers — who had chanced upon information that awakened them forcibly from their routines .
Many of these folks lived in large cities , but others in small towns or on farms ; some were rich , some poor ( a few by choice ) ; some were devout , others agnostic or atheist ; some were working alone on survivalist projects , while others were building community organizations ; some saw the transition as a business opportunity while others were working through non-profit organizations .
Here are just three examples that stand out .
In 2005 , while on a lecture tour in Ireland , I met a young college teacher named Rob Hopkins who believed that life could be better without fossil fuels .
He had led his students in developing an " Energy Descent Action Plan " for their town , and believed he had the seed for something larger and more significant .
He soon moved back to his native England to earn his Ph.D. , and designed his thesis project around helping the village of Totnes begin a cooperative , phased process of transitioning away from its dependence on fossil fuels .
This project in turn led to the start of a series of Transition Initiatives in villages , towns , and neighborhoods throughout the U.K .
In 2007 , a version of Rob 's written Ph.D. thesis was published as a book ( The Transition Handbook ) that quickly began inspiring others to take up this strategy .
Today there are hundreds of Transition Initiatives at various stages of development in a dozen countries ( including over 50 in the U.S. ) .
While in Montana for a speaking engagement at the University of Montana in Helena in spring 2009 , some local Peak Oil activists drove me to the town of Ronan and introduced me to Billie Lee , who had helped start Mission Mountain Food Enterprise Center .
The Center is housed in a fairly small , non-descript building and features medium - scale food processing equipment that local small food producers can rent at reasonable rates .
This enables small farmers to produce value - added products ( everything from canned soups to herbal tea bags ) that are profitable and are price - competitive with those made by industrial food companies located hundreds or thousands of miles from Ronan .
Local food has become an obsession for the sustainability - minded during the past few years , and local food systems will be a necessary pillar of post - growth economies .
Yet aspiring small - scale farmers often have a hard time getting started because they cannot afford the equipment to enable them to produce profitable value - added products .
Here in the tiny hamlet of Ronan was an ingenious solution to the problem , and one that deserves to be replicated in every agricultural county in the nation .
On a trip to New England in 2007 , I met Lynn Benander , a community energy activist and entrepreneur who had started a project called Co-op Power to bring renewable energy to low - income and multi-ethnic communities throughout the Northeast .
Typically , renewable energy projects cost more to get going than conventional coal or gas power projects , and so they tend to be found in wealthier communities and regions .
Conversely , the most polluting energy projects tend to be sited in or near poor neighborhoods or regions .
Co-op
Power aims to change that imbalance of power — in a way that any community can copy .
A typical project :
You help four people put up a solar hot water system and everyone comes to help you put up yours ; you save 40 to 50 percent off your total system price , get to know your neighbors , and learn how your system works .
Co-op Power had also pioneered a cooperative financing method that cuts through the usual roadblocks to renewable energy projects in poorer neighborhoods by leveraging member equity .
Individually , these initiatives and projects may seem to be on too small a scale to make much of a difference .
But multiplied by thousands , with examples in nearly every community , they represent a quiet yet powerful movement .
Few of these efforts have gained national media attention .
Most media commentators who address economic issues are focused on the prospects — positive or negative — of the existing growth - based economy .
These projects do n't seem all that important within that framework of thinking .
But in the new context of the no - growth economy , they may mean the difference between ruinous poverty and happy sufficiency .
The trends are already in evidence : as the financial crisis worsens , more people are planting gardens , and seed companies are working hard to keep up with the demand .
More young people are taking up farming now than in any recent decade .
In 2008 , more bicycles were sold in the U.S. than automobiles ( not good news for the struggling car companies , but great news for the climate ) .
And since the crisis started , Americans have been spending much less on non-essentials — repairing and re-using rather than replacing and adding .
Many economists assume these trends are short - term and that Americans will return to consumerism as economic crisis shifts into recovery .
But if there is no " recovery " in the usual sense , then these trends will only grow .
This is what the early adopters are assuming .
They believe that the nation and the world have turned a corner .
They understand something the media either ignore or deny .
They 're betting on a future of local food systems , not global agribusiness ; of community credit co-ops rather than too - big - to - fail Wall Street megabanks ; of small - scale renewable energy projects , not a world - spanning system of fossil - fuel extraction , trade , and consumption .
A future in which we do for ourselves , share , and cooperate .
They 're embarking on a life after growth .
* * *
The realization that growth is at an end raises many questions .
Will the financial impact be inflationary or deflationary ?
Will some nations fare better than others , leading to protectionist trade wars ?
Will the " down - sizing " of social and economic complexity lead also to a substantial die - off of the human species ?
How quickly will all of this happen ?
There simply are no hard and fast answers to such questions .
The financial , energy , food , transport , and political systems on which we rely are complex , so it is almost impossible to reliably model their response to a shock such as a resource limits - imposed end to economic growth .
The only reasonable response , it seems to me , is to act as if survival is possible , and to build resilience throughout society as quickly as can be , acting locally wherever there are individuals or groups with the understanding and wherewithal .
We must assume that a satisfactory , sustainable way of life is achievable in the absence of fossil fuels and conventional economic growth , and go about building it .
This will be the focus of my work from now on — and it is likely to be the work of the next few generations as well .
Call it Transition , call it cultural survival and renewal , call it what you will , it is the only game in town for the foreseeable future .

ARTIST'S IMPRESSION : Wellington Airport , which is off to the right , will construct a Hollywood - style sign above Miramar Wharf to celebrate the heart of New Zealand 's film industry .
A massive Wellywood sign celebrating Wellington 's success in the film industry will greet tourists as they fly into the capital .
But not everyone agrees on the sign , which will sit on a cutting above Miramar wharf in the seaside eastern suburbs .
Only 44 percent of nearly 9000 respondents to a Stuff online survey were positive about the idea .
Two Facebook pages opposing the sign have been set up , the " A WELLYWOOD sign on the Miramar Cutting hill is a STUPID idea " page has 118 fans , while the " Hey , let 's NOT have a " WELLYWOOD " sign in Wellington " group has 447 members .
The sign , which will mimic the famous Hollywood sign in Los Angeles , will be 28 m long and 3.5 m tall .
This pales in comparison to the size of the Los Angeles sign , the letters of which are 14 m high and 10 m wide .
Wellington Airport will pay for the construction of the sign on the Miramar site which it owns .
The project has already received resource consent and final installation is expected to happen in June .
Wellington Airport chief executive Steve Fitzgerald said the link between the airport and the film industry had grown during the past 17 years .
" The sign will help cement Wellywood 's place as an international tourism landmark . "
He would not say how much the sign will cost .
Sir Peter Jackson said that despite the gloomy economy it was good to see there was still room for some " cheeky fun " .
" It 's Kiwi tongue - in - cheek humour at its very best , but beneath the leg - pulling is genuine pride .
" Several of the most popular films ever made were born in Miramar .
Within a mile of the sign is the birth place of Middle - earth and Pandora . "
Wellington City Council owns 34 per cent of the airport .
Wellington Mayor Kerry Prendergast said the giant sign would capture the essence of the capital .
" The sign will be one of the first things people will see when they arrive in Wellington .
They will be left in no doubt that this is the heart and soul of New Zealand 's film industry . "
Tours of film - related facilities in Miramar are emerging as one of the city 's prime tourist attractions , with about 100,000 people last year visiting the Weta Cave – Weta 's mini-museum , theatrette and shop .
The film industry pumps an estimated $ 285 million a year into Wellington .
Positively Wellington Tourism chief executive David Perks said the city benefited through the international exposure that films generated and the visitors they attracted .
" Stars like Elijah Wood tell the world they love this place .
You ca n't buy that kind of endorsement . "
Hataitai resident Phil Greig , a lab technician on Jackson 's Lord of the Rings trilogy , is not a fan of the Wellywood sign , despite buying himself a personalised number plate – " philmn " – which also has Wellywood written across it .
" Wellywood is a positive thing for Wellington , without a doubt , but there is a bit of conflict there in making a serious industry in Wellington too gimmicky . "
Mainzeal and Beca will construct the sign off - site and installation is scheduled for June .

“ I ’m like a music whore .
I wanna go out and fuck everybody . ”
Slash ’s debut solo album is the must - hear hard rock record of 2010 .
Featuring a glittering supporting cast of friends , legends , contemporaries , pop stars , young upstarts and former Guns N’ Roses bandmates , ‘ Slash ’ the LP is absolutely “ not a lead guitar solo record . ”
Although , as you might imagine , there ’s no shortage of smoking hot guitar playing …
If you want to hear the Slash solo album first , 7 April will see Classic Rock magazine ’s special ' Classic Rock Presents Slash ' fan pack released .
This will feature a 132 - page deluxe edition of the magazine along with a limited edition poster , patch and CD containing all 14 album tracks plus two special bonus cuts .
That ’s right , we said all 14 LP tracks .
In addition to the tracklisting reported previously , another song featuring Alter Bridge frontman Myles Kennedy entitled Back From Cali has been squeezed in at the last minute .
So if you order the Classic Rock Presents Slash fan pack , you now get 16 songs in total .
Back at the tail end of 2009 we caught up with Slash the morning after the Classic Rock awards , and as well as revealing his favourite guitar riffs of all time , he gave us a track - by - track rundown of every song on the album , and revealed all about the collaborative writing and recording process .
The ABS will be launching it's new website next Monday ( 21 September 2020 ) .
This issue of Labour Force , Australia will be the last released to the current website , with next Thursday 's detailed labour force release to be published on the new website .
As a result of the switch - over to the new website , the ABS website ( and ABS Beta website ) is expected to be unavailable between 11 am and 1 pm on Saturday 19 September .
As previously advised , as part of this move to a new ABS website the Labour Force Survey releases are being redesigned ( see the New ABS website and changes to Labour Force Survey publications note for more information on the design and content ) .
On the new ABS website , there will now be two labour force releases ( previously three ) of monthly Labour Force Survey data :
Labour Force , Australia - which will continue to be the headline release ( see of Labour Force , Australia on the ABS Beta website to see what it will look like )
Labour Force , Australia , Detailed - which will contain all spreadsheets and pivot tables currently published in both the monthly and quarterly detailed releases ( see Labour Force , Australia , Detailed on the ABS Beta website to see what it will look like )
At all points during the transition abs.gov.au will remain your official source of statistics .
However , other URL's within the website will be changing so bookmarks will need to be updated .
Catalogue numbers will also no longer appear in release titles on the new website , however you will still be able to search for content using catalogue numbers .
For a short transition period , all releases will include a note indicating the catalogue number the release was previously published under .
See Welcome to the new ABS website for more information about the new ABS website and the changes that have been made .
Professional motorsport is a cold , hard place .
If you want to run with the big dogs , you can't just build a car in your mom 's garage and show up , right ?
Wrong .
One guy did just that .
Here 's his amazing story .
This is the multifaceted tale of Bill Caswell , a man who bought a crapcan off Craigslist to run against $ 400,000 - plus rally cars in a World Rally Championship race .
It is a tale of a guy who had a welder , a bunch of credit cards , and a lot of free time but no real backing or funds .
It is a story of a dude who taught himself how to build an FIA - legal roll cage because he wanted to spend the fabrication fee on race tires instead .
It 's the story of a gearhead who drove a rustbucket to a third - place finish in an FIA - sanctioned event .
Most of all , it is a story of hoonage .
( Welcome all of those who are finding this awesome , two - year - old story .
Bill is still awesome and is now writing a column for us and going on crazy adventures .
Enjoy ! — Editor )

Bill Caswell , an unemployed Chicago racing freak , entered the Mexico round of the World Rally Championship in a 1991 BMW 318i that he found on Craigslist .
The car cost $ 500 .
One year ago , Caswell decided that he wanted to go rallying with Rally America .
Two months later , he crashed a car and blew up an engine five minutes into his first event .
Four events later , he found a loophole in the FIA rules that let him enter a twenty - year - old car in the same event as guys like Ken Block and former F1 driver Kimi Raikkonen .
Full disclosure : Caswell is my friend .
We have a long history of collaborating on stupid , pointless projects .
Most of the time , we hang out in weird bars and at race tracks and talk about the cool things that I want to do but never find time for , the things that Bill actually goes and does .
I am admittedly biased .

The story of Caswell 's WRC entry is a story of weirdness :
He entered the biggest motorsport event of his life with no crew ; an untested , week - old E30 M3 engine swap and a junkyard transmission ( do n't ask ) ; a car that was still covered in dirt from the previous season 's rallies ( " I 'd wash it , but I gotta fix stuff instead " ) ; and a rented panel van .
His co-driver , a Rally America genius named Ben Slocum , had not spent more than five minutes in a car with him prior to the event .
He did this not out of stupidity , but out of a lack of resources — he wanted to go rallying , and this was the only way he could make it happen .
Amazingly , they finished third in their class .
WRC Mexico took place two weeks ago .
I was n't able to attend , but thanks to the wonders of modern technology , I got a non -stop feed from Cas while he was there .
I was originally going to write a story summing it all up , but the emails — Bill 's wild - eyed , how - did - I - get - here updates from the road — proved to need no embellishment .
Here they are .
Enjoy .

( Note : This is a long one .
If you do nothing else , watch the videos and read the bold sections .

Part One : First , We Broke A Lot
The story got dumped into my inbox in fits and starts .
This is the first thing I got after not hearing from him for a week :
I think I am in second .
But I went off and ripped the drivers rear shock right out of the car .
Might be able to weld it but service is like a half hour .

Yeah , that 's reassuring .
Huh ?
It got crazier from there .
I had no phone calls , no updates , just random emails .
They got longer and more rambling as time went on .
The video above — the rally 's ceremonial night start , with thousands of people , a car turntable , and some strange live music in the background — was taken with Bill 's phone .
It showed up in my inbox without warning during the weekend .

Oh , yeah :
The cops shut the highway and city streets down so we could get from city to city fast .
Well let me tell you that hauling ass on rally tires with other rally cars while Mexican cops try to keep up with you is priceless .
Not to mention the streets are just lined with people for over 20 miles .
It was amazing .
Got there too late to do reconnaissance and had to mooch stage notes from the Peruvian rally champion .
Dude is cool but notes are in Spanish or something .
So e's are rights and d's are lefts ?
The FIA put a huge GPS device in the car .
We stop for ten seconds without sending a " We are OK " message and they do n't hear anything by the 30 - second mark , we get a medivac helicopter on our asses and the stage is canceled .
A radiator tube was leaking during tech inspection , and when I was messing with it , one of the officials noticed .
I told him it was overflow and just water ?
I once asked Bill why he insisted on going through every spectator section crossed up and with the engine banging off the limiter .
" Dude , " he said , " I do n't care if it costs me a couple of tenths .
It makes the fans go nuts . "
Fuel pump seized with three stages left .
I took it out , banged on it , borrowed a knife from a police officer and cut up some random cockpit harness to reverse the flow and banged on it until it worked again .
But we were a few minutes late .
We hauled ass and caught up .
Was going to make the last two but got lost and was ejected for day .
Oh well .
Have four hours to sleep , most sleep have had in a week .
Car is perfect .
Fuel pump fixed by the side of the road .
Fixed rear sway bar .
Changed to fresh tires .
Fabricated new hood tie downs with a borrowed welder — had to borrow a larger generator to run it , too — b/c mine cracked off .
Trans brace was held on with only one nut left and loose and halfway undone .
Got lucky .
Also , after fixing fuel pump , we show up at the next stage late .
The officials are like , " The fans think the stage is over , people are now walking down the stage , there are pickups in the middle of the road , you can't run it . "
I had to drive 15 mph , while being timed , through a stage we normally would have gone 100 mph through .
If that was n't enough , [ redacted ] ing Kimi Raikkonen launched his car off the side of the cliff .
A flatbed wrecker was pulling his car out of a ditch and blocking the road .
When the tow truck finally moved , we finished the stage .
Had to make up time and was later told I went by a cop with the car [ redacted ] in [ redacted ] and never lifted .
Someone said the federales set up some sort of road block but we never saw any lights or anything .
( Something tells us that there 's more to this story .
If you run into Bill at a rally or track event , buy him a beer and ask him for details — Ed. )

Part Two : Some Dude Mooned Us ?
I 'm in bad shape but b/c I was last into parc ferme the only room was with the million - dollar WRC cars .
Parked the crapcan with Loeb , Hirvonen , the whole crew .
I can only imagine what the other drivers where thinking when they strapped in : " WTF ?
I was n't even born when that model came out . "
Another FIA guy came up and shook my hand and is coming back for my autograph .
Seriously .
He said he has n't seen a rear wheel drive car in a top event or anything this insane in a while .
And to see one competitive ... I say " sort of . "
Still cool .
Unbelieveable .
We had one stage where I jogged through some houses down a hill at 100 mph slipping sideways for maybe 100 yards .
Awesome .
Time to go [ redacted ] up those Evo things .
There 's a Mitsu in second and third and a five - year - old WRC car in first .
Those were the only cars that finished all stages yesterday .
The roads are beyond punishing .
Like doing 100 mph over dirt washboards .
Oh , I got mooned yesterday .
A dude runs three feet into the road , turns around , drops his pants , and grabs ankles .
WTF .
It 's in the video .
So is Slocum yelling at me for giving a thumbs - up out the window to the photo guys and fans as I drive sideways into the corner with opposite lock .
I thought it looked awesome .
More later .

This is the note that made my heart jump into my throat .
Just rocked the first stage of the day .
Thirty kilometers of craziness .
I came through this 70 - 80 mph section with thousands of people lining the roads .
We come around a corner and there 's a bridge that somehow got missed in the notes .
But it 's a flat piece of concrete like 15 feet wide and our trajectory is right off the side .
Slocum says into the mic , " We 're done , " stops reading notes , and braces for impact .
The river below has boulders the size of Volkswagens .
Sand and gravel in corner , almost as if spectators filled it .
Ca n't get to apex , four feet off , sliding way wide , exit of corner is entrance to bridge .
I pitch the car and floor it .
35 - 45 mph .
Half the car falls off the bridge .
We are looking at daylight and I am full throttle hoping the left tire and diff can put the power down .
We fell so far over the bridge it collapsed the inner leg of the trailing arm by an inch or two .
Almost the entire right side of the car hanging in the air .
Now in the queue for Stage Two , six more to go .
They just closed the stage !
Not sure why but assuming accident .
Block , Sordo , and someone else all stuffed hard on the last stage .
We got beat by both Evos but only by about 45 secs over 23 min .
They have turbos .
We 're over a mile up in elevation .
Trailing arm has a one - inch dent in it from where we hit the bridge .
That 's what saved us — it popped the car back up onto the bridge .
The car smacked the bridge two inches from the bolt that attaches the subframe to the body .

Some of the emails were repeats , but they were charming repeats .
Mooched a welder and welded the shock tower back into the car last night and it held .
But on the first stage the shock mount blew through .
Then the aux fan fried and kept melting fuses and it was hot .
On the third stage we missed a jump call ( our notes were in Portuguese or something ) and hit it at like 80 mph or so and exploded into the air .
The launch felt like hitting a brick wall and broke a motor mount arm clean in half .
But the jump was amazing .
Later I had a minor off but regained the road .
Some kids threw boulders in the road on a transit and I punctured my gas tank losing nearly a half tank in 24 km on the next stage .
Best part , the officials pointed out our leak and showed a handful of gas to us when we asked how big it was —
I knew we were screwed , but they said we could start the stage so we did .
I patched it with just stuff in the trunk — RTV and balls of duct tape — twenty feet after the stage finish , on the side of the road , with the officials watching .
Did n't have time at service to fix it so five stages tomorrow with RTV patch .
Barely finished the rest of the day .
I have a 10 minute service in the morning when we pull the car from parc ferme but we need to put on fresh tires .
I ran into the Rally Mexico organizers in the bar .
Petter Solberg is in there doing shots .
Having entirely too much fun .
Only three real stages tomorrow anyway .
But apparently the ex-WRC car in my class or the Evo broke on the final stage which means I am back into third place .

Part Three : We May or May Not Be Legit
Oh yeah .
Parc ferme — they lock your car up and you can't work on it at night .
But you can pull it out for a 45 - minute service .
So before the final time control , I climbed under the car and undid the motor mount arm with the awesome little factory tool kit in the trunk .
So then I could fab up the new part at my convenience and then pull the car out of parc ferme just to swap arms .
It worked great .
We now have a steel arm and factory mount .
Gas tank still patched with RTV and duct tape .
Was n't time to drain tank and JB Weld it .
Hopefully it stays on today .
By the way .
It 's awesome to be rocking a BMW down here and smoke the little WRC Peugeot cup cars in a chassis that has n't been pro rally racing since the Prodrive E30 M3 era .
The party tonight is supposed to majorly epic .
It 's in another city in some old school Mexican ruins or castle or something according to the guys who went last year .

The video below shows two fans talking to Bill and describing how he passed them on a stage called " El Cubilete . "
Bill 's phone - cam clips are all the same ; they all end with a shot of his face and an amazed , " Can you believe this ?
It 's me ! " look .
OK , I know reading this is probably getting old , but wow .
I 'm having breakfast wearing a BMW jacket and the table next to me ( like ten guys ) turns around and says , " Are you the BMW pilot ? "
I then take pictures with each of them right in the restaurant .
They said they like BMWs but are with a Mexican Dodge club .
They love that I came to the WRC with no team and jump out at each service and start working .
They said that I must be part Mexican because of the way I fix my car .
That 's a compliment , right ?
Wow .
I collapsed the front frame rails vertically from coming down off the jump and smashing the skid plate which is supported by roll cage tubing to plates on the bottom of the frame .
And part of me is sick and wants to see how long I can punish this thing before it cracks in half .
Also , someone wants to give me a free entry and shipping to another rally ?!?
Apparently they watched my co-driver yell at me
Advertisement
to go while I signed autographs and took pictures with the fans until the last possible minute before jumping in the car and taking off .
I guess the other teams blow it off a bit because it gets old having dozens of kids shove stuff in your face while you 're putting on your HANS device .
Slocum and I were estimating .
I signed autographs for three hours straight on Sunday alone .
He thinks it might be close to 1500 or 2000 autographs and maybe 1000 - 1500 pictures .
A couple hundred people were screaming " Caswell ! Caswell ! " at one point .
But I guess the fact that Ken Block and I are the only Americans that came down makes me legit or something ?
We finished third in class .
Do n't know how I got here .
Nuts .

Yeah , Bill — nuts .
You , my friend , are a true Jalop .
You are the hoon of the day , maybe hoon of the month , maybe even hoon of the year .
And you are nothing if not ballsy as hell .
Next time you parachute in and blow the FIA 's world up , give the Jalopnik Nation a shout .
We 'll bring the margaritas and cheer your ass on .
10:39:17 AM
Bill Caswell : Burning Down the House seemed to be the theme song for the whole weird adventure .
We were the only team cranking music during service .
I jump out and first thing I do with my 30 minutes is set up tunes , because you can't work in the hot Mexican sun without music .
You should have seen the crowd .
Driver in firesuit jacking up car and wrenching while Talking Heads blares from the radio and co-driver yells 20 minutes .... it was [ redacted ] real .
I started laughing at one point all by myself while putting a wheel back on — am I really at a WRC event in my favorite chassis and engine combo of all time with no crew fixing the car myself ?
10:41:28 AM
Bill Caswell : Even if I never race again I could be happy .
It was epic .
You should have been there .

UPDATE : There has been some confusion regarding Caswell 's finish and the class that he and Slocum competed in .
Thanks to Cmndrfish for most of the following , which should clear things up :
The class he raced in is called Rally America , but it has no affiliation with the stateside sanctioning body of the same name .
You can find the results ( in PDF form , by stage ) at www.rallymexico.com.
Caswell and Slocum achieved a total time of 5:29:38.4 after penalties , enough for a third - place finish in their class and a hypothetical 23rd if the two men had been competing in WRC .

Twenty - five drivers competed in the WRC class at Rally Mexico .
Caswell and Slocum did n't just compete with $ 400,000 race cars , they beat them .
As always , do n't forget to hit the galleries for more pictures and anecdotes !

Custom viewers can be used to display arbitrary textual information and can be used in any IDA plugin .
They are used in IDA - View , Hex - View , Enum and struct views and the Hex - Rays decompiler .
In this blog entry we are going to write an ASM file viewer in order to demonstrate how to create a custom viewer and populate it with colored lines .
Writing a custom viewer
The simplest custom viewer which does not handle any events ( like key presses , mouse or cursor position movements , displaying hints , etc ) can be created like this :
v = idaapi.simplecustviewer_t( ) if v.Create ( " Simple custom viewer " ) : for i in xrange ( 1 , 11 ) : v.AddLine ( " Line %d " % i ) v. Show ( ) else : print " Failed to create viewer "
If handling events is required then one has to derive from idaapi.simplecustviewer_t class and implement the required callbacks :
class mycv_t( simplecustviewer_t ) : def Create ( self , sn=None ) : # Form the title title =
" Simple custom view test " if sn : title += " %d " % sn # Create the customview if not simplecustviewer_t .
Create ( self , title ) : return False self .
menu_hello = self .
AddPopupMenu ( " Hello " ) self .
menu_world = self .
AddPopupMenu ( " World " ) for i in xrange ( 0 , 100 ) : self .
AddLine ( " Line %d " % i ) return True def OnKeydown ( self , vkey , shift ) : # ESCAPE ? if vkey == 27 : self .
Close ( ) # Goto? elif vkey == ord ( ' G ' ) : n = self .
GetLineNo( ) if n is not None : v = idc.AskLong(self.GetLineNo ( ) , " Where to go ? " ) if v : self .
Jump( v , 0 , 5 ) elif vkey == ord ( ' R ' ) : print " refreshing .... " self .
Refresh ( ) else : return False return True def OnPopupMenu ( self , menu_id ) : if menu_id == self .
menu_hello : print " Hello " elif menu_id == self .
menu_world : print " World " else : # Unhandled return False return True
Or many custom viewers :
view = mycv_t ( ) if view .
Create ( 1 ) : view .
Show ( )
Or many custom viewers :
def make_many ( n ) : L = [ ] for i in xrange ( 1 , n+1 ) : v = mycv_t ( ) if not v.Create ( i ) : break v. Show ( ) L.append( v ) return L # Create 20 views V = make_many ( 20 )
Please note that no two views should have the same title .
To check if a window with a given title exists and then to close it , you can use :
f = idaapi.find_tform
( " Simple custom view test 2 " ) if f : idaapi.close_tform(f , 0 )
For a more comprehensive example on custom viewers , please check the ex_custview .py example .
Using colored lines
To use colored lines , we have to embed color tags to them .
All the available foreground colors are defined in lines .hpp header file .
The color codes are related to various item kinds in IDA , for example here are some colors :
Color name Description SCOLOR_REGCMT
Regular comment SCOLOR_RPTCMT
Repeatable comment SCOLOR_INSN Instruction SCOLOR_KEYWORD Keywords SCOLOR_STRING
String constant in instruction
There are also special color tags treated as escape sequence codes ( the concept is similar to ANSI escape codes ) .
They are used to determine how a line is rendered , to mark the beginning / end of a certain color , to insert address marks , or to mark UTF8 string beginnings / endings :
Color name Description SCOLOR_ON
Escape character ( ON ) SCOLOR_OFF
Escape character ( OFF ) SCOLOR_INV Escape character ( Inverse colors ) SCOLOR_UTF8
Following text is UTF - 8 encoded SCOLOR_STRING
String constant in instruction
In the IDA SDK , a colored line is explained to have the following structure :
// A typical color sequence looks like this : // // COLOR_ON COLOR_xxx text COLOR_OFF COLOR_xxx
Luckily , we do n’t have to form the colored lines manually , instead we can use helper functions :
colored_line = idaapi.COLSTR ( " Hello " , idaapi .
SCOLOR_REG ) + " " + idaapi.COLSTR( " World " , idaapi .
SCOLOR_STRING )
If we look at colored_line contents we can see the following :
' \x01!Hello\x02 ! \x01\x0 bWorld\x02\x0 b '
Which is interpreted as :
COLOR_ON SCOLOR_REG=0x21 Hello COLOR_OFF COLOR=0x21 SPACE COLOR_ON SCOLOR_STRING=0x0B
World COLOR_OFF COLOR=0x0B
In order to strip back color tags from a colored line , use tag_remove ( ) :
line = idaapi.tag_remove(colored_line )
Writing an ASM file viewer
Now that we covered all the needed information , let us write a very basic assembly file viewer .
To accomplish the task , we need two things :
ASM tokenizer :
It should be able to recognize comments , strings and identifiers .
For the identifiers , we will take into consideration only register names , instruction names and directives .
Instruction names :
To get all the instruction names we use idautils .
GetInstructionList ( ) which returns all the instruction names from the processor module ( the ph.instruc array )
which returns all the instruction names from the processor module ( the ph.instruc array ) Register names : Similarly we can use idautils .
GetRegisterList ()
Custom viewer to render the text :
We derive from simplecustviewer_t to handle key presses and popup menu actions
The tokenizer ( asm_colorizer_t class ) will go over the text and when it identifies a token it will call one of the following functions : as_string ( ) , as_comment ( ) , as_num ( ) , and as_id ( ) .
Those functions will use idaapi. COLSTR ( ) to colorize the token appropriately .
At the end of each line , the tokenizer will call the add_line ( ) method to add the line ( after it has been colored ) .
The custom viewer ( implemented by the asmview_t class ) will inherit from both asm_colorizer_t and simplecustviewer_t :
class asmview_t(idaapi.simplecustview_t , asm_colorizer_t ) : def Create ( self , fn ) : # Create the customview if not idaapi.simplecustview_t.Create(self , " ASM View - %s " % os.path.basename( fn ) ) : return False self.instruction_list = idautils.GetInstructionList( ) self.instruction_list.extend ( [ " ret " ] ) self.register_list = idautils.GetRegisterList( ) self.register_list.extend([ " eax " , " ebx " , " ecx " , " edx " , " edi " , " esi " , " ebp " , " esp " ] ) self . fn = fn if not self.reload_file ( ) : return False self.id_refresh = self .
AddPopupMenu ( " Refresh " ) self .
id_close = self .
AddPopupMenu ( " Close " ) return True def reload_file ( self ) : if not self.colorize_file(self.fn ) : self .
Close ( ) return False return
True def colorize_file ( self , fn ) : try : f = open ( fn , " r " ) lines = f.readlines ( ) f.close ( ) self .
ClearLines ( ) self.colorize( lines ) return
True except : return False def add_line ( self , s=None ) : if not s : s = " " self .
AddLine(s ) def as_comment ( self , s ) : return idaapi.
COLSTR(s , idaapi. SCOLOR_RPTCMT ) def as_id( self , s ) : t = s.lower ( ) if t in self .
register_list : return idaapi.COLSTR(s , idaapi. SCOLOR_REG ) elif t in self .
instruction_list : return idaapi.COLSTR(s , idaapi. SCOLOR_INSN ) else : return s def as_string ( self , s ) : return idaapi.
COLSTR(s , idaapi. SCOLOR_STRING ) def as_num ( self , s ) : return idaapi.
COLSTR(s , idaapi. SCOLOR_NUMBER ) def as_directive ( self , s ) : return idaapi .
COLSTR(s , idaapi. SCOLOR_KEYWORD ) def OnPopupMenu( self , menu_id ) : if self.id_refresh == menu_id : return self.reload_file( ) elif self.id_close == menu_id : self .
Close ( ) return
True return False def OnKeydown ( self , vkey , shift ) : # ESCAPE if vkey == 27 : self .
Close ( ) return
True return False

Featured post
In contrast to my 2014 year - in - review piece in which I lamented the disappearance of more than 5,000 articles written and published on my site since October 2006 , I ’m sharing no news this year about suspected cyberattacks and other forms of online skulduggery .
Instead , after writing and publishing more than 300 additional articles during the past 18 months , it ’s time to say goodbye .
Yes , this is the final curtain call on my 10 - year career as an online purveyor of opinions , investigative reports and an occasional dose of humor .
Why the curtain call ?
Because I recently accepted a position with a Fortune 500 company and , due to time constraints , am no longer able to continue this endeavor .
I must say , however , that it ’s been an interesting ride since the days when my website was known as “ BMW : The Ultimate Blogging Machine ” and ranked # 82 among the world ’s Top 100 Conservative Blogs .
As the virtual fabric of this curtain call , I ’d like to challenge other journalists — including those “ citizen ” journalists so often looked down upon by many of my college journalism - school brethren — to pick up the torch and keep the sunlight of disinfectant shining on a handful of topics ( below ) that deserve continued attention :
• THE PENTAGON ’S SEXUAL ASSAULT WITCH HUNT
Since the October 2011 release of my first nonfiction book , Three Days In August : A U.S. Special Forces Soldier ’s Fight For Military Justice , I ’ve been contacted by hundreds of individuals in search of help after they or a loved one found themselves falsely accused of crimes — usually involving members of the opposite sex — and , too often , convicted of those crimes in the military justice system .
The case I ’ve followed most closely since late August involves Army Maj.
Christian “ Kit ” Martin and will be , if I can possibly make it happen , the subject of my next book .
It ’s a big “ IF ” due to the career change , but I hope to make it happen nonetheless .
My 49 - minute Skype interview with Major Martin offers an overview of the people and allegations involved in this case prior to multiple dead bodies being discovered only a week ahead of the date on which the major ’s court - martial was set to begin .
It has now been pushed back to an as - yet - undetermined date in March 2016 .
• INTERROGATION TECHNOLOGY
In April 2008 , I wrote a short piece about the Pentagon ’s plan to deploy portable polygraph technology to war zones , purportedly for use in interrogating terror suspects and others whose information might be valuable to our war effort .
Twelve months later , I asked Pentagon officials a handful of questions about how well the portable polygraphs had worked during their first year of use .
Unsatisfied with the answers I received which seemed to indicate the portable polygraph technology had failed miserably , I launched an investigation that would last more than four years and result in learning about an extremely accurate and effective interrogation technology that Department of Defense leaders had yanked from the “ toolkits ” of our warfighters .
Along the way , I interviewed men who had used that technology with much success .
Among them , Defense Intelligence Agency contractors who interrogated members of Saddam Hussein ’s “ Deck of Cards ” as well as al - Qaeda and Taliban terror suspects and Army Green Berets and Navy SEALs who had used that technology with much success on the battlefield .
In addition , I obtained never - before - published copies of letters and reports written by men who had used that technology with much success to interrogate detainees at Guantanamo Bay during the early days of the Global War On Terror .
In May 2013 , I shared the results of my investigation in the form of my second nonfiction book , The Clapper Memo .
• The Oklahoma City Bombing Trial in Salt Lake City
Though many Americans do n’t even realize it ’s taking place , I ’ve been writing about an Oklahoma City Bombing trial that ’s been slogging its way through a federal court in Salt Lake City as part of a 19 - year ( so far ) search for the truth .
My most recent piece about the trial appeared under the July 1 headline , Pre-Blast Videotapes FBI Claims ‘ Might Have Been Misfiled ’ Remain at Center of Ongoing Oklahoma City Bombing Trial .
Other recent pieces covered topics such as allegations of FBI witness tampering and the judge ’s threat to slap FBI agents with contempt of court charges .
In the interest of time and understanding what ’s at stake , I recommend you watch this chilling one - hour video before you read my other posts about the Oklahoma City Bombing Trial .
• Radiation Contamination in the St. Louis Area
In January 2012 , I wrote my first report about radioactive waste issues in the St. Louis area .
It had to do with a report about cancer concerns related to the Weldon Spring Site in St. Charles County , Mo. , the county just west and northwest of St. Louis County ( Mo. ) .
Three years later , I offered an update under the headline , New Weldon Spring Cancer Report Due Out Early 2016 .
Sadly , state health department officials have refused to provide answers to my latest queries .
As a result , the final word remains to be written on this subject .
There are , of course , many more topics I ’d like to highlight , but I ’ll let you peruse them via the drop - down menu of categories located just below the “ SEARCH ” block in the right sidebar .
Before closing , allow me to suggest you show any appreciation you might have for my decade of work by purchasing copies of my books as Christmas gifts for the readers in your life :
• Chronicling the life story and wrongful prosecution of an elite Army Green Beret , Three Days In August received endorsements from Pamela Gellar of Atlas Shrugs and Richard Miniter , New York Times ’ best selling author and investigative reporter .
For more details about the book , visit http://ThreeDaysInAugust.com.
• To read the list of high - power endorsements of my second nonfiction book , The Clapper Memo , visit http://TheClapperMemo.com.
• For pure entertainment value , I recommend you read about FBI Special Agent Joseph L. Wilson and his effort to solve the mystery behind the deaths of thousands of Americans during the Fourth of July weekend .
The biggest challenge of his law enforcement career , the investigation becomes personal after Wilson realizes he shares one thing in common with those who died : The National Bet .
Thanks for everything and Merry Christmas to you and yours !
It ’s been a great ride !
FYI : Because I might write a few more pieces before the end of the year , I ’ll leave this as a “ Featured Post ” until then .
And , oh yes , I will keep posting occasional thoughts on my Facebook page .
Looks like the United States is beginning to resemble Sweden , Germany and Great Britain when it comes to the muslim rape of kuffar women .
Women are often beaten and raped for the " offense " of wearing western clothes or - as in the case below - " dissing " the physical advances of a muslim man .
" The victim , a 29 - year - old pediatric nurse at New York - Presbyterian Hospital , suffered fractures to her nose , eye socket and skull and required 50 stitches to her face in the vicious assault at the pub early Thursday morning .
( Moroccan National ) Mbarek Lafrem admitted he had tried to cut in while the woman was dancing with another man but she rebuffed him .
He said he was drunk and angry , and when she went to the bathroom , he followed her in and brutally beat her , the sources said .
She was found lying unconscious with her pants down . "
( See article below )
Muslim men clearly can't control their genitals or their hatred of women who do not show Quranic submission as Islam is at the core of why muslim men rape and disrespect the " infidel " women .
A few ( far from complete ) statements of what the Religion of Peace teaches muslim men about the worth of women and the raping of the kuffar :
--" Islam gives an open license to Muslim men to have sexual intercourse with women as long as these women are not Muslims and / or when these Muslim men are living in an infidel country . "
Link
-- Islamic courts judge raped women - not as victims - but as adulterers .
-- Islam and paedophilia
-- Women / girls not wearing headscarves or dressing in Western clothing are " asking for rape "
-- In Islam there is no such thing as rape
-- and How Sharia
Law punishes raped women
-- The status of women in Islam
For more on this go to HERE or HERE or HERE
One wonders if the United States media will also remain silent - as they do in Europe & Australia - in regards to the exploding numbers of rapes of ' infidel ' women by muslim men .
In what could be seen as the greatest betrayal of women - women 's rights groups are not speaking out preferring to hide behind passive ' multicultural benevolence ' rather than being outspoken against muslim male violence against women - worldwide .
Meanwhile women are paying a high price for Western countries dhimmified embracing and acceptance of multiculturalism .
Article in full :
Chief police spokesman Paul Browne says 30 - year - old Mbarek Lafrem , of Norwood , Pa. , was charged with assault and attempted rape .
A phone number listed for him in Norwood was disconnected .
Browne says Lafrem was working at a midtown construction site and was staying at a hotel near the bar .
He says Lafrem 's co-workers contacted authorities after they saw him in a video released by police .
The victim , a 29 - year - old pediatric nurse at New York - Presbyterian Hospital , suffered fractures to her nose , eye socket and skull and required 50 stitches to her face in the vicious assault at the pub early Thursday morning .
Lafrem admitted he had tried to cut in while the woman was dancing with another man but she rebuffed him .
He said he was drunk and angry , and when she went to the bathroom , he followed her in and brutally beat her , the sources said .
She was found lying unconscious with her pants down .
Although a rape kit came back negative , police are treating it as an attempted sexual assault .
Police had put out video footage of Lafrem walking out of the bar at 2:17 a.m. and shaking his hand as if he had injured it .
He was also captured on video at a nearby store minutes later .
The victim , who underwent surgery at Weill Cornell Medical Center was recovering with her family yesterday .
" [ The family ] wishes to express their sincere gratitude for the outpouring of support they have received , " the hospital said in a statement .
The monster accused of viciously beating a nurse in the bathroom of a Hell ’s Kitchen bar after she rebuffed him on the dance floor was slapped with beefed up charges of attempted murder at his arraignment in Manhattan criminal court this morning .
Mbarek Lafrem , 30 — a construction worker from Norwood , Pa— appeared expressionless in a rumpled Yankees jacket and did not utter a word at the hearing .
" This case is a vicious and brutal attack , " said prosecutor Dan Brody .
The Moroccan national told police that he callously attacked her after she tried to push him inside of the women ’s restroom .
" I was at the bar with the girl .
I went into the bathroom and she started yelling at me , " Lafrem said , according to court papers .
" She was coming toward me , so I grabbed her by the arm .
She was trying to push me , so I punched her in the face twice and pushed her back into the stall .
She fell into the stall and her head . "
He was also charged with assault and attempted rape .
The victim was found in the bathroom with one pant leg completely off and the other around her ankle , the court papers said .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- MIT neuroscientists have shown they can influence people 's moral judgments by disrupting a specific brain region — a finding that helps reveal how the brain constructs morality .
To make moral judgments about other people , we often need to infer their intentions — an ability known as “ theory of mind . ”
For example , if one hunter shoots another while on a hunting trip , we need to know what the shooter was thinking :
Was he secretly jealous , or did he mistake his fellow hunter for an animal ?
MIT neuroscientists have now shown they can influence those judgments by interfering with activity in a specific brain region — a finding that helps reveal how the brain constructs morality .
Previous studies have shown that a brain region known as the right temporo - parietal junction ( TPJ ) is highly active when we think about other people ’s intentions , thoughts and beliefs .
In the new study , the researchers disrupted activity in the right TPJ by inducing a current in the brain using a magnetic field applied to the scalp .
They found that the subjects ’ ability to make moral judgments that require an understanding of other people ’s intentions — for example , a failed murder attempt — was impaired .
The researchers , led by Rebecca Saxe , MIT assistant professor of brain and cognitive sciences , report their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of March 29 .
Funding for the research came from The National Center for Research Resources , the MIND Institute , the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging , the Simons Foundation and the David and Lucille Packard Foundation .
The study offers “ striking evidence ” that the right TPJ , located at the brain ’s surface above and behind the right ear , is critical for making moral judgments , says Liane Young , lead author of the paper .
It ’s also startling , since under normal circumstances people are very confident and consistent in these kinds of moral judgments , says Young , a postdoctoral associate in MIT ’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences .
“ You think of morality as being a really high - level behavior , ” she says .
“ To be able to apply ( a magnetic field ) to a specific brain region and change people ’s moral judgments is really astonishing . ”
Thinking of others
Saxe first identified the right TPJ ’s role in theory of mind a decade ago — a discovery that was the subject of her MIT PhD thesis in 2003 .
Since then , she has used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to show that the right TPJ is active when people are asked to make judgments that require thinking about other people ’s intentions .
In the new study , the researchers wanted to go beyond fMRI experiments to observe what would happen if they could actually disrupt activity in the right TPJ .
Their success marks a major step forward for the field of moral neuroscience , says Walter Sinnott - Armstrong , professor of philosophy at Duke University .
“ Recent fMRI studies of moral judgment find fascinating correlations , but Young et al usher in a new era by moving beyond correlation to causation , ” says Sinnott - Armstrong , who was not involved in this research .
The researchers used a noninvasive technique known as transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) to selectively interfere with brain activity in the right TPJ .
A magnetic field applied to a small area of the skull creates weak electric currents that impede nearby brain cells ’ ability to fire normally , but the effect is only temporary .
In one experiment , volunteers were exposed to TMS for 25 minutes before taking a test in which they read a series of scenarios and made moral judgments of characters ’ actions on a scale of one ( absolutely forbidden ) to seven ( absolutely permissible ) .
In a second experiment , TMS was applied in 500 - milisecond bursts at the moment when the subject was asked to make a moral judgment .
For example , subjects were asked to judge how permissible it is for a man to let his girlfriend walk across a bridge he knows to be unsafe , even if she ends up making it across safely .
In such cases , a judgment based solely on the outcome would hold the perpetrator morally blameless , even though it appears he intended to do harm .
In both experiments , the researchers found that when the right TPJ was disrupted , subjects were more likely to judge failed attempts to harm as morally permissible .
Therefore , the researchers believe that TMS interfered with subjects ’ ability to interpret others ’ intentions , forcing them to rely more on outcome information to make their judgments .
“ It does n’t completely reverse people ’s moral judgments , it just biases them , ” says Saxe .
When subjects received TMS to a brain region near the right TPJ , their judgments were nearly identical to those of people who received no TMS at all .
While understanding other people ’s intentions is critical to judging them , it is just one piece of the puzzle .
We also take into account the person ’s desires , previous record and any external constraints , guided by our own concepts of loyalty , fairness and integrity , says Saxe .
“ Our moral judgments are not the result of a single process , even though they feel like one uniform thing , ” she says .
“ It ’s actually a hodgepodge of competing and conflicting judgments , all of which get jumbled into what we call moral judgment . ”
Saxe ’s lab is now studying the role of theory of mind in judging situations where the attempted harm was not a physical threat .
The researchers are also doing a study on the role of the right TPJ in judgments of people who are morally lucky or unlucky .
For example , a drunk driver who hits and kills a pedestrian is unlucky , compared to an equally drunk driver who makes it home safely , but the unlucky homicidal driver tends to be judged more morally blameworthy .

About forty years ago in Poland , an adventurous strain of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus made a seemingly unprecedented move , a new study shows : it crossed over from humans to chickens and settled in to stay .
The disease has since spread worldwide to become the leading cause of lameness in broiler chickens .
J. Ross Fitzgerald and graduate student Bethan V. Lowder of the University of Edinburgh , along with eight colleagues , discovered the big jump and reconstructed the pathogen ’s diversification and pandemic spread .
To do so , they compared DNA sequences from fifty - seven S. aureus samples isolated during the past half century from poultry living on four continents .
Remarkably , the team found , most poultry - infecting strains belong to a single genetic group and are closely related to a few human strains that circulated exclusively in Poland in the 1990s .
That suggests a single , recent , human - to - poultry host switch .
The poultry strains subsequently lost genes involved in human pathogenesis and acquired ones that confer virtual imperviousness to attack by chicken immune cells , the team found .
Thus , the avian strains seem to have adapted to their new host .
That ’s a first from the short list of pathogens that animals can pick up from humans ( usually we hear about animal pathogens adapting to humans ) .
In the human - to - poultry case , the conditions seem uniquely optimal for spreading infection : a few multinational companies distributing huge numbers of live chickens worldwide .
But microbes are resourceful ; most likely , epidemiologists have n’t looked hard enough for other cases .
This research was published in the journal PNAS .
The news media paints an overly optimistic picture of cancer .
That 's according to one of a series of papers being published in the March 17 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association and in six of JAMA 's sister journals this month , as well as at presentations at a two - hour media briefing today at the National Press Club in Washington , D.C .
The reality in less scientific terms : Cancer really sucks .
For every Lance Armstrong who beats cancer , there 's someone who loses the battle , according to researchers at the University of Pennsylvania , whose study on the news media to appear in the March 22 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine was released today to coincide with the generally glum news from the JAMA press event .
If you 're a man , you have about a 50 percent chance of getting cancer .
If you 're a woman , you have about a one - in - three chance ; but do n't get too complacent because the odds are getting worse .
If you do get cancer , you have nearly a 50 percent chance on average of dying from it or from a related illness , the researchers said .
And truth be told , Lance 's testicular cancer was an easy one to beat .
Invincible foe
Fortunately , treatments in recent years have improved so that ...
No , wait , too optimistic .
Cancer remains a leading cause of death in the United States , killing over a half million Americans annually .
Much of the cancer reduction has been a result of anti-smoking campaigns and better nutrition and screening .
Several types of cancer — particularly pancreatic , liver , ovary , lung and brain cancer — are highly lethal and remain largely non-responsive to current therapies .
Fortunately , advanced diagnostic tools have ...
No , wait , too optimistic again .
Back to the JAMA papers .
The war on cancer is essentially futile because there are more than 100 different types of cancer , each with a different cause and each controlled by a different biological mechanism .
" The inherent genetic instability of cancers allows them to change rapidly and generate clones that are resistant to treatment ; indeed , many cancers are masters of disguise , camouflaged from host defenses , " according to Susan Gapstur and Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society , who provided commentary in the March 17 JAMA article .
Sucker for good news
But it 's hard not to remain somewhat positive about the topic of cancer treatment .
Indeed , many of the JAMA and related articles and presentations are tinged with optimism .
Consider these findings reported today :
Radiation therapy that involves numerous highly - focused and potent radiation beams provides targeted tumor control in nearly all patients , reduces treatment - related illness , and may ultimately improve survival for patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer .
Older patients with colon cancer can do well with chemotherapy that is less toxic and of shorter duration than therapy younger patients receive .
New chemotherapy agents appear associated with improvements in survival time for patients with metastastic colorectal cancer .
The other side of the story
The point of the University of Pennsylvania study was not to chastise the news media but rather assess what elements of cancer treatment are being routinely reported .
The researchers examined over 400 articles from some of the most widely read U.S. magazines and newspapers , such as Time , Parade , and the New York Times .
They found that journalists frequently cover aggressive treatment and survival but rarely discuss treatment failure , adverse events , end - of - life care or death .
Considering the reality of death for cancer patients , the lopsided reporting may give patients an " inappropriately optimistic view " of prognosis , the researchers said .
And this comes at the expense of not relaying important issues , such as palliative and hospice care .
The take - home message from the JAMA cancer news event is that a cancer diagnosis will be a life - altering event .
Optimism is n't a bad thing ; it might be associated with survival .
But understanding the reality and familiarizing yourself with all care options , particularly as death approaches , might be the best medicine for you and surviving family members .

If you think consuming products with high fructose corn syrup is a good way to avoid sugar , think again .
You are better off with sugar !
Of course , you probably know by now that any aspartame type sweetener is out of the question .
But high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) is also a very poor choice .
HFCS is a sweet deal for food processors and soft drink companies because it`s cheaper than sugar and even sweeter .
It`s also easier to convince an unsuspecting consumer public that it`s healthier , even if it usually comes from GMO corn .
But health hazards from GMO corn aren`t the only issues .
Fructose in fruits and vegetables comes as part of a digestible whole food package that contains much less fructose than soft drinks and other processed foods .
The digestive system is not familiar with high amounts of Dr. Andrew Weil states , " The body doesn`t handle large amounts of fructose well .
You can maintain life with intravenous glucose , but not with intravenous fructose ; severe derangement of liver function results .
There is also evidence that a high intake of fructose elevates levels of circulating fats ( serum triglycerides ) , increasing the risk of heart disease ...
" Our cells use glucose for energy by metabolizing carbohydrates .
With glucose from cane or beet sugar , 20 % is passed onto the liver to be metabolized .
But the gut doesn`t know what to do with isolated high fructose .
So it passes 100 % of the isolated fructose into the liver .
Consequently , the liver metabolizes the high fructose content into mostly fats and triglycerides .
High amounts of HFCS are apt to create non alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , and possibly cirrhosis .
Insulin resistance is another manifestation of HFCS metabolic damage .
HFCS creates even more metabolic damage because it has no effect on , whichstimulates appetite , and interferes with the brain`scommunication , which lets you know you`ve had enough to eat ..
Glucose suppresses ghrelin and doesn`t interfere with leptin .
So hunger cravings are satisfied easily with glucose from even regular sugar .
Metabolic disorders from HFCS have been shown to induce diabetes type II and obesity , two outbreaks of bad health that have increased dramatically Ironically , these two epidemics and rising heart disease have occurred despitecampaigns of increased exercise with decreased fat intakes over the last three decades .
Processing HFCS leads to substantial levels of mercury .
As if HFCS is not enough , the food and beverage industry has recently one upped HFCS with .
It`s further refined and more potent than HFCS , which is 45 % sucrose and 55 % fructose .
Crystalline fructose is 100 % pure fructose , making it evenCrystalline fructose is now being used in some sports drinks , flavored waters , and even so called health beverages .
Simply avoid beverages and foods with high fructose corn syrup or crystalline fructose .
Make your own fruit juices .
Drink pure water with a pinch of organic unprocessed salt to rehydrate after exercise .
For the sweet tooth , use stevia or raw organic honey and raw organic sugar in moderation instead .

This documentary covers a whole lot of ground .
It deals with every historical and contemporary aspect of hemp usage and cultivation ( mainly in the U.S. ) , which turns out to be a lot .
From describing the production of a fibre much more durable and economic than wood , the documentary discusses hemps multilateral uses as e.g. food products , as a non-polluting fuel and as a pharmaceutical product with much less griveous sideeffects than chemical pharmaceutical products .
The film also investigates why America went from a country which produced vast quantities of the non-narcotic industrial hemp , to the complete ban on hemp production in 1938 .
This story in particular is interesting , and it points out that the large oilbased industries actually had a key role in the aforementioned ban .
Food for thought !
The conclusion of the documentary could be that hemp may prove to be a valid alternative to both oil and wood in the future .
Today is the first day of the PostgreSQL Conference in Philadelphia , PA .
I ’m here specifically to attend training on Sunday , but since we had to pay the conference fee to take the training , it would be silly not to sit in on the sessions .
I ’ve been learning a lot , probably because I have very limited experience with PostgreSQL before now .
I ’ve been playing with it for a couple of weeks in my spare time , and I ’m really liking the feature set .
If you ’re solely a MySQL person , let me encourage to give you a shot .
The installation is n’t difficult at all ( in fact , most distros include it via the local package manager , which is great for playing around with ) .
Before now , I ’d only really played with MySQL .
I ’m already envisioning things to do with PostgreSQL , and I keep thinking back to all of the times I was writing PHP code and wished the database could natively store arrays .
Well , PostgreSQL can .
Also , geometric shapes , and IP addresses , MAC addresses , etc etc .
Really , you should just go check out the list of data types .
It ’s …* ahem * extensive .
Anyway , as I said , I ’m having a good time .
I met Jason Dixon , finally , after we ’ve talked on twitter for ages .
He was demoing Circonus , which is a SaaS monitoring / trending service .
From what I saw , the interface looks nice .
I ’m guessing it ’ll have a lot of business from people who do n’t want to deal with monitoring on their own .
In any event , their interface is slick .
So I ’ve got a few more days here , and I ’m going to try to make the most of them .
If you ’re here , let me know and we ’ll meet up for dinner or drinks some night .
If not , then I ’m sure I ’ll catch you at PICC in May . right ?
Right !

Today programme
Summer 1937 .
What could be more fitting in the cool afternoon of an English country lane than a group of cycling tourists steadily pedalling their way from one historic site to another , stopping to camp overnight in fields along the way .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The only problem was , that summer , some of those groups of teenage boys were Hitler Youth .
In an era without satellite photography , when detailed ordnance survey maps could be hard to come by and when tension in Europe was rising , MI5 were worried that this innocent cyclo - tourism was a cover for spying .
MI5 had been told that Hitler Youth groups visiting abroad were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire , including questions on terrain , population , and political views of the population .
Hitler regarded his youth movement as the kernel of an Aryan ' master race '
They were asked to take photographs , especially of industry , and to get lists of names of all those taking part in anti-German movements .
In May 1937 , the British " Daily Herald " paper had printed an article about " spyclists " - based on translation of the Nazi Cycling Association 's advice to members travelling abroad .
It too asked travellers to try to note carefully the features of the countryside they visited : " Get into your head all landmarks like steeples and towers and all fords and bridges and acquaint yourself with them in such a way that you will be able to recognise them by night "
And one of the senior figures in the Hitler Youth had moved to London at the start of the year , ostensibly to study .
MI5 suspected that Joachim Benemann 's real object however was to develop the Hitler Youth in the UK .
Local papers speculated on the real reason for the visits
On an earlier visit , undertaken in 1934 and 5 , he had set up joint Anglo - German youth camps , one at Bryanston School , and he had tried to develop links between the Hitler Youth and the Boy Scouts , without much success .
So the head of MI5 , Colonel Sir Vernon Kell , decided to try to track visiting Hitler Youth cycling groups .
Chief Constables were asked to monitor them , to try to find out what their planned routes were , without questioning the leaders .
From the file , it appears they identified seven substantial groups , each of about twenty young men .
These were generally the older members of the Hitler Youth : in their late teens or early twenties .
Their itineraries were usually built round visits to the great English historic sites - Oxford , Cambridge , London .
Though one party was touring Scotland and another finished in Wales .
MI5 did not shadow the cyclists closely , so it is not recorded exactly where they stayed and who they met .
There was some reporting in local papers though : the Boston and Spalding Free Press reported that the Spalding Rotary Club laid on a special dinner for one group , who thoroughly enjoyed their sausages and mash , and charmed the local people with their good manners .
' Hitler salute '
The Hitler Youth who travelled to Britain had been specially selected - a number had even had been to training camps before the visit .
Some of them met or shared camps with British Boy Scout groups .
The most striking was the Tamworth Scout troop - for whom this was a return visit .
They had already been guests of the Hitler Youth in Hamburg earlier in the summer , thanks to their very pro-German Scoutmaster .
It was like a Roman legion
Les Fardon , former Boy Scout
They had stayed at a Hitler Youth camp and even taken part in a torchlight rally .
One of the boys , Les Fardon , told Radio 4's Document Programme ten years ago : " It was like a Roman legion , " he said .
" You had these long banners and you were marching to tune ... it was very stirring and frightening "
Another of his fellow Scouts remembered it as being a very exciting trip , and he recalled how even the British boys fell into doing the " Heil Hitler " salute .
" They liked you to do it , " he added .
Both boys made friends with some of the Germans .
When the Hitler Youth came to visit them , it proved controversial , and prompted intense debate in the pages of the local paper , the Birmingham Post .
The head of MI5 asked to see the letters .
The most pro-German was R. Charles Lines who wrote about the farewell supper for the Hitler Youth : " Many remarks passed to me by Tamworth residents showed very plainly what a wonderful impression these boys have made during their stay .
There is no doubt that Tamworth has thoroughly enjoyed entertaining them and I know how splendidly local people have risen to the occasion "
Which prompted a tart response from another correspondent , " WFA " , who wrote : " Is it not easily understandable that when one has first hand information of the persecution and cruelty meted out by youthful Nazis at home , one is suspicious of their perfect behaviour abroad .
One is bound to ask oneself " is it a confidence trick ? "
The charm offensive was being carried out at a far higher level too .
In November 1937 Lord Baden Powell met the Chief of Staff of the Hitler Youth at the German Embassy .
The elderly Chief Scout had long been an admirer of the Hitler Youth , and was keen to develop closer links .
Baden Powell was asked if he would visit Hitler personally , and did not demur , telling the Germans that he was " fully in favour of anything which would bring about a better understanding between our nations "
The British government stepped in to stop that though .
A note on the file shows that Lord Cranbourne , Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , called Lord Baden Powell 's chosen successor , Lord Somers , around a fortnight later .
He " strongly deprecated " close relations , runs the note .

Having forcibly evicted Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem , the new inhabitants sing songs in praise of the mass murderer Baruch Goldstein .
And you really think the decision to make the site of that massacre a national heritage site for Israel had nothing to do with this association ?
Maybe AIPAC will wake up one of these days and see the reality that less informed and educated observers cannot miss :

Most of these viruses have already gone extinct due to human evolution and changes in environments .
Modern medicine also played a role in the extinction of these viruses .
If scientists were to revive any of these viruses , it could cause a major outbreak that humans wo n’t quickly heal from .
A large DNA - based virus once took residence inside a bacterial cell .
A scientific theory states that this phenomenon created the first cell nucleus over billions of years ago .
If this is true , it would imply that humanity descended from a foundation of viruses .
However , despite the theory stating a DNA - based virus created the first cell nucleus , viruses themselves have no such thing .
Some prehistoric viruses are believed to have played a role in our autoimmune diseases .
The viral relics found in our genomes are believed to be the reason why we are immune to certain diseases .
This includes certain cancer viruses as well .
It is harder for naked viruses to break open host cells .
Naked viruses refer to viruses that do not have a protein coating .
This coating is referred to as a capsid .
This envelope is a determining factor in how a virus can enter and exit a host after it matures .
There are 2 main virus types .
A virus may contain either a single or double - stranded DNA basis for its genetic material .
Some viruses also contain single or double - stranded RNA .
Additionally , their genetic formation is organized to form a straight strand .
Others may also have circular molecules .
Viruses can remain dormant in a host body for years .
Viruses undergo multiple life cycles .
The virus enters the host by fusion with other cells .
This causes the host ’s cells to replicate the virus DNA and grow .
This cycle repeats until it takes over the entire host ’s system .

Retroviruses are commonly used in gene therapy .
Retroviruses contain RNA .
This virus replicates its genome by using an enzyme known as reverse transcriptase .
The enzyme then converts the virus into something that can be integrated into the host DNA .
These viruses are important because they can insert genes into human chromosomes .

What determines whether an image is remembered or forgotten ?
New evidence suggests that attending to a task in the foreground could enhance memory for scenes in the background at behaviorally relevant points in time .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000338.g001
Human memory for visual scenes varies according to a number of factors .
These include the novelty of the scene , its behavioral relevance , and the subject 's attention .
Often , people will clearly remember details of the context in which they received shocking news — for example , remembering where they were and what they were doing when they heard that Elvis had died .
This raises the possibility that another factor that can influence memory , even for irrelevant details , is the co-occurrence of a highly relevant stimulus .
In a new study in this issue of PLoS Biology , Lin et al. tested this theory using a technique called “ rapid serial visual presentation ” or RSVP .
This protocol involves showing subjects a series of visual scenes , each scene being visible for only a short time , and then testing recognition memory by asking subjects whether a particular scene was present in the series .
The researchers began by presenting subjects with a series of 16 familiar scenes , and then testing whether they could identify which scenes had been presented .
Surprisingly , performance on this task was no better than chance .
However , when the series of scenes was presented at the same time as a letter recognition task to which the subjects had to pay attention , the subjects were significantly better at recognising scenes that had been presented simultaneously with the target letter ( which was white among black distractor letters ) than at recognising scenes that were presented with the distractors .
This supports the idea that a visual scene can be automatically committed to memory at Behaviorally relevant time points , such as when a target is presented during a task .
But does this apply only to visual targets , or can other types of highly relevant stimulus also enhance visual scene memory ?
The authors addressed this question by presenting visual scenes while subjects attended to an auditory tone recognition task .
As in the letter recognition task , subjects ' memories were enhanced for the scene that was presented when the target tone was played .
To test whether the memory enhancement effect depended on the behavioral relevance of the target stimulus or on its physical novelty compared with the non-target stimuli , the authors repeated the letter recognition experiment , but instructed the subjects to ignore the letter stimuli and instead concentrate on the scene recognition task .
Under these conditions , there was no memory enhancement ; subjects were no more likely to correctly recognise the scene that had been presented with the white target letter than those that had been presented with the black distractor letters .
This suggests that behavioral relevance , rather than perceptual novelty , is responsible for the enhanced scene memory in the preceding experiments .
These studies point towards a new mechanism by which attention can influence memory , in which memory for background scene can be enhanced even though attention is focused tightly on a target item in the foreground — or even on a target sound .
Further studies are likely to investigate the parameters of this effect and to address the potential mechanisms of memory enhancement .

Originally , when I began reporting on the Neo - Nazis and conspiracy theory driven right wing extremists and their associations with Ron Paul , I assumed they were a fringe group who jumped on to the Ron Paul bandwagon .
Then after doing extensive research , I realized that not only did the Neo - Nazis and the John Birch / Timothy McVeigh based conspiracy theorists support Ron Paul , but Ron Paul supports the views of the Neo - Nazis and the conspiracy theorists .
There are several pieces of evidence tying Paul to both white supremacists and right wing conspiracy theorists .
One connection that ties Paul to both Neo - Nazis and conspiracy theorists , is his close connection to the John Birch society .
The John Birch Society is a group that has been called , paranoid , radical , racist , and extremist , and believes in a Jewish / Freemason conspiracy to transform the world into a communist “ New World Order . ”
The John Birch Society
The John Birch society holds McCarthy as a hero and believes that “ liberal ” politicians and are part of a “ communist ” conspiracy known as “ Insiders ” .
They opposed the Civil Rights movement and Civil Rights legislation ( and still do ) , called Martin Luther King a radical socialist threat ( and still do ) , praised apartheid and believe that Nelson Mandela was “ a communist terrorist thug ” and campaigned for segregationist Presidential candidate George Wallace .
What is most scary about the John Birch Society , is that it seems to be a breeding ground for Neo - Nazis .
Several members of the intellectual wing of the White Nationalist Neo -Nazi movement come directly from the John Birch society .
One of the founders of the John Birch Society was Revilo P. Oliver , who went on to found the white nationalist Neo - Nazi organization , The National Alliance which named Hitler “ the greatest man of our era . ”
Another member of the John Birch society was William Pierce , also a founder of the National Alliance , who also wrote “ The Turner Diaries . ” “ The Turner Diaries ” is credited with inspiring Timothy McVeigh to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City , Killing 168 people .
Other prominent members of the John Birch society , who played large roles in the Neo - Nazi movement , include Tom Metzger , who was a Grand Dragon of the KKK and Kevin Strom , the former managing director of National Vanguard , ( another prominent white supremacist organization ) who was convicted for child pornography .
The Southern Poverty Leadership Committee claims the John Birch society is responsible for a lot of the Patriot movement “ New World Order , ” anti-government ideologies that spread to militias and Neo - Nazis .
Ron Paul was the keynote speaker for the John Birch Society ’s 50th Anniversary and spoke about the strong connection he had to the society and their ideologies .
The John Birch Society is a great patriotic organization featuring an educational program solidly based on constitutional principles .
I congratulate the Society in this , its 50th year .
I wish them continued success and endorse their untiring efforts to foster ‘ less government , more responsibility … and with God ’s help … a better world . ' ”
I am delighted to help celebrate this birthday . ”
“ I ’m sure there are people in this room who probably helped me in that campaign , because I know that so many of you have over the years . ” continue what you have been doing ….. I come with a positive message and congratulations to you for all you have done .
Congratulations and thank you very much for having me tonight .
The John Birch society had a big role in Paul ’s “ Rally For The Republic ” in where their leader spoke and they distributed anti “ New World Order ” materials .
Johny Lee Clary , a former Imperial Wizard for the KKK , said this about the John Birch Society .
The John Birch Society is just a political version of the KKK , without the name of the KKK .
They center on the political ideas of the Klan and are not as vocal in public on the ideas of the racial superiority , but they attract the same people and say the same things behind closed doors .
A rose by any other name is still a rose … the Klan by any other name is still Klan .
Aside from his involvement in the John Birch society , Ron Paul has an extensive history of writing and promoting racist literature that would seem to come from one of the many John Birch Neo -Nazi offshoots .
Ron Paul’s , Ron Paul newsletter contained articles attacking African - Americans , for being unintelligent , lazy and prone to crime , and Jews for being part of Zionist conspiracies .
The newsletters also contained pro-militia articles that advised militia armed groups to “ Leave no clues … Avoid the phone as much as possible , ” …. Do n’t fire unless fired upon , but if they mean to have a war , let it begin here ” three months before McVeigh bombed the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma .
Here are some of the many racist quotes that can be found in Paul ’s newsletter from 1978 till 1995
On the L.A. Riots “ Order was only restored in L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks three days after rioting began , ” ‘ civil rights , ’ quotas , mandated hiring preferences , set - asides for government contracts , gerrymandered voting districts , black bureaucracies , black mayors , black curricula in schools , black tv shows , black tv anchors , hate crime laws , and public humiliation for anyone who dares question the black agenda On African - American Political Opinion Opinion polls consistently show that only about 5 percent of blacks have sensible political opinions , i.e. support the free market , individual liberty and the end of welfare and affirmative action On African - Americans and Crime Given the inefficiencies of what D.C. laughingly calls the `criminal justice system , ’ I think we can safely assume that 95 percent of the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal , America ’s number one need is an unlimited white checking account for underclass blacks .
mostly black welfare recipients will feel justified in stealing from mostly white ‘ haves . ’
Paul also used the newsletter to refer to call the end of apartheid in South Africa , the “ destruction of civilization ” and warned of a South African Holocaust after Nelson Mandela was elected .
Paul ’s newsletter also included several attacks on Martin Luther King .
After Martin Luther King Day was named a national holiday , this was written in his newsletter , “ What an infamy Ronald Reagan approved it !….. We can thank him for our annual Hate Whitey Day ”
While the newsletter criticized Martin Luther King , it praised former KKK Grand Wizard , David Duke , “ Is David Duke ’s new prominence , despite his losing the gubernatorial election , good for anti-big government forces ?
our priority should be to take the anti-government , anti-tax , anti-crime , anti-welfare loafers , anti-race privilege , anti-foreign meddling message of Duke , and enclose it in a more consistent package of freedom . ”
In This Quote , Paul Exhibits The Paranoid Conspiracy Driven Anti-Semitic , Homophobic , Racist View From The John Birch Society
I ’ve been told not to talk , but these stooges do n’t scare me .
Threats or no threats , I ’ve laid bare the coming race war in our big cities .
The federal - homosexual cover - up on AIDS ( my training as a physician helps me see through this one . )
The Bohemian Grove–perverted , pagan playground of the powerful .
Skull & Bones : the demonic fraternity that includes George Bush and leftist Senator John Kerry , Congress ’s Mr. New Money .
The Israeli lobby , which plays Congress like a cheap harmonica
Source For Ron Paul ’s Newsletter Statements
While Paul has abandoned writing and distributing racist literature , he is still strongly connected to the Neo - Nazi movement .
It seems as if people in the white supremacist , Neo -Nazi community believe that Paul is one of them .
Paul is usually somewhere between David Duke , who refers to Paul as “ Our King , ” and Hitler on the Neo - Nazi hero list .
Ron Paul accepted a donation from the founder of white supremacist site , Stormfront , Don Black and even took a picture with him and his son Derek .
Ron Paul has been endorsed by David Duke and Sean Hannity ’s Nazi cohort , Hal Turner
Several prominent Ron Paul Internet organizers are also notorious Neo -Nazis .
Will Williams , also known as white will was a prominent internet organizer for the Paul campaign .
He also the Southern Coordinator for Turner Diaries ’ author , William Pierce ’s National Alliance .
Another one is Ron Doggett .
Doggett , a David Duke underling posts Ron Paul propaganda on various Neo - Nazi website , such as Stormfront and Vanguard News .
Another KKK member who organized for Paul was Randy Grey , the Midland County , Michigan coordinator for the Ron Paul 2008 Presidential campaign who was also a leader for the Michigan KKK .
Ron Paul Believes
In The John Birch “ New World Order ” Conspiracy Theory
Asides from the racism , Paul has inherited other ideologies from the John Birch society .
Ron Paul has several times alluded that he believes in the John Birch conspiracy theory , that a communist secret society conspiracy is seeking to bring the world into “ New World Order ” one world government and destroy America .
Another one of Ron Paul ’s supporters is Alex Jones .
Jones is a radio host who has extensively promoted the John Birch “ New World Order ” conspiracy of an Illuminati secret society trying to bring the world into a socialist one world government .
Jones has enthusiastically endorsed Ron Paul for President and has even has Paul on his radio show several times .
Rather than discourage Jones conspiracy theories , Paul encourages them .
On Jones show , Paul said .
A world central bank , worldwide regulation and world control of the whole system , of all the commodities and all the natural resources , what else can you call it other than world government ?
We have to continue to do what we are doing , you are in the business of passing on and spreading information , that , to me , is most crucial , getting more people engaged , more people understanding what the issues are , nothing else is more important than that .
Then when you see an opportunity we have to turn this into political action .

Ron Paul even used the phrase “ New World Order ” in a rally in Nashville , equating it with the UN , World Bank and IMF .
When asked “ Is there a plan for a New World Order and how do we stop it , ” Paul stayed to his John Birch philosophy and ranted against the U.N .
The first President Bush said the New World Order was in tune– and that ’s what they were working for .
The U.N. is part of that government .
They ’re working right now very significantly towards a North American Union .
That ’s why there ’s a lot of people in Washington right now who do n’t care too much about our borders .
They have a philosophical belief that national sovereignty is not important .
It ’s also the reason I ’ve made the very strong suggestion the U.S. need not be in the U.N. for national security reasons .
Ron Paul has denied he is racist and said that he did n’t write the many racist statements in the newsletter that was distributed in his name under his byline .
The Magazine that originally uncovered the racist newsletters responded with .
To believe that Ron Paul had no knowledge of what was being written in his own name , in his own office , for 20 years — and that he did n’t even read his own monthly publication — not only “ stretches credulity to the breaking point , ” it actually requires believing bald - faced lies .
In the statement about the coming race war and the homosexual AIDS plot , Paul clearly identified himself as a “ physician ” making it seem clear that Paul had the same racist , anti-Semitic , conspiratorial views of his fellow John Birch Society members .
A now incarcerated Neo -Nazi by the name of Bill White put out a statement that Ron Paul was a man with Neo - Nazi views , but he hid them because of his political position .
I have kept quiet about the Ron Paul campaign for a while , because I did n’t see any need to say anything that would cause any trouble .
However , reading the latest release from his campaign spokesman , I am compelled to tell the truth about Ron Paul ’s extensive involvement in white nationalism .
Both Congressman Paul and his aides regularly meet with members of the Stormfront set , American Renaissance , the Institute for Historic Review , and others at the Tara Thai restaurant in Arlington , Virginia , usually on Wednesdays .
This is part of a dinner that was originally organized by Pat Buchanan , Sam Francis and Joe Sobran , and has since been mostly taken over by the Council of Conservative Citizens .
I have attended these dinners , seen Paul and his aides there , and been invited to his offices in Washington to discuss policy .
For his spokesman to call white racialism a “ small ideology ” and claim white activists are “ wasting their money ” trying to influence Paul is ridiculous .
Paul is a white nationalist of the Stormfront type who has always kept his racial views and his views about world Judaism quiet because of his political position .
I do n’t know that it is necessarily good for Paul to “ expose ” this .
However , he really is someone with extensive ties to white nationalism and for him to deny that in the belief he will be more respectable by denying it is outrageous — and I hate seeing people in the press who denounce racialism merely because they think it is not fashionable .
Bill White , Commander Source
There are far to many connections between Ron Paul and white supremacists to be overlooked .
From his close affiliation to the Neo - Nazi breeding ground , The John Birch society , to the large number of Neo - Nazis who support and organize for him , to the racist literature he wrote and or distributed for almost 20 years between 1978 and 1995 .
Ron Paul is clearly a right wing extremist from the John Birch Society school of thought .
Most of his policies and views come from their conspiracy theory , from his opposition to the U.N. and Civil Rights legislation , to his homophobia and anti-Semitism .
He clearly believes in or chooses to spread the paranoia based New World Order , Illuminati theory that the John Birch society has spreading to militias and Neo - Nazis for so many years .
Given all the evidence it is very easy to believe Bill White ’s claim that Paul has been keeping his racist views quiet in order to infiltrate mainstream politics .
While it may seem that Ron Paul is a good decent man with strong political ideals , that is n’t racist , who is being supported by Neo - Nazis and Patriot movement militia people who wrongly believe that he is one of them , the opposite is true .
Ron Paul is a man with Neo - Nazi , Patriot movement militia views who is being supported by good decent people with strong political ideals who wrongly believe he is one of them .

Welcome to my home : first attempts at using Unity3D for architectural visualization
[ UPDATE : We have now published an eBook about Architectural Visualization with Unity3D ( including a chapter about Oculus Rift ) that can be purchased HERE . ]
Chez Keystone !
Come on in …( plugin required ) .
This is n’t multi-user ( yet ) , and navigation might take some getting used to , but this is an Autodesk Revit ‘ as - built ’ model of my home , imported into the Unity game development platform I wrote about last week .
If I make a change in Revit and save it , the Unity build dynamically updates .
With the exception of the trees , this is pretty much a raw output from Revit without any optimization ( which is why it looks so crude ) .
If I spent a few hours on it , I could add dynamic lighting and even import lightmaps to really enhance the model .
I can also export it to Nintendo Wii , iPhone or a variety of other platforms if I really wanted to , but at this point , I do n’t have the necessity or resources to do so .
I should add a disclaimer that we did n’t design this house , but we are planning a green make - over in several stages in the months and years ahead , so we ’ve been using this model to test master plan ideas .
I have n’t built or enabled access to the interior spaces , but I will soon .
This is just a starting point for design exploration , so even though I do n’t have much to demo yet , I wanted to share some of my initial progress and publish updates with more thoughts on what I ’ve learned about using Unity in professional practice .
What I like most about Unity so far is the ability to quickly and easily embed the virtual model on a web browser , or to a stand - alone .exe application if need be .
This makes it much easier to share design ideas with long distance clients that might not have the time or patience to deal with a registration process , large client downloads and orientation of larger virtual worlds .
Once they get the hang of using their mouse and arrow keys , just about anyone , even on lower end machines , can be walking around inside of a design concept within a few seconds .
When the time comes to add additional details and entourage , I simply save most raw file - types in their native format to the Assets folder of the project .
Unity then automatically finds updates if I change the model in its native application ( Maya , 3DS Max , Photoshop , etc. ) .
What I find doubly enticing about this work - flow is that I can transition my assets into any platform I choose without being locked into a proprietary format .
For example , if / when Second Life enables mesh imports , I should be able to take these same raw assets and use them in SL , or Blue Mars , or on whichever platform I wish – without having to rebuild everything from scratch .
I will then be able to choose which virtual platform is most appropriate for the project ’s requirements .
I also like the fact that the indie version of Unity is free to download and use .
Plus , its relatively easy to learn – much easier than any other 3D app I ’ve worked with .
Also , there is a rapidly growing community of Unity users and support forums to find answers to just about any question you have , and lots of in - depth tutorials to help you get started .
With several companies building MMO ’s or virtual worlds on Unity , it probably wo n’t be long before I can drop this model into a virtual world for multi-user , and avatar - based experiences .
However , I do n’t think we will see realtime , in - world building tools in Unity the way we have in Second Life , or OpenSim .
Unity was n’t designed or intended to be used that way .
I also think that any Unity worlds that do surface will likely be smaller , niche communities .
For those reasons and more , I really do n’t see Unity as any threat or comparison to Second Life or OpenSim .
However , for online , realtime , virtual architectural visualization , Unity is definitely a platform worth exploring .

Austin , Texas ( CNN ) --
The popular news - sharing site Digg is getting an overhaul that will personalize results , dramatically expand content and , most importantly , make the site " wicked fast , " according to its makers .
Digg CEO Jay Adelson said Sunday that the changes could increase the site 's shared content from about 20,000 submissions a day to millions a day .
At the same time , users will get home pages personalized to their interests .
Leader boards -- discontinued after complaints from new users and veterans -- will return , with more categories .
" It 's going to be a pretty radical set of changes , " said Adelson , who first announced the changes at a party hosted by the bookmarking site Saturday night during the South By Southwest Interactive festival in Austin , Texas .
Users interested in testing the new Digg can apply by going to the new site .
Adelson said people will start getting invitations in the next few weeks and that the site -- with revisions suggested by alpha- testers -- will open to the public in a few months .
Founded in 2004 , Digg allows its devoted set of users to submit a news story or other item that they like .
Other users then vote to " digg " or " bury " that item .
The stories that get the most love each day are rewarded with a potential traffic bonanza -- placement on Digg 's home page in front of its 40 million or so monthly users .
Like most popular social destinations on the Web , the site has attracted its share of controversy .
Some have complained that Digg 's user - driven rankings give too much prominence to misleading or sensationalistic articles .
The site also was forced to crack down on users who planted phony stories on behalf of marketers .
A key change with the new site will be removing the need to be logged in to Digg to submit an item .
Anyone on the Internet now will be able to put a story in front of Digg voters .
That 's the reason the site expects so many more submissions .
There also will be an unlimited number of topics , helping hobbies , local news and other niche interests that may never make it onto Digg 's home page find a place on the site .
" If you think about Digg right now , if you put a Digg button on [ a Web page ] it 's kind of like gambling in that if you hit , you hit big , " he said .
" But if you do n't hit , there 's not a lot of value .
" We 're trying to address that as a tool and say that ... I should be able to send a predictable amount of traffic to those sort of smaller and medium - tier sites . "
The site 's speed will be enhanced by an infrastructure overhaul that Adelson said has been five years in the making .
The homepage 's leader boards will return in revamped form , this time awarding users who share content in a particular field of interest .
Before , the game aspect of trying to reach the top of a single leader board was unpopular with new users , who felt they could never catch up , and the top users , who reported being offered money by Web sites to put their " Digg " clout behind their sites ' posts .
" You had the people actually at the top of the list telling us they did n't like the list , " Adelson said .
" That 's generally a good sign that a feature is broken . "

Has Our Government Spent $ 21 Trillion Of Our Money Without Telling Us ?
December 8 , 2017 , Forbes
https://www.forbes.com/sites/kotlikoff/2017/12/08/has-our-government-spent-21...
On July 26 , 2016 , the Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) issued a report “ Army General Fund Adjustments Not Adequately Documented or Supported ” .
The report indicates that for fiscal year 2015 the Army failed to provide adequate support for $ 6.5 trillion .
Given that the entire Army budget in fiscal year 2015 was $ 120 billion , unsupported adjustments were 54 times the level of spending authorized by Congress .
An appendix to the July 2016 report shows $ 2 trillion in changes to the Army General Fund balance sheet due to unsupported adjustments .
On the asset side , there is $ 794 billion increase in the Army 's Fund Balance with the U.S. Treasury .
There is also an increase of $ 929 billion in the Army 's Accounts Payable .
What is the source of the additional $ 794 billion in the Army 's Fund Balance ?
The July 2016 report is not the only such report of unsubstantiated adjustments .
Mark Skidmore and Catherine Austin Fitts , former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , conducted a search of government websites and found similar reports dating back to 1998 .
While the documents are incomplete , original government sources indicate $ 21 trillion in unsupported adjustments have been reported for the Department of Defense and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the years 1998 - 2015 .
[ And why ] after Mark Skidmore began inquiring about OIG - reported unsubstantiated adjustments , [ was ] the OIG 's webpage , which documented , albeit in a highly incomplete manner , these unsupported " accounting adjustments , " ... mysteriously taken down ?

The War On Waste
January 29 , 2002 , CBS News

On Sept. 10 [ 2001 ] , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declared war .
Not on foreign terrorists , " the adversary 's closer to home .
It 's the Pentagon bureaucracy . "
He said money wasted by the military poses a serious threat .
Rumsfeld promised change but the next day — Sept. 11 — the world changed and in the rush to fund the war on terrorism , the war on waste seems to have been forgotten .
Just last week President Bush announced , " my 2003 budget calls for more than $ 48 billion in new defense spending . "
More money for the Pentagon ... while its own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25 percent of what it spends .
" According to some estimates we cannot track $ 2.3 trillion in transactions , " Rumsfeld admitted .
$ 2.3 trillion –that 's $ 8,000 for every man , woman and child in America .
A former Marine turned whistle - blower is risking his job by speaking out ... about the millions he noticed were missing from one defense agency 's balance sheets .
Jim Minnery , Defense Finance and Accounting Service ... tried to follow the money trail , even crisscrossing the country looking for records .
" The director looked at me and said ' Why do you care about this stuff ? '
It took me aback .
My supervisor asking me why I care about doing a good job , " said Minnery .
He was reassigned and says officials then covered up the problem .
The Pentagon 's Inspector General " partially substantiated " several of Minnery 's allegations .

U.S. Army fudged its accounts by trillions of dollars , auditor finds
August 19 , 2016 , CNBC / Reuters
http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/19/reuters-america-us-army-fudged-its-accounts...
The United States Army 's finances are so jumbled it had to make trillions of dollars of improper accounting adjustments to create an illusion that its books are balanced .
The Defense Department ’s Inspector General ... said the Army made $ 2.8 trillion in wrongful adjustments to accounting entries in one quarter alone in 2015 , and $ 6.5 trillion for the year .
The amounts dwarf the Defense Department ’s entire budget .
The " forced " adjustments rendered the statements useless because " DoD and Army managers could not rely on the data in their accounting systems when making management and resource decisions . "
[ This ] is the latest example of the severe accounting problems plaguing the Defense Department for decades .
As a result , there has been no way to know how the Defense Department – far and away the biggest chunk of Congress ’ annual budget – spends the public ’s money .
" Where is the money going ?
Nobody knows , " said Franklin Spinney , a retired military analyst for the Pentagon .
For years , the Inspector General - the Defense Department 's official auditor - has inserted a disclaimer on all military annual reports .
The accounting is so unreliable that " the basic financial statements may have undetected misstatements that are both material and pervasive . "
DFAS [ Defense Finance and Accounting Services ] also could not make accurate year - end Army financial statements because more than 16,000 financial data files had vanished from its computer system .
Note : $ 6.5 trillion is the equivalent of $ 20,000 for every citiizen of the US .
If any business or other branch of government had balance sheets like this , it would be all over the news with people demanding reform .
Why does the military get away with this year after year ?

US ' fails to account ' for Iraq reconstruction billions
July 27 , 2010 , CBS News
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10774002
A US federal watchdog has criticised the US military for failing to account properly for billions of dollars it received to help rebuild Iraq .
The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction says the US Department of Defence is unable to account properly for 96 % of the money .
Out of just over $ 9bn , $ 8.7bn is unaccounted for , the inspector says .
Much of the money came from the sale of Iraqi oil and gas , and some frozen Saddam Hussein - era assets were also sold off .
The money was in a special fund administered by the US Department of Defense , the Development Fund for Iraq ( DFI ) , and was earmarked for reconstruction projects .
But the report says that a lack of proper accounting and poor oversight makes it impossible to say exactly what happened to most of it .
" The breakdown in controls left the funds vulnerable to inappropriate uses and undetected loss , " the report said .
This is not the first time that allegations of missing billions have surfaced in relation to the US - led invasion of Iraq and its aftermath .
In 2005 , the inspector general criticised the Coalition Provisional Authority , the US - led occupation administration , for its management of an $ 8.8 bn fund that belonged to the Iraqi government .
A criminal investigation conducted led to the conviction of eight US officials on bribery , fraud and money - laundering charges .
Why the Pentagon 's accounting fixes end up broken
December 23 , 2013 , CNBC / Reuters
http://www.cnbc.com/id/101293095
http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part3
The Defense Department has launched 20 or more projects to build modern business - management systems since the late 1990s .
At least five were subsequently killed as complete failures after billions of dollars were spent on them .
With each failure , a pattern emerges :
An off - the - shelf product with a proven track record in the private sector is chosen and then modified to the point where it does n't work properly .
The Pentagon is unable to account for itself , and thus for roughly half of all congressionally approved annual federal spending .
Interviews with scores of current and former defense officials , contractors and Pentagon watchers , as well as a review of dozens of reports by oversight agencies , show that the Pentagon is continually thwarted by a lack of accountability for failures ... and an incentive to spend .
All other federal agencies are audited annually ... and with rare exceptions , they pass every year .
The Pentagon alone has never been audited , leaving roughly $ 8.5 trillion in taxpayer dollars unaccounted for since 1996 .
The Pentagon has for years kept lousy books with impunity .
The 2009 law requiring the Defense Department to be audit - ready by 2017 provides for no penalties if it misses the deadline .
From 1995 through 2002 , Senator Charles Grassley pushed through an amendment to the annual defense appropriations bill requiring the Pentagon to account for its expenditures by following one seemingly simple procedure : match each payment to the expense it covered .
The order was ignored , and Grassley gave up .
There is no doubt that bad bookkeeping conceals movements of money that in some instances are illegal .
But because the Pentagon has never been audited , it is impossible to determine the frequency or extent of violations .

Many military officers illegally rake in tons of money with false contracts which benefit those officers and contracting companies .
They obviously do n't want their accounts to be properly audited .

Behind the Pentagon 's doctored ledgers , a running tally of epic waste
November 18 , 2013 , CNBC / Reuters
http://www.cnbc.com/id/101206230
Linda Woodford spent the last 15 years of her career inserting phony numbers in the U.S. Department of Defense 's accounts .
Woodford and her fellow [ accountants ] set about preparing monthly reports to square the Navy 's books with the U.S. Treasury 's .
And every month ... numbers were missing .
Numbers were clearly wrong .
Woodford and her colleagues were told by superiors to ... enter false numbers , commonly called " plugs , " to make the Navy 's totals match the Treasury 's .
Fudging the accounts with false entries is standard operating procedure .
Former military service officials say record - keeping at the operational level throughout the services is rife with made - up numbers to cover lost or missing information .
Plugs also are symptomatic of one very large problem : the Pentagon 's chronic failure to keep track of its money –how much it has , how much it pays out and how much is wasted or stolen .
The Defense Department 's 2012 budget totaled $ 565.8 billion , more than the annual defense budgets of the 10 next largest military spenders combined , including Russia and China .
How much of that money is spent as intended is impossible to determine .
The Pentagon is largely incapable of keeping track of its vast stores of weapons , ammunition and other supplies .
It has amassed a backlog of more than half a trillion dollars in unaudited contracts with outside vendors .
[ It ] also has systematically ignored warnings about its accounting practices .
The Pentagon is the only federal agency that has not complied with a law that requires annual audits of all government departments .
That means that the $ 8.5 trillion in taxpayer money doled out by Congress to the Pentagon since 1996 ... has never been accounted for .
That sum exceeds the value of China 's economic output last year .
A single [ military accounting ] office in Columbus , Ohio , made at least $ 1.59 trillion - yes , trillion - in errors , including $ 538 billion in plugs .

Defense Department drops $ 100 M on unused airline tickets
June 9 , 2004 , USA Today / New York Times / Associated Press
http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2004-06-09-pentagon-flights_x.htm
The Defense Department spent an estimated $ 100 million for airline tickets that were not used over a six - year period and failed to seek refunds even though the tickets were reimbursable .
The GAO estimated that between 1997 and 2003 , the Defense Department bought at least $ 100 million in tickets that were not used or used only partially by a passenger who did not complete all legs of a flight .
The waste went undetected because the department relied on individuals to report the unused tickets .
They did not do so .
" The millions of dollars wasted on unused airline tickets provides another example of why DOD financial management is one of our high - risk areas , with DOD highly vulnerable to fraud , waste and abuse , " the GAO said .
Two of the three lawmakers who asked for the study were Republicans , and both were highly critical of the Pentagon 's lack of financial control .
Sen. Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , said , " It 's outrageous that the Defense Department would be sending additional federal tax dollars to the airlines by way of unused passenger tickets . "
While one GAO report focused on the unused tickets , the second investigation found potential fraud .
It said the department paid travelers for tickets the department already bought and reimbursed employees for tickets that had not been authorized .
It is a crime for a government employee knowingly to request reimbursement for goods and services he or she did not buy .
To demonstrate how easy it was to have the Pentagon pay for airline travel , the investigators posed as Defense employees , had the department generate a ticket and showed up at the ticket counter to pick up a boarding pass .

Military waste under fire : $ 1 trillion missing
May 18 , 2003 , San Francisco Chronicle ( San Francisco 's leading newspaper )
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/05/18/MN251738.DTL
The Department of Defense , already infamous for spending $ 640 for a toilet seat ... could n't account for more than a trillion dollars in financial transactions , not to mention dozens of tanks , missiles and planes .
The nonpartisan General Accounting Office has raised the volume of its perennial complaints about the financial woes at Defense , which recently failed its seventh audit in as many years .
" Overhauling DOD 's financial management operations represent a challenge that goes far beyond financial accounting , " GAO chief David Walker told lawmakers .
Recent government reports suggest the Pentagon 's money management woes have reached astronomical proportions .
A GAO report found Defense inventory systems so lax that the U.S. Army lost track of 56 airplanes , 32 tanks , and 36 Javelin missile command launch - units .
When military leaders were scrambling to find enough chemical and biological warfare suits to protect U.S. troops , the department was caught selling these suits as surplus on the Internet " for pennies on the dollar , " a GAO official said .
" We are overhauling our financial management system , " said Dov Zakheim , the Pentagon 's chief financial officer .
" The Pentagon has failed to address financial problems that dwarf those of Enron , " said Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles .
Gregory Kutz , director of GAO 's financial management division [ said ]
" I 've been to Wal - Mart .
They were able to tell me how many tubes of toothpaste were in Fairfax , Va . And DOD can't find its chem-bio suits . "
Opposition to defense spending is portrayed as unpatriotic .
Legislators are often more concerned about winning Pentagon pork than controlling defense waste .

Google 's European sales chief says that desktop PCs will be " irrelevant " in three years .
This week , as reported by Silicon Republic , Google Europe boss John Herlihy told a " baffled " conference audience that very soon the smartphone will completely eclipse the desktop .
" In three years time , desktops will be irrelevant , " he said .
" In Japan , most research is done today on smart phones , not PCs . "
Like Eric Schmidt at last month 's Mobile World Conference in Barcelona , Herlihy was trying to say that Google 's number one concern is now the mobile market .
" Mobile makes the world ’s information universally accessible .
Because there ’s more information and because it will be hard to sift through it all , that ’s why search will become more and more important .
This will create new opportunities for new entrepreneurs to create new business models – ubiquity first , revenue later . ”
But Eric Schmidt did not say that the desktop PC would be irrelevant in three years .
He did say that Google does n't want to turn wireless carriers into dumb pipes - which is arguably more ridiculous .
Google 's one great achievement over the past few years is its carefully executed plan to loosen the carriers ' vice - grip on their networks .
This certainly benefits Google - but it also benefits Joe Netizen .
With his speech in Dublin , Herlihy went on to discuss what he sees as the reasons for Google 's " business success " .
In his mind , Google succeeds because of its " relentless brutality and execution , " its determination to hire the best people , and its decision to " celebrate failure " .
" Here ’s an analogy – the Roman legions used to send out scouts in different directions , " he said .
" If a scout did n’t return , the army did n’t head in that direction .
We seek feedback at every opportunity on something – we either kill it , adjust it or redeploy resources .
" When we build something we strive for ubiquity in usage and adoption .
That helps us understand how customers react and then we build a revenue model . "
Of course , you could argue that Google has built only one successful revenue model - selling online ads against keywords - and that it has spent the rest of its time trying to shoehorn the same model into as many new services as it can .
But it 's much more fun to chuckle at the desktop PC bit . ®

I ’ve kept silent about Yemen so far because I do n’t want to even begin to pretend that I know anything about the place .
But , like everyone else , I ’ve been reading about it , and I have to say that this paragraph from Richard Fontaine and Andrew Exum is probably the most enlightening one I ’ve seen so far :
Yemen ’s economy depends heavily on oil production , and its government receives the vast majority of its revenue from oil taxes .
Yet analysts predict that the country ’s petroleum output , which has declined over the last seven years , will fall to zero by 2017 .
The government has done little to plan for its post - oil future .
Yemen ’s population , already the poorest on the Arabian peninsula and with an unemployment rate of 35 % , is expected to double by 2035 .
An incredible 45 % of Yemen ’s population is under the age of 15 .
These trends will exacerbate large and growing environmental problems , including the exhaustion of Yemen ’s groundwater resources .
Given that a full 90 % of the country ’s water is used for agriculture , this trend portends disaster .
So Yemen ’s population has tripled since 1975 and will double again by 2035 .
Meanwhile , state revenue will decline to zero by 2017 and the capital city of Sanaa will run out of water by 2015 — partly because 40 % of Sanaa ’s water is pumped illegally in the outskirts to irrigate the qat crop .
Bizarrely , even after writing this , Fontaine and Exum follow up with this :
Given the threat posed not just by terrorism but by the potential for nationwide instability , the United States should move toward a broader relationship with Yemen , still focusing strongly on counter - terrorism but also on economic development and improved governance … .
Over the weekend , Obama pledged to double aid to Yemen , but this money must be spent strategically .
Several areas are ripe for foreign help , including training and equipping counter - terrorism forces , bolstering border security and building the capacity of the coast guard , expanding counterinsurgency advice to the Yemeni government and expanding programs focused on basic governance and anti-corruption .
Even though they say that economic development is important , nearly their entire list is dedicated to military aid of one kind or another .
1
But it ’s hard to see what good that will do to help a country with a soaring population , no revenue , and a rapidly dwindling water supply .
Frankly , it ’s a little hard to see how anything is likely to have much impact on a country with problems that severe .
And until those problems are addressed , it ’s also hard to see how even the best designed and executed counterterrorism program can have more than a very limited effect .
More here from Marc Lynch , who basically seems to agree : “ So what should the U.S. do ?
Pretty much what it ’s been doing in the Obama administration , which has in fact been thinking seriously about Yemen all year and which has quietly been working there in some constructive and some unconstructive ways .
It ’s never as satisfying as a morally pure call to battle . [… ]
But the administration should n’t fall into the trap of thinking it must “ do something ” to fend off political harping from the right and end up over - committing … or taking steps which ultimately make the situation worse . ”
1 There ’s more detail in the policy brief that their op - ed is drawn from , but it ’s still focused almost exclusively on military and counterterrorism programs .
WASHINGTON — Ending one of the fiercest lobbying fights in Washington , Congress voted Thursday to force commercial banks out of the federal student loan market , cutting off billions of dollars in profits in a sweeping restructuring of financial - aid programs and redirecting most of the money to new education initiatives .
The revamping of student - loan programs was included in — if overshadowed by — the final health care package .
The vote was 56 to 43 in the Senate and 220 to 207 in the House , with Republicans unanimously opposed in both chambers .
Since the bank - based loan program began in 1965 , commercial banks like Sallie Mae and Nelnet have received guaranteed federal subsidies to lend money to students , with the government assuming nearly all the risk .
Democrats have long denounced the program , saying it fattened the bottom line for banks at the expense of students and taxpayers .
“ Why are we paying people to lend the government ’s money and then the government guarantees the loan and the government takes back the loan ? ” said Representative George Miller , Democrat of California and chairman of the Education and Labor Committee .

This is the same CBS that has repeatedly refused to run advocacy ads from progressive groups like MoveOn.org .
This is the same CBS that built a then - unparalleled reputation back in the day for its tough , ethical , truth - to - power brand of TV News Journalism .
And now this CBS has not only sold an extremist religious group a half - minute of the most high - impact broadcast television airtime the medium has to offer - no , reports indicate that this CBS also helped Focus On The Family write its ad copy .
Just a helpful " spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down " kind of a thing , no doubt .
From Edward R. Murrow to Walter Cronkite to Don Hewitt - there must be an awful lot of " spinning in the grave " action going on in that CBS Newsroom somewhere in the Great Beyond .
Yes , that was the News division , and yes , this new policy and the way it 's being launched are decisions being made by the Business division .
And yes , CBS is a private , for - profit company that has a right to make its money in any way it sees fit .
Yet one would think that in addition to all the desperate bean - counters , there might still be a few stalwarts left at the network with the intelligence and integrity to ask :
What about the damage being done to what for so long has been an honorable brand ?
What about damage to the notion that one of the few " free " broadcast networks left should answer to a slightly higher calling in its rightful pursuit of profits ?

Two bank robbery suspects , including one dressed in a green leprechaun costume , have been shot dead after a St Patrick 's Day chase and shootout with police in Tennessee .
A police spokesman said First State Bank in the Nashville suburb of Gallatin was held up by a costumed man carrying a large gun yesterday afternoon .
The man fled the bank with an undisclosed amount of cash and jumped into a waiting car driven by the other man .
The police spokesman said the suspects fired at police during a car chase .
At least one shot hit a police car , causing it to stop .
The two fugitives then ran into a field and were killed during a shootout with officers .
The stolen money was recovered from the getaway car .
Police said no one else was hurt .
Sharon Riehemann , manager of the Fifth Third Bank next door , said she saw a man in a green top hat , vest and shorts and a fake beard run away from First State Bank with a blue bag in his hands .
She said he had just been in her bank but left without speaking .
" He started to come in , then looked at his watch , then turned around and left , " she said .
He walked toward the other bank , and then a couple of minutes later he ran out of the bank with a blue bag in his hands , Ms Riehemann said .
Police are still trying to identify the two men .
The officers involved in the shooting are on administrative duty while the investigation continues .
Last December , a man wearing a Santa Claus suit - including hat , beard and moustache - held up a SunTrust Bank in Nashville , demanding money from the teller at gunpoint .
No arrests were made in that case .

Helping to solve the scrapheap challenge ( Image : Surrey Space Centre )
The first spacecraft designed to do away with itself was unveiled on Friday .
It will try out an idea that could stop space getting clogged up with junk orbiting the Earth .
The debris of abandoned spacecraft and satellites is building up in low Earth orbit .
This zero -g scrapheap has grown by 40 per cent in the past four years alone , with the US air force now tracking 19,000 orbiting objects larger than 10 centimetres across .
And as chunks of debris strike each other , they fragment further – presenting still more threat of collision to working spacecraft .
The diminutive CubeSail craft , measuring 30 by 10 by 10 centimetres and weighing just 3 kilograms , has been designed at the Surrey Space Centre at the University of Surrey in Guildford , UK .
It has a solar sail that it can use for propulsion – harnessing the pressure of sunlight , just as a boat ’s sail harnesses the pressure of the wind – but it can also use the sail as an “ orbital brake ” to help it de-orbit to a fiery death in the atmosphere .
Advertisement
Splice the mainbrace
CubeSail , funded by the pan-European aerospace company EADS Astrium , will be launched into low Earth orbit late next year .
At an altitude of 700 kilometres , the “ nanosatellite ” will unfurl its 5 - by - 5 metre sail , initially to test its usefulness for propulsion .
But after that experiment is complete , says Surrey Space Centre ’s project chief Vaios Lappas , the solar sail will be turned away from the sun and its efficiency as an orbital brake will be tested .
Even at this high altitude there are rarefied molecules of the Earth ’s atmosphere , and drag from those molecules eventually slows satellites in low Earth orbit enough to bring them to destruction in a blazing re-entry through the thicker layers of the atmosphere below .
The sail should increase that drag and send the craft to its doom all the sooner : instead of taking decades to de-orbit , it could take just a couple of years .
If CubeSail works , future satellites could be fitted with similar sails that would be deployed when their useful life ends and they become space junk , says Lappas .
Or swarms of CubeSails could be flown into orbit , attach themselves to space junk and help de-orbit it faster .
Stuck in space
But the history of spacecraft that unfurl or inflate devices in orbit is not a happy one : components often fail or get stuck .
The Surrey team hopes that the novel mechanism of spring - loaded steel booms that is to deploy its sail will work as well in space as it has on Earth .
“ We have tested them at 1 g but not at zero g , ” says Lappas .
“ That ’s the challenge we face . ”
“ A US satellite called Aerocube 3 attempted to test an inflatable drag augmentation device last year .
However , the deployment was unsuccessful , ” says Nicholas Johnson at Johnson Space Center in Houston , Texas , NASA ‘s chief scientist for orbital debris .
“ Several earlier attempts to deploy solar sails and similar devices have also encountered problems . ”
Joanne Wheeler , a London - based lawyer specialising in space law , welcomes the move – but with a caveat .
“ Anything that can be done to alleviate the space debris issue is worth trying , ” she says .
“ But organisations have to realise that they cannot simply de-orbit any piece of debris they think poses a risk .
Even defunct satellites remain the lawful property of the launching country – so full permission from that state will be required . ”
And that , she says , will not be straightforward : there is currently no internationally agreed definition of space debris .

Re : Paul L. & Stolen Valor Act Turley 's certainly right on that Stolen Valor nonsense .
Anybody who supports that authoritarian flagwavery , ironically , steals the valor of every American who 's ever taken a stand in defense of the First Amendment .
What 's next , a law which prohibits lying about whether or not you supported the Iraq War ?
That was a collective act of cowardice which effectively sentenced thousands of American troops to death for petty political purposes , after all .

What in the world are you talking about ?
The right to a hearing in a court of law is one of the essential features of due process .
What is it you think they call the proceedings when attorneys appear before an appellate court to argue their case .
It 's called a " hearing . "
Now , if you are referring to " impeachment " hearings , it would be accurate to state that Congress is the only body that is authorized by the constitution to initiate them .

Just for the record , the FEC did n't actually " ban " anything , per se , as I understand it , but rather enforced the bi-partisan McCain - Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Act as passed by Congress and signed into law by George W. Bush .
It is the requirement of the FEC , as part of the Executive branch to enforce the laws passed by Congress and duly signed by the President .
If you believe the law was unconstitutional , that 's a separate matter and is decided in the Supreme Court where the five Republican - appointed justices seem to agree with you as much as I might disagree with * them * .
I do n't know what Turleys position on that ruling is , and I know I 've disagreed with him on many things in the past , so I can't speak to that for the moment ( especially from my iPhone ) but I know Glenn Greenwald , for example , who is * very * progressive , believes tHat SCOTUS was right in their decision as I recall .

The clarity Turley uses when discussing torture or Bush 's impeachment in and of itself disqualify him from even consideration , or so those doing the considering will reason .
Obama and Bush are on the same team , I thought that was clear here .
Even putting his name out for public vetting would not be looking forward enough .
When all those Attorneys General were illegaly fired Bush replaced them with some real doozies .
Has Obama cleaned house ?
Robert Gates ?
October suprise , Iran - Contra , drug running ... he stays on ?
Now Obama is threatening to veto intel budget legislation if it dares to request some clarification on the Anthrax charade .
Reps Holt and Nadler want to insert an ammendment requiring a look at the FBI 's handling of it , but oh my gosh , NO .... that would be terrible , so awful , so ... unspeakable I would veto funding for intelligence over it . ( yeah right ) I do n't know Turley 's position on most things either , but if we want someone with his moxie on the SC we need somebody from another team in the white house .
Democrat / Republican corporate whore team is entrenched and will stay so barring massive spreading of 9/11 truth .

The more important question is what we " the People " deserve .
We deserve better than the Federalist Society radicals in robes who place corporations and their profits above the health and very lies of our citizens .
We deserve a Supreme Court justice who understands the true meaning of the words inscribed on the entrance to the Supreme Court : Equal Justice Under Law We , " the People " deserve someone like Jonathan Turley ; someone actually committed to the rule of law .

Just looked at the link to Turley 's blog .
There were nine articles posted yesterday , March 16 .
The first was health - care bill related ( self - executing blah blah ) .
The other 8 were of the National Enquirer stripe .
Car thief gets locked in , man arrested after running 11 stop signs was on IPod and cell phone ( is that even possible ? ) , pastor on motorcycle in church ( complete w/ YouTube clip ... hot dog ! ) , Edwards affair , Restaurant sells whale meat .
Suffice to say his level of gravitas seems to be between Jerry Springer and Krusty the Clown .

OT : Dan Froomkin today on the ( intentionally racist ) felony disenfranchisement statutes still on the books in 48 states :
In Virginia , almost 7 % of the entire voting - age population is disenfranchised due to a past felony conviction ; and almost 20 % of the state 's African American population is locked out of the voting booth .
(?!
I did n't know that ! ) ... and guess who weighs in ?
... Two witnesses spoke in defense of the current system , including Hans von Spakovsky , whose claim to fame is his stint in the Bush Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division , where he turned the voting rights section 's mission on its head --- working to make it harder , not easier , for poor and minority voters to cast ballots ... ... Von Spakovsky said it was a matter of states ' rights .
And he both mocked and questioned the motivations of the bill 's sponsors : " Why does this bill not also amend federal law to allow them to once again own a handgun ?
Are we to believe that they can be trusted to vote but not to own a handgun ?
Are we to believe that the sponsors of this legislation think that a convicted child molester can be trusted to vote but cannot be trusted to be a teacher in a public school ?
Are we to believe a convicted drug dealer can be trusted to vote but cannot be trusted to be a police officer ?
Or is the true motivation here based more on the fact that their vote is important to winning close elections ? "

My family also insists that this blog does not reflect their views and would like to officially state that they disown all that is here .
The authors of this blog also reserve the right to contradict themselves frequently .
In other words , this blog is worth the money you paid to view it .
I normally really , really , really hate disability simulations .
But I ca n’t think of a way to make this point more clear , and I think that there are cases in which disability simulations can actually be very helpful for people who are having trouble grasping some key concepts .
Food policing is an area in which all sorts of assumptions are made about class and ability status .
It goes hand in hand with the idea that people have an obligation to be healthy , that all bodies are the same so there ’s only one way to be healthy , and that there is virtue in eating “ right ” as dictated by current authorities in the food world .
Like , say , Michael Pollan , who is editorialized fawningly in numerous publications all over the planet for his “ simple ” and “ helpful ” food rules .
So .
Before you criticize the food choices of others …
Prepare a meal which takes an hour of being on your feet in the kitchen , with a 100 pound ( 45 kilogram ) sack of flour across your shoulders .
Welcome to an inkling of what it ’s like to try and prepare a meal when you have a condition which involves chronic pain and fatigue .
You have exactly half an hour to prepare dinner , with no help .
GO !
Bonus : Dinner for four .
Prepare a meal which does n’t include : Corn , wheat , eggs , nuts , bell peppers , fish of any kind , cheese , soy , milk , or peanuts .
If these ingredients slip in , say hello to your friend anaphylaxis .
You ca n’t hear kitchen timers or any other noises associated with food preparation ( like your pasta water boiling , the sizzle of meat searing , etc. ) .
How do you plan to gauge doneness or the appropriate timing for the next step in a recipe ?
Prepare a meal which does n’t include anything crunchy .
( Alternatives : Nothing with a strong odor , nothing soft , nothing slimy , nothing squeaky , nothing viscous , etc. )
For people with sensory sensitivity , both handling food to prepare it and eating it can be challenging .
You ’re hungry .
Wait five hours .
You ’re still hungry .
You ’re really hungry !
Wait two more hours .
You ’re still hungry , but you still ca n’t make yourself eat ( or you ca n’t prepare food , or you ca n’t go out for food , or you ca n’t afford to order in food ) .
Start cooking something .
Get distracted and leave the kitchen with water boiling / pan on high .
Come back half an hour later .
Now what ?
Prepare a meal which does n’t include heavy oil , spicing , flavoring , or strong ingredients .
Mess up ?
It ’s ok , you do n’t have irritable bowel , Crohn ’s , or other gastrointestinal conditions which would leave you writhing on the toilet for the rest of the night .
Sit on a low stool and try preparing food and cooking at counters which are all too high for you .
( You are allowed to prepare ahead of time by moving utensils to your level , as folks with kitchens which are too high tend to lay them out in a way which is accessible for them , even if they ca n’t afford the modifications needed to make a kitchen truly accessible . )
Wear heavy gloves or bandage your hands during food preparation .
This includes opening containers , chopping , and everything else .
Work in a kitchen which is extremely hot ( or cold ) .
Some folks with disabilities have poor temperature regulation which can make tasks like baking extra fun .
Try preparing a recipe out of order , or with missing steps .
Folks with attention and focus issues often have trouble following recipes , especially if they are complex .
Make a meal .
Look at it .
Feel ill and throw it away .
You still feel ill because you can smell it .
Take out the garbage .
You have no clean dishes .
Wash your dishes .
You are now too tired to cook .
Recognize that you are hungry and need food .
Realize that nothing in your house is suitable .
Go to bed hungry .
Furthermore …
People with disabilities are much more likely to live in poverty .
Do your grocery shopping for the week with $ 20 .
People with disabilities often lack access to big grocery stores ( no public transit , store is not accessible , do n’t have energy to go to the store after work ) .
Use the corner store for groceries .
For a week .
You ’re also only allowed to bring home as many groceries as you can carry in one bag .
If you ’re more of an eating out kind of person , do n’t go to any restaurants which fail to meet basic accessibility guidelines .
For bonus points , do n’t go to restaurants which are too bright , too dark , too crowded , too loud , too smelly .
Also , your budget for eating out has been reduced to 1/3 of what it usually is .
If you have a shared kitchen , only prepare meals when no one else is there , or eat in your room from food supplies you store there .
Some neuroatypical folks have a hard time navigating shared spaces .
Alternatively , if you have a shared kitchen , imagine that half your food has been eaten by housemates and you can only replace it with ingredients available from the corner store .
Another alternative :
You can cook in your shared kitchen , but only if someone has n’t recently cooked something which smells strong in there and if no strong smelling foods are stored there .
Incidentally , any soft goods ( like bread ) should be considered inedible if they ’ve been stored in a kitchen where people made strong - smelling food .
Oh , you just bought that loaf ?
Too bad .
This is just a small taste of what it can be like to eat while disabled .
I ’m sure that readers can add many things in the comments .
And I ’d note that many of these limitations also apply to people such as parents and able poor folks .
ETA : I do n’t know where all of the Michael Pollan apologists came from , but please stop .
I ’m not going to be letting your comments through , and they miss the larger point of this post , which is not to attack Michael Pollan , but to discuss trends in the foodie movement and beyond .
Jerry and Mary Neeley used to own the best video store on the east side of L.A .
That ’s where I met them , and since they closed shop two years ago to sell movie collectibles online , we ’ve occasionally met for coffee and talk of , among other topics , true crime .
We ’ve also kept in touch by e-mail , and last week Mary sent the following message :
As you know , the 40th anniversary of Tate / LaBianca is this August 8th & 9th .
( Technically , the 9th & 10th because both parties were killed after midnight . )
I wanted to go to the LaBianca house around 1 am on the 10th to see if anyone else shows up .
Would you be interested ?
I do n’t want to walk up there alone at 1am .
Yes , I wrote back , I was interested .
As her message indicates , she lives near the former residence of Rosemary and Leno LaBianca , who , around two in the morning on August 10 , 1969 , received a surprise visit from a hirsute , diminutive stranger — an erstwhile party guest at the house next door and a convicted pimp with a harem of runaway girls , some of whom were waiting in a white and yellow ’ 59 Ford parked at the curb .
Also in the Ford were a couple of boys who ’d been drawn to the diminutive man in part because they , too , were serviced by the harem .
They lived together , all of them , on a Western - town movie set on the outskirts of Los Angeles , where , under the influence of massive quantities of drugs , they were convinced that black militants aimed to destroy them , and the diminutive man , who called the shots , proposed to counterattack by perpetrating a series of gruesome murders and planting clues that would implicate the militants .
The diminutive man was Charles Manson , and the LaBiancas were fodder for his far - out blueprints .
The previous night , others had been killed , though Manson was n’t present .
Three of his retinue , including two who would participate in the LaBianca murders , invaded a house near Beverly Hills , where the actress Sharon Tate and four guests were shot , hung , stabbed , and bludgeoned .
Tate was famously pregnant at the time , and her blood was used to paint the word PIG as a “ clue ” on the front door .
The Tate residence , at the crest of Cielo Drive , was designed to look like a French farmhouse .
I went there a few times , though it could n’t be seen without scaling the gate or the embankment that concealed it .
I could just make out the edge of the garage , and once , from the top of a nearby hill , I got a good look at the roof , where workers were shingling , the reports of their hammers echoing across the canyon .
I repeatedly dreamed of being inside the house .
In my dreams , I ’d often see the headlights of the killers as they drew closer and closer , and I ’d rush about in a vain attempt to find and warn Tate and the others .
You ca n’t change history , I suppose those dreams were saying .
You ca n’t save what ’s impossible to save .
Nor could the house itself be saved .
It was torn down at some point in the nineties , and a McMansion was raised in its place .
The McMansion , as far as I know , has almost never been occupied , possibly due to superstition or fear of lookie - loos — a legitimate fear , though people continue to visit .
Last year a friend from Providence flew out to L.A. for the first time , and I asked if there was anything he particularly wanted see .
As a matter of fact , there was : the house on Cielo Drive .
I drove him to where it used to be and pointed to the telephone pole climbed by one of the killers to snip the wires before the murders commenced .
I also drove my friend to the LaBianca house , which has been renovated since the terrible events of 1969 .
The front lawn has largely been paved , and a heavy gate stands between the house and the rest of Waverly Drive .
According to Mary , who ’s something of a Manson - case expert , a visitor to the house , years after the murders , was shown the blood of the LaBiancas , which , though hidden by new carpeting , forever stained the floorboards .
*****
I picked up Mary on Sunday the 9th , just before midnight .
Jerry , who suffers from diabetes , was n’t feeling well , so he could n’t come with us , but I ’d invited two friends who live near Waverly to meet us there later .
I circled the LaBianca house and , seeing no other lookie - loos , drove to a 7 - Eleven , where Mary got a Coke and I got a coffee .
Then , returning to Waverly , we parked as close as possible to the spot where Manson had parked forty years before , and as soon as I cut the engine , we heard a heavy rattling sound and saw a man in silhouette chaining the gate in the LaBianca driveway .
Was that something the occupants did every night , or were they especially wary due to the anniversary ?
No matter ; we sat in the car and talked , waiting for possible others .
We were both struck by how quiet it was , and I was concerned about cops , since my car registration has lapsed , so we kept our voices low .
Every so often a car would appear , but none slowed as they passed the house , where the occupants had retired , or so I assumed .
All the windows were dark , but at this moment forty years before , some of the windows would ’ve been lit , since the LaBiancas had just returned home and Leno was reading the paper in the living room when Manson walked inside , possibly accompanied by his chief assassin , Tex Watson .
( Accounts differ as to when Watson entered the house .
Some say he helped Manson tie the LaBiancas , while others say Manson tied them alone and returned to the ’59 Ford , where Watson and the others were waiting to learn which of them would be selected to kill . )
And what story was Leno reading in the paper ?
Conceivably the one about the Tate murders .
Leno and his wife had bought the paper at a newsstand on their way home , and they had an exchange with the newsstand owner in which Mrs. LaBianca in particular expressed horror at the headline story .
Now , an hour later , she and her husband were about to meet those responsible .
The friends I ’d been expecting texted to say they were n’t coming , and I noticed a small , dancing light maybe fifty yards away .
I ’d brought along binoculars , which Mary trained on the light .
It was just a guy smoking , she said .
We continued to talk , and she told me a story I ’d never heard : when Manson strolled inside the LaBianca living room ( the door was unlocked ) , he saw a dog beside Leno on the couch and said , “ Who you got with you ?
Sophia Loren ? ”
“ I believe it , ” Mary said .
“ It sounds like something Manson would say . ”
It does for a fact .
Manson had a sense of humor , unlike Hitler , whose ideology formed part of the basis of Manson’s .
*****
Living in L.A. , I ’ve met several people who encountered Manson ’s victims and followers and others associated with the case .
My friend Harry , for instance , had a brush with Sharon Tate when he was a teenager and dining in London with film director Nicholas Ray and Ray ’s son Tim , whom Harry had befriended at school .
Ray , meantime , was friendly with Roman Polanski , who stopped by their table to say hello , and with him was Sharon Tate , whom he would later marry but was then his girlfriend , as well as his co-star in The Fearless Vampire Killers , which he was also directing .
At one point he and Ray broke off , leaving Tate alone with the boys , and though she sweetly did her best to engage them , her beauty rendered them mute .
The day before the massacre on Cielo Drive , my friend Burke ’s stepfather , Joel , had his hair cut by Tate ’s former boyfriend , Jay Sebring , who was killed while trying to protect her .
( Sebring was a noted men ’s hair stylist , responsible for Jim Morrison ’s lion mane ; and indeed , on the day Joel had his hair cut at Sebring ’s salon , a celebrity was on hand : Jim Backus , who played Thurston Howell III on Gilligan ’s Island . )
Francis Schwartz , a wonderful man who practiced law well into his eighties , often observed Manson ’s girls outside the downtown courthouse , where they daily held vigil during Manson ’s trial , shaving their heads and carving Xs on their brows to court attention .
My friend Michael once had lunch with Vincent Bugliosi , Manson ’s prosecutor and the co-author of Helter Skelter , the most celebrated account of the case .
Bugliosi was shocked when Michael told him he ’d read Helter Skelter by way of lifting his mood , but he chuckled at Michael ’s explanation : he ’d just been through a painful breakup and wanted to read about people who ’d suffered worse .
And there are others , including Eve Babitz , a terrific writer whose books , save one , are inexplicably out of print .
On separate occasions , Mary and I both spoke to Babitz , who attended grammar school with Catherine Share , the Manson girl known as Gypsy , and later became acquainted with Bobby Beausoleil , also known as Cupid , whose arrest for the murder of musician Gary Hinman sparked the Tate - LaBianca horrors .
“ He was really beautiful , ” Babitz said of Beausoleil , “ but he was such a downer .
We used to call him Bummer Bob . ”
Beausoleil , incidentally , was briefly in the band Love , and he and Gypsy appeared in a Western - themed nudie flick that ends with a man being fatally knifed by Beausoleil .
Gary Hinman was fatally knifed by Beausoleil , after having his ear nearly cut off by Manson .
Love , indeed .
*****
By 1:45 , it was starting to look like Mary and I were the only people curious enough to turn up at the LaBianca house .
And maybe that was a good thing — I was n’t sure how I ’d feel about somebody else doing what I was doing .
It was morbid , but I ’m not morbid typically , as Mary is n’t either , so I cut us both slack .
Besides , it was a bit like being in a movie about a stakeout at a haunted house — and if ever there were a house that deserved to be haunted , it ’s the one on Waverly Drive .
Headlights appeared at the far end of the street .
They slowly got closer , and the car came into view .
It was an eighties - model white Cadillac , and I glanced through the rolled - up windows as it moved past my car and saw four people — possibly teenagers — staring at the LaBianca house .
There was a girl in the backseat who seemed to be keeping her head down , as if afraid of being seen .
Then the Cadillac backed up and , halfway down the street , it began to move forward again , so obviously the people inside it must be looking for the house number , which had been changed years before to confuse the curious .
Yet , seeing the headlights slowly advance , I flashed back to my dreams of Cielo Drive : the killers getting closer and impossible to stop .
I was n’t scared , but I was spooked .
The Cadillac moved past us again , and I glanced at the girl in the back .
She was wearing a hooded sweatshirt , with the hood now covering her head , though she continued to duck .
The Cadillac idled for a moment by the LaBianca gate before it moved down the hill and disappeared .
I listened and heard a door slam shut — or at least I thought I did .
I asked Mary if she ’d heard anything .
We both listened to the deathly silence , and in my rear - view mirror I saw a silhouette walk up the hill and toward the house .
“ Someone ’s coming ! ” I said .
“ Shhhhhhh ! ” Mary said .
It was two people , actually .
I could n’t determine if they were male or female or one of each , but I could make out two shapes by the gate .
Then , for a split second , the house and the street close to it were filled with flashing light — the strobe of a camera — and a girl standing in front of the gate was illuminated .
She was n’t the one in the sweatshirt — or maybe she was , but she ’d left it in the Cadillac — and the person with the camera was a guy .
I decided it would be fun if I got out of the car , to possibly scare them or exchange a few words , and I did indeed get out , but they did n’t seem to notice or care .
They walked away in their own good time , two moving shapes in the darkness , and disappeared down the hill .
I never heard them speak — not even a whisper along the lines of : “ Got the shot ?
Here , let ’s take another . ”
Maybe they , too , were concerned about cops .
Or maybe they thought I was a cop .
But they managed to snap a picture of what had once been 3301 Waverly Drive at almost the precise minute when , forty years before , the unspeakable was occurring inside ; and just before I drove her home , Mary took a picture of her own .
*****
There ’s something uniquely L.A. about Manson : an aspiring rock star who lived on a movie set and , like a filmmaker , directed those eager to be molded .
I think that partly accounts for my interest in him : he embodies something about the city I ’ve come to call home .
But there ’s more to it than that .
In my novel , Banned for Life , the narrator speaks of visiting the Tate house and , expressing sorrow that it was later destroyed , he adds : “ In my view , considering the turning point it symbolized , it should have been preserved as a cultural landmark . ”
The narrator is n’t me — not entirely — but I agree with him about the Tate house ; and the “ turning point ” he mentions is the close of the sixties .
My friend George once said that “ the men who play golf ” were deeply shaken by the sixties , and took steps to make sure they were n’t repeated .
He was vague about those steps , but I ’m inclined to believe him , in part because it ’s obvious , to me at least , that Manson was used to frighten people already unsympathetic to youth culture .
Some called him the most dangerous man alive .
Really ?
Richard Nixon ’s body count exceeded Manson ’s by untold thousands .
Nixon and his ilk were the true bogeymen , but Manson looked the part as they did n’t — not to Joe Grabasandwich .
Meantime , there ’s only one other true - crime case that intrigues me as much as the Manson case : the JFK assassination .
For a long time , I saw no connection .
I was interested in the JFK case largely because of the enigma of Lee Harvey Oswald : did he do it or did n’t he ?
I was inclined to think he did — alone , in fact .
Then I had an exchange with my friend Demetri , who said , “ Well , if Oswald did it , you could say he started the sixties , just as Manson ended them . ”
So there was a connection .
It explained a great deal .
But not everything .
I think , finally , it goes back to Sharon Tate .
But for her , I probably would never have thought much about Manson .
She ’s the reason I dreamed about the house on Cielo Drive .
As a child , I thought Tate was the most beautiful woman who ever lived .
And that leads to another quote from my friend George .
We were talking about Greek mythology one night , and he said , “ You know , I do n’t think a lot of those stories are relevant anymore .
I mean , killing your father and fucking your mother and plucking out your eyes — that ’s a perfect myth for two thousand years ago .
But a beautiful blonde movie star being murdered at her mansion in the Hollywood Hills — now , there ’s a myth for our time . ”
And so in that way she stands , along with the house that used to be 3301 Waverly Drive .
A reedited version of this piece appears in the nonfiction collection Subversia .
The biggest open secret in the landmark trial over same - sex marriage being heard in San Francisco is that the federal judge who will decide the case , Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker , is himself gay .
Many gay politicians in San Francisco and lawyers who have had dealings with Walker say the 65 - year - old jurist , appointed to the bench by President George H.W. Bush in 1989 , has never taken pains to disguise - or advertise - his orientation .
They also do n't believe it will influence how he rules on the case he's now hearing - whether Proposition 8 , the 2008 ballot measure approved by state voters to ban same - sex marriage , unconstitutionally discriminates against gays and lesbians .
" There is nothing about Walker as a judge to indicate that his sexual orientation , other than being an interesting factor , will in any way bias his view , " said Kate Kendell , head of the National Center for Lesbian Rights , which is supporting the lawsuit to overturn Prop .
8 .
As evidence , she cites the judge 's conservative - albeit libertarian - reputation , and says , " There was n't anyone who thought ( overturning Prop. 8 ) was a cakewalk given his sexual orientation . "
State Sen. Mark Leno , D - San Francisco , who has sponsored two bills to authorize same - sex marriage that were vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , said that as far as he 's concerned , Walker 's background is a nonissue .
" It seems curious to me , " he said , that when the state Supreme Court heard a challenge to Prop. 8 , the justices ' sexual orientation " was never discussed . "
Leno added , " I have great respect for Judge Walker , professionally and personally . "
Walker has declined to talk about anything involving the Prop. 8 case outside court , and he would n't comment to us when we asked about his orientation and whether it was relevant to the lawsuit .
Many San Francisco gays still hold Walker in contempt for a case he took when he was a private attorney , when he represented the U.S. Olympic Committee in a successful bid to keep San Francisco 's Gay Olympics from infringing on its name .
" Life is full of irony , " the judge replied when we reminded him about that episode .
And did he have any concerns about being characterized as gay ?
" No comment . "
Shortly after our conversation , we heard from a federal judge who counts himself as a friend and confidant of Walker's .
He said he had spoken with Walker and was concerned that " people will come to the conclusion that ( Walker ) wants to conceal his sexuality . "
" He has a private life and he does n't conceal it , but does n't think it is relevant to his decisions in any case , and he does n't bring it to bear in any decisions , " said the judge , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the Prop. 8 trial .
" Is it newsworthy ? " he said of Walker 's orientation , and laughed .
" Yes . "
He said it was hard to ignore the irony that " in the beginning , when ( Walker ) sought to be a judge , a major obstacle he had to overcome was the perception that he was anti-gay . "
In short , the friend said , Walker 's background is relevant in the same way people would want to know that a judge hearing a discrimination case involving Latinos was Latino or a Jewish judge was ruling in a case involving the Anti-Defamation League .
Walker , by the way , did n't seek out the Prop. 8 case - it was assigned to him at random .
If the judge decides that Prop. 8 is unconstitutional , supporters of the measure are sure to take it to the federal appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court , if necessary .
Kendell expects that if that happens , the measure 's proponents will make an issue of the judge 's sexual orientation - at least in the public arena .
Not so , said Andy Pugno , general counsel for the group that sponsored the Prop. 8 campaign .
" We are not going to say anything about that , " Pugno said .
He was quick to assert , however , that Prop. 8 backers have n't gotten a fair shake from Walker in court .
He cited both the judge 's order for the campaign to turn over thousands of pages of internal memos to the other side and Walker 's decision to allow the trial to be broadcast - both of which were overturned by higher courts .
" In many ways , the sponsors of Prop. 8 have been put at significant disadvantage throughout the case , " Pugno said .
" Regardless of the reason for it . "

North Koreans who recently fled to China say many of their fellow citizens are losing faith in the regime of Kim Jong
Il after a disastrous currency revaluation that wiped out savings and left food scarcer than at any time since the famine of the mid-1990s , when as many as 2 million people died .
“ People are outspoken .
They complain , ” said a 56 - year - old woman from the border city of Musan who gave her name as Li Mi Hee .
Lowering her voice to a whisper , she said , “ My son thinks that something might happen .
I do n’t know what , but I can tell you this : People have opinions .
. . .
It is not like the 1990s when people just died without saying what they thought . ”
Li was one of several North Korean women from different parts of the country interviewed this month near the border with China .
Using pseudonyms , as many North Koreans do even outside their country to protect family members from retaliation , they told of panic in the wake of the bungled economic move , which left even a staple such as rice in the hands of black marketeers and sent the communist government scrambling to repair the damage .
“ The whole economic structure has collapsed because of the currency reform , ” said James Kim , a Korean American educator and president of the Yanbian University of Science and Technology in Yanji , China , who is in the process of setting up a similar school in Pyongyang , the North Korean capital .
“ It is a very difficult situation for them .
. . .
It might end up being worse than the 1990s . ”
The economic disarray comes at a delicate time for North Korea as the 68 - year - old Kim Jong
Il , reportedly suffering the effects of a stroke , tries to hand the reins of power to his youngest son , Kim Jong Un , a little - known figure who is in his 20s .
In the last few months , officials of the ruling Korean Workers ’
Party have been quietly told that the younger Kim is the designated successor ; many expect his photograph soon to be hung next to the mandatory portraits of Kim Jong Il and his father , Kim Il Sung .
“ If his father is doing such a bad job , what can we expect of his son ? ” Li said .
Trying to deflect public anger , the government reportedly executed the senior bureaucrat who was the architect of the currency revaluation .
South Korea ’s Yonhap news service reported last week that Pak Nam Ki , 77 , chief of planning and finance for the Korean Workers ’
Party , had been shot by a firing squad in Pyongyang after being charged with “ deliberately ruining the national economy . ”
Party officials have also issued rare public apologies over the mishandling of the currency , North Koreans say .
“ They apologized , but it did n’t do us any good .
People already had lost all their money , ” said Song Hee , a 17 - year - old from Musan .
She said party officials in Musan went door to door , speaking to neighborhood leaders of the inminban , or “ people ’s committee , ” about the economic mistakes .
The teenager fled last month after the revaluation wiped out the cash her parents had been saving in hopes of sending her to college .
“ My friends would leave too if they could .
They see no future in North Korea , ” Song Hee said nervously , her bangs slick with sweat across her forehead .
Before the revaluation , Song Hee said , her mother had been making a modest living selling cheap socks , keeping the family reasonably well fed .
North Korea announced Nov. 30 that it was issuing new currency and that the old currency would become invalid .
People were permitted to trade in their old money for new , but only the equivalent of about $ 30 on the black market .
( The limit was later raised . )
Unlike in Pyongyang , where people had seven days ’ notice , the currency changeover in Musan took place within 48 hours , Song Hee said .
“ People were in shock .
Our money was becoming like water .
With the psychological stress , many people had to go to the hospital , ” she said .
As far as she knew , nobody dared to disobey the order for fear of punishment .
“ We were told that somebody decided he would burn the money instead of giving it to the government .
The money had the picture of Kim Il Sung , and because he burned it he was shot to death for treason , ” Song Hee said .
The idea behind the currency exchange , economists say , was to confiscate the cash of people who had become relatively rich selling on the private market and to restore the equality espoused by the communist system .
“ They wanted to make everybody the same , ” said Choi Kum Ok , a 54 - year - old member of the Korean Workers ’ Party who left North Korea ’s Yanggang province in mid-December to work in China .
Choi , who said she remains loyal to the regime , nonetheless acknowledged that the economic overhaul had backfired .
“ There is no food , and what there is has become unaffordable , ” Choi said .
Immediately after the currency revaluation was announced , police shut down the markets where people had been buying most of their food .
In theory , people were supposed to buy it from state stores at subsidized prices .
But the state stores had no food and people were forced to scrounge for whatever they could purchase at exorbitant prices from black marketeers .
By the end of December , North Korean authorities had retracted the ban on markets .
But the merchants had lost all their cash and could n’t restock their merchandise .
Meanwhile , the Chinese traders who had previously supplied markets did n’t want to come into the country because of bans imposed on the use of foreign currency and the wildly fluctuating exchange rates .
Food remains in such short supply that a single egg costs a full week ’s salary for many .
Rice remains largely unavailable at state stores and can be purchased only illegally at about the equivalent of more than two weeks ’ salary .
One North Korean woman interviewed said common laborers under the new system were making about 2,500 won per month , barely more than $ 1 at the new exchange rates prevailing on the black market .
Cooking oil is a luxury , so unaffordable that people buy only a few grams at a time in small plastic bags .
Markets are said to have less than one - third of the merchandise they stocked before the reform .
The economic misstep comes on the heels of a disappointing 2009 harvest and before one this year that is also shaping up to be lean because of declining donations of fertilizer and seeds from South Korea .
The scarcity is spreading to the more privileged in North Korea .
An aid worker who visits regularly said that this month , officials begged him to bring in food the next time .
“ I usually bring a bottle of Scotch as a gift -- they really enjoy it -- but this time they said , ‘ Why did n’t you bring in rice instead ? ’ ” said the aid worker , who asked not to be identified .
Even the relatively privileged capital has been affected .
“ We live in one of the richer parts of the country .
Things were OK for us around 2004 , but now they ’ve gotten bad again , maybe worse than before .
. . .
People are starving to death , ” said Su Jong , 28 , who is from Pyongsong .
The city , on the northern outskirts of Pyongyang , is home to many of North Korea ’s top science institutes and to the largest wholesale market .
Although Su Jong held North Korea ’s economic policies at fault , she said she had not lost her love for Kim Jong Il .
“ If [ Kim ] was a good leader , we would n’t see children starving , people wandering the streets in rags , the markets with no food , ” she said .
“ But I do n’t doubt his good intentions .
It is the people under him who are corrupt . ”
It was a common sentiment among the North Koreans interviewed in China , several of whom said they were n’t defectors and hoped to return to their country .
North Koreans live under a cult of personality in which members of the Kim family are demigods with unsurpassed skills at everything from golf to metallurgy and , of course , economic management .
During the 1990s famine , North Koreans were largely persuaded by propagandists that U.S. sanctions were to blame for their troubles .
“ In China , people use bad words to criticize the government , ” said Jeong Hee Ok , 50 , who left the east coast city of Hamhung in mid-December to work as a maid in China .
“ But I come from North Korea ; even little children know you are a bad person if you talk that way about the leadership .
It is hard to change that mind - set . ”

You had to know someone out there would try and profit off Microsoft 's recent mass bannination of modded Xbox 360 consoles from Xbox Live , and although the eBay scammers arguably got there first , we 're awarding the style trophy to AbingtonIP , an Oklahoma law firm that 's trying to gin up a class - action lawsuit .
Why ?
Because even though the XBL terms of service expressly prohibit modded consoles , AbingtonIP thinks it 's not fair for Microsoft to have timed the ban to coincide with the release , and it also thinks it 's unfair for an XBL ban to affect " Xbox functionality not associated with piracy " like Netflix , arcade games , and DLC .
A noble cause , to be sure , but if you 're a modder who did n't think there was a chance you'd be booted from Live at some point , you 're not a very smart modder -- and Microsoft is n't under any obligation to time its bans for the convenience of people breaking its terms of service .
The firm is just at the generating - interest phase and has n't filed anything yet , so we 'll see how far these freedom fighters get -- we 'd guess this one dies on the vine .

Nintendo Japan has announced that they will present the newest portable console , the Nintendo 3DS , in June .
The new handheld will offer 3D viewing without glasses .
Here 's all the information we have gathered so far :

• With the announcement slated for E3 in June , Nintendo 's shooting a bit early in their Japanese press release by saying it will go on sale sometime between April 2010 - March 2011 .
• You wo n't need to wear 3D glasses to enjoy the 3D effects .
This may work like Rittai Kakushi e Attakoreda , the Nintendo DSi game that uses the frontal camera to track the viewer eyes .
By tracking the user 's eyes — a trick first shown by Johnny Chung Lee 's Wii hack — the machine can alter the perspective in the game to make it look as if the player is looking into a 3D virtual space .

• It 's unclear if this would be the only 3D element in the console .
• Backwards compatibility will be incorporated for DS and DSi games support .
• It may have an accelerometer for tilt - controls with motion - led gaming , just like the iPhone / iPod Touch .

• The screen might be higher - res than anything we 've seen from Nintendo before , maybe reaching 720 p — and measuring around the same size as the DS .
Advertisement
• It 'll have two screens just like previous portables , but they 'll be used in conjunction as one giant screen , according to RPAD.tv , who convinced developers to talk to them at GDC .
Advertisement
• A Tegra chip could be powering it .
• Nintendo might put a 3G sim in , for over - the - air downloads .
• Those over - the - air downloads might include ebooks , something already seen on the DSi XL .

UPDATE
• It 'll include two cameras ( one backwards - facing , one forward - facing ) , just like the DSi — for DSi backwards compatibility support .
Advertisement
• The Japanese publication Asahi is claiming it 'll use one of Sharp 's parallax barrier LCDs .
• 3D control sticks may help with gaming , if Nikkei 's report is correct , and the 3DS itself could vibrate like an old Rumble Pak .

What ’s more , despite advances , the pipeline of new drugs has slowed to a crawl , as one promising candidate after another has petered out in the last phases of development .
" The low - hanging fruit has been picked , " says Derek Lowe , PhD , a drug discovery chemist and industry pundit .
William Haseltine , PhD , a former researcher at Harvard Medical School and the founder of Human Genome Sciences and eight other biotechnology companies , notes that fewer than 1 in 100 new ideas reaches clinical trials and fewer than 10 percent of these are approved for sale .
This high failure rate means that the few drugs that do get through the gauntlet of clinical trials and FDA approval become must - win propositions .
A company must pull out all the stops to sell the drug , which means marketing .
The drug industry ’s intense marketing to physicians has been well covered .
But it ’s worth noting here that some marketing is designed to push out perfectly worthwhile older treatments ( whose patent protection has often expired and can therefore be sold as cheap generics ) in order to advance newer treatments ( which are under patent protection , and therefore are more expensive ) .
But are the new drugs really better ?
The FDA does n’t require comparative clinical trials , only proof that the drug beats a placebo .
So unless somebody were to compare drugs head to head , it ’s almost impossible to say .
That was the premise behind a landmark study by the name of ALLHAT ( short for Antihypertensive and Lipid- Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial ) , begun in 1994 .
Various treatments for high blood pressure were compared side by side in order to see , once and for all , which treatment was really best .
At the time the study began , the use of diuretics and beta - blockers was in decline , while three newer treatments — calcium channel blockers , angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors ( known as ACE inhibitors ) , and alpha - adrenergic blockers — were on the rise .
But since these newer drugs had only been compared to placebo when working their way to FDA approval , there was no way to know which treatment was most effective .
The study , which recruited 42,000 individuals with elevated blood pressure , was one of the most ambitious ever carried out for the condition .
The subjects were divided into four groups and given one of four treatments : a diuretic , an ACE inhibitor , a calcium channel blocker , or an alpha blocker .
Within a few years , the alpha blocker arm of the trial was stopped : Patients were showing a 25 percent increased risk of heart disease .
The other 30,000 patients continued their protocols for 5 years , and then the results were analyzed .
Published in 2002 and elaborated upon in 2006 , the results were a disaster for the drug industry .
Not only was the alpha blocker deemed too suspect to use , but the calcium antagonist and the ACE inhibitor both fell short of the cheap , common , and old - fashioned diuretic in lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of heart disease .
Patients on the newer , patented drugs had higher rates of stroke and heart failure .
Take a look at my bookshelf .
Judging from the available space , any books purchased after 2013 will need to be stored in the fridge .
You can see why an electronic book reader might appeal .
I 'm a serious book lover so have had some resistance to the idea of an e-reader .
But I bought an Amazon Kindle late last year and have now been using it - alongside regular books - for about three months .
I know the world needs another Kindle review like it needs another Britney Spears crotch shot , but I feel obliged because I promised on twitter that I 'd share my thoughts after I 'd given the Kindle a decent workout .
Here 's the short version : I love it , it 's far cheaper than buying actual books but the range is too limited in Australia .
In a tip - o - the - hat to Choose Your Own Adventure , I 'm giving readers two options here :
If you could n't give two hoots about my thoughts on the Kindle , skip to the end of the article for your 10 interesting things to read , watch or listen to .
Or if too much Kindle critique is barely enough , read on ...
THE PROS : It 's very straightforward to use .
You can alter the font size and style if you wish and the screen is very easy on the eyes .
I did n't find it any harder to read than a regular book .
It is extremely convenient for travel - you can read a dozen books on holidays without weighing down your suitcase .
One of the best features allows you to download a sample of a book to try before you buy .
Once you fork out the $ 300 or so for the device , the cost savings are extraordinary , particularly if you buy a lot of books .
The first book I downloaded was Nick Hornby 's Juliet , Naked for $ 11.99 .
I checked at my local bookstore last week and it was $ 32.95 .
Here 's a price comparison on some other well known titles ( all in Australian dollars ) :
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ' by Stieg Larsson - $ 7.50 vs $ 24.95 in store .
Eat , Pray , Love by Elizabeth Gilbert - $ 10.98 vs $ 24.95 .
Stripping Bare the Body by Mark Danner - $ 17.92 vs $ 39.95 .
No Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy - $ 11.99 vs $ 22.95 .
THE CONS : As a book lover , I 'd be lying if I did n't say that I missed the feel of a regular book .
And browsing electronically is not as good as browsing in a bookstore .
The Kindle is great if you know what you want ( and it 's available ) .
For me , by far the biggest drawback is the lack of range in Australia compared to the US .
This is because electronic rights are still being negotiated in the Australian market .
In my line of work , two books have attracted enormous attention in recent months : Going Rogue by Sarah Palin and Race of a Lifetime by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann .
Neither is on the Kindle here .
The available fiction range in Australia seems fairly populist .
If you 're after Stephanie Meyer , Stieg Larsson , Barbara Kingsolver or JK Rowling , you 'll be fine .
If you 're chasing Philip Roth , Ian McEwan , Jonathan Franzen or Alice Munro , you 'll be frustrated .
And forget about Helen Garner , JM Coetzee or Tim Winton .
I put this issue via email to Simon Fitzgerald , who is Amazon 's spokesman in Australia , and he replied :
" It really depends on the publisher and the rights they 've negotiated with the author to sell the books .
Amazon has books available in Australia that are n't available to US customers and vice versa .
There are now 323,756 books available to Australian customers , at the time of launch this number was around 280,000 , so in effect thousands of books are being added on a weekly basis . "
As for the Kindle 's most significant con : read it in the bath at your own risk .
Today 's gems :
1. Charlie Brooker disagrees that the generic experience of the Kindle versus a book is one of its drawbacks - at least nobody can judge you for reading a pot boiler .
2 . I 've thought long and hard about linking to this article because it is possibly the most gut - churning , heart - wrenching thing I 've ever read and it was so difficult to get through that I do n't know if I want to recommend the experience to others .
It 's not gory or graphic but it is deeply emotionally stressful .
I decided eventually to include it because it 's such a phenomenal piece of journalism .
The article is called Fatal Distraction and the sub - heading is Forgetting a child in the back seat of a hot , parked car is a horrifying , inexcusable mistake .
But is it a crime ?
3 . Until I read the article above , I only knew Gene Weingarten as a humour writer ( he writes a column for The Washington Post called Below the Beltway ) .
But he 's far more versatile than that .
Check out his article on what happens when one of the greatest musicians in the world busks at a railway station .
4 . I think Leonard Nimoy is going for an Australian accent here , but who can tell ?
( via @scrivenersfancy ) 5 . Will Rupert Murdoch be able to slay The New York Times with his overhaul of The Wall Street Journal ?
A New York magazine profile of Rupert Murdoch looks at this issue along with his battles with Google and his possible succession to his son , James Murdoch .
6 . The famous author Jonathan Safran Foer was caught in a classroom explosion at summer camp when he was a child .
" I can't think of anything I 'm more ashamed of than having asked Stewart to describe my face to me , or anything I am more grateful for than our having been together for those minutes . "
7 . Knut the polar bear used to be so k- not .
8 . Recently the Australian Literary Review published a survey in which Australian politicians nominated their favourite books .
It prompted the author John Birmingham to ponder which books we really read as to those we pretend to read when asked .
9 . If you watch Scrubs , you 'll know the terrifically manic performance of actor John C. McGinley .
He recently wrote an article about his 12 - year - old son with Down 's syndrome and why he objects to the word ' retard ' .

Flight 253 : Intelligence Agencies Nixed State Department Move to Revoke Bomber ’s Visa
by Tom Burghardt / February 8th , 2010
Rightist demagogues , as they are wont to do , prattle - on how they , and they alone , can “ keep America safe ” –by shredding the Constitution .
Waging a decades - long psychological war against the American people , corporatist thugs embedded within the National Security State assure us that secrecy , deceit and imperial adventures that steal other peoples ’ resources are the one true path to national prosperity and universal happiness .
But what happens when those charged with protecting us from attack , actually aid and abet those who would kill us , and then handsomely profit from our slaughter in the process ?
During a January 27 hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security , Under Secretary of State for Management , Patrick F. Kennedy , testified that the visa of accused bomber , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , was n’t revoked at the specific request of secret state agencies .
Kennedy , a Bushist State Department holdover , was the former Director on National Intelligence for Management and headed the transition team that set up the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in 2005 under former Ambassador to Iraq , John D. Negroponte , a veteran of U.S. covert operations since the Vietnam war .
Given the avalanche of media interest , fueled by Fox News and the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal , whether or not the suspect should have been read his Miranda rights , the only coverage of the hearings that reported Kennedy ’s explosive testimony , was a brief article in the Detroit News .
Claiming that “ revocation action would ’ve disclosed what they were doing , ” Kennedy said that allowing the alleged terrorist to keep his visa would have “ helped ” federal investigators take down the entire network “ rather than simply knocking out one solider in that effort . ”
A “ soldier ” ( indicted criminal ) who would have murdered 300 air passengers if the detonator concealed in his underpants had n’t serendipitously failed to explode the device .
As Alex Lantier wrote February 3 on the World Socialist Web Site , the latest in a series of significant revelations “ has been buried by the media . ”
The socialist critic avers : “ As of this writing , nearly a week after the hearing , the New York Times , Wall Street Journal , Washington Post and Los Angeles Times have published no articles on the subject .
Nor have the broadcast or cable media reported on it . ”
Lantier charges that “ despite–or perhaps more accurately , because of –the fact that this information exposes the official government story of the near - disaster to be a lie ” the corporate media is fully complicit in the cover-up .
Weeks after the incident , it is now clear that intelligence agencies did far more than simply “ watch ” a potential terrorist .
That they gave Abdulmutallab a leg up , bypassing airline security systems put in place after 9/11 that would have prevented him from boarding that plane , is also crystal clear .
The question is : was a reckless calculation made that gambled the lives of 300 air passengers for ruthless political purposes ?
If so , was it designed to destabilize the Obama government , thereby binding it ever - closer to a permanent , unelected , security apparatus that feathers its nest by serving the only constituency that matters–giant energy firms , defense - related corporations and those who finance them ?
Is this scenario being played out in Washington where Republican right - wingers like Senators Susan Collins ( ME ) , Tom Coburn ( OK ) , John McCain ( AZ ) , John Ensign ( NV ) and Lindsey Graham ( SC ) , but also neocon Democrats such as Joseph Lieberman ( ID - CT ) , demand that the accused be turned over to the military for “ special handling , ” thereby ratcheting - up pressure for increased domestic repression ?
Just as pertinently , is this what White House insider Richard Wolffe meant when he said on MSNBC ’s Countdown with Keith Olbermann January 4 that the “ president is leaning very much towards thinking this was a systemic failure by individuals who maybe had an alternative agenda . ” ( emphasis added )
For weeks now , the Obama administration and the media have played the same broken record : despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , a multitude of security agencies , ranging from the CIA , the FBI , the National Counterterrorism Center ( NCTC ) , a satrapy of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) , the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security , “ failed to connect the dots . ”
But as I have documented in previous reports , most recently on January 22 , citing multiple domestic and foreign intelligence warnings , including a walk - in interview at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja , Nigeria ’s capital , by the suspect ’s own father , a former top official in the Nigerian government , consular officials and CIA officers passed the warning up the food chain –where it sat .
Abdulmutallab on the CIA and NCTC’s Radar
The revelation that various agencies of America ’s shadow government made a deliberate decision that allowed Abdulmutallab to board Flight 253 is more extensive than previously disclosed .
Newsweek revealed February 2 that “ a single intelligence community database operated by the CIA , known by the code name ‘ Hercules ’ , ” held all the “ ‘ bits and pieces ’ of intelligence that White House officials believe could have led U.S. authorities to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab before last December 25 . ”
However , even though the agencies had assembled information on the suspect in a single computer system where it was readily accessible to analysts , anonymous “ intelligence officials ” told journalist Mark Hosenball that “ all source ” analysts at CIA and NCTC “ which both had access to ‘ Hercules , ’ were unable to assemble the intelligence scraps in time to prevent Abdulmutallab from boarding his Christmas Day flight from Amsterdam to Detroit with a bomb hidden in his underpants . ”
The unnamed officials told Hosenball that the failure to stop the suspect “ validates assertions by White House and congressional investigators that the alleged lapses in the handling of intelligence related to Abdulmutallab did not stem from a failure of sometimes turf - conscious spy agencies to share information with each other . ”
“ Instead , ” Newsweek reports , “ they point to the intelligence analysis carried out by the CIA and NCTC . ”
As I previously reported , citing a January 18 investigation by The New York Times , the National Security Agency “ learned from a communications intercept ” that a man named “ ‘ Umar Farouk ’ – the first two names of the jetliner suspect , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab–had volunteered for a coming operation . ”
Additional NSA intercepts in December “ mentioned the date of Dec. 25 , and suggested that they were ‘ looking for ways to get somebody out ’ or ‘ for ways to move people to the West , ’ one senior administration official said . ”
Running for cover , an intelligence official told Newsweek : “ The volume of any database does n’t matter much .
That , by itself , does n’t get you anywhere . ”
An interesting spin , when one considers the multibillion dollar expansion by NSA , as investigative journalist James Bamford reported last November .
The official continues , “ Nor does the mere fact that the NCTC and the CIA have shared access to material .
The key is knowing what to look for , how to bring together different bits and scraps of information that –on the surface and in an ocean of data– do n’t appear to be connected . ”
Conversely , knowing which “ bits and scraps ” to ignore from a parapolitical perspective , may have played an equally critical role in a presumed analytical “ lapse . ”
“ This is hard stuff , ” the anonymous source pontificates .
“ It ’s not a case of punching in a couple of search terms , sitting back , and waiting for enlightenment .
Once you know the answer , it seems easy .
But in real life , you do n’t get the answer ahead of time . ”
Really ?
To the contrary , as with the September 11 , 2001 hijack team , the Flight 253 affair seems to indicate that the decision to allow Abdulmutallab to board the plane was a political , not a law enforcement decision that led analysts not to “ connect ” more than a few of the “ dots . ”
As we now know , prior to 9/11 , the Pentagon ’s Able Danger unit had amassed terabytes of data on al - Qaeda sleeper cells in the United States .
According to published reports , the unit had obtained detailed information on ringleader , the drug - addled Mohammed Atta , and other members of the suicide squad .
Yet just scant months before the atrocity , the unit was shuttered and the data destroyed .
Corporate media and the 9/11 Commission have advanced two contradictory propositions on Able Danger ’s demise : the Pentagon unit had n’t gathered intelligence on Atta and claims to contrary were overblown or they illegally obtained information on ordinary Americans and were shut down for inadvertent spying .
However as researcher Paul Thompson revealed in The Terror Timeline , Able Danger had identified Americans , only they were the wrong Americans .
According to Thompson , the unit pegged “ future National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , former Defense Secretary William Perry , and other prominent Americans as potential security risks ” over their illicit dealings with foreign governments .
How ’s that for an inconvenient truth !
As with earlier warnings of impending terrorist strikes , political efficacy trumped the safety and security of the American people .
This is underscored by January 20 testimony by NCTC Director , Bushist embed Michael E. Leiter , before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
CongressDaily revealed that Leiter told the senators , “ I will tell you , that when people come to the country and they are on the watch list , it is because we have generally made the choice that we want them here in the country for some reason or another . ”
Journalist Chris Strohm disclosed that intelligence officials “ acknowledged the government knowingly allows foreigners whose names are on terrorist watch lists to enter the country in order to track their movement and activities , ” a fact now confirmed by Patrick F. Kennedy ’s January 27 testimony before the House Committee .
Similar to the Detroit News report on Kennedy ’s admission , to date , not a single media outlet picked - up the trail and investigated CongressDaily ’s chilling disclosure .
Burying the Evidence , “ Moving On ”
Corporate media are chock - a- block with reports of efforts by right - wing Republicans and some Democrats to brand the Obama administration as “ soft on terrorism . ”
As readers are well aware , Antifascist Calling does n’t carry water for the Obama administration ; a government that has rightly been characterized as a slick makeover of the previous regime .
However it must be acknowledged , unlike Bushist torture freaks , in Abdulmutallab ’s case constitutional norms were followed and a criminal suspect lawfully charged for an egregious act .
In “ new normal ” America however , not disappearing a suspect into a gulag , subject to tender ministrations by “ enhanced interrogation ” specialists ( torturers ) is viewed as a bad thing in our debased political culture .
Meanwhile media stenographers scrupulously ignore , with a single - mindedness one has come to expect from totalitarian regimes , considerable evidence that elements of the intelligence - security apparatus could be charged as accessories before and after the fact with Abdulmutallab ’s alleged offense .
In his prepared statement to the House Committee , Kennedy asserted that “ following his father ’s November 19 visit to the Embassy , we sent a cable to the Washington intelligence and law enforcement community through proper channels ( the Visas Viper system ) that ‘ Information at post suggests [ that Farouk ] may be involved in Yemeni - based extremists . ’
At the same time , the Consular Section entered Abdulmutallab into the Consular Lookout and Support System database known as CLASS . ”
When it was discovered that officials in Abuja had misspelled the suspect ’s name “ information about previous visas issued to him and the fact that he currently held a valid U.S. visa was not included in the cable . ”
Despite the misspelling however , “ the CLASS entry resulted in a lookout using the correct spelling that was shared automatically with the primary lookout system used by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and accessible to other agencies . ”
In other words , even though the initial Embassy cable misspelled Abdulmutallab ’s name , the “ lookout ” notification sent out to intelligence agencies , specifically DHS , should have warranted further action .
And it also appears that initially it did .
As both the Los Angeles Times and CongressDaily reported , Customs and Border Protection agents obtained the suspect ’s name from the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment or TIDE database , maintained by the NCTC and planned to question Abdulmutallab when Flight 253 landed in Detroit on arrival from Amsterdam .
However , as CongressDaily subsequently revealed , CBP agents “ had information about alleged terrorist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab three days before his departure ” and not during the flight as the Los Angeles Times report initially suggested .
As we now know , information fed to NCTC ’s database contained specific warnings from the State Department–as did the CIA ’s “ Hercules ” system as Newsweek reported , and “ that White House officials believe could have led U.S. authorities to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab before last December 25 , ” according to the newsmagazine ’s anonymous sources .
Why did the State Department fail to revoke the accused terrorist ’s visa ?
When questioned by Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson ( D - MS ) , Kennedy told the panel , “ We will revoke the visa of any individual who is a threat to the United States , but we do take one preliminary step . ”
Kennedy explained , “ We ask our law enforcement and intelligence community partners , ‘ Do you have eyes on this person and do you want us to let this person proceed under your surveillance so that you may potentially break a larger plot ? ’ ”
The Undersecretary added : “ And one of the members [ of the intelligence community ] –and we ’d be glad to give you that [ information ] … in private [ closed session ] –said , ‘ Please , do not revoke this visa .
We have eyes on this person .
We are following this person who has the visa for the purpose of trying to roll up an entire network , not just stop one person . ’ ”
In other words , despite multiple sourced reports from American and overseas security agencies that Al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) was planning to launch an attack , probably on Christmas Day , deploying an asset identified by NSA intercepts as a “ Nigerian ” named “ Umar Farouk , ” high - level intelligence officials , claiming to have “ eyes ” on the alleged AQAP operative , a suspected suicide bomber to boot , allowed him to board an airliner packed with nearly 300 passengers and crew .
In a prepared statement to the Committee , NCTC Director Leiter said , “ Let ’s start with this clear assertion : Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab should not have stepped on that plane .
The counterterrorism system failed and we told the President we are determined to do better . ”
However , neither House Committee members , nor the corporate media which suppressed the story entirely , challenged Leiter ’s statement of a week earlier when he testified before a Senate panel that intelligence agencies allow watch listed terrorists to enter the country “ because we have generally made the choice that we want them here in the country for some reason or another . ”
If Leiter ’s testimony was taken under oath , he should be brought up on charges of perjury since he next asserted that “ Intelligence Community analysts who were working hard on immediate threats to Americans in Yemen did not understand the fragments of intelligence on what turned out later to be Mr. Abdulmutallab , so they did not push him onto the terrorist watchlist . ”
This claim , as with practically all the “ facts ” released to the American people by the White House , Congress or by the secret state agencies themselves , is a rank mendacity .
As Newsweek ’s unnamed sources claim , CIA and NCTC analysts did have access to an “ intelligence community database , ” “ Hercules , ” and that it held all the available data on Abdulmutallab and “ validates assertions by the White House and congressional investigators ” that the failure to stop the bomber were not due to bungled efforts “ to connect the dots . ”
As I reported last month , during a December 22 meeting at the White House , President Obama was briefed by top officials from the CIA , FBI , and Department of Homeland Security “ who ticked off a list of possible plots against the United States and how their agencies were working to disrupt them , ” as The New York Times disclosed January 18 .
Last month , Newsweek reported that “ intelligence analysts had ‘ highlighted ’ an evolving ’ strategic threat ’ , ” and that “ ’ some of the improvised explosive device tactics AQAP might use against U.S. interests were highlighted ’ in other ‘ finished intelligence products ’ . ”
“ Finished intelligence products ” on an evolving plot to destroy an airliner are hardly “ fragments , ” as Leiter deceitfully testified to the House Committee .
Cheekily , NCTC ’s head honcho falsely claimed that his agency , the recipient of billions of dollars in taxpayer largesse , “ did not correlate the specific information that would have been required to help keep Abdulmutallab off that Northwest Airlines flight . ”
Citing the need to “ improve ” intelligence capabilities by accelerating “ information technology enhancements , to include knowledge discovery , database integration , cross - database searches , and the ability to correlate biographic information with terrorism - related intelligence , ” Leiter implies that billions more in handouts to security contractors are needed to “ solve ” the problem .
This from the Director of an agency that under his watch wasted more than $ 500 million on its flawed Railhead project to “ upgrade ” the TIDE database , an initiative “ crippled by technical failures and contractor mismanagement , ” as the Project on Government Oversight ( POGO ) and congressional investigators revealed back in 2008 .
Contractor hanky - panky aside , the problem is not one of technical “ upgrades ” to an agency that seems more concerned with facilitating the entrance of terrorists into the country “ for some reason or another ” than stopping them .
Rather , it is imperative that the American people demand that Congress and the Executive Branch , which in theory , controls the gaggle of alphabet - soup satrapies in cahoots with the most rotten and predatory sectors of the U.S. ruling class , clean house and bring to book , the rightist elements aligned with the petroleum - intelligence nexus who continue to deploy terror gangs such as al - Qaeda as strategic assets .
That they do so regardless of the cost , to the American people and to the victims of illegal U.S. wars and occupations , is a sign that the system , verging on bankruptcy will soon veer even further out of any effective democratic control .
How else can one interpret Director of National Intelligence , Dennis C. Blair ’s chilling assertion to the Senate Committee on Intelligence that he was “ highly certain ” that al - Qaeda “ or one of its affiliates ” will attempt a large - scale attack on American soil within the next six months , ” as The New York Times reported .
“ We judge that al Qaeda maintains its intent to attack the homeland , preferably with a large - scale operation that would cause mass casualties , harm the U.S. economy or both , ” Blair wrote in his annual threat assessment to the Senate Intelligence Committee .
As investigative journalist Russ Baker wrote in his essential book , Family of Secrets , “ Authoritarianism thrives in a climate of fear , and the [ Bush ] administration invoked fear continually .
But when it came to security , there was the usual exemption for large corporate entities [ and ] the tattoo of terror was relentless , especially during the political high season . ”
Not much has changed since Barack Obama became president .
Many of the same dodgy players who ramped - up production lines at the fear factory for the Bush / Cheney team are still in place , doing what they do best : hitting the corporate “ sweet spot ” for their clients in the Military - Industrial - Security - Complex .
In the weeks since the attempted destruction of Flight 253 , one thing is certain : the White House , Congress , the intelligence agencies and their handmaidens , the corporate media , are participating in a massive cover-up .
And as we enter the “ political high season , ” what might come next is anyone ’s guess .

Rare and intimate photographs taken of the leaders of the Cuban revolution during its early years have sold for £ 31,730 at auction in Gloucestershire .
The 14 black - and - white photos include images of President Fidel Castro and fellow communist leader Che Guevara .
Dating from 1959 to the early 1960s , 12 were taken by Mr Castro 's official photographer Alberto Korda .
The prize lot , a picture of Mr Guevara game fishing , fetched £ 6,600 at Dominic Winter Auctioneers , in Cirencester .
The collection sold for nearly £ 26,000 more than was estimated , a spokesman for the auctioneers said .
A picture of Fidel Castro playing golf fetched £ 3,400
The photo of Mr Guevara fishing was bought by a UK - based private collector who spent almost £ 18,000 in total - including £ 3,400 on a picture of Mr Castro playing golf .
A photograph of three tanks passing a huge poster of Mr Guevara sold for 20 times more than its predicted price .
The auction house said it was " inundated " with phone line requests from collectors all over Europe during the auction on Thursday .

LA UNIÓN , Mexico — Gunmen believed to be linked to drug traffickers shot a pregnant American consulate worker and her husband to death in the violence - racked border town of Ciudad Juárez over the weekend , leaving their baby wailing in the back seat of their car , the authorities said Sunday .
The gunmen also killed the husband of another consular employee and wounded his two young children .
The shootings took place minutes apart and appeared to be the first deadly attacks on American officials and their families by Mexico ’s powerful drug organizations , provoking an angry reaction from the White House .
They came during a particularly bloody weekend when nearly 50 people were killed nationwide in drug - gang violence , including attacks in Acapulco as American college students began arriving for spring break .
The killings followed threats against American diplomats along the Mexican border and complaints from consulate workers that drug - related violence was growing untenable , American officials said .
Even before the shootings , the State Department had quietly made the decision to allow consulate workers to evacuate their families across the border to the United States .
In Washington , President Obama denounced the “ brutal murders ” and vowed to “ work tirelessly ” with Mexican law enforcement officials to prosecute the killers .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the killings underscored the need to work with the Mexican government “ to cripple the influence of trafficking organizations at work in Mexico . ”
Despite being a W3C specification since 2001 , Scalable Vector Graphics have never received the attention they deserve .
Primarily , this is because the majority of web users ( using Internet Explorer ) are unable to view the images without a plugin .
SVG is an XML - based file format which describes graphic vectors such as lines , paths , boxes , circles , polygons , and text with color , gradients , patterns , opacity etc .
Bitmaps can also be embedded within an SVG when necessary .
There are a number of reasons why SVG is ideally suited to the web platform :
1. W3C Standards
SVG is an open standard and developers may use it without restrictions .
2. Image scaling
SVGs can be scaled to any size without incurring pixelation or loss of detail .
3. Smaller file size
Simple images such as logos and charts will generally have a smaller file size than their bitmapped JPG , PNG or GIF equivalent .
4. SVG tools are already available
SVG XML code can be created , verified , manipulated and compressed using a variety of existing tools from Notepad to Inkscape , OpenOffice.org Draw , and Microsoft Visio .
5. Server -side generation
SVG XML can be created and manipulated on the server using PHP , . NET , Python or any other language / framework .
6. Client - side generation
SVG XML can be created and manipulated on the client using JavaScript to create dynamic effects and animation .
Event handlers , such as click or mouseover , can be applied to any SVG element .
7. Compatibility
Although the facilities offered by SVG rendering engines may differ , the format is backward and forward compatible .
SVG engines will render what they can and ignore the rest .
8. Accessibility
SVGs are accessible ; text and drawing elements are machine - readable so screen readers can other devices can parse the images .
9. Search Engine Optimization
SVGs offer improved SEO because Google , Yahoo , Bing , and other search engines can index an image ’s content .
To some extent , canvas has stolen SVG ’s thunder because it can be supported in IE without a plugin using VML and JavaScript .
However , canvas does not allow static rendering ( images must be generated by code ) , and drawn elements are not identifiable in a DOM .
IE is the only mainstream browser which does not support SVG .
If Microsoft implement SVG in IE9 , it offers web developers many exciting opportunities and usage will grow exponentially .
Unfortunately , even if SVG is supported in IE9 , the browser will not be available until late 2010 .
Microsoft are unlikely to implement it within previous versions of the browser , so there would be a considerable delay before IE9 achieves a significant market share .
But let ’s be thankful Microsoft are considering SVG ; we ’ve waited a long time .

Ever since my cook - at - home challenge last month , I have n't been eating out much , which is good -- I 'm eating healthier !
But , I still love restaurants ( do n't we all ? ) and next time I find myself giving a server my order , here 's what I 'm going to do ...
We all know that there 's usually a lot of oil that goes into restaurant cooking ( here 's why , explained by celeb chef Devin Alexander ) , but did you know that you can actually cut the calories of your meal in half -- just by asking ?
I recently chatted with Robin Stotter , director of culinary research and development for the restaurant chain P.F. Chang's .
Robin told me about something that P.F.
Chang 's does for customers who are watching their weight , and it 's pretty cool .
Here 's what you do :
Next time you 're at P.F. Chang 's ( they have 187 restaurants across the country , so there 's bound to be one near you ) , just ask your server to swap out the oil that your meal is cooked in and exchange it with vegetable or chicken stock .
It 's a practice called " stock velveted , " and you 'll save somewhere in the range of 250 - 500 calories by making this healthy choice .
And guess what ?
You might not even miss the fat .
Stock - velveted entrees may be light on fat , but they 're not light on flavor , Robin assures me .
And here 's another healthy eating tip : " Ask for light sauce , " he adds .
" There is natural sugars in food and it's often enough to carry it through . "
( I think this is brilliant -- I mean , we ask for " light syrup " at the cafe , why not ask for light sauce at the restaurant ? )
While this is something unique to P.F.
Chang 's , go ahead and ask for the same special treatment next time you 're out at your favorite restaurant and ordering something where it makes sense to ask ( stir fry dishes , sauteed dishes , etc. ) .
Heck , it does n't hurt to ask !

The Seven Deadly Sins of Linux Security
Avoid these common security risks like the devil
Bob Toxen , Horizon Network Security
The problem with security advice is that there is too much of it and that those responsible for security certainly have too little time to implement all of it .
The challenge is to determine what the biggest risks are and to worry about those first and about others as time permits .
Presented here are the seven common problems - the seven deadly sins of security - most likely to allow major damage to occur to your system or bank account .
If any of these are a problem on any of your systems , you will want to take care of them immediately .
These seven deadly sins are based on my research and experience , which includes too many people who wait until after their Linux or Unix systems have suffered security breaches before they take action to increase system security , and on forensics analysis and discussions with systems administrators .
Most of these sins and their solutions also apply to Macs , Windows , and other platforms .
They are not ordered by risk level because committing any one of them will likely allow your system to be compromised if it is accessible from the Internet .
Even if you are behind a firewall , if you receive any untrusted data from the Internet , such as Web pages , e-mail , or instant messages , your system is at great risk .
Avoid these sins like the devil .
Without further ado , here are the seven deadly sins and what to do about them .
SIN ONE : Weak Passwords
As a systems administrator , you are aware of the system breaches possible on your Linux or Unix machine .
You have taken the time and effort to devise a difficult - to - guess root password that uses at least 12 characters that include at least two words or no words from the dictionary , uses both letters and digits , and has upper - and lowercase letters and some punctuation characters .
I still run into clients with passwords so simple that any hacker could break them in a few minutes with a tweaked version of ssh that guesses different passwords .
Such hacker tools can be found on the Web easily with Google or built by any C or C++ programmer .
On Internet - accessible systems , I have seen root passwords consisting of a word followed by a small number , where that word is related to the company , what it does , who is in it , or where it is .
A good hacker will go to your Web site and see all of this information , then feed it into a password - cracking program .
Another common mistake is to use the same password or very similar passwords for root accounts ( or other important accounts ) on different systems .
Thus , a cracker who breaches one system through a means other than password guessing will then be able to install a Trojaned server for ssh , FTP , or IMAP , or a Trojaned CGI program on that system , see what passwords you use , and try them on the other systems .
I have seen this happen many times .
A variation is to use ssh public keys to allow an account on one system to ssh into another system without supplying any password .
At the very least , pick a moderately hard - to - crack password for your ssh keys .
If you must have an automatic program use ssh without a password to ssh into another system , then create either a separate nonroot account on the target system or an alternate account with UID 0 but a login " shell " that does just what is needed , such as doing a backup .
An even better solution , say for a remote backup , would be for the system needing to be backed up to ssh into the system receiving the backups as a unique unprivileged account for this purpose and copy an encrypted version of the backup .
Thus , if the backup server is compromised , no confidential data will be obtained .
Let 's hope your root password is awesome and that no one could guess it in 100 years .
OK , some obsessive with a program such as Crack could destroy it in a few days except that you use shadow passwords , but that 's another story .
It is critically important to select good passwords .
How are your users doing ?
Choke , cough , gag , hack .
Every account is a possible entry point .
Have your users followed your advice , company policy , or threats to devise good passwords ?
Are they being as careful as you are ?
Probably not .
Now it is your turn to don the black hat and think like your enemy .
Can you break into your users ' accounts by using a password - cracking program ?
You definitely will need to get written management approval to conduct this level of security audit .
There are notable cases of unauthorized audits landing people in jail or at least on the unemployment rolls .
( Randal Schwartz is one .
The software consultant and author was brought to trial for accessing a password file at Intel in what he says was an attempt to show lapses in security . )
You might even install a module in the passwd program that automatically tries to break a user 's proposed new password .
Though the standard passwd program makes very simple tests , there are more sophisticated routines that include much of Crack 's capability .
One way to do this is to make use of the cracklib capability in the PAM ( pluggable authentication modules ) enhancements to the passwd program .
The cracklib library analyzes passwords to determine if they can be easily cracked .
PAM offers additional security for Linux and Unix systems .
Edit the /etc / pam.d / passwd file to include the code in figure 1 .
This will cause the PAM - enabled passwd program to load these dynamically loadable program libraries .
PAM now is standard with Red Hat .
On some systems these are in / lib instead of /usr / lib .
( Another good source for PAM information is http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/pam/.)
On Slackware this capability will be enabled if the following line is present in /etc / login.defs ( and the dictionary is installed ) :
CRACKLIB_DICTPATH
/var / cache/cracklib/cracklib_dict
Consider restricting which remote systems can ssh into your systems ' various accounts either through IP tables firewall rules or by editing your ssh server 's configuration file , / etc / ssh / sshd_config , to limit which remote systems can ssh in and which accounts they can ssh into , or use both methods for additional security .
Make this list very short for root ( in sshd_config ) .
SIN TWO : Open Network Ports
Just as every account on your system is a potential path for a password cracker , every network service is a road to it .
Disable and uninstall services you do not need .
Most Linux distributions and Unix vendors install tons of software and services by default .
They deliberately prefer easy over secure .
Many of these are neither necessary nor wanted .
Take the time to remove software and services you do not need .
Better yet , do not install them to begin with .
To find out which services are being run , use the netstat - atuv command .
Even a home system can have dozens of different ports open .
A large Web server could have more .
If there are services listed that you do not want to be provided by this box , disable them .
Many distributions offer a control panel to do this easily , including Red Hat and Mandriva .
You may want to remove the binaries from the disk or chmod them to 0 , especially any that are set - UID or set - GID .
NFS , finger , the shell , exec , login r* services ( rsh , rexec , and rlogin ) , FTP , telnet , sendmail , DNS , and linuxconf are some of the more popular services that get installed by default on many Linux distributions ; at least some of these should not be enabled for most systems .
Most are controlled by the daemon xinetd ; these can be disabled by editing the /etc / xinetd.d/* scripts .
You do not need the FTP or telnet daemons to use the respective clients to connect to other systems .
You do not need the sendmail daemon listening on port 25 to send mail out , to send mail to local users , or to download mail via POP or IMAP .
( You do need to invoke sendmail periodically to de-spool delayed outgoing mail . )
You need DNS ( named , the name daemon ) only if other systems will be querying yours for this data .
Most programs running on your own system will be very happy to read / etc / resolv.conf and query the main DNS server of your ISP or organization instead of contacting a named process running on your system .
Coincidentally , named 's ports are some of the most popular ports that crackers use to break into systems .
If you do need to run named , use the recently added facilities that allow it to chroot itself and switch to a nonroot user .
All of these services , except the normal installations of NFS,1 DNS , and sendmail , are started on demand by xinetd .
They may be turned off by commenting out their entries under /etc / xinetd.d .
Many distributions offer a control panel or Linuxconf to do this easily , including Red Hat and Mandriva .
The stand - alone services are turned off by altering their entries under / etc / rc.d or in configuration files there .
On Red Hat - based systems , issue the following commands to shut down portmap and prevent it from being restarted on reboot .
/etc/rc.d/init.d/portmap stop
chkconfig -- del portmap
An alternative tool is the ASCII menu - based ntsysv program .
Like chkconfig , ntsysv manipulates the symbolic links only under / etc / rc.d / rc[ 0 - 6 ] .d , so you also will need to explicitly shut down the service .
To do both of these , issue the commands
/etc/rc.d/init.d/portmap stop
ntsysv
On other distributions that use System V - style startup scripts ( / etc / rc.d / rc [ 0 - 6 ] .d directories for Red Hat derivations and / etc / rc. [ 0 - b ] .d for Debian ) , rename the appropriate script under rcX.d ( X usually is 3 ) that starts with a capital S and has the service name in it .
For example ,
cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d mv S11 portmap K11portmap
Just as only scripts starting with S are invoked when entering the respective run level , scripts starting with K are invoked when exiting that run level .
This is to turn off daemons that should run only in that run level .
For example , this mechanism will turn off sshd , the ssh daemon , when switching from run level 3 ( multiuser with networking ) to run level s ( single - user mode ) .
Just as a selected Ssomething script can be disabled by renaming to ssomething , one of these latter scripts can be renamed from Ksomething to ksomething to disable it .
On Slackware and similar systems , simply comment out the lines starting them in /etc/rc.d /*.
The grep program may be used to find these .
Be sure to terminate any of these services that are running on your system after altering the configuration files .
If you do not want to bother with kill , a simple reboot will do this and verify that the configuration files were correctly altered .
( Having a set of available rescue disks before this reboot would be a fine idea . )
To remove these services from your system , you can use your distribution 's package manager .
Red Hat - based installations use RPM ; Debian - based distributions use dpkg ; SuSE uses YAST ; and Slackware uses pkgtool .
Linux and Unix are like the Swiss army knife of networking : they have one or two tools that get used all the time , others that are used less often , and some that are never used .
Unlike the Swiss army knife , you can slim down Linux or Unix to just the services you need and discard those you do not .
I will never use the awl or scissors on my knife just as I will never use rsh or the set - UID to root features of mount or umount .
Decide which ports you wish to have open ( such as www and ftp ) and close the rest .
Closing unnecessary ports makes your system more secure and perform better .
SIN THREE : Old Software Versions
Linux and Unix are not perfect .
People find new vulnerabilities every month .
2
Do not despair , though .
The speed with which problems are found and fixed in Linux is the fastest on the planet .
Your challenge as an administrator is to keep up with the changes .
Each distribution has a mailing list through which security bulletins are issued , and an FTP or Web site where the fix will be available .
There are also excellent independent security mailing lists , such as Bugtraq and X - Force 's Alert .
You can ( and should ) subscribe to these lists .
3
Other good sources of Linux security information are http://www.lwn.net/ and http://www.linuxtoday.com/.
These sites are distribution - neutral and carry all of the major distributions ' security advisories .
One of the advantages of Linux is that when a fix is issued , it is very quick to install .
Furthermore , unless it is in the kernel , your downtime for that service is on the order of seconds or minutes .
Rarely , if ever , is a reboot necessary .
SIN FOUR : Insecure and Badly Configured Programs
The use of insecure programs ( such as PHP , FTP , rsh , NFS , and portmap ) in other than carefully controlled situations and failure to configure other programs properly continues to be a major security sin .
Most sysadmins know that POP and IMAP ( unless wrapped in SSL ) , telnet , and FTP4 send passwords and data in the clear ( unencrypted ) .
They know that PHP , NFS , and portmap have a history of security problems , as well as design defects in their authentication .
Many use them anyway , and then are surprised when they get broken into .
Instead , use spop , simap , ssh , and ssh 's scp or sftp , or put a good firewall in front of that subnet , or set up a restricted VPN between your facilities .
If you absolutely must use PHP , keep it patched and carefully audit your code for problems .
Many programs are secure only if properly configured .
It is common for sysadmins to configure them improperly , sometimes because of a lack of training and understanding of the risks ; other times use of an insecure feature is deliberate , because " I just gotta have it . "
A recent case in point is Apache 's PHP capability , which has had a history of security problems .
These problems have been well publicized , and still some people cannot seem to use it securely or find an alternative .
Security and convenience are often contradictory , and you have to make a choice between the two .
Before deciding to deploy a service ( or changing which capabilities will be used or how the service will be deployed ) , do some research .
Check the security history and understand how the service may be deployed securely .
If it can not be deployed securely , what are secure alternatives ?
I still encounter people using FTP , not realizing that sftp is an excellent alternative .
Putting an insecure service such as NFS behind a firewall may be the solution for some .
For others , putting their insecure Windows networks behind firewalls , with their different offices linked via a VPN between these same Linux firewalls , offers excellent security .
Configure a firewall with separate subnets on separate interfaces for different categories of users , such as students and faculty or sales , human resources , and engineering .
Absolutely prohibit wireless networks inside of the firewall or to any system with confidential information unless all wireless traffic first is encrypted with IPsec or equivalent .
Do not rely on WEP ( Wired Equivalent Privacy ) or its successors .
Web servers and CGI programs are the bane of Linux and Unix computer security .
Simply speaking , a CGI program is one of the easiest ways that a hacker can get into your system .
It is essentially a program that runs on your computer at the request of anyone and everyone without passwords and has the access to do powerful things ( for example , shipping valuable merchandise , revealing confidential data such as your customers ' credit card numbers , and moving money between accounts ) .
A CGI allows anyone to access your Web site , good intentions or not .
While other " accepted " servers such as sendmail and named also will talk with anyone , the scope of what a client may request is far smaller .
Although these latter servers have had their share of serious security bugs , those that keep their security patches up to date have minimal risk .
Here are a few hard and fast rules that will help make your Web site secure .
Know your data ( supplied by Web clients ) .
Establish maximums and minimums for data - entry values and lengths of fields .
Decide which characters are acceptable in each field .
Expect the malicious to send you control characters and non-ASCII bytes .
Expect that crackers will use the % encoding or alternate character sets to generate these evil characters .
Thus , you need to check for illegal characters both before and after % conversion and in different character sets .
Double - check each entered value .
A surprising number of shopping - cart packages put the price of items in the form and believe the price in the filled - out form sent by the user .
All a user needs to do to give himself or herself a discount is to alter this form .
If possible enumerate the allowed values instead of using ranges ( except for listing ranges of letters and digits ) .
Understand , too , that an evil Web client can send bytes back to your server .
The hacker may copy and alter your Web form to change your " fixed " fields , etc .
Use a secure language .
Client - supplied data never should be handed directly to a shell script ; there are too many opportunities for a cracker to get a shell or to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability .
For many that secure language will be C , C++ , Perl , Java , or Python .
If that language offers checking for tainted data , use it .
One language does not fit all .
Perl has a number of features to enable safer CGI programs .
5
These include the " tainted data " feature , the -w flag to warn you about things that you are creating but not using , the strict capability , and perlsec .
These features are discussed in http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsec.html.
These include the " tainted data " feature , the flag to warn you about things that you are creating but not using , the strict capability , and perlsec .
These features are discussed in http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsec.html.
If you have many CGI programs - with a few being carefully written so that they manipulate confidential data , and some that are more casually written because they do not handle critical data - consider the following .
Use the suEXEC program that comes with Apache to run these different classes of CGIs as different Linux or Unix users .
This allows you to use operating system file permissions to prevent the less - trusted CGIs from accessing more confidential data .
Documentation on suEXEC is available at http://apache.org/docs/suexec.html.
Analyze and audit CGIs for vulnerabilities .
When writing CGI programs , look at them the way a cracker would and try to break them .
Stop buffer overflows by using good programming techniques .
An easy way to determine if the line is larger than the buffer is to see that it does not end with a newline character , as this example illustrates :
#include < stdio.h >
#include < string .h >
int c ;
char buf [ 200 ] ;
if (! fgets ( buf , sizeof buf , stdin ) )
error ( ) ;
else if ( ! strchr ( buf , '
' ) ) {
/* Read rest of long line .
*/
while ( ( c = getchar ( ) ) !=
EOF
&& c != '
')
;
overflow ( ) ;
}
Do not use the gets ( ) routine because it does not do any checking for buffer overflows ; use fgets ( ) instead .
Many of the other popular C string functions have similar weaknesses .
The strcpy ( ) function , for example , " lets " you copy a large buffer into a small buffer , overwriting unrelated memory .
The strncpy ( ) function is an excellent alternative .
A safe way to copy strings is :
strncpy ( dest_buf , source_buf ,
sizeof dest_buf ) ;
dest_buf[sizeof dest_buf - 1 ] = ' \0 ' ;
To detect a problem , one possibility is :
if ( strlen ( source_buf )
>= sizeof dest_buf )
error ( ) ;
else
strcpy ( dest_buf , source_buf ) ;
Check for escape sequences , the possibility of a client issuing Linux or Unix commands ( by inserting spaces , quotes , or semicolons ) , binary data , calls to other programs , etc .
Often it is safer to have a list of allowed characters rather than determining each unsafe character .
The following C code may be used to process a field in which the client should supply his or her name .
In this example , the calling process supplies a NUL - terminated string ; this routine returns 0 if the string is a legal name , and - 1 otherwise .
The second argument specifies the maximum legal string allowed , including the terminating NUL byte .
Note that the calling routine must be careful to ensure that its buffer did not overflow .
I chose clear code over slightly more efficient code .
#include < string .h >
char okname [ ] = " .'-,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz "
" ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ " ;
/* Return 0 on legal names , - 1 otherwise . */
legal ( char * name , int maxlen )
{
if (! name || !* name
|| strlen( name ) >= maxlen )
return - 1 ;
while ( * name )
if (! strchr ( okname , * name + + ) )
return - 1 ;
return 0 ;
}
Many system break - ins relating to Linux and Unix Web servers happen via insecure CGIs .
Implement rings of security in CGIs .
Try to design your application so that even if it finds a CGI vulnerability , the system is protected from major damage .
One solution is to have CGIs just be front ends for a solidly written server running on a different machine .
The more hurdles a hacker must jump to reach the goal , the more likely it is that he or she will stumble .
Watch for bug reports in third - party CGIs and inspect their code .
If you use third party - supplied CGI scripts ( such as shopping carts ) , you should subscribe to the appropriate mailing lists and watch for security bulletins .
If possible , get the source code and review it .
If you do not know the language , then get someone who does to review it .
Many CGIs , both commercial and open source , have severe security holes that are well known to the hacker community .
Many locally written CGIs have security vulnerabilities because the programmers who write them typically have no training in writing secure code and such code is rarely audited .
Avoid creating and using set-UID and set - GID programs to the maximum extent possible , especially programs set -UID to root ( and try real hard ) .
Many system programs run as root .
Frequently all these programs need to be set -UID to run as some user to gain access to data that should not be world accessible .
Other programs need to be set -UID to root only when starting to open a low network port for listening or to change its privileges to that of a particular user .
In this case , the program then should give up root privileges .
Apache , named , and ftpd were enhanced several years ago to do this for better security .
Different programs may need to be set -UID to different users to protect them from each other .
Do not keep clients ' confidential data on the Web server .
Avoid storing users ' privileged data ( credit card numbers , financial details , mailing addresses and phone numbers , etc. ) on the same machine as the Web server .
This separation will force a hacker to crack two systems instead of just one to get this data .
Do not include users ' confidential data ( credit card numbers , financial details , mailing addresses and phone numbers , session ID , etc. ) in an URL or cookie .
6
Frequently this is done ( insecurely ) as arguments to a CGI program .
Consider the following example :
www.abroker.com/cgi-bin/address_change?account=666?
passwd=secret&addr=1+Maple+St.&phone=301-688-652
Some browsers may store this URL ( containing confidential data ) in a history file .
If someone is browsing from a public terminal , such as a school or library , you could be liable for careless handling of the data .
Similar issues are present for cookies .
Be very sure that the privileged data that a user supplies on a form does not show up as the default data for the next person to " pull down " that form and see .
Yes , this has actually happened .
Always protect the user who types in a password .
Take the user to a secured area prior to this information being entered and ensure that the password or credit card number will be encrypted on the system ( with https ) before transmission to your server .
SIN FIVE : Insufficient Resources and Misplaced Priorities
At many organizations , management simply will not approve sufficient resources to allow sysadmins to provide good security .
It takes many things to achieve a truly comprehensive security solution .
Education , design , proper implementation , user training , maintenance , and continual vigilance all are required for an organization to be secure .
Frequently , security is limited to what a sysadmin is willing to do on his or her own time .
Yet , a sysadmin who is unwilling to spend the time will certainly be blamed for any violations .
This deadly sin concerns problems that are not the sysadmin 's direct responsibility .
In other words , management will not allow the sysadmin to make the changes necessary for good security .
This may not be a " technical " problem , but it has been the cause of break - ins at numerous organizations .
Lack of resources commonly is a result of misplaced priorities .
For example , the following is a common misconception of those whose organizations have not been broken into :
" The media exaggerates every danger well beyond the true risk . "
Show your manager media accounts of large companies that have suffered security breaches .
If you shopped at T.J. Maxx or Marshalls in 2006 , you probably received a new credit card number thanks to TJX Cos. , the parent company , which suffered a security breach in December .
Circuit City suffered a similar breach .
Consider making a present of Bruce Schneier 's excellent book , Secrets and Lies : Digital Security in a Networked World ( Wiley , 2004 ) , to your boss .
Secrets and Lies is aimed at management and limits the tech - speak .
On a number of occasions , I have warned clients about major security problems only to have them decide that security was not as important as getting that next release out or making nonsecurity - related computer improvements .
Later , they learned the sad reality - recovering from a security breach commonly costs 10 times as much as having implemented good security before the break - in - and only then did they spend the money to implement the security .
Furthermore , the estimate of the cost of recovering from a security breach being 10 times the cost of prevention is only the direct cost .
It does not account for the lost market opportunities for delayed products , the loss of customers who heard about the security breach and went elsewhere , and the costs to customers and employees who could not access your Web site and e-mail during recovery .
It does not account for lost investors and other consequences of bad publicity , and it most certainly does not account for the damage done to an IT professional 's career .
What can be done to resolve insufficient resources and misplaced priorities ?
Spend an hour or two a week working on security as a skunk - works project .
7 Demonstrate a Linux firewall , Web server , or VPN .
Show how easy it is to update Linux software when patches come in , to use ssh and gpg , to crack most passwords , or attack a Wi -Fi wireless network .
Do scans of your network from your home system ( using nmap with the - O flag ) to show how open your network is .
Install Snort and PortSentry outside of your firewall ( if any ) to show how often your network is attacked .
Make a point of talking with your colleagues to get detailed accounts of problems that you can then relay to your management .
Have a good consultant or other trusted outside source do a security audit of your company and recommend improvements .
Giving up leads to procrastination , and procrastination results in compromised systems .
That is the dark side of The Force .
Never give up .
Never surrender .
8
Misplaced priorities can also mean using Microsoft because " We are a Microsoft shop , " disregarding that it may not have sufficient security for servers accessible from the Internet .
SIN SIX : Stale and Unnecessary Accounts
As discussed before , each account is a possible entry point into the system .
A stale account 's password will not be changed , thereby leaving a hole .
If the account has data that needs to be reassigned , disable the account by putting a * or !!
in the ex-user 's password field ( after the first colon ) in the /etc / passwd file .
This disables logging in via that account because no password encrypts into either of these values and shadow password - enabled code understands these sequences .
Get things cleaned up as soon as possible .
Make sure that no set -UID or set - GID programs or publicly readable or writable files containing confidential data remain in that account .
Issuing the following code
chmod 0 /home / someone
find / - user someone -ls
is a good start .
Note that the user may have a mailbox , files in the print spool directory , accounts in various applications , etc. that will need to be attended to .
Some of the services you removed ( while correcting an earlier sin ) have accounts in the /etc / passwd file .
When you remove that service , make sure that the /etc / passwd account also is removed or disabled .
Some of the notables are FTP , NFS , uucp , mail , gopher , and news .
If you do not need them , get rid of them .
SIN SEVEN : Procrastination
In many reports of intrusions the sysadmins say , " I meant to install ...
IP Tables ...
TCP Wrappers ... a newer version of ... a firewall ... turn off NFS and portmap ... stop using PHP ... "
Clearly they knew , at least vaguely , what had to be done but delayed until it was too late .
Sure , you have more responsibilities than time , but consider setting aside an hour twice a week to upgrade security .
Those hours may come with bag lunches at your desk , but that beats a cot in your office so that you can work around the clock for a week recovering from a compromise .
Sadly , I know of one company where they did bring in those cots for a number of engineers during a weeks - long recovery project following a breach .
Worse , they procrastinated on deciding to build a firewall until after this event .

NFS consists of these daemons and a few more , including : rpc.nfsd , rpc.mountd , portmap , rpc.lockd , rpc.statd , rpc.rquotad , and automounter , scattered among a number of startup scripts .
A cracker process can lie to portmap and masquerade as a legitimate server .
NFS has had plenty of security bugs in the past , and its design prevents it from being made secure in many configurations .
Most recent vulnerabilities are not directly exploitable remotely on most systems .
This means that most systems are not at risk for remote attack from the Internet .
Many of the vulnerabilities may be taken advantage of by someone with a regular shell account on the system .
Others are in programs that most people do not use and that are not set - UID or set - GID and thus are not a threat .
This is different from most Windows vulnerabilities where almost every client system or server using that major version of Windows is vulnerable to remote attack over the Internet and thus to complete control by crackers .
We observe that most Windows vulnerabilities affect all Windows versions released in the past four years , including Vista .
We have recently seen Vista included with past versions of Windows for several remote " root " vulnerabilities .

Infringement of EndNote Formats Claimed
Zotero has long been one of my favorite Firefox plug-ins , being a productive and trusted sidekick for collecting and reporting my voluminous citation and bibliographic data .
I think perhaps my review of Zotero from January 2007 was one of my most glowing write - ups .
If you go to the Zotero home page , you will see at the lower left the steady increase of functionality that has come out in this free and open source tool .
For example , Zotero now supports more than 1100 bibliographic sources , can capture Web pages and many standard Web sources , and has MS Office and WordPress support .
Zotero has been developed and is distributed by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University .
Thomson Reuters Sues George Mason University , Virginia
According to the Courthouse News Service with a copy of this complaint filed September 5 , Thomson Reuters is suing George Mason University and , as a state institution , the Commonwealth of Virginia , for $ 10 million in damages and an injunction on further distribution of a beta version of Zotero .
Thomson is seeking a jury trial .
Thomson claims that a July 8 beta release of Zotero ( version 1.5 ) included a new feature to read and convert Thomson ’s 3,500 plus proprietary .ens style files within the EndNote software into free , open source Zotero .csl files .
Thomson claims this is in direct violation with GMU ’s current license for EndNote .
The Zotero beta release introduces a server - side synchronization function ; the standard Zotero release without this feature and the EndNote support is version 1.07 .
EndNote is a proprietary and popular citation software used by many academics and researchers .
EndNote has very similar functionality to Zotero .
It allows users to search online bibliographic databases , organize them , and store and re-format citations in various publication styles .
Single user licenses are $ 250 with volume and academic discounts available .
Thomson claims “ millions ” of ultimate users .
Thomson Reuters is also the firm behind the Open Calais named entity extraction service noted much in the semantic Web community ( and which this week announced a commercial version ) .
File format ingest and conversions have long been a mainstay of interoperable software systems .
This lawsuit will bear close monitoring .

Immune mold cells rely on ‘ sunshine ’ nutrient to round infectionVitamin D is vital grease activating human defenses and low levels suffered by around half the world 's population may repellent their immune systems ' killer T cells are fortuneless at fighting infection , scientists said .
The findings by Danish researchers could help the fight against infectious diseases and global epidemics , they vocal Sunday , further could serve as particularly apropos in the search as larger vaccines .
The researchers found that proof systems ' killer cells , known owing to T cells , rely on vitamin D to turn into active and forge ahead quiescent and mindless of the preference of threat from an ailment or pathogen if vitamin D is lacking domination the blood .

" This means the T cell compulsion have vitamin D or activation of the cell consign cease .

CSS vendor prefixes considered harmful
I recently came across a post about border - radius by the IE team , that said IE9 supports border - radius ( cool ! ) without vendor prefix ( even cooler ! )
The post continues :
While a number of web pages already make use of this feature , some [...] do not render properly in IE9 or Opera 10.50 because they lack an unprefixed declaration of the border - radius property .
As the specification nears Recommendation and browser vendors are working on their final implementations and testcases for submission to the W3C , we recommend that new content always include a border - radius declaration without vendor prefix .
I ’d like to go one step further .
It ’s time to abolish all vendor prefixes .
They ’ve become solutions for which there is no problem , and they are actively harming web standards .
Vendor prefixes force web developers to make their style sheets much more verbose than is necessary , while also running the risk of accidentally forgetting one set of vendor - prefixed declarations .
Besides , why do we need to use several declarations for obtaining one single effect ?
Were n’t web standards supposed to prevent that sort of thing ?
Guys , let ’s stop the vendor prefix nonsense .
Enough ’s enough .
Update :
Although the problem is real , my solution is not the best one possible .
See the redux for more discussion .
The point
Originally , the point of vendor prefixes was to allow browser makers to start supporting experimental CSS declarations .
Let ’s say a W3C working group is discussing a grid declaration ( which , incidentally , would n’t be such a bad idea ) .
Let ’s furthermore say that some people create a draft specification , but others disagree with some of the details .
As we know , this process may take ages .
Let ’s furthermore say that Microsoft as an experiment decides to implement the proposed grid .
At this point in time , Microsoft cannot be certain that the specification will not change .
Therefore , instead of adding grid to its CSS , it adds - ms - grid .
The vendor prefix kind of says “ this is the Microsoft interpretation of an ongoing proposal . ”
Thus , if the final definition of grid is different , Microsoft can add a new CSS property grid without breaking pages that depend on - ms - grid
Now in itself this is a reasonable line of thought .
Point is , it ’s outlived its usefulness .
It ’s just not necessary any more , neither from a practical nor from a more philosophical point of view .
Practical problems
Let ’s take a look at some practical cases .
box - sizing
One place where vendor prefixes have always annoyed me terribly is the box - sizing property that allows you to switch from one box model to another .
Currently IE8 and Opera support box - sizing without prefix , but Firefox supports only - moz - box - sizing and Safari , Chrome , and all mobile WebKits only - webkit - box - sizing .
In other words , this is the code to switch the box model of one div .
div.borderbox { box -sizing : border - box ; /* one */ - moz - box - sizing : border - box ; /* two */ - webkit - box - sizing : border - box ; /* three */ }
The fact that I have to use three declarations for obtaining one effect is completely preposterous .
We might as well live in the Browser Wars era .
Standards , anyone ?
The point here is that box - sizing will not change any more .
Its purpose is to switch box models , and its two values border - box and content - box are supported everywhere .
This declaration makes sense as it is , and it is supported by all browsers as it is .
So it should have the same name in every browser .
Why wait for W3C to put its stamp of approval on it before removing the prefixes ?
We all know that ’s going to take another five to ten years .
Mozilla , WebKit , you ’re just being thoughtlessly conservative here .
Get rid of your vendor prefixes .
Transitions
Consider the transitions Safari added .
They ’re all prefixed with - webkit- .
Here , too , the point is that the Safari team has effectively specified all these declarations .
They ’re not going to change any more .
Google and Opera are implementing transitions , too .
I studied the Apple and Opera documentations a bit , and they look quite alike .
In fact , right now I dare state that Opera is working to copy Apple ’s transitions system .
But Apple uses - webkit - transition , while Opera is using -o- transition .
Guys ...
div.coolEffect { - webkit - transition - property : opacity ; /* one */ - webkit- transition - duration : 2s ; -o- transition - property : opacity ; /* two */ -o- transition - duration : 2s ; - moz - transition - property : opacity ; /* three */ - moz - transition - duration : 2s ; - ms- transition - property : opacity ; /* four */ -ms-transition - duration : 2s ; }
I do n’t want to use four browser - specific declarations to obtain one effect !
This sort of vendor - specific nonsense is exactly what web standards were supposed to do away with .
No more bloody fragmentation !
What if a web developer accidentally forgets one vendor prefix ?
Then the effect wo n’t work while it could — something we ’ve learned to recognise as a grave sin .
Still , it ’s bound to happen in a standardless world .
Enough ’s enough .
Vendor prefixes have to go .
A peek into the future
The most idiotic example comes from the mobile world .
Opera has implemented a touchscreen media query in the Vodafone widget manager , and called it -o - touchscreen .
When Samsung started to work on its WebKit - based widget manager , it was notified of the existence of this media query and promptly copied it .
To the letter .
Thus , we now have a WebKit browser reacting to -o- touchscreen .
And this is just the beginning .
It ’s going to get much , much worse .
Eventually Opera will discover that plenty of sites use - webkit - transition , but not -o- transition .
Will Opera start to support - webkit - transition , too ?
From a compatibility perspective that might make sense .
From any other perspective it ’s totally ridiculous , though .
And there ’s a simple solution to this problem : transition has become a de-facto web standard .
So treat it as one .
Let ’s stop the vendor prefix nonsense .
Now .
Philosophical problems
So from a practical perspective vendor prefixes are turning into a tool for fragmentation .
From a philosophical perspective , moreover , they solve problems that just are n’t there any more .
As far as I can see vendor prefixes were supposed to solve two problems :
The problem with unfinished standards I outlined earlier .
The problem underlying that problem : an automatic assumption that , when left to their own devices , browser vendors would all start to implement their own stuff without paying attention to what the other browsers were doing .
Both problems have meanwhile been solved , as far as I can see .
We ’re currently moving toward a situation in which anything that is implemented by two browsers more - or - less automatically becomes a standard .
I do n’t think that this change of process has been accepted by W3C yet ( it might take another generation ) , but it ’s becoming reality as we speak .
The reason this system can work is because browser vendors now want to copy each other ’s implementations !
Microsoft , Mozilla , Apple , Google , and Opera are all eyeing each other ’s browsers and want to resemble each other in standards support , while competing in execution excellence , interface smoothness , and standards extension .
Contrary to the Browser Wars era when vendor prefixes were defined , right now browser vendors are genuinely interested in interoperability .
There is no danger any of them will go off on a wild tangent and , I do n’t know , redefine box - sizing : border - box to mean “ anything inside the border . ”
That sort of thing just does n’t make sense any more today .
The Safari team invented cool , new transition stuff .
They made it CSS - based , documented it , and submitted it to W3C .
That ’s all good .
Then they added the - webkit- prefix .
That ’s bad .
Now Opera comes along , and wants to support transitions , too .
Is Opera going to invent its own system ?
Is Opera suddenly going to give transition a completely different meaning that is totally incompatible with Safari’s ?
Of course not !
The Opera guys are n’t crazy .
They know their bread is buttered on the compatibility side of things .
The same goes for all other browser vendors .
But they do add their own vendor prefix .
That ’s ridiculous .
And pointless .
transition and all the rest have become de-facto standards .
Any browser implementing the transition system will make sure that it is compatible with Safari .
So who needs vendor prefixes ?
Dear browser vendors , take a little more pride in your willingness to work with your competitors towards web standards , even when you invent new functionality .
You do not need vendor prefixes any more .
You ’ve grown beyond them .
The time has come to abolish all vendor prefixes .
They ’ve become fossils of a bygone era , but with the potential to harm web standards significantly .
Update :
Although the problem is real , my solution is not the best one possible .

Video » Raw Footage : February 26 Riot in the streets of Berkeley
In the early hours of Feb. 26 , a riot broke out on the streets south of the UC Berkeley campus .
Chaos ensued as the mob danced , chanted and resorted to vandalism .
Contributing Writers
A crowd of more than 200 people swarmed the streets of Southside early Friday morning in a riot involving seven law enforcement agencies , runaway dumpsters , flaming trash cans , shattered windows and violent clashes between rioters and police .
What began as a dance party on Upper Sproul Plaza led to an occupation of Durant Hall at around 11:15 p.m.
Thursday to raise support for the March 4 statewide protest in support of public education .
According to a statement distributed by the occupiers , the building was selected because of its symbolic nature .
Durant Hall formerly housed the campus East Asian Library and the campus Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures .
It is now being renovated to become office space for the College of Letters and Science , which spurred activists to " reclaim " the space for students .
UCPD Captain Margo Bennett said the occupiers " cut a lock to get into the construction area and then cut a lock to get into the building " before vandalizing the area .
" There were windows broken , there was spray painting and graffiti on the interior , there was construction equipment that was tossed around , " she said .
The occupation evolved into a riot as it moved onto streets south of campus , where a protester broke several windows of the Subway at Bancroft Way and Telegraph Avenue at about 1:41 a.m .
Bennett said the occupiers were able to leave Durant Hall without police confrontation because UCPD did not have adequate staffing and the Berkeley Police Department had not responded to the scene per UCPD request before the occupiers left .
She added that UCPD believes many of the occupiers were not UC Berkeley students .
" Because of their manner of dress and their behavior , they did not resemble the students that we have become accustomed to dealing with over the past six months , " she said .
After moving off campus , the group grew and settled at Durant and Telegraph avenues .
Officers from UCPD , Oakland , BART and Albany police departments , as well as the California Highway Patrol and the Alameda County Sherriff 's Office , responded to the scene .
All but four Berkeley Police Department officers on duty that night were dispatched to address the incident , according to Berkeley police Dispatcher Rayna Johnson .
" It 's a little hectic , " Johnson said .
Berkeley and UCPD officers stood shoulder - to - shoulder in a line on Telegraph Ave. facing the dancing crowd , which had formed around a stereo system blaring music from a shopping cart .
The tone of the gathering changed at about 1:55 a.m. when a dumpster was pushed into the center of the intersection and set on fire by members of the crowd .
The Berkeley Fire Department responded as people danced on top of the dumpster and shouted , " Whose street ?
Our street ! "
Employees of the Blakes on Telegraph bar and restaurant brought out buckets of water and fire extinguishers to douse the flames .
Officers physically pushed the crowd back so that Berkeley fire personnel could extinguish the flames .
Sporadic fights broke out within the crowd , causing police to advance their line on the growing mob and use batons to push it back .
Two officers suffered minor injuries but did not require medical attention , according to a Berkeley Police Department press release .
Members of the crowd hurled glass bottles , plastic buckets , pizza and other objects at the police line .
The crowd 's size and intensity fluctuated as the police and protesters clashed and multiple members of the crowd were detained by police .
Marika Goodrich , 28 , a UC Berkeley senior , was arrested at the intersection of Durant and Telegraph avenues and booked for assault on a police officer , inciting a riot and resisting arrest , according to Berkeley police Officer Andrew Frankel .
Zachary Miller , 26 , a UC Berkeley alumnus and an organizer for the " Rolling University , " was also arrested at the intersection and was booked for inciting a riot , resisting arrest and obstructing a police officer .
Goodrich is being held on $ 32,500 bail and Miller is being held on $ 22,500 bail .
Both are being held at the Berkeley City Jail and are scheduled to be arraigned March 1 , according to Alameda County records .
No arrests were made on campus , according to Bennett .
At about 2:43 a.m. , the mob accompanied the shopping cart as it traveled east on Durant .
As the crowd moved , a white Dodge Charger turned onto the street and people ran alongside the car as it advanced , a practice commonly referred to as " ghost riding the whip . "
Around 2:55 a.m. , the crowd settled on College Ave. outside the Unit 1 residence halls , where some members propelled a dumpster down Durant Ave. toward police .
About 15 minutes later , after the crowd launched a second dumpster down Durant Avenue , a line of police vehicles charged through the streets , scattering the crowd in all directions .
Police ended the riot at approximately 3:15 a.m .
When the crowd had left Durant Hall earlier in the night , UCPD Chief Mitch Celaya said the main concern for police was to assess the damage thus far and monitor the crowd as it proceeded down Telegraph Avenue .
" We 're going to hopefully secure the exterior , " he said .
" We 're going to take a look to see what , if any , kind of damage has been caused .
We 're concerned about the group as they march around , that they do n't commit any acts of vandalism , not just to our property but to the city . "
Although the occupation had been planned , the decision to move off campus could not be attributed to any one person , according to Callie Maidhof , a representative for the occupiers .
" If you get all these people here , what they decide to do is what matters , " Maidhof said .
" It 's not whoever may or may not have planned it , that 's irrelevant at a certain point . "
Chancellor Robert Birgeneau , Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost George Breslauer and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Harry Le Grande , condemned the occupation and subsequent riot in a statement sent Friday to the campus community where they said they believe the majority of the occupiers were not UC Berkeley students .
" Initial investigation indicates that about 100 people came onto campus with clear intent to break into at Durant Hall , " they said in the statement .
" Sadly , such action does incredible damage to our advocacy efforts with Sacramento and with the California public to preserve public higher education . "
Shaunt Attarian , Chris Carrassi , Tomer Ovadia , Sarah Springfield , Zach E.J. Williams and Mihir Zaveri of The Daily Californian contributed to this report .
An incredible 98 House Democrats have signed the Polis - Pingree letter since last week -- calling on Harry Reid to pass the public health insurance option through " reconciliation , " which only needs a simple majority to pass the Senate .
This momentum is thanks in large part to tens of thousands of people who called their local House Democrat and asked them to sign .
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee ( where I'm a campaigner ) , Democracy for America , and Credo Action set up WhipCongress.com where you can see if your representative has signed the letter -- and if not , call them .
( We give you a script , it 's easy . )
We 're trying to reach 100 signers today -- and today 's officially the last day for them to sign .

I try to find a good solution on the Internet , but all I got is
Put
completeopt += menuone , longest
in your .vimrc
It does provide a longest common text of auto - complete FOR THE FIRST TIME .
After I type one more character and press < tab > , it just starts to move on the popup menu .
No more longest common text of all matches anymore .
To work around this , I hacked the SuperTab to provide longest common text .
Here is how :
open supertab.vim in your / plugin directory find function !
s:SuperTab( command ) change the code
" handle ' context ' completion .
if b:complType == ' context '
let complType = s:ContextCompletion ( )
if complType == ''

, since VIM will do longest common text before the popup menu appears .

The Small Business Administration on Tuesday unveiled a proposed rule that would finally implement a law intended to increase the share of federal contracts to women - owned firms .
The law , originally passed by Congress in 2000 , allows federal agencies to set aside contracts for small businesses owned by women in industries that the S.B.A. determines “ are underrepresented with respect to Federal procurement contracting . ”
According to the S.B.A. ( pdf ) , the agency has found 83 industries ( pdf ) where women - owned small businesses are “ under - represented or substantially under - represented . ”
In those industries ( defined by the North American Industrial Classification System , or NAICS , which comprises 313 broad industrial categories ) , a federal contract officer can restrict competition for contracts worth less than $ 3 million , or $ 5 million for manufacturers , to women - owned firms .
Generally speaking , women must control and own at least 51 percent of the company and be United States citizens as well as “ economically disadvantaged . ”
In industries where women are substantially under - represented , however , the S.B.A. can waive the disadvantaged requirement .
“ We ’re very pleased to see the S.B.A. finally moving , ” said Margot Dorfman , chief executive of the U.S. Women ’s Chamber of Commerce , which says it has 500,000 members , mostly small - business owners .
“ Women own nearly one - third of all businesses in the United States , but we only receive 3 percent of federal contracts . ”
Or more precisely : not more than 3.4 percent in 2008 .
Federal law sets a goal — not a requirement — that 5 percent of all government contracts go to women - owned firms .
Last fall , the U.S. Women ’s Chamber concluded that the $ 12 billion difference between the goal and reality in 2008 amounted to the “ largest shortfall ever . ”
The 5 percent goal has never been met since it became law in 1994 , which is what prompted Congress to create contract set - asides 10 years ago .
However , by some accounts , the Bush administration had little interest in the law .
Ms. Dorfman said that in 2004 , then - S.B.A. Administrator Hector Barreto told her that “ the S.B.A. had no intention of implementing the program . ”
( Mr. Barreto , now chairman of the Latino Coalition , a Hispanic small - business advocacy organization , did not return a phone call seeking comment . )
After Mr. Barreto resigned in 2006 , his successor , Steven Preston , moved to establish the Women ’s Procurement Program , as it was known — but with limitations .
For one thing , federal agencies were put in the awkward position of having to individually certify that they had discriminated against women - owned businesses in the past before the program would apply to them .
Moreover , the S.B.A. ’s proposed rule initially determined that women were under - represented — and set - asides could occur — in just four industries .
The Bush administration ’s final proposed rule ( subsequently withdrawn by the incoming Obama administration ) expanded this to 31 industries .
The rule proposed by the Obama administration this week further expands the field to 83 industries , and removes the department - by - department certification .
Backers of the program in Congress greeted the S.B.A. ’s proposed rule with guarded optimism .
“ After three Congressional reports , numerous Congressional hearings , two proposed rules , one highly deficient final rule , and nearly a decade of delay , today ’s announcement is long overdue , ” said Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine , the ranking Republican on the Small Business Committee , in a statement released by her office .
The Democratic chair of the committee , Mary Landrieu of Louisiana , described the announcement as “ a step in the right direction . ”
Australia ’s population rose a brisk 2.1 per cent last year , just a whisker from the fastest pace in four decades and a boost to demand for everything from consumer goods to housing and infrastructure .
Government data out today showed 451,900 more people called Australia home in the 12 months to end September , taking the total to 22.07 million .
The growth pace of 2.1 per cent was almost twice the global average of 1.1 per cent , and far above most rich nations .
The natural rate of increase , births minus deaths , stood at 154,500 , while net migration added 297,400 .
The Bureau of Statistics also revised up past immigration numbers to show a net addition of 77,300 people in the two years to September .
The rapid rise in population helped Australia dodge a recession last year as the global financial crisis raged .

Washington ( CNN ) --
Democratic congressional leaders Wednesday demanded Republicans join them in condemning a spate of threats and vandalism that has followed Sunday 's vote on a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. health care system .
More than 10 Democrats have reported trouble since the weekend vote , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters .
Windows have been smashed at Democratic offices in at least three states , and federal agents were investigating whether a cut gas line at the home of a Virginia congressman 's brother was related to the lawmaker 's yes vote .
Democracy " is not about violence , " Hoyer said at a news conference with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn , the No. 3 Democrat in the House of Representatives .
" Both of us believe that to remain silent in the face of such activity gives the impression of either condoning or sanctioning such actions , " added Hoyer , D - Maryland .
The top Republican in the House , Minority Leader John Boehner , told reporters that he has urged opponents to demonstrate legally .
" I 've made statements that I understand people are angry , but violence and threats are inappropriate and irresponsible , " the Ohio congressman said .
" If people are angry , they ought to register to vote and get involved in a campaign . "
The white - hot rhetoric that dominated the last several months of debate on the historic health care bill culminated in unruly protests by the Tea Party movement at the Capitol over the weekend .
Three African - American House Democrats , including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis of Georgia , reported protesters shouted racial slurs at them and spit at one of them , while Rep. Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , an openly gay House member , had anti-gay slurs yelled at him .
One House member mentioned a map on the Facebook page of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during a Wednesday meeting on safety concerns , a Democratic source said .
The map shows 20 House Democratic political targets believed to be vulnerable in the upcoming midterm elections -- some have already announced their retirements .
Their home districts are marked with cross hairs .
Mention of the map brought audible groans to the room , the source said .
Republican
House members encouraged protesters outside and inside the House gallery , some of whom carried messages like " Vote no or else " or " If Brown wo n't stop it , a Browning will " -- a reference to newly elected Massachusetts Sen.
Scott Brown accompanied by a silhouette of a pistol .
Since the vote , an Alabama blogger has launched a " window war " against Democrats and has kept a tally of the recent incidents of damage , including ones in upstate New York , Arizona and Kansas .
A message left for Michigan Democrat Bart Stupak , whose last - minute decision to support the bill helped give Democrats the votes it needed to pass , warned that " there are millions of people across the country who wish you ill , and all of those thoughts projected on you will materialize into something that 's not very good for you . "
Clyburn , who is African - American , said he has received a fax in his office with a picture of a noose drawn on it and had threatening telephone calls at his home .
i Report : ' A very dangerous time for Obama '
" We 're giving aid and comfort to these people , and this stuff gets ratcheted up , " Clyburn told CNN .
" We in this Congress have got to come together in a bipartisan way and tamp this foolishness down .
It does n't make sense .
That 's not what a democracy is all about . "
Hoyer told a news conference that " a significant number , meaning over 10 " lawmakers had reported either threats , vandalism or other incidents .
Capitol police officials have briefed House Democrats on reporting suspicious or threatening activity and taking precautions to avoid " subjecting themselves or their families to physical harm , " he said .
Rep. Louise Slaughter , D - New York , said her Niagara Falls district office had a brick thrown through one of its windows and a message that referred to " snipers " was left on one of her campaign offices .
In a written statement , she said GOP leaders have been " fanning the flames with coded rhetoric . "
And Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen blamed Republicans for encouraging heated rhetoric over the bill .
" There 's a real feeling that some of the comments from the Republican leaders and Republicans are not tamping down the fire , they are throwing fuel on the fire .
And that is totally inappropriate , " Van Hollen said .
But Boehner , who compared the legislation 's passage to " Armageddon , " said Democrats had not complained to him that Republicans have n't been quick enough to condemn the threats and vandalism .
Clyburn said his wife has forwarded the phone numbers from the calls to law enforcement agencies .
Slaughter said federal agents and local authorities were investigating the threat and vandalism at her offices .
And in Virginia , Albemarle County fire marshals and the FBI are looking into the slashing of a propane gas line outside the home of Rep .
Tom Perriello 's brother , the congressman 's office said .
A Perriello aide told CNN that a line to the propane tank on the brother 's gas grill had been severed after the brother 's home address was posted online by a Tea Party activist .
Lee Catlin , a spokesman for the fire marshal 's office , said the incident " did not involve an immediate threat to occupants of the residence " but would disclose no details .
The county joined the investigation late Tuesday after a request from the FBI , Caitlin said .
" Officials are taking the incident very seriously and conducting a vigorous investigation , " he said .
Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck told his radio audience Monday that Democrats who supported the bill would be remembered as " an enemy of the republic " and " an enemy to the Constitution . "
But he urged viewers of his Fox News television show Wednesday to avoid violence , because " radical " supporters of the Obama administration are counting on such attacks to discredit their opposition , he said .
" Not only is it completely nuts and wrong , it 's exactly what they want , " Beck said .
He told viewers , " They are begging for it .
You are being set up . "
But in Kansas , Democrats in Wichita are seeking to raise money over a brick thrown through the window of the party headquarters .
" At first , we thought our office was just the object of a random act of bitter violence , but now we know that 's not the case , " said the Sedgewick County Democratic Party 's Web site .
" This attack was instigated , encouraged and directed by an ultra- right wing blogger and similar events occurred all over the country . "
The Web site item asked for donations to " help us get back to work . "
CNN 's Deirdre Walsh , Dana Bash , Lesa Jansen and Tom Cohen contributed to this report .
GOPÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s goal is to ‘ prevent governability , ’ renowned scholar tells Raw Story
The nature of the current recession has made it clear to most Americans that a new wave of financial reforms is necessary to prevent another crash .
MIT professor Noam Chomsky alleged that the Democratic establishmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s reluctance to reestablish post -Depression type regulations is reflective of the systemic constraints on policy in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ dysfunctional democracy .
Ã¢â‚¬Â

Chomsky , who has written many books detailing the perils of corporate influence in politics , said in an interview that the president and his party are hamstrung by fears that banks will punish them if they implement policies that do not satisfy the industry ’s desires .
President Obama Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ is delivering , but for the financial institutions , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he told Raw Story , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ Which is nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t a big surprise Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that was the core of his funding .
They preferred him to McCain , in fact by a considerable margin .
They expected a payoff , and they got a payoff .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
The Obama administration last month walked into a public relations debacle after the president told Bloomberg News in an interview that he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ begrudgeÃ¢â‚
¬
Â banking executives making large bonuses for their Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ savvyÃ¢â ‚ ¬
Â skills .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ That was very revealing , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Chomsky said , alleging that Obama was merely heeding the threats from the banking community .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Obama months ago shifted his rhetoric and started talking about greedy bankers and even made some policy proposals the financial institutions didnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t like , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he continued .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ And they did nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t waste a minute .
They told him right off , you continue talking like that and weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re going to shift our funding to Republicans .
Well they did so .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 

One day before the interview , the New York Times reported that J.P. Morgan , which has traditionally preferred contributing to Democrats , directed most of its cash to the GOP this year .
Campaign finance trends on OpenSecrets.org reveal that financial institutions have gradually shifted their funding away from the Democratic Party and toward Republicans in recent months .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ And Obama got the message , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Chomsky said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Within days , he said to Bloomberg that the bankers are great guys , IÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m in favor of their profits and bonuses and so on ; that that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the way the free market works , and I join the American people in applauding their successes .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ These are the same American people who are screaming bloody murder about all this , so that tells you something about how the country works , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he added .
ADVERTISEMENT
GOPÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœgoalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ is to win back power by Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœmaking the country ungovernableÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢
ChomskyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s verdict on Obama and the Democrats may have been damning , but his take on Republicans was scathing .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The Republican Party has transformed itself , since Reagan but much more extensively now , into a new kind of political operation , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he told Raw Story .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s abandoned really any political programs .
Its only goal has been to prevent governability .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
The MIT professor said the GOPÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s posturing as a small - government populist organization has been a disingenuous strategy to capitalize on nationwide anger and defeat Democrats .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ When critics call it the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœparty of noÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re pretty much correct , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he continued .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ They basically want to make the country ungovernable so that they can regain power and dedicate themselves to their actual constituency Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ which is not tea party activists but corporate power .
Ã¢â‚¬Â

Chomsky predicted the November elections wonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t be easy on the majority party , as Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ enthusiasm among Republicans is far higher than among Democrats , who are largely apathetic now .

Commission seeks to block child porn websites Proposal also calls for mandatory sentences for human traffickers .
The European Commission has proposed that websites containing child pornography should be blocked across the European Union and that maximum sentences of five to ten years should be imposed on human traffickers .
The measures are part of a legislative package to combat human trafficking and the sexual exploitation of children announced by Cecilia Malmström , the European commissioner for home affairs , in Brussels today ( 29 March ) .
Malmström also announced that the Commission will appoint an anti-trafficking co-ordinator “ very soon ” .
Blocking websites is controversial among the member states , whose endorsement , together with that of the European Parliament , is needed for the two directives to take effect .
Officials expect fierce disagreements among member states and MEPs as they debate the draft directives , which are likely to be watered down in the process .
However , under the Lisbon treaty individual member states can no longer block legislation in the field of justice and home affairs .
Malmström said that she would now work with MEPs and member states to impress on them that acting on these “ heinous crimes ” was imperative .
She said that both Spain and Belgium – the current and next holder of the EU ’s rotating presidency – were “ eager ” to move on the matter .
She said that the power to block access to websites would be limited to child pornography and would not be used to block other content .
“ Child pornography is not about freedom of expression , ” she said .
Jan Philipp Albrecht , a German Green MEP , has called on the Commission and the Council of Ministers to “ abandon their plans for an EU internet censorship directive ” .
“ Filtering certain content on the web is counter - productive for the real take - down of illegal websites and constitutes a threat to liberal democracy , ” he said .
“ There is a slippery slope from filtering child abuse and other illegal websites to filtering unwanted or politically unfavourable content . ”
Malmström said that blocking websites was not a “ substitute for removing content ” but a pragmatic measure to prevent people from seeing it .
She pointed out that the Scandinavian countries , the UK and Italy already had similar measures in place .
“ It works in practice , ” she said .
The proposals would leave it up to member states to determine the exact methods with which to block access but would set up legal safeguards to ensure that they were effectively blocked .
The draft trafficking directive also foresees improved support for victims , including the provision of shelter and medical and psychological assistance .
EU sex tourists would face prosecution in their home country if they abused children outside the EU , and prohibitions on contact with children imposed by one member state would be effective across the EU .
There was a doleful inevitability following the final scenes of the fourth Indiana Jones film that the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was not the last big screen plundering Dr Jones would do .
Though it took nearly two decades for George Lucas and Steven Spielberg to make The Last Crusade an inaccurate title , the fourth film did n’t excite or enthrall to the very high standards the series had set for itself .
Reliance on CG and the divisive inclusion of Indy Jr. Jr. into the mix made the film seem less like the Indy of old , and though the subtle ( and the not - so - subtle ) nods to the series ’ legacy reminded us of the glory days of Harrison Ford ’s iconic adventurer it also underlined the failings of the film .
Now the BBC are reporting that the story is already taking shape , Harrison Ford had this to say ,
Steven [ Spielberg ] and George [ Lucas ] and I are sort of agreed on a germ of an idea and we ’re seeing what comes of it .
The process works like this …We come to some basic agreement and then George goes away for a long time and works on it .
Then Steven and I get it in some form , some embryonic form .
Then if we like it we start working with George on it and at some point down the line it ’s ready and we do it
Several other ideas came and went for another Indy film while the KotCS was being prepared , Frank Darabont was supposed to have had The City of the Gods as a subtitle for one of his scripts , tales of Monkey Kings and Saucer Men from Mars were all mentioned in the rumour haze before aliens with crystal skulls finally materialised – so one can only wonder at the concepts being worked on at the moment .
Can I suggest Indiana Jones and the End of the Road ?

The Obama administration is n’t backing down on criticisms of an Israeli plan to build 1600 new homes in East Jerusalem .
Israel announced the plan just as Vice President Joe Biden was visiting the country .
President Obama ’s chief political adviser condemned the move Sunday .
“ This was an affront , it was an insult , ” David Axelrod told NBC ’s Tom Brokaw .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ But most importantly , it undermined this very fragile effort to bring peace to that region , ” he said .
“ We just now have started proximity talks , shuttle diplomacy between the Palestinians and the Israelis .
For this announcement to come at that time was very destructive . ”
Fox News ’ Bill Kristol responded to Axelrod by defending the Israelis .
“ No one doubts this is part of Israel .
This little apartment building is going to be part of Israel .
No different from Palestinians building apartment buildings in Ramallah .
It ’s ludicrous that it became a big issue , ” said Kristol .
The story made international headlines Friday as the Middle East Quartet — the European Union , the United States , Russia and the United Nations — condemned “ Israel ’s decision to advance planning for new housing units in East Jerusalem . ”
“ The Quartet reaffirms that unilateral actions taken by either party cannot prejudge the outcome of negotiations and will not be recognized by the international community , ” it added in a statement .

As members of the Obama administration and Congress met on Thursday to try to find common ground on health care , a new report warned that without comprehensive legislation , more than 275,000 adults nationwide will die over the next decade because of a lack of health insurance .
Nearly 14,000 of those deaths would occur in New York State .
An earlier study by the Institute of Medicine estimated that 18,000 people died prematurely in 2000 because they lacked insurance ; the Urban Institute updated that figure to 22,000 in 2006 .
The new study , by liberal advocacy group Families USA , applied the same methodology used in the previous reports to drill down and calculate , on both a national and state - by - state basis , the latest figures .
“ This is only the tip of the iceberg , and the most severe consequence , which is death , ” said Kathleen Stoll , director of health policy at Families USA .
In addition , thousands of other citizens , perhaps millions , are experiencing a reduction in the quality of their lives and their health because they lack insurance , she said .
Not surprisingly , many of the states with the largest number of projected premature deaths also have the largest populations .
The top 12 states , in order of estimated premature deaths , are : California ( 34,600 ) , Texas ( 31,700 ) , Florida ( 25,400 ) , New York ( 13,900 ) , Georgia ( 11,500 ) , North Carolina ( 9,600 ) , Illinois ( 9,400 ) , Ohio ( 8,900 ) , Louisiana ( 7,700 ) , Michigan ( 7,600 ) , Pennsylvania ( 7,500 ) and Tennessee ( 7,500 ) .
In 2008 , roughly 46 million people in the United States lacked health insurance , according to the Census Bureau .
The new report estimates that currently 68 adults under age 65 die every day because they do n’t have coverage .
Absent a significant change in coverage , the figure will climb to 84 by 2019 , the study projects .
A growing body of research has explored the connection between a lack of health insurance and an increased risk of death .
Uninsured people are more likely to skip screenings and other preventive care , so their medical problems are often diagnosed later , when they are more advanced and tougher to treat .
The uninsured are also more likely to skimp on necessary medical care , whether it ’s prescription drugs to keep their blood pressure in check or surgery to clear up clogged arteries .
“ The bottom line is that if you do n’t get a disease picked up early and you do n’t get necessary treatment , you ’re more likely to die , ” said Stan Dorn , a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and the author of the organization ’s earlier study .
Experts say that the new study ’s estimates of premature death likely err on the conservative side .
The report calculated that lack of insurance increased mortality rates by 25 percent .
But research conducted using more recent data found that not having insurance increases death rates by 40 percent .
In addition , these numbers do n’t include children .
Children are generally very healthy , and many are eligible for coverage under public programs like the state Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
But many children are n’t enrolled in Medicaid or other programs for which they ’re eligible .
According to research cited in the Families USA study , hospital mortality rates were 60 percent higher for children without insurance .
In addition to projecting premature deaths , the new study estimated the number of people who had died since the last major push for health care legislation in the early 1990s .
It found that between 1995 and 2009 , lack of insurance was responsible for more than 290,000 premature deaths .
Any estimate of this sort depends on the type of health care legislation under discussion .
For this report , Families USA relied on Congressional Budget Office estimates regarding the bills that were passed by the House and the Senate , which would increase the number of insured by some 30 million .
A health overhaul like the one proposed by Republicans , which would increase the number of insured by about three million , would yield much less bang for the buck .
“ Clearly you would n’t see the same amelioration of the consequences , ” Ms. Stoll said .
North Carolina head coach Roy Williams has previously demonstrated his complete lack of perspective on more than one occasion , but he still wants you to know that the Haitian earthquake was nothing compared to losing to Virginia at home .

" Our massage therapist told me , ' You know , coach , what happened in Haiti is a catastrophe .
What you 're having is a disappointment , ' " said Williams .
" I told her that depends on what chair you 're sitting in .
It does feel like a catastrophe to me , because it is my life . "

You heard that right .
A 2 - 6 ACC record is a catastrophe — if it happens to Roy Williams .
Remember , this is a conversation he had with his massage therapist .
You know who I bet could use a massage right now ?
Evan Muncie .
He was pulled from the rubble of a Port - au - Prince marketplace ...
YESTERDAY .
Twenty seven days after the earthquake struck .
You know what his first words were ?
" Wait , they lost to Maryland ?
Holy shit , the Tar Heels suck balls ! "
And if anyone is thinking of pulling out the old " that was totally taken out context ! " nonsense , just stop .
No matter how condescending your masseuse sounds when she reminds you that Haiti 's problems are worse than yours , you say , " You 're right " and then shut up .
You do n't contradict her , then run to reporters for sympathy with your white whine .
Even if it 's a joke , it 's not fucking funny .

Then again , Roy Williams is not exactly known as a master of empathy :
* When asked last year if he would be willing to give back his state - funded salary to help with struggling budgets , Williams — who earns a base salary of $ 333,000 , before bonuses , endorsements and speaking fees — responded that he was the " most sensitive person in this room to the state of our nation 's economy , " because his son was recently laid off .

* After winning his 600th career game in November , Williams took time out from the celebration to chastise several hundred fans who paid for tickets to the non-conference game against Nevada , but did not show up .
( The game , which was a sellout , took place on the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend . )
* During a December game against Presbyterian , Williams turned his attention from the action on the court to have a fan ejected from the " Carolina " seats , because he was heckling Tar Heel players .
" I just do n't think anybody should yell negative things toward our players ( when ) you come in on our tickets to watch our game . "

Hey , Roy ?

Duke - North Carolina clash lacking luster , but stakes still high [ SI.com ]
Update : Video of Roy 's quote in this story from WRAL [ via Buster Sports ] :
State officials say a Greece - style financial crisis is a complete nonissue for them , and the bond markets so far seem to agree .
All 50 states have investment - grade credit ratings , with California the lowest , and even California is still considered “ average , ” according to Moody ’s Investors Service .
The last state that defaulted on its bonds , Arkansas , did so during the Great Depression .
Goldman Sachs , in a research report last week , acknowledged the pension issue but concluded the states were very unlikely to default on their debt and noted the states had 30 years to close pension shortfalls .
Even though about $ 5 billion of municipal bonds are in default today , the vast majority were issued by small local authorities in boom - and - bust locations like Florida , said Matt Fabian , managing director of Municipal Market Advisors , an independent consulting firm .
The issuers raised money to pay for projects like sewer connections and new roads in subdivisions that collapsed in the subprime mortgage disaster .
The states , he said , are different .
They learned a lesson from New York City , which got into trouble in the 1970s by financing its operations with short - term debt that had to be rolled over again and again .
When investors suddenly lost confidence , New York was left empty - handed .
To keep that from happening again , Mr. Fabian said , most states require short - term debt to be fully repaid the same year it is issued .
Some states have taken even more forceful measures to build creditor confidence .
New York State has a trustee that intercepts tax revenues and makes some bond payments before the state can get to the money .
California has a “ continuous appropriation ” for debt payments , so bondholders know they will get their interest even when the budget is hamstrung .
The states can also take refuge in America ’s federalist system .
Thus , if California were to get into hot water , it could seek assistance in Washington , and probably come away with some funds .
Already , the federal government is spending hundreds of millions helping the states issue their bonds .
Professor Rogoff , who has spent most of his career studying global debt crises , has combed through several centuries ’ worth of records with a fellow economist , Carmen M. Reinhart of the University of Maryland , looking for signs that a country was about to default .
It is often said that figuring out women is close to impossible .
All their signs are obvious but yet again unbelievably faint .
So , how do you know if she 's into you ?
Here are a few signs to tell if that girl who melts your heart feels the same way about you ...
1 . Nothing is more important than you -
She responds to your texts , Whatsapps messages , tweets , social - networking chats and emails in less than an hour .
Your phone calls are never ignored without a long sorry message .
2 . She repeats the phrase " Someone like you " - Either her description of Mr. Perfect is someone very similar to you or she just admits that she wants " someone like you " over and over again .
3 . Her friends are now your friends -
If a girl likes you , her friends know .
Hence they try to add you on your social - networking page or meet you , but none of her girlfriends are ever allowed to carry on a conversation with you for more than five minutes .
4 . She is always one step too close -
Whether you 're sitting at a restaurant or you 're walking on the streets , she is always that one step too close with her hands brushing yours .
5 . She is there for you no matter what - Does n't matter if it 's mid day or midnight , sober or drunk , if you call , she will answer and talk .
She may have to sleep to look fresh for the biggest moment of her life tomorrow , but she 'd rather be talking to you .
6 Your ex-girlfriends are her best and worst topics -
She wants to know everything about your ex-girlfriend so she can determine what you like and do n't .
But she also tells you why you 're so much better off without them and picks on them constantly .
7 . Everything about you is a big deal -
Be it your birthday , your parents ' wedding anniversary or even a promotion at work , she is overjoyed for you .
She always lets you know how your happiness makes her happy .
8 . She always has a smile for you -
When you 're having an awfully bad day , she will do everything she can to make you smile .
She will not rest until she knows you 're OK .
9 . She makes sure everything is perfect -
If you make plans to meet , she re-confirms thrice because she wants to know for sure you 'll be there .
When she shows up five minutes early , she 'll be dressed to perfection .
Even if you 're meeting her at 2 in the morning , she 'll make an effort to look good for you .
10 .
She has her jealous moment
- If you tell her about this girl you believe is pretty , you will find an obvious change in her tone .
She will then proceed to give you an hour 's lecture about anything and everything she can find wrong in that girl .
11 . Every word you utter matters

Hundreds of breaches of parliamentary rules by MPs who accepted free overseas trips from foreign governments have been uncovered by a BBC investigation .
More than 20 MPs broke rules on declaring hospitality in questions or debates after visiting locations such as the Maldives , Cyprus and Gibraltar .
The MPs - from Labour , the Tories and the Lib Dems - breached parliamentary regulations on more than 400 occasions .
One former standards watchdog says it shows MPs cannot regulate themselves .
Some MPs dismissed the breaches as technical errors or oversights .
However , the former Commissioner for Standards in Public Life , Sir Alistair Graham , told the BBC repeated rule breaches threatened to " undermine the integrity " of the democratic system .
He said it " demonstrated the failure of the self - regulating system " , adding : " This is a very worrying situation which will further demean the standing of Parliament . "
DECLARING FOREIGN TRIPS
Any MP who has an overseas trip paid for by a foreign government must register it within four weeks
They must declare a financial interest if it " might reasonably be thought by others to influence the speech , representation or communication in question "
This includes when tabling questions , motions , bills or amendments , and when speaking out during Commons proceedings Members may not , for example , call for increased UK financial assistance to the government which provided the hospitality
Q&A - MPs ' foreign trips rules
Send us your comments
Conservative leader David Cameron said : " The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner must get to the bottom of what 's happened in every case and we must look at the penalties that apply when rules like this are broken . "
He said the self - regulating system was " at the heart of the problem " and that it might be necessary to change its structure .
Mr Cameron added that a system of imposing automatic fixed penalties on MPs who break rules might be appropriate .
The rules on overseas visits are there to ensure that no - one can accuse MPs of accepting foreign hospitality in return for political favours , for example pressing the UK government for financial assistance .
They require MPs to register such visits and then declare relevant trips in questions , motions or debates .
One of those who appears to have fallen foul of the code of conduct is Labour 's Andrew Dismore , a member of the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee - the very body which polices MPs ' behaviour .
He broke rules more than 90 times , following annual visits to Cyprus , by failing to declare the hospitality when raising issues about the island in Parliament .
In total , he has tabled more than 200 Commons questions about Cyprus since the last election in 2005 , on topics such as missing persons from the island and its victims of past conflict between Turkey and Greece .
Politicians from all three main parties have breached rules
The Commons information office estimates it costs on average £ 149 to answer a written question .
Mr Dismore has also signed motions and led debates about Cyprus .
However , he denies any wrongdoing and claims his questions about Cyprus were not sufficiently relevant to his trips to require a declaration .
Conservative David Amess has admitted failing to register a free trip to the Maldives - regarded as a " very serious " breach of the rules by the Committee on Standards and Privileges , according to the MPs ' code of conduct .
He also accepts he did not register a second trip for almost a year , blaming an administrative error by his office staff .
' Paradise '
During a debate he tabled about the Maldives in 2007 , Mr Amess told the Commons how his " splendid visit " had given him " an early taste of paradise " .
" No words can describe adequately just how beautiful the islands are , " he added , before suggesting the UK Government " could be encouraged to do a little more than is being done at the moment " for the islands in the Indian Ocean .
Despite leading two debates about UK support for the Maldives and asking 15 questions about the islands , he failed to declare an interest .
Referring to the MPs ' code of conduct , Mr Amess told the BBC : " It is for the member to judge whether a financial interest is sufficiently relevant . "
Liberal Democrat Norman Baker , who has been actively calling for a clean - up of Parliament following the expenses scandal , has admitted breaching the rules on 37 occasions .
MARK EASTON'S UK
What really struck me as I conducted the investigation is that the system of scrutiny surrounding the rules clearly does not work
Mark Easton

Read Mark 's thoughts in full
In a statement to the BBC , Mr Baker accepts he failed to declare an interest when leading debates and tabling questions about topics such as human rights in Tibet .
He has travelled to India twice , courtesy of the Tibet Society and the Tibet government - in - exile .
" I should have then declared a relevant interest in respect of the parliamentary activities you list , " he said .
" It is an unintended oversight that I did not . "
The MP who heads the Commons Public Administration Select Committee , Tony Wright , told the BBC that such rule - breaking was " unacceptable " and that the system should be more transparent .
" Declarations should be the norm .
It is quite proper for MPs to go on visits .
Some of those visits will be financed by foreign governments .
But ... if they 're lobbying on behalf of governments who have paid for their visits , then clearly we need to know about it . "
The rules are enforced by MPs themselves .
Breaches are only investigated if a formal complaint is made and there is no independent body to ensure that members stick to the regulations .
Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox has admitted breaking the rules on two occasions , having visited Sri Lanka five times in the past three years courtesy of its government .
He failed to declare the hospitality when asking ministers how much UK aid had been given to Sri Lanka .
In a statement , Mr Fox said : " I should have noted an interest and will be writing to the registrar to make this clear . "
He blamed a " changeover of staffing responsibilities " for registering one of his visits more than two months late .
During the current Parliament , Gibraltar 's government has funded 31 trips for MPs to attend an annual street party on the territory .
Street party
Labour 's Lindsay Hoyle has been a guest at these National Day Celebrations three times .
Following his visits he has asked 30 questions , tabled three early day motions and signed a further seven , all without declaring his interest .
Mr Hoyle also broke the rules by failing to declare an interest following registered trips to the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands .
" I have never received or sought any financial benefit , " he told the BBC .
Conservative Andrew Rosindell has been a guest of Gibraltar 's government twice in recent years .
He subsequently asked 48 questions and signed or sponsored nine motions related to the territory without declaring an interest .
Thirteen of his questions about Gibraltar were before a visit had been registered .
The BBC put the matters to Mr Rosindell but has yet to receive a response .
The BBC has identified a further 10 MPs from all three major parties who have been guests of Gibraltar 's government and shortly afterwards breached rules when signing motions or tabling questions about the territory .
The investigation has also identified three more Labour MPs and another Conservative who failed to declare an interest following visits to Cyprus .

When the government passed the Right to Information Act ( RTI ) in 2005 , it may well have added a statutory warning : exercising this right may be extremely injurious to health .
Shashidhar Mishra of Begusarai , who was murdered by unknown assailants last Sunday , is the second RTI activist to be killed in a month for perhaps knowing too much .
Attacks on RTI activists have emerged as a disturbing trend of late , especially in light of the murder of noted Pune RTI activist Satish Shetty , who was responsible for unearthing many land scams in Maharashtra .
Mr. Mishra , a local RTI activist who worked tirelessly to expose corruption at the panchayat and block levels , was shot dead by unidentified men on motorcycles near his residence in Phulwaria village on the night of February 14 .
Village sources revealed that Mr. Mishra , who had acquired the sobriquet of ‘ Khabri Lal , ’ had been proactively using the RTI as a tool for exposing scams .
“ He incurred the wrath of some local body representatives in the process , ” a villager disclosed .
Begusarai Superintendent of Police Vinay Kumar said that different angles to Mr. Mishra ’s killing , including past enmity with certain people , were being investigated .
“ An FIR has been lodged against three people , though we have not made any vital breakthrough in the case as of now , ” Mr. Kumar said .
Mr. Mishra ’s death has drawn fire from activists of the National Campaign for the People ’s Right to Information ( NCPRI ) and the Bihar RTI Manch , who have challenged the government ’s commitment on the protection of whistleblowers .
The RTI Act has been sailing in rough seas for some time now in Bihar , with the State government ’s decision to make certain changes in the legislation citing “ procedural inconveniences ” drawing sharp criticism from activists and NGOs .
“ Cases pertaining to harassment of applicants were being closed summarily without imposing penalty to the guilty officers , ” said Parveen Amanullah , convener of the RTI Manch .
As per the Act , any officer refusing to part with information is penalised Rs.250 per day from his salary .
“ The government has only dealt with 22 such cases so far , when there are several officers who have gotten away scot free , ” Ms. Amanullah added .
In November , activists strongly objected to the Bihar cabinet ’s decision which made it mandatory for Below the Poverty Line ( BPL ) applicants to pay money at the rate of Rs.2 per page for information exceeding 10 pages .
“ Information for BPL applicants is supposed to be completely free as stipulated by section 7 ( 5 ) of the Act .
The move is contrary to the spirit of the Act , ” Ms. Amanullah said .
According to noted activist and Magsaysay Award winner Sandeep Pandey , the Bihar government ’s move only serves to obscure the truth .
“ More importantly , the government has not substantiated with any data as to how questions asked by these BPL cardholders was causing them inconvenience .
It is definitely anti-poor , ” Mr. Pandey added .
He said that while changes in the RTI Act have been enacted in other States like Uttar Pradesh , which had recently taken the civil aviation department off its disclosure list , the “ modified legislation had not directly affected the common people in a big way . ”
I like the lighting you used to reflect the emotion , and that you did n't reveal the cause of the emotion until the end .
I also like that you used the transitions in the song as transitions between scenes , very appropriate .
Man , policy - making is easy if you 're a Republican .
You just ignore reality .
Appearing on Fox News 's " On the Record with Greta Van Sustren " last night , Pawlenty said the federal law that mandates ER treatment should be repealed .
" Well , for one thing you could do is change the federal law so that not every ER is required to treat everybody who comes in the door , even if they have a minor condition , " Pawlenty said .
" They should be -- if you have a minor condition , instead of being at the really expensive ER , you should be at the primary care clinic . "
For the record , federal law actually only requires ERs to provide treatment except for in real medical emergencies .
They already can turn you away for minor conditions .
So not only does Pawlenty not understand the real healthcare system crisis , he does n't even understand current law .
Yeah , he 's pretty much right up there with Sarah Palin as presidential material .
New York State legislators defend the War Emergency Tenant Protection Act — also known as rent control — as a way of protecting tenants from war - related housing shortages .
The war referred to in the law is not the 2003 war in Iraq , however , or the Vietnam War ; it is World War II .
That is when rent control started in New York City .
Of course , war has very little to do with apartment shortages .
On the contrary , the shortage is created by rent control , the supposed solution .
Gotham is far from the only city to have embraced rent control .
Many others across the United States have succumbed to the blandishments of this legislative “ fix . ”
Rent control , like all other government - mandated price controls , is a law placing a maximum price , or a “ rent ceiling , ” on what landlords may charge tenants .
If it is to have any effect , the rent level must be set at a rate below that which would otherwise have prevailed .
( An enactment prohibiting apartment rents from exceeding , say , $ 100,000 per month would have no effect since no one would pay that amount in any case . )
But if rents are established at less than their equilibrium levels , the quantity demanded will necessarily exceed the amount supplied , and rent control will lead to a shortage of dwelling spaces .
In a competitive market and absent controls on prices , if the amount of a commodity or service demanded is larger than the amount supplied , prices rise to eliminate the shortage ( by both bringing forth new supply and by reducing the amount demanded ) .
But controls prevent rents from attaining market - clearing levels and shortages result .
With shortages in the controlled sector , this excess demand spills over onto the noncontrolled sector ( typically , new upper - bracket rental units or condominiums ) .
But this noncontrolled segment of the market is likely to be smaller than it would be without controls because property owners fear that controls may one day be placed on them .
The high demand in the noncontrolled segment along with the small quantity supplied , both caused by rent control , boost prices in that segment .
Paradoxically , then , even though rents may be lower in the controlled sector , they rise greatly for uncontrolled units and may be higher for rental housing as a whole .
As in the case of other price ceilings , rent control causes shortages , diminution in the quality of the product , and queues .
But rent control differs from other such schemes .
With price controls on gasoline , the waiting lines worked on a first - come - first - served basis .
With rent control , because the law places sitting tenants first in the queue , many of them benefit .
The Effects of Rent Control
Economists are virtually unanimous in concluding that rent controls are destructive .
In a 1990 poll of 464 economists published in the May 1992 issue of the American Economic Review , 93 percent of U.S. respondents agreed , either completely or with provisos , that “ a ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available . ”
Similarly , another study reported that more than 95 percent of the Canadian economists polled agreed with the statement .
The agreement cuts across the usual political spectrum , ranging all the way from Nobel Prize winners milton friedman and friedrich hayek on the “ right ” to their fellow Nobel laureate gunnar myrdal , an important architect of the Swedish Labor Party ’s welfare state , on the “ left . ”
Myrdal stated , “ Rent control has in certain Western countries constituted , maybe , the worst example of poor planning by governments lacking courage and vision . ”
His fellow Swedish economist ( and socialist ) Assar Lindbeck asserted , “ In many cases rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city — except for bombing . ”
That cities like New York have clearly not been destroyed by rent control is due to the fact that rent control has been relaxed over the years .
Rent stabilization , for example , which took the place of rent control for newer buildings , is less restrictive than the old rent control .
Also , the decades - long boom in the New York City housing market is not in rent - controlled or rent - stabilized units , but in condominiums and cooperative housing .
But these two forms of housing ownership grew important as a way of getting around rent control .
Economists have shown that rent control diverts new investment , which would otherwise have gone to rental housing , toward greener pastures — greener in terms of consumer need .
They have demonstrated that it leads to housing deterioration , fewer repairs , and less maintenance .
For example , Paul Niebanck found that 29 percent of rent - controlled housing in the United States was deteriorated , but only 8 percent of the uncontrolled units were in such a state of disrepair .
Joel Brenner and Herbert Franklin cited similar statistics for England and France .
The economic reasons are straightforward .
One effect of government oversight is to retard investment in residential rental units .
Imagine that you have five million dollars to invest and can place the funds in any industry you wish .
In most businesses , governments will place only limited controls and taxes on your enterprise .
But if you entrust your money to rental housing , you must pass one additional hurdle : the rent - control authority , with its hearings , red tape , and rent ceilings .
Under these conditions is it any wonder that you are less likely to build or purchase rental housing ?
This line of reasoning holds not just for you , but for everyone else as well .
As a result , the quantity of apartments for rent will be far smaller than otherwise .
And not so amazingly , the preceding analysis holds true not only for the case where rent controls are in place , but even where they are only threatened .
The mere anticipation of controls is enough to have a chilling effect on such investment .
Instead , everything else under the sun in the real estate market has been built : condominiums , office towers , hotels , warehouses , commercial space .
Why ?
Because such investments have never been subject to rent controls , and no one fears that they ever will be .
It is no accident that these facilities boast healthy vacancy rates and relatively slowly increasing rental rates , while residential space suffers from a virtual zero vacancy rate in the controlled sector and skyrocketing prices in the uncontrolled sector .
Although many rent - control ordinances specifically exempt new rental units from coverage , investors are too cautious ( perhaps too smart ) to put their faith in rental housing .
In numerous cases housing units supposedly exempt forever from controls were nevertheless brought under the provisions of this law due to some “ emergency ” or other .
New York City ’s government , for example , has three times broken its promise to exempt new or vacant units from control .
So prevalent is this practice of rent - control authorities that a new term has been invented to describe it : “ recapture . ”
Rent control has destroyed entire sections of sound housing in New York ’s South Bronx and has led to decay and abandonment throughout the entire five boroughs of the city .
Although hard statistics on abandonments are not available , William Tucker estimates that about 30,000 New York apartments were abandoned annually from 1972 to 1982 , a loss of almost a third of a million units in this eleven - year period .
Thanks to rent control , and to potential investors ’ all - too - rational fear that rent control will become even more stringent , no sensible investor will build rental housing unsubsidized by government .
Effects on Tenants
Existing rental units fare poorly under rent control .
Even with the best will in the world , the landlord sometimes cannot afford to pay his escalating fuel , labor , and materials bills , to say nothing of refinancing his mortgage , out of the rent increase he can legally charge .
And under rent controls he lacks the best will ; the incentive he had under free - market conditions to supply tenant services is severely reduced .
The sitting tenant is “ protected ” by rent control but , in many cases , receives no real rental bargain because of improper maintenance , poor repairs and painting , and grudging provision of services .
The enjoyment he can derive out of his dwelling space ultimately tends to be reduced to a level commensurate with his controlled rent .
This may take decades , though , and meanwhile he benefits from rent control .
In fact , many tenants , usually rich or middle - class ones who are politically connected or who were lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time , can gain a lot from rent control .
Tenants in some of the nicest neighborhoods in New York City pay a scandalously small fraction of the market price of their apartments .
In the early 1980s , for example , former mayor Ed Koch paid $ 441.49 for an apartment then worth about $ 1,200.00 per month .
Some people in this fortunate position use their apartments like hotel rooms , visiting only a few times per year .
Then there is the “ old lady effect . ”
Consider the case of a two - parent , four - child family that has occupied a ten - room rental dwelling .
One by one the children grow up , marry , and move elsewhere .
The husband dies .
Now the lady is left with a gigantic apartment .
She uses only two or three of the rooms and , to save on heating and cleaning , closes off the remainder .
Without rent control she would move to a smaller accommodation .
But rent control makes that option unattractive .
Needless to say , these practices further exacerbate the housing crisis .
Repeal of rent control would free up thousands of such rooms very quickly , dampening the impetus toward vastly higher rents .
What determines whether or not a tenant benefits from rent control ?
If the building in which he lives is in a good neighborhood where rents would rise appreciably if rent control were repealed , then the landlord has an incentive to maintain the building against the prospect of that happy day .
This incentive is enhanced if there are many decontrolled units in the building ( due to “ vacancy decontrol ” when tenants move out ) or privately owned condominiums for which the landlord must provide adequate services .
Then the tenant who pays the scandalously low rent may “ free ride ” on his neighbors .
But in the more typical case the quality of housing services tends to reflect rental payments .
This , at least , is the situation that will prevail at equilibrium .
If government really had the best interests of tenants at heart and was for some reason determined to employ controls , it would do the very opposite of imposing rent restrictions : it would instead control the price of every other good and service available , apart from residential suites , in an attempt to divert resources out of all those other opportunities and into this one field .
But that , of course , would bring about full - scale socialism , the very system under which the Eastern Europeans suffered so grimly .
If the government wanted to help the poor and was for some reason constrained to keep rent controls , it would do better to tightly control rents on luxury unit rentals and to eliminate rent controls on more modest dwellings — the very opposite of the present practice .
Then , builders ’ incentives would be turned around .
Instead of erecting luxury dwellings , which are now exempt , they would be led , “ as if by an invisible hand , ” to create housing for the poor and middle classes .
Solutions
The negative consequences of rent legislation have become so massive and perverse that even many of its former supporters have spoken out against it .
Instead of urging a quick termination of controls , however , some pundits would only allow landlords to buy tenants out of their controlled dwellings .
That they propose such a solution is understandable .
Because tenants outnumber landlords and are usually convinced that rent control is in their best interests , they are likely to invest considerable political energy ( see Rent Seeking ) in maintaining rent control .
Having landlords “ buy off ” these opponents of reform , therefore , could be a politically effective way to end rent control .
But making property owners pay to escape a law that has victimized many of them for years is not an effective way to make them confident that rent controls will be absent in the future .
The surest way to encourage private investment is to signal investors that housing will be safe from rent control .
And the most effective way to do that is to eliminate the possibility of rent control with an amendment to the state constitution that forbids it .
Paradoxically , one of the best ways to help tenants is to protect the economic freedom of landlords .
Rent Control : It ’s Worse Than Bombing new delhi—A “ romantic conception of socialism ” … destroyed Vietnam ’s economy in the years after the Vietnam war , Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said Friday .
Addressing a crowded news conference in the Indian capital , Mr. Thach admitted that controls … had artificially encouraged demand and discouraged supply … .
House rents had … been kept low … so all the houses in Hanoi had fallen into disrepair , said Mr. Thach .
“ The Americans could n’t destroy Hanoi , but we have destroyed our city by very low rents .
We realized it was stupid and that we must change policy , ” he said .
