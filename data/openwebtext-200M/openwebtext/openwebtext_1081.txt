Who we are is never , ever a one - dimensional painting .
It is a sculpture , kinetic , a maze , a faceted crystal , a subterranean cavern , an oceanic abyss , a windswept plateau , all of these things .
Having a dawning realization that you might resonate with something about BDSM , whether it not it is something as simple as fascination with the lines of a corset or the sensation of helplessness does n’t necessarily relegate yourself to the realm of porn- addicted drooling cackling pervert .
It takes WORK to achieve that level of depravity !
I understand the concern that this might be a slippery slope for some .
That your desire to submit to or your need to overpower someone will eventually overpower or sublimate your sense of self .
It does n’t have to .
It really only has to be that if that is what you chose .
Most people do not talk about their sexual habits in public .
Many do not because they feel it is “ personal ” which I understand , and celebrate .
Some do not because they feel it is “ shameful , ” which I understand but think is more the pity .
Some people DO discuss their intimate issues , because they wish to celebrate that part of themselves .
It is a matter of choice and circumstance .
Obviously I am very open about who I am within and without the BDSM community .
I am very transparent about my selves as performer , writer , actor , teacher , presenter , pervert .
But I do it because it challenges me every day , and because I feel compelled to , and because , dammit , someone SHOULD be out there , so that other people can feel less alone and adrift .
If my sharing about my darkest kink can lead someone to think “ Hey , I feel that way too , and I ’m OK . ”
Then I am satisfied .
SO ..now you are learning about yourself that you might have desires that take you in to a lovely sexual meandering oxbow on the river of life .
It is my prayer that this is something from which you draw strength .
Not shame .
Not horror .
Not repulsion .
But joy , excitement , pleasure .
You do n’t even have to be all of one thing all of the time .
What you and your partner choose to do is your choice .
You do n’t have to formalize it with contracts and you do n’t have to spend hundreds of dollars on airfare and stilettos and floggers to go party in a ballroom full of swinging bodies and cracking whips .
Just be YOU .
For every pervert on ( bondage / ALT / collarme / fetlife ) .com and the rest , there are thousands of people who just happen to find themselves behaving very obediently towards their partners .
Millions of people who orgasm just a little bit harder when their partner bites them during sex .
Remember , NOT EVERYONE IS AN EXHBITIONIST !
If you do NOT have joy added to your play by the presence of other people watching or playing along side you , then of COURSE you would n’t want to participate publicly !
The public scene is built around exhibitionists .
You do n’t have to immerse yourself in that .
You can be shy , remain private , and be kinky .
You can simply investigate , learn , level - set , and take your newfound sexuality back to your own private Idaho .
If privacy and intimacy is what you need , what you crave , believe me when I say you can find that .
I have had it .
I ’ve had relationships … good ones … with people who did n’t identify with the public BDSM community at all .
The first encounter I had with someone who made me questions my sexuality had nothing to do with dungeons and dominance .
And my last solid relationship was with a guy who wanted nothing to do with the BDSM community , but felt at ease with me serving him , and would do things to me in the privacy of our bedroom that , to this day , constitute some of the hottest memories I hold .
You do n’t have to walk in my shoes to be the type of kinky human you want to be .
Just be you .
And your counterpart will open up to you in the same way you open up to them .
Markos commissioned a national poll to ascertain just how many people out there are suckering for the right 's " Birther " conspiracy theories .
For the country as a whole , it looks good :

But when we look at Republicans alone , it looks pretty grim :

In other words , nearly a third of them believe the Birthers outright , and another third of them think " they may have a point there , Vern . "

The Earth , which orbits the sun once a year .
Science enjoys the best and the worst of times today , celebrated as the secret sauce behind economic growth , but embattled in high - profile areas such as climate change , stem cells and evolution .
" Science is more essential for our prosperity , our security , our health , our environment , and our quality of life than it has ever been before , " said President Obama , in April at the National Academy of Sciences .
At the same time , Obama noted , federal funding of physics and related sciences has fallen by nearly half since the 1980's , U.S. schools trail in math and science versus Japan , England , South Korea and others .
" And we have watched as scientific integrity has been undermined and scientific research politicized in an effort to advance predetermined ideological agendas , " he said .
In Unscientific America : How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens Our Future ( Basic Books , $ 24 ) , Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum size up the paradox of American science and offer their solution to its ills .
Leaving aside hand - wringing over public ignorance of scientific fun facts ( only half of people in a National Science Foundation survey knew the Earth circles the sun once every year , for example ) , the two authors point to the " most important " kind of scientific illiteracy , " citizen 's awareness of the importance of science to politics , policy , and our collective future . "
What the country needs , they believe , are the kinds of communicators who can make science comprehensible and popular at the same time .
The book focuses on the late Carl Sagan , whose 1992 rejection from membership in the National Academy of Sciences , they write , " made clear ( scientists ) view of popularizers in their ranks , and of public outreach generally . "
They argue that the science establishment needs a new career path for science communicators ( folks like Kirshenbaum , a marine scientist at Duke , who previously interned in the office of Sen.
Bill Nelson , D- Fla. , and who once worked as a disc jockey . )
" We 're not saying every scientist needs to become another Carl Sagan , " Kirshenbaum says .
Or Comedy Central regular , astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson .
But scientists need to open paths " jobs , positions , and incentives , " for their brethren to communicate the role science plays in modern life , the books argues .
" I think that they get points for pointing to a serious problem , " says political scientist Jon Miller of Michigan State University in East Lansing , who has a review of the book coming out in the Nov. - Dec. American Scientist .
But Miller disagrees with Unscientific America 's prescription for treating U.S. disengagement with science .
" You can't ignore the role of education The book 's suggestion to breed more science experts , while well - intended , dismisses the need to get science information , including basic facts , into high school classes , Miller says .
" No one should graduate from high school without knowing what a molecule is , " he says .
That 's because your odds of understanding other science concepts , for example , nanotechnology , the manipulation of materials on the molecular scale , increase greatly — from nearly zero to two - thirds — once you understand that a molecule is a chemical combination of atoms .
" You can't fix this problem without fixing public schools . "
Further , Miller says a better - educated electorate , " should be our goal in a modern democracy , " instead of well - connected experts winning arguments through their authority .
" Should n't scientists just let the evidence speak for itself , " , asks Stewart Justman of the University of Montana in Missoula .
Justman , author of Do No Harm : How a Magic Bullet for Prostate Cancer Became a Medical Quandary , suggests that grooming authority figures is n't the solution for curing science illiteracy .
" I do n't see a big difference between a popularizer and a crusader , " Justman says .
" And that is not how it is supposed to work in science . "

A soak in a steamy tub , surrounded by candles sure seems like a great way to unwind .
But new research suggests that burning certain kinds of candles may generate indoor air pollutants .
Frequently lighting many candles in an unventilated space could lead to problems , say the study researchers .
Researchers at South Carolina State University studied petroleum - based and vegetable - source candles to determine their emissions .
They let candles from different manufacturers burn for up to six hours in a small box ( 8 inches x 8 inches x 26 inches ) , and then collected and analyzed substances released into the air .
They found that paraffin - based candles -- the most popular kind -- emitted toxic chemicals like toluene and benzene .
Soybean candles did not , according to the study , which was presented this week at the American Chemical Society meeting in Washington , D.C. Candles made of beeswax or soybean tend to make mention of that ingredient on their label ; paraffin candles may not .
The researchers say that lighting a paraffin candle once in a while is unlikely to pose a health threat .
However , frequently lighting many candles in an unventilated space could lead to problems , and may aggravate asthma , cause allergy - like symptoms , or irritate the respiratory tract .

However , whether some candles are safer than others is still debatable , according to one expert .
" I think there 's some controversy out there as to which candles are better than others , " says George Thurston , Ph.D. , an associate professor of environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine .
Thurston urges people to be prudent about lighting any kind of candle -- whether it 's paraffin , beeswax , or soybean -- in an enclosed space .
" Just lighting a match to start a candle creates sulfur pollution in the air , " he adds .
" It 's one of the big sources of sulfur in the indoor environment , so using a lighter would probably be cleaner . "

While you are n't putting your life on the line by lighting a candle , he says you should exercise at least some caution .
" You ought to try to minimize your exposure to paraffin wax candles , " says Thurston .
" And when you light any kind of candle , you might turn on the exhaust fan ; even if it ruins the mood , it vents out the fumes .
People just need to use common sense . "
Candles are only one potential source of indoor air pollution .
" A lot of household products give off volatile organic compounds , or VOCs , " says David Rosenstreich , M.D. , the director of the division of allergy and immunology at New York 's Montefiore Medical Center .
Cleaning products , hair sprays , and mousses all contribute to indoor air pollution .
" We live in a highly chemically infused environment where people use tons of products , " he adds .
" Just because it's on the supermarket shelves does n't mean it 's safe . "
Central heating and cooling systems , as well as gas fireplaces , can generate indoor air pollution too .
" People have these fake fireplaces that are unventilated and the pollution just sits in the room , " says Thurston .
" You need ventilation , just like you do with candles . "

People with respiratory problems such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should make an extra effort to cut down on indoor air pollution , says Rosenstreich .
And it 's easier than it sounds .
" You can wipe down your counter with a little soap and water , " he says .
" You do n't need to use these powerful cleaners . "
He also suggests ventilating your home as naturally as possible by opening the windows at night once the house has cooled down .
" That way you 're not breathing in the same old stale air , " he says .
If you are prone to outdoor allergies , use a filter in your central air and heating systems to cut down on dust .
Simply thinking twice about the chemical products you use in your home can go a long way toward improving air quality .
" A lot of things we take for granted are n't really safe at all , " Rosenstreich says .
Barbara Miller , a spokesperson for the National Candle Association , says " no candle wax has ever been shown to be dangerous or harmful to human health . "
" Paraffin wax is neither toxic nor carcinogenic , " says Miller .
" All types of properly formulated candle wax have been shown to burn cleanly and safely . "

She notes that a 2007 industry - funded study found that none of the candle waxes tested -- including paraffin , soy wax , and beeswax -- produced benzene .
The levels of volatile organic compounds were less than 2 percent of the indoor air - quality standard .
In that study , nine 6 - ounce candles of each type containing no fragrance or dyes were burned simultaneously in a test chamber .
The test simulated four hours of daily burning of one container candle in a room about 1765 cubic feet ( 50 cubic meters ) in size .

Over the past couple of months , after merging Search Engine Journal and Search & Social , my business life as an SEO and online marketing consultant has changed a bit from the behind the scenes copy , coding and linking world , to add a bit more bizdev , management and of course , travel – which means I ’ll probably be blogging on the business aspects of running a search agency more and more on SEJ .
After a week of four flights and various locations around the US , and even Russia last month , I ’ve found that there are some very important essentials to making business travel easier and keeping on top of day to day initiatives a bit more tolerable .
The most time spent in business travel is usually either offline ( in the airplane or taxi ) or in inconvenient locations ; such as waiting at airport gates or hotel rooms with limited wifi - which means laptop usage is not always a reality .

Business Magazines
Unlike a good amount of business travelers , I tend to enjoy my unwired time in the airplane , and enjoy reading magazines about business management , which may not be about search , but always seem to give me some inspiration to apply to Search & Social in terms of staffing , traditional marketing , productivity and smart investments .
Furthermore , after 7 years of blogging , my attention span does not allow for reading an entire business book , so I enjoy magazine format .
The two magazines I always make it a point to pick up are Inc. and Entrepreneuer .
Recently Inc. has been reviewing different start up and funding projects like Ycombinator which I found very relevant to our company currently growing and expanding our offices .
Furthermore , Entrepreneur just ran an awesome piece on Patron tequila , which was started 20 years ago by John Paul Dejoria , who is also the entrepreneur who started Paul Mitchell hair products with $ 700 when he was homeless and living in his car .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
For the first time , more than 34 million Americans received food stamps in May , the government said on Thursday , another symptom of the longest and one of the deepest recessions since the Great Depression .
Enrollment surged by 2 percent to reach a record 34.4 million people , or one in nine Americans , in the latest month for which figures are available .
It was the sixth month in a row that enrollment set a record .
Every state recorded a gain , and Florida had the largest increase at 4.2 percent .
Enrollment for food stamps , which help people buy groceries , is highest during times of economic stress .
The U.S. unemployment rate of 9.5 percent is the highest in 26 years .
“ Food stamp enrollment is rising because the economy is having a devastating impact on low - income families and they need this program to eat , ” said Stacy Dean of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a think tank .
“ Every single state has been affected . ”
The average benefit in May was $ 133.65 per person .
The economic stimulus package enacted earlier this year included a temporary increase in food stamp benefits of $ 80 a month for a family of four .
The federal stimulus legislation will block a potential $ 5 a month decline in benefits in fiscal 2010 which would have been triggered by moderating food prices , the Agriculture Department said .

WITH the approval of 80 % of its voters , Oakland last month became the first city in America to exact a sales tax on cannabis .
Los Angeles , San Francisco and other Californian cities may follow along .
It is a sign of harsh budgetary times .
Although Californians have been allowed since 1996 to buy cannabis for medicinal purposes , only a state sales tax was later added to their purchase , not a local one too .
Now , at any rate in Oakland , consumers will have to pay both .
Cannabis sellers claim to be pleased .
“ We completely support the taxes .
It 's one step closer to legitimising the business , ” says Richard Lee , a local retailer .
And , indeed , the case for buying the stuff without a doctor 's prescription is gaining ground .
Barack Obama has said that the federal government would not interfere with a state 's right to regulate the drug .
This opened the door for Tom Ammiano , a Californian assemblyman , to introduce a bill earlier this year that would legalise the cultivation of marijuana and its distribution and sale to people over 21 .
The California Board of Equalisation , the state 's revenue agency , calculates that if Mr Ammiano 's bill gets through , the tax receipts could be almost $ 1.4 billion a year .
On top of that , say supporters , there would be lots of cannabis - driven tourism .
There is another side to it , of course .
A study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that among those seeking treatment for drug and alcohol addiction , the number of cannabis addicts rose from 12 % in 1997 to 16 % in 2007 .
The rise is blamed in part on the weed being more potent than it used to be .
The National Institute on Drug Abuse says it is up to five times stronger than it was in the 1970s .
But , compared with other drugs , cannabis is still relatively benign — and the thought of that extra tax revenue tempts hard - up California .
Nothing beat ’s the feeling of getting a new SEO tool .
It ’s the same kind of feeling you had as a child when you were unwrapping Christmas presents under the tree .
The shiny new features , set to make your life just that little bit easier or maybe I am just a bit of a geek !!!.
I do n’t use too many tools .
I try and concentrate on a few and work them into a defined strategy .
There are so many great free plugins for mozilla that you can do a lot without forking over lots of cash .
I do have a copy of Market Samurai , which I love .
I recently started using SEO SpyGlass after trialing it for over a month .
One thing you need in the SEO game is some good competitive analysis tools and both of these deliver .
Why do you need this , well remember in SEO Strategies that fail I mentioned being a greedy f*cking pig .
You need to get your head around link analysis and link building .
Now SEO
Spyglass is a nice little tool so I am by no means going to start dissing it .
I do however find it ’s SEO blueprint reports pretty interesting .
Under their exact steps to increase PR , step 3 is :
3 . Buy links .
This is the fastest way , but of course there ’s a price to pay .
Just email the site ’s webmaster and ask how much it would cost to get a link .
Most of them will be happy to sell you a link for as little as $ 30 - 40 a month .

That ’s how to stick it to Matt Cutts , just recommend it in your reports to all users .
Not only is it recommended but it ’s the “ fastest ” way and get this , most webmasters are happy to sell links .
F*cking sweet , why do I even bother using the tool for links analysis , I am just going to bang out a load of mails asking to buy links …
Ok to back up a little on this .
I really do n’t care if SEO Spyglass recommend buying links .
I am not one of those people who shudder at the idea of this going on .
I have seen countless sites ranking top of Google with a lot of spammy links Google say ’s it does n’t count and can detect .
Let ’s look at the recommendations made by SEO Spyglass :
Note : I know a lot of twitter people get bored this far into a post , if you are one of those , go ahead and just RT it now , ya know you want to RETWEET THE SHIZNET OUT OF THIS
Build Me Some Freaking Links – 3 Steps
1. Swap Links : AAAhhhhh the old wink , wink ….. nudge , nudge of linking .
I ’ll give you one if you give me one .
You will probably find about 70 % of your competitors links are garbage and are of no use .
This form of linking can be pretty tedious and does n’t yield great results .
I am sure the common perception of link exchanging is going to die out in the next couple of years .
I whole heartily agree with doing competitive analysis on your competitor and looking for opportunities to nick his / her best links .
But sending begging letter after begging letter is not something you want to spend time doing .
Oh yeah , SEO SpyGlass does a great job of sorting links by the value they add to the page .
2. Offer Something :
That ’s right , offer to sleep with each webmaster if they will give you a link .
Just to point out , in case of any lawsuits , SEO Spyglass do n’t recommend this .
It ’s my own strategy I am divulging for free .
But on the actual point of offering something to potential partners , this is a great strategy and should replace your link exchanging to some extent .
It ’s basic relationship market where you are offering something of value .
What can I offer for free ?
There is a tonne of stuff :
– Hand written content
– Discount on products
– Free reports
– Free ebooks
– Free access to a membership site
etc etc .
This is one area that can drive lots of results if implemented correctly .
The most important point is you wo n’t get it right each and every time .
If you fail the first time , do n’t just quit and go back to mundane link exchanging .
Find what works for your market .
3. Buy Links : YES LOTS OF THEM or make your own choices 🙂
Go to Matt Cutts blog and search for paid links
http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/
I am not going to discuss the right or wrongs on paid links as it ’s all context dependant on the market you are in !!!
To Sum UP
In case it got lost in the post somewhere , I love SEO Spyglass as a tool and highly recommend it .
I do feel their reports could be improved a little but this is n’t the main selling point of the tool and does n’t take away from all the other great features .
OK this time you better RT it RETWEET THE SHIZNET OUT OF THIS
What do you think are the best link building strategies … COMMENT AWAY !!!

A group who call themselves The Impossible Project are trying to reinvent analogue instant film made so popular by Polaroid in the 1960s and 70s .
There was a time before the advent of digital technology when , if you wanted instant gratification photographically , you turned to your trusty Polaroid camera .
Its cameras were best - sellers , and in 1974 an estimated one billion " Polaroids " were taken .
I often say God must be a lover of instant photography because the major issues ... are pretty much solved
Florian Kaps
But when digital photography took off , Polaroid saw its sales fall .
In 2008 , they decided to stop making instant film altogether .
In the cavernous rooms of one former film factory in the Dutch town of Enschede , giant assembly machines now lie dormant .
Old parts and packaging are piled high , their Polaroid rainbow logos slowly disappearing beneath layers of dust .
But in one room , a group of men gathers around a machine .
Talking excitedly , they diagnose problems and swap parts , and after several hours the machine comes to life , noisily injecting chemicals into small paper sachets .
Watching them is Austrian entrepreneur Florian Kaps , a director of The Impossible Project .
" It 's all about reinventing and restarting the production of instant film , " he said , " creating a new material to exactly meet the demands of the modern photographer that loves analogue instant photography . "
Starting from scratch
The Impossible Project began last year at the closing ceremony for the old factory .
At the time , Mr Kaps had a successful online business selling Polaroid film and accessories .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .

He got talking to the plant 's chief engineer Andre Bosman .
" We perfectly fit together , " Mr Kaps said , " because he gave me all the information I needed to see if there 's a chance to continue it , and he needed just one person that tells him that there is the demand out there . "
They decided to try to take over the factory and begin producing Polaroid film again .
Investors put up $ 3.2 m ( £ 2 m ) , but the new team could not simply restart the machines .
" Roughly half to 70 % of the crucial materials were produced by Polaroid themselves ; those plants are gone , vanished off the Earth , " said Mr Bosman , who is now the new project 's technical director .
" Basically we 're starting back from scratch where Dr Land , the founder of Polaroid , started in 1947 . "
Reinventing instant film
The invention of Polaroid instant film was one of the engineering feats of the 20th Century , managing to squeeze the complex processes of the darkroom onto a single piece of film .
Reinventing this process in one year is a big task , but the small team can draw on their more than 340 years of combined experience working in the old factory .
It 's the ultimate way to capture a moment , it 's so precious , watching it developing is incredible
Wendy Bevan , Polaroid fan " Without that you just do not stand a chance , " said Mr Bosman .
To develop the photographic elements , they are also enlisting partners including Harman Technology , the British company behind Ilford film .
They recently managed to produce their first complete and stable instant picture , and are confident they can have their first black - and - white film on the market by early 2010 .
" I often say God must be a lover of instant photography , " says Mr Kaps , " because the major issues , finding all the components , they are pretty much solved . "
But Mr Bosman admits that the tight timeframe means they have to cut corners .
" We have no idea how solid this film will be , how stable everything will be .
But you can take the chance like we did and buy this , or leave it alone . "
Like vinyl Some , like popular technology blog Boing Boing , are not convinced the project is worthwhile .
" It just seems like an awful lot of effort to go through to recreate something that is not just antiquated , but practically obviated by modern technology , " the blog wrote .
Digital photographers can take thousands of shots , manipulate them , and share them on social networking sites quickly and easily .
There are even applications to make them look like classic Polaroids .
So why pay about $ 23 ( £ 14 ) for eight shots of the new film ?
Wendy Bevan has had her Polaroid photographs published in magazines like i-D and Vogue .
" I love the tactile side of it , so you 've got something you can hold straight away , " she says .
" It 's the ultimate way to capture a moment , it 's so precious , watching it developing is incredible . "
Instant film made by other companies is not compatible with the most popular Polaroid cameras , so the new Impossible film will be the only option for many Polaroid fans .
But given the sheer popularity of digital photography , is there enough of a market ?
" There are 300 to 500 million working Polaroid cameras out there , it 's huge , and 24 million films have been sold last year , " Mr Kaps said .
" Our aim is to sell one million next year .
I do n't have any fear that we can sell it . "
" I think the best example of how successfully this can work is the old vinyl record that has a revival and people start buying it . "

( CNN ) --
For years , dentists have warned patients about the decaying effects of cola and sugary , fizzy drinks on their teeth .
Acidic drinks that are healthier than soda caused tooth erosion in dental experiments .
Research shows that other drinks thought to be better -- fruit juices , teas and energy drinks -- can also have harmful effects on teeth , turning the pearly whites to shrinking , spotted yellows marred with pockmarks .
Dentists say sipping fluorescent - colored sports drinks , carbonated beverages and citric fruit juices bathe the teeth in harmful acids .
The constant exposure strips the hard , protective layer of the tooth called the enamel and could dissolve the entire tooth .
" We all became aware of the sugar on your teeth .
What most of us do n't know is the acid , " said Dr. Mohamed Bassiouny , a restorative dentistry professor at Temple University .
" Cavities form when bacteria in the mouth mixes with sugar , leading to decay .
Erosion occurs when chemicals strip the mineral off the teeth .
" The seriousness of the erosion is far more than decay , " said Bassiouny .
" Erosion affects all teeth at once , as you can imagine acidic fluid is running through the entire mouth . "
This causes hypersensitivity , discoloration and cracks on the teeth .
Serious cases require crowns or even dentures if entire teeth have disintegrated .
Research in Europe has linked that acidic beverage consumption to increasing tooth erosion .
A person who has bulimia or acid reflux disease could get tooth erosion , because of stomach acids in their mouth , but the more common culprits are often beverages , Bassiouny said .
Here are some of them :
Energy drinks
Researchers at the University of Iowa 's College of Dentistry found that energy drinks and sports drinks , such as Gatorade and Red Bull , eroded the enamel more than soda and fruit juices .
In a 2008 study published in the journal Nutrition Research , the dentists soaked extracted human teeth in various liquids for 25 hours , and then measured the structural changes , or lesions .
" Power drinks can be quite acidic , usually because there is an addition of citric acid to those to give it tartness that is desired by some consumers , " said Dr. Clark Stanford , the associate dean for research at the University of Iowa College of Dentistry .
" It 's important to look at the label and see if citric acid has been added . "
Soda ( including diet )
Dentists have warned for years the perils of carbonated beverages .
But do n't disregard diet drinks .
The lack of sugar in these products does n't mean they do n't erode the teeth , Bassiouny said .
Carbonation could make the drink more acidic , he said .
A patient whom Bassiouny examined had drunk a liter of diet soda every day for the last three years .
He likened her teeth to those of a methamphetamine user .
The corrosive chemicals from the drug can cause extensive oral damage commonly known as " meth mouth , " in which teeth decay , crack and crumble .
Citric juices
A study published this year in the Journal of Dentistry showed that orange juice decreased enamel hardness by 84 percent .
Lemon , orange and grapefruit juice can strip away the enamel with their acidity .
" We encourage adults if they 're going to have kids drink fruit juices , which is good in a way , that they consume it all at once instead of sipping on it all day long , " Stanford said .
Lemon juice showed the highest erosion , according to Bassiouny 's study , which was published in the May - June issue of General Dentistry .
" We 're not saying , ' Do n't drink orange juice , " Bassiouny said .
" Do n't drink orange juice then go to the office , then have a diet soda at lunchtime .
You are asking for trouble because of the frequency of the contact and the challenge of the acid contact to your teeth . "
Tea
The drink sometimes considered a super food because of its antioxidant content can cause tooth erosion , but not as much as citric juices , soda and energy and sports drinks .
In Bassiouny 's study , human teeth were soaked in unsweetened green and black tea , and they did not erode until the 16th week .
Teeth soaked in lemon juice , vinegar , and soda showed physical changes by the second week .
Teeth soaked in black tea eroded more rapidly than those in green tea .
Do n't Miss Using dentists as dope dealers
" Tea is controversial , " Stanford said .
" Certain types of tea can actually stabilize the amount of tooth loss or demineralization of the surface .
Others , if they have a low pH , can cause natural erosion of the tooth surface . "
This does n't mean people should avoid tea or citric juices , Bassiouny said .
The key is to practice moderation .
He suggested keeping acidic beverages to fewer than five servings a week and avoiding sugary canned teas .
Limitations
Dentists acknowledge that the methodology of the erosion studies have flaws .
The teeth were soaked in beverages because it 's impossible to re-create the human mouth in a laboratory .
And the experiments do not take into consideration the natural defense humans have against acid -- their saliva .
" Saliva naturally protects teeth to reverse the acid attack , " Stanford said .
While the studies have limitations , this should not discount the findings , Bassiouny said .
The dental studies attempt to show the accelerated effect of a person drinking common beverages .
" We adopted a lab setup to simulate the number of hours that the patient has been exposed to that challenge and to magnify that , " he said .
Basic tips to avoid tooth erosion
Drink the acidic beverage at once , instead of sipping it all day
Use a straw to avoid the teeth from being immersed in liquid
Substitute acidic beverages with water
Rinse mouth with water after drinking acidic beverage instead of brushing .
The bristles of the toothbrush may damage the enamel .

A Long Island mom guzzled vodka and smoked pot in a minivan packed with young kids before speeding the wrong way down the Taconic Parkway , sparking the head - on collision that killed eight , authorities revealed yesterday .
Diane Schuler had knocked back the equivalent of 10 shots of 80 - proof booze and smoked marijuana as recently as 15 minutes before the horrific July 26 smash - up , officials said .
Cops later found a broken 1.75 - liter bottle of Absolut vodka inside Schuler ’s van , which burst into flames after the crash , said State Police Maj .
William Carey .
The crash killed Schuler , her 2 - year - old daughter and three young nieces , as well as three men in the car she hit .
Her 5 - year - old son miraculously survived the crash .
Schuler had a blood - alcohol content of .19 percent — more than twice the legal limit of .08 percent , authorities said .
She also had 6 grams of undigested booze in her stomach , they said .
In addition , the West Babylon resident had “ a high number ” — 113 nanograms per milliliter — of THC , the active component of marijuana , in her bloodstream , said Betsy Spratt , chief toxicologist with the Westchester DA ’s Office .
That indicated Schuler smoked pot 15 minutes to one hour before the crash , Spratt said .
With the alcohol alone , Schuler , 36 , “ would have had difficulty with perception , with her judgment , with her memory , ” Spratt said .
“ Around that level of alcohol , you also start to get tunnel vision . ”
When combined with marijuana , “ those effects are intensified , ” she said .
Schuler ’s husband , Nassau County public - safety officer Daniel Schuler , has told police that his wife occasionally smoked pot and was a social drinker , WCBS - TV reported .
Schuler ’s relatives were informed of the toxicology results after the funerals for the family late last week .
The relatives of her other victims were outraged when they learned about them yesterday .
“ We were victims the first time , but now we feel like we ’re being victims all over again because she made that choice , ” said Roseann Guzzo , whose 49 - year - old brother , Guy Bastardi , and father , Michael Bastardi , 81 , were killed when their SUV was hit by Schuler ’s van .
“ It ’s horrendous , ” Guzzo said .
“ It ’s making it worse for us now .
“ How do you put five children in a car when you ’re a mother who ’s a drunk ? ” she asked .
“ It ’s crazy . ”
Outside the Floral Park , LI , house of Schuler ’s brother , Warren Hance , whose three daughters died in the tragedy , a neighbor said , “ She ’s gonna burn in hell . ”
Carey , of the State Police , said that before the toxicology results , “ We simply had no evidence that drugs or alcohol [ were ] at play . . .
We do not have much in the way of people that morning describing Diane Schuler , other than saying she was fine . ”
While police do not expect to criminally charge anyone in the case — which has been classified as a homicide by the Westchester County Medical Examiner ’s Office — they plan to further investigate the events that lead to the horrific cash .
“ At this point , we ’re getting limited information from the family , ” Carey said .
“ Obviously , the family is going through a grieving process .
We ’ve conducted some interviews with family members .
We have not conducted as many interviews as we would like . ”
The disclosure that Schuler was heavily intoxicated cleared up some of the mystery that had surrounded the smashup , which occurred about four hours after she left an upstate campground with no apparent signs of intoxication .
The most perplexing question had been why Schuler , who was on her way home , would have entered the Taconic near Briarcliff Manor going the wrong way — southbound in the northbound lane — and continued on for nearly two miles before hitting the Bastardis ’ SUV .
For days , there had been speculation that the Cablevision executive had become disoriented because of a previously unknown medical condition or that she was suicidal .
Schuler had spent the weekend with Daniel , their 2 - year - old daughter , Erin , 5 - year - old son , Bryan , and three nieces — the Hance girls Emma , 8 , Alyson , 7 , and 5 - year - old Katie — at the Hunter Lake Campgrounds in upstate Parksville .
The Schulers had been regular visitors there for the past three years , according to campground owner Ann Scott , 76 .
“ They ’re an ordinary family like you or I or apple pie , ” Scott said .
“ I ’ve never seen them have an argument , never seen them with a drink .
All they did was relax on their site with their kids .
“ I swear on my grandmother ’s Bible , I ’ve never seen them with a drink in their hand . ”
The Schulers separately left the campgrounds at about 9:30 a.m. on July 26 .
Daniel was driving with the family dog in his Dodge pickup , while Diane was taking the children in her Ford Windstar minivan .
Daniel could not follow Diane onto any parkway because his truck has commercial plates .
“ She was fine .
She was the same old Diane she was every weekend , ” said Scott .
“ The last words I said were , ‘ Have a safe trip home . ’ ”
But the trip soon went horribly wrong .
Schuler stopped at a McDonald ’s on Route 17 in Liberty and then headed onto Interstate 87 , where numerous witnesses saw her driving recklessly .
She then turned east onto the highway and was seen driving across a grass divider at the Ramapo service area .
At 1 p.m. , she crossed the Tappan Zee Bridge heading east .
Two minutes later , Schuler pulled over and called her brother , Hance , who was at home , and said she was having trouble seeing and was disoriented .
During that eight - minute call , Hance also spoke with his daughter Emma .
It was unclear if Hance knew his sister had been drinking , but he told her to stay put and he would come get her .
Schuler instead drove off , and bizarrely dropped the phone off at a rest stop .
Hance then called police to alert them about his sister ’s call , but they were unable to locate her in time .
Schuler was supposed to get on the Saw Mill River Parkway heading south but ended up getting on the Saw Mill north .
She then made her way to the Taconic — where she entered via an exit ramp and headed south in the northbound lanes , terrifying other drivers who swerved across three lanes to avoid her .
It was on the Taconic at 1:35 p.m. — after going 1.7 miles the wrong way — that the minivan smashed head - on into the SUV carrying the Bastardis and their friend and fellow Yonkers resident , 74 - year - old Daniel Longo .
An upstate couple , Angela and Dean Tallarico , also were injured when their SUV was hit by the Bastardi ’s vehicle after the initial crash .
When a reporter yesterday told Angela Tallarico of Schuler ’s intoxication , she burst into tears .
“ Oh , no ! ” she cried before calling out to a co-worker , “ She was drunk ! ”
Daniel Schuler ducked reporters yesterday after visiting Bryan at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla , where the boy was in stable condition , a source said .
Michael Bastardi Jr. , another son of Michael Sr. , said “ I ’m just kind of in disbelief ” and “ numb . ”
“ We want to figure out what happened . ”
Scott , the campground owner , said , “ This is the most shocking news that I ’ve heard in my lifetime .
“ If this is true , she ’ll be treated like a monster .
“ Dear God , what ’s her brother thinking at this point ?
What ’s her husband thinking ?
You ’ve lost [ four ] children , and there ’s no reason for it .
Everyone ’s been turned upside down by this .
“ When I learned it this morning , I dropped the phone .
It ’s absolutely terrible . ”

Good Lord .
Things really ARE that bad when it comes to the patent law mess , are n't they ?
I was admittedly hopeful when I first heard that the Supreme Court would be hearing this case .
Now , I 'm not so sure .
[ Comment at 08/10/2009 01:25 PM by Justin Levine ]
Gee , sounds like the various positions Libertarians take with an array of matters .
So , what you are saying is that patent law is just like any other human endeavor , whether it be easements and emminent domain or medical treatment , there are tons of opinions .
Just because people do not agree on the meaning of a body of law ( which happens with all laws , and all politics ) , the law may still be publicly beneficial and serve a social need .
Your lengthy list is merely a list of opinions , which you use to support your opinion , which is one of another lengthy list of opinions .
Thus , you have proven unequivocally that people will have an array of opinions on any issue you wish to name .
Congratulations .
[ Comment at 08/11/2009 06:17 AM by Anonymous ]
Anonymous , I think you missed the point .
It 's one thing to have different people with different opinions on an issue , but it 's a completely different thing to make one of these opinions " the only morally correct " law for everyone .
The conclusion is that if an issue spawns so many varying opinions , any one of the opinions cannot be forced on everybody else as a " universal law " .
What we 're looking for here would probably be some kind of polycentric law I guess ?
[ Comment at 08/13/2009 11:24 PM by Samuel Hora ]
Samuel : Laws and rules are an embodiment of an opinion as " the only morally correct " law for everyone .
Your conclusion does not hold .
Some people think murder is unequivocally wrong .
There are others who see murder as justifiable in some circumstances .
Others see murder as unavoidable in some circumstances .
Our laws are clear , in spite of the numerous opinions on the subject , we have deemed it in our society 's best interest to force the opinion of the majority on everyone .
Pick any rule or law , and you will find numerous opinions on the subject .
Yet , we have forced , as a society , one opinion on everyone .
Is that right ?
When it comes to interactions we need some measure of predictability , so , yes , it is right for our society .
As a secondary issue , the nearly 40 references above do not represent 40 different opinions .
Some opinions agree .
Others cover different aspects of intellectual property law .
It is ridiculuous to claim that there are 40 different opinions about the same intellectual property law .
Further , such opinions are part of the freedom of speech and healthy debate over the scope and value of intellectual property law .
I would think that as a Libertarian you would applaud such exploration of knowledge and opinion rather than thinking that it is somehow an indication that something is " wrong . "
If diversity of opinion is a hallmark of moral wrong , then Libertarians are in serious trouble .
[ Comment at 08/14/2009 05:25 AM by Anonymous ]
" If diversity of opinion is a hallmark ... " - maybe you should re-read my post .
I see nothing wrong with different people having different opinions nor with discussing them .
It 's wrong to pick one of them and force it violently on others .
" ... we have forced , as a society , one opinion on everyone ... " - not " WE " , not " a society " , but a group of people forced one opinion on everybody else VIOLENTLY .
That is wrong ( even if it was a 99 % majority ) .
[ Comment at 08/14/2009 10:28 AM by Samuel Hora ]
Samuel : So , fundamentally all laws are wrong .
Okay .
Then there is no point of discussing anything further .
Our system of government is founded on majority rule .
Fundamentally , 50.1 % of the population makes the rules for 100 % of the population , and " we " agreed to this type of rule 200 + years ago .
If you disagree , you may certainly express your opinion , but you too are required to live by these rules as long as you stay within the boundaries of the United States .
On the other hand , I am unaware of any nations founded on Libertarian principles .
[ Comment at 08/14/2009 02:16 PM by Anonymous ]
You again misread my post .
I did not say " all laws " are wrong .
Violently forcing them on those who did n't agree with them is .
You might also want to re-evaluate your statistics .
Did really more than 50 % of all vote for whatever there is in a government ?
And did the voters agree with everything they were voting for or perhaps they were just choosing the lesser of two evils ?
And who is this " WE " you keep talking about ?
Certainly it is n't everybody .
I am unaware of any way a " nation " could be " founded " on libertarian principles .
What if a group of people need not to be a " nation " nor be " founded " to be free ?
[ Comment at 08/15/2009 12:46 AM by Samuel Hora ]
Forgive me for butting in ; I can not resist .
Majority rule or its variants ( modern democracy ) might well be the most practical form of government that we have so far been able to devise .
Certainly nobody will deny that it is an improvement over despotism , and other such forms of government that humanity has seen in recent history .
However , Samuel is not , nor is any other libertarian , advancing " libertarianism " as an alternative for majority rule .
The libertarian point is not about how to decide on matters of the state but about what is a matter of the state and what is n't .
Libertarians feel that , regardless of the form of government , no government may invade the rights of individuals .
For example , no government may decide that black men can be owned as property .
Whether the deciding entity is the majority of the population , a tyrant , a communist party is irrelevant .
What a government does is not necessarily legitimate just because it is supported by the majority of the population .
[ Comment at 08/15/2009 04:43 PM by Kid ]
Kid : Regardless of what Samuel said , his earlier statement was that any law voted for by less than 100 % of the people that applies to all people is forced on those that did not vote for it , and is therefore wrong .
However , Samuel always has the right to move to another country if he believes he is being forced to obey speed limits and respect the intellectual property rights of others .
Far be it from me to stop him .
[ Comment at 08/15/2009 05:11 PM by Anonymous ]
Anonymous :
If government expands its business beyond the boundaries set by individual rights , is it then not true that any law that is not consented to by 100 % of the population is in discord with libertarian principles ?
After all , the rights of the individuals that did not consent are then illegitimately being violated .
Leaving people the option of moving to another country is very generous , and not afforded to citizens of every state ( North Korea for example ) .
However , offering the choice between moving your family to another country and following an illegitimate law still seems coercive .
[ Comment at 08/16/2009 01:36 PM by Kid ]
Kid :
The moment the government makes a law , it expands its business beyond the boundaries set by individual rights .
Ergo , all laws are in discord with Libertarian principles .
However , that also questions whether Libertarian principles can ever be valid .
If someone is born into a society and that someone disagrees with the rules of that society , and society perpetually refuses to change its principles to match the arbitrary principles of the individual , then what hope does the individual ever have of attaining any sort of legitimacy ?
... following an illegitimate law still seems coercive .
Since all laws are illegitimate according to Libertarian principles , it seems that the only hope for Libertarians is to purchase a place to have their own country .

" If someone is born ... " - I do n't see how that invalidates the principles of freedom .
" Society " ( ie. all the other people ) need not changing their individual contracts between each other in order to " legitimize " the newcomer .
He is free to propose his own contracts to them and each one of them is free to accept or decline .
" ... the only hope ... " -
If you were constantly harassed by a gang of criminals in a current system with ineffective justice ( eg. restaurant extortion in eastern europe ) , is your only hope to leave ?
Or perhaps you have a slight chance to defend yourself by allying with neighboring restaurants ?
" ... respect the intellectual property rights of others ... " - I would gladly respect others ' rights except in this particular case no one was ever successful in proving they have such a right .
Also , the state cannot grant rights that it does n't have in the first place .

Yes , but the situation we are in now is that the newcomer has proposed his own contract , but society has declined accepting the contract of the newcomer ( meaning the established laws of our society have not changed ) , and the newcomer keeps bitching about it , perhaps hoping that harassment will accomplish a change .
" ... the only hope ... " -

But , we are not talking about being harassed by a gang of criminals , are we ?
In fact , we are not talking about the actions of others , but the actions of the newcomers .
In fact , some or many of the previous members of the society may feel that the newcomer is a member of " ... a gang of criminals ... " attempting to violently violate the established laws of the system that they believe has effective justice .
" ... respect the intellectual property rights of others ... " - I would gladly respect others ' rights except in this particular case no one was ever successful in proving they have such a right .
The Constitution of the United States of America ( perhaps you have heard of this document ) granted the Congress of the United States of America the ability to grant such rights .
The ability to grant these rights has been challenged to the Supreme Court of the United States of America and been upheld time after time after time after time ... ad infinitum .
How much proof do you need that the rights were granted under the Constitution ?
Also , the state cannot grant rights that it does n't have in the first place .
Ah , but the Constitution was written , re-written , and debated at length .
Then , individual states further reviewed it and debated it , eventually affirming that the people of those states would support the Constitution as it was written .
You are in wrong that the state granted any rights that is did not have .
The people of the United States of America ultimately permitted the state the ability to grant those rights .
Once the state has been granted the ability to control rights , whether to physical property or intellectul property , the people would need to agree to take that ability away , and they people have yet to do so .
[ Comment at 08/17/2009 05:28 AM by Anonymous ]
The constitution gave no power to grant privileges , such as copyright and patent , only power to secure natural rights .
The state certainly had the incumbent power to soon grant such privileges irrespective of the constitution , but that does n't mean ( post hoc ergo propter hoc ) that power came from the constitution .
As you observe , the people have n't yet got around to realising the fiat privileges are illegitimate , unconstitutional .
That realisation is n't far off though ...

Ah so when a person is being harassed by a gang of criminals and is not powerful enough to resist them and defend himself , according to you he effectively " permits " them to modify his property rights and by this they become legitimate ?
[ Comment at 08/17/2009 03:28 PM by Samuel Hora ]
Crosbie : I think the Constitution is quite clear : Congress has the power ...
To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries ;
The " exclusive right " to their writings and discoveries is unequivocal .
Exclusive means others do not have a " right " to the writings of authors and inventions of inventors for a limited time .
For patents , the " limited time " chosen by our Congress as well as the nations of the world is 20 years from the date of filing .
[ Comment at 08/18/2009 05:14 AM by Anonymous ]
' Exclusive right ' means the right the author already has ( in nature ) to exclude others from their writings .
It does not mean the author ( or even congress ) can deny any right of others .
Monopolists would certainly love the latter meaning , but the constitution was drawn up to protect / secure individuals ' rights , not to deny or suspend them , nor to create a transferable privilege that denied them .
Copyright is such a privilege , and so it is a contradiction in terms for a privilege to represent the securing of an author 's exclusive right to their writings .
The constitution is indeed quite clear , so it takes a deal of linguistic misinterpretation to infer it sanctioned the granting of monopolies ( that were , unforeseeably to the Framers , unconstitutionally granted a few years later anyway ) .
Of course , if you have been brainwashed into believing that the constitution sanctions the granting of monopolies you will perceive it to do so ( based upon a received , corrupt interpretation ) .
Bear in mind that the modern meaning of ' exclusive right ' actually comes from the modern interpretation of copyright , not from the Framer 's recognition of an author 's natural exclusive right .
Copyright is the legally granted right ( or privilege ) to exclude others from reproduction or performance of one 's works ( hence ' exclusive right ' ) - not the constitutionally recognised right .
To suppose that the Framers were specifying the yet to be legislated privilege was to be secured is putting the cart before the horse .
The constitution cannot empower congress to secure a privilege yet to be legislated , it can only empower congress to secure the individual 's already extant natural rights , i.e. their natural exclusive right to their writings .
If the constitution was to sanction copyright it would have to give congress power to grant such privileges as monopolies .
And , granting a privilege is rather different to securing a right .
To do such a thing was also anathema to the Framers , and would be fundamentally incompatible with a constitution even if they had wanted them granted .
[ Comment at 08/18/2009 07:05 AM by Crosbie Fitch ]
" Bear in mind that the modern meaning of ' exclusive right ' actually comes from the modern interpretation of copyright , not from the Framer 's recognition of an author 's natural exclusive right . "
The framers never recognized a natural right in IP .
They recognized it was purely civil -- artificial , limited , temporary , and designed to achieve a policy goal .
[ Comment at 08/18/2009 07:12 AM by Stephan Kinsella ]
Stephan , can you clarify whether you are talking about a ) congress and their decision to legislate copyright or b ) the Framers and their recognition of an author 's exclusive right and that congress should have power to secure it . ?
The decision to legislate copyright may well have been made by congress as the granting of a monopoly as a means of incentivising authors to publish their works , to achieve a policy goal .
However , that 's a completely different issue from the Framers ' recognition of the rights of the individual and the empowerment of a government to protect them .
Incidentally , that patent and copyright are quite different animals should be a big clue that they are monopolies legislated in the interests of congress ( and their lobbyists ) , not aspects of an individual 's natural right recognised by the constitution .
It would be spooky for nature to imbue a difference between mechanical designs ( similarity ) and graphical expressions ( provenance ) .
[ Comment at 08/18/2009 08:14 AM by Crosbie Fitch ]
Crosbie : ' Exclusive right ' means the right the author already has ( in nature ) to exclude others from their writings .
I understand that is your belief .
I disagree .
[ Comment at 08/18/2009 11:50 AM by Anonymous ]
It seems to me you 've got it round the wrong way .
You are stating your understanding or belief .
I am presenting an argument .
One 's understanding or belief lends no support to an argument ( though it may affect how one argues ) .
I do n't doubt that many devoutly believe the US Constitution sanctions the granting of monopolies .
However , that belief is immaterial to any argument as to whether it actually does .
[ Comment at 08/19/2009 04:54 AM by Crosbie Fitch ]
Samuel : " If someone is born ... " - sorry , I do n't see how your response relates to what we were debating in this topic .
You have still not demonstrated what and how anything " questions whether Libertarian principles can ever be valid " .
* sigh *
We are going in circles .
Let me try again .
100 people form a society .
They decide , based on their observation of nature , that ownership of property is unnatural .
Indeed , " nature " owns all property , with the animals that use that property doing so in a transitory fashion .
For example , predators maintain control of a territory , but they do so for a limited time , after which the land becomes available for other predators .
Emulating natural rights of animals , the 100 people decide that all property shall be owned collectively , but control over portions of that property will be given to either individuals or groups for as long as the collective decides that it is in the best interest of the collective to assign such control .
A new individual joins the group of 100 , proclaiming that it is a " natural " right that an individual should " own " property ( land , in this case ) .
However , the society realizes that the unnatural belief in individual ownership of land is antithetical to their own belief in true natural rights .
Now , arbitrarily , let us call the society , " society . "
Let us arbitrarily call the newcomer a " Libertarian . "
The Libertarian 's belief in individual ownership of land is unnatural according to Society , and Society can never countenance a belief so extremely antithetical to their own .
Ergo , the newcomer must either acquiesce to Society or the newcomer must go elsewhere .
" ... the only hope ... " - I was referring to the criminal state which violently and illegitimately forces it 's regulations on the people .
You are here contradicting yourself and you 're attempting to present a circular argument .
Other than alleging a circular argument , you have not presented facts showing that I have a circular argument .
Regardless , I inferred from your comments that you were describing Democratic society and the rules the society have created as the " criminal state . "
If that is not the case , then I stand corrected .
However , if that is the case , then your comments appear to be meaningless because they are without context .
Let us suppose that you claim that our current laws are from a " criminal state " which " violently and illegitimately " are forced on " the people . "
However , as has been demonstrated throughout history , " the people " of the United States have the power to change unjust laws .
Witness the support for Obama 's disastrous health care system .
First , support was quite strong , but as people began to realize that the only way such a system would work is to impose ruinous , massive and illegitimate taxes on wage earners , " the people " have begun to express their disinterest in the system as proposed , and it is nearly assured that the current proposal will not pass .
Similarly , the rights established and agreed upon by " the people " with respect to patents serve a public policy goal and have been agreed , both explicitly and tacitly , to be a valuable form of extremely limited monopoly .
That you disagree with that monopoly is fine , but you are not permitted to abrogate the will of the people unilaterally .
You may use the legitimate structure of social organization to change the laws , but you are not permitted to ignore them , otherwise you would be a criminal and we would have anarchy .
" The Constitution ... " - a paper nor any authority cannot grant rights or abilities that do n't exist .
Even if everybody at some time agreed on a common contract ( let 's call it a constitution ) , that contract does not bind those who did n't agree with it ( yet ) , for example those that were yet to be born .
Ah , but that is not true .
Those who have yet to be born are required by existing society to follow the rules of that society , or work to change them .
Otherwise , anarchy would ensue .
In fact , you are bound to follow those rules and I would be willing to bet you do so daily , regardless of whether you like the rules .
There is no constitutional right for people to ignore the laws established by their forefathers .
Here you establish not logic , but a belief .
You believe that a contract between two entities should not be binding on someone that inherits the contract .
However , our laws , indeed , our society , has deemed that such contracts are in fact inheritable .
Such has been common law and embodied law for centuries .
Those who fail to accept the terms of such pre-existing contracts are typically considered criminals .
" ... and been upheld ... " - how ?
Will you please finally provide something that is not a circular argument ?
Would you please explain how this is a circular argument ?
The constitution is a contract among the citizens of the United States , a condition of living as a citizen in the United States .
If you do not agree with the contract , you are free to leave .
You are not free to disregard the contract .
That is not a circular argument , that is a fact of society .
Indeed , all societies have a common contract that outlines the rights , rules and responsibilities of the citizens of that society .
Born into that society , or choose to move into that society , and you are required to accept those rules , or to non-violently work to change them .
You are not morally permitted to disregard them - which would be seen as violent and illegitimate by the members of that society , making that person a violent criminal .
" ... states ... affirming that the people ... support ... " - that is a non sequitur .
I do n't see how a " state 's " opinion suddenly becomes " the people 's " agreement .
( 1 ) Group of people meet .
( 2 ) Group of people decide that it is in their best interest to attain a level of uniformity .
( 3 ) Group of people decide upon and select a group of rights for the people in the society , rules for people in the society , and responsibilities for people in the society .
( 4 ) The group of rights , rules and responsibilities are maintained by an organization called the state , which remains subservient to the will of the people through the ability to change the rights , rules and responsibilities .
( 5 ) The state only has an " opinion , " a word that you used , not me , to the extent that the people have an opinion .
Indeed , the state should NOT have an opinion , only a responsibility to exercise the will of the people .
The only non-sequitur here is your attempt to add words to my comments that did not previously exist .
" The people ... ultimately permitted the state ... " -
Ah so when a person is being harassed by a gang of criminals and is not powerful enough to resist them and defend himself , according to you he effectively " permits " them to modify his property rights and by this they become legitimate ?
Good heavens .
Why do you think we have laws ?
The laws exist to stop the gang of criminals , for example , those who would take away an inventor 's ability to have a limited exclusive right to an invention , from harassing the inventor , eliminating rights granted to the inventor for the benefit of society .
Would I have those sick , demented individuals legitimized ?
Absolutely not .
The laws of the state should balance the needs of individuals with the needs of society .
If the laws fail to do that , " the people " need to modify the laws to assure such balance does occur , not harass others with their ill - conceived beliefs .

Crosbie : ' Exclusive right ' means the right the author already has ( in nature ) to exclude others from their writings .
It does not mean the author ( or even congress ) can deny any right of others .
You state in your later post that you present arguments , not beliefs .
I submit that the two statements above are purely belief and are not arguments .
Monopolists would certainly love the latter meaning , but the constitution was drawn up to protect / secure individuals ' rights , not to deny or suspend them , nor to create a transferable privilege that denied them .
Yes , the constitution was drawn up to protect and secure individual 's rights , but it was also drawn up to define the limitation of government .
One such limitation included the ability to provide for exclusivity of copyright and patents .
You may attempt to subvert the intention with your own interpretation , but that is still not an argument , but a belief .
Copyright is such a privilege , and so it is a contradiction in terms for a privilege to represent the securing of an author 's exclusive right to their writings .
Pardon me , but did you miss a step in your writing ?
Copyright is a privilege secured by the constitution , and it DOES represent the securing of an author 's exclusive right to their writing for a limited time .
Again , you do not present an argument , but an interpretation or belief .
The constitution is indeed quite clear , so it takes a deal of linguistic misinterpretation to infer it sanctioned the granting of monopolies ( that were , unforeseeably to the Framers , unconstitutionally granted a few years later anyway ) .
Wait a moment .
Most of the Framers of the constitution were alive when the first copyright was granted ONLY two years after the constitution was ratified .
Separately , Rhode Island ratified the constitution AFTER the first patent act .
If the Framers truly disagreed with copyrights , which were granted nearly immediately after ratification of the constitution , and patents , which were granted PRIOR to ratification of the constitution , they had plenty of opportunity to rail about the abuse of the constitution .
However , they did not .
Certainly the Framers were already aware of the the pros and cons of patents , given that the first patents in the area that became the United States may have been granted in the 1600's and given their active discussion of the English patent system .
The first patent act was passed only two short years after the constitution was ratified .
Thomas Jefferson then wrote a new act in 1793 , after having an opportunity to mull over the constitution and patents .
Clearly , had Jefferson been opposed to patents and monopoly , or thought they violated a constitution he helped write , he had a perfect opportunity to weaken the applicability of patents , but he did not .
Given Jefferson 's earlier concerns about the potential abuses of monopoly , one can only conclude that Jefferson recognized that the constitution literally meant that the fruits of an inventor 's labor ( and similarly , that of author 's ) , should be secured for a limted period of time to only the inventor or the author .
To imply any other meaning would be twisting the language and meaning of the constitution .
Of course , if you have been brainwashed into believing that the constitution sanctions the granting of monopolies you will perceive it to do so ( based upon a received , corrupt interpretation ) .
Of course , you have been eating your own propaganda for so long that you no longer have an unbiased , uncorrupted viewpoint of the brilliance of Thomas Jefferson and the constitution .
Bear in mind that the modern meaning of ' exclusive right ' actually comes from the modern interpretation of copyright , not from the Framer 's recognition of an author 's natural exclusive right .
Copyright is the legally granted right ( or privilege ) to exclude others from reproduction or performance of one 's works ( hence ' exclusive right ' ) - not the constitutionally recognised right .
To suppose that the Framers were specifying the yet to be legislated privilege was to be secured is putting the cart before the horse .
The constitution cannot empower congress to secure a privilege yet to be legislated , it can only empower congress to secure the individual 's already extant natural rights , i.e. their natural exclusive right to their writings .
It is unfortunate that you continue to put words in Thomas Jefferson 's mouth .
Jefferson knew quite well what the " exclusive right " would be .
He knew quite well that it was in fact a monopoly , because he said so .
You may wish to believe otherwise , and belief is a lovely thing , but not supported by the framers of the constitution unless you misinterpret their rather clear statements .
If the constitution was to sanction copyright it would have to give congress power to grant such privileges as monopolies .
And , granting a privilege is rather different to securing a right .
To do such a thing was also anathema to the Framers , and would be fundamentally incompatible with a constitution even if they had wanted them granted .
Again , belief , not argument or fact .
The Framers knew quite well the implication of patents and copyright , because both had existed well before the creation of the constitution .
In fact , there was discussion and analysis of the English system of patent and the Framers wanted the advantages of such a system without some of the disadvantages .
Again , they knew quite well that they were granting a monopoly for a limited period of time and they knew the implications of that monopoly .
Thomas Jefferson was so concerned about the right being secured by the language that he suggested the monopoly should be monitored to see if it was too liberal .
Difficult to be more clear than that .
If you wish to argue regarding " promoting the progress , " okay , fine .
But arguing " exclusive right " ?
Jefferson and Madison knew exactly what they were doing .

[ Comment at 08/19/2009 10:43 AM by Anonymous ]
Well , then let 's agree to dispense with belief and restrict ourselves to argument .
What you call my belief , I call my contention .
Your suggestion that the ' ability to provide for exclusivity of copyright and patents ' , is a limitation of government is what I call a subversion ( and a poorly expressed one at that ) .
A proper limitation of government is to be restricted to the protection of rights , not to be permitted their derogation through the granting of privileges .
As Thomas Paine observed , by annulling rights in the majority , privileges leave the right , by exclusion , in the hands of a few - and are consequently instruments of injustice .
The constitution cannot empower congress to secure privileges that are legislated after it ( beyond its knowledge ) - for it to do so it would have to first legislate the privilege ( the constitution recognises rights to be secured , not privileges to be granted ) .
And privileges unlike rights are not secured , but enforced ( by the holder of the privilege ) .
As an aside , if the constitution had truly intended copyright to be enacted and enforced by congress , it would have been a matter for the police rather than the privileged to protect .
I am aware that copyright and patent or analogues thereof were already legislated / granted in various states at the time of the Constitution .
That many would have those privileges continue does n't enable the Constitution to recognise them .
It was necessarily a clean slate , could not refer to pre-existing privileges ( or any other legislation ) , and so had to restrict itself to the securing only of authors ' and inventors ' natural exclusive right to their writings and designs .
I appreciate that it was the keenness to see those monopolies re-enacted that persuaded such a lax interpretation of the constitution .
It is widely recognised that Jefferson disparaged patents , so I 'm doubtful that Jefferson was the driving force in their enactment - as opposed to a moderating influence .
Madison seems far more likely as their true champion .
Perhaps you can cite clear evidence that Jefferson had a change of heart and switched from antipathy toward patents into enthusiastic advocacy ?
You say that the Framers knew they were granting a monopoly .
However , although perhaps some of them may have believed the clause in the constitution empowered congress to grant such monopolies , it did n't actually do so .
It only empowered congress to secure the pre-existing natural exclusive right , not to create a privilege that would later be termed as such .
A constitution cannot specify the securing of a privilege that has yet to be legislated .
A constitution empowers a government to protect the people and their rights .
It cannot , even if it wanted to , empower a government to create privileges that derogate from those rights .

Crosbie : Amazingly good post .
My congratulations , sir .
You avoided belief and substituted questions posited in a thoughtful and probing way .
Indeed , had I seen the post you just made , I likely would not have commented on it because it is more exploratory and analystical than judgmental and expository .
I wish all posts on this site were similarly as well written .
Having given you my congratulations , I attempt to respond , where I am able .
Your suggestion that the ' ability to provide for exclusivity of copyright and patents ' , is a limitation of government is what I call a subversion ( and a poorly expressed one at that ) .
I know you call this ability a subversion .
I respect your description , though I disagree with it .
I concur with Thomas Jefferson 's opinion on the subject .
It is widely recognised that Jefferson disparaged patents , so I 'm doubtful that Jefferson was the driving force in their enactment - as opposed to a moderating influence .
Madison seems far more likely as their true champion .
Perhaps you can cite clear evidence that Jefferson had a change of heart and switched from antipathy toward patents into enthusiastic advocacy ?
Actually , both Madison and Jefferson had concerns about patents .
Regardless , I offer the following evidence that shows some of Jefferson 's state of mind and his eventual opinion about patents : ( 1 ) " Jefferson , who called the Office " the Board of Arts " took pride in this duty and gave personal consideration to every application for a patent that was filed between 1790 and 1793 .
He hoped to be as fair as possible in his administration of patents and to try to develop a system that worked for the benefit of all both inventors and the common man .
The system had to work in such a way as to foster invention without making new inventions untouchable to the people . "
From http://www.earlyamerica.com/review/winter2000/jefferson.html
( 2 ) " He " agreed that inventors should have full rights to their inventions " but worried about the constitutionality of patents and that patents would delay the arrival of new inventions to the public .
And , he believed that the " abuse of frivolous patents is likely to cause more inconvenience than is countervail by those really useful . "
( As cited in McLaughlin , 1998 ) . "
Note here that Jefferson was well aware the patents provided a monopoly to inventors .
He knew precisely what " exclusive right " meant to both inventors and to the public .
He was concerned about the exclusive right .
( 3 ) Jefferson , always the scientist , warmed to his duties and became more open to the idea of patents when he saw how many inventors put forth their ideas as a result of the new system of protection , claiming that " it had given spring to invention beyond my conception . "
( As cited in Malone , 1951 ) . ( 4 ) This bill [ referring to the 1836 patent bill ] was the basis of our patent system until contemporary times .
Jefferson 's hand and influence giving protection to the inventor but access to the user , as well as the utility of the invention are still benchmarks of the United States Patent Office .
He truly , should be recognized as a " Father of Invention . "
( 5 ) " Jefferson 's rationale for requiring filing and publication of the patent certificate in every judicial district was to give the public " notice of the thing invented . . . in terms sufficient to point out the general nature thereof , and to warn others against an interference therewith . "
From http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:c2ZUAn-1DRcJ:etext.virginia.edu/journals/EH/EH40/walter40.html+%22thomas+jefferson%22+opinion+of+patents&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us
Note that Jefferson again was clear regarding the rights of inventors . ( 6 ) " The Act of 1793 was materially different from the bill Jefferson had proposed , although it did contain a number of the new provisions he had sought .
Specifically , patents would henceforth issue on payment of a set fee into the Treasury ; the petition would be for an exclusive property right in the invention ... " ibid .
Interestingly , one single provision of the Act of 1793 appears to have caused Jefferson to return to his earlier opinion regarding the dangers of patents .
After all the effort that Jefferson expended in getting a patent act passed , and balancing the needs of society with the rights of the individual , the Act of 1793 became an act of registration rather than an act of examination , and the result was the patents were automatically granted , which Jefferson thought was wrong .
Jefferson knew that the automatic granting of patents would cause unnecessary lawsuits and would reduce the benefit of new inventions .
It also appears that Jefferson may have been at least partially responsible for turning the act into one of registration rather than examination , but I am unsure about that .
Jefferson was initially opposed to patents .
Later , he became a supporter when he realized the number of inventions being revealed quickly that would benefit society faster than if patents did not exist .
However , after the Patent Act of 1793 , Jefferson returned to being opposed to patents .
Fortunately , the Patent Act of 1793 was replaced by the Act of 1836 , which returned the requirements for examination and made obtaining a patent much more difficult .
I am sure Jefferson would have approved .

Lonnie , your nonsense is just as unbelievable when you post as " anonymous " as when you sign your name to it , so anonymity ( or sockpuppetry -- yes , I * can * read your mind !
I can see the rusty gears turning ) wo n't help you in your futile endeavor to convert the people at this site into patent - loving wackos .
Thomas Jefferson , in particular , was indisputably patent - hostile .
In particular , he penned this : " If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property , it is the action of the thinking power called an idea , which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself ; but the moment it is divulged , it forces itself into the possession of every one , and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it .
Its peculiar character , too , is that no one possesses the less , because every other possesses the whole of it .
He who receives an idea from me , receives instruction himself without lessening mine ; as he who lights his taper at mine , receives light without darkening me . "

Jefferson said he approved the Bill of Rights as far as it went , but would like to see the addition of an article specifying that " Monopolies may be allowed to person for their own productions in literature , and their own inventions in the arts , for a term not exceeding --- years , but for no longer term and for no other purpose . " [ Jefferson to James Madison , August 28 , 1789 , PTJ , 15:368 . ]
Silvio Bedini notes that in 1787 Jefferson 's opposition to monopoly in any form led him to oppose patents .
[ Silvio Bedini , " Godfather of American Invention , " Smithsonian Book of Invention , " ( Washington , D.C. : 1978 ) , 83 . ]
But by 1789 , Jefferson 's firm opposition had weakened .
Writing to James Madison , approved the Bill of Rights as far as it went , but , but for no longer term and for no other purpose . " [ Jefferson to James Madison , August 28 , 1789 , PTJ , 15:368 . ]
[ Comment at 08/20/2009 06:39 AM by Anonymous ]
Beeswax :
My apologies ... the letter you quoted was written after the passing of the Patent Act of 1793 , which again changed Jefferson 's mind regarding the value of patents .
Jefferson also said , in the same letter : " Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them [ inventions ] , as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which produce utility , but this may or may not be done , according to the will and convenience of the society , without claim or complaint from anybody . "
I also find the article " Who Cares What Thomas Jefferson Thought About Patents ?
Reevaluating the Patent ' Privilege ' in Historical Context " to be nicely objective in pointing out that patent law developed with guidance from natural rights objectives .
This same paper also provides a good discussion of the difference ( or lack thereof ) of patent privilege and patent rights .
[ Comment at 08/20/2009 07:02 AM by Anonymous ]
The proposal to add monopolies in the bill of rights amendment demonstrates Jefferson 's recognition that patents were unconstitutional .
How better to have patents recognised as distinct from the inventor 's natural exclusive right to their designs , by properly putting them in an amendment where they are clearly described as monopolies ?
That way , as with alcohol prohibition , the amendment can be rectified , and patents more easily abolished .
You can't abolish natural rights , but you can abolish privileges , monopolies .
While it should be clear that Jefferson recognised that the monopoly of patent was n't sanctioned by the constitution .
What may yet be argued is whether by adding them to the bill of rights he hoped to bolster their legitimacy , or sow the seeds for their abolition .
I suggest it was the latter .
Madison also recognised that patents were unconstitutional , hence why he declined the addition of monopolies to the bill of rights .
He knew the patent legislation would be undermined were it to be explicitly recognised as a monopoly instead of assumed to be the natural exclusive right recognised by the constitution .
Madison knew as well as Jefferson , that the constitution could n't explicitly give congress the power to grant monopolies , but then that would also apply to an amendment ( which would thus be short - lived , taking patents with it ) .
Hence the only reason for adding monopolies to the bill of rights was to enable them to be repealed .
An accurate timeline of any evidence for Jefferson 's support of patent legislation ( as opposed to efficient administration ) , could shed light either way - as to Jefferson 's motives .
I 'll check out that ' Who Cares ' article .

[ Comment at 08/20/2009 09:30 AM by Crosbie Fitch ]
Crosbie :
You bring up a point I had not previously considered , that Jefferson set up patents so that they could be easily removed from the system .
However , considering his remarks from the era , that makes sense .
He said that patents [ and copyrights , I think ] should be monitored to assure they would not be abused .
It is unquestionable that Jefferson , regardless of whether he was supporting patents or arguing against them , was always concerned about them and their potential for abuse .
He especially railed against the passage of the 1793 Act , which essentially rubber - stamped patents .
I should also point out that while Jefferson recognized that the possibility of gaining patents might motivate some inventors ( he was unconvinced until he saw how the initiation of the patent system seemed to achieve a positive , beneficial response ) , he did not personally believe patents were necessary .
This difference seems at odds , but I do understand it .
He supported patents because of the societal benefit of patents , but he was not personally motivated by them .
It takes a great individual to place his personal beliefs second in favor of a system that seemed to have a chance to motivate others to take action - in this case invent or write .
The articles I linked to above ( let me know if any of the links do not work - I will see what I can do ) , clearly indicate that " natural rights " were in fact integral to development of the first patent laws .
I find the link between " natural rights " and patent law interesting , since modern interpreters of " natural rights " seem to think they are antithetical , or at least incompatible .
However , it is clear that when patent laws were being developed that " natural rights " were integral to the development .
Interesting reading .
It is nice to see there is at least one person on this site with an open mind .

" ... our laws , indeed , our society , has deemed that such contracts are in fact inheritable ... "
I 'm not sure I understand your beliefs .
Are you suggesting that when my grandfather was bound by a mutually and voluntarily agreed contract that he should give 2 tons of apples to a particular family and he gave them only one , am I bound by the same contract and required to get one more ton of apples for them or the alternative is to move a certain distance away from the family and then I 'm no longer bound by the contract ?
[ Comment at 08/20/2009 12:44 PM by Samuel Hora ]
Samuel : Interesting question .
The answer depends on who inherited you grandfather 's assets .
Under most laws , contracts entered into prior to the death of an individual are generally enforceable on the executor or on the heirs , unless there is a provision in the contract that would exempt performance .
Such an exemption would automatically occur for a service , such as a hair cut , but for delivery of product , the contract would usually remain in place .
The requirement would be irrelevant of where the heirs or executor lived , unless they went outside the jurisdiction , which may be a country , but many and perhaps most contracts are enforceable across national lines .
Indeed , contracts are more binding from that viewpoint than intellectual property , since intellectual property is restricted to specific geographic regions , and contracts may not be .
I am sure I am missing details because you have asked a complex question and I am not an attorney .
Mr. Kinsella could provide much more detail , I am sure .
Does that answer your question ?
[ Comment at 08/20/2009 02:23 PM by Anonymous ]
No .
From what you 've said until now it seems to me that your beliefs are based on some interesting ideas , eg. " mandatory contract heritage " and " regional / spatial contract validity " which enable you to claim that it is possible to bind those that are yet to born .
I 'm not aware that Mr. Kinsella would claim the things you did , so you should be more able to explain your beliefs than he could explain your beliefs .
" * sigh *
We are going in circles .
Let me try again . " -
You showed that a libertarian newborn would be outcast from some kind of a twisted fascist society simply because of difference in beliefs .
You did not show what or how anything " questions whether Libertarian principles can ever be valid " .
[ Comment at 08/20/2009 10:25 PM by Samuel Hora ]
Samuel : So , the United States is a " twisted fascist society " because newcomers are not permitted , by law , to be communists or to create a dictatorship ?
Is that what you are saying ?
Libertarian principles , as I understand them , are frequently contrary to the laws passed by the will of the people ( though laws are proposed by the legislature , the members of the legislature are directly elected and are presumed to act in the best interests of the people - though we know that is not always true ) .
What I am saying is that a newcomer will not be permitted to act against the established laws of a society .
Since " pure " Libertarianism is contrary to established law , and since it is unlikely the laws will be changed to accommodate Libertarians , it appears the Libertarians will either be perpetually frustrated in their desire to practice their beliefs , or will need to found a society where those beliefs may be practiced .
How difficult is this concept to understand ?
lol ... Though I would not have used the phrase " mandatory contract heritage , " I suppose it could be described as that .
Contracts do live on .
Examples surround us .
Let us take an extremely simple example .
A person purchases a home on contract .
In the will of that person , the person leaves all worldly possessions to one or more immediate heirs , though they are yet to be born .
An heir is born .
The person dies , leaving the contract in place .
Now , the heir has one of two options .
The heir is able to accept the terms of the contract , in which case the assets bound in the home , along with the obligation to continue payment on the contract , or to create a substitute contract , will be passed on to the heir .
Certainly the heir can refuse the contract , but the heir will also risk a great likelihood that any portion of the house already paid will no longer pass on to the heir - or a lower amount will pass on to the heir .
So , in this case the heir could continue to the terms of the contract and reap the benefits therefrom , or the heir could ignore the contract and lose some or all of the benefits of the contract .
Another simple example .
A corporation is chartered .
Ten employees make up the original company .
When a newcomer joins the corporation , the newcomer does so knowing the charter of the company and rules of the company , which the newcomer is bound to accept as a member of that corporation .
If the newcomer does not like the rules , the newcomer has one of two choices .
The newcomer may attempt to change the rules - which is possible , or the newcomer can find some place else to go .
Life is very simple .
Now , you may consider the following example somewhat extreme , but it is reflective of the array of societies on our planet .
Let us say that someone is born in France .
Let us say that the newcomer believes that there are wrongs that may be committed against a person so severe that murder is permissible .
However , as we know , murder is impermissible in France .
The newcomer has two choices .
Either change the law so that murder is permissible in some circumstances , or move to a society where murder may be committed in certain circumstances to avenge a wrong committed against that person or the family of that person .
Several such societies exist on this planet , so options are available to that person .
Is the newcomer required to abide by a " mandatory contract heritage " ?
If the person plan on remaining in France , yes .
In fact , we all have " mandatory contract heritage " that we are required , by law , to abide by , or we risk fines , imprisonment , and in some cases , death .

An anonymous coward wrote : " Jefferson recognized that the possibility of gaining patents might motivate some inventors ( he was unconvinced until he saw how the initiation of the patent system seemed to achieve a positive , beneficial response ) "
What he saw was an inevitable land - grab that proves nothing .
Later inventors were hindered rather than helped , because they had to build on already - patented prior work , unlike those involved in the initial gold rush .
This is discussed in greater detail in Against Intellectual Monopoly .
Of course , there have been far more inventors in the centuries since that gold rush than there were during it , simply because the rush was a much briefer period of time , and furthermore population has grown ( exponentially ) since then .

I 'm not educated about how exactly heritage works nowdays , but it seems unjust to me to force someone to inherit property and debts of someone else even when he does n't want it .
I also fail to see how refusing to enter into a contract ( and thus not working for the corporation from your example ) or not accepting a heritage ( and thus not being able to live in the house ) is analogous to being forced to going away a certain distance from those who 's contract offer is being rejected .
I agree that if a group of people owns a land , the " newcomer " can't stay on their land if he does n't accept their contract .
That seems to me to be compatible with libertarianism .
However if one of the people decides to sell him some land even without agreeing with that " global " contract , I do n't see a way how he can be justly forced to go away or accept their " global " contract or suffer violent coercion .
" So , the United States is a " twisted fascist society " because newcomers are not permitted , by law , to be communists or to create a dictatorship ?
Is that what you are saying ? "
You provided an example of a " society " that seem quite fascist to me .
If USA indeed prohibited simply holding some beliefs , then that would mean I would have to think about it as fascist .
But our discussion was not about holding beliefs , it was about being able to own oneself and some property .
You seem to be claiming that if some group of people were in contract with each other that they cannot exclusively and fully control their bodies and some land or property ( btw is n't that communism ? ) and there would somehow appear a newcomer among them with some property or land , they would have a just right to confiscate his property and deprive him of his self - ownership or else he can go " away " ?
( what distance ? ) .
I do n't believe that .
No one has the right to own somebody else even if 99 % of the other people expressed their desire to be his slaves .
If you can't accept that a person owns himself and is able to own a property then of course you can't accept liberty .

Samuel : A belief is different than a practice .
You may believe in ritual murder in the United States , if you like , so long as you do not practice ritual murder .
Beliefs are a lovely thing - just be sure that you do not practice them if they violate laws .
You are not " required " to accept land - which might , emphasize might , allow you to avoid accepting the debt .
Conversely , refusing to accept the land would also prevent you from obtaining any benefits that might accrue from owning the land .
I agree that if a group of people owns a land , the " newcomer " can't stay on their land if he does n't accept their contract .
That seems to me to be compatible with libertarianism .
However if one of the people decides to sell him some land even without agreeing with that " global " contract , I do n't see a way how he can be justly forced to go away or accept their " global " contract or suffer violent coercion .
Yet , is this not the condition of citizenship ?
Are you not required to accept the " contract " of the nation in which you live ?
If you are saying that you need not accept that contract , meaning that you are free to run red lights and stop signs , go as fast as you wish , regardless of the speed limits set , even drive when society has stated that to drive you must hold a license , then I must respectfully disagree .
How can a society exist without the common contract that binds all members of the society together ?

Beeswax :
What he saw was an inevitable land - grab that proves nothing .
Later inventors were hindered rather than helped , because they had to build on already - patented prior work , unlike those involved in the initial gold rush .
This is discussed in greater detail in Against Intellectual Monopoly .
This statement is your interpretation of things that is without evidences .
I have read " Against Intellectual Monopoly , " and find the same flawed statements of opinion , that are supported by some anecdotal evidence , but there is just as much anecdotal proof of the value of patents .
I am unconvinced by mere statements of belief and position rather than actual statistical evidence .
" It is nice to see there is at least one person on this site with an open mind . "
I suspect this is intended to imply that I 'm not one .
None of the nasty things that you have said or implied about me are at all true .

You should not be so paranoid .
Indeed , I fail to see how I could have said anything nasty about you because I was not talking about you at all .

" Yet , is this not the condition of citizenship ?... " " citizenship " and " nation " in the sense you 're using them are a hallmark of oppression , slavery , fascism or communism or other nasty - isms , because they act not as a contract but rather a violent rule .
It is possible for a group of people to live without that and yet be free and have " order " among themselves ( using true contracts ) .
Have n't you read the unofficial " set texts " ? :)
Mr. Kinsella , it might be a good idea to allow commenting on this site only after one passes a simple " test " of knowledge of a provided short reading list ( maybe wikipedia articles would suffice . )
Otherwise some people try to act as if they knew nothing about the principles and even the possibility of freedom . :)

Samuel :
It seems as though we are back where we started .
What you are fundamentally saying is that all governments are oppressive , fascist , etc .
As I previously attempted to point out , what that means is that under all present regimes Libertarianism is not possible .
When you are born or move into a society , under the present rules of all societies , you are required to observe the covenants established by the people of that society .
You may call these contracts or covenants oppressive or whatever , but they are the rules we live by .
I personally think your position is extreme and unrealistic .
No , I have not read the unofficial " set texts , " and neither am I interested in reading them .
I have already read many fictional stories and unless there is something of interest to commend them to me I will pass .
Incidentally , I find your reaction to my comments interesting .
I present positions that you apparently do not understand or oppose , and your immediate reaction is to violently oppress me by calling for my posts to be blocked .
Good job .
Some Libertarian you are .

1 . ) I said nothing about blocking anyone 's posts .
Anybody is able to read a few articles and fill out a simple " test " .

You really need to read something about libertarianism before you use the word again ;)
You 're needlessly ridiculing yourself :)

Samuel :
You clearly stated that posting should not be permitted , i.e. , blocked , until after someone has passed a simple test .
It was not that long ago that such " tests " were used to prevent African Americans from voting in this country .
Such tests have been well established to be violent oppression .
As for " protecting " one 's property , doing so with an intent to suppress free speech is clearly anti-freedom , and almost assuredly anti-Libertarian .
I am sure you understand these basic concepts .
Until you understand what freedom , censorship and oppression are , you should not use those terms .
You are most assuredly ridiculing yourself .

" ... prevent African Americans from voting ... " - was n't there a time when this was the will of " the people " and any newcomer was bound to obey these rules , otherwise he was considered a criminal ? " ... suppress free speech ... " - do you let strangers in your house and let them write on your walls or do you oppress and censor their speech ?

Samuel : " ... prevent African Americans from voting ... " - was n't there a time when this was the will of " the people " and any newcomer was bound to obey these rules , otherwise he was considered a criminal ?
About ten states , all southern , and mostly smaller states from a population viewpoint at the time the tests were in force , had literacy tests .
So , if less than 10 % of the population of a nation are under such laws , does that constitute the will of the people ?
Since the Federal government eventually deemed that these laws were illegal under the consitution , bolstered by the Civil Rights Act , it hardly seems that the laws were legal in the first place .
Of course , that meant that enforcing those illegal laws made the enforcers criminals .
But , yes , the rules had to be obeyed in those ten states until they were ruled illegal .
" ... suppress free speech ... " - do you let strangers in your house and let them write on your walls or do you oppress and censor their speech ?
On the other hand , if I had a meeting hall and invited people to come speak , most of whom would likely be strangers , would it be reasonable to prevent those with dissenting viewpoints to speak , regardless of how well informed they were ?
Those in attendance would recognize the limits of knowledge of that person , and conversely , the breadth of knowledge , and weight that person 's speech accordingly .
Of course , if I was only interested in mindless yes men who only parroted what I believed , then I would set up a " literacy test " to keep out the unwanted elements , thereby violently suppressing liberty of dissenters in what was supposed to be a meeting hall .
But then , my actions would clearly show I was opposed to liberty .
As for inviting strangers in my house , I believe it is a given that strangers and friends alike should not be writing on the walls in my house .
On the other hand , all are free to write on the 2 meter by 3 meter sheets of paper set up for that purpose - regardless of their viewpoint and regardless of whether I agree with them .

The largest of several earthquakes in the South Pacific recently
Story from USGS
An earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter Scale occurred off the south west coast of New Zealand at 45.721 °S , 166.643°E 8:22:32 PM
at epicenter .
( 05:22:32 AM ( EDT ) – Eastern Daylight )
This is the 18th earthquake measuring 4.0 or greater in the area since July 9 , 2009 .
The area has been seismically active for hundreds of years .
In 1883 the Indonesian island of Krakatoa erupted with 15,000 times the force of the first atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima .
A tsunami warning has been issued for the coast of Australia including Sydney .
No news of a tsunami has been noted .
No warning has been issued for the US West Coast or Alaska .
At 2:23 AM Pacific Daylight Time on July 15 , an earthquake with preliminary magnitude 7.8
occurred off the west coast of South Island , New Zealand .
( Refer to the United States Geological
Survey for official earthquake parameters . )
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach , Hawaii will issue a tsunami warning for regions near the epicenter .
USGS
The epicenter is at an ocean depth of 21.7 miles .
Local distances from the epicentre are 150 km ( 95 miles ) WNW of Invercargill , New Zealand , 175 km ( 110 miles ) WSW of Queenstown , New Zealand and 825 km ( 510 miles ) SW of WELLINGTON , New Zealand .
The Hawaii - based Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued a warning , saying : “ An earthquake of this size has the potential to generate a destructive tsunami that can strike coastlines in the region near the epicentre within minutes to hours . ”

July 4th is a day that will always elicit strong emotions of respect , gratitude , and pride .
It will always be remembered as the day that we stood up and said “ Enough ! ”
The freedoms we enjoy in this land are n’t free .
They were hard - fought and won through the blood of true patriots .
When faced with the prospect of an occupying force , America chose to fight .
We chose the path of righteousness and self - respect .
We chose the path of freedom .
Many years have passed since that fateful day , but who can forget it .
The rockets red glare .
The bombs bursting in air .
And the terror we all felt as the enemy ships approached our major cities .
At first we all believed that a diplomatic solution could be found .
We reached out with an olive branch and found it trampled under our enemy ’s feet as they progressed forward , stealing from us what was never rightfully theirs .
This land was our land–we settled here , made this place our own , and built an honest society based on family values and mutual respect .
On this day , we remember the heroes of the war .
Captain Stephen
Hiller whose courage and quick thinking literally saved the human race .
David Levinson , a mild mannered cable - company tech consultant whose expertise allowed us to beat our enemies at their own game .
And let us never forget the heroics of President Whitmore , who not only oversaw the coordination of the worldwide global counterattack against the alien race , but also had the fortitude and dedication to man a fighter jet and defend this country he loved so much … only hours after the tragic death of his beloved wife , Marilyn .
They ’re heroes , and they ’re patriots .
The history books will be filled with their exploits , their doubts , their fears , and their triumphs .
Today , though , I ’d like to draw your attention to a lesser known hero .
His sacrifice , while well documented , has been lost to the masses among the tales of countless others around the world .
His story is familiar , and his bravery unmatched .
Russell Casse was born in Reno , Nevada in 1950 .
The son of Caleb and Henrietta , Russell was named after his Grandfather , Russell T. Casse , whose deeds in the First World War are well known .
Caleb , unfortunately , was a gambler and a drinker , a trait that Russell would inherate .
After dropping out of high school , Russell left his abusive family and lived a nomadic lifestyle , wandering from city to city .
It was n’t until the Vietnam conflict that Casse joined the US Military , finding his true calling as a fighter pilot .
After the war , Russell met Sandra Temple and the two had three children .
She died of breast cancer in 1989 .
After this , Russell began drinking heavily and took up crop dusting to make ends meet for his broken family .
It was also around this time that Russell found himself one of the first victims of the intergalactic aggressors as they abducted and studied the war hero in order to gain a tactical advantage for their impending invasion .
For a man who had lost so much and endured such tragedy , the First Intergalactic War of 1996 came as no shock .
Fleeing the mile - wide space ships that cast clouds of doom over our cities , Russell found his way to the Area 51 Army base … the base , we now know , where President Whitmore coordinated the wildly successful human counter - attack .
With his flight experience , Russell saw it as his duty to step up once again to defend his country .
He fought bravely in the Battle of Area 51 , and when all others had exhausted their supply of missiles , it was Russell Casse who had the foresight to spare his ammo .
It was Russell Casse whose combat training gave us the opportunity to render one of their destroyers inoperable , thereby saving thousands , if not millions , of lives .
Fate intervened , and the missile failed to launch .
Instead of backing down and cowering in defeat , Casse stepped up .
“ Tell my children … I love them very much . ”
Those were Russell Casse ’s last recorded words before he severed communication with control and flew his plane , missile armed , directly into the main weapon of the alien destroyer .
He gave his life for race , country , and family .
Russell Casse ’s sacrifice echoes the sacrifice of those countless thousands around the globe who saved our freedoms … our dignity … our very lives .
Today , let us remember Russell Casse and those like him .
Let us remember the great fireballs of death that engulfed New York , Los Angeles , and Washington D.C. before turning their sites on the annihilation of the human race .
Let us remember the mistakes we made , the prejudices we were forced to overcome , and the strength of our human resolve .
And let us remember the words of our President … words captured only through the microphone of a handheld tape recorder because there was no media to report .
It ’s been thirteen years , but his words still bring tears to the eyes of every freedom - loving American .
The battle has been fought and won .
We will remain forever vigilant , staring at the skies and preparing ourselves for the next time we must defend our planet from tentacled monsters .
We will be ready , and we will be victorious .
“ In less than an hour , aircraft from here will join others from around the world .
And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind .
“ Mankind . ”
That word should have new meaning for all of us today .
We ca n’t be consumed by our petty differences anymore .
We will be united in our common interests .
Perhaps it ’s fate that today is the Fourth of July , and you will once again be fighting for our freedom …
Not from tyranny , oppression , or persecution … but from annihilation .
We are fighting for our right to live .
To exist .
And should we win the day , the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday , but as the day the world declared in one voice : “ We will not go quietly into the night ! ”
We will not vanish without a fight !
We ’re going to live on !
We ’re going to survive !
Today we celebrate our Independence Day ! ”
- President Thomas Whitmore , July 4 , 1996
Russell Casse , 1950 - 1996
It turns out ants , like humans , are true farmers .
The difference is that ants are farming fungus .
Entomologists Ted Schultz and Seán Brady at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of Natural History have been providing new insight into the agricultural abilities of ants and how these abilities have evolved throughout time .
Using DNA sequencing , the scientists were able to construct an " evolutionary tree " of fungus - growing ants , which revealed a single pioneering ancestor that discovered agriculture approximately 50 million years ago .
In the past 25 million years , four different specialized agricultural systems have evolved , leading to the most recently evolved and best - known fungus - growing ant species - -" leaf - cutter ants . "
The ants do not eat the leaves ; they grow their fungus gardens on them and then eat the fungus .
By studying the agricultural evolution of leaf - cutter ants , as well as various other species , scientists may be able to develop improved human agricultural and medical methods .
" Agriculture is very rare in the animal world , " said Schultz .
" We only know of four animal groups that have discovered agriculture : ants , termites , bark beetles and humans .
By studying certain fungus - growing ants , which our study indicates are almost like ' living fossils , ' we might be able to better understand steps involved in the evolution of ant agriculture . "
To complete their research , scientists spent more than 15 years assembling a comprehensive array of specimens , which included 91 ant species , 65 of which were fungus - growing ant species representing all different groups of fungus - growing ants .
Researchers then used DNA sequencing , combined with a variety of state - of - the - art computer algorithms , to construct an evolutionary tree of fungus - growing ants .
Dominican amber fungus - growing ant fossils were used to calibrate time intervals on the evolutionary tree .
From this evolutionary tree , scientists were able to determine that fungus - growing ants are all descended from a common ancestor that pioneered agriculture 50 million years ago during a period of global warming .
The researchers also determined that in the past 25 million years , four different specialized agricultural systems emerged .
Each of these systems has its own unique set of cultivated fungi .
For example , approximately 20 million years ago one group of fungus - growing ants discovered " higher agriculture , " meaning they cultivated their fungi to produce specialized " fruits " that the ants would harvest and eat for food .
Leaf - cutter ants , which belong to this group , originated recently - - less than 10 million years ago .
Finally , it also was discovered that there are certain fungus - growing ant species living in South America today that are " missing links " in evolution .
This research was published in the March 24 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Congratulations to the Voice of Young Science Network , a part of Sense About Science , whose open letter to the World Health Organization has received a response .
The letter , which is available here , called for the body to issue a clear international statement regarding the use of homeopathy in the developing world .
The WHO has done exactly that , and made it explicitly clear that where homeopathy is used as a preventative or treatment for HIV , TB , influenza , malaria and infant diarrhoea , lives are at risk .
The office of Dr. Margaret Chan , Director - General of the WHO , has stated that the following responses “ clearly express the WHO ’s position ” :
Dr Mario Raviglione , Director , Stop TB Department , WHO : “ Our evidence - based WHO TB treatment / management guidelines , as well as the International Standards of Tuberculosis Care ( ISTC ) do not recommend use of homeopathy . ”
Dr Mukund Uplekar , TB Strategy and Health Systems , WHO : “ WHO ’s evidence - based guidelines on treatment of tuberculosis … have no place for homeopathic medicines . ”
Dr Teguest Guerma , Director Ad Interim , HIV / AIDS Department , WHO : “ The WHO Dept. of HIV / AIDS invests considerable human and financial resources [ … ] to ensure access to evidence - based medical information and to clinically proven , efficacious , and safe treatment for HIV …
Let me end by congratulating the young clinicians and researchers of Sense About Science for their efforts to ensure evidence - based approaches to treating and caring for people living with HIV . ”
Dr Sergio Spinaci , Associate Director , Global Malaria Programme , WHO : “ Thanks for the amazing documentation and for whistle blowing on this issue …
The Global Malaria programme recommends that malaria is treated following the WHO Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria . ” Joe Martines , on behalf of Dr Elizabeth Mason , Director , Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Development , WHO : “ We have found no evidence to date that homeopathy would bring any benefit to the treatment of diarrhoea in children …
Homeopathy does not focus on the treatment and prevention of dehydration – in total contradiction with the scientific basis and our recommendations for the management of diarrhoea . ”
Cue the quacks and their attitude to science , which – given the above , is best described as TLDR .
Dr. Sarah Holmes , president of the UK’s Faculty of Homeopathy , has said that “ further research and investment into homeopathy ” is needed .
Paula Ross , chief executive of the Society of Homeopaths , said that Sense About Science has “ failed to do its homework , ” mentioning that there is “ a strong and growing evidence base for homeopathy , ” and that the letter to the WHO was “ just another poorly wrapped attempt to discredit homeopathy by Sense About Science . ”
It ’s alright Paula , we do n’t need Sense About Science to discredit homeopathy .
Your society ’s intellectual dishonesty in the name of exploiting the vulnerable has got it covered .

A journalist arrested in Sudan for wearing trousers has become a symbol for women 's rights across Africa .
AS THE morality police crowded around her table in a Khartoum restaurant to see what she was wearing , Lubna Hussein had no idea that she was about to become a symbol for womens rights in Sudan .

She had arrived at the Kawkab Elsharq Hall on a Friday night to book a cousins wedding party .
She left less than an hour later under arrest as a trouser girl  humiliated in front of hundreds of people , then beaten around the head in a police van before she was hauled before a court to face a likely sentence of 40 lashes for the sin of not wearing traditional Islamic dress .
The officials who tried to humiliate her expected her to beg for mercy , as most of their victims do .
Navy engineers are n't the only ones who can jam sonar .
Scientists have discovered a species of tiger moth that thwarts hungry bats by emitting extra -loud clicks to block the bats ' ability to echolocate .
Researchers have long known that some species of moths send out clicks in response to bat sonar , but until now , no one has been able to prove that the clicks actually interfere with echolocation .
" The idea of a jamming mechanism has been thrown around for 50 years , but nobody has really put a moth and a bat together in a flight room to see what happens , " said ecology graduate student Aaron Corcoran of Wake Forest University , co-author of the study published Thursday in Science .
Corcoran and his colleagues pitted a particularly noisy species of tiger moth , the Bertholdia trigona , against big brown bats trained to hunt in a flight room .
As long as the moths were able to click , the bats could n't catch them , even though the moths were tethered on a string .
But when the scientists pierced a small hole in the moths ' sound - producing structures , called tymbals , the silenced moths quickly became lunch .
" It 's the first good , solid case of this going on , " said insect behavior expert James Fullard of the University of Toronto at Mississauga , who was not involved in the study .
" For this bat and this moth , it looks pretty convincing that jamming is what 's going on . "
Not all clicking moths can jam sonar , Fullard said , and that 's part of what makes this discovery so exciting .
Previous research revealed that two other varieties of tiger moth make clicks that are too quiet to interfere with bat echolocation .
Instead , he said , these moths likely use the clicks as a warning :
Because most moths that click back at bats are poisonous , scientists think the noise may communicate , " Do n't eat me , I taste bad . "
But B. trigona is n't poisonous , and the Wake Forest researchers experimented with young bats that had no prior exposure to clicking moths , so they had n't already learned to equate clicking with a bad taste .
Nor did it seem like the bats were just startled by the clicking moths .
Even after multiple attempts on multiple nights , the bats still could n't catch the intact B. trigona .
" Mammals habituate to startle rather quickly , " Corcoran said .
" We went through seven days of trials , but the bats never habituated .
They were put off by the clicks right away and throughout the whole experiment . "
The researchers have n't yet proven how the moth 's sonar - jamming mechanism works , but they have two leading hypotheses :
The moth 's clicks may act as false echoes , essentially making the bat " see " double , or they may interrupt the bat 's own echoes , making its prey appear closer than it is .
Unlike other moths , B. trigona appears to be particularly suited for jamming sonar because it can make up to 4,500 clicks per second .
Near - constant noise is important because it prevents a bat from hearing the echoes of its own sonar clicks .
" If the timing is just right , if a click arrives in the two millisecond window shortly before the arrival of a real echo , it 's going to throw off the ranging software of the bat , " said echolocation expert Bill Conner , who led the project .
" That ’s why this animal , we think , evolved sounds that cover all of acoustic time .
If you listen to the recordings , the moths produce clicks all of the time , and that greatly increases the probability that some clicks will fall into that precise time window . "
The group first spotted the noisy B. trigona in a cloud forest in Ecuador , but they were particularly excited to discover the moth as far north as Arizona .
To search for evidence of sonar jamming outside the lab , the researchers have now set up a field station in the Chiricahua National Monument of southeast Arizona , where 18 species of bats interact with more than 30 kinds of tiger moths , including B. trigona .
" There will always be some researchers who will say , ' Well you ’ve proven that you can jam sonar in the laboratory , but does it really happen in the field ? ' "
Conner said .
" That ’s the reason for the follow - up . "

No radios for two stages at the 2009 Tour .
Photo : Patrick O’Grady
Organizers of the Tour de France said Friday they will conduct “ a safety experiment ” in next month ’s race by banning the use of rider radios on two stages .
The measure will affect the Limoges - Issoudun stage on July 14 and the Vittel - Colmar stage on July 17 .
The steps mean that team managers will have to revert to communicating with racers by relying upon more traditional methods .
The rules may also place greater emphasis on planning and pre-race strategy meetings , once - critical elements that have lost some of their importance since the 1990s when teams began employing lightweight radios to allow in - race communication between team directors and riders .
“ This measure is not being imposed by the Tour de France but represents the application of the existing French Highway Code , ” Tour sporting director Jean - Francois Pescheux told AFP .
“ It is aimed at preventing something dramatic happening one day . ”
In another measure , staff traveling in team support cars will no longer be allowed to watch TV coverage of the race , Tour officials said .
Some advocates of radios and in - car televisions have said the two help warn riders of possible safety issues .
Others have suggested radios cause as many problems as they solve .
Pescheux said adequate warnings exist with or without radios .
“ In the case of an emergency affecting the course , such as a street demonstration or a roadside fire , we have in the past been able to warn the
riders very quickly , ” Pescheux said .
The French Gendarmerie , said Pescheux , are also trained to signal potential hazards to the cyclists .

Flaws in the Vegan Bible
The year 2006 marked an event that rocked the world of nutrition ( as well as the walls of Whole Foods ) : the release of The China Study by T. Colin Campbell .
Printed by a small publishing company known for other scientific masterpieces such as The Psychology of the Simpsons and You Do Not Talk About Fight Club , Campbell ’s book quickly hit the word - of - mouth circuit and skyrocketed towards bestseller status , with sales exceeding half a million copies to date .
The premise is that all animal foods — ranging from Chicken McNuggets to a fillet of wild - caught salmon — are responsible for modern ailments like heart disease and cancer .
Such diseases , the book claims , can generally be prevented or even cured by shunning animal products and eating a diet of whole , unprocessed plant foods instead .
Although this startling thesis was hard for some to swallow , the book appeared credible due to its exhaustive references and the author ’s laundry list of credentials — including a PhD from Cornell , authorship of over three hundred scientific papers , and decades of direct research experience .
Perhaps not surprisingly , The China Study was quickly absorbed into the vegan community as a bible of sorts — the final word on the harmfulness of animal foods , and indisputable proof that a plant - only diet is best for mankind .
To the exasperation of meat lovers everywhere ( especially those who enjoy arguing for sport ) , once lively debates with vegans were now extinguished with one simple phrase : Just read The China Study !
But despite the book ’s black - and - white declarations about animal products — and its seemingly well - referenced arguments —
The China Study is not a work of scientific vigor .
As we ’ll see in this article , the book ’s most widely repeated claims , particularly involving Campbell ’s cancer research and the results of the China - Cornell - Oxford Project , are victims of selection bias , cherry picking , and woefully misrepresented data .
Does Animal Protein Cause Cancer ?
The seeds of animal - food doubt were first planted early in Campbell ’s career , while he was working in the Philippines on a project to help combat malnutrition .
A colleague informed him of a startling trend : liver cancer was plaguing affluent Filipinos at a much higher rate than their less - wealthy counterparts — a phenomenon that , despite a slew of other lifestyle differences , Campbell believed was linked to their higher intake of animal protein .
1
Bolstering his suspicions , Campbell also learned of a recent study from India showing that a high protein intake spurred liver cancer in rats , while a low protein intake seemed to prevent it .
2
Intrigued by this gem of little - known research , Campbell decided to investigate the role of nutrition in cancer growth himself — an endeavor that ended up lasting several decades and producing over one hundred publications ( none of which pertained to Fight Club ) .
3
The China Study relayed Campbell ’s findings with powerful simplicity .
In a series of experiments , Campbell and his team exposed rats to very high levels of aflatoxin — a carcinogen produced by mold that grows on peanuts and corn — and then fed them a diet containing varying levels of the milk protein casein .
In study after study , the rats eating only 5 percent of their total calories as casein remained tumor - free , while the rats eating 20 percent of their calories as casein developed abnormal growths that marked the beginning of liver cancer .
As Campbell described , he could control cancer in those rodents “ like flipping a light switch on and off , ” simply by altering the amount of casein they consumed .
4
Despite these provocative findings , Campbell was n’t ready to declare all protein a threat to public health and stamp the peanut butter aisle with Mr. Yuk stickers .
Animal protein , it turned out , seemed to be uniquely villainous .
In several of his experiments , when the aflatoxin - exposed rats were fed wheat protein or soy protein in place of casein , they did n’t develop any cancer — even at the 20 percent level that proved so detrimental with casein .5
It seemed that those plant proteins were not only PETA - approved , but also the least likely to turn rat livers into tumor factories .
These findings led Campbell to his firm and famous conclusion : that all animal protein — but not plant protein — could uniquely promote cancer growth .
Out with the steak , in with the tofu !
But as several critics have pointed out , 6,7 that proclamation required a few somersaults of logic ( and maybe some cartwheels of delusion ) .
The effects of casein — particularly isolated casein , separated from other components of dairy that often work synergistically — ca n’t be generalized to all forms of milk protein , much less all forms of animal protein .
An impressive number of studies shows that the other major milk protein , whey , consistently suppresses tumor growth rather than promoting it , likely due to its ability to raise glutathione levels .
8,9 Another of Campbell ’s own studies suggests that fish protein acts as a cancer - promoter when paired with corn oil , but not when paired with fish oil — highlighting the importance of dietary context ( and the neverending terribleness of vegetable oils ) .
10
And the kicker : one of Campbell ’s most relevant experiments — which sadly received no mention in The China Study — showed that when wheat gluten is supplemented with lysine to make a complete protein , it behaves exactly like casein to promote tumor growth .
11
This means that animal protein does n’t have some mystical ability to spur cancer by mere virtue of its origin in a sentient creature — just that a full spectrum of amino acids provide the right building blocks for growth , whether it be of malignant cells or healthy ones .
And as any vegan who ’s been asked “ Where do you get your protein ? ” for the eight hundredth time will answer , even a plant - only diet supplies complete protein through various mixtures of legumes , grains , nuts , vegetables , and other approved vegan fare .
Theoretically , a meal of rice and beans would provide the same so - called cancer - promoting amino acids that animal protein does .
Indeed , Campbell ’s experiments lose their relevance in the context of a normal , real - world diet opposed to the purified menu of casein , sugar , and corn oil his rats received .
But that ’s only the tip of the proteinaceous iceberg .
In his September 2010 article , “ The Curious Case of Campbell ’s Rats , ” 12 Chris Masterjohn ventured beyond the well lit pages of The China Study to explore the dark alleys of Campbell ’s publications firsthand .
And what he found regarding the low - protein rats was a far cry from the sunshine - and - lollipops descriptions we read in the book .
Although rats consuming a high - casein diet were indeed developing liver cancer as Campbell described , the ones in the low - casein groups — which were portrayed as downright bright - eyed and shiny - coated in The China Study — were suffering an even worse fate .
Campbell ’s research actually showed that a low - protein diet increases the acute toxicity of aflatoxin , resulting in cell genocide and premature death .
Because protein deficiency prevents the liver from successfully doing its detoxifying duties , less aflatoxin gets converted into cancer - causing metabolites , but the end result is massive ( and eventually deadly ) tissue damage .
Even the research from India that jump - started Campbell ’s interest in the diet - cancer link showed that rats on a low - casein diet were dying with disturbing frequency , while the high - protein rats — tumored as they may have been — were at least staying alive .
13 ( It ’s surprising , then , that The China Study promotes a plant - based diet to prevent cancer , when death is equally effective and requires fewer shopping trips . )
More clues for understanding the casein - cancer research come from another Indian study — this one published in the late 1980s , and examining the effects of protein in aflatoxin - exposed monkeys instead of rats .
14 As with Campbell ’s experiments , the monkeys were fed diets containing either 5 percent or 20 percent casein , but with one important difference : instead of being slammed with an astronomically ( and unrealistically ) high dose of aflatoxin , the monkeys were exposed to lower , daily doses — mimicking a real - world situation where aflatoxin is consumed frequently in small amounts from contaminated foods .
In a fabulous case of scientific switcheroo , this study showed that it was the low - protein monkeys who got cancer , while the high - protein monkeys rejoiced in their tumorlessness .
This apparent paradox highlights a major problem in Campbell ’s rat research : the level of aflatoxin exposure plays a critical role in how protein affects cancer growth .
When the aflatoxin dose is sky high , animals eating a low - protein diet do n’t get cancer because their cells are too busy dying en masse , while animals eating a higher protein diet are still consuming enough dietary building blocks for the growth of cells — whether healthy or cancerous .
When the aflatoxin dose is more moderate , animals eating a low - protein diet develop cancer while their higher - protein counterparts remain in mighty fine health .
In a nutshell , the animal protein fear - mongering in The China Study stems from wildly misconstrued science .
What Campbell ’s rat experiments really showed was n’t that animal protein is a vengeful macronutrient of doom , but the following :
1. High - quality protein promotes cell growth no matter where it comes from ;
2. Protein deficiency thwarts the liver ’s ability to detoxify dangerous substances ; and
3 . With more realistic doses of aflatoxin , protein is actually tremendously protective against cancer , while protein - restricted diets prove harmful .
Did the Real China Study Show That Animal Foods Are Associated With Disease ?
The China Study only devotes one chapter to its namesake study , but that does n’t mean it ’s not a doozy .
Also known as the China - Cornell - Oxford Project , the China Study was an enormous epidemiological endeavor exploring diet and disease patterns in rural China — a project coined “ the Prix of epidemiology ” by the New York Times .
Spanning sixty - five counties and collecting data on a whopping three hundred sixty - seven variables , it generated over eight thousand statistically significant correlations between nutrition , lifestyle factors and a variety of diseases .
15
Although a project of such magnitude inevitably found some contradictory and non-causal links , Campbell asserts in his book that the data generally pointed in one direction : “ People who ate the most animal - based foods got the most chronic disease , ” and “ People who ate the most plant - based foods were the healthiest and tended to avoid chronic disease .
” 16 Although — as echoes through the hearts of statisticians everywhere — correlation does n’t equal causation , these associations in conjunction with Campbell ’s other research are supposed to make a compelling case for animal foods being legitimately harmful .
But were the results of the China Study really a sparkling endorsement for plant - based eating ?
It seems this conclusion is based , in large part , on unreliable blood variables rather than actual foods .
In his book , Campbell states that he and his research team “ found that one of the strongest predictors of Western diseases was blood cholesterol , ” 17 and proceeds to treat cholesterol as a proxy for animal food consumption .
Throughout this chapter , we learn that the China Study data found associations between cholesterol and many cancers , as well as cholesterol and animal protein intake — implying that animal protein and those same cancers must themselves be intimately linked .
But because blood cholesterol can be affected by a number of non-dietary factors and can even rise or fall as a result of disease , examining the relationship between food itself and health outcomes is likely to be more informative than using cholesterol as an overworked , fickle middleman .
But the direct relationship between animal protein and diseases is n’t discussed in The China Study for one monumental reason : that relationship does n’t exist .
An examination of the original China Study data shows virtually no statistically significant correlation between any type of cancer and animal protein intake .
18 Only fish protein correlates positively , but probably non-causally , with a small number of cancers : nasopharyngeal cancer , a rare disease that only strikes one out of every seven million people ; liver cancer , which shows up in fish - eating regions because aflatoxin proliferates in humid areas near water ; and leukemia , which is likely linked to other elements of the industrialized lifestyles associated with coastal regions ( and thus fish consumption ) in the China Study .
19
Ironically , when we look at plant protein — which The China Study argues so vigorously is cancer - protective — we find almost three times as many positive correlations with various cancers as we do with animal protein , including colon cancer , rectal cancer , and esophageal cancer .20 Likewise , for heart disease and stroke , plant protein has a positive correlation while animal protein and fish protein have negative or nearly neutral correlations — meaning the animal - food eaters in rural China , if anything , are getting less cardiovascular disease than their more vegetarian friends .
But matters get even more interesting when we look at some of the peer - reviewed papers generated by the China Study data , most of which are co-authored by Campbell himself .
As with the casein research , the China Study findings as described in Campbell ’s book are a hop , skip , and eighteen thousand jumps away from what the original research says .
Although wheat gets nary a mention in the China Study chapter , Campbell actually found that wheat consumption — in stark contrast to rice — was powerfully associated with higher insulin levels , higher triglycerides , coronary heart disease , stroke and hypertensive heart disease within the China Study data — far more so than any other food .
21,22 Likewise , in a paper from 1990 , Campbell conceded that “ neither plasma total cholesterol nor LDL cholesterol was associated with cardiovascular disease ” in the China Study data , and that “ geographical differences in cardiovascular disease mortality within China are caused primarily by factors other than dietary or plasma cholesterol ” — revealing that not even the beloved cholesterol middleman could live up to its heart - disease - causing accusations .
23
And in the spirit of saving the best for last , another of Campbell ’s own papers , published a mere two years before The China Study hit the shelves , states point - blank that — despite Campbell ’s claims about the superior health of the near - vegan rural Chinese — “ it is the largely vegetarian , inland communities who have the greatest all risk mortalities and morbidities and who have the lowest LDL cholesterols . ” 24 Maybe the lesson here is the same one we gleaned from Campbell ’s rats : it ’s pretty tough to get sick when you ’re dead !
The Gist
Despite its increasing popularity ( and glowing endorsements by high - profile vegan converts like Bill Clinton ) , The China Study is , in many ways , more a work of fiction than a nutritional holy grail .
The book has spawned a number of myths about the hazards of animal protein and the true results of the China Study itself — myths that easily crumble under a scrutinizing eye , but nonetheless continue trickling into the mainstream and gaining mounting publicity .
If there ’s anything positive to take away from the book ’s four hundred seventeen pages , it ’s the promotion of a whole - food diet — and the resulting elimination of vegetable oils , high fructose corn syrup , refined grains , and other industrial products that tend to displace real food on our modern menus .
But for those seeking scientific literature of a higher caliber , The Psychology of the Simpsons is likely to be a more satisfying ( and animal - product - friendly ) read .

It seemed like a splendid idea , this canoeing trip his friend Mike offered .
Jim gathered up the necessary supplies for this great canoe adventure .
Loading up Mikes truck , and firmly securing the canoe above , Mike looked over at Jim , and said “ this is going to be one hell of a trip . . ”
It sounded cynical , but really they had planned this first time trip for the kids , and JIm believed he had a firmer grip on this “ great outdoors ” idea than met the eye , so all should go well .
They drove to the drop off point and unloaded their gear , and readying the canoe .
Once that was settled , they had to drive down to the end spot , and park , then walk back to the canoe .
The hike was pretty fast , even with Jims two kids , Gabby and Kaine - who did not often enjoy a good walk , Jim realized this trip would be a piece of cake !
They got the kids into the canoe with no difficulties , and set off .
It was 1:30 in the afternoon .
Almost immediately the path was crossed with a fallen tree .
“ No biggie , ” Mike said , “ we ’ll just start on the other side of it , do n’t worry . ”
Jim actually believed him , and helped pushed the canoe , through the current across the river and away from the tree to the open side .
Breaking a sweat , and wet half way up his pants , he thought to himself , man !
this is what I have been missing from the great outdoors …
With the canoe afloat , they sailed easily down the river , caught up in a decent flow .
It was almost nice , Jim was thinking .
Then suddenly , Wham !
Another tree , this one spanning the length of the river , “ what the heck , Mike ? ! ? ”
Jim exclaimed .
“ Hey , we will just get out , carry the canoe to the other side of the tree , and then , I ’m sure we ’ll be fine . ” said Mike .
Resignedly , Jim replied , “ Yeah you ’re right , you said your friend just kayaked this right … RIGHT ? ” Mike just said ” uh yea yea , right . ”
Alright , they were again back on track , making good time , enjoying the scenery , then out of nowhere ..
A sand bar ???
Since when do rivers have sandbars ?
Jim found himself thinking .
This is a total nightmare , why did n’t I just let their mom take them , she actually enjoys this outside crap !
Incidentally a canoe does n’t go fast or far in three inches of water .
So guess who got to get out to push ?
For about 300 yards , Jim pushed the canoe , listening mutely as the kids roared in laughter at this situation .
Welling up to a clever tirade , he opened his mouth to tell them off , and … oops , drop off .
Now Jim was soaking wet and forgot his rant .
Dripping in the sailing away vessel he hears a noise .
A high pitched , multi voiced orchestra of sorts ….
ARGH !
It stung and itched !!!
Aw crap , of course the one item that would have not crossed the mind of a Holiday Inn camper , as essential to have was sadly forgotten .
Bug spray , and in Michigan , where the state bird ought to be the mosquito , the wretched by - plane sized beasts are plentiful , even in the big cities .
Michigan mosquitoes are no laughing matter .
If you are caught with out the protection of DEET , they know , and they spread the word incredibly fast .
Now in addition to unsightly welts that form from a bite , you also have a chance at getting diseases , oh wonderful .
The only way to keep the parasites at bay were to go faster in the canoe , try to out run them .
This motley crew of canoers were doing pretty good at keeping the pace just fast enough .
Up ahead they spotted a bridge , cool , Jim was thinking , I never canoed underneath a bridge before , this is really cool .
Luck being where it was in regards to Jim though , quickly killed that thought process .
Would n’t you know it , another damn tree … .
Once again , they pick up the 200 pound canoe , and walk it to the other side of the bridge .
So much for canoing under it , Jim bitterly thought .
By now he felt they needed a break from carrying , pushing , and intermittently rowing the canoe down river .
He tells the kids , who were raised since infant - hood on Lake Huron , to go ahead and swim if they like , He knows he will finally get a break from worrying .
After a little while , he and Mike felt rested enough to carry on .
They called for the kids and began boarding the canoe .
As Kaine was climbing in , Gabby saw something on his leg .
“ LEACH !!!! ” she screamed shrilly like someone had been murdered and pointed to Kaines leg .
Mike was the more outdoorsy of the two , and used Kaine ’s pocketknife to scrape the leach off his leg .
Just in time for him to see one on his sisters leg .
This was not going to be fun .
“ Gabby , I need you to relax , this will only take a second , ” Jim instructed her ” Dad , it is n’t that one I am worried about , Kaine pushed me into the mud and I am afraid their is one somewhere else , ” she answered shakily .
So for the first time in eleven years Jim had to look at his daughters bare bottom , embarrassing both of them completely .
Luckily she was further , leach free .
They got in , hoping to never have to do that again .
Rowing off into their adventure once again , they were all glad to be away from the leach beach .
Rowing went well for quite some time , the guys were thinking they must be nearing the end of their trip , plenty of time had passed .
Perhaps just around this bend they were coming upon , would be the path home .
It was a home , of sorts , just not the home the canoers hoped for .
It was the largest widest beaver dam they had ever seen .
The dam blocked the river so well that a 500 yard strip of sand had formed another sand bar .
Jim sucked it up , blinked the tears that wanted to pour and held back the anguished “ why ? oh why ? ” wail that filled his throat .
He seemed to be getting used to this version of non traditional canoing .
They head up the sand bar , feet sucking in , when Mike says . ” we should carry the canoe through the path in the woods instead of through this sand . ”
It made sence to Jim who said , “ sure , why not . ”
This is when Jim and the kids discovered an interesting plant .
This plant is called nettles , or nicknamed fire - weed .
Its nickname was cleverly devised from the feeling your body gets , like it is on fire , when you come into contact with it .
As Jim ’s legs began to burn , his mind drifted to an episode on survival in the woods , he had seen on television .
Yay ! for The Discovery channel !
He began scooping mud up and smearing it onto his legs , instructing the kids to do the same , ahhh who knew mud could fell so good ?
They finally emerged form the woods , to the sound of the river .
Boarding the SS Fun-ride , they set off again , drifting down for almost an hour .
An hour of uninterrupted canoing , when a new problem arises for them .
A fork in the river , two choices , Jim looked at Mike and asked , “ now what captain ?
which way ? ”
Mike just said , “ ah ” .
They decided to dock and mull things over , and luckily Jim being ever so outdoorsy had packed his G.P.S. in the pack of essential items .
Later , telling the tale he would get laughed at for bringing the tom tom , but today he was a hero .
The device headed them in the right direction , Yay technology !!
They were nearing the end of the trip , Jim checked the time , 6:30 .
It has taken five hours to go the two miles .
Hooting with joy that they had made it Mike and Jim pulled the canoe ashore , noticing people staring at them .
It took a moment before it dawned on them , yelling the way they were , and covered in mud , like a group of saved castaways , how pathetic .
Jim , mulling over the day recalled Mikes words and realized how right he was that this would be on hell of an adventure , one they will not soon forget .
BOSTON -- A Boston newspaper is reporting that the Red Sox fired two security staffers last summer after an investigation into steroid use .
Jared Remy , the son of Red Sox television commentator Jerry Remy , and Nicholas Alex Cyr both told The Boston Globe that they used steroids , but denied any knowledge of drug use by players .
The Red Sox issued a statement saying they worked with Major League Baseball in investigating the staffers , but said that investigation is confidential .
Major League Baseball said its investigation was " thorough and detailed . "
" They did n't ask much at all ; they wanted to make it disappear , " Jared Remy said , according to the report .
The Globe says state police confiscated a vial of steroids from Cyr's car just before last year 's All - Star break , and Cyr told police he had bought the drug from Remy .
The league 's investigation of the matter failed to uncover where Remy had obtained the steroids , the newspaper reported .
" I was never asked a question from anyone on the Red Sox -- not one , " Remy said .
" You would 've thought they would 've asked me something , you know ? "
Cyr was accompanied by his mother to his meeting with an MLB investigator , according to the report .
Cyr and his mother said the official was interested only in whether high - profile members of the team had been using steroids .
" That 's all he wanted to know , " Lindsey Cyr said .
" He asked Alex if Alex had ever given any to Manny Ramirez , and he said absolutely not . ''

THE mournful eyes of the orphaned baby orang - utans held in Borneo ’s sanctuaries would tug at the stoniest of hearts .
But while rehabilitating abandoned orang - utans is admirable , it seems increasingly clear that it will not help to conserve a species in danger of extinction through habitat loss .
Instead , orang - utan researchers and conservationists in Sabah , in Malaysian Borneo , may have to do what had until recently been unthinkable : join forces with the palm oil industry whose plantations have eaten into much of the orang - utan ’s habitat .
October this year will see an unprecedented meeting …
Gizmag is always on the lookout for alternative means of powering vehicles and saving precious fossil fuels .
But , in truth , the vast majority of us still drive exclusively petrol - powered cars .
And the even sadder truth , outlined in a new research from the University of Michigan , is that the average fuel efficiency of a US vehicle has improved only three miles per gallon since the days of the Ford Model T .
Michael Sivak and Omer Tsimhonia , of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute , calculated the distance driven and fuel consumed for the entire US fleet of vehicles – incorporating cars , motorcycles , trucks and buses – between 1923 and 2006 .
Using those numbers , they were then able to analyze fuel efficiency on US roads at any time , and make telling comparisons between eras .
According to Ford , the Model T – which began mass - production in 1913 – averaged a fairly healthy 25 miles to the gallon .
Nonetheless , by 1923 , the year the study begins , the average fuel efficiency of the entire US fleet was 14 mpg .
That figure remained about the same for more than a decade .
From 1935 , however , fuel efficiency fell into steady decline , dropping to an alarming 11.9 mpg in 1973 .
When you think about the kind of vehicles released through that time – and the number of extras that steadily became standard – it ’s almost not surprising .
All those fins and chrome and power - assisted systems came with heavy penalties in efficiency .
The Environmental Defense Fund , for example , estimates that air - conditioning alone decreases the fuel efficiency of a car by as much as 12 % .
But , with the fuel crisis of the 70’s , fleet efficiency was compelled to improve , and in a hurry .
From 1974 the economy of the US fleet improved five miles a gallon to 16.9 mpg in 1991 .
Curiously , since then – despite growing environmental awareness and publicly - voiced concern – improvement has been painfully slow , reaching just 17.2 mpg in 2006 .
The underlying problem in recent years , of course , is n’t with new cars , some of which can achieve close to 40 mpg .
It ’s all those old vehicles out there , chewing up gas like there ’s no tomorrow .
As far as Sivak and Tsimhoni are concerned , it ’s much more important to improve fuel efficiency at this end – from 15 to 16 mpg , say – than trying to get a Prius from 40 to 41 mpg .
By their estimates , for the US to reduce its total annual fuel consumption by 10 % , fuel efficiency across the entire fleet of cars , motorbikes , truck and buses would have to rise nearly two percent .
That may not sound like much , but it took 15 years for a 0.3 % change .
And when you ’re talking about 10,000 pounds of carbon dioxide from the average medium - sized sedan , making a change has never seemed more critical .
Prior to the committee ’s vote , Weiner spoke passionately about why he believed a single payer health care option would be superior plan for American Healthcare Reform .
Single payer is a term used to describe the means by which a universal health care system would be financed .
Single payer health care describes the payment of doctors , hospitals , and other health care providers from a single fund .
It is often mentioned as one way to deliver near - universal or universal health care .
The administrator of the fund could be the government but it could also be a publicly owned agency regulated by law .
Australia 's Medicare , Canada 's Medicare , and healthcare in Taiwan are examples of single - payer universal health care systems .
The scope may be national , such as the Canadisn system , state - wide , or community - based .
The payer may be a governmental unit or other entity such as an insurance company .
Proponents of sinle payer health care advocate advantages including administrative simplicity for patients and providers , and resulting significant savings in overhead costs .
“ In a single - payer system , all hospitals , doctors , and other health care providers would bill one entity for their services , " explains one industry proponent .
" This alone reduces administrative waste greatly , and saves money , which can be used to provide care and insurance to those who currently do n’t have it . ”
Henry Waxman , the chairman of the Energy Committee , offered a quid pro quo for Weiner .
He told the congressman that he spoke with Speaker Pelosi and she “ pledged ” to allow “ this issue to come to the House floor for a vote ” if Weiner withdrew his amendment .
When pressed further on the issue , Waxman told Weiner that Pelosi “ will allow this to be brought up on the House floor and debated and voted on . ”
“ I gladly accept that offer because I think there should be an alternative to what is coming out of this , ” Weiner said .
“ And if that is the pledge , I gladly on behalf of my colleagues …ask that the amendment be withdrawn . ”
In a news release following the Energy Committee ’s passage of the bill , Weiner said , “ Single - payer is a better plan and now it is on center stage .
Americans have a clear choice .
Their member of Congress will have a simpler , less expensive and smarter bill to choose .
I am thrilled that the Speaker is giving us that choice . ”
Weiner , Co-Chair of the Middle Class Caucus and a member of the Energy & Commerce Committee , has led the effort for a single - payer solution along with Rep. Tammy Baldwin , D - Wisc. , Rep. Mike Doyle , D - Penn. , Rep. Elliot Engel , D-NY , Rep. Rep. Bobby Rush , D - Illinois , Rep. Janice Schakowsky , D - Illinois , and Rep. Peter Welch , D - Vermont .
Even President Barack Obama ’s former personal physician came out in support of the single - payer health care solution .
David Scheiner , who treated Obama for more than 20 years , said under the single - payer plan people will [ eventually ] pay less . ”
Scheiner made his comments at a news conference convened last week at the National Press Club where a rally organized by Healthcare NOW , a coalition of more than a dozen healthcare advocacy groups , got together to pressure Congress to pass legislation in support of the single - payer system .
President Obama has said he does not believe a single - payer health care system , while successful in other countries , would work in the United States because of the volume of people who receive health insurance from their employers .
Obama , however , does support a government - operated public - option plan , which would compete with private insurers .

Last week it was revealed that the average work week of non-farm workers had dropped to an all - time low of 33 hours .
It 's a worrying sign that even with all the layoffs , employers are n't making their existing employees work more .
So what happened to the 40 - hour work week ?
Turns out , that 's a long , distant memory .

While the US State Department publicly insisted the official Obama Administration on the Israeli settlements had not changed , privately diplomats are saying that the adminstration has done a virtual 180 , backing off pretty much all its demands with respect to Israel ’s settlement activity .
At this point , the US had agreed to completely abandon complaints over Israeli construction in East Jerusalem , which Israel occupied in 1967 .
Though the US will not publicly endorse the continued construction it will no longer ask Israel to freeze them .
About all they got was a dubious promise from the Netanyahu government to not issue new construction permits for settlements in the West Bank for nine months .
Even this promise likely means little , as thousands of already approved construction projects will continue in the meantime and the Israeli government is already talking about an exit strategy from the program , even though it has n’t officially halted the permits yet .
The Palestinian Authority has previously said it will not return to the peace talks without a halt to the settlement expansion , and in all likelihood a brief pause in new permits will likely not be sufficient to them .
Since the Israelis are giving President Obama everything he is asking for at this point ( which is to say , virtually nothing ) this may result in the US returning to its familiar role of cheering Israel as a peacemaker while chastising the Palestinians .

I 'll be your mummy and you be my little kitty cat : Anjana the chimp shows off her parenting skills ... with a puma cub
She has a tender heart , a nice hairy shoulder to cry on - and she knows where her zoo keeps the baby wipes .
So Anjana the chimpanzee is well qualified to be a kitten - sitter .
Since orphaned puma cub Sierra turned up at the zoo , Anjana has helped her human carers with all the feeding , cuddling and chasing duties .
Primate mum : Anjana the chimp helps zookeepers to care for orphaned puma cub , Sierra
The chimpanzee , who is five , has lived her whole life at The Institute of Greatly Endangered and Rare Species ( TIGERS ) in South Carolina , in the U.S. .
She learned to care for little big cats while in the charge of resident feline curator China York .
Park director Dr Bhagavan
Antle said : ' Chimpanzees are great learners and imitators so it was n't long before she took on the right behaviours that were necessary to keep the kittens in line .
Milking it : Anjana makes sure Sierra gets fed and even knows where the wet wipes are kept
Careful now : A protective Anjana shadows Sierra on a stroll around the zoo
' If Sierra is running around too fast then Anjana will scoop her up and make sure she does n't get into any trouble . '
Anjana has already helped to bring up two royal white tiger cubs , a leopard and four lions .
Long story short for those without short - or long - term memories : After Garland - based video game developer Apogee Software / 3D Realms took forever developing and never delivering Duke Nukem Forever ( 12 years , to be precise ) , the company funding the project -- Take - Two Interactive Software Inc. , responsible for Grand Theft Auto and the millions that went into the project -- sued the locals ; Take - Two wants , among other things , the source code for the game .
But that was two months ago , and the story 's gotten crazy complicated since then , with complaints and counter - complaints flying from all directions .
But the latest revelation 's an interesting one that also concerns a major local game creator -- Gearbox Software , so happens , straight outta Plano .
ShackNews , which has been keeping tabs on the story that 'll probably turn into a movie starring Jim Sturgess , reveals that in court docs filed by Take - Two , the company happened to mention that Gearbox is also working on a Duke Nukem sequel -- Duke Begins , ironic .
But , see Apogee insists the game 's been canceled , and that Take - Two could n't nuke the game , the result of a deal between Take - Two and Apogee dating back to ' 07 , without its permission .
To which Take - Two replies : Unh -unh and no way , respectively .
In a related story , GearBox appears to have 13 job openings .
So hop to , genius .
The 2009 Tour de France is underway , with the opening stage taking place on July 4th .
While I do n’t expect many Americans to tune in on Independence Day , you do have 3 weeks left to enjoy this most epic of races .
Yesterday we brought you a Tour de France Preview , but today we step back a bit , and provide a primer for Americans who are looking to experience the sport , possibly for the first time .
With Lance Armstrong returning from retirement , coverage of this event on ESPN and other national sports outlets will most certainly be high , so we ’re here to help get you oriented .
Doping in Cycling :
Lets get this out of the way first .
Yes , there is a doping problem in Professional Cycling .
In recent years , numerous riders have tested positive , and have been expelled from the race and the sport .
The good news is that most of the names associated with doping scandals will not be racing in this year ’s Tour .
Cycling has a tarnished reputation for doping , however in my opinion the sport should be applauded for catching the cheats , and getting rid of them .
Riders are tested numerous times during the race , and all throughout the season , much more extensively than you will see in any other sport .
In the 2008 Tour , 180 riders entered , and only 8 were caught up in doping scandal .
That is less than 4.5 % , and the biggest names were caught using MIRCERA , a new form of EPO which had just recently been developed .
The testing kept up with the cheaters , and even the newest form was detected .
Cycling has never ignored their doping problem , and they have always been at the forefront of fighting it .
I wish the same could be said for other sports that we enjoy .
Cycling Terms
Cycling certainly has its own language .
For the most part , we ’ll try to avoid using the French terminology , but below are some terms that you should be aware of as you read this primer , and watch the coverage .
Peloton – The main group of riders .
Break , Breakaway – a group of riders that take off ahead of the Peleton .
Chase – single rider or group that tries to catch up to the leader or breakaway group .
Domestique – A designated rider who sacrifices personal performance to help the team .
Drafting – Riding closely behind another rider , saving energy .
GC , General Classification – Tracks the overall leader based on time .
Time Trial – Simply a race against the clock .
Each rider rides individually .
Team Time Trial – A team race against the clock , ultimate test of teamwork .
Prologue – A short time trial that opens the Tour .
Flat stages – Minimal climbs , typically feature a bunched sprint finish .
Mountain stages – Big climbs , dominated by the GC riders .
Jerseys :
There are several competitions going on during the three week Tour de France .
The most prestigious of which is certainly the general classification .
In addition , earning a stage win in the Tour de France is certainly a prestigious event in itself .
There is also a team competition which awards the team with the lowest overall time .
At the conclusion of each stage there is a podium presentation ( with babes ) for the stage winner , and the winner of each jersey .
Below is an overview of the primary jerseys .
Yellow – General Classification , Overall leader on time
Green – Points Classification – Most consistent rider , sprinting points leader
Polka Dot – King of the Mountains – climbing points leader
White –
Best young rider – overall time leader under the age of 25
American Riders :
The United States has seven riders entered into the 96th Tour de France , which is n’t a large percentage of the field , however they will have a major impact .
Of the seven , only one is riding in his first tour .
Lance Armstrong , 37 , Astana
This is the one name that hopefully needs no introduction .
This is Lance ’s 12th time entering the Tour de France , and he has won a record 7 times ( consecutively too ) .
Armstrong retired after the 2005 race , but now he is back and is looking to regain his title .
Lance is primarily racing to raise awareness for his cancer fighting charity , Livestrong , but he is a definite contender for the general classification .
Lance excels in time trials and in the mountains .
Levi Leipheimer , 35 , Astana
Levi is easily the second biggest name in American cycling at the moment .
He has won his hometown Tour of California for three years straight and this will be his 7th time riding in the Tour de France .
His highest finish came in 2007 , when he finished 3rd behind his teammate Alberto Contador .
Like Lance , Levi excels in time trials and in the mountains .
It is anticipated that Levi will ride for teammates Armstrong and Contador again this season .
Christian Vande Velde , 33 , Garmin - Slipstream
Christian had a stellar 2008 season , finishing 4th overall in the Tour de France , and leading the Giro d’Italia for several days .
Unfortunately he suffered a major crash at this year ’s Italian race , and is now recovering from injury .
He is the leader of the American team , Garmin - Slipstream .
He is an underdog for the overall title , and also excels in time trials and the mountains .
Tyler Farrar , 25 , Garmin - Slipstream
Tyler is the new kid on the block , riding in his first Tour de France .
Unlike the other riders profiled here , Farrar is a sprinter , and will get demolished in the mountains .
His time will come in the flat stages , towards the beginning of the Tour .
It is very possible that he wo n’t even finish the entire 21 stage event , but he is looking to make an impact among the fast men .
He finished 2nd in two stages of this year ’s Giro , and defeated the world ’s fastest man , Mark Cavendish , at a race in Italy earlier this year .
George Hincapie , 36 , Columbia -HTC
George is a favorite of American cycling fans , due to his longevity , loyalty , and determination .
He is riding in his 14th Tour de France , and rode with Lance Armstrong in all seven victories .
George ’s ability to cut the wind in front of Lance on the slopes of the low mountains was instrumental in Armstrong ’s success .
He is the epitome of a team rider .
He has had individual success in time trials and stages in the past , but now he serves primarily as a lead out man for his team ’s sprinter , Mark Cavendish .
David Zabriskie , 30 , Garmin - Slipstream
David is a time trial specialist , and has won stages in each of the grand tours ( France , Italy , Spain ) .
He finished 2nd overall in this year ’s Tour of California .
This will be his 5th entry into the Tour de France , and his most successful ride came in 2005 when he held the Yellow Jersey for several days after winning the prologue time trial .
Danny Pate , 30 , Garmin - Slipstream
Danny is competing in his 2nd Tour de France , after making an impressive debut last year .
He finished 3rd on the 15th stage , and recorded some good times in the time trials .
He will be a team rider for Christian Vande Velde , but may take a chance in a breakaway when the Tour enters the lower mountains .
Teams to Watch :
Many people do n’t realize what a team sport cycling really is .
20 teams will participate in this year ’s Tour de France , each containing 9 members .
Each team certainly has their own goals .
While some will be riding for one man in the General Classification , others will be looking for stage victories in the sprints , or just to get some television time in France .
A typical team is well rounded , with climbers , sprinters , and domestiques .
As you watch the Tour , you will notice the teams riding in formation , with the leaders of the team drafting behind their teammates , conserving energy until the final climb or sprint .
Lance Armstrong is certainly one of the strongest riders ever , but he also benefited greatly from having one of the strongest teams around him , built to help him succeed .
Below we will feature the three teams that will be of the most interest to American spectators .
Astana ( AST )
Astana is actually based out of Kazakstan , but features the two strongest American riders , Lance Armstrong , and Levi Leipheimer .
How did they get on Astana ?
Johan Bruyneel holds the answer .
As the most successful team director in cycling , Bruyneel is the tactician that coached Lance to his 7 victories , and Lance and Levi both followed Johan to Astana .
So while it was great to see Armstrong riding in the colors of U.S. Postal for so many years , this year we will watch him in the colors of Borat ’s homeland .
Astana is a loaded team , with Lance and Alberto Contador of Spain serving as co-leaders .
Leipheimer , Kloden , Zubeldia , and Popovych are other big names riding on the team which only includes one Kazak rider .
This team has an extensive history in the sport which may not be apparent to all who tune in .
They were originally formed as Team Telekom , then became T - Mobile .
Following doping scandals the team then moved to the United Stated under the name Team Highroad , and is now named for sponsors , Columbia - HTC .
The team only contains one American , George Hincapie , who most likely will be riding for his teammates .
They will however most likely make a lot of noise early in the Tour with team leader Kim Kirchen , and sprinter Mark Cavendish .
Between the two of them , they took 5 stages in last year ’s tour , and grabbed early headlines in France .
Cavendish is easily one of the most exciting young riders in the sport , and oozes confidence .
While not as accomplished or deep as Astana or Columbia , if you are looking for an underdog American team , then Garmin - Slipstream is your team .
The team was established in the United States in 2007 , and will feature 4 American riders in this year ’s Tour .
Garmin - Slipstream is noted for having extensive internal doping controls .
This new team on the block had an excellent premier at the 2008 Tour , competing early in the team competition , and having the 4th overall rider Christian Vande Velde .
They have already begun strong in this year ’s race with Bradley Wiggins placing 3rd in the prologue .
Look for Tyler Farrar to go for stage wins early in the sprints , and for Vande Velde to emerge in the mountains .
What to Watch :
So now that you know who the major players are for U.S. fans , how do you watch this spectacle ?
Well first of all , Versus has all of the coverage for the Tour de France again , and they do an excellent job .
They have a four man team that tackles the action in groups of two .
Each day coverage starts at around 8:30 AM ET with a pre-race set show ( usually from the finish line ) .
They then proceed to cover that day ’s stage in semi live fashion .
The finish is live , but normally the beginning of the stage is summarized with video clips .
The morning coverage is handled by Phil Ligget and Paul Sherwin , and they tend to focus primarily on the race .
I normally Tivo this coverage , and watch it in the evenings .
Ligget and Sherwin are excellent , and honestly I enjoy their accents .
However if you are a cycling novice , you may prefer the evening coverage .
Each evening at 8 PM ET , Bob Roll and Craig Hummer present prime - time expanded coverage .
Expanded means that they cover more than just the race .
They profile riders , teams , history , and locations .
While they do n’t focus as much one the race as the morning coverage , its a very long race , so missing a few minutes here and there is n’t going to hurt you .
They also focus more on educating the viewers about the sport , the equipment , the tactics , etc .
Both shows are presented in glorious high definition , and we mean glorious .
One of my favorite parts of watching cycling is the HD helicopter filmed panoramas of the French countryside and architecture .
The images below are still shots , but they give you an indication of the beauty of this sport .
Hopefully now you have a better understanding of this sport , and will tune in to watch .
If you need further convincing , consider this .
The French suck at the Tour de France .
I have n’t done the math yet , but there will most likely be more French riders in this event than any other nationality , yet the Frenchies will make only a minor impact on their premier event .
So if you enjoy watching the French struggle for some semblance of national pride , this is the event for you .
At least 1 million Americans have contracted the novel H1N1 influenza , according to mathematical models prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , while data from the field indicate that the virus continues to spread even though the normal flu season is over , and that an increasing proportion of victims are being hospitalized .
Meanwhile , the virus is continuing its rapid spread through the Southern Hemisphere .
Nearly 28,000 laboratory - confirmed U.S. cases of the virus , also known as swine flu , have been reported to the CDC , almost half of the more than 56,000 cases globally reported to the World Health Organization .
But Lyn Finelli , a CDC flu surveillance official , told a vaccine advisory committee meeting in Atlanta on Thursday that standard models of viral spread indicated that many times that number had been infected .
Although 1 million may seem like a high number , between 15 million and 60 million Americans are infected by the influenza virus during a normal flu season .

At least 3,065 of those infected with this flu in the U.S. have been hospitalized , and 127 have died .
The very young are most likely to be infected , Finelli said , but older patients seem to suffer more :
Though the average age of those infected is 12 , hospitalized patients are on average 20 years old , and the average age of those who die is 37 .
The normal seasonal flu virus has virtually disappeared from this country , as expected .
But the novel H1N1 virus is continuing to spread , and now accounts for 98 % of all cases .
“ It does n’t look like transmission is declining at all , ” Finelli said .
The spread is highest in New England and the Northeast .
“ Very high volumes ” of patients have overwhelmed hospitals and labs in New York ’s Monroe County -- which includes Rochester -- according to Dr. Andrew Doniger , county public health director .
He called on those who have mild symptoms to self - medicate at home .

In the Southern Hemisphere , which is one month into its flu season , several countries , particularly Chile , Argentina and Australia , are already feeling the effects of the new virus .
Chile has had more than 4,000 lab - confirmed cases and seven deaths , Argentina more than 1,200 cases and 17 deaths , and Australia 3,200 cases and three deaths .
In Argentina , the virus is spreading particularly rapidly in the conurbano , the densely populated working - class suburbs and slums that ring Buenos Aires .
Area hospitals are postponing elective surgeries to free more beds for flu patients , and the government is sending mobile clinics into many neighborhoods .
In Chile , ER visits have tripled and waiting times in public hospitals are seven hours or more .
Epidemiologists fear that the novel H1N1 virus may exchange genetic information with other flu viruses while it is working its way through the Southern Hemisphere , and develop a greater pathogenicity when it returns to the north this fall , but so far that is not happening , said WHO Director - General Margaret Chan .

In a news conference in Moscow on Thursday , she said that “ the virus is still very stable .
. . .
But we all know the influenza virus is highly unpredictable and has great potential for mutation . ”
One surprising victim of the virus is a pig in Argentina .
Jorge Amaya , director of the animal health and sanitation service there , said that the animal had recovered and that other pigs were being tested for the virus .
He said he thinks the pig caught it from a human .
That was the initial theory when researchers found the virus in a Canadian herd early in the pandemic , but tests showed that it was different from the one that had infected their caretaker .
No one knows how the pigs became infected .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has been monitoring pigs throughout this country for signs of the virus , but has reported no infections .

Some help for the upcoming winter flu season is on the way .
The French pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis said Thursday that it had begun large - scale production of a vaccine against the novel H1N1 virus .
It did not say how many doses it was preparing , and noted that it was still producing seasonal flu vaccine for the Northern and Southern hemispheres .
The company has the capacity to make 270 million doses of vaccine a year at its three plants , two in the United States and one in France .
The novel H1N1 vaccine has to be tested before it can be used .

Have you recently teamed up with a mysterious druid in World of Warcraft that happens to love math puzzles ?
You could have been on a raid with Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov .
" I recently started playing World of Warcraft , and I 'm still playing it and enjoying it a lot , " Pajitnov said in a recent interview with Wired.com on the eve of his legendary puzzle game 's 25th anniversary .
Pajitnov is currently playing a level - 74 female druid in the popular massively multiplayer online game .
And it 's not his first character :
He says he 's also played a warlock up to level 70 and a hunter before that .
He never tells anyone that he created one of the most popular videogames of all time , though .
" Nobody even knows that I am male , " he said .
" I play just female characters . "
As you might expect , Pajitnov is interested in the MMO world 's complex game design .
" It was very interesting for me , how the design works , " he said .
" I really enjoyed the design work in Warcraft , because they must have a really huge team , and it was amazing how they distribute their activity and create together . "
Playing WoW has been " a very unusual experience , " he says , because in his 25 - year career as a game designer , he has rarely gotten hooked on other people 's videogames .
The only other games he 's played with the same level of passion were Nintendo's Zelda games and the four - color CGA version of Lode Runner .
( " I was absolutely addicted for more than a year . " )
Although Pajitnov mostly plays Warcraft solo , he has partnered with others on occasion .
" I 've joined several guilds , " he said .
" I did have a group which I used to play with a lot together , but later we lost each other and now I just have temporary alliances with different groups . "
So now you 've got to ask yourself :
Is that level - 74 druid in your guild a game - design legend in disguise ?
The iPhone 's lithium ion batteries are thought to be to blame A number of iPhones that reportedly " exploded " in France were not due to the battery overheating as had been suggested , Apple has said .
The firm said that all of the handsets they had seen with broken screens were caused by an " external force " .
Watchdogs had launched investigations after reports of iPhones that had exploded or cracked spontaneously .
France 's top trade official is meeting with the financial director of Apple France to discuss the claims .
Herve Novelli , secretary of state for trade and consumer affairs , said he would question Apple 's Michel Coulomb about the " causes of the implosion of these devices and eventual measures they could take , " according to AP .
Consumers in the UK , Holland and Sweden had reported similar problems .
" To date , there are no confirmed battery overheating incidents for iPhone 3GS and the number of reports we are investigating is in the single digits , " Apple said in a statement .
Apple has sold 26 million iPhones and 200 million iPods to date .
" The iPhones with broken glass that we have analysed to date show that in all cases the glass cracked due to an external force that was applied to the iPhone . "
But Frank Benoiton , of Acheres - la - Foret in France , said his wife 's iPhone had cracked without warning last week and denied he or his wife were to blame .
" It was not dropped and experienced no unusual shock , " he told AP .
On Tuesday , a 26 - year - old security guard has claimed that he was hit in the eye with a glass shard when his iPhone screen cracked up .
The recent cases prompted French watchdog DGCCRF to investigate the complaints .
The European Commission also used its Rapex system to issue an alert to its 27 member states about the problem .
Rapex is the EU rapid alert system for dangerous consumer products .
The system issue alerts for multiple products every week , sometimes leading to mass product recalls , but often with no consequence .

WASHINGTON , Aug. 16 , 2009 --
After searching for more than 50 years , scientists finally have discovered a number of new mosquito repellents that beat DEET , the gold standard for warding off those pesky , sometimes disease - carrying insects .
The stuff seems like a dream come true .
It makes mosquitoes buzz off three times longer than DEET , the active ingredient in many of today 's bug repellents .
It does not have the unpleasant odor of DEET .
And it does not cause DEET 's sticky - skin sensation .
But there 's a fly in the ointment :
The odds may be stacked against any of the new repellents finding a place on store shelves this year or next -- or ever .
Ulrich Bernier , Ph.D. , lead researcher for the repellent study , said the costly , time - consuming pre-market testing and approval process is a hurdle that will delay availability of the repellents , which were discovered last year .
The results of his team 's work were presented today at the 238th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society ( ACS ) by Maia Tsikoli , Ph.D. , a post - doctoral researcher working with Bernier .
" Commercial availability of topical repellents can take years and a significant investment to achieve that end goal , " Bernier said .
" The cost will be several hundred thousand dollars .
Once you determine that the repellent works through some screening process , we then have to go through a toxicological hazard evaluation involving numerous toxicological tests . "
Provided the repellents continue to work well when tested in the laboratory on human skin , and if they pass the battery of toxicological tests , they would still face a series of tests to prove their effectiveness in making mosquitoes bug off , Bernier said .
" Clearly , the odds are stacked against new repellent products making it to market , " he noted .
Bernier and his team discovered the repellents with what they say is the first successful application of a computer model using the molecular structures of more than 30,000 chemical compounds tested as repellents over the last 60 years .
Using 11 known compounds , they synthesized 23 new ones .
Of those , 10 gave about 40 days protection , compared to 17.5 days for DEET , when a soaked cloth was worn by a human volunteer .
When applied to the skin , however , DEET lasts about five hours .
Bernier routinely participates in repellency studies , which involve about 500 mosquitoes trying to land on his arm and bite through a repellent - soaked cloth .
" If the mosquitoes do n't even land , we know the repellent is surely working , " he explained .
" If they walk around on the cloth - covered - arm , they are on the verge of being repelled .
If they bite ... on to the next repellent . "
Overall , in addition to lasting longer than current products , including DEET , the new repellents do n't have the stickiness or unpleasant smell common with today 's insect sprays and liquids , said Bernier .
He said that extended studies are now evaluating the effectiveness of the repellents against flies and ticks .
" This was quite an ambitious project , " Bernier said .
" The USDA historical archives and repellents database we used consisted of more than 30,000 chemical structures tested over the past six decades . "
To search for the best repellents , the team devised software that recognized structural features of a chemical that would make it effective in keeping the bugs away .
They trained it by feeding it the molecular structures of 150 known repellents .
Based on this information , the program learned to identify the chemical traits of a good repellent without the chemists even having to know what those traits were .
For example , the team checked out 2,000 variants of a compound found in black pepper that repels insects .

This study was partly supported by the Deployed War - Fighter Protection ( DWFP ) Research Program , funded by the U.S. Department of Defense through the Armed Forces Pest Management Board ( AFPMB ) .
The American Chemical Society is a nonprofit organization chartered by the U.S. Congress .
With more than 154,000 members , ACS is the world 's largest scientific society and a global leader in providing access to chemistry - related research through its multiple databases , peer - reviewed journals and scientific conferences .

For Tom , it was love at first sight when she walked into the greeting card company where he worked , she the new administrative assistant .
Soon ,
Tom knew that Summer was the woman with whom he wanted to spend the rest of his life .
Although Summer did not believe in relationships or boyfriends - in her assertion , real life will always ultimately get in the way - Tom and Summer became more than just friends .

Sen. Bernie Sanders ' appearance on the Rachel Maddow show last week really stuck in Bill O'Reilly 's craw like a chicken bone , so he tried to spit it out by naming Sanders a " Pinhead " on The O'Reilly Factor last night .
Here 's what Sanders said :
Sanders :
We need to do grass roots organizing .
I 'll tell you what else we need to do .
We need to understand that it is very , very hard for the president or anybody else to take on , not just the Republican Party - that 's the easy part - to take on all of right - wing talk radio which covers 90 percent of talk show hosts , a whole FOX Network which is nothing more than an arm of the Republican Party .
O'Reilly 's response : To make fun of Sanders ' thick New England accent and insist that Sanders ' charge was " false " -- though of course he had no way of proving otherwise .
Especially since Sanders is saying something every sane person who watches Fox ( admittedly , those numbers are shrinking ) can see for themselves .
Though to be more precise , Fox actually is an arm of movement conservatism , and the GOP is the movement 's political home .
So they are both components of the same ideological movement , which means that Fox is n't really an arm of the GOP , but rather its ideological partner and cohort .
The difference , though , is purely a matter of nuance , since the result and effect are exactly the same .
Anti-gay attacks on rise in Iraq
So sad !
The BBC is reporting that Iraqi gay men are being MURDERED !
How horrible !
It says hundreds of gay men have been targeted and killed in Iraq since 2004 .
So - called honour killings also account for deaths where families punish their own kin in order to avoid public shame .
It must be very hard to be happy in Iraq …
The pain they must go through for having no one understand them , it just brings so much sadness to my heart .
Click here for the whole article .
Usually , my articles have had an academic feel .
This one initially was a bit more “ bloggy . ”
But then a commenter made a reasonable point which prompted me to edit and add .
Still more “ bloggy ” than usual .
The timing of this is somewhat unfortunate but also quite coincidental .
Considering that health care is THE topic at this moment in time in America , I suppose it is no time to pull punches , or good information , just to be overly courteous .
And then I think further , and realize the other side is likely attempting to use the same unfortunate circumstance to their advantage , and I realize my pause ( except to show that I do have a heart ) is too silly to worry about .
Since I am attempting to resecure a position in radio , I was listening to an MP3 from me being on a radio show during my “ political activist ” phase in the midst of the 2008 primaries , and one of the things brought up was health care .
A fellow guest mentioned how Ted Kennedy was so outraged over the state of health care and particularly HMOs , even though he was as responsible as anyone for the rise of HMOs to begin with !
I decided to look into it , and it is true .
So here 's a rough sketch for the makings of a great anti-ObamaCare commercial :
1 . A video of Obama speaking in Virginia , saying how he 's happy to take on the health care problem , but he does n't want “ the folks ” who created the health care “ mess ” to do “ a lot of talking . ”
He wants them to “ get out of the way so we can clean up the mess . ”
( many videos available , so its searchable , but here 's a specific one available as of 8/27/09 ) .
2 . One of the things these “ health care reformists ” rail against is the EEEVIL HMOs .
( No reference needed , but easy source to find )
3 . Ted Kennedy was the sponsor of the 1973 HMO Act .
( as noted throughout the internet , but here 's a specific page at the Kaiser Health News site available as of 8/27/09 )
4 . Five years after sponsoring the Act , Kennedy admits to being the proud sponsor of the ' 73 HMO Act , and sounds off on the virtues of HMOs .
( “ Ted Kennedy on HMOs : Then and Now ” available as of 8/27/09 ) .
5 . So … should the Democrats , who are the ones “ responsible for creating the mess ” stop doing “ a lot of talking ” ?
I think that 'd be appropriate .
And indeed helpful .
It should be noted that Nixon signed the 1973 Act , but Kennedy was the sponsor .
It should also be noted that as the aforementioned commenter said , HMOs did exist prior to 1973 , so Kennedy did n't “ create ” them .
What he did do was be as visible of a champion as anyone in the act that made HMOs prominent on the American landscape .
The 1973 act was used as a method to use the “ gatekeeper ” aspect of HMOs to get Medicare and Medicaid costs under control .
The act required employers above a certain size to offer HMOs as options if they were available .
HMOs were subsidized which resulted in artificially lower premiums and more HMOs being created .
Thus many people joined HMOs who would not have otherwise .
The act also removed barriers to the spread of HMOs , including pre-empting state laws that kept doctors from being paid for not providing care .
So the “ lack of patient choice ” so often cited in appeals for “ health care reform ” are very much a result of … previous government health care reform .
The original implied point of this article holds – considering Mr. Kennedy 's emotional outrage at the topic , you certainly would think that if he had the ability to influence the decision of whether HMOs would prosper , he'd have tried to stop them in their tracks .
Yet , he was their champion .
His lack of candor , humility , or responsibility about his historical role and responsibility is the point here , as much as anything .
A supplemental point is Kennedy as a specimen of that political species that after showing no consideration of the potential negative consequences of legislation they support , will later use those negative consequences that they created to seed further government meddling .
Obviously there are more specific reasons to oppose ObamaCare , but this info implies two simple points :
1 . If the Democrats are right , and health care is facing real problems , in essence , considering history , their big solution is to just “ use a bigger hammer . ”
Despite obvious proof of their inability to foresee problems , prior government involvement that did n't work just means its time for more government involvement .
2 . To the extent they 're aware of their previous actions ( always a good question ) , they are being disingenuous with their outrage , as though this situation has only come about because the government has not been allowed to control the situation .
But by any reading , one must conclude that this legislation changed the rules of the game and HAS to be credited with helping to cause the current situation .
One can make the previous two arguments without believing there is a “ health care mess ” – they are “ even assuming you are right ” arguments .
I for one believe there are problems that need to be addressed , but do n't see how a FURTHER separation of customers from payment for the services and goods could ever solve a cost problem .
For a good background on the history of the HMO legislation , its context , effects ( including cost ) , and other good stuff including Kennedy quotes , check out this well - cited article – “ Blame Congress for HMOs ” , by Twila Brase , available as of 8/27/09 ) .

Chocolate Oreo Cupcakes with Cookies and Cream Frosting
Disclosure : I may earn a commission from purchases you make through affiliate links in this post at no additional cost to you .
These Oreo cupcakes are made with dark chocolate and dark cocoa powder to give the distinctive dark look and taste of an Oreo cookie .
Cookies and cream frosting makes them perfect for any Oreo lover !
When I make Oreo cupcakes , I start by using my chocolate cupcake recipe .
My chocolate cupcakes have been tested by over 50 test bakers from around the world and over 60 % of people who bake them say they are not only good , but the best chocolate cupcakes they have ever had .
But , I make a few changes to the cupcakes to make them totally Oreo-y .
How to Make Oreo Cupcakes
To give the chocolate cupcakes an Oreo flavor , it ’s important to use dark cocoa powder .
Hershey ’s Special Dark works really well and it is easy to find at most U.S. grocery stores .
If you want a really dark cocoa powder with a more nuanced flavor , try Cacao Barry Extra Brute ( you will never go back to your old cocoa powder once you try it ! ) .
My Oreo cupcakes use both cocoa powder and melted chocolate for the strongest chocolate flavor .
For the melted chocolate , you will also want to choose something really dark – any chocolate bar that is 70 % of higher chocolate should do the trick .
I used Lily ’s Extremely Dark Chocolate .
I always frost Oreo cupcakes with cookies and cream frosting !
I make my cookies and cream frosting with cream cheese so the frosting tastes like cookies and cream cheesecake !
Of course , it ’s best to top Oreo cupcakes with an Oreo .
I like to use my homemade Oreos .
They have the same flavor profile as the real ones , but I fill them with my very vanilla frosting and the flavor ca n’t be beaten !
Oreo Cupcake Variation
When I first published this recipe in 2009 , I came up with the idea of serving Oreo cupcakes with a built - in chocolate cup for milk !
The idea went viral !
Aside from Oreos , chocolate liquor cups are the key ingredient in this Oreo cupcake variation .
The cups are the perfect size to fit inside the cupcakes and they are able to hold the milk ( which soon turns into chocolate milk ) without it leaking into the cupcake .
Use a small paring knife to cut a wedge out of the cupcake and then stick the cup in the void .
I used some cake from the wedges to make the mouths on my cupcakes .
The wedges are also perfect to simply snack on !
Make sure that the cupcake is completely cool before putting the cup in so that the cup does n’t melt .
I found that the easiest way to fill the cup with milk was to use a small funnel .
Do n’t fill the cups until right before you are ready to serve the cupcakes .
Just like there are many ways to eat an Oreo , there are many ways to eat an Oreo cupcake with built - in milk .
However , there is one key guideline :
Do not bite into the cup until you have drunk all of the milk or you will end up with mess !
I had twelve cupcakes with cups and only one taster ended up with a milky mess – Alan of Patric Chocolate .
Alan claimed that it had nothing to do with him biting into the cup and everything to do with his cup having a crack .
I ’m still inclined to blame user error .
You can use up the milk by dunking Oreos in the cup as shown below .
This works best if you have mini Oreos .
I used my homemade Oreo recipe and cut the circles with a smaller cookie cutter than that recipe specifies .
You could also just break up full - sized Oreos into pieces .
Another idea is to break of the bottom of the cupcake and dunk pieces of the cake in the milk .
To get those last few sips , just hold the cupcake up to your face and drink !
Do n’t worry if you get frosting on your face – just look in the mirror , smile , and then lick it off !
Best Tips for Making Oreo Cupcakes
Use dark cocoa powder .
Use dark chocolate .
If you do n’t have sour cream in the house , I ’ve done extensive testing and found that yogurt works perfectly as a substitute for sour cream .
.
Use any mild vegetable oil .
I ’ve used canola oil , generic vegetable oil , and safflower oil .
I ’ve used canola oil , generic vegetable oil , and safflower oil .
You can make this recipe as a cake .
You will just need to increase the baking time .

I keep these on my counter for three days or refrigerate them for up to a week .

One frustrating aspect of our discussion about the compatibility of science and religion was the amount of effort expended arguing about definitions , rather than substance .
When I use words like " God " or " religion , " I try to use them in senses that are consistent with how they have been understood ( at least in the Western world ) through history , by the large majority of contemporary believers , and according to definitions as you would encounter them in a dictionary .
It seems clear to me that , by those standards , religious belief typically involves various claims about things that happen in the world -- for example , the virgin birth or ultimate resurrection of Jesus .
Those claims can be judged by science , and are found wanting .
Some people would prefer to define " religion " so that religious beliefs entail nothing whatsoever about what happens in the world .
And that 's fine ; definitions are not correct or incorrect , they are simply useful or useless , where usefulness is judged by the clarity of one 's attempts at communication .
Personally , I think using " religion " in that way is not very clear .
Most Christians would disagree with the claim that Jesus came about because Joseph and Mary had sex and his sperm fertilized her ovum and things proceeded conventionally from there , or that Jesus did n't really rise from the dead , or that God did not create the universe .
The Congregation for the Causes of Saints , whose job it is to judge whether a candidate for canonization has really performed the required number of miracles and so forth , would probably not agree that miracles do n't occur .
Francis Collins , recently nominated to direct the NIH , argues that some sort of God hypothesis helps explain the values of the fundamental constants of nature , just like a good Grand Unified Theory would .
These views are by no means outliers , even without delving into the more extreme varieties of Biblical literalism .
Furthermore , if a religious person really did believe that nothing ever happened in the world that could n't be perfectly well explained by ordinary non-religious means , I would think they would expend their argument - energy engaging with the many millions of people who believe that the virgin birth and the resurrection and the promise of an eternal afterlife and the efficacy of intercessory prayer are all actually literally true , rather than with a handful of atheist bloggers with whom they agree about everything that happens in the world .
But it 's a free country , and people are welcome to define words as they like , and argue with whom they wish .
But there was also a more interesting and substantive issue lurking below the surface .
I focused in that post on the meaning of " religion , " but did allude to the fact that defenders of Non-Overlapping Magisteria often misrepresent " science " as well .
And this , I think , is not just a matter of definitions : we can more or less agree on what " science " means , and still disagree on what questions it has the power to answer .
So that 's an issue worth examining more carefully : what does science actually have the power to do ?
I can think of one popular but very bad strategy for answering this question : first , attempt to distill the essence of " science " down to some punchy motto , and then ask what questions fall under the purview of that motto .
At various points throughout history , popular mottos of choice might have been " the Baconian scientific method " or " logical positivism " or " Popperian falsificationism " or " methodological naturalism . "
But this tactic always leads to trouble .
Science is a messy human endeavor , notoriously hard to boil down to cut - and - dried procedures .
A much better strategy , I think , is to consider specific examples , figure out what kinds of questions science can reasonably address , and compare those to the questions in which we 're interested .
Here is my favorite example question .
Alpha Centauri
A is a G - type star a little over four light years away .
Now pick some very particular moment one billion years ago , and zoom in to the precise center of the star .
Protons and electrons are colliding with each other all the time .
Consider the collision of two electrons nearest to that exact time and that precise point in space .
Now let 's ask : was momentum conserved in that collision ?
Or , to make it slightly more empirical , was the magnitude of the total momentum after the collision within one percent of the magnitude of the total momentum before the collision ?
This is n't supposed to be a trick question ; I do n't have any special knowledge or theories about the interior of Alpha Centauri that you do n't have .
The scientific answer to this question is : of course , the momentum was conserved .
Conservation of momentum is a principle of science that has been tested to very high accuracy by all sorts of experiments , we have every reason to believe it held true in that particular collision , and absolutely no reason to doubt it ; therefore , it 's perfectly reasonable to say that momentum was conserved .
A stickler might argue , well , you should n't be so sure .
You did n't observe that particular event , after all , and more importantly there 's no conceivable way that you could collect data at the present time that would answer the question one way or the other .
Science is an empirical endeavor , and should remain silent about things for which no empirical adjudication is possible .
But that 's completely crazy .
That 's not how science works .
Of course we can say that momentum was conserved .
Indeed , if anyone were to take the logic of the previous paragraph seriously , science would be a completely worthless endeavor , because we could never make any statements about the future .
Predictions would be impossible , because they have n't happened yet , so we do n't have any data about them , so science would have to be silent .
All that is completely mixed - up , because science does not proceed phenomenon by phenomenon .
Science constructs theories , and then compares them to empirically - collected data , and decides which theories provide better fits to the data .
The definition of " better " is notoriously slippery in this case , but one thing is clear : if two theories make the same kinds of predictions for observable phenomena , but one is much simpler , we 're always going to prefer the simpler one .
The definition of theory is also occasionally troublesome , but the humble language should n't obscure the potential reach of the idea : whether we call them theories , models , hypotheses , or what have you , science passes judgment on ideas about how the world works .
And that 's the crucial point .
Science does n't do a bunch of experiments concerning colliding objects , and say " momentum was conserved in that collision , and in that one , and in that one , " and stop there .
It does those experiments , and then it also proposes frameworks for understanding how the world works , and then it compares those theoretical frameworks to that experimental data , and -- if the data and theories seem good enough -- passes judgment .
The judgments are necessarily tentative -- one should always be open to the possibility of better theories or surprising new data -- but are no less useful for that .
Furthermore , these theoretical frameworks come along with appropriate domains of validity , depending both on the kinds of experimental data we have available and on the theoretical framework itself .
At the low energies available to us in laboratory experiments , we are very confident that baryon number ( the total number of quarks minus antiquarks ) is conserved in every collision .
But we do n't necessarily extend that to arbitrarily high energies , because it 's easy to think of perfectly sensible extensions of our current theoretical understanding in which baryon number might very well be violated -- indeed , it 's extremely likely , since there are a lot more quarks than antiquarks in the observable universe .
In contrast , we believe with high confidence that electric charge is conserved at arbitrarily high energies .
That 's because the theoretical underpinnings of charge conservation are a lot more robust and inflexible than those of baryon - number conservation .
A good theoretical framework can be extremely unforgiving and have tremendous scope , even if we 've only tested it over a blink of cosmic time here on our tiny speck of a planet .
The same logic applies , for example , to the highly contentious case of the multiverse .
The multiverse is n't , by itself , a theory ; it 's a prediction of a certain class of theories .
If the idea were simply " Hey , we do n't know what happens outside our observable universe , so maybe all sorts of crazy things happen , " it would be laughably uninteresting .
By scientific standards , it would fall woefully short .
But the point is that various theoretical attempts to explain phenomena that we directly observe right in front of us -- like gravity , and quantum field theory -- lead us to predict that our universe should be one of many , and subsequently suggest that we take that situation seriously when we talk about the " naturalness " of various features of our local environment .
The point , at the moment , is not whether there really is or is not a multiverse ; it's that the way we think about it and reach conclusions about its plausibility is through exactly the same kind of scientific reasoning we 've been using for a long time now .
Science does n't pass judgment on phenomena ; it passes judgment on theories .
The reason why we can be confident that momentum was conserved during that particular collision a billion years ago is that science has concluded ( beyond reasonable doubt , although not with metaphysical certitude ) that the best framework for understanding the world is one in which momentum is conserved in all collisions .
It 's certainly possible that this particular collision was an exception ; but a framework in which that were true would necessarily be more complicated , without providing any better explanation for the data we do have .
We 're comparing two theories : one in which momentum is always conserved , and one in which it occasionally is n't , including a billion years ago at the center of Alpha Centauri .
Science is well equipped to carry out this comparison , and the first theory wins hands - down .
Now let 's turn to a closely analogous question .
There is some historical evidence that , about two thousand years ago in Galilee , a person named Jesus was born to a woman named Mary , and later grew up to be a messianic leader and was eventually crucified by the Romans .
( Unruly bloke , by the way -- tended to be pretty doctrinaire about the number of paths to salvation , and prone to throwing moneychangers out of temples .
Not very " accommodating , " if you will . )
The question is : how did Mary get pregnant ?
One approach would be to say : we just do n't know .
We were n't there , do n't have any reliable data , etc .
Should just be quiet .
The scientific approach is very different .
We have two theories .
One theory is that Mary was a virgin ; she had never had sex before becoming pregnant , or encountered sperm in any way .
Her pregnancy was a miraculous event , carried out through the intervention of the Holy Ghost , a spiritual manifestation of a triune God .
The other theory is that Mary got pregnant through relatively conventional channels , with the help of ( one presumes ) her husband .
According to this theory , claims to the contrary in early ( although not contemporary ) literature are , simply , erroneous .
There 's no question that these two theories can be judged scientifically .
One is conceptually very simple ; all it requires is that some ancient texts be mistaken , which we know happens all the time , even with texts that are considerably less ancient and considerably better corroborated .
The other is conceptually horrible ; it posits an isolated and unpredictable deviation from otherwise universal rules , and invokes a set of vaguely - defined spiritual categories along the way .
By all of the standards that scientists have used for hundreds of years , the answer is clear : the sex - and - lies theory is enormously more compelling than the virgin - birth theory .
The same thing is true for various other sorts of miraculous events , or claims for the immortality of the soul , or a divine hand in guiding the evolution of the universe and / or life .
These phenomena only make sense within a certain broad framework for understanding how the world works .
And that framework can be judged against others in which there are no miracles etc .
And , without fail , the scientific judgment comes down in favor of a strictly non-miraculous , non-supernatural view of the universe .
That 's what 's really meant by my claim that science and religion are incompatible .
I was referring to the Congregation - for - the - Causes - of - the - Saints interpretation of religion , which entails a variety of claims about things that actually happen in the world ; not the it 's - all - in - our - hearts interpretation , where religion makes no such claims .
( I have no interest in arguing at this point in time over which interpretation is " right . " )
When religion , or anything else , makes claims about things that happen in the world , those claims can in principle be judged by the methods of science .
That 's all .
Well , of course , there is one more thing : the judgment has been made , and views that step outside the boundaries of strictly natural explanation come up short .
By " natural " I simply mean the view in which everything that happens can be explained in terms of a physical world obeying unambiguous rules , never disturbed by whimsical supernatural interventions from outside nature itself .
The preference for a natural explanation is not an a priori assumption made by science ; it 's a conclusion of the scientific method .
We know enough about the workings of the world to compare two competing big - picture theoretical frameworks : a purely naturalistic one , versus one that incorporates some sort of supernatural component .
To explain what we actually see , there 's no question that the naturalistic approach is simply a more compelling fit to the observations .
Could science , through its strategy of judging hypotheses on the basis of comparison with empirical data , ever move beyond naturalism to conclude that some sort of supernatural influence was a necessary feature of explaining what happens in the world ?
Sure ; why not ?
If supernatural phenomena really did exist , and really did influence things that happened in the world , science would do its best to figure that out .
It 's true that , given the current state of data and scientific theorizing , the vast preponderance of evidence comes down in favor of understanding the world on purely natural terms .
But that 's not to say that the situation could not , at least in principle , change .
Science adapts to reality , however it presents itself .
At the dawn of the 20th century , it would have been hard to find a more firmly accepted pillar of physics than the principle of determinism : the future can , in principle , be predicted from the present state .
The experiments that led us to invent quantum mechanics changed all that .
Moving from a theory in which the present uniquely determines the future to one where predictions are necessarily probabilistic in nature is an incredible seismic shift in our deep picture of reality .
But science made the switch with impressive rapidity , because that 's what the data demanded .
Some stubborn folk tried to recover determinism at a deeper level by inventing more clever theories -- which is exactly what they should have done .
But ( to make a complicated story simple ) they did n't succeed , and scientists learned to deal .
It 's not hard to imagine a similar hypothetical scenario playing itself out for the case of supernatural influences .
Scientists do experiments that reveal anomalies that can't be explained by current theories .
( These could be subtle things at a microscopic level , or relatively blatant manifestations of angels with wings and flaming swords . )
They struggle to come up with new theories that fit the data within the reigning naturalist paradigm , but they do n't succeed .
Eventually , they agree that the most compelling and economical theory is one with two parts : a natural part , based on unyielding rules , with a certain well - defined range of applicability , and a supernatural one , for which no rules can be found .
Of course , that phase of understanding might be a temporary one , depending on the future progress of theory and experiment .
That 's perfectly okay ; scientific understanding is necessarily tentative .
In the mid-19th century , before belief in atoms had caught on among physicists , the laws of thermodynamics were thought to be separate , autonomous rules , in addition to the crisp Newtonian laws governing particles .
Eventually , through Maxwell and Boltzmann and the other pioneers of kinetic theory , we learned better , and figured out how thermodynamic behavior could be subsumed into the Newtonian paradigm through statistical mechanics .
One of the nice things about science is that it 's hard to predict its future course .
Likewise , the need for a supernatural component in the best scientific understanding of the universe might evaporate -- or it might not .
Science does n't assume things from the start ; it tries to deal with reality as it presents itself , however that may be .
This is where talk of " methodological naturalism " goes astray .
Paul Kurtz defines it as the idea that " all hypotheses and events are to be explained and tested by reference to natural causes and events . "
That " explained and tested " is an innocent - looking mistake .
Science tests things empirically , which is to say by reference to observable events ; but it does n't have to explain things as by reference to natural causes and events .
Science explains what it sees the best way it can -- why would it do otherwise ?
The important thing is to account for the data in the simplest and most useful way possible .
There 's no obstacle in principle to imagining that the normal progress of science could one day conclude that the invocation of a supernatural component was the best way of understanding the universe .
Indeed , this scenario is basically the hope of most proponents of Intelligent Design .
The point is not that this could n't possibly happen -- it 's that it has n't happened in our actual world .
In the real world , by far the most compelling theoretical framework consistent with the data is one in which everything that happens is perfectly accounted for by natural phenomena .
No virgin human births , no coming back after being dead for three days , no afterlife in Heaven , no supernatural tinkering with the course of evolution .
You can define " religion " however you like , but you can't deny the power of science to reach far - reaching conclusions about how reality works .

What goes through your mind in the moments as you raise your digital camera up to take a shot and before you press the shutter ?
If you ’re like many digital photographers you ’re not thinking about too much – you just want to capture the moment and then move on .
However getting in the habit of asking some simple questions can help take your images to the next level .
Here ’s 10 questions to get in the habit of asking while framing your shots .
I ’ve included links in each one to further reading on the topics .
I hope you find them helpful :
1 . What story am I telling ?
This is an important question and one that should help you to make any number of decisions in terms of composition , framing , exposure etc .
In essence what you ’re asking is ‘ why am I taking this shot ?
What is it ’s purpose and what am I trying to convey ? ’
Is it purely a way to keep a record of a moment , are you trying to capture the emotion of a moment , is it possibly a shot to give to someone , is it part of a larger series of shots or will it be the only shot to commemorate the moment etc .
Read more on telling stories with photos
2 . What is the visual focal point of this shot ?
What will viewers of this picture naturally have their eye drawn to in this scene ?
Once you ’ve identified this focal point you can think about where to place it in the frame ( consider the rule of thirds for example ) .
There are a variety of ways that you can enhance a focal point – some of which we explore here .
3 . What competing focal points are there ?
Once you ’ve identified what you do want your viewers eyes to be drawn towards and have placed it in the frame – scan your eyes over the shot and see if there are any competing focal points and ask yourself whether they add to or take away from the image ?
Secondary focal points can add depth to shots but they can also be very distracting and so you might need to reposition yourself or adjust your focal length and / or depth of field to accommodate or remove them from your shots ( read more on removing clutter from photography ) .
Also keep in mind that if your shot has more than one focal point that it might be worth taking two shots , one of each focal point , in order to keep things simple .
4 . What is in the background and foreground ?
One of most common places for distractions in digital photography is the background of your shots .
Run your eyes over the space behind your subject to see what else is in the image ( do the same for the foreground ) .
Consider whether you want the background in focus or nice and blurry .
Read more on getting backgrounds right .
5 . Am I close enough ?
Another common mistake in digital photography is taking shots where your subject is too small in the frame .
Shots that fill the frame with your subject tend to be much more dynamic and show a lot more detail of your subject .
To get this effect you have the option of moving yourself closer , moving your subject closer or using a longer focal length to give the effect of closeness .
Read more on filling your frame .
6 . What is the main source of light ?
Always give consideration to how your subject is lit .
Without light you ’ll lose detail and clarity in your image and your camera will have to compensate by doing things like increasing ISO and lengthening shutter speeds ( which could lead to noisy and blurred images ) .
What is the main source of light , where is it coming from , is there enough light , do you need artificial light sources ( flash etc ) , do you need to stabilize your camera on a tripod to stop camera shake due to low light etc .
Read more on using artificial light here and here as well as photographing moving subjects in low light conditions .
7 . Is my Framing Straight ?
It ’s amazing how many otherwise good photos are spoiled by framing that is slightly offline .
Sloping horizons and slightly leaning people or buildings should always be in the back of your mind to check .
Read more on getting horizons horizontal and getting other lines straight .
Also related to this question is that of ‘ Am I holding my Camera correctly ? ‘
Many people do n’t and as a result suffer from camera shake and framing mistakes .
8 . What other perspectives could I capture this subject from ?
Put 10 digital camera owners in front of a scene and most of them will take exactly the same shot from the same position .
Make your images stand out from the crowd by challenging yourself to not only take the standard shots that everyone else will get but to find creative and fresh angles and perspectives to shoot from .
Read more on adding variety to your Digital Photography .
9 . How would holding the camera in the other format change this shot ?
Many photographers get into the habit of always holding their camera the same way ( horizontally / landscape or vertically / portrait ) .
While it ’s OK to have a preference one way or the other it ’s also worth remembering that changing the format can drastically change the impact of the shot .
Do n’t forget you can also hold your camera at an angle for an effective result too .
10 .
How will the eye travel through this image ?
This is related to asking about focal points but gets in touch with the fact that while you ’re photographing a still image your viewers eyes do n’t remain still as they look at an image .
People tend to follow lines and are attracted to shapes and colors so considering all of these different visual elements and cues can help improve your shots considerably .
Read more on horizontal , vertical and diagonal lines and how they impact a shot .
Of course you probably wo n’t remember all the questions and you ’re unlikely to go through each of them with every shot you take – however next time you head out with your digital camera concentrate on asking yourself at least one or two of them as you take your shots .
As you do you ’ll find that they become more automatic and in time you ’ll naturally take digital photography shots that take into account all of these elements .

August 19 , 2009 --
The were two big winners at the recent “ town hall ” healthcare meeting held in the North Bronx , New York City , neighbourhood of Parkchester on August 17 – the lunatic right wing and the private health insurance industry .
These victories came despite the fact that the vast majority of those who lined up to participate in the meeting supported either a single - payer system or a public option .
Most came away disappointed .
I got kicked out .
The right wing won this contest without even participating in it .
Sure there was one woman with a “ Freedom Is n’t Free Shirt ” , but there were certainly none of the antics that have come to typify other ``town hall '' meetings .
Not even one “ Death Panel ” sign .
How then did the right wing win ?
Democrat Representative Joseph Crowley , the organiser of the event , guaranteed this by closing off all space for public discussion .
Instead of a town hall meeting , where constituents can ask questions or make speeches from the floor , Crowley was only willing to meet people one - on - one in “ private ” meetings .
Barricades on both sides of the Metropolitan Oval Park sectioned off the crowd .
A slew of private security guards and NYPD officers enforced the distance .
The right wing 's tactics had worked .
Crowley was too scared to hold an open meeting .
Industry funding
Before I left for the meeting I did a quick Internet search to see who I was dealing with .
Crowley has certainly dipped into the health industry pot for campaign funding .
The Center for Responsive Politics reports that he received $ 5000 contributions from Pfizer , Abbott Technologies ( a pharmaceutical company ) and the private health insurance company Blue Cross / Blue Shield .
No surprise then that Crowley has avoided the single - payer bill in the US House of Representatives ( HR 676 ) and has provided only tepid support for the public option in the Bill .
The literature he distributed makes no mention of a public option .
It contains only vague claims about increased regulation and cost reduction .
Now to my story .
For the last two years I have been organising in support of single - payer healthcare .
With more than 45 million people without health insurance , millions more underinsured and nearly 20,000 deaths from treatable conditions , the US healthcare system is clearly broken .
The responsible party is the private health insurance industry .
Single payer , or the National Health Insurance Act , would make private health insurance companies illegal and establish the federal government as the single - payer .
As a result , every person in the country would be guaranteed access to healthcare regardless of their ability to pay .
As an organiser , this has been a complicated campaign .
Everyone knows the healthcare system is a wreck .
Yet few understand how this failed system continues to perpetuate itself through advertising , monopolising market share and political campaign contributions .
The language of ``reform '' has also served to confuse .
The House healthcare bill and President Barack Obama continually talk about a “ public option ” and “ universal healthcare ” .
Many conflate these terms with single payer .
There is , in fact , no relation between them .
Obama initiated his healthcare campaign during the larger presidential campaign when he introduced the term “ universal health care ” to voters .
Now that the time has come to shift from rhetoric to policy , we find that his version of universal only includes a “ public option ” .
The public option would be a federally funded plan which would “ compete ” against other private plans in new “ health insurance exchanges ” .
People not currently able to afford healthcare could either opt into the public plan or receive “ credits ” ( read public funds ) to buy a private plan .
Obama claims that the very presence of the public option in the exchanges will force the private health insurance corporations to reduce the cost of the insurance plans they offer .
However , the only way for an insurance plan to reduce costs is to skimp on coverage or offer high deductible , high co-pay plans .
In fact , a recent article in Mother Jones magazine described the “ insurance exchanges ” as a plan concocted by the right - wing Heritage Foundation .
These very same exchanges have been implemented and are in the process of failing in Massachusetts .
Obama is therefore , once again , attempting to implement a right - wing scheme which uses taxpayers ' money to save a failing private industry .
There is simply nothing “ universal ” about the “ public option ” .
While in line to speak to representative Crowley , I met a blogger , Eve NYC , from the Daily KOS , who offered to video my talk with Crowley .
She knew that my confronting him with his health industry campaign contributions might be the high point of the otherwise vanilla one - on - one meetings .
I told Crowley ’s assistants that I wanted my session with Crowley taped by Eve .
They refused , claiming that the press was not allowed to enter , that the public park was an extension of Crowley ’s office .
I argued that this was ridiculous , that it was a public park and that I , and the journalist , had 1st Amendment rights that could not be suspended by his edict .
I was immediately descended upon by a team of aides and security guards .
I demanded to see Crowley directly and was eventually allowed to enter .
Crowley and I engaged in a borderline juvenile back - and - forth , in which he claimed his folding chair in the park was his office .
I went with the obvious – water fountains , dog walkers , tweeting birds , benches – it was a public park .
And he was a public official who should be accustomed , if not willing , to be videotaped .
What did he have to hide ?
After a few heated words of outrage , I was surrounded by security and decided to head off to the mini-stardom which awaited me back on the line .
[ You can watch Billy 's encounter with the ``Democrat '' Crowley HERE . ]
My conflict with Crowley demonstrates that single - payer activists and even democratic socialists have roles to play in the town hall meetings .
We should first make sure that they are really democratic ; that public officials are not hiding behind barricades , but are forced to face the public .
We also have an important educational role to play – patiently explaining the universal benefits offered by single - payer healthcare .
Finally , we should expose both Democrats and Republicans for what many of them really are – paid spokespeople for pharmaceutical companies and private health insurers .
The website OpenSecrets.org offers all the resources you need .
Educate , agitate and organise .
Timeless injunctions that will serve you well at any town hall meeting , or even , at a town hall charade .

Over one million people are holding their breath , waiting to see if Congress helps them .
Time to start making calls :
Over the coming months , as many as 1.5 million jobless Americans will exhaust their unemployment insurance benefits , ending what for some has been a last bulwark against foreclosures and destitution .
Because of emergency extensions already enacted by Congress , laid - off workers in nearly half the states can collect benefits for up to 79 weeks , the longest period since the unemployment insurance program was created in the 1930s .
But unemployment in this recession has proved to be especially tenacious , and a wave of job - seekers is using up even this prolonged aid .
Tens of thousands of workers have already used up their benefits , and the numbers are expected to soar in the months to come , reaching half a million by the end of September and 1.5 million by the end of the year , according to new projections by the National Employment Law Project , a private research group .
Unemployment insurance is now a lifeline for nine million Americans , with payments averaging just over $ 300 per week , varying by state and work history .
While many recipients find new jobs before exhausting their benefits , large numbers in the current recession have been unable to find work for a year or more .
Yep .
I 've had exactly one job interview in an entire year .

( CNN ) --
There is no fan like a " Twilighter . "
Fans bought " Twilight " birth certificates , cast head shots and spoofed magazine covers at Atlanta 's TwiTour .
more photos »
Their passion is the stuff of legends .
If you throw a convention -- or if you 're just selling T - shirts related to Stephenie Meyer 's best - selling vampire novels , for that matter -- they will descend by the thousands .
" Twilight " lovers were such a force at last year 's Comic - Con , Creation Entertainment , the franchise behind " Star Trek " conventions , immediately began putting together plans for fans of the goth - lite love story .
" We saw the reaction that it got , and that this was going to be something really huge ; the fans are extremely passionate , " said Creation Entertainment CEO Gary Berman .
See photos from the TwiTour »
Followers of the teen vampire romance also earned a reputation last year for claiming seats at Comic - Con -- the huge San Diego - based sci- fi , fantasy and comic book convention -- a day in advance and then not moving a muscle .
To avoid a repeat performance , this year Comic - Con changed its original Thursday schedule , holding off a panel for James Cameron 's " Avatar " -- the long - awaited new film from the " Terminator " and " Titanic " director -- until after footage from the upcoming " Twilight " film , " New Moon , " is revealed .
" ' Twilight ' fans are very intense , " said Lori Joffs , creator of the Stephenie Meyer - approved fan site TwilightLexicon.com .
" [ Comic - con ] knew that ' Twilight ' fans would sit there all day , and the fans of the [ ' Avatar ' ] series would n't get a seat . "
But now that Robert Pattinson , better known as sexy vampire - in - charge Edward , is confirmed to be on the " New Moon " Q&A panel , who knows whether the screaming will die down in time for the next panel to start ?
Something about the " Twilight " series causes a thirst that can't be quenched .
Despite the fact that the next book in the saga is on hold and the next film , " New Moon , " wo n't hit theaters until late November , fan conventions have been going strong all summer in cities across the nation .
And if you think it 's just the tween crowd behind this , think again .
TwiTour , a weekend - long celebration , sounds like it would be reminiscent of a high school pep rally : raucous cheering with scads of teenage girls .
But while there was plenty of screaming at the July 12 TwiTour in Atlanta , there were also plenty of women and a sprinkling of men who were unashamed that they were way beyond high school .
" It 's the pure innocence of newfound love , " explained 36 - year - old fan Kimberly Hunt , who 's not only read all four books , but also the 12 unfinished chapters of " Midnight Sun , " a novel from the view of main vampire Edward 's perspective , that are up on Stephenie Meyer 's Web site .
" Chivalry 's dead , and you do n't see it anymore .
It takes you back to the days of your first love . "
Hunt stopped in for the last day of the TwiTour convention sans husband and kids .
Although Hunt explained to her husband that she would be spending her Sunday with " Twilight " -- which came with a $ 42 admission fee -- she neglected to mention that she would also be shelling out $ 40 for a photo with Kellan Lutz , the actor who plays Emmett Cullen .
Hunt was so intent to get to meet Lutz she gladly joined the end of a line that easily held 400 others in front of her .
Compared with the younger fans , who can stroll into their age - appropriate section of a bookstore to find the series , adult " Twilight " fans occur by happenstance .
But once it does , it 's a domino effect : a co-worker , sister , kid 's kindergarten teacher or friend will pass it on with urgent recommendations .
" I bought the first two books for my boss , " said 38 - year - old Kathy Campbell , " and she read them and said ' that 's the best love story , you have to read them . ' "
After a bit of speculation , Campbell tried the books out for herself , and has now gotten her 29 - year - old sister , Marie , addicted as well .
But it 's not just the love story , fans say .
Although the books have been criticized for their literary quality , fans insist it 's not just the tale , but the way it 's told .
" Any ' Twilight ' fan can tell you that they 've been written so well , that they 're real , " said John Henson , a 33 - year - old costume designer who collects original clothing from the film .
" It was the second book , ' New Moon , ' that made me a fan .
It was chapter three , and it was the breakup of Bella and Edward ; it hit me so hard emotionally that I had to cancel dinner with friends .
At that point I was 29 , 30 years old , and to make me cry ?
That 's when I knew Stephenie Meyer was a brilliant writer . "
For Joffs , the 35 - year - old creator of TwilightLexicon.com , that ability translates into something she can feel passionate about even after a failed marriage .
" It saved me , because of the friends I made and the support that I 've gotten .
I get to go to these conventions , and it gives me something to keep going , " she said .
" You need something more than just kids , you need something for you . "
The fans are fervent enough that " Twilight " conventions will likely go on for years , Joffs said .
" A woman picks up the book , expects it to be nothing much , kind of rolls her eyes , and then they get completely sucked in , " she said .
" It 's something about that book , something about the way Stephenie Meyer wrote the books .
I can't see it dying down anytime soon . "
All About Movies
The recent creepy incident involving Amazon remotely removing purchased content from the Kindle has me back on the fence regarding purchasing one .
There are contradictory forces at work here .
First , as a geek , I ’m unable to sleep when I do not own the latest cool .
The first Kindle ’s industrial design was intriguing , but the second version nailed it .
The second generation is a pleasure to hold and to read and I ’m a fan of anything that gives me a reason to read more .
But here ’s the contradiction :
My office bookshelf .
Slightly in disarray , but a massive visual reminder of what I love about books … you hold them .
When a Kindle - maniac is running down their list of compelling reasons to purchase , they inevitably invoke the “ that ’s what your parents said about CDs ” argument .
Remember that ?
A generation of music lovers decrying the death of vinyl because the CD ’s size did n’t do justice to the cover art ?
The cover is part of music .
Sure .
It ’s not about the song ; it ’s about the album as a WHOLE .
Maybe .
Ok , yes , I love listening to the entire Dark Side of the Moon , and yeah , that prism cover is bitchin’ , but the main difference between a book and an album or a CD is you hold a book when you read it .
If you want something from a book , you need to touch it .
Part of the reason I read Catcher in the Rye once a year has to do with the ratty , dusty - smelling version I own .
Part of the character of a book is how it is read .
But a technological evolution away from books , for me , presents an even larger social problem .
More People Less
The name is Rands .
It ’s not my real name ; it ’s a leftover from the mid-90s when everyone was still freaked out about typing their real name into the computer , let alone the Internet .
A quick scan of my Twitter stream reveals that apparently real names have replaced nicknames as a means of identification , but this does n’t change the fact that never in our history have we known more people less .
We spend the day swimming in the 10 % of the information that others have deliberately chosen to share with us and while it is overwhelming in volume , it ’s only so because there are so many people … who are actually sharing very little .
There is a time and a place that I want to know more , and no amount of Facebook updates is going to placate this curiosity .
Perhaps this is a function of my generation , but there are two defining moments for me in the getting - to - know - you phase of a relationship :
# 1 Can you talk shit ?
I ’m not talking bland sarcasm , I ’m talking about a full court comedy offensive that demonstrates not only that you are aware of your surroundings , but you have a gift for improvisation and the courage to use it .
# 2 Where ’s your bookshelf ?
It ’s this awkward moment whenever I first walk into your home .
Where is it ?
Everyone has one .
It might not be huge .
It might be hidden in a closet , but in decades of meeting new people , I ’ve never failed in finding one and when I do I consume it .
See , I do n’t really trust you until we talk a little shit and then I see your bookshelf .
The Book Stalking Process
This is my process and this is not a process of judgment , but one of assessment , and it proceeds in three phases :
Phase 1 : Where are they ?
Where does you bookshelf live in your home ?
Is it in an obvious place or are you hiding it ?
Why are you hiding your books ?
Is the bookshelf built around the room or vice versa ?
Do you have a room specifically for books ?
Hot .
Can I see your bookshelf after you ’ve sat me down with a glass of wine ?
Even better .
Did you spend money on your bookshelf or is it an IKEA atrocity ?
Wait , you built that ?
Awesome .
Phase 2 : How are they arranged ?
Have you committed to a pure bookshelf ?
What ’s the breakdown between books and non-books ?
This is n’t where I store books ; it ’s where I demonstrate that I love books .
Is the arrangement chaotic or calm ?
Is this is a shrine or a utility ?
Vertical or horizontal stacking ?
What ’s the rule ?
Is there a rule ?
Is it full ?
I read .
A lot .
Does your book arrangement tell a story ?
Can I find that story quickly or do I need you to tell it ?
Do you offer it ?
Do you use bookends ?
Are they functional or ornate ?
What ’s their story ?
Phase 3 : And what do you read ?
Are these the books I expect based on what I know about you ?
Do these books represent your entire life or just right now ?
Can I tell , at a glance , the three most important books ?
Which books are you… hiding ?
How do you react when you see me stalking your bookshelf ?
What ’s the first story you ’re going to tell ?
Is there a glaringly obvious book that does not belong ?
When do I get to ask you about it ?
What I ’m learning during this stalking is my deal .
The intricacies of my assessment are n’t the point .
You are decidedly and blissfully not me , which is why I ’m standing , wine glass in hand , totally and completely lost in your bookshelf .
Dr. Seuss and Calvin and Hobbes… interspersed on single shelf .
That … is fucking brilliant .
Seven Precious Books
As you grow up , the guarantee is that the world will change , often faster than you are comfortable with .
There are two approaches to handling change : either you embrace the change because the change has something to teach you , or you can dig your heels in and say , “ Nope , not changing .
What worked for me then works for me now and will work for me later . ”
It ’s my job to observe and embrace change , but I ’ve always wondered when I ’d grow stubborn enough to hold onto something the next generation had begun to view as an antique .
This is what you need to know .
I have three shelves .
There ’s one in the closet that you ’ll never see .
It ’s full of trashy science fiction , gifts I ’ve never read , and an embarrassingly large collection of Far Side books .
The second shelf is the one you see above , a place of honor .
These are the books that I read once a year , these are the books that I ’ll have for the rest of my life .
And then there ’s the small shelf next to the bed .
Seven precious books .
A few I ’m reading right now and a few … I just need nearby .
See , I ca n’t imagine a world without books .

Las vibras de Fox E l 6 de marzo de este año publiqué en La Jornada un artículo titulado :
Fox , ¿ahora , escuela para políticos ?
Hoy le informo que el fin de semana pasado se graduó la primera generación del máster en prácticas políticas en el Centro Fox ( ¿prácticas o mañas ? ) .
En la clausura , los futuros gobernantes , quienes salen con una preparación de cinco meses ( ¡ Dios nos ampare ! ) , fueron despedidos por el Fox de siempre ; el ranchero inepto y bribón descrito hace dos semanas por Carlos Fuentes .
Recordará que en esa ocasión
Fox , ofendido y con faltas de ortografía , increpó a Fuentes exigiéndole que tuviera honestidad intelectual ( ¡miren quién habla ! ) .
¿ Dónde está la bribonería ? , preguntó ( de la ineptitud no dijo ni pío : le sacó al bulto ) .
Fuentes le contestó como se merecía , con un acertijo literario : “ uso bribón en la primera acepción del Diccionario de la Real Academia : “ haragán ” .
No insulto : defino ” .

Impresiones sobre China
A rmonía es el término que más se escucha entre funcionarios y académicos chinos cuando se trata de caracterizar la realidad actual del país , aunque mucho de lo que ocurre está lejos de ese autoconvocado equilibrio neoconfuciano .
Se considera , por ejemplo , que las relaciones laborales se basan precisamente en esa deseada avenencia entre trabajo y capital , la cual sin duda existe en muchas regiones en las que la economía de mercado se ha impuesto con beligerancia y acompañada de una ideología empresarial fuertemente competitiva y arraigada , sobre todo entre los jóvenes que no vivieron los avatares de la revolución .

Well , the company finally has made a statement .
Korean web portal DC News did a phone interview with the publisher .
" Debating ( as to if it 's a rip off or not ) is like having blind men touching an elephant and describing what it looks like , " said SK iMedia .
" We will reveal the gameplay soon .
Other than that , we have no comment at this time . "

Face Lift Plastic Surgery
As the aging process takes over , skin begins to lose its elasticity , resulting in loose , sagging skin of the face , jowls and chin .
A face lift plastic surgery improves the lower 1/3 of the face ; however , if you add an eyelid surgery and brow lift procedure it will improve the eyes and forehead area .
You can also add to the surgical procedure a plastic surgery neck lift .
A neck lift procedure improves drooping skin in the neck region .
The facelift plastic surgery , along with the eye lift surgery , brow lift and neck lift will cause a dramatic change in appearance from a saggy , baggy look to a more youthful appearance .
A great alternative to these cosmetic surgery options is to have laser treatments performed .
Laser skin resurfacing is a treatment that involves laser beams being utilized to burn the outer layer of facial skin , causing underlying collagen to tighten up .
When the skin ’s outer layer grows back , the result will be smoother , tighter - looking skin .
Laser treatments can also work to improve the fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes , forehead , cheeks , lips and neck regions .
Advantages of laser surgery over face lift cosmetic surgery includes no scarring , no blood loss , no general anesthesia , no cutting and time in an outpatient clinic instead of hospital setting .
On the other hand , for those who need to get rid of large volumes of extra skin , the face lift plastic surgery is necessary .
Costs
The cost of a face lift alone can start at about $ 6,000 .
But , if you add in the cost of other procedures , such as the eyelid surgery , brow lift and neck lift , that cost could go up to $ 25,000 and beyond .
The cost of laser treatments also depends on the size of the treated area and the number of treatments needed to correct the irregularities .
The average cost of laser resurfacing is $ 1,500 to $ 4,200 , depending on which type of laser was utilized .
Risks / Side Effects
Risks and side effects of a face lift plastic surgery include scarring , numbness , nerve damage , anesthesia allergic reactions , infection and bruising .
With laser skin resurfacing , complications are very uncommon , but do occur .
These complications include poor healing , pigmentation changes , excessive scarring , infection and allergic reactions to local anesthetics .
Recovery
A full recovery for a face lift plastic surgery cannot be seen until about two to three weeks .
During this period , bruising and swelling will dissipate and some activity will again be able to be resumed .
Normal numbness and muscle stiffness will still be present , but complete return of sensation could take several months .
Scars will fade after one year .
With laser resurfacing , recovery time will vary amongst patients .
Most individuals are back to work within 10 days .
Makeup can hide skin discoloration , but men will have to endure their public appearances .
Extended sun exposure should be avoided for up to 6 months .
Results
Facelifts , neck lifts , and laser resurfacing all have long lasting results .
There may be one human being on Earth who understands the TV show " Lost " -- a guy who claims he created the show 32 years ago .
Anthony Spinner -- a producer on " Baretta " and " Babes in Toyland " -- says back in 1977 he was paid $ 30,000 to write a TV pilot , which eventually became a 121 - page script called " Lost . "
Spinner is now suing ABC and Touchstone Television , claiming the network passed on the show in ' 77 , '91 and ' 94 ... then suddenly created an exact replica with Touchstone in 2004 .
Spinner lists a ton of similarities in his suit -- which was filed on July 10 -- notably an " airplane headed to Los Angeles [ that ] crashes into a tropical jungle - like environment . "
Spinner also alleges the new " Lost " characters -- including Jack , Locke , Sayid , Kate and Sawyer -- are all rip - offs ... down to their occupations and dark pasts .

Donate Stock
There are several tax advantages to making a charitable gift of appreciated securities .
You may hold appreciated stock and do n't intend to sell it primarily because of the substantial capital gains tax due when an individual sells the stock .
As an example , if you bought stock for $ 1,000 several years ago and it is now worth $ 20,000 .
If you sold the $ 20,000 stock , you would pay capital gains tax on the $ 19,000 gain in value .
However if you donate the stock you avoid paying capital gains tax and the full fair market value of stock qualifies for a charitable income tax deduction as permitted by law .
When the charity sells the stock , there is no capital gains tax due and the charity receives the full $ 20,000 .

On a personal level I found him to be an outstanding presence , a great communicator full of ideas , and upon meeting him you can immediately understand how he is able to wrangle cast and crew and get the best out of everyone . ”
We really want to go with a character driven action movie , because that ’s what we all remember about the original ‘ Predator , ’ and we want to take it even further with this .
I was already booked up as a director when this came back to me , but I still wanted to have a hand in making it .
So I lobbied to have the movie done through my studios so I could oversee it in a stronger position than a producer usually takes on .
We ’re still writing .
But it still involves a very intense group of people stranded on a Predator planet discovering unspeakable horrors ( that are not always from outside their group ) .
So like the original movie , the title does have a double meaning .
Aliens was a different take on the Alien idea , and an original movie in it ’s own right , and that ’s what we want to do with this .
As to how this movie will be viewed , one of the guys at Fox told me “ No one is ever going to talk about AVP again after this film , I will stake my life on it .
Failure is not an option .
will direct the forthcoming “ ” movie for producerthrough his Troublemaker Studios .
Rodriguez had pencilled in a fairly strong shortlist of directors that included ( The Descent ) , but ( Vacancy , Armored ) ultimately won out .
Rodriguez told Ain’t It Cool Regarding why Rodriguez chose not to helm the film himself , he said : Rodriguez also said that production will take place in Austin - Texas at Troublemaker Studios , taking advantage of the state ’s incentive program .
He did n’t wanna reveal too much of the story , for instance he says : “ Predators ” is scheduled for a July 7th , 2010 release .
DID MICHAEL ATTEND THIS WEDDING IN DISGUISE ?
The internet is on fire with the renewed hope that Michael Jackson may be alive .
A video emerged of a Jackson family wedding and one very interesting attendee .
Knowing Michael 's past history and fascination with disguises raises the question , " Just who is that bearded man in the video . "
Jackson fans have held the candle for his comeback now for over 7 years .
No entertainer has ever had this much impact on their fans or society .
Millions of fans world wide are still hoping to see him again .
Siggy Jackson , the son of Jackie Jackson – Michael ’s brother and Jackson Five member – got married to Toyia Parker at a small family ceremony held at someone 's house in Encino , California .
Michael 's kids Prince and Paris were there and many are saying that Michael himself may have been in attendance in an elaborate disguise .
Most of Michael 's most devoted fans remember a film he did in which he played " The Mayor .
" He was made up to look 20 yrs older and a lot heavier .
Fans who saw the movie could not even recognize Michael in his elaborate disguise .
Michael may have chosen to duplicate this disguise as a message to fans that he is still alive .
Could It Be Michael In The Backseat ?
Suddenly Michael Jackson Fans Worldwide are excited again .
It all has to do with an Instagram Post by Michael 's daughter Paris Jackson of her driving near Joshua Tree .
It took a while but slowly fans were able to make out some familiar features on the passenger in the back seat .
This was reported on in a YouTube video called " SHOCK !
Michael Jackson Seen Alive 2016 .
Take a look and tell us what you see .
We see someone who looks a lot like Michael .
Soon we will be revealing many more sightings in this new hot bed of celebrity sightings , the California High Desert .
It is an isolated and mostly desolate area that many celebrities go to hide out .
Recently Iggy Pop and Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age recorded an album in the 29 Palms Area .
Could the mysterious man in the backseat be none other than the amazing Michael Jackson ?
R eport Claims Michael Is In Canada
According to Empire News there are credible reports coming from Ontario , Canada that Michael Jackson is alive and well and living under an assumed name .
Empire reports that , " One week after reports of Jackson ’s death , a mysterious newcomer moved into a small bungalow near Ontario ’s Lake Doré .
According to a neighbor , a fleet of moving vans and a limousine pulled up in front of the property where a ‘ pale middle - aged male ’ was escorted into to the house , surrounded by what appeared to be 3 bodyguards . "
City records show the owner of the house is Alain P. Mysteriously no one has ever seen Alain and when people ask the servants reply that , " he is a very private man . " Meanwhile there are permits for exotic animals , shipments of costumes and cosmetics and whenever visitors do come they are escorted from the airport in a shroud of secrecy .
A contractor who was hired to do some work on the house claims that they are building a recording studio and hearing Alains voice it could very well be Michael .
The contractor who never saw Alain said he had the feeling that it was a famous person hiding out .
The truth remains to be seen , we only hope and pray it could be true .

COULD IT BE MICHAEL ?
We took this photo in Perth , Western Australia in a hotel hallway .
We were walking through a hallway when we bumped into someone .
When we bumped into them we were on SnapChat and must 've accidentally taken a photo and when we looked at the photo we realised it looked like Michael .
When we turned around the person was quickly walking away dressed in black .

Michael Seen In LV Elevator
I had never heard of your website , but I started searching Michael Jackson Alive on Google after what happened to me this morning !
Okay , I 'm in Las Vegas right now and so was I this morning .
I have stayed at Wynn Las Vegas for the last few nights .
This morning , I woke up very early ( 5:30 a .m. ) .
A little tired I decided to go downstairs and see if I could get breakfast somewhere .
I walked out of my room around 6 a.m. and as I walked into the hallway , I noticed another door opening not far away from me .
A few men walked out of the room , 2 big African American guys in casual clothing , a smaller African American guy with a small hatand the last one to come out of the room was a white man with a white skin .
He was wearing black clothes and leather jacket ( this was the first thing that I found odd about it , as it 's Vegas and very hot ) .
The next thing I noticed where his hands , they were pretty big and knuckled ( if that 's a word ?
English is not my first language ) .
I said ' hey ' , out of politeness but seemed to scare them as they heard it right behind them all of a sudden .
The smaller man with the hat said : 'elevator , come on come on !
'
And I did n't really understand what happened , I figured it was some kinda mob business so I stepped back to my room , walking slowly backwards .
Then , the white man dropped the key card to their room and kept walking .
One of the bigger guys saw this and ran straightly towards it and picked it up .
Meanwhile , Michael and the other two black men were already near the elevators ..
All of a sudden Michael turned around and I could see his face .
He had shorter hair than you see on the pictures and he looked at me kinda frightened , but then he started yelling to the big black guy that was picking up the key card : 'my book , I dropped my book !
'
The ( I asume ) bodyguard picked up a small black book ( some kinda note book ) and went to the elevator ..
A few seconds later they were gone .
I was very very confused by the entire thing , it all happened really really fast and I was still pretty tired so I was like : what the hell is going on here ?
I also expected some other guests on the floor to have woken up from the noise , because the running and yelling was pretty loud ..
I 'm Definitely 100 % Sure That I Saw Michael
I 'm definitely 100 % sure that I saw Michael !
I told a few people in the lobby but they would n't believe me and laughed , except for one woman who said she believed that he was maybe alive , and that I was lucky to have seen him ..
I know this sounds very very strange , and I 'm very confused , but i am sure that i saw Michael ..
I 'm probably gonna spend the rest of my day reading other stories on this website that seem to be the same as mine ..
If I remember anything else , I will send another email !

Who Really Died That Day ?
My name is Kelly A H. I am writing to let you know that Dimitrie D is the one that died in Michael Jackson 's place on 6/25/2009 .
Dimitrie was the one taken to UCLA hospital and admitted there under the name Soule S. Dimitrie was a 47 - year - old man who had terminal illness .
The paramedics said they thought the patient was terminally ill coming from hospice .
It was not Michael Joe Jackson that died but Dimitrie D instead .
Michael Jackson is still alive and we will see him perform again real soon in the flesh once he is healed and has his strength back .
God bless .
Sincerely , Kelly A H ( email received 6/13/14 )
editors note : the paramedics did not recognize the dead body as Michael Jackson ( see article below )

Then I Realized It Was Michael
I 'll never forget it was may 14 in Arizona .
I was visiting my dad .
I can't remember exactly where cause I 'm not from there but I took a drive to this small city my dad though I 'd like to see .
It was like a small town .
The farmers were nice , everyone knew everyone .
I walked up to this cart where a man was selling fruit .
I looked over and it was a group of guy in black .
Most were buff except one .
I thought it was strange because it was hot outside .
The smaller guy ( Michael ) turned around and walked right past me !
I caught a glimpse of his face and when I realized it was Michael I sat down because I was about to faint .
Has anyone else seem him recently ?
Anne S ( email received 6/7/14 )
I was driving through Lafayette , Indiana when I stopped at a park with trails leading into the woods .
I was doing my usual thing , jogging with my earphones in when I noticed two shadowy figures coming towards me about 100 feet away .
Nervous , I take out my earphones and wait with my hand on my knife that I always carry in my side holster .
As they approach I see one of them has long hair and is wearing sunglasses .
The voice was the same as the Michael Jackson I know and love .
I was in shock after I exchanged words with him , and he and his bodyguard continued down the trail .
I never thought I would see him again .
He truly is still out there and alive .
I know it was him .

Is Michael In Croatia ?
I do n't know how to begin , cus it 's a long story , I 'll just begin wherever , I do wanna share this with you !
I 'm afraid that this is what I wanted to see and not be what it really was .
I doubt about giving false hope to you .
But I decided to tell my story .
In croatia , august 2012 , I went on vacation in the neigborhood around Istria ( in a - province on the westcoast of croation and that area .
I visited several towns .
And in one town , I passed by someone very noticeable .
I have bad eyes , bad sight I mean and I did n't wear my glasses .
( as always , this moment I was really sorry for that )
Just let me go on .
I 'm really excited about this .
But I am not sure , let 's repeat that , I do n't want to spread lies !
I 've seen so many people passing by , it was a really hot day , and I moaned lots cus of the heat .
I do n't like the heat that much , so that 's why .
I 've seen so many people but did n't actually look at them .
I just looked around and hoped I could stop to cool down somewhere of the heat .
Then , on my right side a man passed by .
He walked the opposite way .
I know I had to tell this way earlier , but my English is bad and I was afraid that you should n't understand me .
I hope you do now !
He passed by very near , like less than a half meter away from me .
He looked like a homeless man .
He had a little bit dark skin , and curled hair .
He walked in a way Michael did .
I do n't know .
I just got a weird feeling by that .
He stood in a straight line now and I looked at his face .
Eyes as Michael's .
Eyebrows as Michael .
I got tears in my eyes and wanted to say Michael , but that would be weird if it should not 've been him !
I was in Croatia , and not many people understand English .
even more German , but Michael does n't except saying ich liebe dich mihr ( I love you more ) in german at a concert .
I really gotta cry !
I just stood still and my parents were far away already .
I looked back and saw him walking harder and harder .
I actually lost my parents out of sight and looked back to the man that seemed to be Michael .
I wanted to run after him but getting lost by myself as 14 yo that time in a unknown country would be scary .
I ran to my dad and asked him to stop or he walked in a little shop , I do n't remember , I 'm sorry .
I did n't want to tell this cus it sounds fake , but the feeling I got was real .
Like someone hold me and said :
Your search is finally completed !
But instead of that to be sure , cus ... ya it 's almost impossible cus 7 billion people living on earth , a huge fan meets Michael Jackson ... watcha thinking I thought .
When I look back I get chills down my spine again and regret going back to my dad !
When he looked in the shop or stopped for another reason ( I 'm sorry , it 's almost 2 years ago from right now - writers date , I ran back when I could , sooo hard !
I could n't see him and I actually wanted to scream !!!
I did n't know if Michael wanted to get recognized either of course ... maybe this must have been the best for him and did ai make the right decision .
Do n't be selfish and wish the best to Michael himself ! :) he totally deserves it !
It 's like I dreamt it !
But I did n't cus it's a place I 've been once , and the moment it happened , I made a little note about it on my nintendo 3ds .
It 's real !
Just to repeat , this is what I 've seen and believed .
When you want to see something , you 'll earlier see it ...
I hope it was Michael !
If so ... omg thanks to god !
so much !
I can't believe it that I may ve been the one who noticed michael !
I love him so much and do n't want to spread lies !

I was recently driving through Gary , Indiana .
I was becoming very tired so I stopped at a rest stop to use the bathroom and sleep for a little bit .
I went to the restroom and before I was pushed out I got a glimpse of the king of pop himself washing his hands .
The guards were very aggressive while pushing me out , but I had already seen him !
Please help spread my story !
I just want the world to know that Michael is really okay and is still out there .
Thank you for your time

I went down to Florida on a vacation and on our way drove through Gary , Indiana .
We stopped there for a meal and at the restaurant I saw Michael !
It was him !
He had bandages on his face and was with multiple other people .
I could n't snap a pic but i approached him and asked " is it really you , Michael ? "
He winked at me and walked out .
It was Michael !

Michael Jackson's Xscape
There is new Michael Jackson music coming out in May and once again it is shrouded in mystery and controversy .
One look at the cover picture and the message is clear .
Michael is climbing out of seclusion .
He is emerging from a cocoon .
He is beautiful and reborn and he will fly again .
One of Michael 's former producers was quite vocal about his belief that the King of Pop was still with us and we will see him perform again .
Could these posthumous CD's be Michael 's way of keeping in touch with fans from beyond the grave ?
No one will ever really know the pressures Michael faced and what could have driven him to Xscape .
PARAMEDICS COULD NOT Recognize MIchael
As unbelievable as it seems , paramedics who arrived at Michael Jackson 's mansion to save his life on June 25 , 2009 did not recognize the overdose victim as Michael Jackson .
In fact they thought the comatose man was a late stage cancer patient returning from hospice .
Was this the same Michael Jackson who sang and danced his heart out the night before at a Staples Center rehearsal for his upcoming 50 show run in London ?
The current civil trial between the Jackson Estate and AEG Concert promoters is bringing a lot of forgotten inconsistencies about Michael to light .
There seems to be two Michaels .
The one we all know and love , who was dancing , singing and gearing up for an incredible comeback and the other one , who was frail , weak , emaciated and eventually taken away by paramedics .
Could the master of all disguises have slipped away into the night and simply abandoned the character he so skillfully created .
That would be the greatest show of all time .
Last year flowers and Candles adorn Michael Jackson 's star on Hollywood Blvd. on this the darkest of anniversaries .
On June 25 , 2014 , it will be exactly five years from the day Michael disappeared from our lives .
We want him back .
The love has not even begun to fade .
Millions of fans from around the world are doing millions of tributes to the loveliest soul of all , Michael Jackson .
Many say he 's dead but we tend to question this .
There are too many unanswered questions and many of us have a strong gut feeling that yes , we will see him again .
If we keep the faith and live with respect to all living things as he espoused in so many songs , we feel he will return .
If you are curious read on .
This site is a tribute to the kindest man who ever lived , Michael Jackson .
Where Is The Missing Surveillance Tape ?
Michael Jackson had surveillance cameras all over his house .
He had to .
He lived under tight security .
On June 25 , 2009 at 12:45 AM his cameras recorded him arriving home for the last time .
LAPD experts have entered this snippet of tape as evidence in the Conrad Murray Trial .
But what about the next 24 hours of tape which would show exactly who came and went in the following crucial hours .
This tape is missing .
How is this possible ?
The best investigation team in the world is investigating the " death " of one of the most popular entertainers of all time and they forget to save the surveillance footage ?
Hmmmmmmm .......
Something seems a little fishy here .
Is there maybe something that they do n't want anyone to see ???
Could This Be Michael Jackson Alive in Paris ?
Who is that on the second floor ?
could it be ..........
MICHAEL JACKSON ????

Michael Jackson Seen At
Disney World
I am more than happy to have a chance to send you this e-mail .
Yesterday , in my family trip to Orlando , to go to Disney World , was the last day i was in Orlando from the 5 days i've been there .
And yet , it was the best day ever for me .
I would like to share this with you & the fans .
As me and my family left the hotel around 9 in the morning , to get early to the Disney theme park " Epcot " , we were riding in the car until we got to the " Epcot " parking lot .
When we got there , we found a parking space , and parked .
we all got out of the car , and we were about to cross a small street where cars drive by .
when you cross that street , you will see the main entrance of the park .
when we were all about to cross , this very big tall black car that looked a lot like a Cadillac Escalade , Parked in front of the main entrance , Instead of looking for a normal parking space .
I personally thought that was very strange because nobody parks that way .
Anyways ,
Me & my family had to keep moving on to get inside the theme park .
As we made a line for the entrance , everybody seemed to be talking loudly & facing one direction .
Everybody was looking at the strange black car that i mentioned earlier .
I turned around as well , to see what everybody was looking at .
What i saw was a man in a black satin suit that had dark glasses .
He came out of the drivers seat , & somehow looked at all of us that were looking at him .
He then turned to the backseat where he then opened the door , and ANOTHER man wearing the same suit as the first man came out .
That second man was holding an umbrella .
( We all know Michael uses umbrellas many times )
Well , the second man reached his hand inside , & grabbed the hand of the man i could swear was Michael .
The man that looked amazingly alot like Michael came slowly out of the car , i first noticed his shoes .
( They were black ) I then noticed the kind of clothing he was wearing , ( Black leather pants , black coat , dark sunglasses , something that looked like a scarf around his face , & a baseball cap . )
The people around me were wondering who that person was .
What was amazing , was that the two men who seemed to be security , seemed to have some type of special ID or another card of identification .
That one of them showed to the person who was in charge of giving out the tickets , which then led them to entering less than a minute inside the park .
The line i was in , was huge , but when i finally got through it , i was walking very quickly to see if i could possibly find that mystery person .
Sadly , i never had a chance to find him .
But there 's no doubt that was Michael .
Real fans like me , & others around the world really know how to tell when somebody is MJ or not .
I want everybody to keep beLIEving no matter what happens .
Always keep the faith like i'm keeping it !
Never give up !
I 'm sure he 's ABOUT to come back .
I know it !
I 'll never give up of course , & neither should none of you either .
I 'm counting on you guys to beLIEve .
He 'll be here soon !
But always remember the Love , The Faith , & TO BURN THE TABLOIDS !!
I love you all , All my love , Sandy xxx

I am not sure if this is true but if you look at the cover of ' Michael ' and Zoom to 400 and look at the bubble underneth the M it shows a door from a video on your sight in the abulance where he gets out .
and at the bottem left corner a little bit up and it says AFRICA and on his lips it says " i'm alive " i think it means to say " i am alive and in africa ... " i was exited when i found this out but it makes sense . :) from KB Saturday , February 5 , 2011 3:18 AM

Michael Jackson seen at Harrods
Hi . I was at Harrods , the store owned by Michael 's friend Mohammad al - Fayed , yesterday , Tuesday 18th January .
I was browsing the home furniture department with a friend who 's also a fan .
We were looking at some sofas and chairs .
It was during the day and there were n't many people around .
There was about 4 other shoppers in the particular section we were in .
While we were walking around , I noticed a member of staff talking to the other shoppers and each one walked off after he'd finished talking to them .
He then came up to me and my friend and asked us to leave the department for a short while .
I asked why and if we 'd done anything wrong .
All he said was there was a maintenance issue which had to be fixed and for health and safety reasons all customers would have to be out of the department .
It seemed a bit odd but we had no choice but to obey his order and leave .
As we went down the escalator , I told my friend that just for fun we should sneak back and have a look what they 're up to .
We took the escalator back up and quickly ran behind one of the sofas and waited to see if anyone would show up .
We waited about 5 minutes and nothing happened .
We got bored and were about to leave when a group of about 6 men in suits came through the doors .
We hid and tried to sneak the occasional look .
I heard one of the men say " Not yet , not yet " and after a minute another one said " Get him secure " and " Has the area been cleared ? " .
We did n't have a clue what was going on but we kept listening .
And then we heard a guy say " Mr al - Fayed said bring him straight to his office .
Secure him now " .
Another 5 minutes went past and we heard the doors open .
I caught a quick glimpse of someone in a dark suit and sunglasses come through the doors surrounded by burly men .
His hair was short but the features were unmistakeable .
One of the men said " Straight through !
Straight through ! " and the man they were protecting giggled .
I swear I recognised that giggle straightaway .
I tried to get another look but he was rushed through a side door .
I am certain that the man we saw was Michael Jackson .
He 's very close friends with Mohammad al - Fayed and he would definitely trust him enough to involve him in the hoax .

Is This Michael in Switzerland ?
" Hello ! - Someone I know had taken this picture in Switzerland on the Schildhorn .
( Around September 25 , 2009 ) -
When she took the picture she did not notice that this could be MJ . - Later she posted the picture on Facebook and stated that it could be MJ .
( She 's not a Fan of MJ ) - I do not know if she wants me to send you this - instead of asking her , I just sent it to you ( so she can't say no ) - Please do not give my mail address or my name to anyone else !
My personal view : I looked at this picture several times - it really is interesting .
Yesterday I decided that I 'll just sent it to you - so you can decide ...
I always thought that MJ is gone for sure , because he would never do such a thing to his kids - and they can't be such good actors ( if they knew ) But then again the 9282 thing is really amazing !
It is important to know that the Pepsi incident is one of the most significant effects in PR History - and 9282 days later he " died " - is this really a coincidence ?
Or the biggest PR move in the Music business .
Thanks ! "

Girl Seen Buying CD for Michael
hi , I 'm Demetris .
earlier today , i was in kings gates shopping center , in ************. i was looking for cd's in hmv , when a girl caught my attention .
she looked about 14 , had black hair , a grey hoodie , jeans and a white with a number on , i cant remember .
she was looking around , before picking up mj's new cd , and slowly walking over to the counter .
she paid for the cd , and started walking out of the store .
i decided to follow her because she looked like she was up to trouble .
as she walked she would occasionally look around , asif to look to see if anyone was watching her .
she walked into the car park , into a secluded bit , and walked over to a black car .
the windows were blacked out , but not too much , so i could see through .
there was a man sat there wearing what i thought was a scarf covering most his face , and a hat .
he was sat in the back .
she knocked on the window , and the man wound it down , she said ' do n't worry , its me , ive got it ' the man opened the door , and i caught a glimpse of his face , the bit that was n't covered in the scarf .
i swore i knew that face from somewhere before .
they stayed in the car for about 10 minutes , before the girl came out .
she said ' bye mike , will you come back soon ? ' he did n't reply .
i then realised who it was .
michael jackson .
i was completely shocked .
i write to you , hoping you will believe me .
goodbye , i hope to hear from you soon .

ALIVE Is Written on Michael 's Lips
Michael Jackson
Fans around the world have been amazed about all the clues found on the cover of ' Michael ' the new CD , Nothing is more shocking than the word ALIVE spelled out on his lips .
We are asking that someone send in a detailed blow up .
The letters are definitely there , but you need a High Definition blow up to see it properly .
For a slightly better page you can check the video page .
Another Musician Comes Forward
On Dec 29,2010 we received an email from a true fan on Michael Jackson claiming she had been in contact with one of Michael 's key musicians who said without a doubt that he had faked his death and would make a comeback at some point , maybe January .
Until we can confirm this information with certainty , we must leave out the actual names .
If this information checks out it is perhaps the strongest evidence ever that we will see Michael perform again .
" Hello my name is D******** and I am a SUPER Michael Jackson Fan and I would not lie about anything that has to do with MJ .
I never really saw him in person , but as you all know on the movie This Is It ( XXXX .
the musician who plays in Michael Jackson 's band ) .
Well XXXX is always talking about Michael Jackson so I asked XXXX if it was true that Michael faked is death and that his children know .
XXXX said " yes it 's true , but it kinda makes me mad " .
I asked XXXX if he was going to come back and XXXX said " mabey in january from what he 's told me " but XXXX was n't sure .
So I tryed asking XXXX how he was going to come back , but XXXX would n't answer .
So I 'm guessing it 's a surprise .
I Promise you this is all true some might not beleive me and I do n't blame them because I would n't even myself .
Trust me Michael is alive and here forever .

Hidden Message Found In " This Is It "
D********* went on to tell us about the BACKWARD MASKING on ' This Is It ' .
BACKWARD MASKING is a technique that was popularized in the sixties when Rock Artists would insert secret backward messages in their music .
There were many backwards parts in the Beatles music .
Some artists went on to perfect the art by finding words that would say something both forwards and backwards .
It became a heated issue at one point when a Heavy Metal Band was taken to court and charged with a teenager 's suicide because of backward , subliminal messages in their music .
We know Michael Jackson had a love for Illusion .
He was a master of Illusion .
So it would not be surprising if he inserted Backward Masking into his recordings .
Especially if he was trying to send an encoded message to his fans .
Well someone had taken the entire ' This Is It ' track and ren it backwards and the result is HAIR RAISING .
Word fter word is heard clearly .
The message is clear .
It is total genius .

Producer of new Michael Jackson CD thinks
Michael is ALIVE and IN HIDING
According to website " thatgrapejuice.net " in London , Teddy Riley , who produced the album “ Michael , ” has come out and said what many have been thinking , believing and talking about since the media announced that Michael had died .
Riley ' stated quite simply that he thinks Michael Jackson is still alive .
He knows many people will think he 's crazy , but according to the information that he has access to he claims that Michael Jackson is , " in hiding " because he was a target ... for people , the media ...
Everybody , except his children and his surrogate family . "
He goes on to claim that
“ It was hard working on this album with him not being here , and not being able to , you know , really take this album to the level that it ’s supposed to go to … ” .
Riley feels that Michael is , " Smiling down " upon the project .
Riley is the one of the producers that worked with Michael a lot over the years .
He did the “ Dangerous ” album in 1991 , and recalls working on the new album was “ very emotional . ”
He goes on to say that he tried to bring Jackson ’s spirit into the studio by putting up pictures Michael , and would go back to recordings they did together like “ Jam ” and “ Dangerous ” to see if he thought Michael would be pleased .
Riley insists that all the lead vocals are Michael Jackson .
He goes on to say that much of the controversy is because the Jackson Family was not really a part of the project and " for his surrogate family [ the Cascios ] to be a strong part of the project , that ’s a problem to them . ”
Some family members had also been asking “ how much publishing do we have on this . ”
Riley says he has n’t even begun talking about his own publishing rights .
While he says talks may come to that , he also notes that if it does n’t happen , “ it does n’t matter , because I came on it [ the project ] for my friend [ Michael Jackson ] . ”
Riley also recently put up a blog site , ' teddyrileyblog.wordpress.com ' , opening it with a message to Michael Jackson written on Dec. 12 .
Talking directly to Michal with his full name of Michael Joseph Jackson , he called Michael a “ friend , mentor , big brother & musical partner , ” He then makes this dramatic statement :
“ Your wishes have been made .
I ’ve done your first command .
I am here as your servant … "
IS MICHAEL JACKSON ALIVE ???
Look at what Celebrities are saying about the
New Michael Jackson Music
Producer Teddy Riley has tweeted that he thinks Michael faked his death and will return at some point .
Riley was a collaborator on many Michael Jackson hits and produced " Breaking News " from the new album .
When a fan tweeted back about Akon 's thoughts on Michael being in hiding , Riley responded that he and Akon " think alike " .
Akon , who produced " Hold My Hand " from the new CD , Michael , is threatening to burn the tapes saying Michael 's incomplete work should not be released .
We must ask ourselves just what is going on .
It appears that things are really heating up here .
What if , perhaps ...
THE POST DISAPPEARANCE MICHAEL JACKSON MONEY MACHINE is somehow offending the King of Pop himself .
If anything would drive Michael out of hiding , we believe it would be the release of tracks he felt were inferior .
Top Christmas Charts
The public CAN NOT GET ENOUGH OF MICHAEL JACKSON !!!!
The longer he is out of the spotlight , the more people want him back .
The new Michael Jackson CD , called simply , " Michael " is expected to be the top selling CD this Christmas Season .
Another blockbuster package is also being released called , " Vision " featuring 42 Michael Jackson Videos , along with behind the scenes action .
It is a beautiful package and a perfect present for any true Jackson fan .
If these were n't enough , Nintendo is releasing the new Michael Jackson Video Game , " Experience " for Wii , This game allows players to learn some of Michaels patented dance steps .
If all this was n't enough , cirque du soleil has started selling tickets to the Immortal World Tour which starts in Montreal in October 2011 .
There is much speculation that if Michael has been hiding out this would be the perfect opportunity to re-emerge in a new and wonderful light .
Could This Be Michael Jackson ?
Hello , I was searching through the web when i came across a video .
At first I thought it was a fake ..... but then i looked at the hands and I knew that michael always wore a red wrist band and the person inthis video is wearing the exact same one !!
I think it 's him .
email received from P.C. New Video Game Teaches You to Dance Like Michael
but .......
IS IT REALLY MICHAEL SINGING ?
" Breaking News " is Full of Clues
We all know that Monday at midnight a new song was released by MJ called “ Breaking News ” .
Have you listened to the lyrics of this song .
In the song Michael is angry with the media because they wo n’t leave him alone .
He talks about the public ’s fascination with him in the media .
He talks something about an obituary things about MJ ?
Now is n’t that strange considering his estate claims that this song was written in 2007 .
The contents of this song is current ( meaning it describes MJ now for example mention of the obituary ) .
In “ Breaking News ” Michael also mentions something about an adventure ?
Remember at the close of a rehearsal Michael said this is an Adventure ?
“ Breaking News ” I feel has a lot of clues .
Do you wonder why Michael ’s mom is saying that , the person sing the song is not Michael ?
It sounds like Michael to me , but a lot of people do n’t like what “ Breaking News ” is saying .
Michael ’s mom may be trying to appeased the media by saying that it is not Michael singing “ Breaking News ” .
I think it is Michael and that song I feel is full of clues .
What do you think ?
Do you think Michael is singing “ Breaking News ” ?
Did you hear any of the clues in “ Breaking News ” ?
For the non believers that Michael is still alive they do n’t understand the song and this is why many people feel that it is not Michael .
I ’m not sure why his mom is saying that Michael ’s not singing “ Breaking News ” ?
I would love to hear your thoughts about what I think about “ Breaking News ” .
Do you agree or disagree ?
Thank you very much and I love your sight .

I see clues in " Breaking News " which I will elaborate with more detail .
In the first verse of " Breaking News " Michael I think gives reasons why he went into hiding .
The first verse is : " Everybody wanting Michael Jackson , Reporters stalking the moves of Michael Jackson .
So , that verse to me are some of the clues to why Michael went into hiding .
He 's saying everybody wanting Michael Jackson and everybody includes " fans , enemies , papparazzi , reporters , and more .
He was tired of reporters following his every move ( almost like stalking ) .
But the most important clue is the second verse that states : " Just when you thought he ( Michael ) was done , he comes to give it again !!!!
This verse to me TALKS ABOUT MICHAEL'S COME BACK !!!!!
Are you excited YET !!
When Michael says in the second verse " Just when you thought he was done ( done meaning dead ) , he ( Michael ) comes to give it AGAIN !!!!
( meaning that he will come out of hiding to perform and Direct , and be better than before .
Another , very important clue in " Breaking News " to show that this version is relating to Michael today and not 2007 when the original was supposed to have been recorded , is this verse in the beginning of " Braking News " : I went around the world today , He wants to write my obituary ???
Now it is possible that this part pertaining to the obituary was recorded in 2007 , but I do nt't think so .
Because , when I first heard " Breaking News " I wanted to see the lyrics because I wanted to make sure that I heard right when he said " he wants to write my obituary " .
But the strange thing was that every site that I went to , to see the lyrics for " Breaking News " the lyrics did not include the part about the obituary .
I knew I clearly heard Michael say " I went around the world today , he wants to write my obituary " .
Now this part and clue is very important , READY .
Being confused that all of the sights that I clicked on for " Breaking News " lyrics did n't have the obituary
part I went to the official Michael Jackson web sight and " Breaking News " lyrics was on the sight and guess what ?
The lyrics on the Official Michael Jackson web sight did include the part about the obituary , AND IT IS ON THE SONG !!!
Michael Jackson 's
Official web sight is the only sight that I clicked on that had the obituary verse in the lyrics .
That fact is very POWERFUL to me .
I agree with Teddy Riley and Akon that possibly Michael is not happy that some of his incomplete songs are being releashed , and that he may possibly be thinking of coming out of hiding sometime soon ( maybe within the year of 2011 ) , and when he does it will definitely be " Breaking News " !!!
L.O.V.E. Kimberly , I love you Michael !

Mom is Revealing Everything on Oprah
Katherine Jackson along with children Prince , Paris and Blanket – will be interviewed on The Oprah Winfrey Show Monday , November 8 .
There is speculation that she will make shocking revelations about the life of her son , Michael Jackson .
Randy Jackson is furious about the Oprah taping .
He said his " stomach ached " when he learned about the interview .
He went on to say that when the jury was deliberating his brother 's fate on child molestation charges in 2005 , Winfrey did a show on paedophilia .
Randy twittered , " I know that he would not have wanted this . "
" In fact , she is the last person on earth he would want around his children .
" I know there are a lot of you out there upset and angry over this .
I do n’t blame you .
Lisa Marie says he feared for his life
Lisa Marie Presly is finally speaking about Michael Jackson 's disappearance .
The last time they spoke Michael asked here if she still loved him .
" I told him I was indifferent , " says Lisa .
" He did n't like that word .
He cried . "
Then he dropped the bombshell
" Someone was going to try to kill him to get a hold of his catalog and his estate . "
Is This A Recent Picture of Michael ?
We have reported Michael telling many friends this in the year before he vanished .
What does one do when people are trying to kill them ?
Tell the police ?
Arm themselves ?
Or if you are a master of disguise , you fake your death and go into hiding .
Many sightings have been reported recently , we have not published them for obvious reasons .
" Please do not disclose my name or the whereabouts of this e-mail .
I 've attached a photo that I took of Michael secretly using my mobile phone .
I was sitting about 10 feet from him , he was aware that I was in the room but did n't know I was taking the photo .
This is highly confidential .
Do not disclose my personal info and please do not reply to this e-mail .
Michael is well but is taking it easy .
He does not plan on making a come back .
I really want to tell you more but I have said too much "

I have a question about all these Michael Jackson pictures .
I would do anything to know that Michael was alive but if he faked his death because he was afraid for his life then why would he let people even see him for one moment or does he really think he pulled it off ?
With all the Michael Jackson sightings can you tell most of them are fake .
it 's just not him .
This last one however really looks like him .
And what about his kids .
Prince had a facebook and it was real because facebook sent out an e-mail telling everyone to stop asking if he was really him .
All of a sudden though before x-mas after Michael 's death ?
Prince said that he was going to take a break from facebook but he would be back .
He never came back and also you were seeing the children out and about and now you do n't see or hear one word about them .
I know that Michael would die for his kids so where are they ?
he also would never go away and not see them .
That would kill him .
right ?
So when are we ever going to know .
If he is n't doing a come back then will we have to wonder forever .
That 's not fair , but Michael Jackson would be in a lot of trouble do n't you think if he all of a sudden reappeared .
His brother said when he was taken to the airport then corrected himself and said hospital .
Did he really just make a mistake or was he lying .
Why would Latoya go to view his body at forest lawn if he was n't there or was it to play up to the whole Michael Jackson fake death ?
Sorry for writing so much but I sit here for hours and read everything and it does n't make sense .
Why would Michael sing with Paul Anka at his concert the this is it song ?
Not if he 's far away .
The more people that know his is alive ?
actually makes it worse for him and his family .
What do you guys think ?
How many people are in on this if Michael is alive ?
it seems just too many for a fake death .
too dangerous .
The day he died was ridiculous .
Why did n't they say it was unless either he was already dead or had left the house with the so called doctor .
What if he is charged and goes to jail .
I have n't heard anything about either have you ?

IS MICHAEL JACKSON ALIVE ???
and living in Ireland ?
Something very strange seems to be happening in Ireland .
We have received several e-mails from people claiming to have seen Michael Jackson in Ireland .
The most shocking came from Sharon who has been communicating with us on a regular basis since Michael 's disappearance last year .
Sharon revealed " her " real name and sent these pictures
" Sharon " claims that Michael Jackson is staying in Cork under an assumed name with the initials A.H .
Is This Michael in Ireland ?
The first picture was taken of Michael fleeing the US and the second is his possible new home in Ireland .
Why Ireland ?
Something we reported almost a year ago has recently shown up in the major news services .
Michael Loves Ireland .
He would often escape there to get away from the media maddness elsewhere .
Jackson told reporters : “ Ireland has inspired me to make a great album .
I have never given up on making music . ”
Michael often stayed at the Grouse Lodge or he would relax in Co Wicklow .
He he paid € 30,000 per week to stay at Luggala Castle for three months .
Michael often said he wanted to move to Ireland permanently , and that he even spent time house - hunting in Co Cork .
Psychic Randa Starr , claims that Michael 's fascination with Ireland stems from his interest in fairies and leprechauns .
There were even rumours that Michael had plans to build an Irish - themed leprechaun theme park .
In March this year , many of Jackson 's personal items were auctioned off in Co Kildare .
Want more MIchael in Ireland Info ?
We 've all seen the horrible " final " picture
of Michael in the ambulance
But have you seen how it was made ?
You take the ambulance picture on the left and insert Michael Jackson 's face
in a recent e-mail Sharon P. alerted us the the fact that there was HARD EVIDENCE that the ambulance photo was faked .
We have posted several videos on the VIDEO page that explain this process in detail .
THIS IS IT !
It 's been ten years since Michael 's disappearance and we are expecting a sign
Everything is pointing to these days , this time .
Now .
We are asking all Michael Jackson Fans from around the world to look diligantly for signs .
If Michael is alive , we feel this anniversary is when he will make his presence known .
It could be a message on Twitter or a sighing in Stockholm .
No one knows .
Please report anything you see or hear that could be a Sign and we will post it immediately .
God Bless you Michael , wherever you are .
" i am alive and here forever "
This is by far the most shocking Michael Jackson Sighting we have received yet .
We were very hesitant to post it .
We can not come to any firm conclusion about its authenticity but for some reason it seems to ring true .
We have reprinted the full original email and subsequent correspondence on the EYEWITNESS PAGE .
We want to know what you think .
Is it possible .
Is Michael Alive ?
and then there 's this .....
According to Bang Media new recordings have emerged that prove Michael Jackson feared for his life and went into hiding .
Tapes of leaked answering machine messages have revealed that Michael begged friends for money to help him start a new life as he feared for his safety .
In one message , published by The Sun newspaper , he said : " It is Michael calling .
It is very important , I want that 150 in that account for me , because ...
I am very concerned about my life .
I am hearing a lot of stories that ( name withheld ) is still trying to sabotage ( inaudible ) me and I want to be in a different environment and , um , I 've found a place that I like and now ( inaudible ) I want to be away for a while where they can't find me .
So please help me , help ( inaudible ) help me , and , um , more important than ( inaudible ) .
We are brothers . "
Other messages reveal the " embarrassed " singer was trying to flee the " Italian Mafia " and make more requests for cash , using the code word " sun screen " for money .
In many messages he sounds frantic and paranoid , while in others his voice is slurred and he appears dazed and confused .
Daphne said : " Some of Michael 's closest confidents talked to me exclusively about his addictions - and provided audio tapes of Michael never heard before .
Airport Shutdown for 2 hours
after MJ's " Death "
Michael Jackson spotted in Stockholm
In an email we received LAX ( Los Angeles airport ) was shutdown for 2 hours on 25th June after Michael Jackson ’s sudden death .
A mysterious private jet departed from the airport during this time .
The staff on the airport had been told to ignore the plane .
This is interesting , since Jermaine Jackson made a little slip - up during a radio - interview not too long ago .
He said that “ Michael was not with us way before he arrived to the airport . ”
The woman who interviews Jermaine gives him a strange look , and Jermaine quickly says he meant “ the hospital ” .
Airport … Hospital .

i was eating in a cafe around midday , in a fairly quiet street .
and then suddenly walking down the road came michael jackson !!
and i'm seriously not joking , it was definatly him , he had his head down but he looked up for second and looked right at me , his face was unmistakable .
he was walking between two more men , both quite tall and burly .
i got the shock of my life and got my camera out ( to get some evidence ) but the damn thing had run out of battory !!
i was so annoyed , i ran out to try and get another glimpse of michael but he had dissapeared round the corner with the two men .
by the time i had gone round the corner , they had got into a black car and driven off .
of course , i was devasted not to have talked to him , but i hvant told anyone except my close family ( who dont believ me sadly ) as he obviously has reasons for keeping hidden .
i just wanted to share my amazign story with others liek me , who believ he still is alive ,
thankyou ,

seriously , this is not a joke , i really think ive just seen michael jackson , alive !!
im shakign so hard , it was such a shock !
i found your site a while ago , and thought some of it was interesting .
beign a lifelong fan of MJ , i was obviously devastated when i heard the news about him , i just presumed he was dead .
but all your evidence and photos had made me suspicious , and now i know the truth !!
MJHOAXEVIDENCE has posted a video on YouTube with some of the most incredible evidence we have seen .
He posted screenshots of what he claims to be the official Jackson Twitter account with tweets about Michael coming back in June !!!!!!
Oddly ,
The June come - back is also mentioned in one of the sightings reported below from Michael 's personal psychic .

The story just keeps getting deeper and stranger .
Now Dr. Murray is claiming that Michael Jackson killed himself .
He says that he gave Michael a little Propofol to help him sleep but when he left the room Michael injected himself with a fatal dose .
WHAT IS UP HERE ?
I hope someone else smells a rat , something is wrong with all this ,
It appears that someone died , but was it really Michael ??
If Michael Jackson is dead why do people keep seeing him
in England ?
ALEXANDER VERIFIES UK SIGHTING
I w as excited to come across your web site earlier , having searched the Internet in desperation after believing that I had sighted Michael Jackson in the town of Wisbech in Cambridgeshire , England .
The question that immediately sprang to mind was " why on earth , if Michael Jackson is indeed alive , would he be found in the east of England ? " .
The answer to this question hit me very suddenly ...
The man was dressed fully in black , with a thin wiry build and fragile gait , he wore a fedora style hat and tinted glasses with a mask covering his nose and mouth .
My breath was taken by his very presence , his pale white skin seemed almost ghostly from behind the dark vale of his vampirical fringe .
Everything about him said
this is Michael Jackson ; but something else said to me ' this is n't ' .
He still had the walk , the presence , the style that won all of our hearts but he looked tired of it all .
I only caught his eyes for a few moments before he was whisked into a limousine by a burly bodyguard - type person ; I realised the reason he is here is because he's had enough of the jet set life .
Perhaps Michael Jackson has simply retired , the boy that never grew up has indeed grown up and now wants to retire to a sleepy Georgian Village in England .
Michael Jackson seen in UK
P. S. as a side note , I heard from a shop owner in the centre of town who insists Name
Email
he served Michael Jackson and that he used the name Joe Willis , others that I have spoken to insist that he has assumed a number of names including Alexander O - Hennesy and Andrew Hill .
email recieved from RJO
After reading rich - i mean RJO 's story , i was incredibly surprised to find my name in his account !
Maybe it was local myth , or i'm just incredibly popular , but it was rather strange hearing the alternative names he goes by !
I have however spoken to a local adult shop owner who claims to have served Michael Jackson .
I have seen someone who looks like him and hoped it was , and
i know of people who have seen Michael Jackson .
He was pretty much as RJO described , and i have seen a black limo and a silver mercedes around the shops i usually visit , which was n't there before .
I agree with RJO 's view that Michael may be hiding in Wisbech , as it would be a get away from all the limelight .
Faking his own death would be a good way to escape the publicity and hassle all us loving fans gave him , but we mus n't blame ourselves .
I hope this is true , and that he is still alive and safe in a palce he can now enjoy .

Michael Seen Again in England !!!
Last weekend on the fifth of March I had gone out with my friends around King 's Lynn , Norfolk , England .
Getting bored of the proceedings I had decided to leave early , around eleven p.m .
Walking through the streets alone and only slightly drunk I stumbled across a heap of dark clothes upon the floor , thinking nothing of it I carried on until I heard a voice in the darkness ; " Hey there , are you alright to be walking alone ? "
It was a soft voice , with an American lilt and I froze suddenly - it sounded familiar but I just could n't place it .
I turned and saw a ghostly presence before me , he had this soothing aura and I felt immediate peace .
" I 'm fine , " I tried to say , but I heard the words slurring out of my mouth .
" Let me walk with you . "
This man , small and weak walked me until I was almost at my door , never speaking a word more .
I was burning to ask him if he was who I thought he was , KNEW he was .
I know this great , great man had chosen to retire to Norfolk , England and I have heard rumours he is actually staying in Wisbech , a town close to Lynn .
I often think of that night , and what could have happened .
Thank you Michael for walking me home ,
for being the great artist you are , and for choosing to live in England .
If we ever meet again , I would be happy to return your watch .

" On October 6 , 2009 I shared with you my experience that happened on September 30 , 2009 when I saw Michael Jackson at the Miami Airport .
That day has replayed in my mind everyday since it happened .
I know who I saw I 'm not crazy .
And I know that other people there saw him as well .
I was at that Airport again recently when I came back home on a weekend leave from my stationed base in Virginia .
Being a fan all my life I got this feeling that I cannot explain when I looked at him in the middle of the crowd .
That walk was so characteristic of Michael .
It was him I know it .
My family thinks I just can't let go .
I really do n't care what anybody thinks .
I hold a job in the U.S Air Force I have absolutely nothing to gain from making any of this up .
But as I said I know who I saw .
Michael Jackson is alive . " e-mail recieved from Marie 1/29/2010
Here 's her original sighting .........
I saw Michael Jackson in the Miami Airport
I 've looked for some place where I can tell what I saw .
I 'm in the U.S Air Force .
I was on leave back home in Miami , Fl . On Sept 30 I was in the Miami Airport getting ready to fly back to Langley Air Force Base in Hampton , Virginia where I 'm stationed .
I was standing around replying to a text message .
When this group on men came storming through .
I did n't know what was going on I started running towards them and I could see a man in the middle of the crowd with a white fedora , a black satin surgical mask Michael Jackson .
People were yelling Michael .
And I started yelling Michael , Michael as well .
I heard some lady say Oh My God he is alive .
They were darting through they went outside .
I had tears in my eyes because I knew it was him .
I 'm a huge fan and I would never make this up and give false hope to anyone .
Please believe me I saw Michal alive

. 35 people saw
Michael Jackson at the Miami Airport !!!!
According to Your World Report , 35 eyewitness 's spotted Michael Jackson running through the Miami International Airport on September 30 .
The article goes on to speculate .
" “ Is he alive ?
Is he dead ?
Is he dead but back on earth as an angel ? "
The article further states that the man they thought was Jackson “ was wearing a black satin surgical mask and white fedora . ”
He was surrounded by an entourage of , “ about 25 very tough - looking men , all in dark suits and wearing sunglasses with Michael in the middle .
“ They were coming through the airport and moving fast – at first I thought President Obama must be in town .
But then I saw Michael and I was n’t the only one .
“ I know it was him .
About 20 of us all seemed to shout at once , “ Michael Jackson !
Michael Jackson !
It ’s him !
He ’s alive !’ before the men who were with him pushed him into a black limo and raced out of there . ’
“ I was shaking so hard I could n’t think straight .
About 30 to 35 people gathered around and everybody was saying , “ It was him .
I know it was .
“ “ Then airport security officers came from every direction and they threatened to call the police if we did n’t move on .
We told them Michael Jackson had been there and they looked at us like we were crazy .
But I ’m not crazy .
I know what I saw .
Michael Jackson is alive . ”

" hello my father makes shoes in a mall in denmark one day i was in for lunch and talked with my dad
suddenly Michael Jackson walked up and asked my dad to make his shoes because they where to rough on the bottom so he couldnt moonwalk .. i started to cry and asked are you really michael jackson .
he looked at me and said of course i am .
i asked him why he made the hole world believe he was dead .
tears filled his eyes and he said i just needed a break i needed to get help for my drug problem .
i'm so sad i hurt my fans around the world and i will come back and do my world tour .
i just needed a break .
I hugged him and he asked do you think the fans will forgive me i told him of course we will our love for you are uncondiotionely .
i said i love you and he said i love you more . " e-mail received 2/4/10 from Line
He gave the Zip code which I can't recall , but I noticed the letter was addressed somewhere in Indianapolis , USA .
This whole incident caused such a scene as we do n't see things like this often in our neck of the woods .
A little crowd of people gathered round and someone went to take a photo with their cellphone .
One of three security men took the phone and practically tore it in half , giving the guy a small handful of British currency .
This caused more excitement , and more people gathered around from outside the shop .
Another security man appeared and they ushered the ' stranger ' out of the shop towards the car .
As he passed me ,
I going into the post office which is inside the Costcutters shop , in Layt on , Blackpool , UK .
A big limo pulled up ( black with dark windows ) and a big burly security looking guy got out and went in before me .
He was at the counter in front of me and he spoke with an American / South African accent .
He was trying to mail a letter to the USA .
The counter lady asked for the zip code to add ( it was a recorded delivery letter ) and the guy did n't know .
So he was on his cellphone asking someone about it .
Within a minute or so , a guy the build of MJ came in with another security looking guy .
The stranger was wearing a big black fedora type hat , dark sunglasses and a lit tle black mask over his mouth and nose .
I looked straight into his eyes
and I absolutely knew , it was Michael Jackson .
obsessive .
I am a respectable , middle aged guy who although I love his music and have had it in my life since I was a kid myself , I 'm not a fanatic for MJ .
I run a small business and was in the army Royal Military Police for 12 years , so observation is a good skill I developed .
Why would he be here in Blackpool UK ?
the simple answer is why not ?
There is a large award winning zoo and animal centre here which is small enough not to attract too big a crowd , yet large enough to be on your own and not be too obvious to people .
Just athought .

After this experience ,
I know 100 % in myself that MJ is still alive
and that it was him .
I can't expalin totally why , some things you just know from instinct and a special place inside you .
I feel almost stupid , because the first thing I could think of saying was " You are not alone " and the ' stranger ' leaned towards my ear and whispered " I am here with you " quick as a flash .
I know inside me without doubt , this was Michael Jackson .
Someone behind me said " He looks like Michael Jackson " at which the stranger was ushered faster into the car and they drove off quite fast .
To explain , I am not an MJ Want your Lover Back ?
first look at his fingers nose and lips if you look at the other picture youll see that his fingers are hard and wrinkly and tan colored also the nose is not as pointy and lips are pinker or redder than his usual style i hope this helps ps:look at the THIS IS IT announcer mj and look at his hair its very CLEARLY a wig .
" I talk to him everyday "
says Michael Jackson 's longtime friend Cassandra Gretchen - Sims in an interview with Your World Report tabloid .
“ ‘ Tell them I had to do it .
I had no choice .
If I had tried to do the London shows we had scheduled , I would have died for real .
I thank God for helping me see the light .
I will see you all next June on my world tour – the greatest tour the world has ever seen , bigger than Thriller , bigger than the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined . ’
“ He told me to ‘ tell everyone , tell all my fans ’ that the stories of his drug abuse and addiction ’ sadly , are true .
But I ’m not dead .
I ’m getting stronger and drugs are behind me .
I ’ll never take another drug , not even an aspirin .
Tell my fans I ’m sorry for putting them through so much sadness and turmoil .
“ He is monitoring the Internet and he really enjoys all the messages from his fans .
He said they ‘ give me strength and fill me with love .
Tell them that all the love they send to me I send right back .
I love my fans ! ’ ”

Ireland revealed as Michael 's Sanctuary
Michael Jackson 's older brother Jermaine has revealed that Ireland was always Michael 's place to escape the madness of his crazy life .
Jermaine told the press that he absolutely loved it there and spent much time in the castles .
He said Michael found it very green , beatiful and peaceful .
" I would like some way to disappear where people do n't see me anymore at some point , " ... " I do n't want to grow old .
I never want to look in the mirror and see that "
recently i read that michael was house hunting in Ireland and mainly in a hide away counties of wicklow and cork !
and supposedly he has been spotted in Dublin Airport with two men and a woman !
Michael has always had a fascination with Ireland and mythology !
the king is here !

Michael Jackson Healings ?
According to Meredith Moraven , a Swiss reporter there are reported Michael Jackson healings in Budapest , Prague and Rome .
“ I have spoken with two families of three who are claiming that Micheal ’s ‘ ghost ’ – or his ‘ angel ’ – appeared at the bedsides of their children late at night and healed them of cancers , as one parent describes it , ‘ With love and a touch . ’
“ I have confirmation in one instance from a doctor who says that he did n’t see Jackson but is willing to sign an affadavit saying that an 11 - year - old boy he did n’t expect to live more than a day or two is now recovering at home with no sign or symptom of the leukemia that was killing him , thanks , according to his mother , to Michael Jackson ’s angel appearing at his bedside . ’ from Your World Report
In 2000 - 2001 , Michael Jackson sat down with his close friend and spiritual guide , Rabbi Shmuley Boteach , to record what turned out to be the most intimate and revealing conversations of his life .
It was Michael -s wish to bare his soul and unburden himself to a public that he knew was deeply suspicious of him .
The resulting thirty hours are the basis of The Michael Jackson Tapes .
There has never been , and never will be , anything like them

NEW VIDEO GAME TEACHES YOU HOW TO DANCE LIKE MICHAEL I saw Michael in Norway I am sure I saw Michael – I live not far from where Omar Bhatti ’s family live ( Holmlia in Oslo , Norway ) and today when I drove past the railway station at Hauketo ( nor far away ) I saw a man who had to be Michael – he was waiting for the local train ( not sure which direction – to or from Holmlia ( together with two men who looked like bodyguards ) and he was wearing his usual hat and towel + a black jacket and pants .
The bodyguards stood very close to him , as to protect him from being spotted .
I opened my car window and shoutet “ Hi Michael ” and he quickly turned his head towards me and then hid his face .
I was too shocked to manage to take a picture with my cellphone – but I am positive this was Michael !!!!!

Michael Jackson At BET Awards ??
Video of final moments with MJ disappears -
The images that could reveal what happened on June 25 , mysteriously disappeared from the mansion of the star .
According to the National Enquirer , " authorities in the case said that the Jackson family mansion was equipped with a strong security system .
" There were cameras on the outside and also inside the residence , " revealed a police source .
But think about it .
Does n't it make sense that the King of Pop would fake his death at this point in his life ?
Being forced out of seculsion to pay off huge debts , Being " owned " by powerfull forces he needed to escape from , yes .....

Comic - Con is coming up , and how could you not be a little excited ?
Especially with Entertainment Weekly doing their Con preview , including these early Iron Man 2 teaser pics .
Marvel Movies on Facebook dug up these pictures which show not only Black Widow but also Whiplash and the return of Tony Stark .
The images are pretty blurry … we ’ll keep an eye out for high - quality versions .
I was going to make a joke about how attractive Scarlett Johannson is , but after the Whip It trailer and Natalie Portman news , maybe I should tone down the libido .
Even though she is super - duper sexy and hott and RED - HEADED and rawr .
Wow , that backfired .
Check out the images below .

UPDATE : Entertainment Weekly has posted a higher - rez preview photo of the EW cover .
The images have been updated accordingly .
UPDATE 2 : EW also posted a full body shot of the young lady , now included below .

Let 's imagine world oil supply suddenly drops by 10 , 20 or 30 percent , more or less overnight , for several weeks or months to come .
Do n't worry about how or why – we can all think of ways a sudden oil shortage could arise .
The more interesting questions are how we respond and what local impacts would follow .
At the international level there is sure to be argy - bargy among countries over who gets what from where and how much we pay .
It is hard to predict how these global issues may play out .
In the case of a serious shortage the ways we share the remaining oil supply and set global prices will be a matter of life or death for some countries , particularly the smaller and poorer ones , so let us hope the international community surprises us with fairness .
At the national level I expect most countries will have to do their best with 10 , 20 or 30 percent less oil all of a sudden .
What happens next ?
There 's no time for you and me to make plans so if we 're lucky we will find that our public servants have already done it for us , and heaven knows they 've had enough warnings since 1973 .
Here in Australia we have the Liquid Fuel Emergency
Act which comes with significant powers to override State responsibilities and impose emergency national control over fuel supply .
There have been planning sessions and desktop exercises held by our various Governments on how this legislation will work so we can assume that some thought has been given to allocation and rationing rules .
It would be helpful for the responsible bodies to take the next step and make their plans public to guide the thinking of businesses and local authorities .
Other countries may have similar arrangements in place , and if they do n't they can always refer to the IEA 's handy guide Saving Oil in a Hurry .
I expect the emergency rules will work quite well after the first week or two when everyone gets used to having less fuel available .
From my experience living through the oil crises of 1973 and 1980 we can look out for some truly dazzling exercises in special pleading from those who believe their own personal car use is more indispensable to the nation than anyone else 's .
Seriously though , how would you like to try withholding fuel from Meals on Wheels or other charities ?
And what about volunteer firefighters , school teachers , nurses , doctors , train drivers , priests or policemen ?
The list gets pretty long and we should feel sympathy for the administrators who have to take a stand and do the cutting .
Placing some facts on the table
At this point I would like to bring numbers into the discussion .
Australian authorities publish good data on national energy usage – enough for us to work out where the fuel is used today and what might have to happen if we run short .
The numbers are huge of course and could be expressed in millions of litres or barrels of oil .
I have chosen to present them in petajoules or PJ , a unit of energy which happens to be convenient for comparing oil with gas , coal and other fuels .
The units are not as important as the relative size of the numbers between different sectors of the economy .
Here 's the big picture and it's all about transport which is responsible for 72 % of Australia 's petroleum products consumption .
Australian liquid petroleum end -uses for 2006 - 07 , including LPG and biofuels
Source : Energy in Australia 2009 , Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics
Why does Agriculture use so much fuel ?
Think tractors and harvesters .
Why Mining then ?
Again the answer is mainly mobile equipment – Australian mines use large amounts of diesel for excavators , dump trucks and the like , which is why our diesel consumption has dropped a bit since a number of large mines went quiet last year due to the financial crisis .
Industry also uses a lot of diesel , especially in the Chemicals , Non-ferrous metals and Construction sectors .
Road transport uses 55 % of our liquid fuels and it's the sector that most directly affects each of us day to day .
Fortunately there are so many organisations involved in road use that a great deal of interesting data is available on fuel consumption and travel purposes .
Here is the breakdown of road transport fuel usage according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics ' annual Survey of Motor Vehicle Use , with litres converted to petajoules based on the respective energy contents of diesel , petrol and LPG .
Australian liquid petroleum road transport uses for 2006 - 07 including LPG and biofuels
In this we can begin to see the outline of a problem .
Look at that number for Passenger vehicles – in other words our cars .
To make any serious savings in fuel use that number has to come down a lot .
The petroleum fingerprint
We now have too many numbers in front of us for easy comprehension .
To integrate these tables of data we can use a graphical presentation called a Marimekko after the Finnish textiles design firm that inspired the concept .
What the Marimekko shows is a series of vertical slices whose horizontal width is proportional to the fuel used by each sector in petajoules .
The vertical dimension shows the share of each sector 's consumption between Personal , Commuting and Business use .
Area on the chart represents total volume usage .
Australian liquid petroleum products – end-uses for 2006 - 07 including LPG and biofuels ( petajoules )
Click for larger image
Personal or Leisure usage is shown white and makes up 26 % of the total .
Commuting ( driving to and from work ) is shown in a light colour and totals 11 % .
The remaining 63 % coloured in a dark shade is Business usage .
You could regard this diagram as the fingerprint of petroleum fuel consumption for a country .
I can say for certain that Australia 's fingerprint is distinctively different from other countries .
Without even doing the numbers I know that anywhere else will have very different shares for sectors like Buses , Air transport , Mining , Agriculture and Residential .
For example some cold regions in the northern hemisphere still use large amounts of heating oil for houses in winter .
On the other hand few other countries use as much fuel as Australia for mining .
In some countries the military would need a sector of its own .
Most low - income countries will use less air transport and more buses , trucks or rail .
Each change will shift the picture and alter the local opportunities for savings if oil runs short .
Note that Australia 's rail sector shows hardly any commuting use of petroleum products .
That 's because all of Australia 's significant commuter rail lines are electrified .
Surprising insights for me from the Marimekko include how much fuel air transport uses in Australia and how little buses use – only one tenth as much as air .
When you consider that one bus lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge carries more passengers per day ( in one direction ) than all seven car lanes in both directions you realise what an inefficient choice cars can be for moving large numbers of people .
So what ?
OK , I 've set the scene .
You can scan the Marimekko and see where our fuel goes today .
Now what might we expect to happen if Australia experiences an oil supply shortage ?
There are all sorts of technical estimates made in publications like Saving Oil in a Hurry but I prefer to look at the data and think about what is really likely to play out in a country that I know .
I expect that business lobby groups will be pretty good at presenting the case that their activities are essential to everyone 's well - being in today 's world and should continue regardless .
And I expect that most people like you and I will be pretty good at going along with emergency restrictions , as long as the rules are seen to be fair and affect everybody in the same way , and as long as food keeps turning up in the shops .
In the face of drought Australians have responded well to the water restrictions introduced over the last few years .
Water savings have been in the 15 - 25 % range , and I think it is reasonable to expect a similar spirit of positive personal response to emergency fuel restrictions .
My estimating guidelines for short - term emergency fuel savings are as follows :
Businesses will save only a little to start with though some mining , industrial and road transport operators can work out ways to reduce fuel use by 10 % or more if pushed on the matter
Light commercial vehicles – all those white vans and other tool - of - trade vehicles – will generally want to keep doing what they do and will provide smaller fuel savings than passenger cars
Public transport will use slightly more fuel off a low base and then reach a capacity limit at about 10 % increase
Air transport will try to keep the status quo going ( those businesses again ) but will quickly accept reality and reduce leisure flights
People are smart .
Most of us are adaptable and can soon learn to cut back on personal driving or share rides for commuting to make large savings .
Applying these guidelines to current fuel usage numbers leads to the two scenarios below , one for 10 % less fuel use and the other for 20 % less .
The 20 % scenario is confronting enough to put me off thinking about what 30 % might look like .
You may wish to try some different guidelines but I will be surprised if you can come up with an answer that does n't depend on a big cut in passenger vehicle usage .
Two petroleum supply shortfall scenarios
A startlingly simple rule of thumb emerges from this scenario analysis .
For Australia ;
A 5 % cut in fuel supply requires a 10 % drop in car usage
A 10 % cut in fuel supply requires a 20 % drop in car usage
A 20 % cut in fuel supply requires a 40 % drop in car usage
Just keep doubling the numbers until you run out of options .
The cruelty of averages
Something else to think about is what it actually takes to achieve an average 40 % drop in car usage .
An average implies that some people will have to do more because others will do less .
Once you factor in all the necessary exemptions for worthy causes like charities and public service occupations I suspect the rest of us will be facing cuts quite a bit deeper than 40 % if the nation is to save enough .
Perhaps that is why I remember startlingly empty roads , long petrol queues and a surge in motorcycle sales back in 1973 .
How would commuters cope ?
A sudden shortage means we need to manage with what we have .
Public transport is not a magic pudding that can just expand overnight to service extra demand .
Nobody keeps very many spare buses lying around just in case , and most peak - hour rail services are already close to capacity .
There is some useful capacity to be gained from time - shifting where a percentage of workers start their day an hour or two earlier or later than usual .
This spreads peak loads over a broader time period and increases the total numbers who can be carried by public transport each day .
However public transport is practically absent in country areas and does n't run to every place that people want to go in cities .
What other options are there besides staying home , walking or cycling ?
When you think about it our most under - utilised transport resource is all those cars driving round with one person in them .
If you can double average car occupancy from the typical 1.2 people to 2.4 you 've halved fuel usage instantly .
The logic of ride - sharing is compelling if there is enough pressure to force us into sharing the cosy private spaces we enjoy inside our cars .
Ride - sharing used to be common practice for commuters and was a rich source of humour about social interactions – anyone remember Dagwood cartoons ?
The western world has never had a fuel crisis in the age of iPhones and Twitter .
I expect that simple mobile - phone - based ride - sharing facilitation schemes will spread like a virus around cities and suburbs if the need emerges .
Some localities already have ride - share websites which link up passengers and drivers .
The software community is working on more sophisticated " Dynamic Ridesharing " tools which may come in useful one day .
So there are some predictable consequences of a sudden oil shortage .
Some of them might even be fun .
Let 's see when such an event happens .
I hope these thoughts encourage you to consider the local and personal angles and think about what you and your family would be able to do .
Good general advice is perhaps to buy a sturdy bicycle , get to know your neighbours better and ponder about how you can get around with much less fuel .

Lonesome George , the last remaining Galápagos giant tortoise , may soon be a father after years of efforts by scientists trying to get him to mate .
Ecuadorian officials are keeping their fingers crossed for Lonesome George , aged between 90 and 100 and described by the Guinness book of world records as the " rarest living creature " , after one of the two female tortoises kept with him laid five eggs .
George , said to be at his sexual peak , is the only known living Geochelone abigdoni tortoise .
His companions are of a similar but different species .
Scientists at the Galápagos national park have been trying for years to get George to avail himself of his female companions to ensure that his line does not peter out .
Lonesome George , weighing 90kg ( 14st 2lb ) was a native of Pinta , an isolated northern island of the Galápagos .
By the late 1960s , it was noted that the tortoise population on the rarely visited island had dwindled close to extinction .
George , discovered in 1972 , was immediately brought into captivity at the Charles Darwin research station on the island of Santa Cruz .
Scientists have been trying to get George to mate since 1993 , when they introduced two female tortoises of a different subspecies from the neighbouring island of Isabela into his pen , but he has been in no hurry to procreate .
George astounded conservationists last year by mating for the first time in the 36 years he has been in captivity .
But the eggs laid by one of his female companions turned out to be infertile .
The national park has said that the latest eggs , described as being in perfect condition , are being cared for in an incubation centre .
It will be November before scientists know whether they are viable .
" Now we have to wait for the incubation period of 120 days to find out whether they are fertile , " it has said ..
Tortoises on the Galápagos have been hunted for their meat by sailors and fishermen to the point of extinction .
Charles Darwin , when he arrived in the Galápagos in 1835 , described how he and the crew of the Beagle lived entirely on tortoise meat .
Also , the habitat of the tortoises has been eaten away by goats introduced from the mainland .

USA TODAY research WASHINGTON 
Taxing the rich may be popular with many Americans , but some experts warn that a proposed tax on the wealthy to pay for an overhaul of health care could be bad economic medicine .
House Democrats included a surtax on families making more than $ 350,000 in a sweeping health care bill unveiled Tuesday — the latest idea Congress is considering to pay for President Obama 's broad goal to provide coverage to the nation 's 50 million uninsured .
A majority of Americans , 58 % , supported increasing income taxes on the wealthy to pay for health care , a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll found this week , but some experts say a less popular but broader tax tied to health care spending could be more sustainable over time .
" You have a health plan that 's meant to benefit everybody ... but it 's being paid for by only 2.1 million taxpayers , " said Rosanne Altshuler , co-director of the non-partisan Tax Policy Center .
" It 's difficult to raise revenue this way . "
The House legislation comes as Obama is ramping up pressure on lawmakers to act quickly on health care , his top domestic priority .
The president is scheduled to make remarks about health care at the White House today .
Negotiations over separate versions of the legislation in the Senate and House have stalled in recent weeks as lawmakers sought ways to pay for the $ 1 - trillion - plus cost .
The most expensive provision : subsidies to help low - income people pay for premiums .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , said the bill will move quickly and reiterated that the House will vote on legislation before lawmakers return to their districts for the August recess .
" Inaction is not an option for us , " Pelosi said .
House Democrats said the tax would raise $ 544 billion over 10 years .
Under the House legislation , families earning between $ 350,000 and $ 500,000 would pay an additional 1 % in income tax .
The new tax would increase with higher salaries so that families earning more than $ 1 million would pay an additional 5.4 % .
The tax would apply to the top 1.2 % of households in the USA , according to a House Ways and Means Committee document .
A separate proposal to pay for health care by taxing some benefits offered by employers — currently exempt from federal taxes — lost steam this month in the Senate because Democratic lawmakers , including Sen .
Charles Schumer of New York , said it would have been too great a burden on middle - class families .
Joseph Thorndike , a historian with the Tax History Project , said broadening the tax base to more Americans — though it may be less politically popular — might be better policy .
In part , a broader tax could be less easy to repeal in the future .
" If you ask people to pay something then they have an ownership stake in it , " Thorndike said , citing Social Security as an example .
" The narrow , soak - the - rich approach is real short - sighted politics . "
Chuck Marr , director of federal tax policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , countered that high - income families have paid less in taxes over the past several years .
He said the Senate 's proposed tax on benefits and the House surtax on the wealthy are both realistic options .
" Given the income gains that those at the very top have enjoyed , and the tax cuts they have received over the last three decades , " Marr said , " a surtax on those same people is a natural option . "
Still , the idea has been criticized by some Democrats .
Sen. Ron Wyden , D - Ore. , said Tuesday that he has " not heard much support " from his colleagues .
Republicans in the House have been more blunt .
" The taxes are onerous during a recession , " said Rep. Dave Camp , R - Mich .
" They 're going to fall on families , small businesses , manufacturers — and they 're going to cost us millions of jobs . "

Not too long ago , I wrote about loading JavaScript without blocking by creating a dynamic < script > tag .
When < script > tags are in the flow of an HTML document , the browser must stop rendering and wait for the script file to download and execute before continuing ( example ) .
Creating a new < script > tag via JavaScript avoids this issue because it ’s out of the flow of the document , so the script file is downloaded and executed without waiting .
The result : dynamically loading JavaScript files allows your page to render faster and therefore improve perceived performance .
The best technique
Steve Souders has explored several different ways to load JavaScript without blocking both on his blog and in his books .
After thinking about it and experimenting , I ’ve come to the conclusion that there ’s just one best practice for loading JavaScript without blocking :
Create two JavaScript files .
The first contains just the code necessary to load JavaScript dynamically , the second contains everything else that ’s necessary for the initial level of interactivity on the page .
Include the first JavaScript file with a < script > tag at the bottom of the page , just inside the < / body > .
Create a second < script > tag that calls the function to load the second JavaScript file and contains any additional initialization code .
That ’s it !
There ’s really no need to do anything else .
The key takeaway is to have only two JavaScript and make the first one as small as possible .
For example , the first file may just contain this function :
function loadScript ( url , callback ) { var script = document.createElement (" script " ) script.type = " text / javascript " ; if ( script.readyState ) { //IE script.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { if ( script.readyState == " loaded " || script.readyState == " complete " ) { script.onreadystatechange = null ; callback ( ) ; } } ; } else { // Others script.onload = function ( ) { callback ( ) ; } ; } script.src = url ; document.getElementsByTagName( " head " ) [ 0].appendChild( script ) ; }
That ’s a tiny amount of code to get your bootstrapped so it will load incredibly fast ( especially when gzipped ) .
The actual code on your page ends up looking like this :
< script type =" text / javascript " src= " http://your.cdn.com/first.js "></script> < script type =" text / javascript " > loadScript ( " http://your.cdn.com/second.js " , function ( ) { //initialization code } ) ; </ script >
The key to this whole technique is to have just two JavaScript files , so the second one contains everything that ’s needed to initialize the page .
What if your page requires more than two files ?
Then you should be concatenating your files together either at build time ( using something like Sprockets ) or at run time ( using something like mod_concat or a combo handler ) .
There should never be a time when your page requires more than these two JavaScript files to properly initialize .
Each additional HTTP request has overhead , and then you ’ll need to worry about sequencing the downloads so code is executed in the correct order .
By having just two files , you eliminate a large point of concern over which file is downloaded and executed first as well as eliminating unnecessary HTTP requests .
Script placement
You ’ll note that I mentioned the best practice of placing this code towards the end of the page , just inside the closing < / body > tag .
This is advice that has been around for a while and I still recommend it , even when using this technique .
The reason is that you ’re guaranteed all of the DOM elements you may need are already present on the page .
Loading your scripts earlier could introduce timing issues where you would need to worry about using window .
onload or some other method to determine when the DOM is ready to be used .
By including this code at the bottom of the page , you are assured that the DOM is ready to be poked and you wo n’t need to delay initialization any further .
Inlining the first script
Several commenters correctly pointed out that this technique can be further optimized by moving the initial function inline instead of keeping it in an external file .
Generally , I like to keep JavaScript outside of the page code for maintainability purposes .
I also anticipated that the initial JavaScript code on the page will be larger than just this function for one reason or another .
If you can have some sort of automation around injecting this into your page as an inline script , I ’m all for it !
The key point is to make sure the script is small enough that it ’s runtime performance does n’t affect page loading .
YUI 3 has you covered
YUI 3 is designed around this very premise .
You can start by just loading the yui.js file and then use the built - in Loader component to dynamically load the rest of the YUI library .
For example :
< script src= " http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.0.0b1/build/yui/yui-min.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " > YUI ( ) .use ( " node " , function ( Y ) { //initialization code } ) ; </ script >
This code loads in the YUI “ seed ” file first , then creates a new instance of the YUI object and indicates that the “ node ” component is necessary .
Behind the scenes , YUI constructs a URL with all of the dependencies for “ node ” , dynamically loads it , then calls the callback function when complete .
The cool thing about the YUI 3 approach is that you do n’t need to worry about including the URL for the JavaScript statically , just indicate which components you need and the library figures out the correct URL to download ( details ) .
Conclusion
Though there ’s been a lot of research on ways to load JavaScript without blocking , there really is just one way that I ’d recommend as a best practice .
There should really be no need to load anything more than two scripts to get your site initialize and interactive .
Make the initial JavaScript file as small as possible and then load in the larger one dynamically to avoid blocking .
This is the simplest , easiest way to get all of your JavaScript onto the page without affecting the user experience .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The next bubble in the recession is about to burst .
More than 650,000 Americans will have used up all of their unemployment benefits by September , in what experts say could be the start of a looming crisis .
In the early days of the downturn , the government extended unemployment benefits beyond the standard 26 weeks to as many as 79 weeks in hopes of giving the jobless a longer lifeline .
Officials predicted the economy worsening and businesses further contracting , resulting in fewer jobs for the newly unemployed to find .
With the recession now 18 months deep and the national unemployment rate standing at 9.5 % , it appears that the effort was n't robust enough for those in the crisis ' first wave of layoffs .
" We need to get the issue attention now , because people are running out of benefits and there 's just nothing for them , " said Andrew Stettner , deputy director of the National Employment Law Project , an advocacy group that has calculated the number of people who will exhaust their unemployment benefits .
In fact , Stettner and the Labor Department are expecting the problem to accelerate .
In the next few weeks , the victims of the mass layoffs that happened six months ago -- when the pace of layoffs was at its zenith -- will start running out of their basic benefits .
A total of 4.4 million people are expected to face this fate -- or 65 % of the entire filing population .
And while they may have up to another year of unemployment insurance benefits -- thanks to the confusing patchwork of extensions that were enacted last summer -- they will be soon be unaccounted for in government unemployment reports .
The Labor Department does n't track anyone who has moved beyond 26 weeks of unemployment in its weekly data on continuing claims ( the number of people who request benefits after their first week ) .
And , said Stella Cromartie , spokeswoman for the Bureau of Labor Statistics , said the agency does not currently have plans to begin tracking this population .
As a result , by late summer the government may begin reporting significant declines in continuing filers .
But it wo n't be cause for celebration .
Instead of of indicating that the economy is on the rebound , it could mean that more people are falling off the radar .
" We will see a decline in continuing filers , " said the NELP 's Stettner .
" People are falling out of these numbers , and the pace of more recent layoffs replacing them is not as steep . "
" They 're not included in these unemployment numbers we hear about every week , " said the NELP 's Stettner .
" They 're desperate , asking , ' What 's going to happen to me ? ' "
That 's the question facing Jay Ridinger , 54 , of Baxter , Tenn .
The self - proclaimed " road warrior " once worked for a contract management company , happily bouncing from city to city to complete federal projects .
Ridinger was accustomed to the stop - start schedule of a contractor , so he was n't worried when his last stint ended in August .
But he soon realized this stretch of unemployment was different : " I thought it was the status quo , and instead here I am , applying for food stamps .
I just sat in the office and cried and cried . "
When he was first laid off , Ridinger received the maximum $ 250 unemployment check per week -- at the time , Tennessee 's standard benefits lasted 13 weeks .
Revisions of laws allowed him to get additional weeks of benefits .
" Every time you run out of benefits , you think , ' What the heck am I gonna do ? ' "
Ridinger said .
" And then a month later , maybe a check will be in your mailbox -- maybe not .
Even if you get one , it 's like , ' Ain't that nice , after all that emotion ? ' "
In most states , the unemployed receive a maximum 26 weeks of state - funded benefits .
Two extension programs may also be available for an extra 53 weeks of benefits .
( Click here for further detail on unemployment benefits programs . )
The availability and duration of the programs depends on the state 's unemployment rates and whether it agreed to participate in part or all of the federal programs .
( View the map to see how many weeks of benefits your state offers . )
These extension programs are " difficult to understand , unprecedented and tough to administer , " noted Heidi Shierholz , an economist at the Economic Policy Institute , a nonprofit think tank .
" It surprised me how difficult it is to get data on this .
I study labor markets all the time , and even I did n't know just how much of a behemoth it is . "
But just because filers may not be counted in the weekly jobless claims data , it does not mean they do n't impact the national unemployment rate .
The Labor Department does n't rely on unemployment - benefit claims to calculate the unemployment rate ; instead the agency conducts interviews through a population survey and simply asks people if they have looked for work in the past four weeks .
If they have , they 're included in the rate .
So , if you have run through all of your benefits and say , " yes , " you would still impact the unemployment rate .
If you are unemployed and looking for work but are n't claiming benefits , you would be included as well .
Still , the weekly jobless claims number is a good indicator of the health and direction of the economy .
And Edward Stuart , an employment economics expert from Northeastern Illinois University , believes the NELP 's data may even be " conservative . "
" The unemployment rate is going up , and the time spent unemployed is also going up , " Stuart said .
" Jobs are disappearing , and we are n't replacing them . "
In the meantime , Ridinger waits -- checking about 80 Web sites daily and has applied for jobs all over the country in a variety of fields .
After almost a year , he 's had only one interview .
" This experience has hit me with every possible emotion , " he said .
" It 's humiliating , degrading .
I 've changed my complete attitude toward the system .
I just never expected to be a part of it . "

The summary
You may have noticed , for the past month or so I have been blogging about how to program in emacs lisp .
Most of the content that you find in the last fourteen posts is available in the elisp reference manual , albeit , in a more elaborate manner .
In my blog , I have tried to provide a simple and concise gist of what I consider the most basic and most important information that will enable one to program in emacs lisp .
This information should be really helpful to people who want to understand just enough of emacs lisp to start writing a few basic programs .
Once the basic concepts are understood , it is much easier to learn the more advanced concepts by looking in the info manual .
If you already know a programming language prior to this , then , you can breeze through most of the topics pertaining to the introduction to emacs lisp in my blog .
However , understanding the initial topics is what is going to be a challenge for you .
On the other hand , if you are a beginner then you might have the upper hand in the initial topics and then you will have to work hard to understand the later topics .
The topics discussed in the last fourteen posts is the route that I would reccommend any newcomer in lisp to take .
Another major reason for writing these posts is for me to recall the basics in case I forget or become rusty in ( emacs ) lisp .
Thus if you already know ( emacs ) lisp , the topics given below might help you , too , to refresh your knowledge a bit .
All topics can be accessed in reverse order by clicking here .
You can also access it by clicking on " introduction to Emacs Lisp " under the Index on the right .
Should be enough to get started .
I would recommend that you start by writing some functions to extend the emacs editor to do the things that you would like it to do .
A boy in Japan points out Styrofoam debris from the ocean .

In the first study to look at what happens over the years to the billions of pounds of plastic waste floating in the world 's oceans , scientists are reporting that plastics -- reputed to be virtually indestructible -- decompose with surprising speed and release potentially toxic substances into the water .
Reporting here today at the 238th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society ( ACS ) , the researchers termed the discovery " surprising . "
Scientists always believed that plastics in the oceans were unsightly , but a hazard mainly to marine animals that eat or become ensnared in plastic objects .
" Plastics in daily use are generally assumed to be quite stable , " said study lead researcher Katsuhiko Saido , Ph.D .
" We found that plastic in the ocean actually decomposes as it is exposed to the rain and sun and other environmental conditions , giving rise to yet another source of global contamination that will continue into the future . "
He said that polystyrene begins to decompose within one year , releasing components that are detectable in the parts - per-million range .
Those chemicals also decompose in the open water and inside marine life .
However , the volume of plastics in the ocean is increasing , so that decomposition products remain a potential problem .
Each year as much as 150,000 tons of plastic debris , most notably Styrofoam , wash up on the shores of Japan alone , Saido said .
Vast expanses of waste , consisting mainly of plastic , float elsewhere in the oceans .
The so - called Great Pacific Garbage Patch between California and Hawaii was twice the size of Texas and mainly plastic waste .
Saido , a chemist with the College of Pharmacy , Nihon University , Chiba , Japan , said his team found that when plastic decomposes it releases potentially toxic bisphenol A ( BPA ) and PS oligomer into the water , causing additional pollution .
Plastics usually do not break down in an animal 's body after being eaten .
However , the substances released from decomposing plastic are absorbed and could have adverse effects .
BPA and PS oligomer are sources of concern because they can disrupt the functioning of hormones in animals and can seriously affect reproductive systems .
Some studies suggest that low - level exposure to BPA released from certain plastic containers and the linings of cans may have adverse health effects .
Saido described a new method to simulate the breakdown of plastic products at low temperatures , such as those found in the oceans .
The process involves modeling plastic decomposition at room temperature , removing heat from the plastic and then using a liquid to extract the BPA and PS oligomer .
Typically , he said , Styrofoam is crushed into pieces in the ocean and finding these is no problem .
But when the study team was able to degrade the plastic , it discovered that three new compounds not found in nature formed .
They are styrene monomer ( SM ) , styrene dimer ( SD ) and styrene trimer ( ST ) .
SM is a known carcinogen and SD and ST are suspected in causing cancer .
BPA ands PS oligomer are not found naturally and , therefore , must have been created through the decomposition of the plastic , he said .
Trimer yields SM and SD when it decomposes from heat , so trimer also threatens living creatures .

On Monday the Democrat controlled House voted 226-202 to approve a rushed $ 106 billion dollar war spending bill , guaranteeing more carnage in Iraq and Afghanistan ( and lately Pakistan ) until September 30 , 2009 , which marks the end of the budget year .
The Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of the bill ’s first draft last month , with the final vote on a compromised version to occur in the Senate sometime in the next couple of weeks .
The majority of opposition in the House came from Republicans who opposed an add - on to the bill that would open up a $ 5 billion International Monetary Fund line of credit for developing countries .
This opposition in the House led Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday to quip , " It ’ll be interesting to see what happens here .
Are my Republican colleagues [ in the Senate ] going to join with us to fund the troops ?
I hope so . "
No longer can the blame for the turmoil in Iraq and Afghanistan rest at the feet of George W. Bush alone .
This is now Obama ’s War on Terror , fully funded and operated by the Democratic Party .
The bill that passed the House on Monday , once approved by the Senate , will not be part of the regular defense budget as it ’s off the books entirely .
Following the attacks on September 11 , 2001 , Congress has passed similar emergency spending bills to finance US military ventures in the Middle East .
The combined " supplementals " are fast approaching $ 1 trillion , with 30 % going to fund the war in Afghanistan .
In addition to the latest increase in war funds , Obama is also asking for an additional $ 130 billion to be added on to the defense budget for the new fiscal year starting on October 1 .
The president is upholding his campaign promise to escalate the war in Afghanistan , which also means increasing the use of remote controlled drone planes in neighboring Pakistan that are to blame for hundreds of civilian deaths since Obama took office last January .
Despite Obama ’s historic ( albeit rhetoric filled ) speech in Cairo , the new Commander in Chief is still not about to radically change , let alone reform , the US ’s long - standing role in the Middle East .
A master of his craft , Obama is simply candy coating the delivery of US imperialism in the region .
Given the lack of opposition to Obama ’s policies back home , it is becoming clear that he may well be more dangerous than his predecessor when it comes to the US ’s motivations internationally .
Had Bush pushed for more military funds at this stage , the antiwar movement ( if you can call it that ) would have been organizing opposition weeks in advance , calling out the neocons for wasting our scarce tax dollars during a recession on a never - ending , directionless war .
But since Obama ’s a Democrat , a beloved one at that , mums the word .
Certainly a few progressive Democrats are dismayed by what the Obama administration is up to , but how many of these Democrats that are upset now will be willing to break rank and oppose their party when it matters most , like during the midterm elections coming up next year ?
Obama had the majority of antiwar support shored up while he ran for the presidency , with absolutely no demands put on his candidacy .
And not surprisingly , antiwar progressives have little to show for their fawning support .
All this begs a few questions :
If not now , when exactly will Obama ’s policies be scrutinized with the same veracity that Bush ’s were ?
When will the media end its love affair with Obama and hold his feet to the fire like they did Bush once the wheels fell off the war in Iraq ?
When will progressives see their issues as paramount and oppose Obama and the Democratic Party until they embrace their concerns ?
If these questions are not answered soon , we are in many more years of war and bloodshed , funded by US taxpayers and approved by a Democrat controlled White House and Congress .

In this article by Jani Hartikainen , we ’ll look at PHP ’s “ magic ” features :
Magic methods , which are class methods with specific names , are used to perform various specialized tasks .
They are grouped into two : overloading methods and non-overloading methods .
Overloading magic methods are used when your code attempts to access a method or a property which does not exist .
Non-overloading methods perform other tasks .
Magic functions , which are similar to magic methods , but are just plain functions outside any class .
Currently there is only one magic function in PHP .
Magic constants , which are similar to constants in notation , but act more like “ dynamic ” constants – their value depends on where you use them .
We ’ll also look at some practical examples of using some of these , and lastly we ’ll check out what new features PHP 5.3 is going to add .
Magic methods
For starters , let ’s take a look at the magic methods PHP provides .
We will first go over the non-overloading methods .
__construct and __destruct
class SomeClass {
public function __construct ( ) {
}
public function __destruct ( ) {
}
}
The most common magic method in PHP is __construct .
In fact , you might not even have thought of it as a magic method at all , as it ’s so common .
__construct is the class constructor method , which gets called when you instantiate a new object using the new keyword , and any parameters used will get passed to __construct .
$ obj = new SomeClass ( ) ;
__destruct is __construct ’s “ pair ” .
It is a class destructor , which is rarely used in PHP , but still it is good to know about its existence .
It gets called when your object falls out of scope or is garbage collected .
function someFunc( ) {
$ obj = new SomeClass ( ) ;
// when the function ends , $ obj falls out of scope and SomeClass __destruct is called
}
someFunc ( ) ;
If you make the constructor private or protected , it means that the class cannot be instantiated , except inside a method of the same class .
You can use this to your advantage , for example to create a singleton .
__clone
class SomeClass {
public $ someValue ;
public function __clone ( ) {
$ clone = new SomeClass ( ) ;
$ clone ->someValue = $ this ->someValue ;
return $ clone ;
}
}
The __clone method is called when you use PHP ’s clone keyword , and is used to create a clone of the object .
The purpose is that by implementing __clone , you can define a way to copy objects .
$ obj1 = new SomeClass ( ) ;
$ obj1->someValue = 1 ;
$ ob j2 = clone $ obj1 ;
echo $ obj2->someValue ;
//echos 1
Important : __clone is not the same as =.
If you use = to assign an object to another variable , the other variable will still refer to the same object as the first one !
If you use the clone keyword , the purpose is to return a new object with similar state as the original .
Consider the following :
$ obj1 = new SomeClass ( ) ;
$ obj1->someValue = 1 ;
$ obj2 = $ obj1 ;
$ obj3 = clone $ obj1 ;
$ obj1->someValue = 2 ;
What are the values of the someValue property in $ obj2 and $ obj3 now ?
As we have used the assign operator to create $ obj2 , it refers to the same object as $ obj1 , thus $ obj2->someValue is 2 .
When creating $ obj3 , we have used the clone keyword , so the __clone method was called .
As __clone creates a new instance , $ obj3->someValue is still the same as it was when we cloned $ obj1 : 1 .
If you want to disable cloning , you can make __clone private or protected .
__toString
class SomeClass {
public function __toString ( ) {
return ' someclass ' ;
}
}
The __toString method is called when PHP needs to convert class instances into strings , for example when echoing :
$ obj = new SomeClass ( ) ;
echo $ obj ;
// will output ' someclass '
This can be a useful example to help you identify objects or when creating lists .
If we have a user object , we could define a __toString method which outputs the user ’s first and last names , and when we want to create a list of users , we could simply echo the objects themselves .
__sleep and __wakeup
class SomeClass {
private $ _someVar ;
public function __sleep ( ) {
return array ( '_someVar' ) ;
}
public function __wakeup ( ) {
}
}
These two methods are used with PHP ’s serializer : __sleep is called with serialize ( ) , __wakeup is called with unserialize ( ) .
Note that you will need to return an array of the class variables you want to save from __sleep .
That ’s why the example class returns an array with _someVar in it :
Without it , the variable will not get serialized .
$ obj = new SomeClass ( ) ;
$ serialized = serialize ( $obj ) ;
//__sleep was called
unserialize ( $ serialized ) ;
//__wakeup was called
You typically wo n’t need to implement __sleep and __wakeup , as the default implementation will serialize classes correctly .
However , in some special cases it can be useful .
For example , if your class stores a reference to a PDO object , you will need to implement __sleep , as PDO objects cannot be serialized .
As with most other methods , you can make __sleep private or protected to stop serialization .
Alternatively , you can throw an exception , which may be a better idea as you can provide a more meaningful error message .
An alternative to __sleep and __wakeup is the Serializable interface .
However , as its behavior is different from these two methods , the interface is outside the scope of this article .
You can find info on it in the PHP manual .
__set_state
class SomeClass {
public $ someVar ;
public static function __set_state ( $ state ) {
$ obj = new SomeClass ( ) ;
$ obj ->someVar = $ state [ ' someVar ' ] ;
return $ obj ;
}
}
This method is called in code created by var_export .
It gets an array as its parameter , which contains a key and value for each of the class variables , and it must return an instance of the class .
$ obj = new SomeClass ( ) ;
$ obj -> someVar = ' my value ' ;
var_export ( $obj ) ;
This code will output something along the lines of :
SomeClass::__set_state ( array ( ' someVar'= >' my value ' ) ) ;
Note that var_export will also export private and protected variables of the class , so they too will be in the array .
This Thai version of honey garlic chicken turns ordinary chicken breast or thigh into an amazing tasting meal , plus it 's easy to make .
Here we 've grilled it , but it 's just as wonderful baked in the oven ( both methods included here ) .
Makes a great dinner served together with rice or over a salad , or whatever side dishes you desire .
It 's the marinade that makes this recipe so good - and you can use this same marinade for other grilled or baked dishes as well , including all types of fish and seafood .
Great for serving guests too , as the sauce is mild enough even for kids and those with sensitive stomachs .
Enjoy !

After an emphatic start to the 2009/2010 campaign , Arsenal are set to be without their fearless leader and main midfielding man , Cesc Fabregas , for two big , vital clashes .
The Spaniard picked up a knock in the 4 - 1 thumping of Portsmouth last weekend and could to be sidelined for up to two weeks , this will mean missing Arsenal 's Champions League encounter with Celtic and the Gunners ' big match with rival and EPL Champions , Manchester United .
Both are must - win matches for the North London side , especially the clash with United as it could determine whether or not Arsenal are serious title contenders .
If Fabregas is unable to play , could French midfield Abou Diaby could be the key replacement .
After bagging to impressive goals in Arsenal 's 4 - 1 domination of Pompey , Wenger has hinted that Diaby has all the traits to be the next Patrick Vieira .
Diaby , who has struggled with injury ever since joining the Gunners in 2006 , is high in confidence and can create play similar to Cesc .
The 23 - year - old is blessed with strong , long legs which move quickly , confusing even the best of defenders .
The French international also has great pace and strength plus a fierce shot .
Although his passing is not as exquisite as the captain's , Diaby is a great attacking threat .
The encounter with Manchester is likely to come down to who has the better attack , and if Diaby can perform , Arsenal are sure to shine .
Germany 's economy has been hit by falling demand for its exports
German unemployment rose in June , official figures have shown , but the increase was smaller than expected .
The number of people out of work reached 3.495 million on a seasonally adjusted basis , a rise of 31,000 on May 's number , official figures showed .
Analysts had forecast a bigger rise of about 45,000 .
The jobless rate rose to 8.3 % from 8.2 % in May , the Federal Labour Office said .
On an unadjusted basis , unemployment fell by 48,000 from the previous month .
" [ We ] expect seasonally adjusted unemployment to rise throughout 2009 and 2010 , with monthly increments most likely to pick up during the second half of 2009 , " said Timo Klein from Global Insight .
" Employment has generally not fallen quite as fast as unemployment has been increasing , as firms aim to hold onto their existing workforce wherever possible . "
The RIAA has been awarded $ 675,000 in the case of Joel Tenenbaum , a student who illegally downloaded 30 songs .
If the award stands , Tenenbaum will be filing for bankruptcy .
Since Tenenbaum had already admitted to infringement , the jury 's instructions from the judge were to choose an amount between $ 750 and $ 150,000 per song .
The student told Ars Technica : " I'm thankful that it was n't much bigger , that it was n't millions " .
And compared to another recent ruling , he may have gotten away lightly : in June , Jammie Thomas - Rasset was ordered to pay $ 80,000 for each of the 24 songs she downloaded , making for a total of $ 1.92 million .
There 's no doubt that Tenenbaum broke the law , and appears to have continued to infringe copyright for years after receiving warnings and even after being sued .
His lawyer 's tactics , including the posting to his blog of audio recordings from the court , are said to have " infuriated the plaintiffs " .
$ 22,500 Per Song : Excessive ?
The question begging to be asked : how is a song worth $ 22,500 ?
Given that most tracks sell for $ 0.99 in iTunes , a 100 x multiple would put the fine at $ 99 per song .
A 1000 x multiple would lead to a fine of $ 990 .
You might say that it 's comparable to being fined $ 100,000 for stealing a comic book , except that in this case it would be more like photocopying the comic and leaving the original on the shelf .
It 's a question the judge is looking into , reports Ars Technica :
Judge Gertner previously announced that she will hold a post - trial proceeding to determine whether the size of the award violates the US Constitution ’s guarantee of due process of the law .
While no federal court has ever invalidated an award of copyright statutory damages as constitutionally excessive , the record labels ’ litigation campaign has spurred arguments that the Supreme Court cases imposing limits on punitive damages should be extended to statutory damages , which may contain a punitive element .
If a song is worth $ 22,500 , the record industry is truly giving us a bargain by selling them for $ 0.99 on iTunes .

Move the planet … now I heard everything
Scientists have found an unusual way to prevent our planet overheating : move it to a cooler spot .
All you have to do is hurtle a few comets at Earth , and its orbit will be altered .
Our world will then be sent spinning into a safer , colder part of the solar system .
This startling idea of improving our interplanetary neighbourhood is the brainchild of a group of Nasa engineers and American astronomers who say their plan could add another six billion years to the useful lifetime of our planet – effectively doubling its working life .
‘ The technology is not at all far - fetched , ’ said Dr Greg Laughlin , of the Nasa Ames Research Center in California .
‘ It involves the same techniques that people now suggest could be used to deflect asteroids or comets heading towards Earth .
We do n’t need raw power to move Earth , we just require delicacy of planning and manoeuvring . ’
The plan put forward by Dr Laughlin , and his colleagues Don Korycansky and Fred Adams , involves carefully directing a comet or asteroid so that it sweeps close past our planet and transfers some of its gravitational energy to Earth .
‘ Earth ’s orbital speed would increase as a result and we would move to a higher orbit away from the Sun , ’ Laughlin said .
Engineers would then direct their comet so that it passed close to Jupiter or Saturn , where the reverse process would occur .
It would pick up energy from one of these giant planets .
Later its orbit would bring it back to Earth , and the process would be repeated .
In the short term , the plan provides an ideal solution to global warming , although the team was actually concerned with a more drastic danger .
The sun is destined to heat up in about a billion years and so ‘ seriously compromise ’ our biosphere – by frying us .
Hence the group ’s decision to try to save Earth .
‘ All you have to do is strap a chemical rocket to an asteroid or comet and fire it at just the right time , ’ added Laughlin .
‘ It is basic rocket science . ’
The plan has one or two worrying aspects , however .
For a start , space engineers would have to be very careful about how they directed their asteroid or comet towards Earth .
The slightest miscalculation in orbit could fire it straight at Earth – with devastating consequences .
It is a point acknowledged by the group .
‘ The collision of a 100 - kilometre diameter object with the Earth at cosmic velocity would sterilise the biosphere most effectively , at least to the level of bacteria , ’ they state in a paper in Astrophysics and Space Science .
‘ The danger can not be overemphasised . ’
There is also the vexed question of the Moon .
As the current issue of Scientific American points out , if Earth was pushed out of its current position it is ‘ most likely the Moon would be stripped away from Earth , ’ it states , radically upsetting out planet ’s climate .
These criticisms are accepted by the scientists .
‘ Our investigation has shown just how delicately Earth is poised within the solar system , ’ Laughlin admitted .
‘ Nevertheless , our work has practical implications .
Our calculations show that to get Earth to a safer , distant orbit , it would have to pass through unstable zones and would need careful nurturing and nudging .
Any alien astronomers observing our solar system would know that something odd had occurred , and would realise an intelligent lifeform was responsible .
‘ And the same goes for us .
When we look at other solar systems , and detect planets around other suns – which we are now beginning to do – we may see that planet - moving has occurred .
It will give us our first evidence of the handiwork of extraterrestrial beings . ’

A man charged for triple murder in Norway this year sent in personal contact ad with the title “ Charged killer in Trondheim seeks ” .
How many replies do you think he got ?
In my head I would say 0 , who would be interested in such guy ?
But I was wrong , 84 women replied !
16 of them were married and 30 of them attached their nude photo .
I ’ve noticed some groups of women who is attracted by violent men and get beaten up , leaves them and later gets together again , or they find another violent guy .
What is with these women ?
Is it a mother instinct ?
In an interview the guy says that he looks forward meeting some of them , but when he soon get released he will leave the country .
While in prison he studies languages and teology .

North Korea views religion as a threat to its state ideology
Human rights groups in South Korea say North Korea has stepped up executions of Christians , some of them in public .
The communist country , the world 's most closed society , views religion as a major threat .
Only the founder of the country , Kim Il - sung , and his son , Kim Jong - il , may be worshipped , in mass public displays of fervour .
Despite the persecutions , it is thought up to 30,000 North Koreans may practise Christianity secretly in their homes .
A report by a number of South Korean groups highlights one particular case of a woman allegedly executed in public last month , in a northern town close to the Chinese border .
She was accused of distributing Bibles , spying for South Korea and the United States and helping to organise dissidents .
Her parents , husband , and children were sent to a prison camp .
Such reports are hard to verify , but North Korea is known to be intolerant of religion - it views any form of alternative social organisation as a competitor for its own , religion - like ideology .
The US government says just owning a Bible in North Korea may be a cause for torture and disappearance .
Pyongyang 's position appears to have hardened on everything from human rights to defence policy and international relations in the last year or so .
It is thought this may be a way to shore up the government through Mr Kim 's illness and the process of anointing his youngest son , Kim Jong - un , as North Korea 's next leader .

Sometimes , we overlook a critical aspect which could mean that our efforts of decade can be blasted within seconds .
Such is a bug found in Linux 2.4 Kernel .
According to security researchers , a bug in the Linux kernel has just been uncovered that makes just about every distribution utilizing kernel 2.4 and 2.6 on just about all architectures since May of 2001 vulnerable to a certain kind of attack .
You can imagine .
Out of Today ’s Linux systems , 95 % use > 2.4 < =2.6 , so almst every Linux kernel is Vulnerable to this attack .
The bug allows an attacker to escalate local privileges and completely compromise the entire system .
Julien Tinnes , a security researcher who does know his way around kernel code , wrote the following details about the bug .
At first sight , the code in af_ipx .c looks correct and seems to initialize . sendpage properly .
However , due to a bug in the SOCKOPS_WRAP macro , sock_sendpage will not be initialized .
This code is very fragile and there are many other protocols where proto_ops are not correctly initialized at all ( vulnerable even without the bug in SOCKOPS_WRAP ) …
Since it leads to the kernel executing code at NULL , the vulnerability is as trivial as it can get to exploit : an attacker can just put code in the first page that will get executed with kernel privileges .
Since it leads to the kernel executing code at NULL , the vulnerability is as trivial as it can get to exploit : an attacker can just put code in the first page that will get executed with kernel privileges .
Rodney Taylor , from security research at Secorix , said that the bug “ passes my it ’s - not - crying - wolf test so far , ” and that he ’d definitely check his enterprise Linux systems ( providing he had any ) , see if it was related , and see if he needed to get a patch .
The damage is done , fair enough but luckily , there already is a patch , and it should be implemented into all future kernels from here on out .
A Safer world again .

Not only is this illegal , it 's immoral and just plain crazy .
Keeping someone awake that long induces psychosis , and how does that give you useful information ?
Sounds like the Bush Administration was getting some kind of sick gratification from torturing people .
But of course , the Cowboy Administration was more interested in starring in their own action movie than in following our laws :
A year after the Bush administration abandoned its harshest interrogation methods , CIA operatives used severe sleep deprivation tactics against a terror detainee in late 2007 , keeping him awake for six straight days with permission from government lawyers .
Interrogators kept the unidentified detainee awake by chaining him to the walls and floor of a cell , according to government officials and memos issued with an internal CIA report .
The Obama administration released the internal report this week .
Though the detainee 's name and critical details are blacked out in the memos , there is only one detainee known to have been in CIA custody at that time : Mohammed Rahim al - Afghani , an alleged al - Qaida operator and translator for Osama bin Laden .
The documents show that even as the Bush administration was scaling back its use of severe interrogation techniques , the CIA was still pushing the boundaries of what the administration 's own legal counsel considered acceptable treatment .
The documents describe two instances in 2007 in which the CIA was allowed to exceed the guidelines set by Bush administration lawyers allowing prisoners to be kept awake for up to four days .
The first episode occurred in August 2007 , when interrogators were given permission from the Office of Legal Counsel to keep an unidentified detainee awake for five days , a U.S. government official confirmed .
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the report 's details .
According to the documents , the sleep - deprived prisoner was kept awake by being forced to stand with his arms chained above heart level .
He wore diapers , allowing interrogators to keep him chained continuously without bathroom breaks .
The second incident occurred in November 2007 .
After again asking permission from Justice lawyers to keep a detainee awake an extra day , interrogators pressed to extend the treatment for another 24 hours , depriving the prisoner of sleep for six straight days .
It is unclear from the documents whether the two incidents involved the same detainee .
CIA spokesman George Little would not provide the identity of the prisoner referred to in the document .
If you put a million monkeys at a million keyboards , one of them will eventually write a Java program .

— anonymous Internet wag
I was a laser printer guru in 1998 .
I spent most of my time talking to customers about printing and imaging .
I can probably find a blocked paper sensor on an HP LaserJet 5si ten years after my last experience troubleshooting the paper jam message .
( I can probably close my eyes and walk someone through it from memory . )
I delivered two programs in that job .
One was for the customer service department .
Every time someone from level one support had to ask a question of level two support , level two support needed to record the relevant product line .
These became daily , weekly , and monthly reports used to bill the subdepartment for each product for the service calls .
I was teaching myself Java at the time .
I wrote a small AWT GUI application ( in these days , that 's what you could get with the Java GNU / Linux port on Red Hat 5.3 ) which ran on a spare PC we set up at the level two support desk .
It logged all statistics to a flat file which another program -- I believe a Tcl program written by a co-worker -- summarized into the reports .
This program took a couple of weeks to write .
The program was still running when I last walked through that floor of that building in early 2000 .
My second program was for the networking support group .
In those days , internal support groups often managed the external - facing web site for their products .
They wanted a program which could identify when a page or pages in the web site changed and email an opt - in list of customers .
I thought about the problem and wrote a small Bourne shell script ( running on HP - UX 10.x , I believe ) to do the job .
The code must have been between ten and fifteen lines long .
As it happens , the networking group used IIS and an early Java application server plugin to manage their web site , so they wanted a Java program which ran on Windows .
They asked me to port my proof of concept to Java instead .
I never finished that program .
I switched to a system administrator role and discovered that the Perl I 'd dabbled with late in 1998 was a much better fit for the system administration and web development I needed to do .
The afternoon of my first day on the new job , the administrator I was replacing turned around and asked me if I knew Perl .
I 'd dabbled .
I 'd written a bit .
I could read a program and have some sense of what was happening .
I said " Some , yeah . "
He was working on a program and kept getting a weird syntax error .
I looked over his shoulder and said " That elseif should be an elsif . "
As I went through the files he left , I found several printouts of Perl programs he'd downloaded from the Internet , changed the copyrights , and tweaked very slightly .
If the department I worked in back then still exists ( and it might ) and if someone still remembers me from then ( doubtful ) , I 'd have no surprise to learn that some of the code I wrote there still exists .
( One evening I saved my group a million dollars in penalties by fixing a misbehaving FTP server right before a deadline to deliver new firmware images to a vendor .
They gave me a plaque . )
I 've toyed with Java some since then , but I have n't delivered any significant software in Java .
I hear it 's a passable language with some great libraries and effective tools .
I 've spent the intervening years understanding software development , helping create a testing culture , figuring out what 's wrong with object orientation and how to fix it , and learning how virtual machines work to help invent the future ( or at least drag mainstream dynamic languages kicking and screaming into the ' 90s ) .
I delivered that first Java program because I was stubborn and had a lot of spare time over that fortnight .
I 've delivered almost every Perl program since then because of Perl 's whipupitude factor .
That 's how the administrator I replaced could download a likely program , tweak a few things , and pass off a working solution as his own .
That 's how a motivated , mumble - something fledgling music performance major like me could write a proof of concept mail notification service in an hour with the Bourne shell and port it to Perl 5 in an afternoon and still not be sure which Java SMTP package actually worked back in 1998 .
I have no illusion that I wrote idiomatic Perl 5 code then .
( The Perl Renaissance had yet to begin . )
I doubt I 'd want to maintain that code now .
I would n't suggest it as a good example for novice developers to emulate .
Yet it did the job .
The sound of that code is the sound of me and my users and co-workers not banging their heads against the wall .
It 's the sound of a 30 second task repeated ten times a day -- and its concomitant context switch -- vanishing .
Anonymous Internet critics can shake their heads and wag their beards and tear their outer garments and throw dust in the air as they wail and weep that ugly Perl code exists and persists .
I 'm all for improving Perl code .
I believe in tests and refactoring and idioms and reuse and clarity and good naming and succinctness and encapsulation and proper factorization and favoring simplicity over cleverness .
I believe in teaching novices and guiding them and encouraging them to develop good habits and consider maintenance and understand what happens and how things work and to think not only about what they want to do but why and how to do so sustainably .
I want better defaults and clearer error messages and fewer rough patches where they can trip and stumble and skin their knees and elbows .
I want that very much .
Yet the whipupitude that lets novices -- and there are some six and a half billion people on the planet who 've never even thought they could write a useful computer program -- do useful things even if sometimes they do it the ugly way is a positive aspect of Perl .
It 's a positive aspect of many tools .
By all means let 's continue making Perl easier to understand and gentler to learn and more encouraging to write good code the right way .
That 's important .
We 're all novices sometimes .
Let 's help them get their work done and then help them get their jobs done well .
Programming well is difficult ; why not encourage them with small victories ?
Why make the barrier to accomplishment artificially high ?
I do n't understand that argument .
Then again , some people probably think that Pablo Neruda never existed after hearing me speak Spanish .
Rick Moran , I think , has the definitive post on the news of Mother Sheehan ’s retirement from the vocal anti-war movement .
Of course , the writing has been on the wall for Mother Sheehan for a while now .
She has n’t been drawing big crowds at her ‘ sit-ins ’ and she ’s turned into someone who is beyond embarassing to associate with , even for the hardcore anti-war left , who are known for not shying away from using embarassing tactics in order to get their ‘ points ’ across , so for them to have abandoned her - which they have been doing for the last year or so – you know it ’s gotten bad .
Cindy Sheehan allowed herself to be used by a group of users who did n’t mind shamelessly latching on to the troubled mother of a fallen soldier in order to try and gain the high ground by utilizing the Absolute Moral Authority Card , meaning that as a critic of the Bush adminstration , she was supposed to be untouchable and via extension , was supposed to make the anti-war movement untouchable .
As a result , criticism of Sheehan from the right was met with contempt and anger from an ‘ outraged ’ left .
We all remember three years ago when all we heard about in the summer of 2005 was Cindy Sheehan and her camp of hateful anti-war protestors camped out near the President ’s Crawford ranch .
We saw pictures galore , read stories all over the place , and for a while the news mediots screamed all - Cindy all the time .
That was when she served a purpose to anti-war lefties like Michael Moore and Code Pink , and their pals in the press .
Though Mother Sheehan ’s star has faded , the anti-war movement , fueled by like - minded Democrats in the House and Senate , have made themselves a force to be reckoned with and now , in effect , control the Democratic party .
Cindy Sheehan might be stepping out of the limelight , but the legacy of the anti-war movement , a movement she embodied for the last three years , lives on through the Daily Kos , the Huffington Post , and the Pelosi- led House and Reid- led Senate .
Updated to add : Meant to point out that in spite of her retirement , Sheehan and other anti-war moonbats will be in Charlotte on Friday in an effort to influence people to support an “ Impeach Bush / Cheney ” movement ( hat tip : William Teach ) .

Get updates impacting your industry from our GigaOm Research Community
Updated : Earlier this morning , veteran technology journalist John Dvorak posted an article on his blog with the headline : Is U.S. Chief Information Officer ( CIO ) Vivek Kundra a Phony ?
The report investigates Kundra ’s background — both educational and professional — and finds some gaps .
For instance , Dvorak could n’t find any records of Kundra ’s Masters degree in information technology .
Update : Chip Cassano , a University of Maryland University College spokesman , confirmed that Kundra graduated from the school with a Masters of Science in Information Systems Management .
There are several other issues — you are better off reading the entire article .
It is quite a shocker : I recently chatted with Kundra about cloud computing .
I reached out to the White House and a spokesperson dismissed the article as “ a gross smear ” on Kundra and called it “ highly inaccurate . ”
The spokesperson said that Kundra has excelled at his job as the U.S. CIO .
According to the spokesperson , the doubts might have arisen from the fact that Kundra went to University of Maryland ’s University College instead of College Park .
Those are two different colleges within the University of Maryland system .
“ If you are going to make such charges , make sure you call us and take the time to educate yourself , ” said the spokesperson .
“ It is a lie . ”
Dvorak is just flat - out wrong — or at least that was the gist of the conversation I just had with Kundra .
He called back and said that it was clear that “ someone was spinning partial truths . ”
He welcomed anyone to check with University of Maryland ’s University College and said they will find that not only did he graduate from the University College , but also that he was adjunct faculty member .
He was an undergraduate at the University of Maryland ’s College Park location .
That confusion is reflected on Kundra ’s Wikipedia bio .
As noted above , we checked with the UMUC and they told us that Kundra did indeed graduate in 2001 with an MS in information Systems Management .
When I asked Kundra about his startup , Creostar , he said he never claimed it to be a billion - dollar company .
He started it before getting a gig with the Commonwealth of Virginia .
Hmm , sounds like Atheism is becoming a Religion unto itself .
Why else would they need to have meetings and congregate ?
Hey , I 'm all for Atheists being protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights , just like everyone else , but sometimes you have to call a spade a spade .
If it looks like a duck , and quacks like a duck , then it is a duck ( and I ca n't believe I just quoted G. Bush ! ) .
I do agree that Alternative Religions , as well as Agnostics and Atheists are growing in leaps and bounds due to the failure of Mainstream Religions to adapt to the changing of times to the point where they have become not only irrelevant to many but an anachronistic nuisance to some .
However , it just seems to me that Atheism is going too far in promoting itself in such a way that it becomes a Religious Surrogate that will inevitably fall into the same sanctimonious trap that Mainstream Religions have .
America does n't need a Gymnasiarchy or a Pedantocracy , just as we do n't need a Theocracy .
There was a very good reason why Thomas Jefferson wrote about the wall of separation between church and state and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the US Constitution ... and as far as Government is concerned , the lack of a belief in a religion or God is a religious belief in and of itself , protected by the Constitution , and behind the wall of separation between church ( or in this case , lack thereof ) and state .
( Do n't get me wrong though , I do like the quote " What schools need is a moment of science " .
That could n't be more true ! )
Regjeringen har vedtatt en rekke nye obligatoriske IT - standarder for staten .
Nå blir det lettere for brukerne å få tilgang til grafikk - , video- , lyd- , bildemateriale som staten tilbyr , uavhengig av hvilken programvare og type datautstyr den enkelte bruker .
Fornyings - og administrasjonsdepartementet har dermed fullført trinn to i et langsiktig arbeid med å fastsette anbefalte og obligatoriske IT - standarder som offentlige virksomheter skal benytte .
De nye obligatoriske standardene er tatt inn i Referansekatalogen , som er tilgjengelig på www.regjeringen.no.
Fra før omfatter denne katalogen obligatoriske dokumentformater for publisering på Internett .
Hensikten med standardene er blant annet å sørge for enklere og mer effektiv elektronisk samhandling innen offentlig sektor og mellom offentlige virksomheter og brukerne .
- Alle brukere skal ha lik tilgang til offentlig informasjon og tjenester på Internett .
Staten skal ikke diskriminere brukere med bakgrunn i hva slags teknisk utstyr og programvare de benytter .
Gjennom dette vedtaket gir vi brukerne en rett til å se eller spille av multimediamateriale fra staten i åpne formater , som ikke er låst til enkeltleverandører i markedet , sier fornyingsminister Heidi Grande Røys .
I kortform er regjeringens vedtak dette :
På statlige Internett - sider er det fra 1.1.2012 obligatorisk å publisere multimediainnhold i åpne formater .
- For video skal det benyttes Theora / Vorbis / Ogg eller H.264/AAC /MP4 .
- For lyd skal det benyttes Vorbis / Ogg , MP3 eller FLAC / Ogg .
- For bilder skal det benyttes JPEG eller PNG .
- For video skal det benyttes Theora / Vorbis / Ogg eller H.264/AAC /MP4 . - For lyd skal det benyttes Vorbis / Ogg , MP3 eller FLAC / Ogg . - For bilder skal det benyttes JPEG eller PNG .
Ved utveksling av dokumenter som vedlegg til e-post mellom staten og brukere er det fra 1.1.2011 obligatorisk å benytte dokumentformatene PDF eller ODF .
Versjonsendring : fra 1.1.2010 er det ODF versjon 1.1 som skal benyttes .
Tegnsettstandarden ISO10646 , representert ved UTF8 , skal legges til grunn for alle nye IKT - prosjekter i staten .
Fra 1.1.2012 skal UTF8 benyttes ved elektronisk informasjonsutveksling .
Det er åpning for å gjøre unntak fra kravet i særlige tilfeller .
Vedtaket om UTF8 er et viktig steg i retning av at offentlig sektor skal håndtere samiske tegn og tegn fra andre språk på en korrekt måte .
I første omgang gjelder de obligatoriske kravene bare for staten .
Fornyings - og administrasjonsdepartementet planlegger en forskrift som vil gjøre at kommunal sektor også blir omfattet av de obligatoriske standardene .

The Revolt Begins Against
Obama 's Fascist Agenda
by Jeffrey Steinberg
[ PDF version of this article ]
June 22 — A coast - to - coast revolt , led by leading California and New York Democrats , has begun , against President Barack Obama 's plans to dismantle what remains of President Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal system of protection of the general welfare of America 's " forgotten majority . "
With unemployment skyrocketing all across the country , at rates approaching those of the Great Depression , President Obama 's so - called stimulus package has done nothing to reverse that trend , and his much - publicized plans to " reform " Medicare and Social Security are turning out to be nothing more than a replay of Hitler 's policies of euthanasia against the elderly , the sick , and other highly vulnerable segments of the American population ( see Documentation ) .
As the result of Lyndon LaRouche 's bold intervention , daring to publicly draw the parallels between the Obama health - care " reform " plan and Hitler 's Tiergarten - 4 ( T - 4 ) euthanasia program of 1939 - 41 , some leading Democratic Party circles have begun to wake up to the dangers of what the White House is peddling , and are now , for the first time , pushing back against the drive for the elimination of what Hitler himself called " lives not worthy to be lived . "
Sources within the leadership of the Democratic Party have confirmed to EIR that several recent White House actions catalyzed the break with the President and his top policy advisors .
First , the President outright rejected pleas from California Democratic Party leaders , that action be taken by the Federal government , to avoid a bankruptcy default by the state , when the fiscal year ends on June 30 .
Instead of providing loan guarantees and other assistance — small change compared to the $ 8 trillion bailout of Wall Street — the President , according to the sources , first demanded murderous cuts , in effect backing Republican Gov. Arnold " Terminator " Schwarzenegger against his own party .
Similar White House behind - the - scenes scheming is reportedly going on with New York City 's corporatist Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
One senior member of the California Congressional delegation candidly acknowledged that , eventually , the White House will take some action , because " California is too big to fail , " but the team of behavioral economist austerity freaks , led by Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag , want to force California to first slash vital social safety net programs , including welfare assistance to 1.6 million desperately poor Californians , equally drastic cuts in Medicaid , and wholesale firing of police , fire , and school personnel .
The White House intends to use California as the example for the entire country , and leading Democrats from California and New York have concluded that the President 's health - care schemes will further slash funding for medical care in the biggest , most heavily populated states .
Thus , on June 21 , Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) declared on national television , that she will not support the President 's health - care reform bill , because it will slash $ 6 billion from California 's health - care system , and will gut other large states .
Earlier , three leading House Democrats from the two states — Rep. Charles Rangel ( N.Y. ) , Rep. George Miller ( Calif . ) and Rep. Henry Waxman ( Calif . ) introduced a health - care reform bill that called for increases in Medicare payments , and rejected some other key components of the White House plan .
Their bill , which will be the subject of three separate Congressional hearings this week , was drafted after the three House leaders were brought to the White House by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( Calif . ) , to be haranged by President Obama , Orszag , and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , on the need to slash health - care expenditures to " save " Medicare and Medicaid , and extend insurance coverage to the uninsured .
The swindle of the White House plan was made transparently obvious , when the President issued a diktat :
There will be no consideration of any " single - payer " reform , and no attempt to crack down on the insurance companies and HMOs , with their 30 % overhead costs .
All the cuts will come from health - care services — including Federal aid to hospitals , which now covers the costs of treating the uninsured .
One senior U.S. intelligence official told EIR : " The Obama White House has totally caved in to the insurance companies and the HMOs . "
Social Security Is Next
The second development that crossed the line with a growing number of leading Democrats was the June 18 op - ed by Peter Orszag in the London Financial Times , in which he candidly declared that , once the health - care " reform " has been passed , the next target will be Social Security .
While the White House has acknowledged that , with the crash of the stock market , all schemes for privatization of Social Security are off the table , instead , the White House planners are pressing Democratic Party economists to back a massive increase in taxes on Social Security — for the lower 95 % of income brackets !
The backlash against the Obama health - care reform schemes , and , now , the planned trashing of Social Security — a backlash catalyzed by the LaRouche Political Action Committee 's mobilization , via a relentless campaign of video exposés on the LPAC website , and the release of an initial 200,000 - run pamphlet , caused such consternation at the White House , according to sources close to the Presidency , that a decision was made several weeks ago , that the President himself would have to go out and sell the plan .
Beginning on June 11 , with his town hall speech in Green Bay , Wisc. , the President has been on a berserker one - man sales campaign , to convince the American people and Congress to buy into the euthanasia schemes .
While it is true that Orszag , chief White House economic advisor Larry Summers , and Rahm Emanuel , on their own , could never defeat the LaRouche - led opposition to the killer health - care cuts , the President has not exactly turned the tide , with his personal touch .
Things got so bad that former Sen.
Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) , an architect of the Obama Presidential campaign , and a leading advocate of the creation of a national health - care board to impose mandatory cuts in services , went to the President last week , and urged him to back down from his drive to pass the health - care reforms by Oct.
1 . Daschle , a former Senate Majority Leader turned K Street lobbyist , seeing a looming disaster , argued that a delay in the campaign to ram through health - care cuts , would be far better than an outright strategic defeat .
But the President , according to sources in the White House , would hear nothing of it .
Instead , he scheduled a high - profile June 24 nationwide TV interview to push for the health - care agenda , offering ABC - TV all - day access to the White House , in a final effort to sell the killer scheme .
Why the desperate rush ?
One senior Congressional staffer laughed , when told that Rahm Emanuel has informed Congressional leaders that the President wants to sign the health care bill into law on Oct.
1 . " Oct. 1 is the start of the flu season , " the person said , " and everyone is scared to death that we are going to be hit with a killer pandemic of swine flu .
Any chance of passing cuts in health - care delivery , once the pandemic strikes , will be gone . "
Of course , the swine flu pandemic is not going to wait for the October flu season .
Already , the spread of the flu is out of control in parts of the world , and that includes parts of the United States .
Indeed , the Obama health - care " reform " plan , while gutting everything that President Franklin D. Roosevelt stood for , is totally in line with Britain 's Prince Philip and Prince Charles , who preach Malthusian genocide , and would welcome a biological holocaust that would wipe out 80 % of the human race .
The late Lord Bertrand Russell infamously wrote in the 1950s that he would welcome a " Black Death " once every generation , to radically reduce population — particularly the darker - skinned races .
Barack ' Hoover ' Obama
The revolt against Obama has spread beyond Congress and the Democratic Party apparatus with breathtaking speed .
The July 2009 issue of the 150 - year - old liberal magazine Harper's , has a cover-story , " Barack Hoover Obama : The Best and the Brightest Blow It Again . "
The author draws a compelling parallel between Presidents Herbert Hoover and Barack Obama , contrasting both to FDR , who went to war with Wall Street , to save America from the depths of the Great Depression .
" Much like Herbert Hoover , " author Kevin Baker wrote , " Barack Obama is a man attempting to realize a stirring new vision of his society without cutting himself free from the dogmas of the past — without accepting the inevitable conflict .
Like Hoover , he is bound to fail ....
" Still worse is Obama 's decision to leave the reordering of the financial world solely to Larry Summers and Timothy Geithner , both of whom played such a major role in deregulating Wall Street and bringing on the disaster in the first place .
It 's as if , after winning election in 1932 , FDR had brought Andrew Mellon back to the Treasury .
Just as Herbert Hoover could not , in the end , break away from the best economic advice of the 1920s , Barack Obama is sticking with the ' key men ' of the 1990s . "
And the latest poll data from Gallup and other agencies shows that , while the President still enjoys a better - than - 60 % approval rating , when asked about the Obama Administration 's economic policies , people gave thumbs down — with under 30 % supporting his handling of the bank bailout .
That kind of gap spells disaster , especially for a President who lives and breathes by his belief that he can do no wrong .
The majority of personal injury cases never see the inside of a courtroom ; it ’s a lot more common for the injured person and the insurance provider responsible for the claim to accept a negotiation beyond the court .
However , this also implies that several injury attorneys also rarely see in a courtroom .
They are trying a case before a court can be pricey for a trial attorney , who usually spends for expert testimony and other trial costs out of his pocket ( to be paid off from the settlement or verdict ) in preparing your instance .
So some injury attorneys prefer to prevent most likely trials whenever feasible .
Frequently , the legal representatives that invest the most in advertising , particularly direct - mail advertising , are not the ones who are most willing to deal with the insurance provider in a courtroom if the business does not offer appropriate payment for your injuries .
If so few situations end up before a court , why is it essential to employ a trial attorney to work with your case ?
When an Alberta injury lawyer will do anything to prevent litigation , he establishes a track record among his peers and insurance providers .
When insurance companies know that a particular attorney balks at suggesting court cases , that lawyer loses a great deal of power at the bargaining table when attempting to discuss settlements for his clients .
The insurer ’s function is to pay cases ; however , the goal of insurance companies as profit - making companies is to lower the amount they pay out as much as they can manage .
Injury attorneys convince insurance providers to pay their customers higher than the bare minimum .
In part , by persuading the insurance company that the injured client would undoubtedly win an even more significant damage honour from a jury .
When the insurance company knows that an injury lawyer Alberta will not take a situation to court , the lawyer sheds one of his best - negotiating devices .
Without the risk of a trial , the insurance company has much less motivation to take your case seriously .
And perversely , since the injury lawyer knows he does n’t wish to be most likely to trial , he might push you to accept a settlement worth much less than what you should have .
Employing an expert trial lawyer to deal with your injury claim from the very beginning permits you to negotiate from a position of a lot more prominent quality .
In the same way that injury attorneys who wait to go to court create a track record among insurance policy companies , a great trial attorney will be well recognized for his desire to deal with insurance firms in the courtroom .
Lawyers who regularly pursue injury suits in court have many more resources readily obtainable to build your case .
They include specialists who usually work with them to provide vital testimony regarding medical problems or other topics commonly entailed in accident injury cases .
A lawyer who is n’t reluctant to go to trial will assemble you the ideal situation from the beginning , helping you accumulate proof and monitor the clinical costs and different expenses emerging from your injuries .
If you find yourself currently dealing with a personal injury lawyer on your injury case and discover that he hesitates to take your case to court , or he leans on you to approve a negotiation deal , that ’s a lot less than what you expected .
You still have the alternative of finishing the professional relationship and employing an experienced trial attorney .
However , it ’s much easier to work with an attorney you can trust to fight for you from the very beginning when evidence for your claim is being collected .
How can a nonprofessional who has never required a lawyer ’s solutions before coming to be injured tell the difference between an attorney who will go to the mat for them and one who is trial - phobic ?
Marketing is generally of little help ; those letters you obtain from a handful ( or more ) of attorneys asking you to call them instantly to become a client , or the unlawful “ runner ” that approaches you in the emergency room ( NEVER employ an attorney like that ! ) .
Also , billboards , bus ads , and radio spots wo n’t tell you when a lawyer with the trustworthy - looking smile will shy away from bringing a match to court or pressure you to accept an inadequate settlement .
The better choice is to attempt the old , trusted technique of discovering a great attorney : personal suggestions and recommendations .
If you have a friend or family member that has been in an accident in the past and had a good experience with their accident attorney Alberta , you must think about that lawyer .
However , the terrific equalizer in modern society is the internet .
With the web available , you should likewise go on the internet to seek a highly pertained to an attorney .
You can get a great idea concerning an attorney ’s efficiency , and also about the way he treats his customers , by reviewing the former client ’s reviews as well as comments .
" TomDispatch " --
The actor Will Smith is no one 's image of a suicide bomber .
With his boyish face , he has often played comic roles .
Even as the last man on earth in I Am Legend , he retains a wise - cracking , ironic demeanor .
By John Feffer " TomDispatch " --
The actor Will Smith is no one 's image of a suicide bomber .
With his boyish face , he has often played comic roles .
Even as the last man on earth in I Am Legend , he retains a wise - cracking , ironic demeanor .
And yet , surrounded by a horde of hyperactive vampires at the end of that film , Smith clasps a live grenade to his chest and throws himself at the enemy in a final burst of heroic sacrifice .
Wait a second : surely that was n't a suicide bombing .
Will Smith was n't reciting suras from the Koran .
He was n't sporting one of those rising sun headbands that the Japanese kamikaze wore for their suicide missions .
He was n't playing a religious fanatic or a political extremist .
Will Smith was the hero of the film .
So how could he be a suicide bomber ?
After all , he 's one of us , is n't he ?
As it happens , we have our suicide bombers too .
" We " are the powerful , developed countries , the ones with an overriding concern for individual liberties and individual lives .
" We " form a moral archipelago that encompasses the United States , Europe , Israel , present - day Japan , and occasionally Russia .
Whether in real war stories or inspiring vignettes served up in fiction and movies , our lore is full of heroes who sacrifice themselves for motherland , democracy , or simply their band of brothers .
Admittedly , these men were n't expecting 72 virgins in paradise and they did n't make film records of their last moments , but our suicidal heroes generally have received just as much praise and recognition as " their " martyrs .
The scholarly work on suicide bombers is large and growing .
Most of these studies focus on why those other people do such terrible things , sometimes against their own compatriots but mainly against us .
According to the popular view , Shiite or Tamil or Chechen suicide martyrs have a fundamentally different attitude toward life and death .
If , however , we have our own rich tradition of suicide bombers -- and our own unfortunate tendency to kill civilians in our military campaigns -- how different can these attitudes really be ?
Western JihadIn America 's first war against Islam , we were the ones who introduced the use of suicide bombers .
Indeed , the American seamen who perished in the incident were among the U.S. military 's first missing in action .
It was September 4 , 1804 .
The United States was at war with the Barbary pirates along the North African coast .
The U.S. Navy was desperate to penetrate the enemy defenses .
Commodore Edward Preble , who headed up the Third Mediterranean Squadron , chose an unusual stratagem : sending a booby - trapped U.S.S.
Intrepid into the bay at Tripoli , one of the Barbary states of the Ottoman empire , to blow up as many of the enemy 's ships as possible .
U.S. sailors packed 10,000 pounds of gunpowder into the boat along with 150 shells .
When Lieutenant Richard Sommers , who commanded the vessel , addressed his crew on the eve of the mission , a midshipman recorded his words : " ' No man need accompany him , who had not come to the resolution to blow himself up , rather than be captured ; and that such was fully his own determination ! '
Three cheers was the only reply .
The gallant crew rose , as a single man , with the resolution yielding up their lives , sooner than surrender to their enemies : while each stepped forth , and begged as a favor , that he might be permitted to apply the match !
"
The crew of the boat then guided the Intrepid into the bay at night .
So as not to be captured and lose so much valuable gunpowder to the enemy , they chose to blow themselves up with the boat .
The explosion did n't do much damage -- at most , one Tripolitan ship went down -- but the crew was killed just as surely as the two men who plowed a ship piled high with explosives into the U.S.S.
Cole in the Gulf of Aden nearly 200 years later .
Despite the failure of the mission , Preble received much praise for his strategies .
" A few brave men have been sacrificed , but they could not have fallen in a better cause , " opined a British navy commander .
The Pope went further : " The American commander , with a small force and in a short space of time , has done more for the cause of Christianity than the most powerful nations of Christiandom have done for ages !
" Preble chose his tactic because his American forces were outgunned .
It was a Hail Mary attempt to level the playing field .
The bravery of his men and the reaction of his supporters could be easily transposed to the present day , when " fanatics " fighting against similar odds beg to sacrifice themselves for the cause of Islam and garner the praise of at least some of their religious leaders .
The blowing up of the Intrepid was not the only act of suicidal heroism in U.S. military history .
We routinely celebrate the brave sacrifices of soldiers who knowingly give up their lives in order to save their unit or achieve a larger military mission .
We commemorate the sacrifice of the defenders of the Alamo , who could have , after all , slunk away to save themselves and fight another day .
The poetry of the Civil War is rich in the language of sacrifice .
In Phoebe Cary 's poem " Ready " from 1861 , a black sailor , " no slavish soul had he , " volunteers for certain death to push a boat to safety .
The heroic sacrifices of the twentieth century are , of course , commemorated in film .
Today , you can buy several videos devoted to the " suicide missions " of American soldiers .
Our World War II propaganda films -- er , wartime entertainments -- often featured brave soldiers facing certain death .
In Flying Tigers ( 1942 ) , for example , pilot Woody Jason anticipates the Japanese kamikaze by several years by flying a plane into a bridge to prevent a cargo train from reaching the enemy .
In Bataan ( 1943 ) , Robert Taylor leads a crew of 13 men in what they know will be the suicidal defense of a critical position against the Japanese .
With remarkable sangfroid , the soldiers keep up the fight as they are picked off one by one until only Taylor is left .
The film ends with him manning a machine gun against wave upon wave of oncoming Japanese .
Our warrior culture continues to celebrate the heroism of these larger - than - life figures from World War II by taking real - life stories and turning them into Hollywood - style entertainments .
For his series of " war stories " on Fox News , for instance , Oliver North narrates an episode on the Doolittle raid , an all - volunteer mission to bomb Tokyo shortly after Pearl Harbor .
Since the bombers did n't have enough fuel to return to their bases , the 80 pilots committed to what they expected to be a suicide mission .
Most of them survived , miraculously , but they had been prepared for the ultimate sacrifice -- and that is how they are billed today .
" These are the men who restored the confidence of a shaken nation and changed the course of the Second World War , " the promotional material for the episode rather grandly reports .
Tokyo had the same hopes for its kamikaze pilots a few years later .
Why Suicide Missions ?
America did not , of course , dream up suicide missions .
They form a rich vein in the Western tradition .
In the Bible , Samson sacrificed himself in bringing down the temple on the Philistine leadership , killing more through his death than he did during his life .
The Spartans , at Thermopylae , faced down the Persians , knowing that the doomed effort would nevertheless delay the invading army long enough to give the Athenians time to prepare Greek defenses .
In the first century AD in the Roman province of Judea , Jewish Zealots and Sicarians ( " dagger men " ) launched suicide missions , mostly against Jewish moderates , to provoke an uprising against Roman rule .
Later , suicide missions played a key role in European history .
" Books written in the post - 9/11 period tend to place suicide bombings only in the context of Eastern history and limit them to the exotic rebels against modernism , " writes Niccolo Caldararo in an essay on suicide bombers .
" A study of the late 19th century and early 20th would provide a spate of examples of suicide bombers and assassins in the heart of Europe . "
These included various European nationalists , Russian anarchists , and other early practitioners of terrorism .
Given the plethora of suicide missions in the Western tradition , it should be difficult to argue that the tactic is unique to Islam or to fundamentalists .
Yet some scholars enjoy constructing a restrictive genealogy for such missions that connects the Assassin sect ( which went after the great sultan Saladin in the Levant in the twelfth century ) to Muslim suicide guerrillas of the Philippines ( first against the Spanish and then , in the early twentieth century , against Americans ) .
They take this genealogy all the way up to more recent suicide campaigns by Hezbollah , Hamas , al - Qaeda , and Islamic rebels in the Russian province of Chechnya .
The Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka , who used suicide bombers in a profligate fashion , are ordinarily the only major non-Muslim outlier included in this series .
Uniting our suicide attackers and theirs , however , are the reasons behind the missions .
Three salient common factors stand out .
First , suicidal attacks , including suicide bombings , are a " weapon of the weak , " designed to level the playing field .
Second , they are usually used against an occupying force .
And third , they are cheap and often brutally effective .
We commonly associate suicide missions with terrorists .
But states and their armies , when outnumbered , will also launch such missions against their enemies , as Preble did against Tripoli or the Japanese attempted near the end of World War II .
To make up for its technological disadvantages , the Iranian regime sent waves of young volunteers , some unarmed and some reportedly as young as nine years old , against the then - U.S. - backed Iraqi army in the Iran - Iraq War of the 1980s .
Non-state actors are even more prone to launch suicide missions against occupying forces .
Remove the occupying force , as Robert Pape argues in his groundbreaking book on suicide bombers , Dying to Win , and the suicide missions disappear .
It is not a stretch , then , to conclude that we , the occupiers ( the United States , Russia , Israel ) , through our actions , have played a significant part in fomenting the very suicide missions that we now find so alien and incomprehensible in Iraq , Afghanistan , Chechnya , Lebanon , and elsewhere .
The archetypal modern suicide bomber first emerged in Lebanon in the early 1980s , a response to Israel 's invasion and occupation of the country .
" The Shiite suicide bomber , " writes Mike Davis in his book on the history of the car bomb , Buda 's Wagon , " was largely a Frankenstein monster of [ Israeli Defense Minister ] Ariel Sharon 's deliberate creation . "
Not only did U.S. and Israeli occupation policies create the conditions that gave birth to these missions , but the United States even trained some of the perpetrators .
The U.S. funded Pakistan 's intelligence service to run a veritable insurgency training school that processed 35,000 foreign Muslims to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
Charlie Wilson's
War , the book and movie that celebrated U.S. assistance to the mujihadeen , could be subtitled : Suicide Bombers We Have Known and Funded .
Finally , the technique " works . "
Suicide bombers kill 12 times more people per incident than conventional terrorism , national security specialist Mohammed Hafez points out .
The U.S. military has often publicized the " precision " of its airborne weaponry , of its " smart " bombs and missiles .
But in truth , suicide bombers are the " smartest " bombers because they can zero in on their target in a way no missile can -- from close up -- and so make last - minute corrections for accuracy .
In addition , by blasting themselves to smithereens , suicide bombers can't give away any information about their organization or its methods after the act , thus preserving the security of the group .
You can't argue with success , however bloodstained it might be .
Only when the tactic itself becomes less effective or counterproductive , does it recede into the background , as seems to be the case today among armed Palestinian groups .
Individual motives for becoming a suicide bomber or attacker have , when studied , proved to be surprisingly diverse .
We tend to ascribe heroism to our soldiers when , against the odds , they sacrifice themselves for us , while we assume a glassy - eyed fanaticism on the part of those who go up against us .
But close studies of suicide bombers suggest that they are generally not crazy , nor -- another popular explanation -- just acting out of abysmal poverty or economic desperation ( though , as in the case of the sole surviving Mumbai suicide attacker put on trial in India recently , this seems to have been the motivation ) .
" Not only do they generally not have economic problems , but most of the suicide bombers also do not have an emotional disturbance that prevents them from differentiating between reality and imagination , " writes Anat Berko in her careful analysis of the topic , The Path to Paradise .
Despite suggestions from Iraqi and U.S. officials that suicide bombers in Iraq have been coerced into participating in their missions , scholars have yet to record such cases .
Perhaps , however , this reflects a narrow understanding of coercion .
After all , our soldiers are indoctrinated into a culture of heroic sacrifice just as are the suicide bombers of Hamas .
The indoctrination does n't always work : scores of U.S. soldiers go AWOL or join the peace movement just as some suicide bombers give up at the last minute .
But the basic - training techniques of instilling the instinct to kill , the readiness to follow orders , and a willingness to sacrifice one 's life are part of the warrior ethic everywhere .
Suicide missions are , then , a military technique that armies use when outmatched and that guerrilla movements use , especially in occupied countries , to achieve specific objectives .
Those who volunteer for such missions , whether in Iraq today or on board the Intrepid in 1804 , are usually placing a larger goal -- liberty , national self - determination , ethnic or religious survival -- above their own lives .
But wait : surely I 'm not equating soldiers going on suicide missions against other soldiers with terrorists who blow up civilians in a public place .
Indeed , these are two distinct categories .
And yet much has happened in the history of modern warfare -- in which civilians have increasingly become the victims of combat -- to blur these distinctions .
Terror and Civilians
The conventional picture of today 's suicide bomber is a young man or woman , usually of Arab extraction , who makes a video proclamation of faith , straps on a vest of high explosives , and detonates him or herself in a crowded pizzeria , bus , marketplace , mosque , or church .
But we must expand this picture .
The September 11th hijackers targeted high - profile locations , including a military target , the Pentagon .
Hezbollah 's suicidal truck driver destroyed the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut on October 23 , 1983 , killing 241 U.S. soldiers .
Thenmozhi Rajaratnam , a female Tamil suicide bomber , assassinated Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 .
Suicide bombers , in other words , have targeted civilians , military installations , non-military sites of great significance , and political leaders .
In suicide attacks , Hezbollah , Tamil Tiger , and Chechen suicide bombers have generally focused on military and police targets : 88 % , 71 % , and 61 % of the time , respectively .
Hamas , on the other hand , has largely targeted civilians ( 74 % of the time ) .
Sometimes , in response to public opinion , such movements will shift focus -- and targets .
After a 1996 attack killed 91 civilians and created a serious image problem , the Tamil Tigers deliberately began chosing military , police , and government targets for their suicide attacks .
" We do n't go after kids in Pizza Hut , " one Tiger leader told researcher Mia Bloom , referring to a Hamas attack on a Sbarro outlet in Jerusalem that killed 15 civilians in 2001 .
We have been conditioned into thinking of suicide bombers as targeting civilians and so putting themselves beyond the established conventions of war .
As it happens , however , the nature of war has changed in our time .
In the twentieth century , armies began to target civilians as a way of destroying the will of the population , and so bringing down the leadership of the enemy country .
Japanese atrocities in China in the 1930s , the Nazi air war against Britain in World War II , Allied fire bombings of German and Japanese cities , the nuclear attacks against Hiroshima and Nagasaki , U.S. carpet bombing in Cambodia and Laos , and the targeted assassinations of the Phoenix program during the Vietnam War , Russian depredations in Afghanistan and Chechnya , the tremendous civilian casualties during the Iraq War : all this has made the idea of conventional armies clashing in an area far from civilian life a quaint legacy of the past .
Terrorist attacks against civilians , particularly September 11th , prompted military historian Caleb Carr to back the Bush administration 's declaration of a war against terror .
" War can only be answered with war , " he wrote in his best - selling The Lessons of Terror .
" And it is incumbent on us to devise a style of war more imaginative , more decisive , and yet more humane than anything terrorists can contrive . "
This more imaginative , decisive , and humane style of war has , in fact , consisted of stepped - up aerial bombing , beefed - up Special Forces ( to , in part , carry out targeted assassinations globally ) , and recently , the widespread use of unmanned aerial drones like the Predator and the Reaper , both in the American arsenal and in 24/7 use today over the Pakistani tribal borderlands .
" Predators can become a modern army 's answer to the suicide bomber , " Carr wrote .
Carr 's argument is revealing .
As the U.S. military and Washington see it , the ideal use of Predator or Reaper drones , armed as they are with Hellfire missiles , is to pick off terrorist leaders ; in other words , a mirror image of what that Tamil Tiger suicide bomber ( who picked off the Indian prime minister ) did somewhat more cost effectively .
According to Carr , such a strategy with our robot planes is an effective and legitimate military tactic .
In reality , though , such drone attacks regularly result in significant civilian casualties , usually referred to as " collateral damage . "
According to researcher Daniel Byman , the drones kill 10 civilians for every suspected militant .
As Tom Engelhardt of TomDispatch.com writes , " In Pakistan , a war of machine assassins is visibly provoking terror ( and terrorism ) , as well as anger and hatred among people who are by no means fundamentalists .
It is part of a larger destabilization of the country .
" So , the dichotomy between a " just war , " or even simply a war of any sort , and the unjust , brutal targeting of civilians by terrorists has long been blurring , thanks to the constant civilian casualties that now result from conventional war - fighting and the narrow military targets of many terrorist organizations .
Moral Relativism ?
We have our suicide bombers -- we call them heroes .
We have our culture of indoctrination -- we call it basic training .
We kill civilians -- we call it collateral damage .
Is this , then , the moral relativism that so outrages conservatives ?
Of course not .
I 've been drawing these comparisons not to excuse the actions of suicide bombers , but to point out the hypocrisy of our black - and - white depictions of our noble efforts and their barbarous acts , of our worthy goals and their despicable ends .
We -- the inhabitants of an archipelago of supposedly enlightened warfare -- have been indoctrinated to view the atomic bombing of Hiroshima as a legitimate military target and September 11th as a heinous crime against humanity .
We have been trained to see acts like the attack in Tripoli as American heroism and the U.S.S .
Cole attack as rank barbarism .
Explosive vests are a sign of extremism ; Predator missiles , of advanced sensibility .
It would be far better if we opened our eyes when it came to our own world and looked at what we were actually doing .
Yes , " they " sometimes have dismaying cults of sacrifice and martyrdom , but we do too .
And who is to say that ending occupation is any less noble than making the world free for democracy ?
Will Smith , in I Am Legend , was willing to sacrifice himself to end the occupation of vampires .
We should realize that our soldiers in the countries we now occupy may look no less menacing and unintelligible than those obviously malevolent , science - fiction creatures .
And the presence of our occupying soldiers sometimes inspires similar , Will Smith - like acts of desperation and , dare I say it , courage .
The fact is :
Were we to end our occupation policies , we would go a long way toward eliminating " their " suicide bombers .
But when and how will we end our own cult of martyrdom ?

He was a great coach -- a Hall of Fame coach .
And he 's usually fun to watch on ESPN .
The question is , can he win a seat in the US Congress ?
That 's what former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz is thinking about .
Holtz is considering running for the seat currently held by Suzanne Kosmas , a Democrat in Central Florida .
Certainly it would n't be the first time a coach has moved from college football to the halls of Congress .
Former Nebraska Cornhuskers head coach Tom Osborne served in Congress for six years following his remarkable record on the football field .
One sports reporter in Florida thinks a Holtz victory is in the bag .
" If he does run , Kosmas probably has as much a shot at beating Holtz as Baylor had at beating Notre Dame during the years Holtz coached the Irish .
It might not be pretty , " writes Todd Wright .
It might not be pretty .
But for a different reason than the sportswriter thinks .
After all , the more you 're on the record , the more of a trail you leave .
And Holtz has been on the record a lot .
Like last year , when he said that " Hitler was a great leader . "
He actually said that .
Of course , there 's context here ( something that campaign commercials always leave out ) .
And a lot of reporters left that out when the remarks were first uttered .
Last October , Holtz was discussing Michigan head coach Rich Rodriguez 's rough first year as the head coach of the Wolverines .
While discussing leadership , ESPN co-host Mark May said to Holtz , " You have to have leaders in the locker room to get the team and the young players to buy into what the coach is teaching you . "
Holtz replied , " Let 's remember this , Hitler was a great leader , too .
There are good leaders and bad leaders . "
What did he mean ?
ESPN ombudsman Le Anne Schreiber put it this way :
In context , his garbled but detectable meaning was beware what you wish for .
You wish for a strong leader , you may end up with a Hitler .
Understanding both the context and the danger of misinterpretation , ' GameDay ' anchor Rece Davis leapt in after Holtz with , " OK , and meaning obviously , that he was a very bad leader . "
Later , Davis told me , " It 's been very frustrating to read some of the things that have been written .
Much of it was a complete mischaracterization of the discussion .
There 's no way it was implied , nor should it have been inferred , that Lou drew any comparison between Rich Rodriguez and Hitler .
He was making a point about establishing leaders in the locker room who lead in the right direction as opposed to the wrong one .
Anyone who wrote otherwise either did n't see the discussion or was n't listening . "
However it was meant , controversy erupted quickly as did calls for his firing .
He was n't let go but made plenty of apologies for the statement .
" Last night while trying to make a point about leadership , I made an unfortunate reference , " Holtz said the day after .
" It was a mistake and I sincerely apologize . "
Regardless of the controversy , the chairman of the Orange County Republican Executive Committee in Orlando told the Associated Press that Holtz may suffer from something else -- no one knows who he is .
" I doubt sincerely that 90 percent of the people who live in that district have heard the name before , " said Lew Oliver .
" It would be different if the guy was named Bob Griese or Don Shula , or someone with Florida connections . "
------------
Hey , if Bob Griese or Don Shula or even all of the 1972 Dolphins ( as a group ) decide to run for Congress , we 'll let you know about it on Twitter !

The world food market is still " seriously exposed " to speculators artificially driving up prices and worsening the risks of malnutrition , according to one of the world 's leading agricultural researchers .
Linking the recent food and financial crises , Joachim von Braun , the head of the International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) , warned that the world was at risk of a new panic over grain unless commodity markets were more tightly regulated and production expanded .
" The banking sector is in the process of being re-regulated worldwide , but the food market remains seriously exposed to short - term flows of indexed funds into commodity exchanges .
That vulnerability needs to be addressed , " he said in an interview with the Guardian .
Von Braun was one of the first to predict the sharp rise in food prices that peaked last year , when 13 nations halted cross - border trade amid fears of shortages .
The crisis , which escalated over four years , hit poor people hardest and saw pasta protests in Italy , tortilla rallies in Mexico and onion demonstrations in India .
During that period , the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates the number of hungry people in the world rose from about 800 million to more than 1 billion .
At the time , most of the blame for the price spike centred on growing populations , climate change , biofuels , rising oil prices and increased demand from fast - growing economies like China and India that were running down food stocks .
But von Braum said recent research highlighted the role of commodity speculators : " What we did n't foresee two years ago is how speculation exacerbated the real market issues .
It was not a primary cause but a second - round amplifier , which added seriously to the problem . "
Daily trading volumes on the Chicago commodities exchange surged at the peak of the crisis between December 2007 and March 2008 , boosted by the entry of non-commercial investors entering the market to speculate .
" When food supply is at risk , speculators are attracted , especially when trade barriers are put in place , " he warned .
Exchanges in India and China were closed down to prevent similar speculative attacks .
The global credit crunch also hamstrung government efforts to boost food production by reducing the money available for investment in new technology and better irrigation .
With climate change expected to reduce yields by 15 % by 2050 even as demand grows from a rising world population , von Braum said it was important for nations and international institutions to respond with more funds for agriculture .
China , Japan , South Korea and several Middle Eastern nations have begun buying up farmland in Africa and South America as a hedge against food shortage risks .
Global prices are down from their peak thanks partly to effective measures by the Chinese government to rebuild grain stocks , increased agricultural investment in India and a great focus on food production in the aid programmes of the UK and other donor nations .
But von Braun said prices remain high in many African countries because of trade constraints and foreign exchange rates , while an unusually dry Indian monsoon could affect harvests in Asia .
A UN report published earlier this week warned that Asia faces dire food shortages unless hundreds of billions of dollars are invested in better irrigation systems to grow crops for its growing population .
" Fundamentally , the crisis of high food prices in the majority of poor countries is not over at all , " said von Braun .
John Yoo ’s Defense of Himself Is as Persuasive as Most of His Legal Opinions
Created : July 16 , 2009 09:06 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
This is your horrible , dystopian future : John Yoo , the former Office of Legal Counsel official who had a hand in crafting the Bush administration ’s detentions , interrogations and warrantless surveillance abuses , writes endless and endlessly misleading defenses of himself .
Some people die because of Yoo ’s cavalier relationship with the law — about 100 , actually — and others get law school sinecures and limitless op - ed real estate to explain away what they did .
Few people write so much for so long with so little self - reflection .
You ’ll be reading these op - eds in the nursing home .
Yoo ’s latest comes in response to Friday ’s report from five inspectors general about the warrantless surveillance and data - mining escapades of the Bush administration .
Welcome to your future .
Yoo starts things off with his typical flourish of disingenuousness :
Suppose an al Qaeda cell in New York , Chicago or Los Angeles was planning a second attack using small arms , conventional explosives or even biological , chemical or nuclear weapons .
Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies faced a near impossible task locating them .
Now suppose the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , which collects signals intelligence , threw up a virtual net to intercept all electronic communications leaving and entering Osama bin Laden ’s Afghanistan headquarters .
What better way of detecting follow - up attacks ?
And what president — of either political party — would n’t immediately order the NSA to start , so as to find and stop the attackers ?
Evidently , none of the inspectors general of the five leading national security agencies would approve .
Those inspectors general , in Yoo ’s imagination , are n’t overworked bureaucrats in wrinkle - free shirts , cotton Dockers and overgrown haircuts , buried under endless reams of paper .
They ’re useful idiots for Osama bin Laden .
In truth , the reason why the inspectors general do n’t entertain that scenario is because it ’s absurd .
If the intelligence community knew what the “ electronic communications ” signatures heading into and out of Osama bin Laden ’s Afghanistan headquarters were , they could very easily obtain warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 , because they ’d possess individualized suspicion .
This is an unproblematic case , fitting easily under the aegis of the law on Sept. 12 , 2001 .
It has absolutely nothing to do with what the inspectors general call the “ President ’s Surveillance Program . ”
That ’s also why the battery of Justice Department leaders like Acting Attorney General Jim Comey , Associate Attorney General Jack Goldsmith , FBI Director Robert Mueller and Associate Deputy Attorney General Patrick Philbin fought to rein in the surveillance activities — because they were overbroad and outside of FISA , which Congress explicitly made the “ exclusive means ” for conducting legal foreign surveillance .
Yoo continues :
It is absurd to think that a law like FISA should restrict live military operations against potential attacks on the United States .
Actually , it ’s absurd to think that a law like FISA does .
Yoo cites the 9/11 Commission , saying it found that “ FISA ’s wall between domestic law enforcement and foreign intelligence ” proved to be such a hindrance , but that ’s a misrepresentation .
FISA has no such wall .
The “ wall ” was an invention of the Justice Department under Janet Reno to separate foreign - collected surveillance from criminal investigations , nothing even close to “ live military operations , ” and in practice that bureaucratic restriction went too far and inhibited necessary FBI - CIA collaboration .
The Bush administration ’s response was n’t to get Congress to change FISA ; it was to entirely circumvent it .
Clearly , the five inspectors general were responding to the media - stoked politics of recrimination , not consulting the long history of American presidents who have lived up to their duty in times of crisis .
More than a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt authorized the FBI to intercept any communications , domestic or international , of persons “ suspected of subversive activities . . . including suspected spies . ”
You know what law , passed in 1978 , did n’t exist when FDR was president ?
Yoo goes even further , and takes selective quotations from Jefferson and Hamilton to suggest that his long - discredited theory that presidents have king - like powers during times of war , and yet he never comes out and says it , because even in The Wall Street Journal people can recognize absurdity .
What ’s amazing about Yoo ’s caustic attack on the inspectors general report is that the report itself embarrasses
Yoo but does little else .
There ’s no suggestion of prosecution , no recommendation of additional investigation , no harsh language .
It says simply that Yoo says what he says in this op - ed and that his superiors at OLC were cut out of that loop .
That ’s all .
Yoo ’s not even in danger , if reports about Attorney General Eric Holder ’s potential new investigation are to be believed , of moving into the crosshairs of the Justice Department .
Today ’s attack on the inspectors general is Yoo ’s response to having his own words quoted back at him .
Which , perhaps , is insult enough .
It ’s like seeing the next 30 years of your life unfold before your horrified eyes .

Local concerns about the safety of carbon sequestration are blocking European power giant Vattenfall ’s plan to close the loop on greenhouse gas emissions from its coal - fired carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) pilot plant in Schwarze Pumpe , Germany .
The ‘ oxyfuel ’ plant has been burning coal in pure oxygen since starting up last fall , making its CO2 exhaust easy to capture .
But burial of the CO2 , set to begin this spring , is now on hold according to the U.K. ’s Guardian newspaper .
Staffan Gortz , Vattenfall ’s CCS spokesperson , told the paper that , “ people are very , very skeptical . ”
This is a point I ’ve been stressing of late .
My feature story Germany ’s Green Energy Gap in the July issue of Spectrum ends with the anxieties of Brunsbüttel resident Stephan Klose , who raises the specter of sequestered CO2 from coal plants escaping to the surface and causing mass asphyxiation .
“ If there ’s a leak and you have a 1 - to 2 - meter - high level of CO2 , every animal , every human being within this zone will die , ” says Klose .
And my Data page
Where Europe Buries Carbon in this month ’s issue of Spectrum highlights both the extent of the European Union ’s carbon capture plans and the public acceptance challenge they face .
“ The EU must … convince a wary public that buried CO2 will stay buried for good , protecting the densely populated communities above it , ” is how we put it .
But a mea culpa is in order : I underestimated the vehemency and immediacy of those concerns .
The Data page shows Vattenfall ’s chosen sequestration site in central Germany as green or “ operating ” .
Alas even this relatively small - scale CO2 injection — over an order of magnitude smaller than the CO2 volume that a full - scale coal power plant generates — appears to be on hold until at least next spring .

Right now many of us are felling just plain tapped out .
Dealing with working from home and managing children during the pandemic does n't leave a lot of time for taking care of ourselves .
But we should , and there are some easy , healthy fixes right at your fingertips – in the fridge .
The first is former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara's , In Retrospect : The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam .
It was published in 1995 , nearly 30 years after he left the Defense Department in 1968 , but received much attention when McNamara died , at 93 , in early July .
As is well known , McNamara was a part of a World War II " systems analysis " team at Defense , led by Tex Thornton , a " whiz kid " who rose to the top of Ford Motor and a civilian technocrat who brought a powerful systems orientation to the Pentagon in the early 60s .
While this approach certainly had relevant application to an attempt to rationalize the Pentagon 's corpulent competition between the Army , Navy and Air Force , it became famous in the Vietnam War when numbers like body counts , targets hit , enemy forces captured , weapons seized , tons of bombs dropped , and hamlets protected were used to argue that the war was being prosecuted successfully .
The origins of the war were not in systems theories ( rather , to take one strand , a belief that monolithic Russian - Chinese Communism would overrun Southeast Asia ) .
But those theories played an important part in convincing McNamara and President Johnson that the war could be won and , therefore , in deepening our involvement , resulting in tragedy both for the U.S. and for Vietnam
Thirty years later , McNamara declared in his book ( positions repeated later in the award winning documentary , " Fog of War " ) that , although his aspirations were idealistic , " we were wrong .
We were terribly wrong . "
Among his " lessons " about the causes of the Vietnam mistake : " our profound ignorance of the history , culture and politics of the people ...[ the failure ] to recognize the limitations of modern high technology military equipment . "
After McNamara 's death , the historian Michael Beschloss wrote : " McNamara knew little about Southeast Asia , and made no conspicuous effort to learn more .
His penchant for numbers left him ill - equipped to understand that some human motivations cannot be quantified or predicted .
As a result , he drastically underestimated the Viet Cong 's determination . "
The second book , Gillian Tett 's Fool 's Gold , is a detailed account of how a small group of bankers at J.P. Morgan in the mid-90s ( many with degrees in math and computer science ) developed product models -- credit derivatives -- and perfected methods of breaking those derivative products into small pieces , bundling the pieces and selling them -- securitization .
Tett is a well - regarded reporter at The Financial Times , covering global markets .
And , while there have already been many important books written on the financial crash ( one of the first being Charles S. Morris ' The Trillion Dollar Meltdown ) , this is a very fine - grained account of what actually happened inside major institutions .
As she explains in detail , the purpose behind credit derivatives was for Bank A to sell some its loan risk to Bank B .
Then , when the underlying loans and the credit derivatives were bundled together and sold off to many other investors , the creators , relying on mathematical models , felt that they had eliminated financial risk .
A cult followed , as other financial institutions like Bear Stearn , Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch and AIG used the Morgan technique and added the combustible element of subprime loans to the derivative and securitization approach .
Apple on Monday released Safari 4 , the next version of its Web browser for OS X and Windows users .
The updated browser will also ship with Snow Leopard once the planned OS X 10.6 update arrives in September .
Safari 4 has been available as a public beta since February , when Apple unveiled the new version of the browser .
The new version features the Nitro Javascript engine , which is aimed at improving Safari ’s speed .
During Monday ’s WWDC keynote , Bertrand Serlet , Apple ’s senior vice president of software engineering , touted the speed improvements to Safari , claiming the updated browser can execute JavaScript nearly eight times faster than Internet Explorer 8 and more than four times faster than Firefox 3 .
Safari 4 can also load eight pages three times faster than IE and Firefox , according to Apple ’s figures .
Safari 4 will run as a 64 - bit application in the forthcoming Snow Leopard update .
That will further boost the performance of the Nitro JavaScript engine .
Also in Snow Leopard , Safari 4 will offer a a crash - resistance feature by running plugins as a separate process .
The leading cause of crashes in OS X comes from browser plug-ins , Apple says ; in the new version of Safari , if a plugin crashes , only that part of the page will be broken , while the browser will remain open .
Other improvements in Safari 4 include a Top Sites feature that gave users a visual preview of frequently visited pages ; Full History Search for finding titles , Web address , and text of recently viewed pages ; and a Cover Flow view for browsing bookmarks .
Safari 4
Beta ’s tabs - on - top feature , where Web page tabs were located at the very top of the window , is gone in the final release .
Instead , tabs have returned to where they were in Safari 3 , immediately below the bookmarks bar .
The new version of Safari includes HTML 5 support for offline technologies as well as support for advanced CSS Effects .
According to Apple , Safari 4 is the first browser to pass the Web Standards Project ’s Acid3 test , which looks at how well a browser adheres to CSS , JavaScript , XML , and SVG standards designed specifically for dynamic Web applications .
Safari runs on Mac OS X 10.4.11 or later and requires Security Update 2009 - 002 .
Apple says Safari 4 is available for download at its Web site .
Updated at 11:25 a.m. PT to include more information on the Safari 4 update .
Updated at 12:58 p.m. PT to note the removal of the Tabs on Top feature .

欧米では思春期に入ると矯正治療を行うのが当たり前ですが、日本ではまだまだ矯正治療をしている子供の数は少ない方です。独特なブラケットとワイヤーをつけているだけで友達からからかわれるという意見が多く、矯正治療に踏み切れない子供が多いからです。見た目を気にするなら、見た目が一切気にならないインビザラインが一番です。透明のマウスピース型の矯正器具なので、矯正していることは友達にも一切ばれることなく普段通りの学校生活を送るだけで大丈夫です。そして、歯磨きも大変楽ですので、虫歯ができるリスクも相当抑えることができます。まさに矯正治療を迷っている子供に適した治療法です。インビザラインでの治療を受けると決めたら、矯正専門の歯科医で受けるとより確かに歯を綺麗に整えていくことができます。是非親子で話し合うことです。
歯の矯正にはインビザラインで
食生活の変化から、歯並びの悪い人が多くみかけられるようになりました。固いものを食べず、柔らかいものを多く摂取することで、見られうる現象と言われます。ですが大人になってから、非常に困ることが多くなります。虫歯にはなり易く、特に女性にはホルモンバランスの崩れから、生理不順と言ったことなども起きてしまいます。そのため歯の矯正が行なわれるのですが、今まではワイヤー治療のブラケットタイプと言われるものでした。見た目も良くなく、不便さが目立つものでした。そんな不便さを解消した矯正器具が、インビザラインと言われるものになります。マウスピース型になっており、取り外しも可能になっています。以前は価格も高額でしたが、普及に伴い料金も安価になって来ています。これからの時代、歯の矯正はこのインビザラインが主流になるのでしょう。
金属アレルギーの方に良いインビザライン
歯並びや出っ歯を綺麗に治したいけど、金属アレルギーのため矯正治療ができなくて困っている人は割とたくさんいます。治療が終わるまでの約数年間金属製のブラケットやワイヤーを付けた状態ですので、口内の健康状態が心配になります。金属アレルギーが気になって、今まで矯正治療に踏み切ることができなかった人でも、安心して治療ができる方法があります。インビザラインと呼ばれる透明のマウスピース型の矯正です。素材もプラスティックでできているため金属アレルギーで悩んでる人でも矯正治療を開始することができます。ワイヤータイプの矯正と同じくらいの効力を発揮するので、問題なく綺麗な歯並びを手に入れることができます。インビザラインのおかげで、金属アレルギーの人も、口内環境を気にすることなく矯正ができるので、迷いなく治療をしてほしいです。
( CNN ) -- China has launched an organ donation system that it hopes will eliminate illegal organ trading and encourage people to become donors , according to reports in China 's state - run media .
China 's Deputy Health Minister Huang Jiefu , pictured , says only 10 people in China donated an organ this year .
Health officials will start promoting the system in 10 provinces and cities , including China 's largest city of Shanghai and the prosperous southern region of Guangdong .
Donating organs is not a widespread practice in China .
Officials said last year , only 36 people donated organs -- out of a population of 1.3 billion .
The organ donation program -- which was unveiled on Tuesday -- will be " in line with the national conditions and international ethics , " China 's Deputy Health Minister Huang Jiefu said , according to Xinhua News Agency .
China has long relied on executed prisoners as its main source of organs for those in need of transplants , drawing widespread condemnation from international human rights groups .
That system failed to address the needs of the more than 1.5 million people in China who are in need of an organ transplant , according to the Chinese Medical Association 's deputy director for transplanting .
" The huge shortage of organ donors and organs has created a significant black market for organs , which in turn has ruined public faith and willingness to donate organs , " Chen Zhonghua told China 's Global Times newspaper .
" There are already signs of backlash , with the nationwide number [ of donations ] falling last year to 36 , from 41 the previous year , and only about 10 cases so far this year . "
Only 11,000 transplant operations -- from both living and deceased donors -- are performed each year , according to Chen .
More than 90 percent of those organs come from executed prisoners , according to the United Nations ' World Health Organization .
In 2007 , China introduced new regulations which banned organ trading and trafficking , and cracked down on " transplant tourism " by non-Chinese nationals .
W.H.O. praised the new regulations in a report released in December .
W.H.O. said China has also made an effort to ensure that " altruism , " and not financial compensation , is " the driving principle " for organ donors .
China 's new regulations " have successfully established baseline requirements for medical institutions to do transplantations , " W.H.O. said .
The reforms have also led to a significant decrease in the number of organ transplants from cadavers , it added .
According to the W.H.O. , " the number of living - related organ transplants [ increased ] by more than 100 percent in China in 2007 . "
Chen and other Chinese health officials hope the new organ donation system will help increase the number of organ donors , which is about 0.03 donors per 1 million people .
Only 130 organ transplants have ever been performed in China using donors who consented to have their organs used after their death , Chen said .
He conceded that it will be a massive task to get China 's organ donation program in line with other countries , such as Spain , which has 34 deceased donors per million -- the world 's highest rate .
" It will take China five to 10 years to raise the number to 0.3 in 1 million people , " Chen estimated .

In an April speech to the Economic Club of New York , the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , Sheila Bair , took a stand on one of today ’s most pressing economic questions .
The idea that certain financial firms were “ too big to fail , ” she said , should be “ tossed in the dustbin . ”
Congress should pay attention .
Since the early 1980s , Washington has increasingly refused to let the largest or most complex financial institutions — the expression “ too big to fail ” includes both — go under in a predictable manner .
Instead , it has taken extraordinary actions to rescue and protect them , lest their failure inflict broader harm on the economy .
By sheltering the lenders to these firms from market discipline , it has encouraged the financial industry and its consumers ’ debt load to grow to unsustainable size .
Yet even after the Wall Street collapse , the Obama administration , far from following Bair ’s advice , is pushing the “ too big to fail ” policy even further .
This course will exact a terrible cost .
For our economy to thrive , “ too big to fail ” must die .
Until the early 1980s , it was generally assumed that failure was a possibility for financial institutions , along with losses for investors who lent to them or held shares in them .
Sensible regulation underpinned the assumption .
Back in the mid-1930s , the trough of the Great Depression , the federal government created a way for commercial banks to go under without catastrophically damaging the broader economy — as had happened earlier in the decade , when customers , panicked about banks ’ health , rushed to withdraw their money , making lending dry up completely .
The feds ’ instrument was the very institution that Bair now heads : the FDIC , a government - chartered body that insured small depositors ’ funds so that they would n’t panic .
With mom-and - pop depositors protected , the FDIC could then take over failed banks and wind them down in a predictable way , ensuring that shareholders and uninsured lenders — that is , depositors whose accounts exceeded FDIC limits , as well as bondholders — took their lumps .
( The FDIC covered only commercial banks — the storehouses of the economy ’s vital money and credit supplies — not investment banks , which failed through the normal bankruptcy process . )
Fifty years of policy died in 1984 .
That May , the nation ’s eighth - largest commercial bank , Chicago ’s Continental Illinois , found itself in deep trouble .
Like any enterprising company in a capitalist society , it had exercised its right to establish a competitive edge and pursue greater profits — with a corresponding risk of failure , which had now struck .
Continental ’s biggest error was how it paid for its investments .
All banks use depositors ’ money and other sources of funding to make loans and other investments .
But beyond using funds from FDIC - insured small depositors and other stable , long - term lenders ( such as bondholders ) , Continental relied more than most banks on short - term , uninsured lenders from around the globe , particularly large depositors .
Global corporations and other investors often park their money overnight or for a few weeks at a time in bank accounts that offer slightly higher rates because , once they ’ve exceeded the FDIC limits , they carry risk .
For a lender who does n’t mind that risk , these short - term , uninsured accounts are attractive , since he can pull his money at any time if he needs cash , finds a better rate elsewhere , or perceives a new danger .
For the borrower , like Continental , however , that ease of withdrawal made the funding source perilous .
A sudden panic could leave the accounts depleted and the bank without money just when it needed it most .
Continental ’s reliance on uninsured short - term lenders was especially negligent because it had invested heavily and unwisely in speculative loans , meaning that a drop in its lenders ’ confidence was almost inevitable .
Only long - term lenders or guaranteed depositors , who would n’t yank their money out immediately in a crisis , could insulate the bank in such a situation .
As soon as rumors swirled that Continental ’s investments were going bad , the short - term global lenders predictably pulled their funds .
Fear of Continental ’s books then metastasized into worldwide fear of all American banks ’ books .
The reason : many of those banks had also started to rely on uninsured short - term lenders for funds , and the lenders often did n’t make distinctions among individual banks .
After taking some modest and ultimately unsuccessful steps to calm the panic , the U.S. government did something radical .
The Federal Reserve and the FDIC , in a “ race to save Continental and thereby sustain confidence in the nation ’s banking system , ” the New York Times reported , pledged that no uninsured depositor or other lender , including bondholders , would lose money should the bank collapse .
In July , to avoid “ a major financial crisis , ” as the Times put it , the Reagan administration outright nationalized the hobbled bank , with the FDIC taking 80 percent ownership and responsibility for its bad loans .
The era of “ too big to fail ” had begun .
The break from normal practice divided the administration .
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan found the intervention outrageous : “ We believe it is bad public policy , would be seen to be unfair . . . and represents an unauthorized and unlegislated expansion of federal guarantees in contravention of executive branch policy , ” he wrote to his colleagues .
But the White House , by offering its quiet support to the Fed and the FDIC , plainly agreed with their compelling argument that the alternative was to risk a systemic crisis in the financial industry .
Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker told Congress that the decision to protect uninsured lenders of a private institution from the consequences of a freely assumed risk was n’t meant to set a precedent .
But the federal comptroller of the currency , which regulates banks , made clear that a shift in policy had taken place , telling Congress that none of the nation ’s top 11 banks would be allowed to fail .
Small banks were apoplectic .
Jokes flourished about investors ’ not wanting to put money into the nation ’s 12th - largest bank .
“ How often and to what extent can the government , and in turn the taxpayers , prop up any institutions that are neither the nation ’s best or brightest ? ” wondered the Independent Bankers Association of America .
The “ too big to fail ” principle persisted during the savings - and - loan crisis of the late eighties and early nineties , when Washington saved uninsured lenders to big banks wherever it saw a risk to the broader system , letting uninsured lenders to smaller banks languish .
In the summer of 1991 , Fed chairman Alan Greenspan — just a few years after saying ( as a libertarian private - sector economist at the time ) that he was n’t even “ a great fan of deposit insurance ” — reminded lawmakers of the post - Continental stance that “ there may be some banks , at some particular times , whose collapse and liquidation would be excessively disruptive . ”
Gradually , lenders to big banks understood that their money was no longer at risk .
And the banks realized that the bigger and more complicated they got , the safer they would be from market discipline — and so they became .
Of course , the financial industry changed in response to many other forces , too , including shifting market demand , global competition , and increasing investment in the stock market .
But we ’ll never know exactly how great a role government protection played in driving finance ’s transformation , since government subsidies — and that ’s what “ too big to fail ” amounts to — always distort the valuable information that markets provide .
Nearly a decade and a half after the government rescued Continental Illinois , “ too big to fail ” expanded beyond commercial banks to other parts of the financial world .
The catalyst : the 1998 collapse of a small Connecticut hedge fund , Long - Term Capital Management .
Long - Term , a money manager for wealthy investors , used exotic , often unregulated , financial instruments called derivatives to bet on the up - and - down movement of certain securities and financial markets .
In the summer of 1998 , after four years of good profits , the firm miscalculated badly .
Like Continental , it had exercised its American right to take risks — and it screwed up .
It could n’t afford to .
Long - Term had made $ 125 billion in investments , even though its own shareholders had given it only $ 2.3 billion .
It had borrowed the rest — $ 53 for every dollar it had in hand .
But that was n’t all : through its derivatives , Long - Term magnified its potential obligations to a scarcely conceivable $ 1.25 trillion .
There would be no way for the hedge fund to pay its debts should anything go wrong , and now it had .
“ Too big to fail ” played a key role in bringing the crisis about .
The source of Long - Term ’s breathtaking borrowing was none other than the big banks , both commercial and investment .
Lenders to the commercial banks had known that the government implicitly protected them , and thus did n’t worry much about what the banks were doing with their money , including extending so much credit to the hedge fund .
The investment banks had to keep up with the commercial banks as competition intensified and their profit margins shrank , so they had poured their money into Long - Term , too .
Long - Term ’s pending collapse represented a huge risk to the rest of the financial world — an even greater risk than Continental ’s had — and an incalculable one .
Nobody knew which of the world ’s banks , brokerage firms , and hedge funds might be left owing or might be owed billions of dollars if Long - Term declared bankruptcy .
And this opacity of exposure was n’t Long - Term ’s only threat to the financial system .
The firm ’s enablers had lent it money on a short - term , often overnight , basis .
The collateral for the loans was Long - Term ’s various investments , meaning that in a default , the lenders could swoop in , seize the collateral , and dump it into the global markets .
This forced selling would instantly drive down the price of everything from junk bonds to mortgage securities , causing problems for other firms that had borrowed against similar collateral — and for the broader economy .
Long - Term could n’t fail , then , regulators determined .
Under the New York Fed ’s supervision , the banks and investment firms that had lent the fund enough money to push the financial world to the precipice now pulled the company back .
They infused $ 3.6 billion into Long - Term and took 90 percent ownership .
Lenders to Long - Term lost nothing .
Now , lenders to all complex financial firms enjoyed the same implicit protection from normal failure mechanisms that the biggest commercial banks had .
The new precedent was stunning .
Scarcely a half - decade earlier , Greenspan had said he could n’t imagine that the U.S. government would ever bail out a securities firm .
In 1990 , a prominent American investment firm , Drexel Burnham Lambert , had declared bankruptcy and the financial world survived ; in 1995 , just three years before the Long - Term rescue , a large British - based investment bank , Barings , had gone bankrupt , also with no horrific repercussions .
But since then , the financial world , through the expansion of unregulated derivatives , had become more complex and thus vulnerable to contagion from one firm ’s failure , putting the economy at risk , too .
As the dust settled from the Long - Term debacle , Washington tried to backtrack , pointing out that no taxpayer money had been used in the bailout .
But Greenspan ’s public statements and his rattled demeanor during and after the crisis made clear that the Fed would have used government funds if the banks had refused to help .
Uninsured lenders everywhere recognized that if the government protected lenders to a hedge fund , then it certainly would n’t let an investment bank collapse .
Lenders ’ critical role in disciplining the financial system — by refusing to lend to overly risky institutions — was gone .
From that absence sprang the current financial crisis .
Lenders had every reason to lend freely and carelessly to financial firms ’ , letting them pile up cheap debt — which they did , leaving themselves little room for error if even a few of the investments that they supported with the debt went sour .
In turn , the firms lent too much to American consumers .
Between 1980 and 2008 , total debt in the economy more than doubled as a percentage of gross domestic product .
Massive amounts of cheap debt helped create the asset bubble that burst , starting in 2006 , and took the global economy with it .
By the time the crisis intensified in 2008 with the foundering of Bear Stearns , Citigroup , and AIG , the government ’s rescue of these too - big - to - fail firms was n’t surprising .
True , the feds declined to bail out Lehman Brothers , letting its lenders take losses .
But the panic after Lehman ’s bankruptcy seems to have convinced officials that permitting losses was a mistake .
By the end of last year , the government , through a “ temporary ” new FDIC program , was offering to guarantee virtually all new lending to banks .
In every one of these cases — Continental , the savings and loans , Long - Term , the current crisis — the government ’s immediate response was understandable .
If it had permitted disorderly failure in either 1984 or 1998 , the short - term consequences would have been dire , bringing the risk of a deep recession as financial firms and instruments failed and survivors tightened lending .
Similarly , it was economically impossible for President George W. Bush to force lenders to Bear Stearns , Citigroup , and AIG to take losses when there was no consistent , orderly process through which they could do so without risk to the economy .
Uninsured depositors and other lenders had come to expect bailouts over the decades and had acted accordingly , running risks that left themselves , and the economy , vulnerable to systemic catastrophe .
A sudden shutdown of an inadequately regulated financial industry could have resulted in a depression .
What ’s unforgivable is the government ’s response after each crisis .
After their ad hoc rescue of Continental Illinois , regulators and elected officials should have presented it to the public as harsh evidence that the old regulations to wind down bad financial institutions had stopped working , necessitating credible new ones that would let uninsured lenders to banks know that they risked warranted losses .
Such enforcement of market discipline might have prevented Long - Term Capital Management from happening 14 years later .
After it did happen , the government , once again , should have instituted regulations to protect the economy from both disorderly failures and exploding financial instruments .
Instead , we have had two and a half decades of punting on the key regulatory questions .
Today , after the most recent and destructive round of explosions , the government ’s response threatens to be more of the same .
The Obama administration claims that it wants to create a way for bad financial firms to fail .
Yet in its June financial - regulatory proposal , it formalizes “ too big to fail , ” giving the Treasury new power to “ stabilize a failing institution . . . by providing loans to the firm , purchasing assets from the firm , guaranteeing the liabilities of the firm , or making equity investments in the firm . ”
The proposal says nothing about making sure that bondholders and other uninsured lenders take losses .
Reintroducing a predictable , credible way for lenders to financial firms to take losses when failure strikes would go a long way toward protecting the economy from speculative excesses .
Market forces , coupled with overdue new rules for inadequately regulated financial instruments , would have a better chance of reducing reckless risk - taking before it got out of control .
As a first step , the government should create an FDIC - style conservatorship for failed big or complex financial institutions .
A new kind of bankruptcy could come into play in such a process , says University of Texas business - law professor Jay Westbrook .
It might keep some lenders ( and trading partners on derivatives ) from seizing their collateral immediately and selling it .
This would reduce the possibility that instant sales of billions of dollars ’ worth of securities would destabilize the financial system .
In another elaboration of the conservatorship idea , economists R. Glenn Hubbard , Hal Scott , and Luigi Zingales have proposed an elegant FDIC - managed system that would begin by splitting failed financial firms in two .
One new entity would take over the toxic assets that caused the firm ’s problems .
This “ bad bank ” would also bring the failed firm ’s lenders with it , and the lenders would take losses based on the collapsed value of the assets .
The other new entity , no longer weighed down by the bad assets , could meet the original firm ’s remaining obligations and raise new funds .
It could then free itself from government administration , as in any corporate exit from bankruptcy .
Lenders to the original failed firm , now lenders to the bad bank , would receive stock in the restructured firm , sharing in its future profits , just as lenders to an ordinary bankrupt firm can .
However the arcane details take shape , the key factor in imposing market discipline on the financial world is credibility .
Lenders to big banks and other financial firms must be made to worry that their money really is potentially at risk — that the feds wo n’t keep stepping in to save them .
If credibility is n’t soon established , Washington ’s actions will have created a monster , stoking more reckless debt creation at a time when debt has already reached a staggering and record 350 percent of GDP .
Witness how quickly banks were able to borrow money earlier this year from private lenders — sometimes without the FDIC ’s new emergency guarantee .
The government heralded the loans as evidence that lenders were regaining confidence in the financial sector .
They were n’t .
Lenders merely had confidence that Washington would stick to its policy of bailouts for tottering financial companies .
Too big to fail ” imperils the economy ’s long - term health in other ways .
If big or complex financial firms keep their state subsidy , they ’ll continue to divert lenders ’ money away from other , perhaps more deserving , industries .
Why lend money to Cisco when you can lend it to Citigroup risk - free ?
Further , failure is necessary in a free market , since it improves economic efficiency .
When a company fails , a more successful firm can buy its good assets , releasing them from incompetent management .
Failed firms ’ workers can likewise find more useful outlets for their labor .
Even people who made the mistakes that led to a firm ’s failure can start anew .
Vitally for the economy , failure helps ensure that bad ideas die , so that government and private resources are n’t wasted on a business model that does n’t work .
If real reform does n’t happen , get ready for a fearsome certainty : that markets will eventually correct our unsustainable financial system .
They have tried to do so several times over the decades by punishing firms like Continental , Long - Term , and , most recently , Citigroup , as well as the lenders who financed them .
The government thwarted these necessary corrections at every turn , bailing out the reckless and their enablers .
But the price of maintaining our untenable system keeps growing , and eventually the government wo n’t be able to pay the bill .
The multitrillion - dollar price tag attached to the government ’s current endeavors already endangers the nation ’s fiscal health .
A decade from now , failing financial firms could take the credit of the U.S. government right down with them .
It looks as if Sony is getting more aggressive not just with pricing and marketing , but in keeping strong relationships with 3rd party developers .
In a strange and surprising move , CodeMasters announced that Sony Computer Entertainment will be taking over sales and distribution duties for the upcoming Colin McRae : Dirt 2 on both PS3 and PSP .
Similar to Sony ’s move to capture the publishing rights forAtari ’s Ghostbusters earlier this year , the deal will cover the SCEE PAL regions ( except Spain , Australia and New Zealand ) , however , unlike Ghostbusters , Dirt 2 will not be a timed PlayStation exclusive and will still be released on Xbox 360 , Wii and DS , alongside its PlayStation counterparts , on September 11th .
Codemasters ’ senior VP of publishing for EPAC Axel Herr explained the company ’s decision :
“ To have Colin McRae : Dirt 2 represented by the platform holder during the new PS3 system ’s launch window is testimony to the strength of the game and its commercial relevance ,
“ The Colin McRae series has enjoyed a great affinity with the PlayStation brand in PAL territories for over 10 years and we ’re proud to have the support and ambition of SCEE behind it during this key time for both the PS3 and PSP . ”
While this may seem an odd move by Sony , with there being no apparent exclusive bonuses for their systems , it will certainly be good news for the UK publisher .
CodeMasters is set to benefit from the increased publishing support , as well as significant media attention .

What you are about to read is from an actual court filing .
Gregory McKenna has filed suit against Apple , which he alleges is conspiring with the mob in an effort to coerce him to return to a New York - based modeling agency he quit in 2000 .
As explained in the 124 - page complaint , an iPod shuffle he bought on eBay in 2005 and an iPod mini he bought new from an Apple store in 2006 -- possibly a nano , as minis were discontinued a year prior -- both contain receivers that have allowed the Mafia to send audio death threats that play in tandem with his music .
The suit seeks $ 14.3 million total and lists ten defendants in all , including a local mechanic , a private investigator , the St. Louis Police Department , the FBI , and the US Department of Justice .
While our initial reaction is to laugh at the ridiculousness of it all , it 's hard not to feel sad for McKenna and his state of mind -- of course , if by some stroke of fate he manages to prove it was all one big conspiracy perpetrated by the Mafia , well , guess we 'll be ending up with egg on our faces .

The NSW Director of Public Prosecutions has slammed the Federal Government 's internet censorship policy , saying it will have very limited , if any , success in achieving its aims .
Nicholas Cowdery , QC , made the comments in response to a question from a journalist at a conference on e-crime in Sydney yesterday .

" Crime prevention methods need to be practical ...

A lot of terms are flying in the debate over what shape healthcare reform should take in the U.S.
Ask two people to tell you how it should be approached , and you ’ll get six answers .
But at this stage in the process , it ’s important to put all ideas on the table .
With that in mind , we present three viewpoints on what a new system should -- and should n’t -- look like .
--
Here ’s a way for America to cut its spiraling healthcare costs : ice floes .
This idea is n’t mine .
It ’s President Obama’s .
Or rather , it ’s where we ’re likely to end up if the president prevails on Congress to pass the adventurous healthcare reform proposal currently being discussed , which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will cost about $ 1 trillion over the next 10 years .
That ’s on top of Medicare ’s annual $ 327 - billion budget , whose massive deficits , if they continue at the same rate , are predicted to bankrupt the Medicare system by the end of the next decade .

In looking for a way to fund healthcare , Obama has set his eye on the oldest and sickest .
You see , according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , about 30 % of Medicare spending -- nearly $ 100 billion annually -- goes to care for patients during their last year of life .
What if there were no “ last year of life , ” the president seems to be asking .
The Eskimos used to set their elderly and sickly adrift on the ice or otherwise abandon them during times of scarcity , and that , metaphorically speaking , is what Obama would like us all to start doing .
The scarcity of resources to pay for expensive medical procedures will only increase under a plan to extend medical benefits at federal expense to the 47 million Americans who lack health insurance .
So why not save billions of dollars by killing off our own unproductive oldsters and terminal patients , or -- since we are n’t likely to do that outright in this , the 21st century -- why not simply ensure that they die faster by denying them costly medical care ?
The savings could then subsidize care for the younger and healthier .
Sound too draconian ?
Enter the ghost of Obama ’s late maternal grandmother , Madelyn Dunham , who died of cancer at age 86 two days before her grandson ’s election to the presidency .
Dunham ’s health issues first surfaced in a New York Times interview with the president on May 3 .
There , Obama questioned the appropriateness of a hip replacement that his grandmother had undergone after falling and breaking her hip shortly after being diagnosed with terminal cancer last year .
The alternative to such surgery is typically excruciating pain and opiate dependency .
Obama made it clear that he loved his granny and would have paid for the surgery out of his own pocket if he had to , but he said there ought to be a “ conversation ” over whether “ sort of in the aggregate , society making those decisions to give my grandmother , or everybody else ’s aging grandparents or parents , a hip replacement when they ’re terminally ill is a sustainable model . ”
Obama suggested that such decisions be made not by patients or their relatives but by a “ group ” of “ doctors , scientists , ethicists ” who are not part of “ normal political channels . ”
Obama brought up his grandmother ’s hip replacement a second time in his June 24 town hall event on healthcare on ABC .
The “ question was , ” Obama said , “ does she get hip - replacement surgery , even though she was fragile enough they were not sure how long she would last ? ”
At that point I was thinking :
If he says , “ No hip replacement for you , Grams ” one more time , it ’s going to be a drinking game .

An audience member , Jane Sturm , told the story of her 99 - year - old mother , who had initially been turned down for a pacemaker on account of her age .
Sturm ’s mother persuaded a second physician impressed with her joie de vivre to perform the life - extending operation -- and she ’s still hale today at age 105 .
“ Outside the medical criteria , ” Sturm asked , “ is there a consideration that can be given for a certain spirit ... and quality of life ? ”
Nope .
“ I do n’t think that we can make judgments based on people ’s spirit , ” Obama said .
“ That would be a pretty subjective decision to be making .
I think we have to have rules that we are going to provide good , quality care for all people . ”
If that sounds cold , or like an interference with the traditional physician - patient relationship , in which doctors make decisions -- call them “ subjective ” decisions , if you like -- about the most appropriate care for their patients on an individual basis , that is the very point .
Obama and those who support his healthcare reform proposals have embraced a concept called “ comparative effectiveness research . ”
The idea behind comparative effectiveness research is basically a good one :
Use large - scale scientific studies to determine which medical procedures produce the best patient outcomes in the aggregate , and whether some expensive tests , drugs and surgeries might not be as effective in the aggregate as cheaper alternatives .
Such information -- sometimes called “ evidence - based medicine ” -- can be helpful to doctors in deciding what treatments would be best for their patients and maybe save them some money .
But Obama and his healthcare supporters do not want to stop there .
Their implicit proposal seems to want to turn comparative effectiveness research into the “ rules ” that Obama was talking about on ABC : one - size - fits - all procedures that physicians would have to follow at the risk of not being paid by the government .
And the government would increasingly be the payer if Obama ’s proposed “ public option ” health insurance crowds out , as it inevitably will , private health insurers forced to compete with a tax - subsidized government entity .
A pacemaker for your otherwise tough - as - nails 99 - year - old mother ?
Forget it , Mom , you die .

That ’s what Obama means when he talks about “ difficult decisions at end of life , ” as he did on ABC , or “ reining in costs , ” as he did in his New York Times interview .
Congress has already slipped $ 1.1 billion into the economic stimulus law it passed in February to set up a Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research .
Under Obama ’s healthcare plan , physicians participating in Medicare and Medicaid would be paid extra to turn over their patients ’ medical records to a central federal databank , effectively turning their patients into unwitting research subjects for comparative effectiveness .
Bioethicists are clambering aboard the aged - based rationing bandwagon , including Daniel Callahan , co-founder of the Hastings Center , who published two essays in the New York Times last November proposing “ age cutoffs ” or other “ unpleasant solutions ” to trim Medicare costs .
Some of those solutions are already the order of the day in that single - payer paradise , Britain , whose National Health Service does n’t even provide for annual screening mammograms -- something U.S. physicians strongly recommend to detect and treat breast cancer before it becomes virulent .
The National Health Service allows mammograms only every three years , and then only for women between 50 and 70 .
The service ’s guidelines recognize that risk rises with age , but women over 70 must nevertheless explicitly ask to continue having the triennial scans -- a not - so - subtle way of discouraging the screening .
Britain also set up a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in 1999 , whose bureaucrats assign “ quality - adjusted life years ” in deciding whether it is “ cost effective ” to pay for cancer drugs and other treatments .
They ’re the people who decided that if you ’re going blind in both eyes due to age - related macular degeneration , the government will pay for sight - restoring photodynamic therapy for only one of your eyes .
Now , I ’m well aware that having 47 million people who ca n’t afford medical care is a genuine social problem -- although many of those millions are illegal immigrants , people between jobs and young folks who choose to go insurance - bare .
I ’m also aware that I ca n’t necessarily have everything I want , whether it ’s a dozen pairs of Prada boots or a pacemaker at age 99 .
I know that Medicare is on the greased rails to a train wreck , and not just because of spiraling costs but because doctors are fleeing the system because they ’re sick of below - cost reimbursements and crushing paperwork .
There are ways to solve some of these problems : healthcare tax breaks , malpractice reform that would lower the cost of practicing medicine , efforts to make it easier to get cheap , high - deductible catastrophic coverage , steps to encourage fee - for - service arrangements of the kind that most people have with their dentists .

In short , as someone who ’s not getting any younger , I ’d like to be the one who makes the “ difficult decision ” as to whether I can afford -- and thus really want -- that hip replacement in my extreme old age .
Sorry , President Obama , but I do n’t want “ society " -- that is , government mucky - mucks -- determining that I ’ve got to go sit on an ice floe just because I ’m old and kind of ugly , no matter how many fancy degrees in medicine or bioethics they might have .

34 : Calculate Euler 's totient function phi(m ) : Euler 's so - called totient function phi(m ) is defined as the number of positive integers r ( 1 <= r < m ) that are coprime to m : Example : m = 10 : r = 1,3,7,9 ; thus phi(m ) = 4 : Note the special case : phi(1 ) = 1 :
35 : Determine the prime factors of a given positive integer : Construct a flat list containing the prime factors in ascending order :
36 : Determine the prime factors of a given positive integer :
37 : Calculate Euler 's totient function phi(m ) ( improved ) :
See problem 34 for the definition of Euler 's totient function :
If the list of the prime factors of a number m is known in the form of problem 36 then the function phi(m ) can be efficiently calculated as follows : Let ( ( p1 m1 ) ( p2 m2 ) ( p3 m3 ) ... ) be the list of prime factors ( and their multiplicities ) of a given number m :
Then phi(m ) can be calculated with the following formula :
phi(m ) = ( p1 - 1 ) * p1 ** ( m1 - 1 ) + ( p2 - 1 ) * p2 ** ( m2 - 1 ) + ( p3 - 1 ) * p3 ** ( m3 - 1 ) + ...
Note that a ** b stands for the b'th power of a : Note : Actually , the official problems show this as a sum , but it should be a product :
38 : Compare the two methods of calculating Euler 's totient function :
39 : A list of prime numbers :
40 : Goldbach 's conjecture : Goldbach 's conjecture says that every positive even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers : Example : 28 = 5 + 23 : It is one of the most famous facts in number theory that has not been proved to be correct in the general case :
It has been numerically confirmed up to very large numbers ( much larger than w e can go with our Prolog system ) :
Write a predicate to find the two prime numbers that sum up to a given even integer :
41 : Given a range of integers by its lower and upper limit , print a list of all even numbers and their Goldbach composition :
Problems in Logics and Codes
46 : Define predicates and / 2 , or / 2 , nand / 2 , nor / 2 , xor / 2 , impl / 2 and equ/2 ( for logical equivalence ) which succeed or fail according to the result of their respective operations ; e.g : and ( A , B ) will succeed , if and only if both A and B succeed :
47 : Truth tables for logical expressions ( 2 ) .
Continue problem P46 by defining and / 2 , or / 2 , etc as being operators :
This allows to write the logical expression in the more natural way , as in the example : A and ( A or not B ) : Define operator precedence as usual ; i.e : as in Java :
48 : Truth tables for logical expressions ( 3 ) .
Generalize problem P47 in such a way that the logical expression may contain any number of logical variables : Define table / 2 in a way that table ( List , Expr ) prints the truth table for the expression Expr , which contains the logical variables enumerated in List :
49 : Gray codes .
50 : Huffman codes .

Clearly , MaxN = 2**H - 1 : However , what is the minimum number MinN ?
This question is more difficult :
Try to find a recursive statement and turn it into a function minNodes that returns the minimum number of nodes in a height - balanced binary tree of height H .
61 : Count the leaves of a binary tree
61 : ( A ) Collect the leaves of a binary tree in a list
62 : Collect the internal nodes of a binary tree in a list
An internal node of a binary tree has either one or two non-empty successors :
Write a predicate internals / 2 to collect them in a list .
62 : ( B ) Collect the nodes at a given level in a list A node of a binary tree is at level N if the path from the root to the node has length N - 1 :
The root node is at level 1 : Write a predicate atlevel / 3 to collect all nodes at a given level in a list .

We consider binary trees with nodes that are identified by single lower - case letters , as in the example of problem P67 .
a) Write predicates preorder / 2 and inorder / 2 that construct the preorder and inorder sequence of a given binary tree , respectively :
The results should be atoms , e.g : ' abdecfg ' for the preorder sequence of the example in problem P67 .
b ) Can you use preorder / 2 from problem part a ) in the reverse direction ; i.e : given a preorder sequence , construct a corresponding tree ?
If not , make the necessary arrangements .
c ) If both the preorder sequence and the inorder sequence of the nodes of a binary tree are given , then the tree is determined unambiguously :
Write a predicate pre_in_tree / 3 that does the job :
69 : Dotstring representation of binary trees :
We consider again binary trees with nodes that are identified by single lower - case letters , as in the example of problem P67 : Such a tree can be represented by the preorder sequence of its nodes in which dots (. ) are inserted where an empty subtree ( nil ) is encountered during the tree traversal :
For example , the tree shown in problem P67 is represented as ' abd..e..c.fg ...' :
First , try to establish a syntax ( BNF or syntax diagrams ) and then write a predicate tree_dotstring / 2 which does the conversion in both directions :
Use difference lists .

FOR the first time since the Depression , the American economy has added virtually no jobs in the private sector over a 10 - year period .
The total number of jobs has grown a bit , but that is only because of government hiring .
The accompanying charts show the job performance from July 1999 , when the economy was booming and companies were complaining about how hard it was to find workers , through July of this year , when the economy was mired in the deepest and longest recession since World War II .
For the decade , there was a net gain of 121,000 private sector jobs , according to the survey of employers conducted each month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
In an economy with 109 million such jobs , that indicated an annual growth rate for the 10 years of 0.01 percent .
Until the current downturn , the long - term annual growth rate for private sector jobs had not dipped below 1 percent since the early 1960s .
Most often , the rate was well above that .
As can be seen from the charts , there were some areas of strength in the economy .
Health care jobs continued to grow , particularly jobs that involve caring for the elderly .
Home health care employment rose at an annual rate of 5 percent , a rate that indicates a total gain of more than 60 percent .
On an annual basis , that was twice the overall rate for health care of 2.4 percent a year .
Last week British Cycling published its outline plan for the next four years and nobody could accuse the organisation of lacking in ambition .
Among the goals set were : producing a British winner of the Tour de France within 5 years ; getting a million more people cycling ; boosting its membership to 100,000 ; and going beyond being a sporting body to embrace cycling “ in the broadest sense … under one British Cycling umbrella " .
Oh , and they need to win a load of gold medals in 2012 .
That 's a lot to do in four years and it raises questions about just how you go about winning the Tour from scratch while also ensuring you do n't take your eye off the Olympic ball , then there 's the relationships with Sky , and the other national cycling organisations such as the CTC ..
To get the answers we spoke to Ian Drake , British Cycling CEO , and to representatives of the CTC , Sustrans and Cycling England .
Winning the Tour de France within 5 years
road.cc :
Where is the talent to do this going to come from - no - one doubts that Britain road cycling 's strength in depth at the top level of road cycling is probably at an all time high , but with the best will in the world none of our top rider 's looks like a Tour winner – and these guys do n't just come from nowhere … so what 's the plan ?
Ian Drake :
Our goal is ambitious but achievable , just look where we were as a cycling nation in 1997 .
We have some fantastic British talent emerging from our clubs , the go - ride programme and our talent and academy programmes and it ’s about developing this talent in the right environment .
We are confident that this talent will go on to future Olympic and Tour success now that Team Sky is in place .
It is a bold move but the legacy the excitement of Team Sky will generate is as much about getting kids on the bike as riders on the podium .
road.cc : BC 's statement identifies this as one of its goals and yet Team Sky belongs to Sky rather than British Cycling which suggests a blurring of boundaries that some BC members may find unsettling .
Where does BC end and Sky begin ?
Ian Drake : Team Sky is a professional British road cycling team that will be operated entirely by Sky but managed by Dave Brailsford CBE .
Dave led the Great Britain Cycling Team to success in Beijing 2008 and will continue his work as Performance Director of British Cycling .
Even though there is a clear distinction between Team Sky and British Cycling in business terms , they will share the same performance philosophy and together aim to inspire one million more people to cycle by 2013 .
Our partnership with Sky is about supporting cycling from grass roots to elite level , so this makes total sense .
The relationships with Sky
road.cc : Leading on from the last question , what is the exact nature of the relationship , and given the differences in scale and resources between the two is n't there a danger that Sky could cease its involvement with cycling as quickly as it has taken it up – does BC have a contingency plan for such an event ?
Ian Drake :
The partnership with Sky is unique in the world of sport .
Our vision is their vision and this is the start of a long - term journey to change people 's lives in local communities through cycling .
We have substantial support in place from our funding partnership in UK Sport and Sport England already and Sky 's partnership is entirely complementary to those objectives and outcomes .
Its a long term partnership which I am confident will flourish .
road.cc :
We know this is really a question for Sky , but what 's in it for them ?
Top level continental cycling is on free to view satellite , cable , or online , the Tour is on free to view digital as is the ToB , and track cycling is on the BBC .
Ian Drake :
Sky ’s sponsorship of British Cycling is not about TV rights , it is about promoting cycling from the grass roots to elite level , not the other way round .
It is about inspiring and encouraging people to ride at whatever age or ability they are and whichever kind of riding they enjoy .
Sky want to get more people participating in our sport we have a shared goal to get one million more people cycling by 2013 .
As for broadcasting cycling coverage , Sky offer a wealth of cycling programming spread across a number of channels , such as the Tour de France on Eurosport , World Track events on BBC channels and through interactive , mountain biking and BMX on Extreme or Rush .
There is also strong interest in cycling on Sky Sports News and some cycling programming on Sky Sports .
The relationship with other cycling organizations
" The plan embraces cycling in the broadest sense , from grass roots to the elite level , from track and road to BMX and mountain biking , from leisure to cycling as a form of sustainable transport , under one British Cycling umbrella " .
road.cc :
There is already an umbrella organisation charged with growing the numbers of cyclists in England - Cycling England , is British Cycling seeking to fill a vacancy that does not exist .
Ian Drake : Cycling England uses funding from the Department for Transport to support a range of organisations such as local authorities , towns , cities and British Cycling to deliver activities designed to get more people cycling .
We see our plans as entirely complementary and are in liaison with Cycling England about the Skyride programme .
We are looking forward to engaging with the organisation further as the programme expands and gathers momentum .
road.cc :
There also large , well - funded membership organisations already working in the areas of leisure cycling and cycling as transport , namely the CTC and Sustrans ?
What makes British Cycling think it can do better than organisations already acknowledged to be doing good jobs in their particular fields ?
Ian Drake :
There is a huge latent demand for cycling and we are all working towards the same goal .
As identified through the Sport England Active People survey , over 1.9 million adults who are not currently active say that cycling is the one activity they would like to pursue , so we need to ensure that there are enough appropriate activities delivered by a whole range of partners to make this happen .
British Cycling ’s remit has always been across cycling as a sport and a pastime but it is only now that we are finally resourced to deliver on both .
We are growing faster than any other cycling organisation and we want to use our international success to inspire people to ride their bikes for sport , recreation and travel .
What we are doing is entirely complementary to other organisations and will benefit everyone who wants cycling to do well in this country .
It will also provide British Cycling with the platform to really grow competitive sport at a rate never seen before .
road.cc :
How is British Cycling going to manage its relationships with these organisations ( and others ) so that cycling does n't end up with a situation where all its leading organisations are working at cross purposes , and potentially against each other ?
Ian Drake : I can not see how we will be working at cross purposes when all of us want the best for the sport .
We are very clearly putting in a participation pathway that will lead people to the sport if they want or help them ride their bike for leisure or travel for life .
With so many people out there who want to get involved in cycling , we need a range of diverse programmes and all organisations linked to cycling to help people find a way to our sport .
Membership drive
road.cc :
Is this plan an indication that BC is looking to re-position itself for post 2012 when lottery funding is cut and its current membership base will not be sufficient to sustain the organisation at its current size ?
Ian Drake :
We have grown our membership by over 75 per cent in the last four years and we are currently growing at a rate of 23 per cent per annum .
The bigger we grow , the more we can invest in the people who make cycle sport happen in the UK from our members , event organisers and clubs to volunteers and event officials .
Everyone will benefit as a consequence of our growth , as there will be more opportunities to participate at all levels .
road.cc :
How does BC respond to those , like one of the commenters on our orgingal story , who say that BC should confine itself to looking after cycling as a sport - particularly given that the sporting goals it has set itself are extremely tough ?
Ian Drake : Elite sport and participation go hand in hand and will contribute equally to the growth of cycling .
The next four years are about linking the two activities and replicating our medal success in the context of more people enjoying the sport .
What is driving us is the desire to secure a great future for our sport by linking all the elements that make it happen .
The view from outside …
So how do other national cycling organisations view British Cycling 's new outline plan ?
Cycling England welcomes it , Cycling England Programme Manger , Steve Garidis echoed Ian Drake 's comments “ British Cycling sits on the board of Cycling England and we wholeheartedly support their plans .
Any plans to increase levels of cycling are mutually beneficial to Cycling England . ”
Representatives of both British Cycling and the CTC sit on the board of Cycling England , which is essentially a body of experts set up by the government and fully funded by the Departments of Health and Transport – it does n't have to compete for members .
So what about Cycling 's two other big membership organisations ?
Sustrans has 40,000 supporters who give monthly donations by direct debit .
They also have 2,500 volunteer rangers helping to look after the National Cycle Network , and promote cycling and Sustrans .
“ We welcome British Cycling 's plan to inspire more people to cycle as means of sustainable transport , recreation and sport .
“ Sustrans has developed a network of over 12,000 miles of nationwide traffic - free facilities which can be enjoyed for sport and recreational purposes as well as everyday journeys .
A third of the National Cycle Network is traffic - free and 75 % of the population live within two miles of it .
“ We are also working to get more people on their bikes .
In 2008 we helped nearly 89,000 children to cycle more often to school , on average doubling regular levels of cycling in schools where we work .
78 % of National Cycle Network users say that it has helped them to increase the amount of physical activity they regularly take .
“ Sport has an important role to play in getting people on their bikes .
Sustrans ' Bike It ' officers will be using top ultra cyclist Jim Rees 's ' Race Across America ' as the theme for one of their annual ' virtual ' bike races in schools .
This year 's race generated a staggering 94,000 extra journeys to school by bike and involved 123 schools .
“ We look forward to working with British Cycling to deliver its vision , which very much compliments our own . ”
Sustrans Policy Adviser Allan Williams , told us .
And the CTC ?
They have more members than any other cycling organisation and British Cycling 's planned move to “ embrace all aspects of cycling ” is a significant move into CTC territory .
Ian Darke may say that British already embrace those areas , but if they do it 's a light embrace .
The CTC did n't want to comment on the record , but a senior official did talk to us off the record .
If we were the sort of website that liked to get all tabloid about this sort of thing we 'd say his attitude could be summed up as “ bring it on ” .
Luckily we 're not .
The CTC was “ in a good place , but not complacent ” he went on to point out that last month it had recorded it 's largest membership since 1895 with 61,500 paying members a fact he contrasted with what he said were the number of discounted and free memberships given away by British Cycling 's and its off - shoot Everyday Cycling .
His reading of British Cycling 's outline plan was that BC had been handed £ 26 m to win four medals at the 2012 Olympics and that the organisation was trying to justify that sum by doing other things too particularly as winning those medal , in his opinion , was not going to be the formality assumed by many .
According to our source the CTC while the organisation had enormous respect for the work done by British Cycling and Dave Brailsford in particular they had noticed a distinct change in the language used by British Cycling in recent months and at the grassroots CTC Cycling Champions and local officials had also noticed a marked change in attiutdes to them from their British Cycling counterparts of late .
“ In a way this is a good thing for us …
In the past there has been a sort of gentleman 's agreement between the organisations : British Cycling had its £ 26 m to win medals ; Sustrans £ 50 m to build infrastructure ; and the CTC took care of campaigning and other forms of cycling …
British Cycling are taking a totally aggressive commercial approach which will sharpen up our attitudes and free us up to expand into areas such as sportive cycling and for our training division to target performance road bike owners . ”
He went on to point out that the CTC already had 21,000 members who were performance cyclists .
“ The next few years will be pretty interesting ” was his summing up of the situation .
We 'll say if British Cycling manages to achieve even half of the targets it has set itself cycling in Britain will be in a much better state .

As businesses continue to shed jobs , and consumers abstain from spending , household income drops by the highest rate on record in June 2009 :
Household income in the U.S. is weakening as the influence of the government ’s stimulus plan wanes , prompting economists , Federal Reserve officials and a Nobel laureate to warn that consumer spending may struggle .
“ Consumers have started to change their behavior and they are going to save more , ” said Richard Berner , co-head of global economics at Morgan Stanley in New York and a former researcher at the Fed .
“ You have pressure on wages , you have employment still declining . ”
Wages and salaries , which drive recoveries in spending , fell 4.7 percent in the 12 months through June , the biggest drop since records began in 1960 , according to Commerce Department figures released yesterday .
The Obama administration ’s tax cuts , extended jobless benefits and a one - time Social Security bonus have helped mask the damage done by the worst employment slump since the Great Depression .
Personal incomes , which include interest income , dividends , rents and other payments as well as wages , tumbled 1.3 percent in June , more than forecast and the biggest drop in four years , yesterday ’s Commerce report showed .
Excluding the effects of the stimulus plan , June incomes would have dropped 0.1 percent after no change in May , according to the report .
In May , one - time additional payments to Social Security recipients boosted incomes 1.3 percent .
One of every 10 American workers will be without a job by early 2010 , economists project , shaking the confidence of those still on payrolls and discouraging spending .
It may take as long as 15 years for consumers to fully repair finances battered by the decline in home values , stocks and employment , said Edmund Phelps , winner of the Nobel prize in economics in 2006 .
Shrinking Net Worth
Decreasing pay is not the only hurdle for consumers .
Plunging home prices and stocks reduced household net worth by a record $ 13.9 trillion from the third quarter of 2007 through this year ’s first quarter , according to figures from the Fed .
“ Households are going to have to do an awful lot of rebuilding of their wealth , ” Phelps , a professor at Columbia University in New York , said this week in an interview on Bloomberg Television .
“ Even if that rebuilding goes on at a pretty good clip , it will take 12 or 15 years for households to get to the wealth level that they had several years ago .
Consumer demand is going to take a long time to rebuild to normal levels . ”
In the second half , incomes and spending will be hurt by the loss of transitory factors such as lower fuel prices , decreased tax rates and the one - time payment to retirees , William Dudley , president of the Fed Bank of New York , said in a speech last week .
Save More
“ Consumer spending is unlikely to rise much faster than income ” because of the need to boost savings , he said .
“ Weak income growth will be an effective constraint on the pace of consumer spending . ”
Companies continue to trim expenses , threatening further cuts in pay and benefits .
Tenneco Inc. , the world ’s largest maker of vehicle - exhaust systems , temporarily lowered pay and hours worked to reduce labor costs by 10 percent .
Earlier this year , the Lake Forest , Illinois - based company suspended contributions to employees ’ 401 ( k ) retirement accounts and cut pay for the top 50 executives .
Government assistance such as the “ cash - for - clunkers ” program will help postpone the inevitable increase in savings and slowdown in spending as more baby boomers approach retirement , said David Rosenberg , chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates Inc. in Toronto .
“ Spending is in desperate need of gimmicks like cash - for - clunkers in order to grow on a short - term basis , ” he said .
Lifting Auto Sales
The program , which offers as much as $ 4,500 for trading in older , less fuel - efficient cars , ran through its $ 1 billion fund in about a week , and Congress is considering adding $ 2 billion .
Auto industry data this week showed sales jumped to an 11.3 million annual pace last month , the highest level since September .
Mounting joblessness is among reasons that economists such as Rosenberg say will prompt Americans to save more .
Unemployment , already at a 26 - year high of 9.5 percent in June , may top 10 percent by early next year , according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg last month .
Economists estimate that a Labor Department report at the end of the week will show employers cut an additional 328,000 workers from payrolls in July .
That would bring the total loss of jobs since the recession began in December 2007 to 6.8 million .
The savings rate in June fell to 4.6 percent as incomes dropped , yesterday ’s Commerce Department report showed .
The rate , which reached a 14 - year high of 6.2 percent the previous month , is likely to keep climbing , Rosenberg said .
A rate as high as 15 percent ca n’t be ruled out , he said .
“ This is a different consumer than we had in the past 20 years , ” Rosenberg said .
“ People are going to increasingly be putting more money into cookie jars , rather than into buying more cookie jars . ”

Send your question to Umbra !
Q. Dear Umbra ,
I ’ve been noticing lately a lot of “ green ” businesses and restaurants in my area using compostable plastics , usually made of corn , if I recall correctly .
I ca n’t compost ( I know , I know , but I live in a tiny apartment on the third floor with no porch or yard ) , and I was wondering if you could tell us any more about this plastic .
Should I recycle it , or throw it away ?
What to do ?
Becky B .
Jamaica Plain , Mass .
A. Dearest Becky ,
USDA.govDoes anyone find pictures of food appetizing ?
Right now I ’m looking at a picture of some artistically arranged marinated olives in a bio-plastic deli container .
I love olives .
These are just repulsive .
Perhaps the key to weight loss is photos of food .
I have a bit of scandale for you with these compostable plastic containers .
The clear plastic # 7 ( which really just means “ other ” ) cups and deli containers are made with PLA , which is usually a corn derivative but could also come from cane sugar .
I was all ready to dork out on the science of PLA , polylactic acid , but then I read this : “ Instead , lactic acid is oligomerized and then catalytically dimerized to make the cyclic lactide monomer . ”
The weather is too nice to spend time unraveling those polymers .
Suffice to say they bacterially ferment the corn , then do all sorts of other stuff to stabilize it and turn it into a plastic .
They can then make cups , fabrics , upholstery … but who are “ they ” ?
PLA is manufactured by agribiz giant Cargill at a plant in Blair , Nebraska .
Cargill is a major player in the genetically modified corn market , is apparently the world ’s largest grain handler , and operates its PLA product division under the name NatureWorks .
The long and short of it is that this “ green ” plastic is made from GMO corn by one of the largest private companies in the United States , one with a terrible track record on environmental issues .
Here is a useful overview of the Cargill - corn plastic connection that our own Tom Philpott penned a few years back .
There are actual mini-scandals regarding Cargill and PLA , such as them trying to make a partnership with Patagonia for a PLA fleece .
Somehow they neglected to mention the GMO corn behind the whole product .
So when we use these cups , we are supporting GMO crops and industrial ag .
And we are not necessarily creating less waste ; yes , the cups are biodegradable , but only in commercial composting facilities or other composts that reach 150 degrees with 90 percent humidity .
So even if you composted in your apartment — which you could ! — you likely would not have the right conditions .
And there are problems with recycling corn plastic too — check with your friendly JP recyclers to see what they prefer .
In the end , these cups can be equal to some products made from oil - based plastic : you just throw them out .
The only lifecycle assessment I could find was obviously pro-Cargill , so I ca n’t say how much petroleum it takes to make them .
But I can say that products from conventional corn , a petroleum - intensive crop , are not the magic bullet .
The magic bullet is to bring your own cup ( on your bike , of course ) .
Polylactically ,
Umbra
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Bank regulators closed four small banks on Friday , bringing the number of failures so far this year to 68 as the struggling economy and falling home prices take their toll on financial institutions .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp estimated the four closures would cost its deposit fund a total of about $ 215.7 million .
In 2008 , 25 U.S. banks were seized by officials , up from only 3 in 2007 .
During the current financial crisis , Seattle - based lender Washington Mutual became the biggest bank to fail in U.S. history .
It was closed in September 2008 after losses from soured mortgages and liquidity problems .
The FDIC also has a running tally of problem banks that its examiners closely monitor .
At the end of the first quarter , 305 undisclosed institutions were on that list .
Friday ’s closures included :
* Peoples Community Bankcorp Inc PCBI.O of West Chester , Ohio , which had $ 705.8 million in assets and about $ 598.2 million in deposits .
The failure is expected to cost the FDIC deposit insurance fund an estimated $ 129.5 million .
The FDIC said First Financial Bankcorp FFBC.O of Hamilton , Ohio agreed to assume the insured deposits of Peoples Community Bank , whose 19 branches will reopen on Monday as branches of First Financial Bank .
The deal also included First Financial and the FDIC entering into a loss - share transaction on about $ 657.6 million in Peoples ' assets .
* First BankAmericano , Elizabeth , New Jersey , which had $ 166 million in assets and $ 157 million in deposits .
The failure is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund an estimated $ 15 million .
The FDIC said Crown Bank of Brick , New Jersey agreed to assume the insured deposits of First BankAmericano , whose six branches will reopen on Monday as branches of Crown Bank .
* Integrity Bank of Jupiter , Florida , which had $ 119 million in assets and $ 102 million in deposits .
The failure is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund an estimated $ 46 million .
The FDIC said Stonegate Bank SGBK .OB of Fort Lauderdale , Florida agreed to assume the insured deposits of Integrity Bank , whose lone branch will reopen on Monday as a branch of Stonegate Bank .
The deal also included Stonegate 's agreement to buy about $ 52 million in assets , with the FDIC keeping the remaining assets for later disposition .
* First State Bank of Altus in Altus , Oklahoma had $ 103.4 million in assets and $ 98.2 million in deposits .
The failure is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund an estimated $ 25.2 million .
The FDIC said Herring Bank of Amarillo , Texas agreed to assume the insured deposits of First State Bank of Altus , whose branches will reopen on Monday as branches of Herring Bank .
The deal also includes Herring Bank buying about $ 64.4 million in assets , with the FDIC keeping the remaining assets for later disposition .
Customers of all four failed banks can access their money over the weekend by check , teller machine or debit card , the FDIC said .
A wealthy mystery man named Charlie runs a detective agency via a speakerphone and his personal assistant , John Bosley .

The launch was scheduled for around 5:00 pm and I liveblogged the launching below .
It was canceled but information is still coming in on what the problem was and when the next launch will be so I will continue to update the post throughout the remainder of the day .
For some more information on the rocket itself see the Wikipedia page here .
----
11:00 pm or so :
An article here says that an official announcement of the problem with the launch will be made tomorrow at 10:30 am , which would be evening in the US ( 9:30 pm in New York ) .
Another one here says that the soonest another launch could happen would be in three days , and more if the launch vehicle has to be taken apart .
We 'll find out the details tomorrow morning then , and that 's probably the extent of what we 're going to find out today .
9:00 pm : Watching the news now and they say the problem was with overly low pressure of a high - pressure tank that was to move the valves of the launcher .
The Russians involved with the launch are also saying that another launch should be possible in a few days after the valves are fixed , perhaps next Wednesday ( exactly one week after today ) , although some others are saying that the launch may not be until September .
8:54 pm : This article says that they expect another launch attempt will be possible within the next few days .
First the exact glitch needs to be found though and they have n't announced exactly what the problem was yet .
8:12 pm : Watching the news now where they are all talking about the delayed launch .
Some are lamenting that the rocket is only composed of some 80 % domestic technology .
I think the numbers are something like 60 % domestic technology for the first stage and 100 % for the second .
Another one says that Korea intends to spend 1 trillion won ( almost a billion dollars ) on space development by 2016 .
7:29 pm : An article here mentions a statement from the centre that these types of delays are common amongst spacefaring countries , which is very true .
6:55 pm :
We know that the problem was with the launching sequence , but this article says that there are 2000 types of data to be looked over which is what is making it take so long to find out exactly where the problem was .
6:01 pm : An article here references someone at the space centre saying that the problem was software - related , an error in the software controlling the launch time for the automatic sequence from the control centre .
Not sure if that is the official word or not .
5:26 pm : All the VIPs have left the seats and no word on exactly what the technical problem was .
A bit more talking about how it sucks that the launch was scrubbed and since there is no word on when the announcement will be made the broadcast has just ended .
As I wrote below , I 'll be updating the post as soon as we find out what the problem was and when the next launch will be .
One article here says that the projected economic benefit from a successful launch would be up to 2.4 trillion won , or $ 1.9 billion USD .
Benefits would be in national branding , technological spinoffs , etc .
5:17 pm : The director of the space centre Lee Ju-jin ( 이주진 ) just said that there will not be another launch attempt today and they are still looking at the problem .
Here 's what he looks like if you 're curious .
5:09 pm :
They 're still talking about what the technical problem might be , and who knows how long it will take to find it or determine the next launch date .
Not much more to liveblog about at the moment , but I have the TV on so I 'll update at soon as they find out what the problem is .
5:06 pm : Ah , it was a " technical problem " with the automatic launching system , so apparently not with the rocket itself .
Now they 're lifting up the blue claws of the rocket erector to take it down .
Sigh .
5:04 pm : Here comes the official announcement ... the director of the space centre just made it but the reporters could n't hear him on the microphone with the bad acoustics in the room .
Heh .
4:57 pm : Looks like the fuel is going to be removed from the rocket soon .
Apparently that means that a launch wo n't be able to happen for at least another four days .
Still waiting for an official announcement on what happened .
4:53 pm : The countdown has stopped at T - 7:56 .
Not sure what the reason is yet , whether this is a delay or a scrub .
Could be a lot of reasons such as an airplane entering the no fly area .
Still waiting for the reason for this .
4:52 pm : The liquid oxygen plume from the side of the rocket can barely be seen now ...
4:51 pm : More numbers - no ships allowed within a 3 km radius of the launching area , contact with the satellite will take place 13 hours after launch ...
4:48 pm : Lots of numbers now as we wait .
Engine firing will start 3.8 seconds before launch , this is the result of 7 years of work , Korea and Russia decided to cooperate on the rocket in 2004 , Korea began its first formal research into rocketry in 1988 ...

Still no problems whatsoever .
4:43 pm : All systems now ready for launch .
Automatic launch procedure to start in 15 minutes , after which it becomes quite difficult to stop the launch .
4:41 pm : Still waiting for final confirmation , looking at the people in the VIP seats .
All old men .
Switching back to the rocket and there 's still not a cloud in the sky ... tum te tum ...
4:37 pm : Just said that they will confirm the launch time in about three minutes and there do n't seem to be any problems with the projected 5 pm launch .
The space centre has a media centre and they 're talking with a reporter that is waiting on final confirmation .
4:36 pm : Talking now about how most countries have failed in their first rocket launches , but also noting that many of these were back in the 50s and 60s and technology has developed considerably since then .
4:32 pm : Talking with a reporter in the area that is with a group of people at a beach where the rocket launch will be able to be seen .
Around 26 minutes to launch , though we 're still waiting for confirmation on the exact time .
4:28 pm : Now switched to a woman giving an overview of how the rocket is going to launch and the facilities at the space centre .
Here 's an overview of the area from Google Maps for you .

4:25 pm : Still no confirmation on if 5 pm is going to be the exact time .
4:23 pm : Weather is still good , not a cloud in the sky .
The rocket can be launched in a temperature of up to 35 degrees and it's 28.3 in Jeollanam - do in the south of the country where the rocket is being launched from , with wind at 4.4 m/s , well within the maximum range of 15 m/s .
4:22 pm : Some basic facts about the rocket as we wait : 140 tonnes , 33 metres in height , and is carrying a 100 kg payload .
Half of the rocket was developed with Russian technology and the other half with Korean technology .

GOP rebranding effort flames out
Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) generated the kind of buzz other politicians covet when he launched his bid to help rebrand the Republican Party last spring .
Television crews and reporters wedged themselves among the crowd of party faithful to cover the National Council for a New America 's first event at a packed pizza parlor in an Arlington , Va. , strip mall .
The resulting coverage dominated cable news chatter for the next week .
Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney were also on board .

But the council has since flamed out – at least publicly .
Since its launch , the National Council has n’t held a single public event , despite more than 5,000 invitations to take their show out on the road .
Congressional ethics rules limit what Cantor can do with the group because he launched it from his leadership office , making it harder to organize events and recruit partners .
Despite that caution , the group is still taking heat from outside watchdog groups that argue he is violating the spirit , and perhaps the letter , of those rules .
Furthermore , the Council has come under criticism from conservatives , like former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who made fun of the group for creating a “ listening tour ” inside the Beltway “ bubble . ”
The low profile is quite a contrast to the May launch party .
When Cantor unveiled the Council , the timing was perfect – it was a dark period for Republicans , and the party was looking for new ideas and new faces to counter - balance the fawning press coverage of President Barack Obama 's 100th day in office .
The week of its unveiling , Pennsylvania Sen .
Arlen Specter switched parties and became a Democrat , an announcement that fueled another round of negative stories for the party – and drew more attention for Cantor 's new group than organizers had planned .
“ The massive national buzz surrounding NCNA was largely media driven , in large part due to coincidental timing with a perfect news cycle , ” said Cantor spokesman Brad Dayspring .
The rollout , Dayspring said , “ was designed to build credibility ” for the new policy forum , and it was n’t meant to be a “ prolonged campaign - style organization . ”
At that first event , Cantor told the crowd at Pie-Tanza that they were launching the group , in large part , because " Our party has taken its licks over the last couple of cycles . ”
And Jeb Bush counseled his fellow Republicans “ not to be nostalgic about the past . ”
But the National Council for a New America has n’t done much about the party ’s future in the days since .
Its biggest event since the launch has been a webcast to about 100,000 online visitors to Pajamas TV , a conservative website .
The Council plans to hold future events with Pajamas TV in the fall , and it is looking to establish partnerships with other Beltway media organizations , including Politico .
Members of Cantor 's staff are also processing the 5,000 invites to figure out a good spot to hold the next forum , but ethics rules make traveling in support of the National Council more difficult than if it were a campaign - related activity .
Democrats – and some Republicans – have since derided the group for failing to capitalize on the early buzz .
The Democratic National Committee issued nine press releases slamming the group shortly after its launch .
“ The first event was designed to launch a concept – an idea to unify Republicans and speak with common voice about real issues facing Americans and their families , ” Dayspring said .
“ Once the organization established credibility , we never operated under any time table .
That notion is partisan spin designed to set false expectations . ”
Organizers understood that it would take time to develop an organization and establish its credibility with voters , and this summer ’s busy congressional schedule has hampered those early efforts to organize , Dayspring said .
And even if the group itself is not publicly claiming credit for any new ideas or outreach beyond the Beltway , its members remain active .
Recently , Barbour and former Speaker Newt Gingrich , met with Cantor ’s whip team to talk strategy in the health care fight .
But the biggest hurdle has been figuring out how to maneuver without violating congressional ethics rules that specifically forbid lawmakers from using their offices for explicitly political purposes .
The National Council for a New America was supposed to be modeled after a congressional caucus , just like the Blue Dog Coalition , the Republican Study Committee or the Congressional Black Caucus .
So before the launch , Cantor aides conferred with veteran Washington ethics lawyer Jan Baran , of Wiley Rein , to make sure they did n’t break any laws through the establishment of this group .
Under those rules , lawmakers can pay for certain events out of their campaign accounts , so Cantor paid for the first event through his personal campaign account .
But that spawned more criticism from watchdog groups than it deflected .
Last month , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington asked the Office of Congressional Ethics , an outside advisory board , to investigate whether Cantor violated House ethics rules by establishing the group through his leadership office .
“ The use of taxpayer funds to support partisan political activities is prohibited by House rules , ” CREW ’s executive director Melanie Sloan argued in her complaint .
“ Therefore , the Office of Congressional Ethics should investigate to determine if Rep. Cantor violated House rules by using official resources to support NCNA .
If he did , this matter should be forwarded to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct for further review and appropriate sanctions . ”
Cantor aides acknowledge the complicated legal terrain , but said they have done everything in their power to ensure their boss obeys all the relevant laws and congressional ethics rules .
" We had twin goals , " said Cantor deputy chief of staff Rob Collins , " Have a conversation with the American people about how to solve the problems they confront , and , in doing that , we wanted to make sure we were 100 percent compliant with the rules governing members of Congress . "
The group won early endorsements from Cantor 's fellow congressional leaders .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader John Boehner signed on , along with Sen. John McCain , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , who created a similar group during his stint as chairman the Republican National Committee .
Despite the backing of big names , however , some Republicans have soured on the group .
Some complained that it would dilute from the GOP message by adding another group to the party ’s infrastructure .
Others griped that it was just a vehicle for 2012 hopefuls – and Cantor .
And conservatives were upset that the group ignored social issues , like abortion and gay rights , during its first event , focusing instead on economic issues .
In a column on the Fox News website , Huckabee , the surprise presidential candidate of 2008 who may cast another outsider ’s bid in 2012 , said it was “ hard to keep from laughing out loud when people living in the bubble of the Beltway suddenly wake up one day and think they ought to have a listening tour . ”
The group has since become something of an albatross for Cantor as lawmakers and aides speculate about its future .
“ Eric Cantor is a smart guy with a bright future , ” said one Republican aide .
“ If he ’d taken a little more time to figure it out and a little less thinking of the next day headlines , this thing could ’ve been a real success . ”
Updated at 1:33 p.m .
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Friday that a new agency focused on protecting U.S. consumers is needed because the mission currently is too scattered among various regulators .
This results in " finger - pointing in place of action , " he told the House Financial Services Committee .
The administration 's plan to create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency has bumped up against opposition from Republicans , industry and federal regulators .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has argued that the central bank is best suited for the role .
Monitoring risk and protecting consumers are " closely related , and thus entail both informational advantages and resource savings , " Bernanke said in prepared testimony .
Geithner chalked up the pushback to federal regulators wanting to protect their territory .
" With great respect to the chairman and other supervisors who are reluctant to do this , they are doing what they should , which is defend the traditional perrogatives of their agencies , " Geithner said .
" I think frankly all arguments should be viewed through that prism . "
Rep . Ron Paul and other Republicans on the panel said it was foolish to give " unelected bureacrats " the authority to determine what financial products are fair .
" They will be empowered to decide which credit cards we can receive , which home mortgages we are permitted to possess , and even whether we can access an ATM machine , " he said .
Rep. Barney Frank , the panel 's Democratic chairman , said Republicans are not being practical .
Frank supports the creation of the agency but has delayed a vote on it until after the August recess to give critics a chance to weigh in .
" Ideology should n't be driving this , " he said .
Bernanke 's push back comes as he is nearing the end of his term .
After it expires early next year , President Barack Obama will have to decide whether to reappoint him .
Bernanke , an appointee of President George W. Bush , took over the Fed in February 2006 .
The proposal to create a consumer protection agency is part of a broader overhaul of the nation 's financial rules .
The agency would monitor the fine print on such products as credit cards and mortgages .
Such oversight is now scattered among the Fed and other agencies .
House Republicans have offered an alternative .
Their bill would strip the Fed of its regulatory role and abolish the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision .
In their place would be a single regulator for depository institutions , which would include an office focused on consumer protections .
The Obama administration counters that its proposed agency could monitor nonbank institutions too , ensuring there are n't any gaps in oversight .
The administration 's plan also would tap the Fed to be the regulator of huge , globally interconnected financial companies whose collapse could endanger the entire U.S. financial system and the broader economy .
Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress are leery of giving the Fed additional powers when they think its regulatory oversight of banks and risky mortgages led to the current financial crisis .

Along with burgers and fireworks , Canadians celebrated by answering surveys about themselves .
Among the findings on multiculturalism , seal meat ( 5 % eat it ) and hockey ( 52 % play it ) , 85 % " see themselves as fundamentally different from Americans . "
Only 13 percent " see a future scenario where Canada becomes part of the U.S. "

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- A U.S. defense - budget request from Congress for new business jets has drawn fire from the Pentagon .
" Whether the funding is added to the budget or taken from somewhere else , it ultimately comes out of things that we believe are more important , " said Geoff Morrell , a Pentagon spokesperson .
" And once we get saddled for additional planes we did n't ask for , then we have to find where in the budget we can cut to fund their operations . "
As first reported by The Wall Street Journal , House representatives want to purchase two modified Gulfstream 550 business jets and two modified Boeing BA , +1.15 % 737s for a total of about $ 550 million .
The request was an add - on to a Pentagon request for one Gulfstream 550 , built by a unit of General Dynamics GD , - 0.41 % , and one 737 , along with a request to purchase two 737s currently being leased .
No one from the House Committee on Appropriations was available to comment Monday .
The request now has to be approved by the Senate .
The Department of Defense in the midst of adjusting its priorities , dumping some high - cost procurement programs to fund a fight against insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq .
It comes as the U.S. is facing a greater budget deficit due not just from the wars , but from large bailout packages to firm up the country 's financial and auto industries , shaken by the global recession .
In June , Congress seemed to recognize this new reality and voted against additional funding for more F - 22 fighters jet to free up more cash for the F - 35 .
See full story .
A good deal in the long term , but it could come with a political cost
According to the Air Force , only the modified Gulfstream would be used to transport members of Congress , and only on official trips .
Laurence Korb , a former government official and now a defense budget analyst with the Center for American Progress , said Congress was likely fed up with having to postpone trips due to there being too few aircraft .
" These are for official Congressional trips only , it 's not to take them home for the weekend , " Korb said in an interview .
For example , " this is for a group of House members who want to go to Mexico to [ study ] the war on drugs or something else . "
" But what has happened is that this has become symbolic of the earmarks and all the other things people have concerns about , " he said .
And it makes Congress look hypocritical .
Last year its members expressed outrage over auto executives that took private jet flights to Washington D.C. to ask for bailout money , saying then it symbolized Wall Street and corporate excess .
But putting aside from the budget spat between Congress and the Pentagon , purchasing the new jets could also be a better deal for the country in the long run , given the age of the current fleet of Gulfstream III jets that Congress uses now .
Those aircraft have been in service since the early ' 80s and have extremely high maintenance costs .
In an August report from Aviation Week , the upkeep for a G550 is about $ 5,093 for every 1,000 nautical miles flown , while a GIII is about $ 9,556 .
So for every 10,000 hours of fight time , the G550 would save taxpayers about $ 45 million , said Nick Tarascio , Chief Executive of Air East Airways Inc. , a flight services company in Farmingdale , N.Y .
" It 's comparable to buying a new house versus buying an old house , " Tarascio said .
" It 's a bigger initial investment , but over time it 's a better deal ... it 's a more efficient way to operate . "
The G550 is more fuel efficient and has improved technology compared to the GIII , Tarascio said .
Additionally , the G550 makes less noise than a GIII , allowing it to fly into more airports and at any time .
Then there is the cost .
Business jet demand has plunged in the past year due to the economic recession , encouraging dealers to lower their prices .
According to Ascend , an aerospace consultancy , the price of G550 has fallen more than 27 % in the past year to $ 42 million from $ 58 million , though that cost does n't include any " value - added materials " such as secure communication links and cushy interiors .
For the Air Force 's part , it would buy the jet for $ 66 million after adding on its hardware , which likely includes a lot of advanced military technology .
An Air Force spokesperson could n't provide a breakdown of its cost .
The House may have considered all of these things when it voted for the jets , but it can also be seen as a way to put some of their constituents to work .
Business jet manufacturers , including Gulfstream , having been laying off workers as the demand for jets have declined .
The jets Congress wants to purchase are assembled in the U.S. with parts made primarily in this country across 29 states , said Robert Baugniet , a spokesperson with Gulfstream .
Only the engines , made by Rolls Royce ( RR ) and part of its tail are made overseas , he said .
She says it was only the second time she had drunk alcohol in her life , and even then it was just a few of glasses of beer .
But it was enough for a Muslim court in Malaysia to order Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno , a part - time model and mother - of - two , to be caned .
The corporal punishment case has divided the Asian nation and led human rights campaigners to urge the authorities to show restraint .
Now , in her first interview , Ms Kartika has urged the authorities to carry out the punishment in public .
" I never cried when I was sentenced by the judge , " she told Reuters at her father 's house in a village 200 miles north of Kuala Lumpur .
" I told myself , all right then , let 's get on with it . "
Ms Kartika , who would be the first woman to be caned in the Muslim - majority country , is actually a citizen of neighbouring Singapore , and does not even live in Malaysia .
But last year she was caught drinking at a hotel in Kuantan in the eastern Malaysian state of Pahang during a police raid .
Under Malaysian law , while it is legal for non-Muslims to drink alcohol , Muslims – even foreigners – may not .

Last month , a sharia court that operates in parallel with the country 's normal judicial system and is available for trying so - called " religious crimes " ordered that she pay a 5,000 ringgit fine ( £ 860 ) and be caned six times , after she pleaded guilty to drinking three glasses of beer .
Ms Kartika , who also works in a hospital , had the opportunity to appeal against the sentence but decided not to .
Now both she and her father have raised the stakes by demanding that the punishment be done in public , in order to deter other Muslims who might be tempted to drink alcohol in the country .
Whether this might constitute some sort of brinkmanship designed to call the bluff of the authorities is unclear .
But the 32 - year - old insisted that the 20 - month ordeal had ruined her life and forced her to resign from her position with the hospital .
Since then she has only worked as a part - time model .
" I only declared I was a model to protect my full - time job , " she said .
" I felt very humiliated because people used my status as a part - time model to publicise my case . "
Her father , Shukarno Abdul Muttalib , has also suggested that the caning should take place in public .
" As a Muslim , I agree with her punishment , but I do n't agree that it should be done in jail , she is not a prisoner , " he told Bloomberg News .
" If the authorities want to use this as an example , then the caning should be done in public . "
On Monday Ms Kartika is due to be taken to a prison in central Selangor state for seven days .
At some point during that time , the punishment will be carried out .
According to the regulations , she will be fully clothed at the time of caning and kneeling down .
Officials have said she will be struck on the backside using a small thin cane and only with moderate force .
They insist it is not intended to hurt her .
An unidentified " whipping officer " told local journalists : " Sharia whipping is more like caning naughty schoolboys .
In sharia the punishment is not in the force of the whipping but to bring shame .
The whipping implement is supposed to be soft and supple , so as to inflict the least pain . "
But campaigners say that whether Ms Kartika suffers pain during the ordeal or not is beside the point .
Amnesty International and other campaigners have urged the courts to drop the sentence , saying it was " cruel , inhuman and degrading punishment and prohibited under international human rights law " .
Amnesty said that at least 34,923 migrants , mainly from South - east Asian countries , were caned in Malaysia between 2002 and 2008 for immigration offences .
" They have been doing it with some gusto , " Amnesty 's Asia director , Sam Zarisi , commented .
" Usually these sentences are carried out on migrants .
This is the first time a woman will have been caned , and the first time someone will have been caned under sharia law .
It 's an unfortunate direction . "
In Malaysia , opinions are divided about the punishment Ms Kartika faces .
" Nobody should have to endure corporal punishment , " said Ragunath Kesavan , president of the Malaysian Bar Council .
He said a public caning would be unacceptable to many and would set an unwelcome precedent .
You know , we wish we could say that there was more to this DIY cameraphone macro hack than tearing the lens out of an old DVD player and duct taping it over that of the cameraphone -- but there really is n't .

I am not sure about the authenticity of the quote , but I am amused by putting a photo of a person armed with a modern shotgun over a caption talking about rifles .
Since the image is popular , I decided to make a slightly more authentic variation on it : Fri , Jun .

The most amusing paragraph I remember was about Sgt. Shaftoe not liking " those paranoid types " flying his transport plane , then it listed how many weapons he had to remove in order to sleep semi-comfortably .

This quote is a mystery actually .
There has been no clear attribution to Yamamoto .
Factcheck.org has ruled it as a fabricated quote .
However , FactCheck is funded by George Soros and the Kenyan used to be on its board so I take it with a grain of salt .
Most reputable research has put it down as " unknown veracity "

Perhaps I chose my words poorly ; I mostly meant the comment as a jab at those within this country who , no matter which enemy we may currently be at odds with , always seem to fall all over themselves to put down our country while exalting the enemy .
Such as individuals at a protest in Washington state not too long ago , who wore masks similar to those that Al Qaeda and the like do in their film appearances , while burning / defecating upon American flags , and burning U.S. Soldiers in effigy .
In other words , the kinds of people who do n't like the idea of Armed Citizens and would not lift a finger to fight any kind of invading force .

A Canadian firm has announced imminent flight tests of aviation data - streaming technology which would transmit information normally recorded in an aircraft 's " black box " accident recorders " in real time " .
In cases such as that of the recent disappearance of Air France flight 447 above the Atlantic , there would be no need to recover the black boxes in order to find out what happened .
The firm in question is AeroMechanical Services Ltd of Calgary , presenting upgrades to its existing FLYHT ™ Automated Flight Information Reporting System ( AFIRS ) 220 " smart box " .
According to AeroMechanical , the AFIRS 220 can already be set up to transmit regular " short burst " data updates to ground - based web servers , maintaining a record of both GPS satnav and flight data recorder information for a given aircraft .
In the event of an incident , the box can now use " Emergency Mode data streaming " to update the ground server rapidly .
The system uses Iridium satcomms , which has the advantage of uninterrupted global coverage and no requirement for an oriented dish antenna .
Iridium is distinctly limited in bandwidth , but the company says it has developed proprietary compression tech which can overcome this .
Patented technology compresses flight data to fully utilize available bandwidth , allowing it to send substantially more information than an aircraft with a standard satellite communications system .
The emergency mode data streaming enhancement to the AFIRS 220 system is the subject of a new patent application .
The equipment can also carry a voice channel , functioning in effect as a satellite phone for the air crew , and has a manual alert button for use in hijackings or " other non-system related emergency " .
The firm says that AFIRS 220 has already been adopted by 30 different aircraft operators on 6 continents , all of whom will be able to adopt the new real - time black box streaming tech .
The new emergency - mode kit is to commence in - service trials with an unnamed customer " within the next few weeks " . ®

Solar power lights are more reliable and save energy and money
This is not a typical town square in Uruguay .
The square , in the town of Suarez some 40 km from the capital Montevideo , has gone over to solar energy and LED technology .
The aim is to reduce electricity costs and at the same time light more streets .
If it works , the plan could serve as a model for other towns across the country .
In the current economic crisis and upward pressure on electricity prices , it should be a way of reducing energy costs .
Energy savings
" The energy crisis will continue to get worse and city councils and the state will have to deal with that , " Leonardo D'Andrea of the local town council explained to BBC Mundo .
TAKING THE PULSE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
The BBC is Taking the Pulse of the Global Economy , looking at a range of subjects this summer Consumer behaviour - how have lifestyles changed over the year Food prices - which remain a concern particularly in many developing economies
Highly volatile energy prices - which have been a major issue in the past year
The plight of migrant workers - as the global recession takes hold in many economies Housing markets - which have turned from boom to bust in many countries Rising unemployment levels - as firms cut back because of falling orders
BBC World Food Price Index Taking the Pulse explained " We decided to try out solar energy lamps in the town square and if it works , then we will apply it to all public lights in the town , " he said .
" The lighting had been very unstable and a few years ago we installed sodium lights , which are more modern but use a lot of energy and are more polluting . "
" Each lamp costs $ 30 a month ( £ 18 ) and we know that with LED lamps we would save between 70 % and 90 % on energy costs . "
Light emitting diodes ( LED ) are semi-conductors which give bright light but use very little energy .
They can be charged with solar energy as well as electricity and can give light for up to four days .
" These lamps are very expensive if you buy them from China , Taiwan or Japan , " says Juan José Marchelli , director of Uruled , the local firm which proposed the experiment .
Locally made
This is why he decided to import the diodes but manufacture the bulbs locally .
It is hoped that new jobs will be created " We recycled lamp posts which had fallen into disrepair . "
" Instead of glass , we put in anti-vandal polycarbonate and we adapted lamps that were made in Uruguay . "
" Then we introduced solar panels into the supports , " he said .
The authorities are examining how cost - effective they are .
If they prove worthwhile they will buy equipment to make the lamps in Uruguay .
" The idea is to manufacture the lights in Uruguay and replace high energy lighting with these low energy ones .
At the same time we 'll create jobs in the community , " says Mr Marchelli .
Savings Nicolas Vilaro , director - general of public works in Canelones said : " With electricity prices continuing to rise , we are trying to find alternatives , however small the scale . "
The city council 's energy bill comes $ 400,000 and about 70 % of that is for street lighting .
" For that reason we are keen to make even the smallest of energy savings so we can free up money for other projects , " says Mr Vilaro .
" We are going to install some 20 columns with solar panels and energy accumulators to test out their efficiency , " he says .
" Maybe in a few years ' time you wo n't see single posts with a bulb - they 'll all have solar panels behind them . "

Name Virtual Machine Process label Virtual Machine Image Label Virtual Machine 1 system_u:system_r:svirt_t:s0:c0,c10 system_u:object_r:svirt_image_t:s0:c0,c1 0 Virtual Machine 2 system_u:system_r:svirt_t:s0:c101,c230 system_u:object_r:svirt_image_t:s0:c101 ,c 230
Name SELinux Context Description Virtual Machine Processes system_u:system_r:svirt_t:MCS1
MCS1 is a randomly selected MCS field .
Currently we support ~ 500,000 labels .
Virtual Machine Image system_u:object_r:svirt_image_t:MCS1
Only svirt_t processes with the same MCS fields are able to read / write these image files and devices .
Virtual Machine Shared Read / Write content system_u:object_r:svirt_image_t:s0
All svirt_t processes are allowed to write to the svirt_image_t : s0 files and devices .
Virtual Machine Shared Shared Read Only content system_u:object_r:svirt_content_t:s0
All svirt_t processes are able to read files / devices with this label .
Virtual Machine images system_u:object_r:virt_content_t:s0
When a virtual machine exits , its image file is relabeled to the system default , which usually is virt_content_t : s0 , No svirt_t virtual processes are allowed to read files / devices with this label .
Next week I will be at the Red Hat Summit talking about SELinux , specifically sVirt , Secure Virtualization .
While virtualization seems to be next big thing , providing great opportunities in resource allocation , system management , savings on power and cooling , and the ability to grow and shrink resources depending on demand .
But what about the security ?
What happens when a cracker breaks into a virtual machine and takes it over ?
What happens if there is a bug in the hypervisor ?
Before virtualization , we had isolated servers .
A cracker taking over one server meant that he controlled just that server .
The cracker would then have to launch network attacks against other servers in the environment .
System administrators had lots of tools to defend against network attacks on machines : firewalls , network traffic analysis tools , intrusion detection tools , etc .
After virtualization , we have multiple services running on the same host .
If a virtual machine is broken into , the cracker just needs to break though the hypervisor .
If a hypervisor vulnerability exists , the cracker can take over all of the virtual machines on the host .
He can even write into any virtual host images that are accessible from the host machine .
This is very scary stuff .
The question is not " if " , but " when " .
Hacker / cracker conventions are already examining hypervisor vulnerabilities .
Crackers have already broken though the xen hypervisor , as I documented in one of my previous blogs
Now let 's examine libvirtd / qemu/ kvm in Fedora 11. libvirtd starts all virtual machines .
All virtual machines run as separate processes .
Virtual images are stored as files or devices like logical volumes and iscsi targets .
Hmmm , What is SELinux really good at ?
It is great at labeling processes , files , and devices .
It is great at defining rules on how labeled processes interact with labeled processes , files , and devices .
Seems like a nice match .
SELinux can be used to mitigate the problems of a vulnerability in the hypervisor .
But , you ask , " Did n't we do this in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 ? "
Yes , but we were still vulnerable to the Xen breakout .
If you read the Xen vulnerability document , it explains the mechanism used to thwart SELinux protection in RHEL5 .
The cracker realized that the xen process , labeled xend_t , was allowed to read / write all fixed disks labeled fixed_disk_device_t .
This allowed the cracker to break out of the SELinux confinement by writing to the physical disk .
When I was writing policy for Xen in RHEL5 , I had initially required the administrator to label volume xen image devices as xen_image_t .
The xen developers thought this was too difficult for the administrators to have to manage , and would cause too many failures .
We ran out of time to make the management tool do this automatically .
It was decided that usability was more important then security in this instance , and I had to allow this access .
I wo n't make that mistake again .
In Fedora 11 , James Morris , Daniel Berrange , myself and others have added SELinux support to libvirt , in the form of sVirt .
We added a security plug - in architecture to libvirt that defaults to SELinux protection .
Theoretically you can use other security architectures .
libvirt dynamically labels the image files and starts the virtual machines with the correct labels .
This allows us to avoid the problem of the administrator having to remember to set the correct label on the image files and devices .
By default all virtual machines in F11 get labeled with the svirt_t type and all image files get the svirt_image_t type .
SELinux policy has rules that allow the svirt_t processes to read / write svirt_image_t files and devices .
This protection allows us to protect the host machine from any of its virtual machines .
A virtual machine will only be able to interact with the files and devices with the correct labels .
A compromised virtual machine would not be allowed to read my home directory , for example , even if the virtual machine is running as root .
However , this " type " protection does not prevent one virtual machine from attacking another virtual machine .
We needed a way to label the domains and the image files with the same TYPES , but at the same time , stop virtual machine 1 , running as svirt_t , attacking virtual machine 2 , which would also be running as svirt_t .
Multi Category Security ( MCS ) to the rescue !
When we developed RHEL5 we added Multi Level Security ( MLS ) support .
This involved adding a fourth field to the SELinux context .
Originally in RHEL4 the SELinux context consisted of three fields ( " USER : ROLE : TYPE " ) .
In RHEL5 the SELinux context consists of four fields ( " USER : ROLE : TYPE : MLS " ) .
For example , files in the home directory could be labeled " system_u:system_r:user_home_t:TopSecretRecipe " .
The MLS labels define a sensitivity level ( s0 - s15 ) and category of the data ( c0.c1023 ) , TopSecretRecipe in the example above is a human - readable translation of a field like s15:c0.c36 .
The MLS label allows MLS machines to not only label the file based on its use , user_home_t in this example , but also by the sensitivity and nature of its content , " TopSecretRecipe " .
This field was only used in MLS policy .
We attempted to make use of it in our default policy ( " targeted " ) , by only defining a single sensitivity level ( " s0 " ) and allowing administrators to define categories .
We called this Multi Category Security ( MCS ) .
The goal was to allow administrators and users to label their files based on the nature of their contents .
For example , system_u:object_r:database_t:PatientRecord could be a database which contained patient records .
For multiple reasons , MCS has not been widely used .
I believe you are still better off defining a new SELinux type patient_record_database_t -- MCS does not afford the richness of access control that you can express with standard SELinux types .
When we were developing sVirt , though , we realized that we could use MCS to provide us separation between two virtual machines running with the same SELinux type , svirt_t .
We designed libvirt to assign a different randomly - selected MCS label to each virtual machine and its associated virtual image .
libvirt guarantees that the MCS fields it selects are unique .
SELinux prevents different virtual machines running with different MCS fields from interacting with each other or any of their content .
For example , libvirt creates two virtual machines with these labels :
SELinux prevents virtual machine 1 ( system_u:system_r:svirt_t:s0:c0,c10 ) from accessing virtual machine 2's image file ( system_u:object_r:svirt_image_t:s0:c101,c230 ) -- the virtual machines can not attack each other .
These are the labels libvirt assigns .
We also added the ability to do static labeling to sVirt .
Static labels allow the administrator to select a particular label , including the MCS / MLS field , for a virtual machine .
The virtual machine will always be started with that label .
Administrator who run static virtual machines are responsible for setting the correct label on the image files .
libvirt will never modify the label of a statically - labelled virtual machine 's content .
This allows the sVirt component to run in an MLS environment .
You can run multiple virtual machines on a libvirt system at different sensitivity levels .
Is it me or has the concept of fact - checking gone completely out the window in today ’s mainstream media ?
Here ’s a recent excerpt from an article in the Investor ’s Business Daily on health care reform :
The U.K. ’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) basically figures out who deserves treatment by using a cost-utility analysis based on the “ quality adjusted life year . ”
One year in perfect health gets you one point .
Deductions are taken for blindness , for being in a wheelchair and so on .
The more points you have , the more your life is considered worth saving , and the likelier you are to get care .
People such as scientist Stephen Hawking would n’t have a chance in the U.K. , where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man , because of his physical handicaps , is essentially worthless .
Only one teeny - tiny , eensy - weensy problem with that logic , points out Steve Benen :
One of the things that GOP posterboy Bobby Jindal criticized in his response to Obama ’s address to Congress was “ volcano monitoring . ”
Jindal thinks it ’s silly , and a waste of taxpayer money .
Well , one of the volcanos that Jindal finds silly is apparently ready to blow .
Ironically , it ’s just outside of Anchorage .
I was in Anchorage the last time Mount Redoubt blew in December 1989 .
It was surreal .
We were driving to an officemate ’s sister ’s place when we heard on the radio that the volcano blew .
Weird , we thought .
I did n’t have a camera with me ( it was 1989 , no cell phone cams back then – well , no cell phones other than the huge luggables that John McCain still uses ) .
As we were driving , suddenly we noticed a black cloud on the horizon .
Over the minutes , it crept closer .
And closer .
Suddenly , 1/3 of the sky was black .
The rest was sunny and clear .
It was afternoon , I think – maybe even noon .
But I remember it was a clear sunny day , except for the black mass that was slowly advancing on us as we drove down the highway .
By the time we got to my friend ’s sister ’s house , the sky was black .
Pitch black .
Street lights came on .
It was the middle of a sunny day .
And it was darker than the darkest closet , lights off , middle of the night .
But there were no stars .
Nothing .
I ’ve seen few things as creepy , and nothing as apocalyptic - seeming , in my life .
The city initiated a quarantine , so I was stuck at my friend ’s sister ’s for 24 hours .
Then the ash fell .
Fascinating .
A snowshower of volcanic ash – they ’re these sort of large grey snowflakes that fall even slower than snowflakes .
Beautiful in a way .
But not very good for you , healthwise .
Volcanic ash has a way of making you choke .
It nearly brought down a commercial airliner after it got sucked into the planes engines and they all turned off .
The next morning I had to cab it through the volcanic ash over to the FAA headquarters in town because Senator Stevens was upset that I was n’t at work .
Mind you , it was still pitch black , in the middle of the morning , and everything in town , the roads , the buildings , the cars , everything was covered in volcanic ash .
We were all wearing surgical masks to help our breathing .
We were still under quarantine , and Stevens was pissed that I was n’t at work .
Ah , the memories .
Anyway , I made it to work , then back to my hotel .
The ash started making its way into the hotels , into everything .
The central heating was bringing in the ash , and you could feel it in your throat .
It was a bit scary .
I think at the time I did n’t use my camera because they were warning us that the ash could kill any electronic device ( it was so gritty , it would lodge in any moving parts ) , and I was n’t willing to sacrifice my new $ 700 SLR that mom and dad got me .
So , no pics .
Anyway , this is what Bobby Jindal finds silly .
Bobby Jindal who does n’t mind sucking at the teat of the federal government any time a strong wind blows through New Orleans has a problem helping other states through their own natural disasters .
Then again , he is a Republican .
And we learned long ago that Republicans love to practice what they preach against .
Lord Turner made the comments in a roundtable discussion
The boss of UK watchdog the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) says he would be happy to consider a tax on banks to prevent excessive bonus payments .
FSA chairman Lord Turner also told Prospect magazine that the financial services sector had " grown beyond a socially reasonable size " .
The FSA said he was " not setting out any new policy " and the government said taxation was a matter for the Treasury .
The FSA 's regulations on bonuses have been criticised for being too weak .
They were announced on 12 August , five days after Lord Turner took part in Prospect 's roundtable discussion .
' A ploy '
The new rules , which will come into effect in January , will ensure bank bonuses are not guaranteed for more than a year , and that senior employees have their bonuses spread over at least three years .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I think this illustrates Lord Turner 's frustration at the ' back to business as usual ' mode of the financial services industry , " said John McFall , chairman of the House of Commons Treasury Committee .
" In effect he 's saying ' Why should the financial services industry be alone in requiring this model of bonuses ? ' and that it is not in line with the rest of the economy . "
But some analysts have suggested there may be political reasons for Lord Turner to be sounding tough on the City .
" [ The comments ] may be a ploy to persuade Mr Osborne and the Conservatives that , were they to be elected , they should retain the FSA rather than pass the baton for regulation to the Bank of England , which is one of the shadow cabinet 's proposals , " James Bevan from CCLA Investment Management told the BBC .
Lord Turner said that a tax on financial transactions in the City would cut banks ' profits , and thereby reduce the funds available for bonuses .
He said it could be " a nice sensible revenue source for funding global public goods " .
But he conceded that " the problem is that getting global agreement will be very difficult " .
French rules G20 leaders have been discussing bonuses and said in April that they would clamp down on excessive pay .
French banks have recently agreed to a new set of rules .
These mean there will be penalties for traders who lose money , as well as rewards for success .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said he will press for tougher controls on bankers ' bonuses at the next G20 summit in the US city of Pittsburgh in September .
Chancellor Alistair Darling will be raising the issue at next week 's summit of G20 finance ministers .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It may prove counter productive as business may move away to a more conducive environment Jacques , UK The British Bankers ' Association warned of the dangers of taking action that would drive financial services companies overseas .
" We are the top centre in the world for global banking ... that 's an achievement that we should n't take lightly , " its spokesman Brian Capon said .
" If we introduce the wrong kind of regulation or the wrong kind of taxes we could so easily lose that position by driving business abroad , " he said .
' Socially useless ' Lord Turner also addressed the question of whether the financial services sector had become too big .
He condemned some financial innovation as " socially useless " , questioning whether " the world would have been better off without any credit default swaps " .
" There clearly are bits of the financial system ... which have grown beyond a socially reasonable size , " he added .
He said that you could tell that by considering " what percentage of highly intelligent people from our best universities went into financial services " .

THIS is very serious .
Britain , as most readers of this newspaper know , has long been populated by three warlike tribes , the Scots , the English and the Welsh .
Much of British history consists of disputes between these tribes , particularly between the Scots and the English .
Since the middle of the 18th century , after Bonnie Prince Charlie made a vain attempt to reclaim the kingdom for the Scottish Stuart dynasty , an uneasy peace has prevailed , based , in part , on the understanding that Scottish pride and Scottish feathers will not be unduly ruffled .
But then , every so often , somebody threatens this delicate understanding with an outrageous suggestion .
This usually happens in August , when newspapers have nothing better to talk about .
And it has happened again this August .
The insult to the Scots this year is that haggis , the Scottish national dish , is not really Scottish , but English .
Now this may seem a matter of little consequence to Americans , but how would the United States react if apple pie and turkey with cranberry sauce were to be claimed as the products of , say , French cuisine ?
Or if somebody asserted that baseball was invented by the Romanians ( which it was ) ?
These things are a matter of national pride , and people should take great care when talking about them .
The basis of the current claim is that an English cookbook of the early 17th century contains a recipe for haggis .
This , we are told , was well before any Scottish recipe book gives similar information .
Well , now , this assertion is so patently flimsy that it hardly requires refutation .
Of course there was no published Scottish recipe for haggis before then , for the simple reason that it would have been quite unnecessary for Scots to publish a recipe for something that everybody in Scotland knew how to make .
Why state the obvious ?
It ’s as simple as that .
At the Google I/ O conference earlier this year , the search giant revealed an intriguing new communication service called Wave that aims to deliver concurrent messaging and collaborative editing in a single cohesive environment .
The underlying Wave Federation Protocol is designed to make it possible for third parties to host their own interoperable Wave instances .
Google intends to open the source code of its own implementation in order to encourage widespread adoption of the protocol .
The company took its first major steps in that direction on Friday by releasing the source code of its Operational Transform ( OT ) code and a simple client / server reference implementation that is built on top of the protocol .
This code , which is available under the open source Apache Software License , will give developers a way to start experimenting with the protocol and potentially even building their own Wave - compatible services .
" To kickoff Federation Day , we open sourced two components : 1 ) the Operational Transform ( OT ) code and the underlying wave model , and 2 ) a basic client / server prototype that uses the wave protocol , " says an announcement in the official Google Wave developer blog .
" The OT code is the heart and soul of the collaborative experience in Google Wave and we plan that code will evolve into the production - quality reference implementation , "
One of the most sophisticated characteristics of Wave is its deep support for concurrent communication .
Multiple users can be manipulating the same content at the same time and user activity is immediately visible to other participants .
This means that each individual character appears on the screen of all active users as it is being typed .
Providing that level of concurrency in a seamless way and making it scale to accommodate a significant number of users is an extremely difficult problem to solve , especially in a highly diverse and extensible medium that can support rich media and other kinds of content .
The architecture of Google Wave is largely built around the concept of Operational Transformation .
In Wave , individual operations are immediately performed locally and then get transmitted to the server , where all of the operations will converge .
Then , the updated operational state history will be propagated back out to the individual clients .
Applying the user 's actions immediately in the local user interface rather than first propagating all events and rendering them linearly in true chronological order will help to ameliorate the perception of lag .
Google refers to this behavior as " optimistic " user interaction .
Because of the complexity of Wave 's concurrency model , Google is concerned that third - party implementations of the underlying OT framework will not be able to interoperate correctly with each other .
Google aims to provide a standard production - quality reference implementation that all adopters will be able to use in order to minimize the risk of inconsistent behavior .
The company says that it will also provide comprehensive testing frameworks to help guarantee the compatibility of third - party implementations .
" In a federated system , it is critical that each wave provider manage the operation stream consistently , otherwise convergence cannot be guaranteed , " wrote Google 's Jochen Bekmann in a message posted to the Wave Protocol Google Group .
" This means it is highly recommended that anyone attempting to federate waves should exactly match the [ concurrency control ] functionality of every other wave server .
We believe this is easiest if our released code is used . "
The OT code that Google has released to the public is more recent than the version that is running today in the company 's Wave Sandbox developer prototype .
This reflects the rapid pace at which the protocol and its specification are evolving .
Google is working on updating its sandbox version and bringing it into alignment with the latest OT code .
At that point , the company hopes to enable federated messaging on the sandbox , giving third - party developers a working Wave instance with which to test the interoperability of their own .
Wave is highly exciting technology with enormous potential .
As the platform opens further , it 's likely that we will see Google 's Wave protocol reference implementation code repurposed in innovative ways and integrated with other independent services .

OTTAWA - Facebook has agreed to change some of its privacy policies in response to criticism from a Canadian watchdog over how much personal information it was keeping on file and sharing with third - party application developers .
The changes , such as altering language in its privacy policy , will take place within the next month or so .
More complicated technical changes will take up to a year .
" We are satisfied that with these changes Facebook is on the way to meeting the requirements of Canada 's privacy law , " federal privacy commissioner Jennifer Stoddart said this morning after revealing the popular social networking site has agreed to change the way it collects , stores and shares personal data within a year .
" The privacy of people using the site , not only in Canada but around the world , will be far better protected .
" This is hugely significant , " Stoddart continued .
" Facebook has 12 million users in Canada alone - that is about a third of our population - and well more than 200 million users of Facebook worldwide .
All those users will have a far clearer view of how they perceive information is being shared once Facebook implements our recommendations .
They will also have far more control over what they are sharing and with whom . "
Richard Allan , director of European privacy and policy at Facebook , noted Stoddart had praised the company for its cooperation .
" They shared with us as a common goal making the Internet more privacy - friendly for users around the world , " Allan said in a conference call from London .
Stoddart released a scathing report last month that said Facebook violated Canadian privacy legislation by keeping the personal information of its millions of users around the world on file indefinitely even after they deactivate their accounts .
The in - depth investigation began when students at the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic at the University of Ottawa filed a complaint to the privacy commissioner identifying potential problems with Facebook 's privacy policies and practices .
Stoddart had also criticized Facebook for sharing user information with third - party software developers - almost a million around the world - who create the popular applications like quizzes and games .
Facebook has agreed to retrofit its application platform so that developers cannot obtain any personal information without express consent from users for each of the categories it wants to access .
The company will also make it clear to users wishing to close their accounts that they have the choice between deactivation - which will allow Facebook to keep information on file - and deletion , which will erase all personal information from its database .
It will also update its privacy policy so that users can provide " meaningful consent " to letting Facebook keep their profile pages up after they die so that friends can post comments and pay tribute .
It will also include more information about the privacy of non-users .
Stoddart said her report showed it is possible to protect privacy online .
" Our investigation has demonstrated that our law is pragmatic and it works for something as new as social networking , " Stoddart said .
She added that users must remember they are ultimately responsible for protecting their own privacy and urged them to read policies before signing up .
" Users must constantly bear in mind that once something is online , it 's there for eternity , " she said .

Air Forest is a temporary public pavilion installed in City Park , Denver , Colorado , USA , for Dialog : City , an arts and cultural event during the Democratic National Convention 2008 .

Located in east - central Denver , City Park is the largest and most notable park in Denver .
This historic 1.3 km2 park has large open grass fields with Ferril Lake in its center , with a ring of trees all around the lake and the park ’s perimeter .
There is a main east - west axis that crosses the lake , starting from the Denver Museum of Nature and Science on the lake ’s eastern edge ( at the park ’s highest elevation ) to the landmark boat pavilion to the west on the other side of the lake , past which one can see the Denver skyline and the mountains beyond .
The ring of trees becomes disconnected at this axis on both sides of the lake , to provide a vantage point .

Denver Office of Cultural Affairs had hosted an event called Dialog : City , an arts and cultural event for the public , inspired on the occasion of the city of Denver hosting the National Democratic Convention 2008 .
The event invited 10 artists and architects to design or exhibit site - specific projects at various locations of the city , for the public to converge and spark dialogue across the city through innovative cultural initiatives , during the period of 24th to 30th August .
Our invitation was to create a temporary public space to be utilized in a vast array of scheduled events ( such as the Yoga Health Festival , a cocktail party for the convention , a high school play , Dialog : City closing party ) as well as for the general public to enjoy .

Air Forest is a 56.3 m long , 25 m wide pneumatic structure , composed of 9 hexagonal canopy units , at 4 m height .
These units are interconnected as one large piece of fabric , which are then inflated from the 14 blowers that are located at the base inside its 35 columns .
These columns are 5 m apart , and are weighed down by dirt and lighting elements which are also inside the columns , which light up at night and provide a public space after dark as well .
6 each of these pneumatic columns form a unit as they are connected in a hexagonal manner creating a circular opening from their inside perimeter .
Out of the 9 total hexagonal units formed , 3 of them are left open - air while the remaining 6 have vortex - shaped meshes that hang from them , providing shades for the public from the harsh sunlight .
The nylon fabric is coated with a gradient of silver dots , whose reflective surface mimics the colors of its surrounding environment , as well as providing a playful dotted shadow on the people under the structure .

The Air Forest is situated on the western edge of the Ferril Lake along the main axis .
Being at one of the two disconnected open gaps of the ring of forests , this synthetic structure seems to be a continuation of the forest that bridges this gap .
The structure also acts as a giant device to measure the site ’s conditions .
Not only does it sway gently with the wind , it also acts as a barometer , since the installation becomes structurally weaker ( and thus affected by the wind more ) as the air pressure drops due to cooler weather or even after sunset .
A picture may be worth a thousand words , but the photograph taken in 1933 of a brown - skinned boy wearing a swastika in a schoolyard in Hamburg , Germany , does not begin to tell the story of the remarkable life of Hans J. Massaquoi .
Mr. Massaquoi , former managing editor of Ebony magazine , has now told the story himself in his new book , Destined to Witness : Growing Up Black in Nazi Germany .
" When I first heard about the book , I stopped in my tracks , " said Yvonne Poser , associate professor of German at Howard University , who interviewed Mr. Massaquoi in the Pickford Theater on Feb. 16 as part of the Library 's African American History Month program .
" His is a victim 's story that had yet to be told . "
The question of how Massaquoi came to be raised in Nazi Germany is one he has been asked " millions of times . "
Grandson of the Liberian consul general to Hamburg , Mr. Massaquoi was born in 1926 to a well - to - do African father and a German mother .
His early life was one of privilege , befitting the grandson of a diplomat .
" I associated black skin with superiority , since our servants were white , " said Mr. Massaquoi .
" My grandfather was ' the man , ' " he joked .
His circumstances changed dramatically when his father and grandfather returned to Liberia in 1929 .
Refusing to expose her sickly son to a tropical climate , Mr. Massaquoi 's mother chose instead to raise her son in Germany as best she could on her meager wages as a nurse 's aide .
Although he had spent his early years in a villa , Mr. Massaquoi at first found life in a cold - water flat " interesting . "
What distressed him most was being the " oddity on the block . "
" It was a constant problem , " he said .
" I was always pointed at because of my exotic looks .
I just wanted to be like everyone else . "
Like other boys , he wanted nothing more than to join the Hitlerjugend ( Hitler Youth Movement ) .
" The Nazis put on the best show of all the political parties .
There were parades , fireworks and uniforms — these were the devices by which Hitler won over young people to his ideas .
Hitler always boasted that despite parents ' political persuasion , Germany 's youth belonged to him . "
Mr. Massaquoi was dealt a crushing blow when he learned that the Hitlerjugend as well as the local playground were not open to " non-Aryans . "
Two events that occurred during the summer of 1936 gave him " a genuine pride in my African heritage at a time when such pride was extremely difficult to come by . "
Two young black American athletes , boxer Joe Louis and Olympic runner Jesse Owens , dominated the news .
Mr. Massaquoi initially supported Germany 's Max Schmeling , who was scheduled to fight Louis but quickly switched his allegiance to " the Brown Bomber " in the wake of racist remarks attributed to Schmeling .
His classmates had taken to calling him " Joe , " which gave him welcomed prestige .
" I think I was more crushed than Louis when he lost to Schmeling , " joked Mr. Massaquoi .
In a rematch several months later , Louis knocked out Schmeling in the first round .
Mr. Massaquoi took similar pride in Jesse Owens 's now legendary performance at the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin .
He had the good fortune to be included when the father of one of his classmates took a group of boys to the games .
The triumph of a " non-Aryan " over German athletes was not what Hitler hoped to capture on film when he commissioned German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl to make a documentary of the Olympic games .
Years later , while working as a journalist , Mr. Massaquoi met Owens and Louis and thanked them " for allowing me to walk a little taller among my peers that summer . "
As he grew to adulthood , Mr. Massaquoi was barred from joining the German military , pursuing an education or a preparing for a professional career .
Instead he became a machinist 's apprentice .
After World War II , he immigrated to the United States on a student visa .
Although not a citizen , he was ordered to report for military service because of a clerical error and served for two years as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborn Division during the Korean War .
He subsequently took advantage of the GI bill and earned a degree in journalism from the University of Illinois , which paved the way for a nearly 40 - year career at Ebony magazine .
Asked how he survived Hitler 's reign of terror , Mr. Massaquoi credits two factors .
The fact that there were so few blacks in Germany at the time made them a low priority for mass extermination .
Additionally , the rapid advance of the allied troops gave Hitler " more to worry about than Hans Massaquoi . "
What does he think about Germany today ?
" I love it .
It 's my homeland . "
His opinion of Joerg Haider , the newly elected leader of Austria 's right - wing Freedom Party whose views have been likened to the Nazis , is far different : " He must be repudiated .
The whole world must show that we wo n't tolerate this type of ideology . "
( Mr. Haider has since resigned as his party 's chairman . )

And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee " Pulp Fiction - 1994
Where is the outrage ?
For someone who 's responded with rage and venom to an endless stream of ethics complaints and any other perceived slight , Sarah Palin 's silence about a reported affair she had speaks volumes .
While still married to her husband Todd , Sarah had and extramarital affair with Todd 's former business partner , Brad Hanson , according to the National Enquirer .
The Enquirer is the same paper that caught politico John Edwards cheating .
Where are the threats of libel from Palin 's lawyer Thomas Van Flein ?
Or her right - hand - man Meghan Stapleton with an iconic reply ?
And why is her proud - to - be - called pimp / talk show host / Palin apologist / official Palin emcee Eddie Burke , avoiding the story ?
No Palin topic has ever been off - limits to him .
Evidently until now .
I 'll tell you where the threats are , hiding in a closet with a few other skeletons in Wasilla .

The latest edition of Famitsu Wave recently hit the newsstands in Japan , with it comes a DVD which contains an 8 - minute exposé on Square Enix ’s second attempt at the MMO genre , Final Fantasy XIV .
The whole video is posted after the break .
Here ’s some of the juicy excerpts :
The game features a reinvented character progression system which does not include experience points or leveling up .
The job system from XI will make an appearance , but in a extremly altered form , also a interview with the game ’s director , Nobuaki Komoto , revealed that the game will place a focus on the weapons players use , explaining that your armaments will determine “ the way you play ” and “ the way you grow . ”
Sounds kinda reminiscent of Final Fantasy IX .
Furthermore , FFXIV producer Hiromichi Tanaka explained that the game takes place in a new region with a more “ modern ” feel to it , the mysterious Eorzea which was mentioned in the trailer .
The new world features familiar race but with some new names , and plays host to a “ deep story , ” which is told through cut - scenes and quests .

Jerry Springer is baffled his U.S. TV show has stayed on air so long - because it is " awful " .
The 65 year old has hosted The Jerry Springer Show since its debut in 1991 - but he 's mystified as to why viewers are so hooked .
He says , " We 've been doing this show for 19 years now and I 'm really sorry for that .
No one had any idea that it would last all these years . "
And Springer can't help but cringe when he watches back his very first episode : " That was pretty pathetic but it 's not as if it 's got any better , it 's still awful . "

Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Chinese archeologists have renewed investigation at the late Miocene hominoid digs in Yunnan , southwest China , according to archeologists at the the international anthropology forum here Thursday .
" We wanted to recover additional fossil hominoids and obtain further detailed information on their paleontological , geological , and paleoecological contexts , " said Ji Xueping , an archeologist from the Department of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology , Yunnan Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology , on the sideline of an international forum on anthropology Thursday .
Up till now , late Miocene and Pliocene hominoids have been recovered from four sites in Yunnan .
One of the most prolific of these dig sites is Leilao in the Yuanmou basin , 110 kilometers northwest of Kunming , capital of Yunnan .
More than 300 hominoid specimens have been recovered at Leilao belonging to Lufengpithecus and Yuanmoupithecus , two generations of the extinct apes dating eight million to two million years ago , Ji said .
The evolutionary position of Lufengpithecus has been contentious among archeologists .
Some suggest that Lufengpithecus is a primitive hominid while others believe it to bear affinities to Ponginae , a primate .
" We tend to favor that Lufengpithecus is a primitive Ponginae , " Ji said , adding that they are doing more comprehensive comparative analysis to substantiate their conclusion .
" It is still under debate and there is no final conclusion yet . "
Ji is working on the study with anthropology professor Terry Harrison from the Center for the Study of Human Origins and his colleague Zheng Liang .
Hominoids at Leilao were first discovered in 1990 by a group of Chinese archeologists and excavations were carried out in 1999 .
The digs unearthed nearly a hundred hominoid teeth and two mandibular fragments .
Renewed excavations were conducted at Dashuqingliangzi near Leilao and at Liujianfang near Leiyi , about 1.5 km northwest of Leilao from December 2006 , he said .
The collection obtained includes 99 specimens of Lufengpithecus and two specimens of Yuanmoupithecus .
The fossil apes recovered in Yunnan provide an important perspective on the evolutionary history of hominoids .
Their continued occurrence during the late Miocene and Pliocene , when hominoids became extinct throughout the rest of Eurasia , suggests that southern China was an important refugium for hominoids .
Previous study by the team , led by Harrison , suggests the uplift of the Tibetan plateau and its impact on regional climate may have been an important contributing factor in isolating the hominoids geographically and ecologically .
They speculate that the changed climate condition in the mid-Pliocene , about 3 million years ago , and possibly the subsequent emergence of Homo may have caused the regional extinction of large hominoids in southern China and in mainland Southeast Asia .
" Our future excavations and collections at Leilao will focus on an improved understanding of the phylogenetic relationships , paleobiology , paleoecology and taphonomy of the fossil hominoids , " he said .

CVS Caremark says it is careful about patient data .
“ In very limited circumstances , we exchange aggregated , de-identified data with third parties to assist the health care community in understanding patient use of prescription medications with the goal of achieving better health outcomes , ” said Carolyn Castel , a company spokeswoman .
Selling data to drug manufacturers is still allowed , if patients ’ names are removed .
But the stimulus law tightens one of the biggest loopholes in the old privacy rules .
Pharmacy companies like Walgreens have been able to accept payments from drug makers to mail advice and reminders to customers to take their medications , without obtaining permission .
Under the new law , the subsidized marketing is still permitted but it can no longer promote drugs other than those the customer already buys .
The ban on marketing is even more strict in California , where Walgreens is fighting off a class - action lawsuit filed on behalf of customers who received the subsidized mailings before the state outlawed them in 2004 .
Michael Polzin , a Walgreens spokesman , defended the mailings as a cost - cutting measure .
“ Patients who fail to properly take their medication cost the U.S. health care system $ 177 billion a year , ” when they fall sick and need treatment , he said .
The data mining industry , meanwhile , is challenging laws in New Hampshire , Maine and Vermont that ban collecting and selling prescription information to drug makers , which use it to decide which doctors to market to .
The companies in the case , IMS Health and Verispan , now part of the private company SDI Health , said the identities of patients were removed .
“ At no time does SDI ever receive any identifiable patient information nor any means to identify any patient from the data we handle .
All data is de-identified prior to transmission to SDI , ” said Andrew Kress , chief executive of SDI .
Privacy advocates and a judge in the case argued that de-identified information could easily spin out of control .
“ This information quickly finds its way into other databases , including those of insurance carriers and pharmacy benefits managers , ” Judge Bruce M. Selya wrote in a federal appeals court decision upholding the New Hampshire law .
IN another big change , the stimulus law provides $ 19 billion to push doctors toward installing electronic records systems .
It is a milestone on the road toward President Obama ’s goal of digitizing all medical records within five years .
But digitization creates the potential for more abuses by hackers , as well as blackmail and insurance fraud .

Congo sues Norway for $ 500 BILLION dollars !
In the Republic of Congo , a surreal scenario is playing out : Two Norwegian citizens , Tjostolv Moland and Joshua French , have been jailed , apparently due to involvement in a murderscene in which an innocent cabdriver was killed .
The Republic of Congo claims the Norwegians killed the driver over a money dispute – the Norwegians claims they were nothing more than witnesses to the crime , perpetrated by unknown gunmen in the middle of the jungle .
In any event , the Republic of Congo is furious – and claims that the killing represents an attack on « the body and soul of Congo itself » .
And what does Congo think would be a good compenstation for such a hideous crime against the Conglonese people ?
According to the State Attorney of the Republic of Congo , a mere $ 500 BILLION dollars will suffice .
Norwegian media is present at the military tribunal hearings , and reports that the demand was put forth today .
The Conglonese State Attorney insists that the two backpackers are undercover Norwegian agents , backing up this brash claim by pointing out that the two Norwegians were in fact equipped with – gasp !
– Norwegian drivers licenses at the time of their arrest .
As such – Congo claims – the state of Norway is morally and economically responsible for any and all wrong - doings their citizens do abroad .
Even though Norway is one of the richest countries in the world , enjoying the second highest GDP per-capita ( after Luxembourg ) , even Disney ’s Scrooge McDuck would have a hard time settling a $ 500 billion dollar debt .
If Congo wins forth in their own military tribunal , God help Norway .

We spent most of Monday reporting on these tea - bagging crowds going to Democratic health care town hall meetings to shout down the hosts and shut the events down .
It ’s classic agitprop , very akin to the ‘ Brooks Brothers riot ’ down in Florida during the recount .
But where ’s the other team ?
Folks can whine on endlessly about outfits like Freedom Works putting these rackets together .
But if the president ’s plan has any public support they should be able to get supporters to these events too , right ?
Not to pull the Black Shirt routine but to provide some public demonstration that there ’s real public support for making reform a reality .
If there is .
So that ’s the question .
Where ’s the other team ?
This year and the next few are shaping up to be banner years , historically speaking , and I 'm not referring to either the economy or the new administration in the White House .
First the Watchmen movie , which feels like it's been in the works since before the comic books were published , is about to actually hit the big screen ; and now there 's word that the even longer - awaited sequel to The Dark Crystal is going to be a reality !
Yes , despite rumors , promises , more rumors , etc. , over the years , the blog Muppet News Flash is reporting that there 's a script in place and production is beginning to actually , well , be produced .
Craig Pearce , the screenwriter of Strictly Ballroom , Romeo + Juliet , and Moulin Rouge ! , wrote the script for the sequel , which means he 's at least competent .
The Jim Henson Company is partnering with Omnilab Media to make the film , which should excite fans of the late TV show " Farscape , " as that 's the same partnership that was behind the show .
The bad news is that the sequel , titled ( at least for now ) Power of the Dark Crystal , wo n't be in theaters until 2011 , and I would n't be a bit surprised to see that slip a year .
So do n't make plans to go see it just yet , but keep a little anticipation loop running in the back of your mind , because it looks like it 's really going to happen .
I figure I 've been hoping for a sequel since I was 9 ( when the original was in theaters ) , so I can wait a little bit longer .
Now if they can just get Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie together again to make a Labyrinth sequel ( either based on the manga or not ) , I 'll be ecstatic .
( Incidentally , if you have n't seen the original Dark Crystal since you were a kid , rent or buy the DVD and watch it again .
You 'll see tons of cool little things you missed when you were young .
Trust me . )

Hip lenses for new outlook on life
Posted
Aug 27 - A California inventor is marketing what he calls a breakthrough design in glasses for those in the over - 40 crowd who are forced to wear bi-focals or progressive lenses .
LOS ANGELES 
A panel of federal judges ordered the California prison system on Tuesday to reduce its inmate population of 150,000 by 40,000  roughly 27 percent  within two years .
The judges said that reducing prison crowding in California was the only way to change what they called an unconstitutional prison health care system that causes one unnecessary death a week .
In a scathing 184 - page order , the judges said state officials had failed to comply with previous orders to fix the prison health care system and reduce crowding .
The judges left it to state officials to come up with a specific plan within 45 days , saying there was “ no need for the state to release presently incarcerated inmates indiscriminately in order to comply with our order . ”
They recommended remedies including imprisoning fewer nonviolent criminals and reducing the number of technical parole violators .
A Mind for Music
Posted : June 30 , 2009
NARRATOR : The well - known writer and neurologist , Oliver Sacks , is exploring the idea of how the brain reacts to music .
He is trying to figure out why some brains can't decode music at all while others are sensitive to the slightest musical nuance .
OLIVER SACKS :
In general , I 'm a Bach lover and have always been .
You know , even when I was a kid — when I was five — I'm told that I was asked what my favorite things in the world were and I said smoked salmon and Bach and , seventy years later , it 's still pretty much the same .
NARRATOR : In his quest , Dr. Sacks is offering himself up as a test subject .
A team of neuroscientists at Columbia University have designed a test that will reveal if the brain of Dr. Sacks loves Bach as much as he does .
Hal Hinkle gives Dr. Sacks a device to rate his emotions , while at the same time a scanner will record the activity of his brain .
He 'll hear two pieces of music : one by Bach and one by Beethoven .
First the Bach .
Then the Beethoven .
The composers are different , but the music shares certain qualities .
HAL HINKLE : Oliver , that completes the first emotional scan .
I would like to hear how that was for you .
OLIVER SACKS : The Bach sort of blew me away , especially that point where the soprano came in and there was a wonderful harmonic modulation .
But the Beethoven I 'm afraid sort of left me flat .
NARRATOR : The results of the scan , amazingly , seem to confirm his feelings .
JOY HIRSCH ( Columbia University Medical Center ) :
What you can see just in an immediate overview here is that this is your Bach brain and this is your Beethoven brain .
OLIVER SACKS : Sorry , Ludwig .
JOY HIRSCH : Yeah , sorry Ludwig .
There 's not much there .
NARRATOR : Bach clearly excited much of his brain , including the many regions essential to appreciating the complexity of music .
But unlike Beethoven , Bach activated the amygdala , which is vital to processing emotions .
JOY HIRSCH :
Here we see large activity associated with the right amygdala when you 're listening to Bach .
There is none of that when you 're listening this very comparable piece in Beethoven .
NARRATOR : But during another part of the test , Dr. Sacks was unable to distinguish Bach from Beethoven .
HAL HINKLE : Ah , again , we 'd like to hear what your response was to it .
OLIVER SACKS : Well , I 'm sort of confused .
I could hardly differentiate Bach from Beethoven and neither seemed to move me very much .
NARRATOR : But his brain tells a different story .
HAL HINKLE :
The remarkable finding for you was even when you might have thought it was Beethoven ...
OLIVER SACKS : Even when I was confused ...
HAL HINKLE : Your brain can tell Bach from Beethoven .
NARRATOR : Dr. Sacks clearly favors Bach over Beethoven .
Even when he could n't tell them apart , the brain scan on the left still shows increased activity .
So , in fact , his brain recognizes the difference and makes its preference clear .
OLIVER SACKS :
So my brain knows even when I do n't .
JOY HIRSCH : That 's the conclusion .
You 're brain can distinguish them even when you do n't .
The 96th Tour de France cycling race is currently underway , with the final , 21st stage of the 3,445 km ( 2,141 mi ) race coming up on Sunday , July 26th .
At this time , Alberto Contado of Kazakh team Astana appears to be headed toward a second tour title , currently leading riders Andy Schleck of Team Saxo Bank and Luxembourg and , in 3rd place , Lance Armstrong , also of team Astana .

Chromium , the open source software project behind Google 's Chrome Web browser , has gained native compatibility for 64 - bit systems .
This reflects the growing maturity of the Linux port and demonstrates the extent of Google 's commitment to make Chrome a first - class citizen on the platform .
In a message posted to the Chromium developer list late last week , Google software engineer Dean McNamee revealed that 64 - bit compatibility had been achieved and that official builds could be coming soon .
He also posted a link to a page at the Chromium wiki which provides simple compilation instructions .
" The v8 team did some amazing work this quarter building a working 64 - bit port .
After a handful of changes on the Chromium side , I 've had Chromium Linux building on 64 - bit for the last few weeks , " he wrote .
" I believe mmoss or tony is going to get a buildbot running , and working on packaging . "
McNamee also points out that unofficial 64 - bit Chromium builds are available for Ubuntu users in the Chromium Daily Build Personal Package Archive ( PPA ) which is maintained by Ubuntu contributor Fabien Tassin .
Users can add that PPA to their APT sources list to get Chromium packages that are updated daily from the latest code .
The daily builds are highly experimental and are obviously not intended for regular users , but they provide a very convenient and effective way to keep track of the latest improvements to the browser .
On 64 - bit Ubuntu systems , the Chromium packages previously depended on ia32 - libs .
Now that the browser can be built natively for 64 - bit systems , it no longer has that requirement .
Chromium popularity on Linux
Canonical External Developer Relations manager Jorge Castro ( a former Ars contributor ) recently posted a blog entry about the growing popularity of Ubuntu daily builds .
He points to the statistics generated by the Ubuntu Popularity Contest ( Popcon ) which indicate that over 10,000 Ubuntu users have installed the Chromium package .
It 's important to note that Popcon is an optional opt - in service , so the total number could actually be far in excess of 10,000 users .
Google 's
Web browser has clearly attracted a significant amount of attention in the Linux community despite the fact that the Linux port is still a work in progress and is n't ready for mainstream use yet .
Google 's strong effort to make Chrome shine on Linux is being recognized by the community , and the browser is increasingly viewed as a compelling competitor to Firefox , the dominant Linux Web browser .
It 's disgusting how much better British TV - news is than USA TV - news .
Anyway , good postI 'm glad somebody out there is calling GS a bunch of crooks .
Too bad you 'll never hear that on an American station
What Palin Said :
The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama 's " death panel " so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their " level of productivity in society , " whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil .
How Politico reported it :
Palin calls
Dems healthcare plan " evil , " cites threat to Trig Describing Democratic healthcare plans as " evil , " Sarah Palin is warning that the proposals being debated in Washington could threaten the life of Trig , her Down Syndrome infant boy .
Palin , in her first policy statement since resigning as Alaska governor , wrote on her Facebook page Friday afternoon that the sick , elderly and disabled would suffer should healthcare be rationed , as conservatives claim it will with a public option . [...]
Seriously ?
Seriously ?
Yes , seriously .
It falls to Politico to take a story about a national figure making up wholesale a crooked and ridiculous story about how Democratic " Death Panels " are coming after her disabled child if we dare reform healthcare , and turn it into an absolutely straight news story .
Well done , Politico .
Absolutely masterful .
I could n't come up with a more embarrassing example of the national political media as lazy , stupid , worse - than - useless prop if I tried .
I think there should be such a thing as an anti-Pulitzer .
There should be an award for the reporter or reporters that most willfully ignore the basic falsehood of a story -- something like " fire is cold " , or " if you shoot yourself in the head , M& M 's will come out " or " if we reform our nation 's healthcare , the President will send a Death Panel to murder my disabled son " -- and instead treat as if it was a debatable point worth reporting as fact .
You have to really , really try , in order to take a story so asinine and report it with such studious credulity .
Well freakin ' done .
Under our current MONETARY system it does .
But healthcare is a neccessity , so I do n’t mind if we go in debt for THAT .
But , why go into debt ?
American Credit system ( A. Hamilton ) would solve most of that .
Or we can keep with our current one , and just kill ourselves through lack of healthcare ?
Especailly if no one is employed , who is providing the healthcare ?
Why choose either / or when you can have both ?
That really is the choice we ’re making .
Keep our current system , deny heathcare and social services to as many as possible in the hopes things will turn around , and that spending money on this is what is killing us .
Wrong .
Spending money on this can help kill THIS SYSTEM , but it ’s already dead anyways .
This would just quicken it .
( which would be a GOOD thing ) .
Meanwhile you then can call yourself an honorable person , and actually be correct .
Funny thing this debt based monetary system .
Things keep getting worse , which cause ‘ the people ’ to request ever increasing help from the gov’t .
You could deny them , save money , keep the system , and be screwed in the end .
You could give them services , spend that extra few percentage points , keep the system , and be screwed in the end .
Which way is better ?
At least the 2nd way you make people ’s lives better .
But I ’d rather have option 3 .
Give services , spend the extra points which will give us a real inflation less probalby 1/5 of the monetary inflation we currently get nothing for , ditch the system , and everyone who tries has a chance to prosper .
That ’s the prospect of the American Credit System .
The one we started with , the one we built everything from .
That , and a commitment to continuous infrastructure improvement , and a few more technical things .
We ’ve been watching the implosion for 40 years .
But only in the past 2 have things become apparent .
Even then , not to many , even after last fall .
What will they do after this year ’s crash ?
Will they continue to bury their heads ?
Maybe not .
But they will still try to save the system .
At what point does the average person demand a switch of the system ?
AFTER it crushes everyone , or can we agree that the trend is real and ACT AS IF it is going to crush everyone , before it crushes them .
Because if the system is n’t fixed ( and it ca n’t be ) then it ’s going to crush them .
But everyone here has the light on , so I ’m sure I ’m just preaching to the choir about most of this .
ARLINGTON , Virginia ( CNN ) --
American children are n't necessarily getting smarter or dumber , but that might not be good enough to compete globally , according to numbers cited Tuesday by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan .
The National Center for Education Statistics found U.S. students placed below average in math and science .
He noted a special analysis put out last week by the National Center for Education Statistics that compares 15 - year - old U.S. students with students from other countries in the Organization for Economic Development .
It found the U.S. students placed below average in math and science .
In math , U.S. high schoolers were in the bottom quarter of the countries that participated , trailing countries including Finland , China and Estonia .
According to the report , the U.S. math scores were not measurably different in 2006 from the previous scores in 2003 .
But while other countries have improved , the United States has remained stagnant .
In science , the United States falls behind countries such as Canada , Japan and the Czech Republic .
Duncan told a room full of science and math experts of the National Science Board on Tuesday morning that this will hurt the United States as it competes internationally .
" We are lagging the rest of the world , and we are lagging it in pretty substantial ways , " he said .
" I think we have become complacent .
We 've sort of lost our way . "
He acknowledged that in some areas of the United States it is hard to find good math and science teachers .
To solve that problem , he said , " I think we should pay math and science teachers a lot more money .
We pay everybody the same .
We have areas of critical need -- math , science , foreign language , special education in some places .
I think we need to pay a premium for that . "
The National Education Association , which represents teachers , argues against such a proposal .
" Simply being a teacher of a hard - to - staff subject does not equate with effective instruction , and therefore , should not be rewarded in - and - of - itself through a salary differential , " the organization says in a position statement .
The fourth - and eighth - graders who were part of the mathematics testing have improved their average scores compared with their European counterparts , but they still lag behind their Asian peers in China , Hong Kong , Japan , Korea and Singapore .
In science , fourth - graders have fallen behind other students even though their average scores remained about the same .
The eighth - graders ' scores remain about the same compared to 1995 .
" It has huge implications , " Duncan said .
" I think as a real economic imperative we have to educate our way to a better economy . "

Tips : I did it severall times and had problems to create the many bubbles I saw in India ...
Solved by adding a 1/ 2 teaspoon of baking soda and putting a lid on the pan ...
Do this and bubles will pop out everywhere and the bread will melt in your mouth ...

Rating : 5 stars Absolutely better than the Naan served in my favorite local Indian restaurant .
A couple of comments to clarify the recipe instructions , however : " Proofing " the yeast means that you must add about 1 Tblsp . of sugar to the warm water and yeast , then allow to double in volume prior to adding any further ingredients ( I might not have known that had I not stumbled upon proofing instructions on the package ) .
Also , I found that it took a considerable amount of time for this dough to rise , so keep that in mind when you are planning for this to accompany a meal .
High heat was way too extreme a cooking temperature .
I burned the first few and ended up keeping the heat on medium - low .
This recipe had a wonderful flavor , and you could truly eat them alone with nothing more than a little butter .
Tasty !

Rating : 5 stars I have mostly forgotten was naan tastes like , but this was relatively similar .
As I live in an off - campus apartment , I did n't have access to a real grill , so I tried the following : 1 . Cooking it on an open George Foreman Grill 2 .
Cooking it on it closed .
3 . Cooking on a grill pan in the oven .
4 . Grilling it in a toaster oven .
The opened George Foreman was best .
And another tip : Do n't knead in the minced garlic .
Add it to the hot melted butter and let it soak in for 10 minutes or so .
Then apply the butter - it is delicious , and you do n't have chunks of pungent garlic in some bits and not others .
I halved the recipe .

This was fantastic !
I made it in my bread machine on dough cycle , using only 3 1/2 cups of all purpose flour as recommended by others , then removed it , made the balls and let rise about 1 /2 hour .
The SECRET to getting them to bubble is - when pinching the balls , pinch half in each hand , put the two halves together and then make the ball .
Let rise , roll out and fry in butter .
One more thing .
I made these on a Monday and I had five balls left over so I put the raw dough in the fridge in a zip lock bag and four days later , just floured a board and rolled them out without even letting them come to room temoerature and they were just as good as the first time !
Served them with lamb curry the first time and pea soup the second .
I imagine that freezing them and letting them thaw would have the same results since there is so much frozen dough in the stores these days .
Mine were perfect !
Thank you for the recipe .
I have tried to make naan before with another recipe and it turned out heavy and blah .
Thanks again - my husband just raved .

Rating : 5 stars Greate Naan recipe !
My mom ( she 's Indian ) and I have tried making so many different Naan recipes , and this one turned out the best .
The trick to having it bubble up and not be tough and chewy is to roll it as thin as possible .
Then when cooking it on the grill only cook it until the grill marks get dark brown , do not let the whole Naan brown .
Aside from the grill marks , the rest of the Naan should still be white in color .
It 's the closest you 'll get to the Naan they serve in the Indian restaurants .
Thanks so much for posting this Mic ! Thumb Up Helpful ( 658 )

This recipe makes a delicious fry bread .
Some reviewers were disappointed in how long it took to rise .
You must PROOF your yeast , by adding 1T of sugar to the yeast and warm water .
Let sit for 9 - 12 minutes , then proceed with the remainder of the recipe .
My clothes dryer happened to be going at the same time , so I just stuck my bowl on top for warmth .
The dough came out absolutely fantastic .
I did half the recipe as stated , and since I had small children visiting , I did half as cinnamon - sugar fry bread .
Simply roll the bread in a mixture of cinnamon - sugar when its just out of the oven .
The kids loved it .
Medium low heat was best to avoid burn marks .

Very good , as stated before by others this is similar in quality to good indian restaurants .
I used my baking stone and set the my oven to 600 degrees rather than use the grill .
The baking stone helped to give it the tandoori oven taste .
The cooking time was considerably less though , taking about two minutes total , at most .
I tried both regular butter and ghee ( clarified butter ) and found the ghee imparted more of the restaurant taste .
Omitted the garlic .

Rating : 5 stars Really great recipe !!
I loved the taste of this bread because it 's so close to what 's served in some of my favorite Indian restaurants .
I omitted the garlic .
Instead of grilling , I cooked the naan in a large saute pan after I brushed both sides with melted butter .
Make sure you do n't add too much flour when you 're kneading , or the dough will be stiff .
Add just enough flour to have the dough just barely clean the sides of your mixing bowl .
If you 're having problems with the dough not rising ( maybe it 's not warm enough in your house ) , try putting it in a warm oven ( 200 F ) with the door open and covered with a damp towel .

My husband absolutely LOVED this Naan , he could n't get enough !!
I am Pakistani and we eat Naan quite frequently , this Naan had a very authentic taste .
For the longest time I had been trying to find a good Naan recipe and Im sooo happy !!
This is it !!!
The Naan comes out light and fluffy and just plain wonderful .

If you 're serious about avoiding cartel - level prices on ink cartridges , or even refilling services , you can convert a multi- color inkjet printer into a continuous inking model for serious long - term savings .

DIY bible MAKE 's blog points to an oldie - but - goodie tutorial from 2002 by Eddie Matejowsky .
His multi-page , in - depth tutorial explains how to convert the ink tanks in an Epson Stylus 760 to accept continuous ink refills , bought in bulk at serious discount , and how to piece together a custom circuit board that keeps the printer from demanding you hand over your credit card when the cartridges run " empty . "
Matejowsky 's project is not a one - hour lark , and it takes a few tools that semi - pro tinkerers may not have handy .
It can , however , be worked on other printers , as Hack n' Mod shows a Canon printer with continuous inking .
Commenters there also point out that you can meet your big savings halfway by buying a continuous inking kit for something close to $ 50 on sites like eBay .

Tell us whether you 'd ever attempt a total printer conversion like this to save money , or if you 've found another way to beat the printer cabal at the ink game , in the comments .

Before SimCity — even before Dungeons and Dragons — back when " computer " was a job title , people still found ways to vaporize countless hours of free time designing and maintaining private universes .
In the analog world , such parallel realities were built with tweezers , glue and a spouse ’s permission to cover the basement with papier - mâché massifs and plywood plains .
See also : Show Us Your Model Trains
Though it 's located just a short drive from the company that launched SimCity and Spore , the Walnut Creek Model Railroad Society has stuck by these venerable techniques and still makes believe the old - fashioned way .
Members operate one of the largest , exclusively HO scale train lines in the United States and have conducted at their current location since 1974 .
The society ’s control systems are a steampunk fantasy : a roomful of vintage 1930s magnetic relays once used to route phone calls , clacking like mechanical dominoes with every move the amateur engineers make .
A full complement of 30 members can run 10 individual trains simultaneously on the layout , though only a dozen or so are required for basic operation .
Read on , for a tour of this impressive train set and the machinery that makes it all work .
The layout for the Diablo Valley Lines — the members ' imaginary railroad company — is 54 feet by 32 feet .

The society ’s headquarters sits in a public park about a mile from the nearest full - sized train in the area — a drab regional people - mover that looks like it was created specifically to purge all romance from rail travel .
Resembling the backdrop for an Office Space sequel , the location might make a casual visitor wonder if he were in the right place , until he sees the yellow sandwich board emblazoned with the Monopoly - esque silhouette of a steam engine .
Society member Ken Bechtle traces his affinity for the railroad to a childhood fascination .
" My mother found me , " he relates , " at the Southern Pacific Rail Yards in Sacramento when I was 2 - years old … .
I guess I snuck out and went down there . "
A fan of the HO scale since 1946 , Bechtle acts as the society ’s " Trainmaster , " wrangling teams of club members to guide locomotives through the society ’s 1,800 - square - foot diorama , called a layout in the parlance of model railroaders .

Nearly a mile of track winds through the layout ’s miniature landscapes and tiny towns , featuring replicas of a wide variety of structures and scenery .
Craggy yellow hills , made of wood and wire mesh , rise well above eye level .
Though the terrain is not modeled on any place in particular , its dusky hues evoke what member Ted Moreland calls " freelance western railroad . "
Because they were in a hurry to get the setup presentable to the public , a lot of the scenery that was put out in the early days of the club is still on the Diablo Valley Line .
The club has been going back in recent years and redoing some of those scenes .

The layout dominates the main room of the two - story clubhouse that society members purpose - built back in 1972 .
" The pouring and the finishing of the concrete slab was contracted out , " says Bechtle , " but the rest of the building … was done by the members , other than main center beam , and a neighbor volunteered a forklift to put it up . "
One of the model towns on the layout is still called " Olympia " in honor of the budget beer that helped fuel the construction .
With its high ceilings , windowless walls and spot lighting , the inside of the building feels a bit like a truncated sports arena .
One side is overlooked by a utilitarian press box filled with engineers , each controlling a single locomotive , while on the opposite wall a giant schematic of the rail lines , complete with a scoreboard - style lighting system , indicates the location and direction of each active train .
From a darkened dugout on the main floor , a dispatcher routes the traffic through the 400 - plus switches and turnouts of the Diablo Valley Lines .

Bechtle ( not pictured ) worked for the phone company back when magnetic relays were still used to route phone calls , and he rigged the relays for model trains and bundled masses of wire complicated enough to induce a headache on sight .
A less detail - oriented type would probably go mad keeping track of thickets of wire so tangled they look almost comical , but Bechtle clearly relishes his role as the man behind the scenes of a complex project .

All members of the crew communicate via headsets of the kind favored by NFL coaches , and most are clad in denim work shirts embroidered with a logo for the Diablo Valley Lines .
The gray - haired hobbyists focus on the tasks at hand , immersing themselves in their railroad roles and tuning out the parents and kids looking on .
A sign on the wall reads " Children Left Unattended Will Be Given Sugar and a Free Puppy , " making clear that the railroaders are not motivated by a desire to entertain the younger generation .
The result is a giant , live - action role - playing game where the players invent passenger routes with elaborate timetables and plot delivery schedules for imaginary freight cargoes .
" You ca n’t relax at all , " Moreland says .
" You ’ve got to pay attention , think ahead ...
It ’s just like the real railroad . "
Trying to coax a train operator into conversation as he runs his route evokes the disdain you ’d get for asking a Dungeon Master about his day job : a wince , a wave of the hand , then a look of concentration as he forces his way back into the realm of imagination .
To fully staff the Diablo Valley Lines and keep things running smoothly , the club needs 25 members .
The members ' ages range from 14 to 88 .
If you count all the engines the club owns and all the ones owned by members , they could pull 1,000 separate trains .
Photos : Jim Merithew
The club has designed a lighting and sound system that cycles through all hours of the day , including a lightning storm that strikes in the middle of the night .
Like the trains themselves , timekeeping inside the clubhouse is also in miniature , and " night " occurs every hour or so , accompanied by the sound of thunder and , at least when the public is around , the opening bars of Richard Strauss ' Thus Spake Zarathustra .
Photos : Jim Merithew
Each scene of the layout is full of detail and imagination .
Off to one side , a small port boasts a working bascule drawbridge , and a warehouse with the dimensions of a roll - on suitcase bears a lighted sign for " I.C. Sparks Welding Supplies . "
In front of a nearby building , figurines hoist chad - sized picket signs demanding higher wages , while an airplane lolls in lazy circles overhead , suspended from a trapeze of piano wire .
Ted Moreland , of nearby Pittsburg , holds his Union Pacific CA1 caboose .

The trains , buildings and scenery on the layout are all in HO scale , with a ratio of 1:87 to their real - world counterparts .
The highest point is equivalent to a 1,350 - foot mountain , bolstering the society ’s claim that its layout has the greatest elevation of any in the country .
No one is sure how long it took to put together the landscape and the models that populate it , though society members playfully suggest a figure of about a million hours .
The club actually lays railroad ties this size by hand , using railroad spikes like this .

It is no surprise that Spacewar , often described as the world ’s first computer game , was the handiwork of members of MIT ’s Tech Model Railroad Club who were devotees of the most elaborate fantasy world available in the analog era .
In some ways the rise of computer games , which allow users to instantly enter an alternate reality , has challenged the relevance of model railroading .
Yet for the members of the Walnut Creek Model Railroad Society , escapism is best when built by hand .
Will Wright would definitely approve .

English [ edit ]
Etymology [ edit ]
Attested since 1922 , of unclear origin . [ 1 ]
There are several suggested origins , but it most likely arose in imitation of the numerous animal - related nonsense phrases popular in the 1920s such as the cat 's pyjamas , cat 's whiskers , cat 's meow , gnat 's elbow , monkey 's eyebrows etc . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
A popular folk etymology has the phrase referring to the world champion dancer Bee Jackson .
[ 5 ]
Another suggestion is that the phrase is a corruption of business [ 4 ] [ 6 ] but this may be a back - formation .
The singular bee 's knee is attested from the late 18th century meaning something small or insignificant in the phrase big as a bee 's knee .
Also as weak as a bee 's knee is attested in Ireland ( 1870 ) .
It is possible that the bee 's knees is a deliberate inversion of this meaning but is not attested . [ 6 ]

[ This is a rough unedited crib of the actual talk ]
Citation : boyd , danah .
2009 .
" The Not - So - Hidden Politics of Class Online . "
Personal Democracy Forum , New York , June 30 .
This talk was written for a specific audience - the attendees of the Personal Democracy Forum .
This audience is primarily American , primarily liberal - leaning , primarily white , and primarily involved professionally in politics in one way or another .
Keep this audience in mind when I 'm talking about " we " here .
Good morning !
Many of us in this room have had our lives transformed by technology .
Some of us have grown up with tech while others have embraced it as adults .
Many of us have become enamored with tech and its transformative potential .
And because of this , many of us have become technology advocates .
We 've worked our way into different institutions , preaching about new opportunities introduced because of the internet .
Furthermore , many in this room have been active in transforming politics through technology .
We 've leveraged technology for fundraising and getting out the vote .
We could go on and on about political events that have been shaped by technology , from the Obama Campaign to the post-election Iranian protests .
All of this is brilliant and powerful , exciting and motivating .
But I 'm also worried .
I 'm worried about the rhetoric we use when we talk about technology .
Given what we 've experienced and what we witness today , we tend to believe that these technologies are the great equalizers , that they can help ANYONE participate , that the technologies in and of themselves can revitalize democracy .
In other words , we tend to believe in a certain utopian myth of the internet as the savior .
What if this were n't true ?
There 's nothing more tricky than standing up in front of a room full of people passionate about transforming society at a conference on big ideas and asking you to do a privilege check , but I 'm going to do so anyhow because I 'm a masochist .
More acutely , I think that we need to unpack what 's happening with technology in order to productively engage with the development of technology .
You need to understand the sticking points in order to move the needle in the right direction .
I want to ask a favor here today .
I want you to step away from the techno - hyperbole for just a moment and think about issues of inequality and social stratification with me .
I want you to think about the ways in which technology is not equally available or equally transformative .
For decades , we 've assumed that inequality in relation to technology has everything to do with " access " and that if we fix the access problem , all will be fine .
This is the grand narrative of concepts like the " digital divide . "
Yet , increasingly , we 're seeing people with similar levels of access engage in fundamentally different ways .
And we 're seeing a social media landscape where participation " choice " leads to a digital reproduction of social divisions .
This is most salient in the States which is intentionally the focus of my talk here today .
MySpace vs. Facebook
Rather than staying in land of abstract , let 's go concrete .
To do so , let 's deal directly with a very specific case study : MySpace vs. Facebook .
How many of you currently use Facebook ? [ 90 % + of the audience raises their hands . ]
How many of you currently use MySpace ?
[ A few lone figures raise their hands . ]
Look around .
Two weeks ago , comScore released numbers showing that Facebook and MySpace were neck - and - neck in terms of unique user visits in the U.S.
The meta-narrative was that Facebook was winning in the States and that MySpace was dying .
I would argue that the numbers can be read differently .
The numbers show that MySpace has neither grown nor faded in the last year while Facebook has expanded rapidly and has finally reached the same size .
Of course , this is not to say that Facebook is n't doing tremendously .
In a business environment where monetization is shaky , the only definition of success is " growth . "
Given that , it 's reasonable to see Facebook as more successful than MySpace this year .
But we still need to account for the fact that as many people visit MySpace as Facebook and that , as exemplified by the people in this room , that 's not because there 's a complete overlap of users .
Even if you think that Facebook is winning the game , we need to account for the fact that * 70 million * people in the US visited MySpace .
That 's not small potatoes .
As is the case in many situations , teenagers are a darn good indicator of broader trends .
I 'm an ethnographer .
For the last four years , I 've been traveling the United States , talking to American teenagers about their use of social media .
During the 2006 - 2007 school year , I started noticing a trend .
In each school , in each part of the country , there were teens who opted for MySpace and teens who opted for Facebook .
( There were also plenty of teens who used both . )
At the beginning of the school year , teens were asking " Are you on MySpace ?
Yes or No ? "
At the end of the school year , the question had transformed to " MySpace or Facebook ? "
Given this transformation , I started analyzing my data to understand the transition .
I also went back into the field to specifically talk to teens about the tensions between MySpace and Facebook .
What follows are quotes from my fieldwork .
In analyzing this data , one can reasonably see this as a matter of individual choice in a competitive market .
There are plenty of teenagers who will tell you that they are on one or the other as a matter of personal preference having to do with the features or functionality .
Jordan ( 15 , Austin ) : [ Facebook has ] unlimited pictures .
I like that .
Melanie ( 15 , Kansas ) : I leave a lot more comments on Facebook , just because that 's more what Facebook 's about more than MySpace .
Catalina ( 15 , Austin ) : [ Facebook ] does n’t take eight hours to load the page .
That really bothered me [ about MySpace ] .
There are also those who will talk about design and usability .
Anindita ( 17 , LA ) : Facebook ’s easier than MySpace but MySpace is more complex .
You can add things to it .
You can add music , make backgrounds and layouts , but Facebook is just plain white and that ’s it .
Heather ( 16 , Iowa ) :
It ’s much easier to use Facebook than MySpace .
MySpace is a little complicated .
You have to be in the network .
It ’s complicated and some people are just kind of too lazy to do that .
Teens will also talk about their perceptions of different sites , about what they think certain affordances mean or how they perceive the sites in relation to values they hold such as safety .
Cachi ( 18 , Iowa ) : Facebook is less competitive than MySpace .
It does n’t have the Top 8 thing or anything like that , or the background thing .
Tara ( 16 , Michigan ) : [ Facebook ] kind of seemed safer , but I do n't know like what would make it safer , like what main thing .
But like , I do n't know , it just seems like everything that people say , it seems safer .
And of course the dominant explanation teens will give to justify their choice has to do with their friends .
Simply put , they go where their friends are .
Kevin ( 15 , Seattle ) : I ’m not big on Facebook ; I ’m a MySpace guy .
I have a Facebook and I have some friends on it , but most of my friends do n’t check it that often so I do n’t check it that often .
Red ( 17 , Iowa ) : I am on Facebook and MySpace .
I do n’t talk to people on MySpace anymore … the only reason I still have my MySpace is because my brother ’s on there .
All of this would be fine and dandy if friendships and aesthetics and values were n't inherently intertwined with issues of race , socio- economic status , education , and other factors that usually make up our understanding of " class . "
But they are .
And the further into the analysis you go , the more uncomfortable the data might make you feel .
Kat ( 14 , Mass . ) :
I 'm not really into racism , but I think that MySpace now is more like ghetto or whatever , and Facebook is all ... not all the people that have Facebook are mature , but its supposed to be like oh we 're more mature .
…
MySpace is just old .
This quote provides the key to understanding the distinction between MySpace and Facebook .
Choice is n't about features of functionality .
It 's about the social categories in which we live .
It 's about choosing sites online that reflect " people like me . "
And it 's about seeing the " other " site as the place where the " other " people go .
Anastasia ( 17 , New York ) :
My school is divided into the ' honors kids , ' ( I think that is self - explanatory ) , the ' good not - so - honors kids , ' ' wangstas , ' ( they pretend to be tough and black but when you live in a suburb in Westchester you can't claim much hood ) , the ' latinos / hispanics , ' ( they tend to band together even though they could fit into any other groups ) and the ' emo kids ' ( whose lives are allllllways filled with woe ) .
We were all in MySpace with our own little social networks but when Facebook opened its doors to high schoolers , guess who moved and guess who stayed behind …
The first two groups were the first to go and then the ' wangstas ' split with half of them on Facebook and the rest on MySpace ...
I shifted with the rest of my school to Facebook and it became the place where the ' honors kids ' got together and discussed how they were procrastinating over their next AP English essay .
Teens - and adults - use social categories and labels to identify people with values , tastes , and social positions .
As teens chose between MySpace and Facebook , these sites took on the frames of those social categories .
Nowhere is this more visible than in the language that those who explicitly chose Facebook over MySpace .
Craig ( 17 , California ) :
The higher castes of high school moved to Facebook .
It was more cultured , and less cheesy .
The lower class usually were content to stick to MySpace .
Any high school student who has a Facebook will tell you that MySpace users are more likely to be barely educated and obnoxious .
Like Peet ’s is more cultured than Starbucks , and Jazz is more cultured than bubblegum pop , and like Macs are more cultured than PC’s , Facebook is of a cooler caliber than MySpace .
As adults began engaging with Facebook , another twist emerged around perceived maturity .
One thing to keep in mind ... there 's plenty of documentation about how teenagers from wealthier , more educated backgrounds are more willing to participate in environments alongside adults than those from poorer backgrounds .
Of course , this language has more to do with perception and values than actual co-participation .
Kaitlyn ( 14 , Georgia ) : Facebook is for old people .
Melanie ( 15 , Kansas ) : Facebook is way better .
MySpace is just boring , and it ’s still lame because you can still make the background like you ’re a little kid on Xanga , and Facebook is more like adultness .
In this example , note that Kaitlyn chooses MySpace in order to keep away from " old people " while Melanie embraces Facebook to engage with adult society .
In looking through my data , I found that teens who prefer Facebook are far more likely to be condescending towards those who use MySpace than vice versa .
Teens who use MySpace may lament teen Facebook users as " stuck - ups " or " goodie two - shoes " or the " good kids . "
But they 're not nearly as harsh in their language as Facebook users are of those who use MySpace .
Explanations
There are many potential explanations for how we got here .
One explanation comes from looking at the origin points .
Early adopters matter - they shape services in the long - term .
MySpace came out first and quickly attracted urban 20 - somethings .
It spread to teenagers through older siblings and cousins as well as those who were attracted to indie rock and hip hop music culture .
Facebook started at Harvard and spread to the Ivy Leagues before spreading more broadly .
The first teenagers to hear about Facebook were those connected to the early adopters of Facebook ( i.e. the Ivy League bound types ) .
The desirability of the site spread from those college - bound teens .
As word of these sites spread , teens went to where their friends were .
The origin points of these sites explain many of people 's choices , especially when it comes to first adoption because people adopt the sites that their friends adopt .
Yet , it does n't explain why people some people left MySpace to join Facebook and others did not .
One way of thinking about the transition from MySpace to Facebook is through the frame of fashion cycles and fads .
MySpace was first ; arguably , some people got sick of it and , when Facebook came along , voila !
This is certainly true for many teens ( and adults ) , but this explanation would only work if MySpace was dead or if users of MySpace thought of it as uncool .
The fact that MySpace is still quite popular among a certain segment of the population .
Only a month ago , I was doing fieldwork in Atlanta where I found heavy usage of MySpace among certain groups of youth .
They knew of Facebook but had no interest in leaving MySpace to join Facebook .
Herein lies the reality that makes all of this quite messy to deal with .
It was n't just anyone who left MySpace to go to Facebook .
In fact , if we want to get to the crux of what unfolded , we might as well face an uncomfortable reality ...
What happened was modern day " white flight . "
Whites were more likely to leave or choose Facebook .
The educated were more likely to leave or choose Facebook .
Those from wealthier backgrounds were more likely to leave or choose Facebook .
Those from the suburbs were more likely to leave or choose Facebook .
Those who deserted MySpace did so by " choice " but their decision to do so was wrapped up in their connections to others , in their belief that a more peaceful , quiet , less - public space would be more idyllic .
This dynamic was furthered by the press , an institution that stems from privilege and tends to reflect the lives of a more privileged class of people .
They narrated MySpace as the dangerous underbelly of the Internet while Facebook was the utopian savior .
And here we get back to Kat 's point : MySpace has become the " ghetto " of the digital landscape .
The people there are more likely to be brown or black and to have a set of values that terrifies white society .
And many of us have habitually crossed the street to avoid what is seen as the riff - raff .
The fact that digital migration is revealing the same social patterns as urban white flight should send warning signals to everyone out there .
And if we think back to the language used by teens who use Facebook when talking about MySpace , we should be truly alarmed .
Those who are from privileged backgrounds tend to be far more condescending towards those who are not than vice versa .
Many of us in this room come from privileged worlds where we want to " help " those who are not well - off .
Here is where a privilege - check is necessary .
How often do our language and mannerisms reflect a problematic level of condescension ?
Perhaps we should look at our teens .
They are certainly speaking in a manner that reveals distrust and condescension .
I highlight this because I think that we need to think twice when we dismiss or devalue popular " mainstream " trends and environments .
The mainstream is n't all from a privileged background and the values they bring to the table may look quite different than ours .
I suspect that , more often than not , what we 're dismissing are the values and cultures of people who are different .
I think that this is blatantly true when it fear becomes operationalized .
Fear of the " other " is core to white flight ; it is core to suburban attitudes about urban life .
But the same thing holds online .
Take for example the moral panics around MySpace and online sexual predators .
The data has consistently shown that MySpace is not a site of increased risk for youth and that risky behavior is more likely to occur in chatrooms than on MySpace .
Yet , if you 're a parent of a teen in this room , you 're probably scared shitless of MySpace .
Why ?
What are you scared of ?
Are you scared of the site or the possibility that your child might be exposed to values that are different than yours ?
Are you scared of the display of sexuality or just the display of working class sexuality ?
Needless to say , that 's a topic for a whole different conversation .
While teens are the starting point of this division , it has percolated through adult adoption as well .
And more explicitly so .
Unlike teens who are often straddling MySpace and Facebook , most adults are active on one or the other unless they have a specific professional or hobby - based reason to be on both .
Many of you know people who joined Facebook in the last year .
Well , numerous adults have also joined MySpace in the last year .
My guess is that no many of you know adults who have recently created accounts on MySpace .
Why ?
Because they probably are n't like you .
In many ways , adult worlds are even more divided than teen worlds .
Adults are less likely to know other adults who are n't like them than teens are .
There 's a concept in sociology called " homophily . "
It means birds of a feather stick together .
Whites know whites .
Democrats know Democrats .
Urbanites know urbanites .
Tech people know tech people .
Rich people know rich people .
And before you immediately start listing the people you know that are n't like you , realize that this is the auto - reaction to an uncomfortable reality ( more colloquially noticeable when people refer to " my black friend ... " ) .
Structurally , social networks are driven by homophily even when there are individual exceptions .
And sure enough , in the digital world , we see this manifested right before our eyes .
One thing to keep in mind about social media : the internet mirrors and magnifies pre-existing dynamics .
And it makes many different realities much more visible than ever before .
Racial divisions in American society should not shock anyone in this room , but the explicit - ness of them online can be quite startling .
For example , even schools that are " integrated " show racial rifts through Friending practices .
You can see homophily online and you can see the ways in which people who share physical space do not share emotional connections .
Implications
So why am I telling you that Facebook and MySpace are divided by race , class , education , and other factors ?
Because it matters .
And we need to talk about and address the implications of this divides .
First off , when people are structurally divided , they do not share space with one another and they do not communicate with one another .
This can and does breed intolerance .
Sociologists are obsessed with homophily because of the social and economic implications for such divisions .
If you do n't know people who are different than you , you do n't trust them .
Think about this in the context of the politics around gay rights .
The # 1 predictor for how someone will side in issues of gay rights is whether or not they know someone who is gay .
Social network sites complicate this even further .
Social network sites are not like email where it does n't matter if you 're on Hotmail or Yahoo .
When you choose MySpace or Facebook , you can't send messages to people on the other site .
You ca n't Friend people on the other site .
There 's a cultural wall between users .
And if there 's no way for people to communicate across the divide , you can never expect them to do so .
All this said , people are already divided and we accept that people from different backgrounds inhabit different environments .
We cannot expect technology to automatically integrate people and generate cultural harmony .
Although most of you call these sites " social networking sites , " there 's almost no networking going on .
People use these sites to connect to the people they know .
In other words , even if they could talk across the divide , they might not anyhow .
And even when people talk across differences , it does n't automatically solve underlying tensions .
Racial integration of schools was valuable for many reasons , but it did n't solve racism in this country .
But here 's the main issue with social divisions .
We can accept when people choose to connect to people who are like them and not friend different others .
But can we accept when institutions and services only support a portion of the network ?
When politicians only address half of their constituency ?
When educators and policy makers engage with people only through the tools of the privileged ?
When we start leveraging technology to meet specific goals , we may reinforce the divisions that we 're trying to address .
If you want people to connect around politics and democracy , information and ideas , you need to understand the divisions that exist .
Many of us in this room see social network sites as a modern day incarnation of the public sphere .
Politicians login to these sites to connect with constituents and hear their voices .
Campaign managers and activists try to rally people through these sites .
Market researchers try to get a sense of people 's opinions through these sites .
Educators try to connect with students and build knowledge sharing communities .
This is fantastic .
But there is n't one uniform public sphere .
There are numerous publics ( and counterpublics ) .
In many ways , the Internet is providing a next generation public sphere .
Unfortunately , it 's also bringing with it next generation divides .
The public sphere was never accessible to everyone .
There 's a reason than the scholar Habermas talked about it as the bourgeois public sphere .
The public sphere was historically the domain of educated , wealthy , white , straight men .
The digital public sphere may make certain aspects of public life more accessible to some , but this is not a given .
And if the ways in which we construct the digital public sphere reinforce the divisions that we 've been trying to break down , we 've got a problem .
Not everyone has the skills or understanding to engage with the public sphere in a meaningful manner .
If you think that civics education is in bad shape in this country , take a look at media literacy .
Digital publics combine the worst of both of these .
Most of you in this room learned to use Twitter and Facebook through your friends .
Collectively , you set the norms for what is appropriate among your network .
If you are n't part of these networks , these technologies may feel very foreign .
I recommend each and every one of you to login to MySpace and try to make sense of it today .
It will feel foreign to you because it's not your community , it 's not your friends .
Now imagine how people who are n't like you feel when they walk into Facebook or Twitter .
So as we think about creating public spaces , what 's the meeting point for our conversations ?
Is it MySpace or Facebook ?
Twitter or IRC ?
What you choose matters .
Where you and your colleagues hang out matters .
The " voices " of the Internet that you get are biased by the people who are in the places that you hang out .
But do you know this ?
Do you account for it ?
Are you working to represent all people or just the people that you can see and hear ?
When you 're trying to reach out to people , are you trying to reach out to all people or just the people in the environments that you understand ?
Are you embracing difference or are you only taking into account that with which you are comfortable ?
In the US , we can talk about MySpace and Facebook , but the politics are different in every country .
What divides people often differs as well , although " class " is still salient almost everywhere .
For example , if you look at Indian use of social media , you 'll see a divide between Orkut and Facebook that plays out along caste and professional lines .
Even if you 're not working in the States , you need to account for social divisions .
You just might have to look in different places .
Divides also play out inside sites .
Consider everyone 's beloved Twitter .
For starters , who uses the site represents a small minority of American ( let alone international ) online participants .
Teens , for example , are not using the site .
But even among those who are , they are n't part of one gigantic public space .
Consider the discussion of the Iranian election .
If you were in certain cohorts , you could n't miss the green - ification of people 's profiles , the discussions of #iranelection .
But , even though said conversations were massively prolific , only a small percentage of the user base was even aware of this beyond the trending topic .
Those who were following 50cent and Miley Cyrus were oblivious to these conversations .
And , in a matter of moments , this became visible when Michael Jackson died and captured the attention of a much broader swath of users , nearly taking Twitter down with it .
In your world , Iran probably matters more than Michael Jackson .
But do n't for a second think that this is universal .
MySpace vs. Facebook is not the only divide taking place online nor will it be the last .
These divides are going to keep on happening as social media becomes increasingly prevalent and as features of social media are baked into every site on the web .
Takeaways
Talking about inequality and social stratification is difficult and messy .
Even as I 'm diving into this data , I find myself struggling to get my words around these issues because it is patently clear that Americans - self included - do not have a language for talking about issues of race and class and stratification .
Academically , we primarily rely on British language but this does n't work so well in the States .
So , as you think about these issues , do n't feel badly if you find yourself stumbling over words or facing ideas that you can't articulate .
Goddess knows , I struggled in writing this talk .
And I 'm sure that I offended some , but my hope here is to get to the crux of the story , even if my language is imprecise .
Before I leave you , I want to more explicitly highlight the ideas I hope you can take away from this talk .
1 ) Social stratification is pervasive in American society ( and around the globe ) .
Social media does not magically eradicate inequality .
Rather , it mirrors what is happening in everyday life and makes social divisions visible .
What we see online is not the property of these specific sites , but the pattern of adoption and development that emerged as people embraced them .
People brought their biases with them to these sites and they got baked in .
2 ) There is no universal public online .
What we see as user " choice " in social media often has to do with structural forces like homophily in people 's social networks .
Social stratification in this country is not cleanly linked to race or education or socio- economic factors , although all are certainly present .
More than anything , social stratification is a social networks issue .
People connect to people who think like them and they think like the people with whom they are connected .
The digital publics that unfold highlight and reinforce structural divisions .
3 ) If you are trying to connect with the public , where you go online matters .
If you choose to make Facebook your platform for civic activity , you are implicitly suggesting that a specific class of people is more worth your time and attention than others .
Of course , splitting your attention can also be costly and does n't necessarily mean that you 'll be reaching everyone anyhow .
You 're damned if you do and damned if you do n't .
The key to developing a social media strategy is to understand who you 're reaching and who you 're not and make certain that your perspective is accounting for said choices .
Understand your biases and work to counter them .
4 ) The Internet has enabled many new voices to enter the political fray , but not everyone is sitting at the table .
There 's a terrible tendency in this country , and especially among politically minded folks , to interpret an advancement as a solution .
We have not eradicated racism .
We have not eradicated sexism .
We have not eradicated inequality .
While we 've made tremendous strides in certain battles , the war is not over .
The worst thing we can do is to walk away and congratulate ourselves for all of the good things that have happened .
Such attitudes create new breeding grounds for increased stratification .
The more that we rely on certain kinds of social media as the solution , the more we define a modern day " second class citizenship . "
We desperately need to address issues of access and media literacy to combat this , but we also need to re-engage around broader issues of inequality , intolerance , and social divisions .
Technology is n't the savior , but it sure can highlight the work we need to do .
We have some serious work to do , work that goes beyond technology .
We can use technology as a tool to connect with people , but we can't assume that it will eliminate all of the serious issues we have to face in this country .
My hope is that each and every one of you might begin looking at social media with a critical eye .
This is a tremendous time , filled with inspiring case studies .
But it 's also a harrowing time where pervasive social stratification is being reified in a new era .
If we do n't address this head on , inequality will develop deeper roots that will further cement divisions in our lives .
Please do n't look the other way .
Please use this as an opportunity to face our societal issues head - on .
Thank you !

Why Not Focus On Selling On Amazon ?
One of the most common questions I get asked is why bother starting your own online store when you can sell on Amazon ?
After all , Amazon commands a 50 % market share in the ecommerce space .
But even though Amazon owns 50 % , the remaining 50 % of customers find their products on Google , shop at big box and department stores , and support their local businesses .
In fact , the most important reason to sell on your own website is because you own your customer list which allows you to attract repeat business .
Have you ever heard the saying that getting a repeat customer is infinitely cheaper and easier than acquiring a brand new customer ?
This statement is 100 % true .
In fact , repeat business makes up over 36 % of our annual revenues for our ecommerce store .
Whenever I want to generate instant sales for my shop , I simply send out an email or an SMS message to my list .
When you sell on Amazon however , you have no such list because Amazon hides all of your customers from you .
Overall , Amazon ’s primary downsides are that you can not …
Establish your own brand – People who shop on Amazon have no idea that they are buying from a 3rd party .
– People who shop on Amazon have no idea that they are buying from a 3rd party .
Maintain business stability – Amazon can ban you at any time , raise prices or reduce the visibility of your products .

In contrast , with your own shop you can …

Even though Amazon has its disadvantages , it does n’t necessarily mean that you should n’t be selling there .
Amazon is actually a great way to validate your products before you launch but owning your own online shop is where you eventually want to end up .
Step # 1 : Choose the Right Ecommerce Business Model For You
Before you launch your online store , you first need to pick an ecommerce business model that works for you .
And this will largely depend on your budget , your tolerance for risk and how quickly you want to start making money .
A common misconception with starting an online store is that you have to carry inventory when you sell physical products online .
But did you know that you can run an ecommerce store without ever having to touch or ship a single product ?
Overall , there are 4 main ecommerce business models to choose that each have their own pros and cons .
As mentioned earlier , the right model for you depends primarily on the following factors .
How much you are willing to invest
you are willing to invest
Whether you want to deal with inventory

How quickly you want to make money
Ecommerce Business Model # 1 : Start An Affiliate Store
Affiliate marketing is when you partner with a retail store and act as a virtual salesperson for their products .
In other words , instead of listing your own products for purchase , you list your partner ’s products and then redirect customers to their website using affiliate links .
For every sale you refer , you get paid a commission .
For example , Amazon Associates is one of the largest affiliate networks out there and it gives you instant access to millions of physical and digital products .
For every product that a customer buys within 24 hours ( e.g. entire basket of their products ) , you take a cut of the profit .
Overall , the affiliate model is the easiest way to make money with the least amount of upfront cost .
But unfortunately , it also carries the lowest profit percentage .

Is An Affiliate Store Right For You ?
If you are on an extremely low budget , you should consider this business model .
It ’s a great way to get a feel for the market and instantly carry thousands of products in your online store .
A common path for affiliate store owners is to start out as an affiliate and then carry inventory for your bestselling products to make more money .
But overall , the affiliate store model carries the least amount of margin and the ramp up time can be long .
Ecommerce Business Model # 2 : Start A Dropshipping Store
Dropshipping is when you take orders on your website and your supplier fulfills and ships the product to the end customer on your behalf .
Depending on the dropship supplier , the packaging and shipping label can be marked with your logo and brand name making it appear as if the product came from your shop .
Dropshipping is one of the easiest ways to get started with an online store without having to worry about carrying inventory .
Once you make arrangements with a dropship distributor , you just need to set up your online store and start taking orders and the distributor will deliver the actual goods to the customer .
Overall , the profit you make is the difference between your selling price and the wholesale price you ’ve negotiated with your supplier .

Is Dropshipping Right For You ?
Dropshipping offers many of the same advantages as affiliate marketing .
You can get started with very little money and it ’s also a great way to instantly carry hundreds or thousands of products .
You can also start out dropshipping and then carry inventory for your bestselling products to boost your margins .
The biggest downside with this business model is that there ’s a much slower ramp up to significant profit .
In addition , price erosion can be a problem because there will be many other vendors selling the exact same products .
Managing customer support is also a huge challenge with dropshipping .
You must choose a reliable manufacturer to work with or else customer service will be a nightmare .
Overall , in order to run a successful dropshipping business , you must be mentally tough and have a solid content strategy in place .
Ecommerce Business Model # 3 : Selling Other People ’s Products With Inventory
Selling other people ’s products and carrying inventory as a retailer is the most common way to start on online store .
With this business model , you buy products at low prices from wholesale distributors and ship orders directly to the end customer .
Compared to dropshipping and affiliate marketing , the profit margins are significantly higher .
As a result , the traditional online store route is a much faster way to make money in a shorter amount of time .
Traditional Online Store Advantages :

Customers will comparison shop which will drive down prices .
Is Opening A Traditional Store Right For You ?
Starting a traditional online store requires an initial investment in inventory .
As a result , there ’s a greater up front cost with this business model .
But the good news is that most wholesalers have low minimum order requirements on the order of $ 100 - $ 200 .
Overall , the starting investment for a traditional ecommerce store can be less than $ 500 ( approximately $ 100 + initial inventory ) .
What ’s nice is that you can combine this strategy with dropshipping .
Use a dropship supplier to fill out your store and then carry inventory for your best sellers .
The higher margins will allow you to pay for traffic and ramp up sales much faster .
Ecommerce Business Model # 4 : Sell Your Own Private Label Products
Not everyone has the starting budget to sell their own branded goods , but those who do usually make the most profits of them all .
Selling your own private label products gives you complete control over every aspect of your business .
You can manufacture products to your own specifications and apply your unique brand label that no one else can copy .
When it comes to private label selling , there ’s a common misconception that you need to be a designer or an inventor to create a product from scratch .
But in reality , you do n’t need to be an artist or have any design skills whatsoever .
In fact , most private sellers rarely create anything from scratch .
By working with a factory , you can place your brand on an existing product ( called white labeling ) or make slight modifications to an existing product to make it your own .
For example , if you want to sell a handbag , you can easily work with a manufacturer to make small modifications like adding an additional pocket .
No design skills are required !
Private Label Advantages :

Is Selling Private Label Products Right For You ?
Selling your own private label products is the ecommerce business model that I recommend for long term success and the fastest ramp up to significant profit .
You are the boss of your own brand and no one else can price match you .
If you have the budget to invest in a private label product ( $ 1 - 2 K minimum ) , selling your own goods is always the way to go .
Private label selling offers the most flexibility and the highest profit margins .
Even though it costs more to get started , you can sell on Amazon and Ebay while simultaneously building your own branded shop and quickly recoup your costs .
Which Ecommerce Business Model Should You Go With ?
As with everything in life , there ’s a direct correlation between the effort that you put in and the amount of profit that you can make .
Greater risks always carry more rewards .
The cheapest way to get started in ecommerce is with an Amazon affiliate store but it will take a long time before you see a significant profit .
The good news is that all of these ecommerce business models are not mutually exclusive .
You can combine some or all of these models together instead of choosing just one .
For example , some of the students in my Create A Profitable Online Store course start out with dropshipping or domestic wholesale and then private label their best selling products .
To help you decide where to begin , I put together this handy table for your review .
Ultimately , your decision should always be based on your own unique situation and capabilities .

Step # 2 : Choose the Best Products to Sell Online
Once you ’ve selected your business model , it ’s time to brainstorm products to sell online .
In fact , more than half the battle of starting a successful online store is finding the right products to sell .
Overall , there are 3 types of products you can sell online and you need to think about what purpose your product serves .
Are You Selling Candy ?
A “ candy - like ” product is a product that does n’t solve an identified problem .
It ’s a nice - to - have .
People enjoy buying “ candy ” because candy brings immediate pleasure .
And selling candy can be super profitable if you catch the wave of a trend .
For example , fidget spinners were a popular “ candy ” and they sold millions of units worldwide in a short period of time before sales eventually plummeted .
The biggest disadvantage with “ candy ” products is that they can quickly go out of style .
You can ride the wave while it lasts but do n’t expect long - term gains with this type of product .
Are You Selling Vitamins ?
A “ vitamin ” is a product that solves an emotional need but the benefits are difficult to quantify .
For example , I take Airborne when I ’m sick , but I have no idea if it actually does anything .
All I know is that it makes me feel better .
As a result , I continue to buy this product .
A good “ vitamin like ” product fulfills a psychological need and generates recurring revenue .
Are You Selling Painkillers ?
Painkillers solve a problem and are the best types of products to sell online .
For example , Abby , a student in my Create A Profitable Online Store Course makes millions of dollars every year selling special insoles for women ’s high - heeled shoes .
Her insoles solves an immediate need for women everywhere who experience foot pain from wearing high - heeled shoes .
My friend Kevin sells a laser hair growth product for men and makes millions of dollars every year .
When you have a hair loss problem , you ’ll spend whatever it takes to get it back .
While painkillers are the best type of product to sell , it ’s perfectly fine to sell vitamins and candy as long as you have the proper expectations .
In the end , you can make money no matter what type of product you choose if you execute properly .
To help you brainstorm different products to sell , here are the tools and platforms I use to quickly find profitable products to sell .
Leverage Amazon Sales Data To Find A Good Product To Sell
With businesses across the country shut down because of the pandemic , Amazon has become the staple for online shopping .
More people than ever are turning to Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs quickly .
As mentioned earlier , Amazon holds the largest ecommerce market share of any single company .
For this reason , sales data derived from Amazon is a great representation of overall demand .
Now it ’s not obvious how you can derive actual sales numbers from Amazon but I ’ll show you how below .
Every item sold on Amazon is assigned a best seller rank ( BSR ) .
This number is used by Amazon to rank how well a product is selling compared to others within the same category .
Here ’s an example of a BSR rating for silicon baking mats on Amazon :
Based on this product ’s BSR , you can make an educated guess on how many units are sold per day .
The sales chart above was given to me by my friend Greg Mercer .
And based on a BSR of 7,228 , this silicone baking mat listing generates about 10 sales per day .
By paying attention to the BSR , you can analyze thousands of products and get an approximation of sales .
With persistence and hard work , eventually you ’ll land on a profitable niche to pursue .
Amazon Product Research Tool : Jungle Scout
While using the BSR method is great , it can be tedious and time - consuming .
This is why I prefer to use a tool called Jungle Scout to help me quickly gather Amazon product data .
Jungle Scout assembles all products on Amazon into a clean , digestible table .
It can also collate products on Amazon that match your specific criteria .
For example , I can have Jungle Scout pull all products under the Kitchen & Dining category that make at least $ 5,000 per month and have less than 100 reviews .
This is extremely powerful !
Here is a 5 - minute video demo on how I use Jungle Scout to do product research .

Amazon Keyword Research Tool : Viral Launch
I also use Viral Launch , an Amazon tool that helps me find profitable keywords that people are searching for on Amazon .
Every keyword is assigned a star rating ( 5 being the highest ) , which allows you to quickly determine what search terms have high demand and low competition .
Below is a 5 minute video demo on how I use Viral Launch to do product research .

General Guidelines For Finding A Product To Sell On Amazon
If you are looking for a product to sell for Amazon specifically , here ’s some criteria to pay attention to .
Without quoting what the president said , Mr. Caro said it was clear Mr. Obama understood that precedent .
“ Any president with a grasp of history  and it seems to me President Obama has a deep understanding of history  would have to be very aware of what happened in another war to derail a great domestic agenda , ” he said .
Afghanistan , of course , is not exactly Vietnam .
At its peak , the United States had about 500,000 troops in Vietnam , compared with about 68,000 now set for Afghanistan , and most of those fighting in the 1960s were draftees as opposed to volunteer soldiers .
Vietnam , therefore , reached deeper into American society , touching more homes and involving more unwilling participants .
But the politics of the two seem to evoke comparisons .
Just as Mr. Johnson believed he had no choice but to fight in Vietnam to contain communism , Mr. Obama last week portrayed Afghanistan as the bulwark against international terrorism .
“ This is not a war of choice , ” he told the Veterans of Foreign Wars at their convention in Phoenix .
“ This is a war of necessity .
Those who attacked America on 9/11 are plotting to do so again .
If left unchecked , the Taliban insurgency will mean an even larger safe haven from which Al Qaeda would plot to kill more Americans . ”
Image Helicopters in South Vietnam in 1971 .

But while many Americans once shared that view , polls suggest that conviction is fading nearly eight years into the war .
The share of Americans who said the war in Afghanistan was worth fighting slipped below 50 percent in a survey released last week by The Washington Post and ABC News .
A July poll by the New York Times and CBS News showed that 57 percent of Americans think things are going badly for the United States in Afghanistan , compared with 33 percent who think they are going well .
That growing disenchantment in the countryside is increasingly mirrored in Washington , where liberals in Congress are speaking out more vocally against the Afghan war and newspapers are filled with more columns questioning America ’s involvement .
The cover of the latest Economist is headlined “ Afghanistan : The Growing Threat of Failure . ”
Richard N. Haass , a former Bush administration official turned critic , wrote in The New York Times last week that what he once considered a war of necessity has become a war of choice .
While he still supports it , he argued that there are now alternatives to a large - scale troop presence , like drone attacks on suspected terrorists , more development aid and expanded training of Afghan police and soldiers .

Bill Clinton gestures during a speech .
Bill : ' New era of progressive politics '
PITTSBURGH - Former President Bill Clinton told an audience of liberal online activists Thursday evening that the nation has “ entered a new era of progressive politics ” that could last for decades if Democrats can pass ambitious measures such as health care reform and climate change .
In a nearly hour - long keynote address to the fourth annual Netroots Nation convention in Pittsburgh , a gathering of roughly 1,500 progressive bloggers and activists , Clinton said the nation — and public opinion — has dramatically changed in the 16 years since he took office .
But he noted that President Barack Obama and the Democratic - controlled Congress needed the support of the online community to achieve their agenda .

“ We have entered a new era of progressive politics which , if we do it right , can last 30 or 40 years , ” Clinton said .
“ America has rapidly moved to another place on a lot of these issues . ”
“ The president needs your help , ” he said , “ and the cause needs your help . ”
Clinton warned against the dangers of failing to compromise on some elements of health care reform , calling for agreement on a plan that includes a handful of elements that have widespread public support and perhaps conceding on those that have little support among voters .
“ I want us to be mindful we may need to take less than a full loaf , ” he said .
“ We ca n’t be in the peanut gallery .
We have to be actors .
We ca n’t ask the President to go it alone .
We ca n’t ask Congress to go it alone . "
Clinton had a similar message on climate change legislation .
“ The President stuck his neck out here and the Congress stuck its neck out , ” he said , “ but we have to have a bill . ”
Clinton , who has met several times over the past year with bloggers to discuss a range of topics , told the audience that he is an avid reader of blogs who supplements his research with material gleaned from them .
“ I read a lot of your blogs on health care , ” he said .
The speech , which was otherwise warmly received , was interrupted several times by shouts from the audience referring to his administration ’s sanctioning of the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy regarding gays in the military and the former president ’s signing of the “ Defense of Marriage Act . ”
Clinton responded with an impassioned defense of his actions and expressed regret .
“ Nobody regrets how this was implemented any more than I do , ” he said .
“ I hated what happened . ”
As someone who works with some blind clients , yes I have heard them called talking books .
Sounds like you have other problems if this alone was enough to contemplate divorce .
Ronald T. Takaki , a prolific and controversial scholar who helped pioneer the field of ethnic studies and wrote animated histories about blacks , Asians , Latinos and other marginalized Americans during four decades on the UC Berkeley faculty , has died .
He was 70 .
Takaki killed himself at his Berkeley home Tuesday , his son Troy said .
The scholar had struggled for nearly 20 years with multiple sclerosis , a potentially debilitating neurological disease for which there is no cure .
“ He could n’t deal with it anymore , ” Troy Takaki said Thursday .
FOR THE RECORD :
Takaki obituary :
The obituary of Ronald T. Takaki , professor emeritus of ethnic studies at UC Berkeley , in Friday ’s Section A said he was dismissed from UCLA in 1970 .
He left of his own accord after being denied early tenure . —
Takaki was the author and editor of more than 20 books , including “ Iron Cages : Race and Culture in 19th Century America ” ( 1979 ) , “ Strangers From a Different Shore : A History of Asian Americans ” ( 1989 ) , “ A Different Mirror : A History of Multicultural America ” ( 1993 ) and “ Double Victory : A Multicultural History of America in World War II ” ( 2000 ) .
He established UC Berkeley ’s PhD program in ethnic studies , the first of its kind in the nation , and gave prestige to the program by drawing top - notch scholars to teach in it .
“ Ron Takaki elevated and popularized the study of America ’s multiracial past and present like no other scholar , and in doing so had an indelible impact on a generation of students and researchers across the nation and world , ” Don T. Nakanishi , director of UCLA ’s Asian American Studies Center , said Thursday .
Takaki , the grandson of Japanese immigrants , was an activist as well as a scholar .
He was a vigorous proponent of multicultural education and a vocal opponent of Proposition 209 , the 1996 California ballot initiative that rolled back affirmative action policies in state - funded institutions .
His work often invited controversy .
He earned some of his most favorable reviews for “ Strangers From a Different Shore , ” which covers the long history of Asian immigrants ’ odysseys to America , starting with the Chinese who arrived in the 1850s and ending with the Hmong refugees from Southeast Asia of the 1980s .
“ A superb balancing act , ” Jon Foreman wrote in the New York Times ’ review .
But the book was roundly criticized by some Asian American studies scholars , who cited instances of alleged plagiarism and raised questions about his research methods and treatment of women .
Perhaps a measure of his influence , an entire issue of the scholarly journal Amerasia in 1990 was devoted to critiques of the work .
The charges of plagiarism were investigated by a UC Berkeley administrative officer , but Takaki was cleared .
His focus on the pluralism of America began in the ethnic stew of Hawaii , where he grew up .
Born in Honolulu on April 12 , 1939 , he was the grandson of a Japanese immigrant who went to Hawaii in 1886 to work in the sugar cane fields .
After his father died when Takaki was 7 , he was raised by his mother and Chinese stepfather , who ran a Chinese restaurant in Honolulu .
“ I grew up peeling shrimp , cutting onions and reading ‘ Moby Dick , ’ ” he told The Times in 1989 .
Nicknamed “ Ten - toes Takaki , ” he was a fearless surfer who was indifferent to school .
But in high school a Japanese American teacher urged him to try college and wrote him a recommendation to the College of Wooster in Ohio , which accepted him .
One of three children , he was the first in his family to attend college .
His years at Wooster , where he was one of two Asian Americans on campus , gave him a new awareness of himself as an ethnic American .
One of his professors “ asked me how long I ’d been in this country , where did I learn to speak English .
I told him I was from Hawaii and he says , ‘ But how long have you been in this country ? ’
I guess I did n’t look American , ” he recalled in an interview in the Lincoln Journal Star in 2000 .
He graduated from Wooster in 1961 with a bachelor ’s in history .
At UC Berkeley he received a master ’s in 1962 and a doctorate in 1967 with a dissertation on the history of American slavery .
His doctoral work caught the attention of UCLA .
Takaki was hired and in 1967 taught the university ’s first African American history class .
When the young Japanese American , sporting a crew cut , walked into the classroom for the first time , the students , some wearing Afros and dashikis , fell silent .
One student finally spoke up .
“ Well , Prof. Takaki , ” the student said in a challenging tone , “ what revolutionary tools are we going to learn in this course ? ”
Takaki replied : “ We ’re going to study the history of the U.S. as it relates to African Americans .
We ’re going to strengthen our critical - thinking skills and our writing skills .
These can be revolutionary tools if we make them so . ’ ”
The class and its unlikely professor became hugely popular .
“ He won the hearts of the students , the African American and the many white students who were interested in black history in those days , ” recalled UCLA history professor Gary Nash .
Members of the campus ’ Black Student Union , which asked Takaki to be its advisor , later joked that it was “ just like a white university to find a yellow man to teach black history , ” Nash said .
Teaching the class , which drew students of various ethnicities , led Takaki to begin to reformulate race as “ more than just a binary of black and white . ”
It inspired him to develop a course on the comparative history of racial inequality .
UCLA dismissed him in 1970 after he openly criticized the university ’s hiring policies .
He wound up at Berkeley in 1972 and taught the course there for 28 years , often turning students away for lack of seats .
“ If he wanted to , he could have had 1,000 students each term , ” said retired ethnic studies professor Roberto Haro , who had taught with Takaki at Berkeley .
Takaki ’s first books focused on black history , such as “ A Pro-Slavery Crusade : The Agitation to Reopen the African Slave Trade ” ( 1971 ) , which examined the effect of abolition on the South ’s economy .
In the 1980s he began to focus on Asian American history , such as in “ Pau Hana : Plantation Life and Labor in Hawaii ” ( 1983 ) .
That book was his first attempt at writing narrative history , emphasizing the voices of his often obscure or unknown subjects to give “ the eye - level view of working in the cane fields , feeling the heat , breathing the red dust . ”
He continued to refine that approach in later books , such as “ Double Victory : A Multicultural History of America in World War II , ” which draws from letters , songs , poetry and other sources , and “ A Different Mirror , ” which told stories about minorities ’ struggles , such as the Japanese and Mexican farmworkers in California who united under the same strike banner in the early 1900s .
Takaki is survived by his wife , Carol Rankin ; sons Troy of Venice and Todd of El Cerrito , daughter Dana of Chester , Conn . ; a brother , Michael Young , of Thousand Oaks ; a sister , Janet Wong , of Chatsworth ; and seven grandchildren .
A memorial service is planned at UC Berkeley at a later date .
The family requests that any memorial donations be sent to the Asian Law Caucus , 55 Columbus Ave. , San Francisco , CA 94111 .

Some speculation that solar cycle 25 has already begun :
http://xrt.cfa.harvard.edu/resources/pubs/savc0707.pdf
Graph source : NASA News
This would be stunning , because it suggests that the sun has skipped a solar cycle ( # 24 ) .
Researchers , three from the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the other from Marshall Space Flight Center - NASA , have published a paper that suggests this possibility .
Does a polar coronal hole ’s flux emergence follow a Hale - like law ?
A. Savcheva1 , J.W. Cirtain2 , E.E. DeLuca1 , L. Golub1
ABSTRACT
Recent increases in spatial and temporal resolution for solar telescopes sensitive to EUV and X - ray radiation have revealed the prevalence of transient jet events in polar coronal holes .
Using data collected by the X - Ray Telescope on Hinode , Savcheva et al. ( 2007 ) confirmed the observation , made first by the Soft X - ray Telescope on Yohkoh , that some jets exhibit a motion transverse to the jet outflow direction .
The velocity of this transverse motion is , on average , 20 kms −1 .
The direction of the transverse motion , in combination with the standard reconnection model for jet production ( e.g. Shibata et al. 1992 ) , reflects the magnetic polarity orientation of the ephemeral active region at the base of the jet .
From this signature , we find that during the present minimum phase of the solar cycle the jet - base ephemeral active regions in the polar coronal holes had a preferred east - west direction , and that this direction reversed during the cycle ’s progression through minimum .
In late 2006 and early 2007 , the preferred direction was that of the active regions of the coming sunspot cycle ( Cycle 24 ) , but in late 2008 and early 2009 the preferred direction has been that of the active regions of sunspot cycle 25 .
These findings are consistent with the results of Wilson et al. ( 1988 ) that there is a high latitude expansion of the solar activity
cycle .

President Barack Obama is trying to make positive changes in the United States , but is being fought at every turn by right - wingers who hate him because he is black , former Cuban leader Fidel Castro said on Tuesday .
In an unusually conciliatory column in the state - run media , Castro said Obama had inherited many problems from his predecessor , George W. Bush , and was trying to resolve them .
But the “ powerful extreme right wo n’t be happy with anything that diminishes their prerogatives in the slightest way . ”
Obama does not want to change the U.S. political and economic system , but “ in spite of that , the extreme right hates him for being African - American and fights what the president does to improve the deteriorated image of that country , ” Castro wrote .
“ I do n’t have the slightest doubt that the racist right will do everything possible to wear him down , blocking his program to get him out of the game one way or another , at the least political cost , ” he said .

When I wrote earlier today that people should as a general matter avoid Nazi and Hitler comparisons , I did n't realize that today Rush Limbaugh would be comparing the Democrats to ... the Nazis and Hitler .
Media Matter has the video .
Watch it and chuckle or cry or whatever .
It 's mind - numbingly nonsensical ( and got a pretty good going - over on Hardball tonight ) .
People should start asking GOP office - holders if Democrat / Nazi comparisons are justifiable .
Let 's see if any defy El Rushbo on this one .
But then think about the assertion .
Or the idea that the White House is compiling some sort of enemies list from forwarded emails .
Or the fantastical notion that the healthcare reform bill is going to empower the government to murder old people .
Political rhetoric is building to a hysterical , nigh - apocalyptic pitch that 's scary .
( Tim Mak of NewMajority has an interesting take on why conservative talk radio is angrier and more extreme than it has ever been : Revenues have declined 30 - 40 percent over the last two years .
They need to get crazier just to keep raking in bucks . )
Mob rule triumphing over civil discourse is not a good thing .
And neither is the festering , smoldering anger fueling the town hall demonstrations .
" Would n’t Republicans and conservatives do better to criticize Democrats for what they actually are and actually do — rather than indulge in paranoid fantasies that are too laughable to frighten ? "
David Frum blogged this morning .
But what happens when we reach a point where people are whipped up enough that they actually start believing this stuff ?
Wingnut demagogues can denounce violence ( as being tactically inefficient , anyway ) , but that 's a hollow message if they spend the rest of their time suggesting that Nazis have seized power .
Creating Executable Jars For Your Clojure Application
It is possible to create stand alone executable Jar files for your Clojure programs .
In this post I walk you through the issues you need to keep in mind and the steps you need to take to create the jar .
You can download the example code this post walks through in its entirety from my GitHub account ( under examples / exec - jar ) .
I used ant to build the jar , other Java development tools can also do the task .
Jar Files
Jar files are Zip files with a few conventions for what goes where and of their contents .
Jar files support a Manifest File file which tells Java what the archive contains .
The manifest file has a simple format of key / value pairs , very similar to an HTTP header .
This is manifest for the Clojure Jar :
Manifest - Version : 1.0 Ant - Version : Apache Ant 1.7.1 Created - By : 11.2-b01 ( Sun Microsystems Inc. ) Main - Class : clojure .main Class - Path : .
The important bit there is ‘ Main - Class ’ .
The Main - Class specifies the Java class that will be executed by default when run as java - jar clojure .
jar .
In clojure . jar the main class is clojure .
main .
Clojure Application
The example application performs a Google search , printing each link and its text :
( ns com.github.kyleburton.app ( : gen-class ) ( :use [ com.github.kyleburton.sandbox.web : as kweb ] [ com.github.kyleburton.sandbox.landmark - parser : as lp ] [ clojure.contrib.str-utils : as str-utils ] ) ) ( defn fetch - page [ terms ] ( let [ page ( kweb / get -> string ( format " http://www.google.com/search?q=%s " ( str-utils / str-join " + " terms ) ) ) ] ( doseq [ link ( filter #( .contains % " class=l " ) ( lp/html -> anchors page ) ) ] ( let [ href ( lp / anchor - > href link ) text ( kweb / strip - html ( lp/ anchor - > body link ) ) ] ( println text ) ( println href ) ( println "
" ) ) ) ) ) ( defn show - help [ ] ( pritnln " app term [ term2 [ term3 ... ] ]
Performs a Google Search for the given terms " ) ) ( defn - main [ & terms ] ( cond ( empty ? terms ) ( show - help ) true ( fetch - page terms ) ) )
Compilation
Java will only run Java byte code so we need to compile the application .
I ’ve set up the build.xml to do so :
< target name= " compile " description = " Run the Clojure Compiler " > < property name = " cpath " refid=" classpath " /> < echo message= " cpath=${cpath} " /> < mkdir dir= " ${classes.dir} " /> < java classname=" clojure.lang.Compile " fork = " true " > < sysproperty key =" clojure.compile.path " value= " ${classes.dir} " /> < classpath refid=" classpath " /> < arg value= " com.github.kyleburton.app " /> </ java > </ target >
The jar - with - manifest then uses the compiled classes , generates a manifest file and uses
Ant ’s jar task with a series of zipfileset s to combine the clojure , clojure - contrib and other dependency ’s jars into a single , executable , jar :
< target name= " jar - with - manifest " depends =" compile " description = " Build the JAR " > < manifest file = " ${target.dir}/MANIFEST.MF " > < attribute name = " Built - By " value= " ${user.name} " /> < attribute name= " Main - Class " value= " com.github.kyleburton.app " /> </ manifest > < jar jarfile= " ${target.dir}/${jar.file.name} " manifest= " ${target.dir}/MANIFEST.MF " > < fileset dir= " ${classes.dir} " includes= "**/*.class " /> < zipfileset src= " ${clojure.jar} " /> < zipfileset src= " ${clojure-contrib.jar} " /> < zipfileset src=" ${krb-utils.jar.repo}/commons-httpclient-3.1.jar " /> < zipfileset src=" ${krb-utils.jar.repo}/commons-codec-1.3.jar " /> < zipfileset src=" ${krb-utils.jar.repo}//commons-logging-1.1.1.jar " /> < zipfileset src=" ${krb-utils.jar.repo}//commons-logging-1.1.1-sources.jar " /> < zipfileset src=" ${krb-utils.jar.repo}//commons-logging-adapters-1.1.1.jar " /> < zipfileset src=" ${krb-utils.jar.repo}//commons-logging-api-1.1.1.jar " /> </ jar > </ target >
Running The Application
Our application can now be run all by itself with java - jar ... :
kyleburton@indigo64 exec- jar[ master * ] $ java - jar target / exec - jar - 0.1.jar ant zipfileset ZipFileSet Type http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTypes/zipfileset.html

Conclusion
Bundling your application into a single Jar can simplify the deployment , and distribution of your application .
What tends to be less desirable about this technique though is that you have to track your dependencies carefully ( you risk ClassNotFoundException s ) and the jars you create are often quite large .
You can not add additional jars or paths to the classpath when running java - jar , which means that you wo n’t be able to re-use the libraries across other applications .
This technique allows you to create a single file that your users can download to run your clojure based applications .

While the rest of California struggles with joblessness and budget woes , this high desert city is proof of the power of government spending .
Uncle Sam has helped turn it into a modern - day boomtown .
A hospital , three hotels and a pizza restaurant are under construction on the main drag , where heavy equipment clears land once covered by sage and creosote bushes .
Crooked “ No Vacancy ” signs are a familiar sight at local motels , whose parking lots are jammed most weeknights with contractors ’ oversized pickup trucks .
Job recruitment billboards greet drivers heading toward Ridgecrest on California 14 .
Once known as Crumville , this parched community of 28,000 about 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles has become the land of opportunity .
At least for those who do n’t mind isolation , searing heat and little entertainment beyond Wednesday night karaoke at the local bar .
“ We do n’t have Disneyland , we do n’t have an opera house , ” Mayor Steven Morgan said .
“ But California is having economic troubles , and we have jobs . ”
Advertisement
The source of those help - wanted billboards -- and the engine of Ridgecrest ’s economy -- is the U.S. Department of Defense .
The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division , situated on the 1.1 - million - acre testing range known to many here simply as China Lake , expects to add 1,000 civilian jobs by 2011 , many of them good - paying engineering and computer science posts .
About 4,300 civilians are currently employed on the base .
The weapons division is also spending $ 200 million on research centers , labs and other buildings where it will continue to develop armaments for the Navy and Marines .
In response , the local hospital and school district are pouring millions into renovations to prepare for growth .
And developers are building houses and hotels to accommodate base visitors , hiring contractors from across the West .
The result is that Ridgecrest has been largely insulated from the state ’s downward economic spiral .

The city ’s unemployment rate of 8.4 % in June was well below the state ’s 11.6 % average and is much lower than the 14.7 % rate in surrounding Kern County .
Home values are also holding up better than in many other areas .
The median in Ridgecrest in May was $ 165,000 , down 8.3 % from May 2008 .
That compares with a 42 % plunge in Kern County over the same period .
There ’s no question that Ridgecrest has felt some fallout from the larger economic downturn .
A Mervyn ’s closed when the department store chain went out of business , and a car dealership was lost when its owner moved it to Los Angeles .
But despite a $ 250,000 decline in sales tax revenue , Ridgecrest will still end the fiscal year with a $ 1 - million cushion .
That relative security has made Ridgecrest an oasis of jobs -- although not everybody ’s happy about it .

When a government commission recommended in 2005 that naval defense research be consolidated at China Lake , employees at the Navy weapons station in balmy , seaside Point Mugu in Ventura County were aghast .
A poll of workers there showed that about 80 % of those slated for transfer said they ’d rather quit than move to the desert .
Finding enough skilled people “ is a challenge , ” said Doris Lance , a spokeswoman for the China Lake facility .
She recently left the base to work in Arizona .
Last month , the weapons division added two additional recruiting billboards on the 101 Freeway in Ventura County in addition to its giant “ Now Hiring ” signs on California 14 .
Building contractors , too , have long had a tough time coaxing laborers to commute to the desert for work , said Mark Crisci , executive vice president of K Partners Hospitality Group , which completed a 93 - room SpringHill Suites in Ridgecrest last year and is currently building a Hampton Inn across the street .
Not anymore .
With the construction industry hammered by the housing bust , hard hats are now grudgingly making the drive .

Jim Buford , a pipe - fitter from Buena Park who is working on the new hospital , said that a couple of years ago he could ignore requests to work out of town .
But threatening to quit wo n’t gain him much leverage with his employer now , not when Ridgecrest is one of the only places to find work .
Laborers fill the town ’s motels during the week .
The Motel 6 is nicknamed the construction frat house because the men stand outside their teal green doors at night drinking beer .
Stephen Edstrom , a road grading superintendent , flies every week from his home near Ogden , Utah , to Las Vegas , then drives about 240 miles to Ridgecrest .
He misses his family , he said .
But he needs the paycheck .
“ You ’ve got to do what you ’ve got to do , ” he said , dipping his feet in the pool at the town ’s Econo Lodge .
“ This is the only job I could find . ”

Several big projects are underway .
The Sierra Sands Unified School District is investing $ 25 million to modernize its schools .
Ridgecrest Regional Hospital is spending $ 70 million to add units to its 80 - bed facility by 2010 .
Others are in the pipeline .
The planning commission recently approved a 223 - lot housing development .
And the city is negotiating to bring in a Wal - Mart Supercenter .
In May , 109 homes were sold in Ridgecrest , more than triple the number sold in May 2008 , according to Zillow.com .
“ It ’s a good economy here in Ridgecrest , ” said Stan Dye , an entrepreneur who is building a pizza parlor on the town ’s main thoroughfare , China Lake Boulevard .

Twentysomethings who would n’t have given Ridgecrest a second glance in better times are finding it preferable to the unemployment line .
Currently , about 75 % of the young professionals offered jobs at China Lake accept them , said Betty Miller , head of the professional recruitment office at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division .
That ’s higher than in previous years .
Andrew Gray , a 28 - year - old UC San Diego graduate , was n’t impressed by Ridgecrest when he first visited the base to interview for a job as a test manager .
“ The job looked cool , but the town did n’t , ” he said .
He accepted the position and has adapted fairly well , though he visits L.A. every other weekend to attend business school part time .
Because of the base ’s research center , his boss likes to say that you ca n’t swing a dead cat in Ridgecrest without hitting a Ph.D .
Settling in Ridgecrest is a matter of perspective , said Billy D. Williams , a 30 - year - old computer scientist who moved from Lompoc , Calif . , last year .

He can walk into the local sports bar , Tommy T’s , and know everybody , he said .
He ’s gotten involved in a pool league in town , and he officiates at town baseball and football games .
It ’s a far cry from New York , where he lived for years , he said , but he ’s willing to make sacrifices to work to support the military mission .
“ You have to take this place for what it ’s worth , ” he said .
“ If you compare the rest of the world to New York , you ’ll be disappointed . ”

“ I ca n’t wait to eat .
I ’m starving ! ”
No kidding , Zooey .
If I objected to meat and dairy of any kind and was allergic to most pastas and bread , perhaps I too could be a doe - eyed indie - flick object of desire .
But more on that in a bit .

In light of what was to come , it was an excellent idea for Top Chef Masters to kick off tonight ’s hour with a burger challenge , because God knows what Zooey Deschanel would have done if confronted with the two - and - a - half pound beef monstrosity Michael put together for the Quickfire .
If the Elimination Challenge was all about working within rigid dietary boundaries , the burger challenge was more about expanding one ’s definition of what a burger could be , not contracting into something narrow and joyless .
Poor Anita , who was so dominant last week and in the opening round , was guilty this time of expanding the definition too much , which is the sad consequence of her creative impulse .
To me , the very idea of burger bits floating around in a cheddar soup sounded pretty repulsive , but it was a shame that Anita could n’t make it a revelation against all expectations .
Perhaps there are limits to what a burger can be , after all .
As for the others , Hubert was a victim of runaway hubris :
After boasting about the 1000 burgers / day at his restaurant — one of which will set you back $ 5,000 ( if there ’s not a $ 4990 bill stuffed inside , I ’m not eating it ) — he topped his beef patty with a Roquefort cheese that the guest judges found bold but overpowering .
( And for once , it was a pretty acceptable group of judges , with two burger “ experts ” — including Spike , who was never brilliant on Top Chef , but appears to have found success — and Super Size Me gimmick - meister Morgan Spurlock . )
Art acquitted himself with a cornmeal hoecake burger ( nearly Zooey - friendly , that one ) and Rick retreated to his Mexican wheelhouse with a “ queso fundido ” burger with three types of guacamole on the side .
( His reaction to the judges ’ “ Why do I need all this guacamole ? ” response speaks to a fussiness that makes him a meticulous chef and probably a pain in the neck to his kitchenmates .
Michael triumphed by sticking to the basics : A big-ass burger with truffles that was cooked perfectly and tasted like a good steak .
Ca n’t go wrong with that .

The Elimination Challenge made for tremendously entertaining television , because watching great chefs squirm their way through a vegan menu is like subjecting a movie critic to a Pauly Shore marathon .
( Line of the night , from Gael Greene after the dinner party : “ The vegans seemed so surprised .
God knows what they get to eat . ” )
Add to it the fact that the meal had to be gluten and soy - free , and I honestly was wracking my brain trying to figure out what , besides a fruit - and - vegetable platter , Ms. Deschanel and company could safely consume .
Credit the five remaining chefs for doing their best under the circumstances , though Rick had a massive advantage in both the plethora of vegan - friendly staples in Mexican cuisine and in the fact that his daughter once had gluten allergies .
The others made do with what they had , and a couple had some pesky ingredients , including Michael , who had a hand - separate his quinoa pasta and the overmatched Art , who took dessert ( always a mistake ) and made store - bought rice ice cream a central component of his dish ( an even bigger mistake ) .
Hubert coasted on his appetizer plate , which could comfortably incorporate a beet salad and avocado along with a soup , and Anita , who was off her game all day , struggled with an Indian - flavored eggplant that everyone thought was too oily and overseasoned .
After Anita whiffed both the Quickfire and Elimination challenges , it seemed certain that she was out the door , but I was happy to see her get another chance to redeem herself .
Anita ’s failures tend to be failures of ambition , which to me are more respectable than failures of imagination or craft .
Art has never really seemed on the same level as the other chefs , and his quick embrace of the dessert course came with an admission that he simply did n’t know what else to do .
Does n’t matter how fresh those strawberries were : Nothing could redeem that vile scoop of ricecream .

Stray observations :
• Over on the Twitter , Movieline ( and erstwhile Defamer ) writer Mark Lisanti and I have been exchanging alternative vegan titles for Zooey Deschanel movies .
A few of my suggestions : ( 500 ) Days Of Sunchokes , Failure To Lunch , The Non-Food - Related Happening , Bridge To Arugula .
A few of his : The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Carnivore Robert Ford , Vegan Elf , and ( my personal favorite ) Almost Flavorless .

The split within the clergy appears to be widening A group of clerics in Iran has called Iran 's presidential vote invalid , contradicting official results .
The pro-reform group 's statement pits it against the top legislative body , which last week formally endorsed the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
On Saturday , former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said that post-election events had caused bitterness .
Britain said one of two UK embassy employees detained for " inciting protests " would be released .
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in the aftermath of the poll to protest at what they alleged was a fraudulent election .
The protests died down after the authorities deployed lethal force , killing at least 20 demonstrators .
More than 1,000 were arrested .
On Sunday , state news agency Irna quoted Iran 's police chief as saying about two - thirds of those arrested had been released .
The authorities have blamed the West , in particular the UK , for fomenting the unrest through the use of the media , including BBC Persian television which broadcasts to the country via satellite .
The head of Iran 's judiciary , Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi -Shahroudi , has said " those who co-operate with such websites and television channels will face prosecution " .
On Sunday , Iran 's foreign ministry said a British - Greek journalist working for The Washington Times - who had been arrested in connection with " recent street riots " - had been released .
' No authority '
The pro-reform clerics group said in a statement that the top legislative body , the Guardian Council , no longer had the right " to judge in this case . "
In a statement to the press , the Assembly of Qom Seminary Scholars and Researchers said some members of the Guardian Council had " lost their impartial image in the eyes of the public . "
Mr Rafsanjani is a possible mediator in the election dispute " How can one accept the legitimacy of the election just because the Guardian Council says so ?
Can one say that the government born out of the infringements is a legitimate one , " it said .
The Guardian Council is an unelected 12 - member council made up of six religious leaders , appointed by the supreme leader , and six jurists .
The statement is further proof of a split at the top of Iran 's establishment , correspondents say .
They say that in particular , it was an act of defiance against the country 's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
The group said the Guardian Council had not paid " attention " to the complaints lodged by the defeated candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , and urged other clerics to back them in calling the election and the new government illegitimate .
On Saturday , Mr Rafsanjani - an influential figure in Iranian politics and a prominent backer of Mr Mousavi during the election - met with the families of some of those who have been detained .
It was the first time he had spoken publicly since the election .
He told the families that nobody with a " vigilant conscience " could be satisfied with the current situation .
IRAN UNREST 12 June Presidential election saw incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 63 % of vote Main challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi called for result to be annulled on grounds of electoral fraud Street protests saw at least 17 people killed and foreign media restricted
Q&A : Election aftermath Analysis : Crisis set to rage on How Iran is ruled Who 's who in Iran Iran : Send your questions " I hope with good management and wisdom the issues would be settled in the next days and the situation could improve ...
We should think about protecting the system 's long - term interests , " Mr Rafsanjani said .
A BBC correspondent said that Mr Rafsanjani appeared to be hinting that a process was going on behind the scenes , which might resolve the current crisis .
Separately , one of the two British embassy staff still in custody in Iran was expected to be released on Sunday , according to the Foreign Secretary David Miliband .
Nine Iranians employed by the ambassador in Tehran were arrested and accused of stirring up unrest after the disputed presidential election .
There was concern on Friday when a senior Iranian cleric said some of them would be put on trial .
Mr Miliband told the BBC that efforts were now focused on securing the release of the last employee being held .
Tehran has repeatedly accused foreign powers - especially Britain and the US - of stoking unrest after the election .

From this and the other temples and monasteries around Kandy radiates the overwhelming and studied richness of the two chief colors of Buddhism : a rich , maroon - like red and a dazzling gold , painted on stone statues and sumptuously draping the giant sitting Buddha in each temple .
The murals in these temples are faded and blackened with age .
Only in the Eastern Orthodox churches in the Balkans have I come across a clutter of magnificence to match what I have seen in the Buddhist sanctuaries of Sri Lanka .
Even as you experience this whole sensual feast , your bare feet press against cold and wet stone , since the rains are constant during the southwest monsoon .
Here , you are alone with your thoughts .
Sri Lanka is in general a less panicky , less frantic , less intrusive version of India .
Only rarely are you hassled .
And Kandy , up in the hills , away from the crowded coastal highway , is a concentrated version of the country ’s charms .
Alas , when you fall in love with a place , you encounter its history , which is often tragic .
In fact , Kandy has remained seedily quaint , its monuments and ambience unravaged by mass tourism , only because Sri Lanka has experienced more than a quarter century of civil war between ethnic Sinhalese Buddhists and Hindu Tamils .
And the origins and conduct of that savage conflict have drawn , in many ways , from the same emotional wellsprings as the tradition of worship at Kandy ’s tranquil Buddhist shrines .
Buddhism holds an exalted place in the half - informed Western mind .
Whereas Christianity , Islam , Judaism , and Hinduism are each associated , in addition to their thought , with a rich material culture and a defended territory , Buddhism , despite its great monuments and architectural tradition throughout the Far East , is somehow considered purer , more abstract , and almost dematerialized : the most peaceful , austere , and uncorrupted of faiths , even as it appeals to the deeply aesthetic among us .
Hollywood stars seeking to find themselves — famously Richard Gere — become Buddhists , not , say , orthodox Jews .
Yet Buddhism , as Kandy demonstrates , is deeply materialistic and demands worship of solid objects , in a secure and sacred landscape that has required the protection of a military .
There have been Buddhist military kingdoms — notably Kandy ’s — just as there have been Christian and Islamic kingdoms of the sword .
Buddhism can be , under the right circumstances , a blood - and - soil faith .
Kandy may be the Buddhist world ’s best example of this .
From the late 16th to the early 19th centuries , the kingdom of Kandy sturdily held out against European invaders : the Portuguese , the Dutch , and the British in their turn .
“ Like many other armies in peasant and tribal societies , ” writes Channa Wickremesekera in Kandy at War : Indigenous Military Resistance to European Expansion in Sri Lanka 1594 to 1818 ( 2004 ) , “ the Kandyan army fought in loosely organized and highly mobile units depending on a flimsy logistical base , ” making optimum use of its rugged , jungly terrain .
It was very much like a 21st - century guerrilla insurgency , in other words — inspired , in this case , by the need to defend faith and homeland against heathen Europeans .
The dense forest through which I had passed on my train ride constituted the graveyard of European attempts to reach Kandy , with many a Portuguese , Hollander , and Briton dying or giving up , exhausted and demoralized , afflicted by disease amid the cruel jungle so well described by Leonard Woolf in his 1913 novel , The Village in the Jungle :
For the rule of the jungle is first fear , and then hunger and thirst .
There is fear everywhere : in the silence and in the shrill calls and the wild cries , in the stir of the leaves and the grating of branches , in the gloom , in the startled , slinking , peering beasts .
Eventually , the improved muskets and light artillery developed in Europe proved too much for the Kandyans .
The British , explains Wickremesekera , unlike the Portuguese and Dutch , had the added advantages of “ mastery over the neighboring Indian subcontinent and an army of over 100,000 soldiers when they clashed with Kandy . ”
They toppled King Wickrama of Kandy in 1815 .
He may have dug the lake , but he had been a tyrant and torturer .
At least that was how the British rationalized their actions .
Tonight at 9 p.m. EST on HDNet will be the show the always appears on the network at that time , namely , Inside MMA .
The difference this time will be that tonight 's episode is the 100th installment of the show .
On the eve of this centennial milestone , we spoke with HDNet Fights CEO Andrew Simon about the challenges the show and network have faced in developing the program over the past two years , what 's ahead for everyone involved and why the show still matters in an age where information and analysis are available in huge volumes in other mediums .
Luke Thomas :
What was and now is the goal of Inside MMA ?
Andrew Simon :
To be the best MMA news program on television and showcase fighters from around the world .
Luke Thomas :
What has been the hardest lesson to learn after 100 episodes ?
Andrew Simon :
We used to tape Kruck 's Korner before the show so guests could comment on it while in studio , but we would miss out on late breaking stories .
Inside MMA now has a second segment to make sure the show and our viewers do n't miss out on anything .
Luke Thomas :
Who has consistently been the best guest ?
Andrew Simon : I think great guests come from great hosts , so I would rather show respect to Bas , Kenny and Ron .
Because of them , we get the best guests in the MMA and entertainment world from Randy Couture , Chuck Liddell , Tito Ortiz , Royce Gracie , Fedor , GSP , Gina Carano , Rob Schneider , Mickey Rourke , Anderson Silva , etc .... we aim to be a show that top stars and up and comers want to come on .
Luke Thomas :
Do you consider ESPN's " MMA Live " to be your top competition ?
If not , then who ?
Andrew Simon : I think we are our toughest critic and competition .
I just got off a call with our executive producers and a separate call with Kenny Rice on how we can even make the show better .
Luke Thomas :
For viewers who may be unaware , how was Inside MMA changed since its inception ?
Andrew Simon :
We used to aim for a Hollywood guest on the panel each week - we learned that the " movie star " guest REALLY had to know MMA to not hurt their reputation among the MMA community .
Andrew Simon : I think it rarely happens ..... but I do n't see them changing the Tonight Show for one or two off nights : )
Luke Thomas :
Why has n't anyone from Bloody Elbow ever been a guest ?
It 's hard to argue we have n't impacted the digital media universe in MMA , yet we 've never received an invite .
Why ?
Andrew Simon :
Why was n't I asked questions from Bloody Elbow till today ; )
Luke Thomas : How committed to Inside MMA is HDNet ?
Andrew Simon :
It is a major property for HDNet and you can expect emails from me when we get to our 200th episode !
We are committed to this show and this sport .
Luke Thomas :
Where do you see Inside MMA headed in the next year or two ?
Andrew Simon : More LIVE
Inside MMA from events from around the globe .
This past weekend at the Strikeforce weigh - ins was a good example .
Luke Thomas :
Are you worried with MMA 's growth that other networks will try to create shows similar to Inside MMA ?
Andrew Simon :
It 's up to us to make people want to watch Inside MMA .
I never worry about what other 's are doing - we have to make sure we are putting the best show on regardless .
The growth of MMA will only help us .
Luke Thomas :
Is there any hope of getting the UFC to soften it 's position on not letting Inside MMA use multimedia , gain access to shows ?
Andrew Simon : Ask them .
I like to believe we have a good relationship with UFC .
Luke Thomas :
What is the value add of Inside MMA given the volume of analysis and information available on other shows or in other mediums ?
Andrew Simon : Inside MMA is the only show of its kind about MMA on television - true journalism that is unbiased and uncensored .
I read tons of Internet sites , including yours , daily .
No doubt about it that the Internet is a great source of info in the MMA world .
I do think Inside MMA / HDNet offer value - add in that we have featured 135 different fight promotions in 39 states and 12 different countries in the first 100 episodes .
When we say we will cover an event , smaller promotions may be able to get better fighters and bigger sponsors because they will be on Inside MMA on HDNet .
That is value add for everyone !
MORE changes were made yesterday over at Tom Estes ’ hysterical Christian blog , Hardtruths .
In addition to declaring it an “ almost atheist - free zone ” , the potty pastor has changed its description from “ Renaissance of Rational Thinking ” , to “ Exposing the Adverse Affects of Atheism on Our World ” .
He explains the changes thus :
When I started this blog , I wanted to show non-Christians that truly rational thought is one that understands that we have an all - powerful , loving God who created us in His image , and sustains the world we live in .
And while this obviously is the truth , a large segment of atheists that spend time on line are either unwilling or unable to see the rationale and logic behind such thinking .
The more I worked on this blog , the more I learned about logic .
Logic can be used as a tool if you ’re dealing with people who think the same as you , or share your world view , but it ’s completely useless with those who do n’t .
There have been many times when I felt that I was able to construct a concrete logical argument that could n’t be argued , only to have the very first atheist commenter attempt to rip it to shreds â€ ¦
There follows large swathes of twisted logic and mindless banality which I shall spare Estes the embarrassment of reproducing , but , if you have a high pain threshhold , you can read it all here .
It will come as no surprise that the first person to respond positively to the changes on Estes ’ blog was our very own imbecile of a troll , the evangelist Bob Hutton from Broadstairs in Kent , who had this to say :
I know exactly what you mean by the abuse of militant atheists ( sic ) .
I have tried to reason with these people on the Freethinker web site but all I received was vitriolic abuse .
Then they barred me from entering comments while they were going on about free speech .
Even now are they entering up disdainful comments about you on that blog .
However , this is part of the afflictions of the Gospel ( sic ) ; enemies of the Gospel will lie and be abusive in order to try and de-stabilise us , but it wo n’t work because Jesus already has the victory !
To which Estes replied : “ Amen Bob ! ”
Normally , a warm , fuzzy feeling overcomesÂ me when I successfully facilitate meetings of intelligent , like - minded people , but in this case my immediate reaction was :
Straitjackets for two , please garÃ§on !
Update :
If you really want a giggle , read P Z Myers ’ take on Estes ’ latest change .
Owners of Apple 's new iPhone 3GS love the device , but more than half of them hate AT&T , the smartphone 's exclusive mobile carrier in the U.S. , according to a just - released survey .
" There 's no indication that Apple 's AT&T problem is going away , " said Paul Carton , research director at ChangeWave Research .
" The better consumers feel about their iPhones , the worse they feel about AT&T . "
Carton said that the latest ChangeWave survey , which polled nearly 200 owners of Apple 's newest iPhone model , the 3GS , showed a " near - perfect satisfaction rating " for the product .
More than eight of every ten iPhone 3GS owners said they were " very satisfied " with the smartphone , while another 17 % said they were " somewhat satisfied . "
" Extraordinary , " is how Carton interpreted the 97 % total .
" That 's the highest ratings we have ever had for any smartphone , including previous iPhones , " he said .
But the poll also revealed major dissatisfaction with AT&T , the lone mobile service provider allowed to sell calling plans for the iPhone in the U.S .
When asked to name their top dislikes about the iPhone , 32 % named iPhone lock - in with AT&T , while 23 % pegged AT&T 's calling and data coverage , service quality and service speed .
Both responses , however , came in behind iPhone battery issues , which was the No. 1 dislike .
" One in two said AT&T was a top dislike , " said Carton .
" That speaks for itself .
The AT&T problem is by far the most significant pitfall of the iPhone . "
According to one consumer who participated in the survey , AT&T 's network coverage and speed is " nothing to write home about , " and " still drops a lot of calls . "
i Phone owners started complaining about AT&T within weeks of the smartphone 's launch two years ago , but the griping reached even higher levels last fall , when several users filed lawsuits that claimed Apple and AT&T were responsible for constantly - dropped calls , poor connections and slower - than - advertised data speeds .
A dozen of those lawsuits , all which sought class - action status , were consolidated into one action last month by a panel of federal judges .
Meanwhile , AT&T has reportedly been pushing Apple for an extension to the exclusive deal , hoping to lock in the California computer and consumer electronics maker until at least 2011 .
Analysts have said it would n't be in Apple 's interest to agree , and have speculated that the company will , in fact , open the iPhone to other carriers next year .
Verizon is typically the provider at the top of their list , as well as consumers ' lists .
" Our survey results suggest that Apple will be forced to deal with the [ exclusivity ] issue sooner than many analysts expect , " said Carton .
Last month , in fact , AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the exclusive agreement with Apple would not last forever , a clue that some read as indicating AT&T had not been able to reach agreement with Apple .
ChangeWave also polled a much smaller number of owners of the Palm Pre , that company 's attempt to revitalize its once - dominating place in the smartphone market .
The Pre 's satisfaction scores were cumulatively close to the iPhone 's , but the " very satisfied " and " somewhat satisfied " split was n't as positive :
The former received 45 % of the votes , while the latter got 42 % .
Even so , Carton said that the Pre 's rating , especially so soon after its launch , was " quite extraordinary . "
" It 's entered the pantheon of the top three with Apple and RIM , " he said , referring to Research in Motion 's BlackBerry .
Ironically , Apple and Palm have been tussling over iTunes , the former 's online music store .
Palm disguised the Pre as an iPod to iTunes in order to let Pre users synchronize their music using Apple 's software ; Apple retaliated by disabling the functionality , but Palm re-enabled the feature a week later .
Historians and military experts have contributed to the book Government artillery gunners may have hit their own troops while firing mortars into a Jacobite charge , a new book has suggested .
A chapter in Culloden : The History and Archaeology of the Last Clan Battle said the risk of friendly fire was a " very real one " .
Archaeologists found shrapnel from mortar shells close to where frontline infantry had stood .
Sites where fallen government soldiers were buried have also been discovered .
University of Glasgow's Dr Tony Pollard , who edited the book , said large pieces of shrapnel were found close to where the Barrel 's and Munro 's regiments were lined up against the Jacobites during the battle , near Inverness , in April 1746 .
Culloden still has secrets to give up
Dr Tony Pollard
University of Glasgow
He said : " Mortar shells were being dropped very close to the government troops and the risk from friendly fire must have been very high , and something not likely to be recorded in government accounts .
" It suggests the government troops on the left were under huge pressure and the mortars were fired on the Jacobites to break up their charge .
" There is a reference which we found late on that tells of mortar known as ' royals ' being brought forward to break up the Jacobite charge as it was starting to fall back . "
Dr Pollard said the precise location of where fallen government soldiers may be buried was a breakthrough as the graves had been previously unknown .
He said : " I believe a German coin dated 1752 and found in the Field of the English at Culloden was dropped by a soldier who was visiting the graves when they were still marked .
" The location also corresponds with a geophysics anomaly which suggests a pit . "
Musket balls
Researchers also uncovered clues which suggest the Jacobites were well armed with muskets - dispelling a myth that Charles Edward Stuart 's forces were mostly equipped with sword and targe .
They found hundreds of French calibre musket balls and a French - made bayonet .
Dr Pollard said there would be a margin of error with the sampling of the balls , but the number of finds showed the large number of firearms on the Jacobite side , including the use of Brown Bess muskets captured in early battles in which the Jacobites had been victorious .
The book , which will raise money for ex-services personnel charity Erskine , has chapters on the British Army , the battle 's significance and a collection of maps drawn by those who witnessed it .
Chapters have been written by historians and military experts Christopher Duffy , Stuart Reid , David Blackmore , Robert Woosnam - Savage , Jeffrey Stephen , Elspeth Morrison , Jill Harden and Daniel Szechi .
Dr Pollard said more details on the battle have yet to be unearthed .
He said : " Culloden still has secrets to give up . "

The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland/30

Summary
What does it mean that two identifiers are equal in a lexically scoped language with hygienic macros ?
This last episode of part V tries to answer the question , by discussing three different concepts of identifier equality .

Comparing identifiers
This is the last episode of part V of my Adventures .
In the latest episodes I have discussed various technicalities of Scheme macros , such as the concepts of syntax object , hygiene and lexical context .
There is still an important subject to be discuss in order to become really proficient with Scheme macros : identifier equality .
Equality of identifiers is one of the trickiest things in Scheme .
First of all , identifier equality is a compile - time concept which has nothing to do with the run-time concept of equality between variables .
Identifiers are not variables : they are syntax objects with an underlying symbol and an underlying lexical context , which are known statically at compile time .
It is possible to know if an identifier is bound or not at compile - time , but the value the identifier will be bound to at run-time is ( in general ) unknown .
Secondly , there is not a single concept of identifier equality , but different definitions are possible .
In this episode I will discuss three different predicates to compare identifiers : symbol - identifier= ? , bound - identifier= ? and free - identifier= ?
( the latter two are part of the R6RS standard ) .
symbol - identifier= ?
The simplest concept of identifier equality is expressed by the following symbol - identifier= ?
comparison function ( for convenience , I have added the symbol - identifier= ?
precedure to the ( aps lang ) library ) : ( define ( symbol - identifier= ? id1 id2 ) ( symbol= ? ( syntax -> datum id1 ) ( syntax -> datum id2 ) ) )
Two identifiers are symbol - identifier= ?
if they are equal as symbols , once their lexical information has been stripped out .
For instance , symbol - identifier= ?
can be used to find duplicated names in macros defining name -> value tables , such as the static - map macro I discussed in episode 22 .
Moreover , symbol - identifier= ?
can be used to reject reserved identifiers ( you may need such functionality if are building a mini- language on top of Scheme and you want to reject a few identifiers as language keywords ) , as in the following example : ( def-syntax ( check - reserved id ) ( syntax - violation ' check - reserved " Reserved identifier " # 'id ) ( exists ( cut symbol - identifier= ? # 'id <>) ( list #'reserved1 #'reserved2 ) ) ' non-reserved ) ( check - reserved id ) will raise a syntax - violation if id is one of the keyword reserved1 or reserved2 .
bound - identifier= ?
symbol - identifier= ?
is simple and easy to understand , but it can not be used in all situations .
Consider for instance the very first macro I wrote , in episode 9 : ( def- syntax ( multi - define ( name1 name2 ... ) ( value1 value2 ... ) ) #'( begin ( define name1 value1 ) ( define name2 value2 ) ... ) )
It is quite common to write macros defining multiple bindings , such as multi-define .
multi-define as written does not perform any check for duplicated identifiers , so that it relies on the standard behavior of R6RS scheme , raising an error .
However , the standard behavior only applies to programs and scripts , whereas the REPL is quite free to behaves differently and indeed it does in most implementations : > ( multi - define ( a a ) ( 1 2 ) ) ; in Ikarus , Ypsilon , ... a 2 ( in the REPL latter definitions override previous definitions ) .
If you are unhappy with that , you can introduce a bound - identifier= ?
check and raise a custom exception : ( def- syntax ( multi - define ( name1 name2 ... ) ( value1 value2 ... ) ) #'( begin ( define name1 value1 ) ( define name2 value2 ) ... ) ( distinct ?
bound - identifier= ?
#'( name1 name2 ... ) ) ( syntax - violation ' multi - define " Found duplicated identifier in " #'( name1 name2 ... ) ) )
Two identifiers are equal according to bound - identifier= ?
only if they have the same name and the same marks .
The name is misleading since the arguments of bound - identifier= ?
are not required to be bound identifiers ; a better name would be strict - identifier= ? .
You can check that multi-define correctly reject duplicated identifiers : > ( multi - define ( a a ) ( 1 2 ) ) Unhandled exception Condition components : 1 . &who : multi-define 2 . &message : " Found duplicated identifier in " 3 . &syntax : form : ( a a ) subform : #f
In this simple example using symbol - identifier= ?
would work too .
However this is not the geneal case .
Consider for instance the following macro expanding to multi-define : ( def-syntax ( multi - define2 id value ) #'( multi- define ( id id2 ) ( value ' dummy ) ) ) multi-define2 introduces a dummy identifier id2 .
Had we defined multi-define in terms of symbol - identifier= ? , calling multi-define2 with argument id equal to id2 would have generated a spurious name clash .
Fortunately , since we defined multi-define in terms of bound - identifier= ? , nothing bad happens : > ( multi- define2 id2 1 ) id2 1 bound - identifier= ?
works in this case because the identifier id2 introduced by the macro has different marks from the identifier id2 coming as an argument .
bound - identifier= ? is not good for every circumstance .
Consider for instance the following variation of multi-define , featuring a literal keyword as : ;; not checking for duplicated identifiers here ( define - syntax multi - def ( syntax - rules ( as ) ( ( multi - def ( name as value ) ... ) ( begin ( define name value ) ... ) ) ) )
This work , but the error messages could stand some improvement .
For instance , if an user misspells the infix identifier as , she gets a generic " invalid syntax " error , whereas we would like to provide a customized error message showing the misspelled literal identifier .
Using bound - identifier= ?
we could try to solve the problem as follows : ( def - syntax ( multi - def - bad ( name as_ value ) ... ) #'( begin ( define name value ) ... ) ( for - all ( lambda ( id ) ( when ( not ( bound- identifier= ? id #'as ) ) ( syntax - violation ' multi - def - bad " Offending infix syntax ( expected `as ' ) " id ) ) ) #'( as_ ... ) ) )
Unfortunately this solution does not work at all , since it raises an error even when the as identifiers are spelled correctly : > ( multi - def - bad ( x as y ) ( 1 as 2 ) ) Unhandled exception Condition components : 1 . &who : multi - def - bad 2 . &message : " Offending infix syntax ( expected `as ' ) " 3 . &syntax : form : as subform : #f 4 . &trace : #< syntax as >
The reason is that as is not bound - identifier= ? to #'as .
We need a less strict comparison predicate .
To this aim the Scheme standard provides another equality procedures for identifiers , free - identifier= ? , which however is not quite right .
free -identifier= ?
free - identifier= ? is the most complicated equality predicate .
I find its description in the R6RS document particularly confusing and the name is misleading since the arguments of free - identifier= ?
are not required to be free identifiers .
A better name would be lax - identifier= ? .
Two identifiers are free - identifier= ?
if they are both bound to the same binding and they share the same name ( or they shared the same name before renaming at import time ) ; they are both unbound and they share the same name .
In implementations with full phase separation , the identifiers must also be both bound / unbound in the same phase .
In all other cases the two identifiers are not free - identifier= ? .
Here is an example : > ( import ( only ( aps list - utils ) range ) ) > ( import ( rename ( aps list - utils ) ( range r ) ) ) > ( free - identifier= ? #'r #'range ) #t Notice that both symbol - identifier= ?
and bound - identifier= ?
would fail to recognize the identity of range and r in this case .
It is important to know about free - identifier= ?
because in macros with literal identifiers the literal identifiers are compared by using it , internally .
That explain a behavior which can be quite surprising .
Literal identifiers and auxiliary syntax Consider the macro multi-def defined in the previous paragraph .
This works : > ( let ( ) ( multi - def ( x as 1 ) ( y as 2 ) ) ( list x y ) ) ( 1 2 ) But this does not work : > ( let ( ( as 2 ) ) ( multi - def ( x as 1 ) ( y as 2 ) ) ( list x y ) )
Unhandled exception Condition components : 1 . &message : " invalid syntax " 2 . &syntax : form : ( multi - def ( x as 1 ) ( y as 2 ) ) subform : #f 3 . &trace : #< syntax ( multi - def ( x as 1 ) ( y as 2 ) ) >
That looks surprising , but it is not once you realize that internally literal identifiers are compared via free - identifier= ? .
In the second example as is bound , and therefore it is not free - identifier= ?
to the literal identifier #'as , which is unbound .
The recommended " solution " is to introduce at top level some dummy definitions for the literal identifiers you are going to use in your macro , and to export them .
Following this policy , the R6RS document defines a set of special macros , _ , ... , else and => , which lives in the global namespace and are available to all R6RS programs .
Such macros are used as auxiliary syntax in various special forms , like cond and syntax - case ; for this reason they are usually called auxiliary keywords .
The existence of such global variables makes it impossible to redefine them at top - level in scripts ( but it can be done at the REPL ) ; however they can be redefined locally , thus breaking the macros using the auxiliary syntax : > ( let ( ( else # f ) ) ( cond ( else ' something ) ) ) > ; does not return something I think this is fundamentally broken : literal identifiers should be a concept internal to the macro and they should not be exported .
The mistake is that the R6RS requires the literal identifiers to be matched via free - identifier= ? , whereas they should be matched with symbol - identifier= ? .
I never understood why the editors decided to use free - identifier= ? , perhaps because it makes it possible to rename the identifiers used as literal identifiers , a feature that looks of little utility to me .
All in all , I think free - identifier= ? is another dark corner of R6RS Scheme .

Suppose you lived in a hot and muggy climate and wanted to build a new house that was comfortable and energy efficient .
You came to me , a builder , and asked how we could dehumidify the house , and I told you to put a waterfall in your living room .
After you had fired me , I chased after you and convinced you to let me explain .
Yes , it does seem impossible that flowing water could take moisture out of the air , but this is no ordinary waterfall .
It has a special ingredient and it operates under one of nature ’s most powerful principles , the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
Read on for the science behind this phenomenon and a real - world example of a home - based waterfall in action .
Think back to your last ( and probably distant ) physics class and you will recall that in an isolated system , energy will tend to move toward entropy .
This principle is what activates and reactivates the work that living things get from gradients .
This is the “ surfing for free ” that I wrote of in my last article , and the living world is rife with examples .
Mine was of a tree pulling water from the soil by a gradient started by evaporation in its leaves .
The tree has a complementary gradient that aids this evaporative engine , and it is also based on the Second Law .
It is osmosis .
Within the cells of the tree ’s roots , for example , are selective membranes , letting some molecules , like water , pass through while blocking others , like salts .
When certain minerals reach high concentrations , water will flow into the cell to dilute the higher concentrations and reach an equilibrium on either side of the membrane .
The plant uses this to extract water out of the soil , sometimes overcoming tens of atmospheres of load to do so .
There are lots of other examples .
Soaring birds take advantage of convection currents or thermals , drifting larvae ride on similar fluid gradients initially stirred by winds created by temperature gradients .
Even prairie dogs have gotten wise and construct their homes with openings at different heights in order to set up a house breeze , courtesy of the Bernoulli effect .
Perhaps the most important energy gradient to all of us personally happens in our bodies at the cellular level .
In a previous article I mentioned a few key components in natural energy systems .
One is the standard unit of energy , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , which is a sugar - phosphate molecule that both plants and animals make and use to power their biological processes .
The power comes from the breaking off of one of the phosphates from ATP , thereby releasing the stored energy in the chemical bond .
This energy is then used to do other things in the cell , like building proteins .
Add another phosphate to the newly stripped adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and you are back in business with the original power unit , ATP .
This is going on now , as you read this , millions of times in each cell in your body .
What ’s fascinating to me about ATP is how it is made , and its manufacture depends on a gradient .
Whether in the mitochondria of animals or the chloroplasts of plants , the molecule is made by the closest thing that nature has to a turbine , the ATP synthase , a spinning rotor embedded through the membrane of either organelle .
This rotating enzyme cluster is powered by hydrogen ions ( protons ) flowing into the mitochondrion , like water passing through a millwheel .
The spinning generates energy to make our standard power unit , ATP .
The rotor can go in reverse as well , this time powered by ATP from the inside , pumping protons out of the mitochondrion .
This gradient of hydrogen ions on either side of a membrane is maintained by the organelle .
The mitochondrion , for instance will pump up the concentrations of ions outside in order for them to rush through the ATP synthase rotor , just as a child at the beach refills her plastic waterwheel to make it spin .
Again , physical things may tend to equilibrium , but living things are busy maintaining dis-equilibrium , because that ’s what does all the work .
Our waterfall is in good company , therefore , and it , too , is going to save you energy by surfing the Second Law .
It , too , is going to take advantage of concentration differences , and molecules traveling from higher to lower concentrations and pressures .
Its secret ingredient is calcium chloride added to the water .
Calcium chloride , a salt , is a dessicant , just like table salt and the grain of rice that you put in the shaker to keep it flowing freely .
It is hygroscopic , meaning it attracts water molecules from the air by absorption or adsorption .
What we have here is a liquid dessicant system , a wet flowing feature that can suck the water out of your indoor air for a lot less energy .
These systems have been used in the commercial and manufacturing sector for many years , reducing ice formation , mold growth and other consequences of moist air .
Unlike standard compressed air conditioners they do n’t have to work to lower air temperatures enough to precipitate water out and then use more energy to raise them back up for comfortable living .
The waterfall idea comes from a clever group of students and faculty at the University of Maryland who recently used it in a model green residence , turning a functional mechanism into an aesthetic feature .
For their efforts they were awarded second place for their LEAF House in the 2007 U.S. Department of Energy ’s Solar Decathalon .
As in all of our examples , there is a point when energy must be used to keep the dis-equilibrium going .
The mitochondrion must pump more ions out , the bird must flap to reach the updraft , the child must refill the waterwheel .
In this case , the dessicant becomes diluted with the water it has harvested from the air , the gradient stops and the excess water must be purged out of the system .
The LEAF House team , as is typical in these systems , solved this by heating the water to evaporation and venting this outside , a so - called regeneration phase of the system .
To reduce their energy costs , they used solar hot water heaters to do the job rather than electricity .
With the dessicant concentrated again , it is ready to do more work pulling water out of the air .
As in many passive and semi- passive climate control systems , the efficiency devil is in the details .
Its Coefficient of Performance ( COP ) , or ratio of output to input will depend on many different factors like temperature ranges , contact surfaces and flow volumes .
It is , however , a cyclical , gradient - powered and mostly passive air conditioning system and it does a great job of employing one of nature ’s most powerful principles .
In my next article I will write about an architect who has designed and built two award - winning buildings that put many of these thermodynamic principles to very useful work indeed .

" Joining the ERM II , practically is a political issue " , the senior economist at the Open Society Institute Georgi Angelov said , asked by euinside co comment on the report of the Greek Eurobank about the stability of the currency board of Bulgaria .
He also explained that technically , our country should file a request to join , all member states together with the ECB should gather and decided unanimously which was the problem the last time Bulgaria tried to enter the ERM II , because then the ECB voted against .
" So this is a political issue - the needed trust must be formed which should show that when our country joins it wo n't be a factor if instability bu the opposite .
This means that it wo n't be easy politically and diplomatically .
Simply , it is very difficult for us to think that a country , given as an example of a corrupt state , will join the ERM II than Poland " .
Georgi Angelov also said that Bulgaria should heal its political relationship with the EU , to decrease significantly the thefts of public money and to improve the judiciary .
To the reaction of euinside that this would take quite a long time , the analyst specified that everything is a matter of trust :
" The question is to create confidence that we are moving into this direction .
We would hardly be able to start working effectively right away - but we have to create a sustainable trend that we are making the steps in this direction .
Only then we will be able to enter the ERM II and only then the Maastricht criteria will be estimated .
This means that , first , we will have to enter , then start fulfilling the Maastricht criteria and then join the euro area .
We have 1 step which we can not skip .
Even if we fulfill the Maastricht criteria now , which is not impossible next year , for example , this would n't matter simply because no one who has not entered the ERM II cannot join the euro area " .
Regarding the question whether Bulgaria should join the euro area with or without the currency board , Georgi Angelov agrees that our country should not change its financial system because any other measures might lead to destabilization of the Bulgarian financial system .
" They do not include the effects of what is being discussed about removing the currency board .
Because , practically , the minute the government would announce its intention to remove the currency board , everyone would go to the banks to withdraw the money and change it into euro and this means that the proposition itself will tear the system down .
In other words this would create systemic crisis and we will follow Latvia on our fault .
I guess that this argument did not occur to the authors of the report because they had probably missed to take into account that people in countries with currency board have different expectations about their currency rate - they do not expect it to change .
The minute it 's being changed , they act immediately which is fatal for the banking system " .
The authors of the report of the Greek bank also write that probable devaluation of the Latvian national currency ( the lat ) will reflect badly on the countries in Central and Eastern Europe , which , according to Georgi Angelov , will have only psychological effect .
He said that there is no direct connection between the Baltic region and that around Bulgaria .
But he warned that talking about lat devaluation is generally a speculation .
To avoid any negative effect on Bulgaria 's financial system , he recommended total distinction from Latvian economic and financial policy .
Our country should show more sound policy than that of Latvia and this might help avoiding any dare consequences .
( CNET ) -- Surprise !
Facebook has acquired FriendFeed , a Bay Area - based social - network feed aggregation start - up .
FriendFeed consolidates updates from social media and bookmarking sites , blogs and RSS feeds .
" Facebook and FriendFeed share a common vision of giving people tools to share and connect with their friends , " FriendFeed co-founder Bret Taylor said in a release .
" We can't wait to join the team and bring many of the innovations we 've developed at FriendFeed to Facebook 's 250 million users around the world . "
TechCrunch reported the news on Monday , a matter of minutes before Facebook confirmed the acquisition .
I 'm going to go out on a limb and say it :
This is not as ridiculously huge of a deal as the Silicon Valley hype machine is going to have you believe .
Basically , FriendFeed has been coasting on a lot of hype and not a lot of mainstream recognition , and it's not a bit surprising that it would be seeking an exit at this point .
Facebook acquired it for its talent ; prior to FriendFeed , Taylor was part of the team that helped launch Google Maps .
So the real story here is that Facebook made the rather expensive hire ( and we do n't know the terms of the deal ) of some very talented former Googlers .
FriendFeed 's co-founders " will hold senior roles on Facebook 's engineering and product teams , " according to the release , and the rest of the company 's 12 employees will also join Facebook .
This would also be consistent with Facebook 's minimal past acquisition history : the company bought little - known start - up Parakey two years ago with the primary objective of getting its founders , the creators of the Firefox browser , on board .
It 's also well - known that Facebook tried hard to acquire Twitter -- which would 've been a far more significant acquisition than FriendFeed -- and was turned down .
( Well , there was also ConnectU , whose assets Facebook acquired pretty much just to get that pesky lawsuit off the table . )
The release from Facebook repeatedly hinted that this is about talent more than product .
" Since I first tried FriendFeed , I 've admired their team for creating such a simple and elegant service for people to share information , " Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the statement .
" As this shows , our culture continues to make Facebook a place where the best engineers come to build things quickly that lots of people will use . "
Yup .
" As we spent time with Mark ( Zuckerberg ) and his leadership team , we were impressed by the open , creative culture they 've built , and their desire to have us contribute to it , " said FriendFeed co-founder Paul Buchheit , another ex-Googler who was instrumental in building Gmail .
" It was immediately obvious to us how passionate Facebook 's engineers are about creating simple , groundbreaking ways for people to share , and we are extremely excited to join such a like - minded group . "
But Facebook director of product Christopher Cox said to CNET News later , " I would n't call it a talent acquisition . "
He elaborated , " We really have a vision that 's focusing on Facebook being not just a destination but being a service .
...
We think FriendFeed 's been focused on how that 's going to work in an open way , and that 's something we 're excited about , not just the people but the product they 've built . "
FriendFeed earned praise from prominent voices in Silicon Valley -- most notably Robert Scoble -- but its aim to aggregate all of a user 's social networking activity feeds in one place did n't catch on with the mainstream .
But Facebook eventually began to mimic the FriendFeed model through upgrades to its central " news feed " feature , letting members pull in select third - party updates .
Bret Taylor said that FriendFeed was n't shopping itself around .
" We were n't up for sale .
We had a healthy amount of financing and a really efficient company , " he told CNET News .
" As we noticed our products were really converging in terms of product vision , we started having casual conversations with Facebook . "
It 's not clear what will happen to the FriendFeed service , because it sure sounds like Facebook is eager to get its team onto the engineering fast track .
" FriendFeed.com will continue to operate normally for the time being , " a post by Taylor on the FriendFeed blog read .
" We 're still figuring out our longer term plans for the product with the Facebook team . "
Taylor elaborated more to CNET News later on Monday : " Anything that we would do would be more of a transition , not shutting down .
I think our users have invested in our product by putting their data in it , sharing it with their friends .
... We absolutely would n't shut ( FriendFeed ) down . "

Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab went into detail about events at Mumbai 's main railway station
By Prachi Pinglay
BBC News , Mumbai
Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab 's confession took everyone by surprise - even his own legal team .
As news of his confession spread , the Mumbai courtroom became packed with reporters .
The shock came on Monday morning , when the court was in the process of recording evidence .
The suspect told the judge he wanted to say something .
After speaking to his lawyer very briefly , Mr Qasab said : " I accept my guilt . "
Judge M L Tahiliyani asked him to what was he pleading guilty .
Mr Qasab admitted that he had carried out the firing at Mumbai 's railway station in November 2008 .
MAIN QASAB CHARGES
Waging war on India Murder Conspiracy to murder Destabilising the government Kidnap Robbery Smuggling and possessing illegal arms and explosives
Profile : Mumbai suspect Tears and smirks in the dock
The judge then heard arguments from prosecution and defence lawyers over whether a confession could be recorded at this stage of the trial .
When it was noted by the court that he could indeed make the confession , Mr Qasab proceeded to give a detailed account of how he and nine others came to Mumbai from Karachi last November , and the training that led up to it .
Speaking for several hours , he first described what happened when he and accomplice Abu Ismail entered the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus ( CST ) railway station .
" In CST , Abu Ismail and I started firing at the public there with our AK - 47 rifles .
Ismail was throwing grenades also .
I was firing , " he said .
" We went ahead towards the hall .
The police caught up with us at the time and started firing at us .
We retaliated .
Ismail took position behind the trains which were parked .
I took position behind him .
I fired at the police . "
He then described how they left the station and headed to the Cama hospital - confronting four people in one of the wards .
" Ismail told them to lie down first with their hands on the back .
While three agreed , the fourth did n't .
Ismail told me to lock them up in the bathroom .
I told them not to create any commotion . "
From the hospital , he said , the two men were involved in a gun battle with the police before his arrest at the city 's sea front .
Mr Qasab also told the court about how he got to know of the " weapon training " , how he joined the Pakistan - based Islamist militant group , Lashkar - e - Taiba , and how he completed different levels of training before he was sent to Mumbai .
We were not expecting this .
We were all shocked when he made a plea of guilt
Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam Seeming to be unaware of the exact plan , he told the court : " I asked Abu Ismail how will we go back .
He said , you do not worry about it . "
During his description of the training Mr Qasab gave names of other people suspected of involvement in the plot , such as Abu Hamza , Abu Kahfa , Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi and Abu Jundal .
He said Abu Jundal was an Indian .
He said two people ran away in the last stage of training .
' Right direction '
Mr Qasab , dressed in the traditional white pyjamas known as kurta , was calm and precise in his descriptions .

He smiled several times during the recording of his statement , gesturing with his hands as he described places and recounted incidents .
At times , when the court asked him to repeat certain statements , he would listen keenly to what was being recorded .
" We were not expecting this .
We were all shocked when he made a plea of guilt , " said prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam .
" It is for the court to decide whether to accept his plea or not .
It was all of a sudden .
The court is now recording his plea . "
The defendant 's lawyer , Abbas Kazmi , said he was not aware of his client 's plan .
" I barely spoke to him on Friday and did not meet him over the weekend .
In fact I was working on getting different books for him , which he wanted to read .
I do n't know when he decided to make a confession . "
Mr Qasab himself told the court he did not confess earlier as Pakistan had not admitted he was a Pakistani national .
When he came to know that Pakistan had accepted that he belonged to Pakistan , he decided to confess .
The court said the recording of his statement is now complete and the prosecution and defence can make their statements on Tuesday .
The court will then decide whether to accept his plea .
The chief minister of Maharashtra state , Ashok Chavan , welcomed the change of plea .
The confession meant the case would come to an end soon and " the mastermind behind the 26/11 conspiracy will come before the world , " he said .

Charity worker Zarema Sadulayeva and her husband were found dead
The head of a Russian charity and her husband have been found dead in Chechnya a day after their abduction , activists and officials said .
The bodies of Zarema Sadulayeva and her husband were found with gunshot wounds in a car boot near the Chechen capital Grozny , the interior ministry said .
Armed men seized the two on Monday from the offices of Ms Sadulayeva 's charity , Let 's Save the Generation .
The case follows July 's abduction and killing of activist Natalia Estemirova .
Ms Sadulayeva and her husband Alek Djabrailov were in their mid-20s and had just got married , reports say .
Their bodies were found in the boot of Mr Djabrailov 's car in the Chernorechye suburb of Grozny early on Tuesday , an official at the Chechen prosecutor 's office said .
The official , quoted by the Itar - Tass news agency , said the armed kidnappers had been wearing camouflage uniforms .
Let 's Save the Generation helps children affected by violence in Chechnya and works closely with the United Nations Children 's Fund , Unicef .
Murder cases
The southern Russian republic was ravaged by war between local separatists and Russian forces in the 1990s .
Ms Estemirova was a prominent campaigner who had been investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya for Memorial .
She was found dead shortly after being bundled into a car outside her home in Grozny .
Her killing provoked an international outcry .
Memorial 's chairman has accused Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov of involvement in her death .
In a radio interview last week Mr Kadyrov denied the accusation , but denounced Ms Estemirova as a person " without honour , merit or conscience " .
In recent years many of Mr Kadyrov 's most prominent critics have been shot dead , including Ms Estemirova and investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya .
He denies any involvement in their murder .
There have been murders or attempted murders in Chechnya , Moscow , the Middle East and Austria .
One victim , a former bodyguard , accused Mr Kadyrov of being personally involved in killings and torture .
Linux developers have issued a critical update for the open - source OS after researchers uncovered a vulnerability in its kernel that puts most versions built in the past eight years at risk of complete takeover .
The bug involves the way kernel - level routines such as sock_sendpage react when they are left unimplemented .
Instead of linking to a corresponding placeholder , ( for example , sock_no_accept ) , the function pointer is left uninitialized .
Sock_sendpage does n't always validate the pointer before dereferencing it , leaving the OS open to local privilege escalation that can completely compromise the underlying machine .
" Since it leads to the kernel executing code at NULL , the vulnerability is as trivial as it can get to exploit , " security researcher Julien Tinnes writes here .
" An attacker can just put code in the first page that will get executed with kernel privileges . "
Tinnes and fellow researcher Tavis Ormandy released proof - of - concept code that they said took just a few minutes to adapt from a previous exploit they had .
They said all 2.4 and 2.6 versions since May 2001 are affected .
Security researchers not involved in the discovery were still studying the advisory at time of writing , but at least one of them said it appeared at first blush to warrant immediate action .
" This passes my it 's - not - crying - wolf test so far , " said Rodney Thayer , CTO of security research firm Secorix .
" If I had some kind of enterprise - class Linux system like a Red Hat Enterprise Linux ... I would really go check and see if this looked like it related , and if my vendor was on top of it and did I need to get a kernel patch . "
This is the second time in less than a month that a serious security vulnerability has been reported in the Linux kernel .
In mid July , a researcher alerted Linux developers to a separate " NULL pointer dereference " bug that put newer versions at risk of complete compromise .
The bug , which was located in several parts of the kernel , attracted plenty of notice because it bit even when SELinux , or Security - Enhanced Linux , implementations were running .
More about the latest vulnerability is here , and additional details about the patch are here . ®
Description :
Peter Kropotkin's classic article on anarchism from the eleventh edition of Encyclopædia Britannica .
Anarchism is " the name given to a principle or theory of life and conduct under which society is conceived without government - harmony in such a society being obtained , not by submission to law , or by obedience to any authority , but by free agreements concluded between the various groups , territorial and professional , freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption , as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being . "
As fears were growing about the link between hormone therapy and breast cancer , a drug company paid the University of Wisconsin to sponsor ghostwritten medical education articles that downplayed the risks , records obtained by the Journal Sentinel show .
The five articles were funded by Wyeth , the company that made the top - selling hormone therapy products .
The articles , published in 2001 , appeared under the names of doctors who specialized in diseases common to menopausal women , but actually were written by professional writers paid by the company .
The articles came shortly before a long - term $ 1.5 million arrangement between Wyeth and UW to educate doctors and patients around the country about hormone therapy .
The initiative promoted the benefits and softened the risks of drugs that produced sales of more than $ 1 billion a year .
The five articles alone reached up to 128,000 doctors and other clinicians who could get medical education credit by reading the reports and taking a quiz .
" These articles contributed to widespread prescription of hormones to women who did not need them , but who were put at risk of blood clots , breast cancer , and other adverse effects , " said Adriane Fugh - Berman , associate professor of physiology and biophysics at Georgetown University Medical Center , a pharmaceutical industry critic .
Doug Petkus , a Wyeth spokesman , said there was no evidence that Wyeth ever supported articles that it knew were false or misrepresented the science .
" The bottom line is that the authors of the articles in question exercised substantive editorial control over the content of the articles and had the final say , in all respects , over the content - all of which was scientifically accurate , " Petkus said .
Although Wyeth 's financial contribution to UW was supposed to be unrestricted , Petkus acknowledged that Wyeth executives played a role in producing the articles .
" Wyeth employees did provide suggestions , " he said .
" Were those suggestions put into the final version of the articles ?
I do n't know . "
Earlier this month , court records involving litigation against Wyeth were unsealed by a federal judge .
The records show dozens of Wyeth - funded papers - including those involving UW - were actually written by Design - Write , a New Jersey medical communications company .
The records were provided to the Journal Sentinel by Cleveland attorney James Szaller , who spent four years investigating Wyeth on behalf of women who got breast cancer after using the hormone products .
The records show that DesignWrite orchestrated various aspects of the articles from developing the topics to writing the text to submitting them for publication .
" DesignWrite is responsible for writing and editing the papers as shown in the outline , " Rosie Lynch , Design - Write 's vice president for scientific affairs , said in one of the unsealed documents .
" We will arrange and coordinate all activities with the CME ( continuing medical education ) provider , University of Wisconsin School of Medicine as well as the journal . "
These revelations call into question the validity of UW 's Council on Hormone Education , which also was assembled by DesignWrite and paid for by Wyeth .
The five articles were written by members of the hormone council .
Wyeth paid $ 12 million for the hormone therapy education project .
UW got $ 1.5 million of that .
Well - published writers
Both the 2001 articles and articles produced by the hormone council were reviewed for the university by Julie Fagan , a UW doctor and associate professor of medicine .
Fagan said she was disturbed when she first learned of the company 's practices in June , when she gave a deposition in the court case .
" I find myself wondering about every medical article I read , certainly studies sponsored by industry , " she said in an e-mail to the Journal Sentinel .
The doctors on the hormone council were all distinguished , well - published writers , she said .
" So , I , like doubtless many readers , assumed they had written the articles themselves , " she said .
" I probably should have been more skeptical going into the project . "
George Mejicano , director of UW 's continuing medical education program , said the medical school was not aware of Wyeth 's role in preparing the ghostwritten articles .
" Had we known , we would not have allowed employees of a commercial interest to be involved in creating CME content , " he said in an e-mail .
Clinical trial stopped
The 2001 articles were done at a time when many women and their doctors increasingly were concerned about hormone therapy causing breast cancer .
Less than a year later , a large clinical trial would be stopped early when the drugs were found to increase the risk of breast cancer .
Doctors say the practice of ghostwriting continues to be commonplace .
James Stein , a UW cardiologist , said he was approached twice in the last week to put his name on educational material for different drug companies .
He said he turned down both offers because , " frankly , it 's plagiarism . "
" If an undergraduate did this , he would be expelled , " Stein said .
When a drug company puts a doctor 's name on an article that actually was written by a professional writer , it is able to present a more biased and promotional version of an issue as though it were coming from an independent source , Stein and others say .
The company 's ultimate goal is to sell more drugs , said Steven Miles , a physician and professor at the Center for Bioethics at the University of Minnesota Medical School .
" These ghostwritten articles are advertising masquerading as scientific reviews , " he said .
" It 's dishonest . "
One of the listed authors , Leon Speroff , then a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health Sciences University , actually thanked the DesignWrite writer for writing the article .
" You did a super job of writing this paper - succinct and makes the points very well , " Speroff said in a May 2001 e-mail .
Speroff is listed as the author of an article titled , " Inconsistency in Epidemiologic Findings on Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy and Breast Cancer . "
Speroff , reached at his home in Oregon , said the practice of ghostwriting remains commonplace , and he defended it .
" There is nothing dishonest about it , " he said .
He laughed at the idea that someone might be offended by the lack of transparency .
" If you do n't like the way it works , that 's your business , " Speroff said .
Practice defended
In January , the Journal Sentinel reported that both Wyeth and DesignWrite got letters from U.S. Sen.
Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) requesting information about how the articles were assembled .
Each of the five 2001 articles sponsored by UW involved breast cancer and hormone therapy .
The articles appeared in a supplement to the journal Women 's Health in Primary Care .
The articles were titled " Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy and Breast Health : A Review for Clinicians . "
Michael Platt , president of DesignWrite , said in an e-mail the articles were scientifically accurate and the doctors had editorial control over the content .
UW reviewed and approved the articles for balance and objectivity , he said in an e-mail .
At the time the articles were published , he said , it was not the norm to disclose the names of those who " provided editorial assistance to physicians . "
He also said it was an acceptable industry practice to offer a courtesy review to the drug company .
In January , the Journal Sentinel first reported on Wyeth 's funding of UW 's hormone council .
From 2002 to 2008 , the school 's hormone council offered the online course to thousands of doctors .
Even after the course was no longer available , the Web site and course material remained on the Internet , accessible to consumers and doctors .
The university dropped the site Jan. 15 , one day after the Journal Sentinel began questioning UW officials about the propriety of the program .

I am being kept busy with some
Work so comics may be sparse for the next week or two .
Hun­dreds of teenaged poets , flanked by coach­es and advi­sors , have packed into the ornate Grand Ball­room at the School of the Art Insti­tute of Chica­go on July 14 .
Com­pris­ing 50 teams , with entourages of up to 30 peo­ple , they have come from as far away as the Unit­ed King­dom and Guam .
‘ It ’s difficult because I feel like a lot of poets are trying to write things for social justice , ’ says Kass Levy .
‘ But if you do n’t have that personal connection to it , then the poem suffers for it . ’
The poets , aged 13 to 19 , are rep­re­sent­ing their cities in the 12th annu­al Brave New Voic­es Inter­na­tion­al Youth Poet­ry Slam Fes­ti­val .
Over the next five days , they will per­form three - and - a - half minute poems on top­ics rang­ing from immi­gra­tion to urban vio­lence to envi­ron­men­tal justice .
There are signs of civic pride – most­ly in team shirts or , in the case of the team from Den­ver , match­ing gold lamé head­bands – but most of the young poets are wear­ing this year ’s offi­cial fes­ti­val t‑shirt , the back of which bears a quote from slain Black Pan­ther leader Fred Hamp­ton : ​ “ Let me just say : Peace to you , if you ’re will­ing to fight for it . ”
“ We want [ the poets ] to appre­ci­ate the words and actions that have gone before them , ” says Youth Speaks Exec­u­tive Direc­tor James Kass , ​ “ and know that they ’re part of a con­tin­u­um of writ­ers and activists and edu­ca­tors , that they ’re step­ping into it and this is their time . ”
While com­pe­ti­tion and artistry are cen­tral to the event , spo­ken word is also deeply polit­i­cal , and the fes­ti­val is a way to voice the youth per­spec­tive , build com­mu­ni­ty and dia­logue about social jus­tice .
​ “ It ’s a way to con­nect with prob­lems that go on in our inner cities and even in our sub­urbs that are not talked about , ” says Mil­ton McK­in­ney III of the Chica­go All - Stars team .
​ “ They ’re brought to a high­er plateau and peo­ple all over can relate to them , and it makes peo­ple get clos­er to what ’s going on . ”
Cen­tral to the fes­ti­val are social jus­tice - ori­ent­ed events , includ­ing a youth town­hall forum , an envi­ron­men­tal­ly focused slam called Speak Green , and the Life Is Liv­ing fes­ti­val , a com­mu­ni­ty par­ty that pro­motes eco-jus­tice and an end to urban vio­lence .
Speak Green and the Life Is Liv­ing project are the brain­chil­dren of poet and per­former Marc Bamuthi Joseph , who seeks to bring minor­i­ty voic­es to the green movement .
“ The envi­ron­men­tal cri­sis real­ly par­al­lels a lot of the oth­er things that are hap­pen­ing , ” says Michael Cirelli , who coach­es the Urban Word team from New York City .
​ “ This real­ly broad­ens the sphere of [ young people ’s ] activism , because aside from chal­leng­ing the inequities in their school sys­tem and their com­mu­ni­ties , now they are actu­al­ly see­ing how the envi­ron­ments in these places are also dis­pro­por­tion­ate­ly under - served and under - pro­tect­ed in many cases . ”
Nolan Eskeets , a poet rep­re­sent­ing the San­ta Fe Indi­an School , per­formed a piece at Speak Green called ​ “ The Boy Dreams , ” about the dam­age ura­ni­um min­ing has inflict­ed upon the Nava­jo Nation .
His soft - spo­ken demeanor became stern as he read : ​ “ He embraces Sister / ​she swings from Father ’s ven­omous hands before sit­ting to dinner / ​her kid­neys will fail . ”
Eskeets has been using the poem as a means to net­work with envi­ron­men­tal advo­ca­cy groups .
​ “ If the right peo­ple are lis­ten­ing , then obvi­ous­ly some­thing will man­i­fest , ” he says .
‘ Life Is Living ’
On July 18 , res­i­dents of Chicago ’s Uptown neigh­bor­hood were greet­ed with pound­ing march­ing band drums and impas­sioned chants as slam par­tic­i­pants and com­mu­ni­ty mem­bers took part in the Life Is Liv­ing fes­ti­val parade .
Marchers car­ried poles with green ​ “ street signs ” bear­ing the name of a Chica­go youth slain this year .
The parade wound up in Claren­don Park , where the fes­ti­val con­tin­ued with break­danc­ing com­pe­ti­tions , sports tour­na­ments and guer­ril­la the­atre .
Mean­while , graf­fi­ti artists paint­ed vivid sus­tain­abil­i­ty - focused murals , which Bamuthi Joseph will install in 16 loca­tions around Chica­go to unite the com­mu­ni­ty and pro­vide a tan­gi­ble reminder of the event ’s message .
A num­ber of hip - hop artists per­formed , includ­ing Pharoa­he Monch , Chicago ’s Rebel Diaz and slam cir­cuit leg­end Saul Williams .
​ “ Once [ the poets ] find their voic­es , they are their own heal­ers , they are their own community ’s heal­ers , ” Williams says .
​ “ So all we ’re doing is try­ing to con­nect them to their own source . ”
Young poets ’ society
Kevin Cov­al , founder of the annu­al Chica­go youth slam Loud­er Than A Bomb and emcee of the BNV finals says the slam has a democ­ra­tiz­ing effect .
​ “ For young peo­ple to see what it ’s like to be from Guam or from a reser­va­tion in the South­west or a city in the North­east or from Chica­go , I think that kind of era­sure of the fear of the Oth­er hap­pens in this work , ” says Cov­al , an occa­sion­al In These Times contributor .
The con­ver­sa­tion may have a ten­den­cy to repeat itself and become inter­nal­ized , Cov­al says , but he thinks the move­ment has done a good job of bring­ing in new peo­ple .
Poets draw inspi­ra­tion from a vari­ety of sources and expe­ri­ences – hence the pro­fu­sion of ​ “ Where I ’m From ” poems , a sta­ple of most repertoires .
Many oth­ers opt to elab­o­rate on head­lines – almost always news sto­ries that affect­ed poets or were under - report­ed by main­stream media .
The Urban Word team brought crowds to their feet with ​ “ Switch , ” a poem about homo­sex­u­al­i­ty in the black com­mu­ni­ty , par­al­lel­ing the mur­ders of Matthew Shep­ard and Rashawn Brazell : ​ “ Fem­i­nine ten­den­cies wo n’t allow me to make a fist / ​A dev­il con­trol­ling my fore­arm to hang low like a lynched dream . ”
Though the team did n’t make the finals , audi­ence mem­bers were so moved by the piece that they demand­ed the poets per­form it at the Chica­go The­atre after the final competition .
But the most com­mon source for inspi­ra­tion is always per­son­al expe­ri­ence .
Sara Kass
Levy , a poet from Boston , recount­ed an expe­ri­ence with sex­u­al vio­lence through the lens of a bat­tle­field : ​ “ You kissed grenades over the war­zone of my collarbones / ​hissed hot bombs into my ear . ”
“ It ’s dif­fi­cult because I feel like a lot of poets are try­ing to write things for social jus­tice , ” Kass Levy says .
​ “ But if you do n’t have that per­son­al con­nec­tion to it then the poem suf­fers for it . ”
Across two oceans
The night of the finals , the mood in the green room at the Chica­go The­atre is ecsta­t­ic .
Poets greet each oth­er with hugs , freestyle and swap iPods as crowds clam­or to get into the the­ater and cheer on the four teams who have made the last round : Jack­sonville , Fla. , Hawaii , Bay Area and Leeds , U.K .
“ A fes­ti­val like this is all about cel­e­brat­ing truth and word and dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives , so it makes sense to bring in as much per­spec­tive in as pos­si­ble , ” says Joseph Buck­ley , a poet rep­re­sent­ing Leeds .
At the end of the evening , Team Hawaii is declared the win­ner , but there is no spe­cial pageantry .
As Cov­al is quick to remind the audi­ence , the win­ner of Brave New Voic­es gets noth­ing .
Every­one – poets , coach­es , audi­ence – dances through­out the the­ater , one last burst of com­mu­nal exuberance .
Team Denver ’s group piece was a fit­ting reminder of the festival ’s mis­sion : ​ “ Togeth­er , we are 21 feet , five - and - a - half inch­es tall / ​we are try­ing to make a difference / ​we are more than the sum of our skeletons … ”
The audi­ence erupt­ed in agree­ment with their clos­ing line : ​ “ We are not as small as you think . ”

IN THE frigid opening days of 2009 , Britain 's electricity demand peaked at 59 gigawatts ( GW ) .
Just over 45 % of that came from power plants fuelled by gas from the North Sea .
A further 35 % or so came from coal , less than 15 % from nuclear power and the rest from a hotch - potch of other sources .
By 2015 , assuming that modest economic growth resumes , a reasonable guess is that Britain will need around 64GW to cope with similar conditions .
Where will that come from ?
North Sea gas has served Britain well , but supply peaked in 1999 .
Since then the flow has fallen by half ; by 2015 it will have dropped by two - thirds .
By 2015 four of Britain 's ten nuclear stations will have shut and no new ones could be ready for years after that .
As for coal , it is fiendishly dirty : Britain will be breaking just about every green promise it has ever made if it is using anything like as much as it does today .
Renewable energy sources will help , but even if the wind and waves can be harnessed ( and Britain has plenty of both ) , these on - off forces cannot easily replace more predictable gas , nuclear and coal power .
There will be a shortfall — perhaps of as much as 20 GW — which , if nothing radical is done , will have to be met from imported gas .
A large chunk of it may come from Vladimir Putin 's deeply unreliable and corrupt Russia .
Many of Britain 's neighbours may find this rather amusing .
Britain , the only big west European country that could have joined the oil producers ' club OPEC , the country that used to lecture the world about energy liberalisation , is heading towards South African - style power cuts , with homes and factories plunged intermittently into third - world darkness .
In terms of energy policy , this is almost criminal — as bad as any other planning failure in New Labour 's 12 - year reign ( though the opposition Tories are hardly brimming with ideas ) .
British politicians , after all , have had 30 years to prepare for the day when the hydrocarbons beneath the North Sea run out ; it is hardly a national secret that the country 's nuclear plants are old and its coal - power stations filthy .
Recession has only delayed the looming energy crunch ( see article ) .
How did Britain end up in this mess ?
A free energy market needs more than one country
To the extent that successive governments had a strategy , it was on the face of it an attractive one : they believed in open energy markets .
Beginning in 1990 , the state divested itself of control of the energy industry .
Power plants were privatised and a competitive internal electricity market was set up .
Whereas most continental power providers , often state - backed , tied in supplies through long - term contracts ( notably with Russia ) , British firms happily tapped the North Sea and planned to top up as necessary on the open market .
This approach for the most part kept consumer prices down , but practical problems have long been clear .
Most obviously , the rest of Europe ( wrongly ) failed to liberalise wholeheartedly too .
The market is thus a highly imperfect one : Britain was unable to buy gas at any price in 2004 and 2005 , for example .
Meanwhile , without any clear guidance from the government , Britain 's electricity providers have had little incentive to start adding the sort of capacity that would help the system as a whole function more robustly — let alone diversify the sources .
Tony Blair spent most of his prime ministership running around the issue of nuclear power ( at the last minute deciding it was all right ) .
Asked about energy , Gordon Brown has tended to waffle on about his ( unfulfilled ) ambitions for renewable energy .
Nobody has been willing to discuss pipelines , terminals and power generation .
To make matters worse , the new capacity that is in the works is probably the wrong sort .
With no official energy policy , the power firms look sure to go for the easiest option — building more gas plants , which are cheap , relatively clean and quick to build .
Britain 's dependence on gas for its electricity seems set to rise from just under half to three - quarters in a decade .
Even if this new dash for gas happens fast enough to keep most of the lights on , which is by no means certain , it would leave the country overly reliant on one power source .
Electricity prices in Britain would be tied directly to gas prices , which can fluctuate wildly .
Although many sources of gas are already bound up in long - term contracts , optimists think Britain might be able to get more of it fairly easily .
Norway 's North Sea reserves have life in them yet .
New technology to capture gas from coalfields has recently boosted supplies , which could help keep prices down .
But those sources are unlikely to meet all the extra demand , leaving Britain in a position familiar to many of its neighbours : relying on Russia .
It is not just that relations with Russia are at their worst since the cold war ; Mr Putin 's crew seem more interested in terrorising their customers than developing new gasfields .
Brown out ; then come the brownouts
With gas too risky , coal too dirty , nuclear too slow and renewables too unreliable , Britain is in a bind .
What can it do to get out of it ?
At this stage , there is no lightning - bolt solution , but two things would prevent matters from getting worse .
The first has to do with infrastructure .
Companies must be cajoled or bribed into building gas storage .
At the moment there is barely a week 's worth , so there is nothing to lessen the impact of price rises and the shenanigans of foreign powers .
More cross -Channel power cables would help , allowing Britain to import electricity directly from its better - supplied neighbours ( and also helping create a Europe - wide power grid , thus improving security for all EU members ) .
Second , carbon must be taxed if firms are to invest in long - term , expensive , technology - heavy projects such as nuclear plants , cleaning up coal and taming renewable sources of power .
Carbon is already assigned a price through the European cap - and - trade mechanism , but the system is focused on the short term , vulnerable to gaming and plagued by hugely fluctuating prices .
A tax on carbon is hardly going to stop the lights going out in a few years , but it would provide a floor price for power , giving investors a clearer sense of likely profits .
In the meantime you know who to blame .
UPDATE - PirateBay is back , up and running from a new Service Provider .
But for how long — Till August 27th ?
NO – Why Pirate Bay Wo n’t R.I.P .
Not atleast Till Next Century
After the years of Lawsuits held against the Piracy Giant , today Swedish district court has ordered the Internet service provider ( ISP ) that used to power PirateBay , to stop servicing The Pirate Bay immediately or the ISP could face heavy fines of 500,000 Kroner ( $ 70,600 US ) a day .
The Pirate Bay ’s ISP had no choice but to comply and disconnect the website from the Internet .
If you are Torrent fan , no doubt you love PirateBay .
It ’s indeed a sad day in the history of P2P and File - sharing .
The most popular BitTorrent tracker in the world appeared to be inaccessible to many in the U.S. on Monday morning but the blog TorrentFreak reported that the site had found a new connection to the Web and there were reports from readers that they were able to log on to the site .
Citing a source close to The Pirate Bay , Torrent Freak said that the tracker was still down but would be back up on Tuesday .
The take down of The Pirate Bay comes 3 days earlier than expected , as the site was going offline on August 27 or legalize the site before then , which was unlikely to happen .
Black Internet ,
The Pirate Bay ’s largest bandwidth supplier is not the only connection to the Internet the website has , technically the website could go back online until other ISP ’s are sent cease and desist orders .
“ This is absolutely ridiculous .
The Court seems to consider themselves above the Constitution ” , said the leader of The Pirate Party , Rich Falkvinge .
As one of the world ’s largest torrent trackers goes offline , dozens more will surface in its place .
The Pirate Bay had over 25 million unique peers and 3.6 million registered users downloading from its website .
The future of The Pirate Bay is uncertain as the owners will face one year in prison and a fine of $ 2.4 million US .
A Mysterious Update : A Pirate Bay insider has told sources they have “ got a new connection to the net ” for their website .
The owners of the website were prepared for take down actions such as today ’s and have secured another Internet connection for the website , with minimal down time .
The Pirate Bay should return by tomorrow morning for almost all users .
The Pirate Bay team added this , “ The MAFIAA has spent millions of dollars and endless amounts of time to get this ban in order .
Our guess is that they also bribed a bit to get it since it violates so many laws not only in Sweden but also in the EU , not to mention violations against human rights .
And what do they have to show for it ?
3 hours of partial downtime . ”
An executive with Black Internet told Swedish newspaper SvD that the court informed the company that it would either shut off The Pirate Bay or face penalties .
The founders of The Pirate Bay were found guilty of copyright violations last April .
The executive told the newspaper that Black Internet is not the only ISP servicing The Pirate Bay but is probably the largest .
He said none of the other ISPs were affected by the decision .
He added that the company is considering options .
It ’s unclear how long Black Internet will be forced to stop service for The Pirate Bay .
The company may not be able to resume service until the appeal filed by The Pirate Bay founders is settled , SvD reported .
The news comes on the heels of a victory for the founders of The Pirate Bay .
Sweden ’s government run debt - collection agency , commonly referred to as the bailiff , said it could find no attachable assets belonging to three of the four founders of the site .
A group of media companies had asked the bailiff to collect the $ 4 million a court had awarded them after finding the four Pirate Bay founders guilty of copyright violations .
At this point , the future of the site , at least in name , appears to rest with the software maker Global Gaming Factory X , the software maker and operator of Internet cafes .
The company said in June it would pay $ 8 million to acquire The Pirate Bay and the deal is supposed to close on Thursday .
But Swedish regulators halted trading in Global Gaming on Friday over questions about the company ’s financial readiness to complete the transaction .
At the very least , the launch of a new Pirate Bay , one with authorized film and music copies , is unlikely to happen anytime soon .
But there is a good news for Pirates and Bad news for Authorities –
PirateBay backup exists – Several Terabytes of Torrent tracker data – and It ’s not hard to bring it up again .
It could be up anytime soon .
As per Torrentfreek.com –
The Piratebay moved their servers to the Netherlands and is ( almost ) fully functional .
They changed the title of the BitTorrent tracker to “ The Police Bay ” .

The search is on for a 22 - year - old Toronto man who police say was kidnapped by armed gunmen while driving in Scarborough Saturday .
According to investigators , Furqan Muhammad - Haroon was driving his van near Midland Ave. and Midwest Rd. , south of Ellesmere Rd. , around 3:30 p.m. when three men forced him off the road .
One man was armed with a gun , police said .
Police believe Muhammad - Haroon is alive .
The perpetrators did n't take his van , which was found not far from the intersection .
A family member reported the incident , police said .
" Right now we 're still in the preliminary stages and we 're really not sure exactly what led to this , " said Det. Karen Hunte .
" It 's a real mystery . "
A day after the alleged kidnapping , Hunte said there were no leads , no tips coming in and no ransom notes for the family , leaving police wondering whether it was a targeted attack or random incident .
Friends of Muhammad - Haroon , an electrical engineering student , are stunned .
" It could n't have happened to a more unlikely person , " said Habiba El - Sayed , a former schoolmate .
Another friend , Akash Chokshi , said that Muhammad - Haroon was never involved in illicit activity .
Described as soft - spoken , friendly and smart , the missing man has an impressive resumé , having worked at IBM and for professors at the University of Toronto .
He was also well known in his religious community .
Many friends found out about the abduction after it was announced following morning prayers at the Islamic Institute of Toronto , said Ammar Akhtar .
" Everyone is praying for his safe return in this sacred month of Ramadan , " wrote friends Ahmad and Abdullah Parekh in an email .
Muhammad - Haroon was last seen wearing a blue , long - sleeved crewneck shirt and dark blue jeans .
He is described as 5 - foot - 10 and 180 pounds with short , black , wavy hair , dark eyes and a beard but no moustache .
He wears glasses .
( STOP - do n't read the other part of that paper , the part about how little they really spend , it DOESN'T CONCERN THIS ARGUMENT !
We are taking THEIR argument at face value . )
They insist , as a matter of fairness to them , and to Americans who are paying more , that the other nations must drop their radical experiments in humanity , but I do n't think that would be possible because the national healthcare plans are very popular with their respective populations .
Well , then what can we do to stop the cost shifting on drugs ?
Obviously , the only option we increasingly can do is become more like them , and adopt the same cost controls .
( single payer , not public option )
Otherwise , how will we afford to buy drugs when we subsidize research for the whole world , ACCORDING TO THEM .
If so , our adopting strict cost controls is not our choice , they are FORCING us to do this .
meet a meme : SINGLE PAYER -
The DEVIL Made us do it !
So , all you politicians , you now have an GOOD excuse to support single payer , THE DEVIL MADE US DO IT .
We do n't HAVE that " choice " .
We do n't have any other " options " .
We are the odd one out , and American taxpayers are being exploited by the evil drug - discount forcers .
The sneaky foreigners who drive a hard socialistic bargain !
Grrrrrrrrr ....
The DEVIL of cost control in OTHER countries is FORCING US to adopt it too .
Just look at the graph , is n't it obvious !
Hallalujah , we will be free at last !
Anti-crime activists on Wednesday decried the slaying of a protest leader in northern Mexico who went public after his brother was kidnapped in May .
Benjamin LeBaron , 32 , and a brother - in - law were shot to death Tuesday after they were seized by gunmen in Galeana , a farming town in the border state of Chihuahua .
The attack bore signs of an organized - crime hit .
A message left with the bodies said it was retribution for the capture of 25 drug suspects in a neighboring town .
The arrests by Mexican soldiers reportedly came after an anonymous tip .
LeBaron , a U.S. citizen , had led a protest in May in the state capital , also called Chihuahua , after the kidnapping of his teenage brother , Eric .
The family refused to pay the $ 1 - million ransom ; the youth was eventually released .

Benjamin LeBaron had since spoken out on crime issues .
Last week , he took part in a convoy of residents to the state capital to denounce kidnapping .
The men killed Tuesday belonged to a community founded during the 1920s by breakaway Mormons after the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints began cracking down on polygamists .
The sect has a tumultuous and sometimes violent past .
In 1993 , a federal jury in Texas convicted three members of a sect offshoot in the slayings five years earlier of three former members and an 8 - year - old child .
Commentators said Tuesday ’s killings showed how risky it is to speak out against drug traffickers and other criminal gangs in Mexico .
“ Public complaints carry a lot of risk .
People who dare to do so are exposed to just what happened to this man , ” said Maria Isabel Miranda , an activist whose son was kidnapped in 2005 .

“ The criminals ’ message was unequivocal : Fear us , ” the El Universal newspaper declared Wednesday in an editorial about the Chihuahua slayings .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon declared war on drug smugglers and other crime groups when he took office in December 2006 .
But amid rising drug violence and kidnappings , Mexicans feel vulnerable .
Residents avoid reporting crimes because they do n’t trust police or worry that they will be exposed to retribution .
In a recent poll , 72 % of respondents said they feared being kidnapped .
Witnesses said more than 10 gunmen stormed LeBaron ’s home , seizing him and brother - in - law Luis Widmar , who had come to help .
LeBaron ’s brother James said the community did not want to be cast as crime fighters .
“ There ’s just so much insecurity here , we do n’t know what to think , ” he said Wednesday by telephone .
“ All we ’re trying to do is live safely . ”

Another Feynman Story
My masterpiece of mischief happened at the fraternity .
One morning I woke up very early , about five o'clock , and could n't go back to sleep , so I went downstairs from the sleeping rooms and discovered some signs hanging on strings which said things like " DOOR !
DOOR ! WHO STOLE THE DOOR ? " I saw that someone had taken a door off its hinges , and in its place they hung a sign that said , " PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR ! " - the sign that used to be on the door that was missing .
I immediately figured out what the idea was .
In that room a guy named Pete Bernays and a couple of other guys liked to work very hard , and always wanted it quiet .
If you wandered into their room looking for something , or to ask them how they did problem such and such , when you would leave you would always hear these guys scream , " Please close the door ! "
Somebody had gotten tired of this , no doubt , and had taken the door off .
Now this room , it so happened , had two doors , the way it was built , so I got an idea : I took the other door off its hinges , carried it downstairs , and hid it in the basement behind the oil tank .
Then I quietly went back upstairs and went to bed .
Later in the morning I made believe I woke up and came downstairs a little late .
The other guys were milling around , and Pete and his friends were all upset :
The doors to their rooms were missing , and they had to study , blah , blah , blah , blah .
I was coming down the stairs and they said , " Feynman !
Did you take the doors ? "
" Oh , yeah ! " , I said .
" I took the door .
You can see the scratches on my knuckles here , that I got when my hands scraped against the wall as I was carrying it down into the basement . "
They were n't satisfied with my answer ; in fact , they did n't believe me .
The guys who took the first door had left so many clues - the handwriting on the signs , for instance , that they were soon found out .
My idea was that when it was found out who stole the first door , everybody would think they also stole the other door .
It worked perfectly :
The guys who took the first door were pummeled and tortured and worked on by everybody , until finally , with much pain and difficulty , they convinced their tormentors that they had only taken one door , unbelievable as it might be .
I listened to all this , and I was happy .
The other door stayed missing for a whole week , and it became more and more important to the guys who were trying to study in that room that the other door be found .
Finally , in order to solve the problem , the president of the fraternity says at the dinner table , " We have to solve this problem of the other door .
I have n't been able to solve the problem myself , so I would like suggestions from the rest of us as to how to straighten this out , because Pete and the others are trying to study . "
Somebody makes a suggestion , then someone else .
After a little while , I get up and make a suggestion .
" All right , " I say in a sarcastic voice , " whoever you are who stole the door , we know you 're wonderful .
You 're so clever !
We can't figure out who you are , so you must be some sort of super - genius .
You do n't have to tell us who you are ; all we want to know is where the door is .
So if you will leave a note somewhere , telling us where the door is , we wil honor you and admit forever that you are a super - marvel , that you are so smart that you could take the other door without our being able to figure out who you are .
But for God 's sake , just leave the note somewhere , and we will be forever grateful to you for it . "
The next guy makes his suggestion : " I have another idea , " he says .
" I think that you , as president , should ask each man on his word of honor towards the fraternity to say whether he took the door or not . "
The president says , " That 's a very good idea .
On the fraternity word of honor ! "
So he goes around the table and asks each guy , one by one : " Jack , did you take the door ? "
" No , sir , I did not take the door . "
" Tim : Did you take the door ? "
" No , sir !
I did not take the door ! "
" Maurice .
Did you take the door ? "
" No , I did not take the door , sir . "
" Feynman , did you take the door ? "
" Yeah , I took the door . "
" Cut it out , Feynman ; this is serious !
Sam !
Did you take the door ... " - it went all the way around .
Everyone was shocked .
There must be some real rat in the fraternity who did n't respect the fraternity word of honor !
That night I left a note with a little picture of the oil tank and the door next to it , and the next day they found the door and put it back .
Sometime later I finally admitted to taking the other door , and I was accused by everybody of lying .
They could n't remembe what I had said .
All they could remember was their conclusion after the president of the fraternity had gone around the table and asked eveybody , that nobody admitted taking the door .
The idea they remember , but not the words .
People often think I 'm a faker , but I 'm usualy honest , in a certain way - in such a way that often nobody believes me !
Feynman .
CAIRO —
The specter of a U.S. nuclear umbrella for the Middle East haunted the U.S. - Egyptian summit this week .
In the run-up to President Hosni Mubarak ’s first Washington visit in five years , both the Egyptian leader and his senior aides categorically rejected an undeclared U.S. offer to guarantee defense of the region against atomic weapons as part of a comprehensive Middle East peace plan .
A nuclear umbrella is usually used for the security alliances of the United States with non-nuclear states such as Japan , South Korea , much of Europe , Turkey , Canada , and Australia , originating with the Cold War with the then Soviet Union .
For some countries it was an alternative to acquiring nuclear weapons themselves .
According to knowledgeable sources , the Egyptian President insisted with President Barack Obama on Aug. 18 that " what the Middle East needs is peace , security , stability and development , " not nuclear weapons .
In doing so , Mubarak reaffirmed Egypt ’s pledge underlying the country ’s commitment since 1974 for the establishment of a " nuclear - free Middle East . "
Pre-empting discussion on the issue , Mubarak said in an exclusive interview with the leading Egyptian daily Al - Ahram on Aug. 17 that " Egypt will not be part of any American nuclear umbrella intended to protect the Gulf countries . "
Such an umbrella , he said , " would imply accepting foreign troops and experts on our land — and we do not accept that . "
Mubarak also emphasized that a U.S. nuclear umbrella " would imply an implicit acceptance that there is a regional nuclear power — we do not accept that either . "
The Egyptian president asserted that " the Middle East does not need any nuclear powers , be they Iran or Israel — what we need is peace , security , stability and development . "
In any case , " we have not received any official communication regarding such a proposal , " he added .
On the same day , Suleiman Awad , spokesperson of the Egyptian Presidency , also commented on a U.S. nuclear umbrella in the region .
" This is not the first time the issue is raised ; it is part of the U.S. defense policy , " the presidential spokesperson said .
" What is new is that it is raised now for the Middle East . "
At the height of the Sino - Indian war that coincided closely with the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962 , the U.S. Administration under president John F. Kennedy made an informal offer of a nuclear umbrella to India at a time when the country felt constrained to seek U.S. military support to defend itself against China .
Commenting on alleged U.S. nuclear plans in the Middle East now , Awad said : " It is absolutely rejectable both in form and content .
Instead of talking about a nuclear umbrella , the Iranian nuclear file should be dealt with ( in a spirit of ) dialogue and flexibility from both sides — the West , and Iran . "
He added : " Iran has the right to benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , like any other country signatory of the NPT ( Non-Proliferation Treaty ) , provided that it proves that its program is for peaceful uses . "
Mubarak ’s spokesperson then underlined : " At the same time , this must be accompanied , simultaneously , by a serious move vis-à - vis Israel ’s nuclear capacity , in order to avoid accusations of double standards . "
These remarks are in continuity with Egypt ’s 35 - year - long campaign aiming at the establishment of a " nuclear free Middle East . "
In 1990 , Mubarak revitalized the Egyptian initiative through a new , larger plan to declare the Middle East a " weapons of mass destruction - free region , " including nuclear weapons .
The Egyptian initiative has drawn support from most Arab countries and has been recently reaffirmed by Amr Musa , Secretary General of the League of Arab States , representing all the 22 Arab countries .
Musa declared on Jul . 5 : " It is a must to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons . "
Arab support for the " nuclear - free Middle East " initiative has gathered added strength particularly in the Gulf Arab countries in the wake of the U.S. , Israel , and Europe alleging that Iran intends to build nuclear weapons .
Iran has systematically refuted these allegations , assuring that its nuclear program is meant for peaceful use and nuclear power generation .
The U.S. , Israel and Europe are adamant that they will not allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons .
This avowal contrasts with the positions of Russia and China , who do not want a nuclear armed Iran but opt for other ways to prevent this from happening .
The Arabs also have more doubts than certainty about Iran ’s alleged intentions to development nuclear weapons .
The Western view has been implicitly challenged by the new Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Yukiya Amano of Japan .
He told reporters Jul. 3 after his appointment that he did not see " any hard evidence of Iran trying to gain the capability to develop nuclear arms . "
Asked by Reuters ’ Sylvia Westall whether he believed Iran was seeking nuclear weapons capability , Amano , veteran diplomat and senior non-proliferation expert , said : " I do n’t see any evidence in IAEA official documents about this . "
Two days later , in an exclusive interview with Kuwait daily Al - Anba ’ on Jul. 5 , the secretary general of the League of Arab States was asked whether Iran represented a " real threat " to the region .
" There is no documented evidence ( that proves ) the existence of an Iranian military nuclear program , " Musa replied .
" There is only one state ( in the Middle East ) that has nuclear weapons , and it is Israel , " the Arab League ’s chief stressed .
Although it started developing nuclear weapons in the mid-sixties , Israel ’s successive governments have systematically refused to deny or confirm the possession of a nuclear arsenal .
Nevertheless , the Stockholm International Peace Institute ( SIPRI ) ranks Israel as the sixth world nuclear power on the basis of the number of deployed nuclear warheads in January 2009 .
According to SIPRI figures , Israel is second only to the bloc of the five UN Security Council permanent members ( U.S. , Russia , UK , France , China ) , with more deployed warheads ( 80 ) than India ( 60 - 70 ) and Pakistan ( 60 ) .
North Korea is believed to have produced enough plutonium to build a small number of nuclear warheads , although it is unclear whether it has manufactured an operational weapon , says SIPRI .
Unlike the U.S. , Russia , UK , France and China , Israel is not a signatory to the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
However Israel is one of eight states which , as of January this year , possessed between them a total of more than 23,300 nuclear weapons , including operational warheads , spares , those in both active and inactive storage , and intact warheads scheduled for dismantlement , according to SIPRI .
" India and Pakistan , which along with Israel are de facto nuclear weapon states outside the NPT , continue to develop new missile systems capable of delivering nuclear weapons and are also expanding their capacities to produce fissile material , " SIPRI reports .
The SIPRI numbers have been questioned , however .
For example , former U.S. president Jimmy Carter recently declared : " Israel has 150 nuclear warheads , or more . "
Prestigious Egyptian journalist , writer and political analyst Mohamed Hassanein Heykal , who served as a close advisor to late Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat , says that Israel has 200 nuclear warheads .
The U.S. based Arms Control Association ( ACA ) , which was founded in 1971 as a non-partisan organization dedicated to promoting public understanding of and support for effective arms control policies , estimates that Israel posses between 75 to 200 nuclear warheads .
Egyptian army intelligence sources estimate the number of Israeli nuclear warheads as ranging between 230 and 250 .
Israel has never denied any of these reports and figures .
The Arab - backed Egyptian initiative is based on the fact that the sole nuclear threat in the Middle East is Israel .
A top Egyptian diplomatic source , who asked not to be named , told this reporter that Egyptian officials have always argued that the U.S. " lacks any legitimacy to demand Iran , which has not developed any nuclear weapon , halt its nuclear program , while treating the only proved nuclear power in the region with silky hands . "
The source said " this argument was put on the table " by Mubarak during his meeting with Obama .
" Egypt has always stated that had the U.S. pressed Israel to dismantle its nuclear weapons , it would have been now in a strong and legitimate position to stop any potential Iranian nuclear aspirations , " the source said .
The source recalled Arab League secretary general Musa ’s recent statement that " it is a must to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons — the existence of Israeli nuclear weapons violates the non-proliferation principle and encourages others to have nuclear programs . "
Hessam Zaki , spokesperson of the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , said earlier this month in a public statement that " Egypt has seized every possible opportunity to discuss , at all levels and in all meetings , that the Middle East should be declared a nuclear - free region . "
Egyptian officials point out that the U.S. - Egyptian summit has taken place at a point in time that seems appropriate to discuss nuclear disarmament .
Obama promised in Prague last April to work for a world free of nuclear weapons .
On Jul. 6 , the U.S. President signed an understanding with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow aimed at reducing a part of their stockpiles of nuclear weapons within seven years .
The Moscow understanding , which includes intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine - launched missiles is supposed to replace the 1991 Start I ( Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I ) , which expires in December this year .
The White House meeting came also in the middle of a worldwide campaign to reduce nuclear arms as a critical step towards their total abolition , which Japan , the sole country that suffered the consequences of U.S. nuclear bombs in World War II , has been actively promoting .
The appointment of an anti-nuclear Japanese to lead the IAEA is expected to add to Japanese civil society efforts for a world free of nuclear weapons .
The 12 million members of non-governmental organization Soka Gakkai International ( SGI ) in 192 countries have embarked on a broad - based campaign for nuclear abolition .
‘ The People ’s Decade for Nuclear Abolition ’ initiative created by SGI aims to rouse public opinion and help create a global grassroots network of people dedicated to abolishing nuclear weapons .
According to SGI president Daisaku Ikeda , " nuclear weapons embody an absolute evil that threatens humankind ’s right to live . "
Another major world campaign for nuclear weapons reductions towards nuclear abolition , called Global Zero , was launched in Paris in December last year by 100 political , military , business , faith and civic leaders cutting across political lines .
Their purpose is to shore up the two major nuclear powers in their declared intention to achieve a comprehensive agreement to eliminate all nuclear weapons worldwide through phased and verified reductions .
Global Zero is developing a step - by - step policy plan for the phased elimination of nuclear weapons , and is committed to building broad - based public support through worldwide media and online communications and civil society organizations .
The initiative ’s signatories have announced that they will convene a Global Zero World Summit bringing together hundreds of leaders in early 2010 , for abolition of what Global Zero campaigner Queen Nour of Jordan calls " the nuclear folly . "

I have another memory of Kurtzman .
A few years before he died , I was with him at a restaurant when he was having a brief meeting with an art director from an ad agency .
Kurtzman had accepted an advertising job to earn some much - needed cash .
I watched this iconoclastic humorist acquiesce as the art director altered everything Kurtzman had done , removing all the humor and leaving only the style .
Maybe it ’s a good thing the authors were unaware of this anecdote ; their book is probably better off without it .
Underground cartoonists of the ’60s and ’ 70s knelt before two deities : Harvey Kurtzman and Paul Krassner .
Kurtzman you know about .
Krassner was the editor and publisher of The Realist , considered the first underground - ­press periodical , a product of the Beat and anti-McCarthy movements .
While The Realist was rather conventionally designed compared with the psychedelic underground newspapers that began springing up during the mid- to late ’ 60s , it was more ribald and raucous than anything in print — scandalous , borderline libelous and even pornographic .
It was the next evolutionary step in counterculture satire after Mad .
And it is cited by Jay Lynch , an underground cartoonist known for the strip “ Nard ’n Pat , ” in the introduction to James Danky and Denis Kitchen ’s Underground Classics : The Transformation of Comics Into Comix ( Abrams ComicArts / Chazen Museum of Art , $ 29.95 ) .
As Lynch says , The Realist bitingly attacked “ the sham and hypocrisy of society at large ” and was one of a few magazines that contributed to the rise of the underground comix sensibility .
This collection of essays , reproductions of original art , and mechanicals of comics pages and covers is a nice complement to the Kurtzman book .
Primarily the catalog for a traveling exhibition , it includes images that will be familiar to anyone who grew up with the under­grounds and captivating to those who did not — a good substitute if you ca n’t see the exhibition .
I was happy to be reintroduced to Dope Comix ; Spain Rodriguez ’s Trashman , one of my favorite antiheroes of the day ; and Gilbert Shelton ’s “ Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers ” ( the Abbott and Costello of the dope generation ) and “ Billy Graham Reaches the Dope Mystics . ”
But the book is worth the price if only for the superb reproduction of Rick Griffin ’s “ Fighting Eyeballs . ”
Griffin , who rendered the original Rolling Stone magazine logo in the ’60s , was Hieronymus Bosch on mushrooms , as evidenced by his astonishingly precise surreal assemblage of eyes fighting eyes in a sci- fi dystopia .
Griffin died in a motorcycle accident .
Yet many of the other artists , currently in their 60s and 70s , are still quite active .
This is not ( as the title suggests ) the definitive collection of all their classics , but it is a satisfying representation of some of their greatest hits .
The visual language of rebellion has a few commonalities that are adapted to individual cultures and countries .
The images in Zeina Maasri’s Off the Wall : Political Posters of the Lebanese Civil War ( I. B. Tauris / Palgrave Macmillan , paper , $ 29.95 ) are stylistically similar to some of the underground comics created in the ’60s .
But the messages in Lebanon from the ’70s to the early ’90s were decidedly more serious than those in the United States .
Underground comics were concerned with sex and drugs , among other favored themes ; the Lebanese activists were concerned with survival and victory .
American undergrounders faced nightsticks and Mace when they demonstrated against government policy ; the Lebanese factions used lethal weapons .

It was worse .
Back in the bad old days of Bush ’s corrupt gang , we on the left were pilloried for suggesting that the administration was manipulating terrorism - related news in order to win the 2004 elections .
But when Tom Ridge says it . . .
In fact , I argued in summer , 2004 , that when Ridge did raise the terrorism alert , it had the unfortunate effect of outing an al - Qaeda double agent who had been turned by the Pakistani government and was helping set a trap for al - Qaeda in the UK .
In turn , that caused the British government to have to move against the people it had under surveillance prematurely , harming the case .
Ridge is alleging he was pressured on the eve of the election .
But I still wonder about the circumstances of the summer announcement .
He might have been being used then , too , and not known it .
And if any of us had said that Dick Cheney was setting up civilian mercenary assassination squads ( at least 007 works for the British government ) , and set things up so that perhaps neither the CIA director nor the president even knew about it , we would have been branded moonbats .
But well , that is today ’s story
You shudder to think what has n’t come out yet .
If Bush and his gang falsely put up the terror alert or even tried to , for partisan political gain , that is a sort of treason .
If they thereby ruined a British surveillance operation , they recklessly endangered US and NATO security .
If they were arranging for civilian mercenaries to murder people . . . well you ’d have to say that they were at least planning to be murderers .
( The wingnuts will say that Xe was only being contracted to kill al - Qaeda types ; but the wingnuts would n’t be able to tell a Barelvi from an al - Qaeda supporter if their lives depended on it , and I would n’t exactly trust Mr. Prince to be fair to Muslims . )
The horrible thing is that Wolf Blitzer on CNN assembled David Frum and Frances Townsend , former members of the Bush administration , to sit around on his afternoon news and analysis program on Thursday afternoon and more or less either call Ridge a liar or pooh - pooh the significance of what he is saying .
There was n’t a single centrist or left of center voice to show any outrage .
I mean , I know that Time Warner is not made up of people who necessarily care about the little person or social justice or anything .
But a little bit of shame ?
It is n’t enough that the corporate media lied to us for Bush for 8 years , they are continuing to do it .
Give money to Amy Goodman .

In the evenings , Donna Munson liked to sit in front of her picture window and watch the bears amble toward her Ouray County log cabin for dinner .
The 74 - year - old woman — who stocked her backyard with dog food , fruit and yogurt — was found dead outside her home Friday , being eaten by a bear .
It was still unknown Saturday whether a bear killed Munson or whether one or more animals consumed part of her body after her death .
But people who knew her said she was an eccentric wildlife lover who had been feeding bears , elk , skunks and raccoons for years .
Munson , who rented half of her home in southwestern Colorado to several people over the years , told one of them that “ when the time came , she wanted to go out with the bears . ”
“ She was a very sweet lady , ” said Tammy York of Paonia , who rented part of Munson ’s house several years ago .
“ She just loved nature .
She probably should n’t have been alone out there in her state . ”
Colorado Division of Wildlife agents had asked Munson so many times over the past decade to stop feeding bears that she quit taking their phone calls or accepting their certified letters and tried to ban them from her property .
Neighbors complained about a growing number of bears in the hills , ransacking trash cans and even trying to break into houses this summer .
Still , Munson kept feeding the bears .
Two of the bruins were shot and killed by Ouray County sheriff ’s deputies Friday while they investigated Munson ’s death .
Deputies said the animals were threatening and had no fear of people .
Two other bears were captured and euthanized in July after a caretaker at Munson ’s cabin complained they were too aggressive .
Division of Wildlife authorities caught them both the first day they set traps .
“ We tried to do everything possible to gain her cooperation , ” said Tyler Baskfield , DOW spokesman .
“ Obviously , this is a situation that everybody feels bad about , but it illustrates what can happen . ”
Bears fed by humans lose their instinct to fear people and “ they expect that food source to continue , ” he said .
“ Not only are you putting yourself at risk , you ’re putting anyone else who may come in contact with that animal at risk because they are expecting a handout , ” Baskfield said .
The night before her death , Munson planned to feed an injured baby bear hard - boiled eggs and yogurt , another former tenant said .
And she had planned to swat a large bear that was bothering the baby bear with a broom .
“ She did n’t have a chance in hell , ” said Connie Barnes , who lived with Munson for five years and never went outside after dark without a spotlight , her husband and his BB gun .
Munson lived in the cabin , which bordered federal land , with her husband , “ Ridgway Jack , ” until his death about 14 years ago , Barnes said .
Jack Munson adopted a baby elk and made their home into an animal sanctuary , even letting a fawn sleep in his bed , Barnes said .
Donna Munson continued caring for animals after her husband ’s death , leaving a tub of cat food on her picnic table for critters and tossing food in the backyard and out her windows for bears .
The elderly woman , who used a walker , bought giant bags of Ol ’
Roy dog food for the bears and had pallets of grain delivered for elk and deer , Barnes said .
“ She had skunks that came in her house , ” Barnes said .
“ It sounds ridiculous to people , but you had to know her .
She was a very loving woman , so much into animals . ”
Two women who cleaned Munson ’s home found her being eaten by a bear Friday , Barnes said .
A necropsy performed on a 250 - pound male bear was inconclusive .
A necropsy on the other bear killed Friday is ongoing .
The Montrose County coroner is performing an autopsy on Munson .
Folks in Ouray and Ridgway , two towns near Munson ’s house , were upset about the bear deaths and the public safety risk caused by Munson .
“ These bears are now not going to be fed and they are going to go to other houses looking for food , ” said Kate Singer , owner of Kate ’s Place , a cafe in downtown Ridgway .
“ More bears are going to be killed because of what this woman did .
It ’s a bad situation , and people are not happy about it . ”
Munson had enclosed her porch with wire fencing for protection .
York , her former tenant , said Munson had the fence installed when York and her two children , ages 1 and 4 at the time , moved in with her .
The bears would come within 6 feet of the porch and peer in the windows .
“ We were in the zoo , ” she recalled , saying she moved out after about a year because the animals — especially the skunks — “ got to be too much . ”
While she lived there , a bear busted York ’s car window and left bite marks in her seat trying to get some leftover french fries .
Munson would be devastated by the bears ’ deaths , York said .
“ That ’s the worst part , ” she said .
“ That would be horrible for her if she knew what her death had meant to the bears . ”

So what kind of teachers could a school get if it paid them $ 125,000 a year ?
An accomplished violist who infuses her music lessons with the neuroscience of why one needs to practice , and creatively worded instructions like , “ Pass the melody gently , as if it were a bowl of Jell - O ! ”
A self - described “ explorer ” from Arizona who spent three decades honing her craft at public , private , urban and rural schools .
Two with Ivy League degrees .
And Joe Carbone , a phys ed teacher , who has the most unusual résumé of the bunch , having worked as Kobe Bryant ’s personal trainer .
“ Developed Kobe from 185 lbs. to 225 lbs. of pure muscle over eight years , ” it reads .
They are members of an eight - teacher dream team , lured to an innovative charter school that will open in Washington Heights in September with salaries that would make most teachers drop their chalk and swoon ; $ 125,000 is nearly twice as much as the average New York City public school teacher earns , and about two and a half times as much as the national average for teacher salaries .
They also will be eligible for bonuses , based on schoolwide performance , of up to $ 25,000 in the second year .
We have been working on this costume for about a month and are nearing completion - should have it completed by March 14 .

Christianity Sucks A Frank Discussion on Dealing with Christians
Freedom of Religion , Freedom of Speech
First I will say that I believe that every person on the planet has a right to believe in any religion , no matter how stupid it is .
I also believe that every person has a right to free speech and a right to talk about stupid religions and why they are stupid , even if " people of faith " get offended .
Just because I respect your right to practice your stupid religion does n't mean that I have any respect for it , not do I have to pretend your religion is n't stupid and / or is n't a dangerous and destructive cult .
If you are offended by frank discussions of religions , you can leave now .
I find Christians particularly offensive .
Everyone is going to burn in Hell except them .
They have no respect for any other religion .
In fact , most Christians hate most other Christians .
The Pentecostals think the Catholics are all going to burn in Hell .
It 's a very dishonest religion and has a holier than thou culture where they believe they are better than everyone else .
They like to pose as persecuted , but more often than not they are the persecutors .
They tend to lie and steal a lot because they are " forgiven " and therefore can indulge in sin .
The religion is theoretically based on the Bible which is , quite frankly , a stupid book , and certainly not written by a God .
But Christians hardly follow their own teachings and are more likely to cheat and steal than your average person off the street .
A Religion Based on Fear and Judgment
The core of Christian belief is based on the idea that everyone has sinned , and because you have done anything wrong that God will punish you by burning you with fire , or otherwise torturing you forever .
If a 5 year old tells a lie and then dies , God will burn that kid in Hell forever .
Out here in the real world , if someone behaved like God supposedly does , that person would be severely mentally deranged .
We put people who behave like God in jail or mental institutions .
In fact , many people are locked up every year for imitating the " Wrath of God " .
If Jesus could see what Christianity has evolved into , he'd be spinning in his grave !
Even though God created the universe and created billions of us , and he's all powerful and all knowing , he seems to have an identity problem and is so insecure that he needs us to worship him .
Kind of like a kid shaking his fist over and ant colony demanding to be worshiped and obeyed , but on a much larger scale .
God loves us , but needs to punish us , unless we worship him .
It 's like God is some southern hick child abuser or something .
Maybe we should call family services on God for child abuse ?
Anyhow , Christians believe God has a God sized ego problem and needs us to worship him or he throws fits like destroying the world and such .
God does n't seem to have much control over his behavior and often is controlled by his own strong emotions .
God does n't seem to really care much about what you do , but in what you believe in .
It 's " faith " not " works " that impress God .
So , a mass murder who gets " saved " during his lethal injection will go to Heaven , but the Dalai Lama is going to burn in Hell .
So , you can be bad all your life and change at the last minute and get into Heaven .
Christians obviously think God is pretty stupid and will fall for something like that .
Actually , they do n't " think " that because you 're not supposed to think .
you got to " have faith " to believe something that stupid .
Faith is the belief in something that has no basis in logic or reason .
The bottom line is , Christianity is about the fear of going to Hell .
They say it 's about " love " to , but hey , people who love you do n't torture you in Hell forever , so I 'm not buying the " he loves you " crap .
And even though God created the universe , he 's just not very good with money , and he needs you to give him your cash .
God was a lot more out there in ancient times than he is today .
God likes to work behind the screens , being the invisible guy in the sky , and let the churches do his work .
He does n't talk directly , so he need babbling nut cases to speak for him , ( in tongues ) , with another nut case interpreting it .
God is rather impotent these days and is authority seems to be limited to getting even with you after you 're dead .
So God needs his army of Christian Soldiers to do his work for him .
The Chosen Few
God is n't powerful enough to save everyone , so only the " chosen few " make it in .
The Jehovah 's Witnesses have set the number at 144,000 people , and that 's it .
Only Christians get in , and then it's limited to only " True Christians " .
A True Christian is your personal flavor of Christianity and most all other Christians are not really Christians , but are really working for the Devil .
Satan seems to have more influence here than God does .
Satan is some fallen angle who somehow suckered God way back when and got power .
I guess someone stupid enough to believe a death bed conversion can fall for anything , and is n't very bright .
So Satan is misleading all but the chosen few who are True Christians and are going to Heaven .
This creates a dilemma .
With all the flavors of Christianity out there , how does a person find the True Christians ?
I guess you 're supposed to " know it in your heart " but there are a lot of Christians out there who are listening to God speak to their heart and getting a lot of conflicting information .
God is having a hard time getting his story consistent it would seem , or , you have Satan out there pretending to be God and if you are fooled , God is going to punish you .
Remember , God is one seriously pissed off dude and has no room for error !
So , unlike other religions , like Jews and Bhudists , Christians believe that Gods has chosen them and therefore they are better than everyone .
And because of that , they have no respect for anything other than their own limited and narrow perception of the world as their particular flavor of Christianity sees it .
Self Righteousness , Moral Superiority , and Mutual Ego Masturbation
Christianity is as much based on culture as it is on dogma .
Christian culture is rooted in the belief that you 're better than everyone else .
That because Christians are forgiven , they are " washed in the blood of the lamb " .
They are chosen , going to Heaven , while the rest of us are going to burn in Hell .
Christians are " morally superior " to the rest of us because " God is on their side " and the rest of us are " tools of Satan " we are " unclean " and we are " evil " while they are " clean " and " good " .
They believe the bottom line is , " we 're good , they 're evil " and therefore the rest of us are below subhuman heathens .
And they will tell you this to your face .
And it's ok if they do it , but is someone says that " Christianity is a cult for weak minded people " -- My God !
You 're persecuting Christ !
Since Christians are the chosen ones and they speak for God , then what they believe defines what it " moral " and what is " immoral " .
This having little to do with actual ethics , but there is some overlap .
Murder is generally considered a bad thing in all cultures .
Atheists and Realists agree with that .
But sex is considered immoral outside the context of Christian marriage , an in the case of Catholics , outside the context of reproduction .
Sex is not a form of amusement to Catholics and is look upon as a necessary evil to repopulate the planet .
Birth control is also considered a sin to many Christian cults .
Christian fail to realize that if sex were limited to the context of Christianity , the human race would have become extinct , which would however eliminate sin and keep God from getting pissed off .
Christian go to church mostly for the purpose of reinforcing their beliefs in their own self - righteousness and moral superiority .
There they can show off their " faith " in front of their fellow worshipers and participate in cult membership rituals so that they can feel secure that they are an accepted member of their tribe .
It allows them to reaffirm their beliefs through mutual ego masturbation , where members reaffirm to each other that they are God 's chosen few .
People speak in gibberish ( tongues ) and tell stories of miracles that never happen .
It 's pretty scary stuff when you realize that these people a really sharing a mass mental illness ritual that is further separating them from the real world and causing them to believe things and behave in ways that have no basis in reality whatsoever .
Christian Fetus Fetish
Another form of Christian Ego Masturbation is the fetus fetish .
On the surface Christian portray themselves as " God 's righteous army fighting the evil Satan worshipers who are slaughtering innocent little babies that result from their uncontrolled sexual urges . "
But in reality , Christians do n't care about " the baby " and once they get past preventing an abortion , the mother and child are on their own .
The real issue behind fighting abortion is that Christians believe that children ( bastards ) are God 's way of punishing women for being sluts .
Pregnancy is God 's way of punishing teenage girls for being sluts .
Pregnancy and being a young unwed mother label a woman as a slut and allow her to be used as a judgment object and someone to secretly be lusted after as a " bad girl in the church " .
They become objects of gossip and contribute much entertainment to the Christian community .
Abortion threatens this experience because is allows women to sin without punishment , and thus encourages women to do the Devil 's work ( have sex ) and get away with it .
It denies the sexual experience associated with the judgment of the fallen , and the men of the church have no clear way of knowing which young women are sexually active and perhaps available for extramarital activity .
So through Abortion , the congregation is denied the opportunity to take advantage of the young girls in their community .
The Abortion issue also gives Christians something to do , something to stand for , to create an identity around and issue .
Woman who are pregnant are very vulnerable , especially if they are young .
After all , what 's a 14 year old pregnant girl going to do ?
These young girls represent a sexual commodity and abortion turns them back into normal little girls again .
But they are an easy target , and Christianity is a religion for lazy believers who do n't want to have to work hard to get their moral fix .
Therefore picking on little girls becomes an easy job , as compared to ending poverty and feeding the homeless .
Sex , Death , and Denial
We , as humans like to think of ourselves as special .
The idea that we will die and simply cease to exits it a scary thought , and difficult to comprehend .
We want to think that this planet is more than a speck of dust in the universe among trillions of other similar planets were there may be billions of life forms more advanced that us .
We like to think of ourselves as above the animals and that somehow this planet is special , that humans are special , and that we as individuals are special .
Therefore , we are ripe for wanting to believe religions that tell us what we want to hear , rather than what 's true .
Christianity tells us what we want to hear .
That there is an omnipotent parent figure in the sky who watches out for us , loves us , and that we are special .
It says that we will never die , appeasing our need to believe we will live forever , in a better place , where all our problems go away .
Do I want that , sure !
Who would n't ?
But is it true ?
Unfortunately , no it 's not .
If you want to live forever you 'll have a far better chance by donating you money to genetic research than to a religion .
Something to consider the next time you write that check .
Sex is also a source of human denial .
We humans are above the animals , we would believe , and we do n't indulge in " instinct " because we are intelligent and we use " reason " and " logic " instead .
Yes , we do , but reason and logic are newcomers and instinct has been around a lot longer and is a lot more powerful .
And sex is the biggest example of behavior that put us right there with the animals .
It 's pure instinct and there 's very little difference in how we mate that every other creature that mates .
In many cases , we are n't even as good at it than the average male dog .
Sex is a necessary human function .
We are the decedents of 3 billion years of sex .
There are people who have risen above their instincts to control their sexuality , but those people are not our ancestors .
We are the decedents of those who failed to control their sexuality , or had no desire to control it .
It 's an instinct homed by billions of years of evolution , and mush of our behavior is controlled by our sexual instincts .
Christianity is based on sexual denial and sex becomes the " work of the Devil " .
It equates sex with evil and irresistible temptations , caused by Satan , to steal the souls of Christians from God and subject you to eternal punishment .
sex is an easy target because when you 're not having sex , it seems like bizarre behavior .
Other instincts , like eating , breathing , drinking seem more natural and one would quickly die if denied .
Therefore sex is the best target for redefinition as sin .
But sex is life and without it we would n't be here , but Christians have criminalized human reproduction outside the domain of their control .
If sex is immoral , the life is immoral .
Evangelism and World Domination
Since Christians are right and everyone else is wrong , Christians are mandated to expand their cult to try to include everyone in the world .
They want Christian controlled governments to enforce their Christian way of life on the masses and have the authority to punish the non-believers .
The idea of personal rights and liberties is contrary to surrendering your life and free will to Jesus and doing " his work " as dictated by the church .
After all , if you 're not serving Christ , you 're serving Satan , and you are the tool of the Devil and serving an evil purpose .
So the idea of personal liberty and free thinking is the same as giving rights to Satan to be evil .
Something God would never approve of , but seems powerless to stop .
The omnipotent creator seems to have to rely on us mere mortals to do his work for him , and we , according to Christianity , have that task of winning souls over to Christ .
So it 's ok to repress the heathen non-believers because we heathens are the enemy of God.
Obviously , Satan is working through me right now making me write this , and you 're being influenced by Satan in reading it .
Pray that you do n't believe a word I say !
Christianity has no respect for any other religion , including other flavors of Christians .
Christianity is Irresponsible
Unlike most religions that hold you accountable for your behavior , Christian salvation is based on what you believe .
it 's you 're faith , not your works , that get you into Heaven .
Christian are " forgiven " their sins , therefore Christians can go out and sin , and get away with it .
However , Christians are n't supposed to sin .
Sin is the Devil working through you and is considered a bad indicator as to the state of your " faith " .
So sin is discouraged , but there is no direct relationship between your behavior and judgment because you 're not judges on what you did ( wrong ) but on what you believe in .
This allows Christian to have two standards of behavior , what they are supposed to do , and what they are allowed to get away with .
Christianity caters to lazy and irresponsible believers who can continue unethical practices that most other religions would n't put up with .
Jews also believe in judgment , but judgment is tied to what you do , not what you say you believe in .
Jews believe that what you do is a true reflection as to what you really believe .
Eastern religions are similar except that instead of the Heaven / Hell / Judgement paradigm it 's about moving up and down the reincarnation ladder .
In general Christianity is a cult and a menace to society .
Christianity is also an ecologically irresponsible religion .
Christians believe that Christ is coming back and is going to destroy the world , and therefore it's ok to trash the planet because Jesus is going to destroy it anyhow .
This destruction is going to occur in our lifetime ... however , we did make it through Y2 K and Jesus is n't here yet , and if I were a Christian , I 'd be getting pretty nervous that Armageddon is coming any time soon .
Nonetheless , Christians do n't accept that this planet is a finite ball in space and it's our home ( for now ) and that we have to keep it clean and livable .
The biggest ecological threat we have is overpopulation .
Christianity is the enemy , in general , of responsible family planning , which includes access to abortions and birth control .
The church opposes the use of new technologies that empower women to have control and choice as to when they will reproduce .
Christianity considers sex a sin and that pregnancy to be a deterrent to sexual behavior , and to remove the penalty of pregnancy would result in increased sexual activity .
However , the church 's opposition to birth control , mostly by catholics , has resulted in overpopulation and has increased famine , disease , and death .
Christianity has not been the friend of preserving the limited resources of the planet .
Christianity as a Culture
Christianity is a " we 're better that you " religion that openly disdains all other religions , including other Christians .
It creates a highly exaggerated sense of self importance that is sustained by the oppression and judgment of others .
Christians see the world as a battlefield where God is at war with the Devil who are fighting this war through human surrogates with Christians as the good guys , and everyone else as the bad guys .
And since this is a holy war , all is fair .
It is ok for Christians to be dishonest in order to gain power to fight for Jesus .
For example , if a Christian were to kill me for posting this web page , publicly the churches would condemn it as murder and wrong .
However , in their heart they would be thankful that some one killed me because I am an instrument of Satan and therefore deserve to die .
I would be an enemy killed in battle .
At a minimum , they are out there praying for my soul , because I am lost and they are found .
From the perspective of a non-believer , I see Christians in general as self - righteous , hate filled , and indulging in behavior that is very bizarre .
If someone is speaking in tongues , either God is speaking through them , or they are so mentally ill that they are hallucinating that God is speaking through them .
Is God really speaking through them ?
Well , if God is all powerful , then can't he speak for himself ?
If not , God has a problem .
If so , then the Christian who thinks he 's speaking for God has a problem .
The bottom line is , Christianity is a cult .
( Actually , thousands of related cults )
And as a culture , it sucks .
In Summary
Christians have now problems talking about us non-christians as being evil and controlled by Satan , but they scream Christian persecution every time someone like me tells the truth about their religion .
They can say I 'm condemned to burn in Hell because I 'm a filthy sinner , but I 'm not supposed to say the Christianity is a dangerous mind cult that leads to delusional behavior .
It 's ok for them to envision a world rid of the non-christian heathens , but I 'm not supposed to envision a world where people have figured out what a stupid belief system Christianity is , and it goes away like the belief that the world is flat went away .
My religion supports free speech and the free exchange of ideas .
As I said , even though I believe that Christianity is a cult , that people have the freedom to be part of that cult .
But I 'm tired of being shoved around by Christian bigots who would oppress my freedom to talk about reality the way it really is .
Christianity sucks .
It 's a piss poor religion and I 'm tired of dealing with these in - your - face ass holes who mistakenly believe that they are God 's chosen people .
ChristianitySucks.com - Name Says it All !
You know , that thirty - three and a third or so , of whatever poll is current , identifying themselves as conservative and evangelicals in America , do n't get me wrong , both groups are certainly made up of fine people just taking care of their own , and if they shout and buy enough votes ( they as a group are pretty rich ... it's part of Christianity you know ) , and persevere they could actually get these guys elected .
If not by popular or electoral vote , by the Supreme Court , Sotomayor not withstanding .
It has happened before .
So , what would happen in the first hundred days ?
Increasing taxes on any couple ... married of course , making less than $ 64,000 a year , and greatly reducing taxes on those poor souls making more than $ 250 K ?
Removing ALL fiscal and ethical regulation on mega corporations ?
Doubling the defense budget ?
Those damn socialists , and ' Moslem ' terroists and ' Ruskies ' you know .
And purging any leftovers from the ' Bama administration including putting down Bo ... actually the dog might well be let loose in the Montana wilds to be hunted down by helicopter gun ships .
I 'm sorry , I 'm just being mean .
I 'm a cartoonist after all ... it 's part of my nature .
Not all that dissimilar from Mr. Hannity and Ms. Palin , ( fuck you Levi Johnston , you media whore ! )
Okay , okay ... it's satire , do n't freak out !

Last words
Before reaching the final line , however , he had already understood that he would never leave that room , for it was foreseen that the city of mirrors ( or mirages ) would be wiped out by the wind and exiled from the memory of men at the precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would finish deciphering the parchments , and that everything written on them was unrepeatable since time immemorial and forever more , because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth .

Sin embargo , antes de llegar al verso final ya había comprendido que no saldría jamás de ese cuarto , pues estaba previsto que la ciudad de los espejos ( o los espejismos ) sería arrasada por el viento y desterrada de la memoria de los hombres en el instante en que Aureliano Babilonia acabara de descifrar los pergaminos , y que todo lo escrito en ellos era irrepetible desde siempre y para siempre porque las estirpes condenadas a cien años de soledad no tenían una segunda oportunidad sobre la tierra .

So far , the researchers have n't come up with any specific applications for the new material , although they speculated that it could be used to create everything from combat uniforms that record when a soldier sustains a wound to flexible telescopes to chemical sensing clothing .
And of course , who knows what might happen once Alexander McQueen gets a hold of this stuff .
TCA Tour – “ The Late , Late Show with Craig Ferguson ”
When it comes to late - night hosts , I never thought I ’d hear myself say this , but …I have almost reached the point where I prefer Craig Ferguson to David Letterman .
When it comes to my all - time favorite , I do n’t think I ’ll ever see a day when Dave will be topped , but there ’s just something about Ferguson that comes closer to matching my current sensibilities .
In particular , I love the way the guy speaks off the cuff and from the heart .
It ’s not that other hosts ca n’t and do n’t step outside of the standard talk - show mold to address specific issues of the day , but Ferguson does it every day of the week and throughout the majority of his show , creating a feel of spontaneity where you truly have no idea what he ’s going to say next .
Plus , he has such a “ real person ” vibe that you know that , when he does say something , it ’ll sound like something that you might say .
Well , you know , if you had a Scottish brogue .
And were funnier .
The TCA has had a long - standing relationship with Mr. Ferguson , but I swear to you that his ongoing gesture of buying us pizza whenever we hold our organization ’s business meetings has nothing to do with my enjoyment of his show .
With that said , however , I ca n’t say that the messages that he includes with the pizza – like the one below – have n’t made me respect him more .
I mean , as someone who has an affinity to the printed word ( as opposed to the online word ) , I have to give him props for this :
Craig stopped by the TCA tour for what was described as an “ informal press conference , ” which is no doubt why he started the proceedings by saying , “ First of all , let me say my wife is standing by me through this very difficult time , ” adding that “ Buenos Aires is lovely at this time of year . ”
From there , he was willing to tackle any and all questions that were thrown at him , but before I offer up some of my favorite moments , I must drop this bombshell : he ’s considering getting rid of the puppets .
Yes , I know : I ’m as upset as you are .
And so were many of the others in attendance , several of whom immediately gasped in horror .
“ That reaction right there ? ” said Ferguson .
“ That ’s what I ’m looking for : controversy .
‘ No puppets ?
That ’s it !
To the presses … that do n’t exist anymore ! ’
I do n’t know , I ’m getting bored with puppets .
If I ca n’t think of anything else to do with them , I ’ll have to let them go the way of all flesh . ”
As you can imagine , we did our best to pretend that he never made this comment …
I do n’t think I want to live in a world where “ The Late , Late Show with Craig Ferguson ” does n’t provide me with my weekly puppet quota…and instead chose to focus on the funnier and more thoughtful bits of the “ press conference . ”
Here , then , are ten of my favorites …
1 . “ One of the luxuries of doing a television show every night …it ’s almost like you had an outlet of where you could just broadcast your thoughts .
Perhaps something on the Internet would be popular in the same way .
That ’s why I never would Twitter : because I ’ve got an hour to fill every fucking night .
What the hell else am I going go to say ?
‘ Going to say things about things . ’
So it ’s really just me doing that .
That ’s all it is .
And so I think there ’s a part of it which is retro , in the sense that it ’s someone just talking on television , which they used to do back in the day , and another part of it is extremely contemporary .
It ’s the broadcast of unedited thought … which is , you know , causing the newspaper shortage . ”
2 . “ The other night , I was talking about Dave ’s show , and I got the name of Dave ’s show wrong .
Now , what I could do ?
‘ Late Night with David Letterman ’ is what I said , which is apparently not the name of his show , and I got into trouble saying it .
Now , what ’s more interesting is to watch a sweaty vaudevillian try to get out of a situation like that rather than cut it and make it pristine .
I do n’t have the patience for that , and I would prefer as a viewer to watch the mistakes .
I am my own blooper reel as it happens . ”
3 . “ At 12 and 13 , I thought I would be an astronaut .
By 17 , I thought I would be dead by the time I was , you know , this age .
It ’s a constantly changing thing for me .
I think for everybody , I do n’t think just for me .
I always kind of half expected I ’d end up doing something in show business because it was tolerant of drunkenness and you could meet girls .
But , you know , I ’m married , and I ’m ‘ teetotals , ’ but I ’m still here because I do n’t know where else to go . ”
4 . “ I think my show is probably closer to ‘ Pee - wee ’s Playhouse ’ than anything else I ’ve seen , and that is an aspiration .
That ’s a great show .
I do n’t know where we are , but wherever we are , we wo n’t be that next week .
I do know that .
That ’s why the puppets wo n’t stay forever .
It ’s important to keep moving .
There was a point , you know , when I had a sound board , and I was always doing the sound board , and people asked about the sound effects .
Or there was the cheeky monkey thing .
We have to keep moving because I ’ll get bored , and if I get bored , then I think we start doing retakes when I make a mistake , and then the rote sets in , and then there ’s focus groups and then committees about ‘ I do n’t know about this joke . ' ”
5 . “ I do n’t want to be poor .
I do n’t want to be rich to the extent that all I care about is keeping my job .
I do n’t care enough about keeping my job right now .
That ’s good .
That makes me effective at what I do .
I do n’t want to be frightened of getting fired .
So , to that end , I suppose my ambitions are that I spend less than I earn .
I do n’t want to have the ambition of a time slot or a number of dollars .
Do I want to make a lot of money ?
Fuck , yeah .
But do I want to make it at the expense of …look , I ’ve met a lot of rich people who are douche bags .
I do n’t want to be that …or any more of that than is necessary .
So I hope to , I suppose , in some way try and maintain some … if I have any …type of integrity .
I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror .
That ’s my ambition . ”
6 . “ I watched Jimmy ( Fallon ) in his first week … maybe 10 minutes of it .
I remember during that time Jimmy Kimmel – who is a very nice man – gave an interview , and he said , ‘ We all watch and anybody of the late night guys says that they do n’t watch another show is lying . ’
So I guess I ’m lying , but the truth is I do n’t watch the other late night shows .
You know the shows I see ?
I see ‘ Duck Dodgers ’ and ‘ MythBusters . ’
That ’s what I fucking watch , because I ’ve got an eight - year - old son , you know .
I watched Jimmy , and I liked him .
I thought he was good , but I stand by what I said the last time : I never thought we were in competition , and I do n’t think we are in competition now .
The last time I talked to you guys , I said I thought Jimmy ’s competition was ‘ Adult Swim , ’ and I still believe that .
I think my competition is sleep .
Or the ShamWow commercial , or whatever the hell is on cable , or whatever video game .
I do n’t know .
I just do what I do . ”
7 . “ I do n’t really understand ( ratings ) .
When they say people age 18 - 34 , and then they go 18 - 49 , I said , ‘ Well , what ?
So the people in the 18 - 34 , are they in the 18 - 49 ?
Or is this different people that are not in the 18 - 34 ? ’
Then you go , ‘ Do all ratings stop at 49 ? ’
And they do .
You go , ‘ I ’m 47 .
So in two years , I ’m fucked .
Fuck you !
No ! ’
I do n’t really understand how it works .
I know it ’s important because everybody writes about it like it ’s religion , but all I know is this : the numbers can change dramatically , and people get pay raises .
Here ’s what I do know , and this is probably the wrong thing to say in a room full of journalists , but it seemed to me …
I do n’t know if this absolutely accurate , but when Jay was shit - canned from NBC , he was the leader in all numbers , and then they fired him .
I do n’t want to get fired .
So perhaps keeping your head down is what you should do with the numbers .
I do n’t understand how it works , but it clearly matters .
Yet I do n’t know why .
I think the truth of it is this : I think it makes you sound clever if you talk about them , and I think that ’s what a lot of people do .
I understand that .
I want to sound clever , too , but I swear to God , I do n’t understand it . ”
8 . “ What I think we ’ve been doing at this show … I hope what we ’ll be doing at the show is deconstructing and deconstructing and deconstructing the format , and the more we deconstruct the format , if we are successful in doing that , the more we separate ourselves for good or ill from the format .
The format is tired .
The format is tired , and it is old , and …look , here ’s the reality : I ’m another middle - aged white guy telling jokes late at night on TV wearing a suit .
And that ’s tired , you know ?
So I want to mess with it .
Because that ’s who I am , I want to mess with it .
I want to poke it with a stick .
I want to do it .
I swear , I do n’t know if I ’m part of it .
I kind of would like to be .
You know , I kind of like to be , ‘ Hey , what ’s going to happen with that ? ’
And then another part of me thinks , ‘ Well , then I ’ll end up like that .
Then I ’ll be important .
Then I ’ll be worried about the fucking 18 - 18 1/2 demographics . ’
And I do n’t want to be .
So I ’m conflicted a little bit with it , I guess . ”
9 . “ I ’d like to announce I got my pilot ’s license on Friday of last week .
And I ’ll tell you why I like aviation : because it is the complete opposite of show business .
In show business , you bullshit , you bullshit , you bullshit , and that ’s what you do , and that ’s how get ahead .
In aviation , you bullshit , you fucking die .
You ’re gone .
So when Andy says to you in show business , ‘ Can you do that ? ’
You go , ‘ You bet I can . ’
When Andy says to you in aviation , ‘ Can you do that ? ’
You better tell the truth , because if you can’t , you know , you ’re on the local news , and that ’s that . ”
10 . “ David Letterman , no matter what the numbers have ever been , ever , in the past … David Letterman is the king of late night television .
All right .
Now , I know there are press releases and other people that can prove to you scientifically that that ’s not fucking true , but
I ’m telling you , that ’s true .
I ’m very happy to work for him and to work close to him , but if there is a successor to Johnny , then , of course , it ’s David .
My relationship with David Letterman is that I sit at his feet .
I ’m kind of his bitch .
In the modern parlance , you know .
I sit at the feet of the master . ”
Teen Talk Barbie proved to be the final straw .
People who were already upset at Barbie ’s anorexic figure and her way of turning play into superficial consumerism could n’t believe their ears when Barbie ’s electric voice box giggled : “ Math is hard ! ”
“ I love shopping ! ”
“ Will we ever have enough clothes ? ” Snigglers to the rescue In 1989 the Barbie Liberation Organization was formed .
Taking advantage of similarities in the voice hardware of Teen Talk Barbie and the Talking Duke G.I .
Joe doll , er , “ action figure , ” they absconded with several hundred of each and performed a stereotype - change operation on the lot .
The surgery was no simple matter — circuit boards had to be trimmed , a capacitor moved , and a switch re-engineered .
The press made it sound like an easy pop-and - switch operation , but this took some research and dedication .
( A step - by - step explanation of the BLO method can be found in PDF format at this page )
The BLO returned the altered dolls to the toy store shelves , who then resold them to children who had to invent scenarios for Barbies who yelled “ Vengeance is mine ! ” and G.I. Joes who daydreamed “ Let ’s plan our dream wedding ! ”
Cleverly placed “ call your local TV news ” stickers on the back ensured that the media would have genuine recipients to interview as soon as the news broke .
One BLO member counted up the many benefits of their program : “ The storekeepers make money twice , we stimulate the economy — the consumer gets a better product — and our message gets heard . ”
Simon Beer has spent the past five years trying to convince himself that the Apocalypse will be fun .
Not that he calls it the Apocalypse .
His fellow survivalists call it TEOFTWAWKI ( The End Of The World As We Know It ) or the Long Emergency , the Collapse , the Shift or the Event , as in , “ There may be marauding bands of cannibals post - Event . ”
But Simon does n’t call it anything at all .
“ I guess I ’d call it ‘ When the oil runs out ’ , ” he says .
“ I do n’t really have a name for it . ”
So far this nameless thing has been far from fun : it has cost him his job , his relationship and his health , and it has n’t even started yet .
In the back garden of a modest Blue Mountains home sit the remains of Simon ’s meagre preparations for the Event .
Even before he became seriously weakened by fibromyalgia , a condition with symptoms that include whole - body pain , he was never the kind of survivalist interested in having a bunker full of tinned food and weaponry .
“ Those can just be taken from you by force , ” he says .
“ Skills , primitive skills , on the other hand , will be more valuable .
If your value is in your head , they ca n’t take it from you – and they ca n’t kill you , because you ’re too valuable . ”
In the moist dirt is a collection of sticks and cord , half - buried .
This is what ’s left of a broken - down ‘ mangle ’ trap .
Post - Event , it would be baited with meat and an animal hapless enough to pull at it would be crushed under a toppling log .
( Today a recycling bin takes the place of the log . )
Simon has never caught an animal .
“ I ’ve never even made friction fire , ” he says , picking at a muddied stick .
“ There were so many things I was starting to teach myself , before I got sick . ”
He does know which weeds are edible , though , and we eat some dandelions and an acrid - tasting sheep ’s sorrel leaf before going back inside .
Simon taught himself to read at the age of two .
At ten , he could explain the sub-atomic workings of a semi-conductor .
Later , his work in physics won him a university medal : “ I discovered two new star nebulae .
Very minor ones . ”
But he was already disillusioned by the academy , because “ a scientist is someone who finds out more and more about less and less , until they know everything about nothing . ”
After September 11 , he began to read about the theory of peak oil .
He was compelled by the idea that vast population growth has relied on cheap oil and that vast populations will use all the oil , or at least make it very expensive , resulting in massive , rapid population decline .
After a great deal of reading and thought , he could find no way around this impasse .
“ The attraction of civilisation fits so many of the characteristics of addiction , ” he says .
“ It has appeal .
It has immediate benefit and gratification .
It has hidden costs .
My mistake was trying to quit civilisation cold turkey . ”
For a time he tried to spread the word about peak oil , but soon realised that an end - of - the - world evangelist was just another Jeremiah .
He moved back to his mother ’s place in the Blue Mountains and started to learn the forgotten skills necessary to survive in the wild : cordage and fire - starting , bush tucker and shelter , trapping and tracking .
“ I really thought that unless I learned these skills I would die , ” he says .
“ I would n’t recommend that others embrace the idea with the same intensity I did . ”
Some survivalists arrive at their conclusions through rational thought alone .
Some want to renounce society in the manner of a hermit or a religious ascetic .
Some are driven by misanthropy , latent or fully expressed .
( Analogies between humans and vermin , humans and viruses , are common currency , often buoyed by a quote from Gore Vidal : “ Think of the Earth as a living organism that is being attacked by billions of bacteria whose numbers double every forty years .
Either the host dies , or the [ parasite ] dies , or both die . ” )
There are clues to what primed Simon for his conversion : his mother threw herself into rapture - heavy Pentecostalism ; his recalcitrant father built the family house .
But what finally sealed Simon ’s conviction was the fact that his beliefs seemed to trigger a personal cataclysm .
Soon after he found out about peak - oil theory , he collapsed at a local swimming pool .
He collapsed again at his computer .
A terrible , gnawing pain took hold of his gut ; he lost 20 kilograms in three weeks ; his right hand swelled so much that he had to learn to write with his left , one of the few skills he was able to learn after the onset of the illness .
Simon was diagnosed with fibromyalgia , which is thought to be psychogenic , perhaps a demonstration of the mind ’s awesome ability to wreak havoc on the body .
Exercise has put the lost weight back on , but he has a prison pallor and throughout the many hours of our discussion he must stay standing , because of the pain .
Some survivalists carry a ‘ bug - out bag ’ , a pack full of vital goods .
Simon ’s bug - out bag ( contents : 1 x small knife , 2 x fire - starters , 1 x roll of parachute cord ) was a work in progress when he developed fibromyalgia .
He now has a new bug - out bag of sorts , which contains the medicines required if his muscles spasm when he is out of the house .
“ Most people ca n’t prepare , because they do n’t know about peak oil and what it means , ” Simon explains .
“ I know , but I ca n’t prepare . ”
What about telling others ?
“ Most people do n’t want to know , or ca n’t really deal with it .
Besides , if everyone became convinced , the markets would collapse and the process would just happen more quickly . ”
He smiles serenely at this salient point .
Occasionally he will pass on material to a curious friend : “ One guy had just bought a brand new Subaru WRX , and the first CD he listened to [ in it ] was one I gave him , an interview with a peak - oil expert .
Not long after , he bought some acreage in Tasmania .
Tasmania fares well in climate - change models . ”
The only real form of preparation left for Simon is mental preparation .
“ I ’d almost like to become the survivalist version of [ the self - help guru ] Anthony Robbins : someone who can talk to people about these terrible things that will happen , but make them seem positive . ”
He has stripped all the pessimism from his webpage , focusing instead on the rewarding skill set of the hunter - gatherer .
He makes it sound like an endless camping trip .
“ I know I might have romanticised it , ” he admits .
“ But I need to .
It ’s going to happen ; I have to make the change seem positive .
Happiness is all about the perception of growth , of going forward .
So if our current use of resources is imbalanced , then getting that balance back will be an improvement . ”
Would Simon be disappointed if the Event did n’t happen in his lifetime , after all the sacrifices he has made ?
“ That ’s a difficult question .
No civilisation survives forever .
It ’s a question of if , not when .
Things the way they are now , I ’d be happy if society managed five good years .
Ten , at the most .
It ’s difficult for me to imagine 30 years . ”
And if the Event happens now , with him in this state of ill - preparedness ?
“ Oh , I ’ll die of course .
But then , almost everyone will die . ”
For all his careful reflection , there seems to be one factor left out of Simon ’s consideration of post - Event life .
The first generation of the new human race will be drawn exclusively from a gene pool of survivalists .
Well , at least it 's bipartisan .
The still sort - of - new Barack Obama Democratic administration has again adopted another policy straight out of the administration of his much - criticized Republican predecessor , George W. Bush .
Obama administration officials have rejected a watchdog group 's request for a list of healthcare industry executives who 've been meeting secretly in the White House with Obama staffers to discuss healthcare changes being drafted there and in Congress .
According to the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , which is suspicious of the influence of health industry lobbyists and company officers , it received a letter from the Secret Service citing an Obama Justice Department directive and denying access to visitor logs under the " presidential communications privilege . "
Sound familiar ?
Remember the holy hullabaloo in the early Bush years when Vice President Dick Cheney met in the White House compound with energy industry officials and refused to release a list of those executives and the frequency of their visits ?
That controversy was propelled by critical Democrats and was before Obama 's brief Senate tenure .
But wait !
Here are a few promises straight off the Obama Organizing for America website early this morning :
The Problem
Lobbyists Write National Policies :
For example , Vice President Dick Cheney 's Energy Task Force of oil and gas lobbyists met secretly to develop national energy policy .
Secrecy Dominates Government Actions :
The Bush administration has ignored public disclosure rules and has invoked a legal tool known as the " state secrets " privilege more than any other previous administration to get cases thrown out of civil court .
Oh , and this :
Release Presidential Records : Obama and Biden will nullify the Bush attempts to . . .
Earlier today , CNN anchor and Beijing correspondent John Vause was filming in Tiananmen Square , Beijing when he suddenly encountered a man holding an umbrella who wo n’t step away from his cameraman ’s lens .
Maybe it ’s the matching umbrella and pants , but this goes down in our book as the silliest censorship effort ever .
UPDATE : Video footage of the “ umbrella incident ” here :
Embedded video from CNN Video
Also , from CNN Beijing bureau chief Jaime FlorCruz on Twitter :
Just drove around T Square : it ’s swarming with hordes of uniformed and plainclothes cops , some carrying similar umbrellas .
UPDATE 2 : It just gets ridiculouser and ridiculouser !
Now BBC ’s Beijing correspondent James Reynolds has also met with the same treatment .
Whoever thought of this umbrella idea has just made China look oh so good in front of the world ’s media .
UPDATE 3 : Well it looks like AFP got the special umbrella treatment too .

Glenn Beck was in prime form last night .
He warned everyone up front that he was n't arguing that eugenics are about to descend on America .
But then it becomes clear that what he is arguing is that the Democrats and progressives in general and President Obama in general are just like the Nazis .
And in case you did n't get it the first time , he caps the whole thing off by comparing a Nazi cartoon to liberals ' dismissal of the teabaggers .
Of course , he knows he can get away with this kind of nonsense because , hey , if Rush can get away with it , he probably can , too .
And he makes plain that he completely supports Sarah Palin 's intimations of " death panels " and subscribes to her view that universal health care will bring about euthanasia .
In other words , he 's a " deather . "
Oh , and as an added bonanza , he cries .
Again .
He always does this whenever he mentions his disabled daughter .
Which reminds me :
Why do these people who get all indignant when their families get mentioned always hold their families up for public displays of whatever political point they want to make ?
Just wondering .
File this one under " Deluxe Nutball Rant , with Nazis on the side . "
Sumatran tigers are on the brink of extinction
Thieves have killed an endangered Sumatran tiger in an Indonesian zoo and stolen most of its body , officials say .
Only the intestines of the female tiger were left , staff at Taman Rimba Zoo said .
Police believe the thieves intend to sell the animal 's fur and bones .
The World Wildlife Fund estimates that fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers remain in the wild .
Despite laws against the sale of tiger parts , wildlife groups say they are sold openly in several Sumatran towns .
A 2008 study by British - based wildlife trade monitoring network , Traffic , showed that tiger bones , claws , skins and whiskers were being sold openly in eight cities on the island .
Traffic says tigers are killed to supply parts for souvenirs , Chinese medicine and jewellery .
The Sumatran tiger is listed as critically endangered , the highest category of threat .
They are on the brink of extinction because of rapid deforestation , poaching , and conflict with humans .

is the best road trip in America
soaring through nature 's finest show
Denali
the great one
soaring
under the midnight sun
And then the extremes
In the winter time
it 's the frozen road
that is competing with the view
of ice fogged frigid beauty
the cold though
does n't it split
the Cheechakos
from the Sourdoughs ?
And then
in the summertime
such extreme summertime
about a hundred and fifty degrees hotter
than just some months ago
than just some months from now
with fireweed blooming
along the frost heaves
and merciless rivers that are rushing
and carving
and reminding us
that here
Mother Nature wins
It is as throughout
all Alaska
that big wild good life teeming along the road
that is

with strength of character advancing
our beloved state
Sean has that
Craig Campbell has that
I remember
on that December day
we took the oath to uphold
our state constitution and it was written right here
in Fairbanks
by very wise pioneers
We shared the vision
for government
that they ground
in that document
Our founders
wrote all political power
is inherent in the people
All government originates
with the people
It 's founded upon
their will only
and it 's instituted
for the good of the people
as a whole
Their remarkably succinct
words guided us
in all of our efforts
in serving you
and putting you first
and we have done our best
to fulfill promises
that I made on
Alaska Day

when I first asked for
the honor of serving you

do n't get it on this one
Let me tell you
Alaskans really need to stick
together on this
with new leadership
in this area

Among all the reasons geeks choose Linux , security is often near the top of the list .
And no wonder — personal preferences aside on all the other many relevant issues , there ’s plenty of evidence to suggest our favorite operating system really is more impervious .
A study published in The Register a few years back , for example , not only concluded that Linux security then was even better than had been thought compared to Windows security , but also went on to label as “ myths ” and “ logical errors ” many of the most common arguments to the contrary — most notably , the oft - repeated idea that Linux suffers fewer attacks simply because it has fewer users than Windows does .
‘ Not a Kernel Problem ’
Yet when news came out last month that an attack by the “ NULL Pointer ” bug could exploit even a fully patched Linux kernel , a new cloud of dust was kicked up .
Those on both sides of the operating system fence struggled to understand what it meant .
“ The interesting angle here is the actual thing that made it exploitable , the whole class of vulnerabilities , which is a very serious thing , ” Bas Alberts , a senior security researcher at Immunity , told The Register , for example .
On the other hand : “ That does not look like a kernel problem to me at all , ” Linus Torvalds is quoted as saying in an email message .
“ He ’s running a setuid program that allows the user to specify its own modules .
And then you people are surprised he gets local root ? ”
Bloggers on ZDNet , on Cnet , on Digg and others all chimed in with their own opinions , even after the problem was reportedly fixed .
‘ Are We Too Naive ? ’
Perhaps it was in part the fresh controversy that inspired Linux Today ’s Carla Schroder to pen a blog post late last month — entitled , “ Linux doomed to virus plague .
( Again . ) ” — in which she debunks yet again the endlessly recurring warnings that Linux will be subject to increased attacks once it achieves more widespread acceptance .
A talkback thread on Linux Today from around the same time , meanwhile , asked , “ Are we too naive by believing that GNU / Linux is more secure by design ? ”
For Linux Girl , the message was clear :
Time to do a little more investigating .
‘ The Reality Is Much Less Severe ’
“ The headlines for this Linux security hole read like the apocalypse , ” Slashdot blogger yagu told LinuxInsider .
“ The reality is much less severe . ”
First and foremost , “ to fully take advantage of the exploit , a user must have physical access , ” he explained .
“ By definition , physical access is already a compromised system .
Any security issues past that point is simply splitting semantic hairs . ”
Linux is far more secure than Windows , yagu asserted .
“ Linux is Unix — which , by the way , so are Macs , ” he noted .
“ Unix ’s architecture is fundamentally different from Windows , especially the defaults for how access to important system resources is granted .
“ I ’ve worked on Linux , HP Unix , IBM Mainframe Linux , Sun Unix , blah , blah , blah , and in my entire career NEVER seen a compromised system , ” yagu added .
“ At the same time , I ’ve worked with Windows to the extent that I ’ve had to , and I stopped counting the times they ’ve tanked because of attacks . ”
Strength in Diversity ?
Out of the box , “ I believe that Linux is slightly more secure than either Windows or Mac OS X , ” Slashdot blogger drinkypoo told LinuxInsider .
“ Windows Vista — with Service Pack 1 or better — has a superior implementation of ASLR to Linux , which in turn has a superior implementation to that of Mac OS X , though this has allegedly been upgraded in Snow Leopard . ”
On the other hand , Linux is the only desktop operating system with capabilities - oriented security in the form of NSA - developed yet entirely open SElinux , drinkypoo noted .
“ While Unix implementations like Trusted Solaris have provided this functionality for some time , only Linux both has capabilities and is a serious contender for the mass market , including laptops , desktops , palmtops , and basically every other top you can think of .
” Another saving grace for Linux might be the sheer number of distros out there , Monochrome Mentality blogger Kevin Dean suggested .
“ Just as companies like Adobe have problems packaging and maintaining Flash for Linux because of the various formats and standards the filesystem takes , so do would - be malware producers , ” he told LinuxInsider .
“ Getting a script or binary running on a system without leaving some out - of - place traces on any possible distro is hard . ”
‘ The Damage Is Contained ’
Most exploits have also moved “ off of the OS itself and onto the applications and users , ” Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack told LinuxInsider .
“ One advantage for Linux in this case is that most applications run fine as non-root , so the damage is contained .
If someone manages to gain root on Linux , there is no option but to reformat , and now it ’s becoming the same way for Windows . ”
The other advantage Linux has over Windows is that “ most distros have an update system that is easy for third parties to add themselves to , ” he noted .
“ This is something I really wish Microsoft would do for Windows , since that would mean Microsoft apps wo n’t need to either have an administrator running update app or require administrator access to update the software on startup . ”
It ’s also important to note that “ since most malware these days is designed to either spam the net or be used as a DDoS host , the malware does n’t need to actually gain administrator access to cause trouble , ” Mack added .
“ So the main advantage for secure environments is the easier cleanup or the lack of software ability to install a key grabber . ”
‘ Not Just About Popularity ’
For proof that it ’s “ not just about popularity , ” Mack cites the fact “ that Apple has gone from 60 or so known viruses in OS9 to none in OS X , even though their market share has only gone up since then . ”
Linux , in fact , “ went though its ‘ plague ’ five to 10 years ago , where we had a constant stream of tools designed to attack Linux daemons , ” he asserted .
“ That has mostly eliminated itself thanks to most distros dumping software with a history of insecurity and pushing for more non root daemons as well as not running more than what the user needs . ”
Carla Schroder is “ right on in pointing to the widespread use of GNU / Linux on the WWW infrastructure to show how secure GNU / Linux can be , ” blogger Robert Pogson told LinuxInsider .
“ Any OS can be attacked , but with reasonable security precautions , it takes a serious / critical vulnerability to let the attack succeed . ”
‘ Let Them Step Up ’
GNU / Linux has “ its share of vulnerabilities , ” but “ they are much fewer than that other OS because of the openness and modularity of the software , ” Pogson explained .
“ I learned long ago how hard it is to fix spaghetti code .
It is the same thing when your browser plays God in an OS or is allowed to install software or multimedia files that may be executable . ”
GNU / Linux accounts for about 10 percent of PCs , Pogson added .
“ If , at that level , we have never seen a botnet , we will not for a few years more , ” he said .
“ Freedom from malware for a few more years is worth many times the cost of migration to GNU / Linux , ” he asserted .
“ In the meantime , we have time to adopt best practices and to harden GNU / Linux even more than the long - standing Unix permissions and recent improvements .
“ If the anti-malware industry has anything to offer GNU / Linux , ” he added , “ let them step up . ”
‘ The Velma Problem ’
Windows systems are “ exceptionally insecure ” for a number of reasons , agreed Chris Travers , a Slashdot blogger who works on the LedgerSMB project .
“ Most programs are more likely to need administrator access on Windows than on Linux or Mac , and users of Windows are conditioned to downloading and running cute attachments from email , ” Travers explained .
Indeed , Slashdot blogger hairyfeet calls it “ the Velma problem , which I named after a customer who you could actually send an email to that said , ‘ turn off your antivirus and look at these puppy pictures !’ — with a file attached called ‘ happy_puppy.jpg.exe ’ — and she would run it , every single time , ” he recounted .
“ The worst case I had was a guy that would run ANYTHING that had the word ‘ lesbians ’ in it , ” he added .
“ The antivirus could scream , the antispyware would do everything but throw itself in front of the guy trying to stop him , and he would ignore or even turn off all his defenses to run ‘ hot_lesbians.mpg.exe ’ . ”
‘ With a Smile on Her Face ’
The fact that Linux is CLI - heavy has helped it to stay malware - free , hairyfeet told LinuxInsider , “ because you need to have some smarts to run it .
Linux users are also more security conscious and wo n’t just run email attachments or click on spam .
“ But if you ever get rid of CLI , which is what I think will need to happen to get market share , and actually manage to lure the ‘ Velmas ’ and all their friends to Linux ? ” hairyfeet continued .
“ Well then your friends at the Russian Business Network and their friends in China and Nigeria will be writing ‘ Happy_Puppy. jpg.sh ’ and sending it along with nice easy - to - paste instructions that Velma will follow with a smile on her face . ”
Nepomuk has been around for quite a while but the functionality exposed in KDE 4.3 is still not that impressive .
This does not mean that there does not exist cool stuff .
It only means that there is not enough developer power to get it all stable and integrated perfectly .
Let me give you an overview of what already exists in playground and how it can be used ( and how you should use it ) .
The Basics
For starters there is the Nepomuk API in kdelibs which you should get familiar with .
Most importantly ( we will use it quite a lot later on ) there is Nepomuk : : Resource which gives access to arbitrary resources in Nepomuk .
Nepomuk :: Resource file ( myFilePath ) ; file.addTag( Nepomuk :: Tag( “ Fancy stuff ” ) ) ; QString desc = file.description ( ) ; QList < Nepomuk :: Tag > allTags = Nepomuk :: Tag::allTags ( ) ;
Resource allows simple manipulation of data in Nepomuk .
Using some fancy cmake magic through the new NepomukAddOntology Classes macro in kdelibs data manipulation gets even simpler .
The second basic thing you should get familliar with is Soprano and SPARQL .
As a quickstart the following code shows how I typically create queries using Soprano :
using namespace Soprano ; Model * model = Nepomuk :: ResourceManager :: instance ()-> mainModel( ) ; QString query = QString ( “ prefix nao : %1 “ “ select ?x where { “ “ % 2 nao : hasTag ?t . “ “ ? r nao : hasTag ?t . } ” ) .arg( Node::resourceToN3 ( Vocabulary :: NAO::naoNamespace ( ) ) ) .arg( Node::resourceToN3(file.resourceUri( ) ) ) ; QueryResultIterator it = model->executeQuery ( query , Query :: QueryLanguageSparql ) ;
As you can see there is always a lot of QString : : arg involved to prevent hard - coding of URIs ( again Soprano provides some cmake magic for generating Vocabulary namespaces ) .
These are the basics .
Without these basics you cannot use Nepomuk .
Debugging Nepomuk Data
Now before we dive into the unstable , experimental , and really cool stuff let me mention sopranocmd .
sopranocmd is a command line tool that comes with Soprano and allows to perform virtually any operation possible on the Nepomuk RDF database .
It has an exhaustive help output and you should use it to debug your data , test your queries and the like ( if anyone is interested in creating a graphical version , please step up ) .
The Nepomuk database ( hosting only a single Soprano model called “ main ” ) can be accessed though D - Bus as follows :
sopranocmd -- dbus org.kde.NepomukStorage -- model main \ query " select ?r where { ?r ?p ?o . } "
The Good Stuff
There is quite a lot of experimental stuff in the playground but I want to focus on the annotation framework and Scribo .
The central idea of the annotation framework is the annotation suggestion which is encapsulated in the Annotation class ( Hint : run “ make apidox ” in the annotationplugin folder ) .
Instead of the user manually annotating resources ( adding tags or relating things to other things ) the system proposes annotations which the user then simply acknowledges or discards .
These Annotation instances are normally created by AnnotationPlugin instances ( although it is perfectly possible to create them some other way ) which are trigged through an AnnotationRequest .
Before I continue a short piece of code for the impatient :
Resource res = getResource ( ) ; AnnotationPluginWrapper * wrapper = new AnnotationPluginWrapper ( ) ; wrapper.setPlugins ( AnnotationPluginFactory :: instance ( ) ->getPluginsSupportingAnnotationForResource ( res.resourceUri( ) ) ) ; connect ( wrapper , SIGNAL ( newAnnotation ( Nepomuk :: Annotation * ) ) , this , SLOT ( addNewAnnotation ( Nepomuk :: Annotation * ) ) ) ; connect ( wrapper , SIGNAL ( finished ( ) ) , this , SLOT ( slotFinished ( ) ) ) ; AnnotationRequest req ; req.setResource ( res ) ; req.setFilter ( filter ) ; wrapper->getPossibleAnnotations ( req ) ;
The AnnotationPluginWrapper is just a convenience class which prevents us from connecting to each plugin separately .
It reproduces the same signals the plugins emit .
The interesting part is the AnnotationRequest .
At the moment ( the framework is under development .
This also means that your ideas , patches , and even refactoring actions are very welcome ) it has three parameters , all of which are optional :
A resource – The resource for which the annotation should be created .
This parameter is a bit tricky as the Annotation : : create method allows to create an annotation on an arbitrary resource but in some cases it makes perfect sense to only create annotation suggestions for only one resource .
A filter string – A filter is supposed to be a short string entered by the user which triggers an auto - completion via annotations .
Plugins should also take the resource into account if it is set .
A text – An arbitrary long text which is to be analyzed by plugins .
Plugins would typically extract keywords or concepts from it .
Plugins should also take resource and filter into account if possible .
This is where the Scribo system comes in ( more later ) .
Plugins that I already created include very simple ones like the tag plugin which matches the filter to existing tag names and also excludes tags already set on the resource .
Way more interesting are other plugins like the pimotype plugin which matches the filter to pimo types and proposed to use that type or the pimo relation plugin which allows to create relations via a very simple syntax : “ author : trueg “ .
The latter will match author to existing properties and trueg to a value based on the property range .
One step further goes the geonames annotation plugin which matches the filter or the resource label to cities or countries using the geonames web service .
It will then propose to set a location or ( in case the resource label was matched ) to convert the resource into a city or country linking to the geonames resource .
A picture says more than a thousand words .
Thus , here goes :
What do we see here ?
The user entered the text Paris in the AnnotationWidget ( a class available in the framework ) and the framework then created a set of suggested annotations .
The most likely one is Paris , the city in France as sugested by the geonames plugin .
The latter also proposes a few not so likely places .
The pimotype plugin proposes to create a new type named Paris and the tag plugin proposes to create a new tag named Paris .
Here I see room for improvement : if we can relate to the city Paris there is no need for the tag .
Thus , some more sophisticated rating and comparision may be in order .
Now let us bring Scribo into play .
Scribo is another framework in the playground which provides an API for text analysis and keyword extraction .
It is tied into the annotation framework through a dedicated plugin which uses the TextAnnotation class to create annotations on specific text positions .
The TextAnnotation class is supposed to be used to annotate text documents .
It will create a new nfo : TextDocument and make it a nie : isPartOf the main document .
Then the new resource is annotated according to the implementation .
The Scribo framework will extract keywords and entities from the text ( specified via the AnnotationRequest text field ) via plugins which will then be used to create annotation suggestions .
There currently exist three plugins for Scribo : the datetime plugin extracts dates and times , the pimo plugin matches words in the text to things in the Nepomuk database , and the OpenCalais plugin will use the OpenCalais webservice to extract entities from the text .
You can try the Scribo framework by using the scriboshell which can be found in the playground , too :
Paste the text to analyze in the left view and press the “ Start ” button .
The right panel will then show all found entities and keywords including the text position and relevance .
The other possibility is to directly use the resourceeditor which is part of the annotation framework and bundles all gui elements the latter has to offer in one widget .
Call it on a text file and you will get a window similar to the following :
At the top you have the typical things : editable label and description , the rating , and the tags .
Below that you have the exisiting properties and annotations .
In the picture these are only properties extracted by Strigi .
Then comes the interesting part : the suggestions .
Here you can see three different Scribo plugins in action .
First the pimo plugin matched the word “ Brein ” to an event I already had in my Nepomuk database .
Then there is the OpenCalais plugin which extracted the “ Commission of European Communities ” ( so far the plugin ignores the additional semantic information provided by OpenCalais ) and proposes to tag the text with it .
The last suggested annotation that we can see is “ Create Event “ .
This is a very interesting hack I did .
The Scribo plugin detected the mentioning of a project , a date , and persons and thus , proposes to create an event which has as its topic the project and takes place at the extracted time .
Since it is a hack created specifically for a demo its results will not be very great in many situations .
But it shows the direction which I would like to take .
Below the suggestions you can see the AnnotationWidget again which allows to manually annotate the file .
How to Write an AnnotationPlugin
This is a Howto in three sentences : Derive from AnnotationPlugin and implement doGetPossibleAnnotations .
In that method trigger the creation of annotations .
Your annotations can be instances of SimpleAnnotation or be based on Annotation and implement at least doCreate , exists , and equals .
class MyAnnotationPlugin : pubic Nepomuk :: AnnotationPlugin { public : MyAnnotationPlugin( QObject * parent , const QVariantList& ) ; protected : void doGetPossibleAnnotations ( const Nepomuk:: AnnotationRequest& ) ; } ; void MyAnnotationPlugin::doGetPossibleAnnotations ( const Nepomuk :: AnnotationRequest& request ) { // MyFancyAnnotation can do all sorts of crazy things like creating // whole graphs of data or even openeing another GUI addNewAnnotation ( new MyFancyAnnotation ( request ) ) ; // SimpleAnnotation can be used to create simple key / value pairs Nepomuk : : Types :: Property property ( Soprano :: Vocabulary :: NAO:: prefLabel ( ) ) ; Nepomuk : : SimpleAnnotation * anno = new Nepomuk : : SimpleAnnotation ( ) ; anno->setProperty ( property ) ; anno->setValue( " Hello World " ) ; // currently only the comment is used in the existing GUIs anno->setComment ( " Set label to ' Hello World ' " ) ; addNewAnnotation ( anno ) ; // tell the framework that we are done .
All this could also // be async emitFinsihed ( ) ; }
And Now ?
At the Nepomuk workshop Tom Albers already experimented with integrating the annotation suggestions into Mailody .
It is rather simple to do that but the framework still needs polishing .
More importantly , however , the created data needs to be presented to the user in a more appealing way .
In short : I need help with all this !
Integrate it into your applications , improve it , come up with new ways of presenting the information , write new plugins .
Jump on board of the semantic desktop train .
Thanks for reading .
First in Europe and now in the United States , Muslim groups have petitioned to establish enclaves in which they can uphold and enforce greater compliance to Islamic law .
While the U.S. Constitution enshrines the right to religious freedom and the prohibition against a state religion , when it comes to the rights of religious enclaves to impose communal rules , the dividing line is more nebulous .
Can U.S. enclaves , homeowner associations , and other groups enforce Islamic law ?
Such questions are no longer theoretical .
While Muslim organizations first established enclaves in Europe , [ 1 ] the trend is now crossing the Atlantic .
Some Islamist community leaders in the United States are challenging the principles of assimilation and equality once central to the civil rights movement , seeking instead to live according to a separate but equal philosophy .
The Gwynnoaks Muslim Residential Development group , for example , has established an informal enclave in Baltimore because , according to John Yahya Cason , director of the Islamic Education and Community Development Initiative , a Baltimore - based Muslim advocacy group , " there was no community in the U.S. that showed the totality of the essential components of Muslim social , economic , and political structure . " [ 2 ]
Baltimore is not alone .
In August 2004 , a local planning commission in Little Rock , Arkansas , granted The Islamic Center for Human Excellence authorization to build an internal Islamic enclave to include a mosque , a school , and twenty - two homes . [ 3 ]
While the imam , Aquil Hamidullah , says his goal is to create " a clean community , free of alcohol , drugs , and free of gangs , " [ 4 ] the implications for U.S. jurisprudence of this and other internal enclaves are greater : while the Little Rock enclave might prevent the sale of alcohol , can it punish possession and in what manner ?
Can it force all women , be they residents or visitors , to don Islamic hijab ( headscarf ) ?
Such enclaves raise the fundamental questions of when , how , and to what extent religious practice may supersede the U.S. Constitution .
The Internal Muslim Enclave
The internal Muslim enclave proposed by the Islamic Center for Human Excellence in Arkansas represents a new direction for Islam in the United States .
The group seeks to transform a loosely organized Muslim population into a tangible community presence .
The group has foreign financial support : it falls under the umbrella of a much larger Islamic group , " Islam 4 the World , " an organization sponsored by Sharjah , one of the constituent emirates of the United Arab Emirates .
[ 5 ]
While the Islamic Center for Human Excellence has yet to articulate detailed plans for its Little Rock enclave , the group 's reliance on foreign funding is troublesome .
Past investments by the United Arab Emirates ' rulers and institutions have promoted radical interpretations of Islam . [ 6 ]
The Islamic Center for Human Excellence may seek to segregate schools and offices by gender .
The enclave might also exercise broad control upon commerce within its boundaries — provided the economic restrictions did not discriminate against out - of - state interests or create an undue burden upon interstate commerce .
But most critically , the enclave could promulgate every internal law — from enforcing strict religious dress codes to banning alcohol possession and music ; it could even enforce limits upon religious and political tolerance .
Although such concepts are antithetical to a free society , U.S. democracy allows the internal enclave to function beyond the established boundaries of our constitutional framework .
At the very least , the permissible parameters of an Islamist enclave are ill defined .
The greater American Muslim community 's unapologetic and public manifestation of belief in a separate but equal ideology does not bode well .
In September 2004 , the New Jersey branch of the Islamic Circle of North America rented Six Flags Adventure Park in New Jersey for " The Great Muslim Adventure Day . "
The advertisement announcing the event stated : " The entire park for Muslims only . "
While legal — and perhaps analogous to corporate or other non-religious groups renting facilities , the advertisement expressly implied a mindset that a proof of faith was required for admission to the park .
In his weblog , commentator Daniel Pipes raises a relevant and troubling question about the event : because it is designated for Muslims only , " Need one recite the shahada to enter the fairgrounds ? " [ 7 ]
While U.S. law might give such Muslims - only events the benefit of the doubt , flexibility may not go both ways .
There is precedent of Islamists taking advantage of liberal flexibility to more extreme ends .
Canada provides a useful example into how Islamist groups can exploit liberal legal tolerance .
In 1991 , Ontario , Canada , passed a seemingly innocuous law called the " Arbitration Act . " [ 8 ]
This act permitted commercial , religious , or such other designated arbitrators to settle civil disputes outside the Canadian justice system so long as the result did not contradict Canadian law .
Like U.S. authorities are beginning to do now , Canadian legislators decided to give religious groups the benefit of the doubt , assuming that they would still hold national law to be paramount .
In October 2003 , under the auspices of the Ontario legislation , the Islamic Institute of Civil Justice created Muslim arbitration boards and stated its intent to arbitrate on the basis of Islamic law . [ 9 ]
A national furor erupted , particularly among Canadian Muslim women 's groups that opposed the application of traditional Islamic ( Shari‘a ) laws that would supersede their far more liberal and egalitarian democratic rights .
After nearly two years of legal wrangling , the premier of Ontario , Dalton McGuinty , held that religious - based arbitrations " threaten our common ground , " and announced , " There will be no Shari ‘a law in Ontario .
There will be no religious arbitration in Ontario .
There will be one law for all Ontarians . " [ 10 ]
On November 15 , 2005 , McGuinty 's provincial government submitted legislation to amend the arbitration act to abrogate , in effect , all religious arbitration . [ 11 ]
Requests for Muslim enclaves within larger U.S. communities may signal that U.S. jurisprudence will soon be faced with a similar conundrum .
Islamist exceptionalism can abuse the tolerance liberal societies have traditionally extended to interface between religious and secular law .
Prior to the Islamic Institute of Civil Justice demands to impose Shari‘a , the Arbitration Act worked well .
Unfortunately for Canadian Jews , the repeal ended state - enforcement of agreements reached by the use of a millennia - old rabbinical court system called beit din ( house of law ) that had for decades quietly settled marriage , custody , and business disputes .
Joel Richler , Ontario region chairman of the Canadian Jewish Congress , expressed his lament : " If there have been any problems flowing from any rabbinical court decisions , I 'm not aware of them . " [ 12 ] Canadian Catholics likewise were stopped from being able to annul marriages according to Canon Law and avoid undue entanglement in civil courts .
Abuse of the spirit of the law , though , ended up curtailing local liberty .
Rather than soften the edge between religion and state , the Islamic Institute of Civil Justice threatened to eliminate it with the imposition of Shari‘a .
The Canadian experience demonstrates how flexibility can backfire when all parties do not seek to uphold basic precepts of tolerance .
The Little Rock application raises the specter of a parallel situation .
While The Islamic Center for Human Excellence may state it wants to create a clean - living community , might the community 's extreme interpretation of Shari ‘a force a reconsideration of just how much leeway the U.S. government gives religious communities ?
As the Muslim community in the United States grows , an increasingly active Islamist lobby has submitted numerous white papers and amicus briefs to legislators and courts arguing for the religious right of Muslims to apply Shari‘a law , particularly in relation to family law disputes . [ 13 ]
This looming jurisprudential conflict is significant for it raises issues about the rights of community members to marry outside the community , forced marriages , and the minimum age of brides , and whether wives and daughters may enjoy equal inheritance .
In cases of non-family law , it raises the question about whether the testimony of women will be considered on par with that of men .
No previous enclave in U.S. history has ever been so vigorously protected by agents of group identity politics or so adamantly defended by legal watchdogs ; nor has any previous religious enclave possessed the potency of more than one billion believers around the world .
Islamic - only communities may also benefit from the largess provided by billions of petrol dollars to finance growth .
The track record of Saudi and other wealthy Persian Gulf donations and charitable efforts are worrisome .
There is a direct correlation between Saudi money received and the spread of intolerant practices .
In 2004 , for example , the U.S. Treasury Department froze the assets of Al - Haramein Foundation , one of Saudi Arabia 's largest nongovernmental organizations , because of its financial links to Al - Qaeda . [ 14 ]
Additionally , American graduates of Saudi academies advance Wahhabist interpretations of Islam inside the U.S. prison system , [ 15 ] and Saudi - subsidized publications promote intolerance inside U.S. mosques . [ 16 ]
A Muslim enclave is uniquely perilous because there are few if any internal enclaves that adhere to a polity dedicated to the active abrogation of secular law and the imposition of a supreme religious law .
The concept of Shari‘a is so fundamental to Islam , that even today , prominent Muslim jurists argue over whether a Muslim can fully discharge Shari ‘a obligations while residing in a non-Muslim territory . [ 17 ]
Yet , in spite of this apparent conundrum , Muslims have resided peacefully in non-Muslim lands since the seventh century .
In the greater context , there may be a breach in the dike for Islamist groups residing in the United States because the Baltimore and Little Rock enclaves must acknowledge the U.S. Constitution as the paramount basis of civil law .
A dissident Islamic sub-community is filled with dichotomous propositions : from the presumed supremacy of Shari ‘a - based law over secular law ; the melding of religion and polity versus the constitutionally mandated separation of same ; to the politics of group and factionalism , versus assimilation and pluralism .
To deny the settlement of a Muslim - only community based solely upon prejudices formed after September 11 would be illiberal .
But the alternative , opening the door to Islamic enclaves without scrutiny , is as dubious .
The Enclave under U.S. Law
Existing U.S. legal precedent , though , may provide some grounds for handling expansive demands for Islamic enclaves .
U.S. legal views of internal enclaves derive from the famous 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision , in which the Supreme Court ruled the concept of separate but equal to be unconstitutional . [ 18 ]
While the case revolved around the right of black children to attend white schools , it promulgated a concept that is anathema in today 's world of multiculturalism : neither the state nor any constituent group could claim equality through separation .
Enclaves can exist , though .
As courts have ruled on issues relating to equality under the law and upon the autonomy of religious practice , two distinctive features of internal U.S. enclaves have taken shape : first , the boundaries of the enclave should be recognized by local inhabitants .
Second , the enclave cannot supersede the constitutionally protected rights of the citizens of a state .
Because most rights secured by the constitution are protected only against infringement by government action , the Supreme Court has avoided establishing a bright - line test as to the limits of religious liberty .
Any religious group or individual seeking to establish an internal enclave has the right to limit residency , promulgate local rules , and perhaps even collect fees or taxes to support nominal community services .
Such enclaves do not hold final sway over the rights of non-residents , however .
In Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Company [ 19 ] and Flagg Brothers v. Brooks , [ 20 ] the court outlined constitutional protections for private citizens in which any entity , religious or otherwise , exercising governmental authority over private citizens remains subject to the provisions of the First and Fourteenth amendments .
In both cases , the court affirmed that citizens of a state retain their right to " due process of law " under the Fourteenth Amendment , even when inside an enclave .
These holdings , however , do not prevent enclaves from restricting the individual freedoms of their inhabitants .
The Supreme Court has ruled upon the limits of religious liberty .
In Cantwell v. Connecticut , the court outlined the circumstances in which the government could act to restrict religious independence .
The court held that the free exercise clause " embraces two concepts — freedom to believe and freedom to act .
The first is absolute , but in the nature of things , the second can not be .
Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society . " [ 21 ]
Christopher L. Eisgruber , professor of law at New York University , explained .
He argued that , " the Constitution permits government to nurture ideological sub- communities founded upon premises inconsistent with the constitution 's own commitments . " [ 22 ]
He maintained that such dissident sub-communities can provide important " sources of dissent " [ 23 ] and asserted that even if an enclave embraced ideals contrary to constitutional ideals , it should still be granted the right to pursue its own vision of good .
For example , he wrote :
[ Though ] it is regrettable that young women in Kiryas Joel [ a Satmar Hasidic enclave ] will grow up in a starkly sexist culture , and it is regrettable that the Amish children of Yoder will find it very hard to become astronomers or lawyers … it would also be regrettable if the United States were not home to any sub-communities which , like the Satmars or the Amish , rejected principles of justice fundamental to the American regime . [ 24 ]
According to Eisgruber , tolerance of the intolerant is fundamental to the freedoms espoused by Western liberal democracy .
While Islamists might use such logic to argue for the permissibility of Shari ‘a communities , such tolerance has limits .
Enclaves do not have carte blanche to act .
Both the state and national legislatures must retain control over the extent of accommodation , and there should be no subsidization of the enclave by the government . [ 25 ]
Such limits ensure that the government can constrain those sub-communities that might espouse more radical , violent , or racist views . [ 26 ]
It is usually when the U.S. government moves to uphold the rule of law that most Americans first learn of an internal enclave .
Few Americans knew of the philosophy espoused by anti-government activist Randy Weaver until 1992 when the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms raided his compound at Ruby Ridge , Idaho , killing Vicki Weaver , their infant son , Sam , and the family dog . [ 27 ]
Nor did many Americans know about David Koresh and his religious views until a raid the following year on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco , Texas , in which a resulting fire killed fifty adults and twenty - five children under the age of fifteen . [ 28 ]
While tragic , such events involved cults or political splinter groups .
The growth of Muslim enclaves raises the specter of such conflicts occurring on a much larger scale .
While the court has interpreted the establishment clause to empower the government to constrain dissident sub-communities when necessary to protect public safety , it has been wary of addressing legal issues requiring intrusion upon the religious polity .
Because the First Amendment provides for religious freedom , the court has confined itself to ruling upon three basic issues : property disputes between national religious hierarchical organizations with affiliated breakaway entities ; accommodations under the free exercise clause ; and the prohibition against the establishment of a state religion .
New challenges , though , may lead to new interpretations .
The Antithesis to Democracy
Is concern over internal Muslim enclaves justified ?
On their face , the fundamental principles of the internal Muslim enclave are no more invidious than any other religious enclave .
But ideology matters .
Many proponents of an Islamic polity promote an ideology at odds with U.S. constitutional jurisprudence and the prohibition against the establishment of a state - sponsored religion .
The refusal to recognize federal law makes Islamist enclaves more akin to Ruby Ridge than to the Hasidic and Amish cases cited by Eisgruber .
Muslim theologians describe Islam not only as a religion but also as a system of state .
The Qur'an — viewed by Muslims as the word of God — is replete with instructions about governance .
An enclave promoting Islamic mores does not necessarily restrict itself to a social atmosphere but also one of governance .
Traditional Islamic law controls the most basic aspects of everyday life and may make any Islamic enclave irreconcilable with the basic presumptions of Western liberal democracy and secular law .
While many American Muslims practice Islam and embrace the fundamental principles of the U.S. Constitution , others do not .
There are consistent attempts by Islamist elements overseas to strengthen their own radical interpretation of Islam at the expense of moderation and tolerance .
Saudi donors , for example , have propagated the ideology of Islamism , which seeks to interweave a narrow and often intolerant interpretation of religion into an all - encompassing political ideology .
The number of imams and jihadists who have been outspoken in identifying the supremacy of Shari‘a to democracy underlines the incompatibility of Islamism and democracy .
The late Saudi theologian , Sheikh Muhammad bin Ibrahim al - Jubair , for example , stated ,
Only one ambition is worthy of Islam , to save the world from the curse of democracy : to teach men that they cannot rule themselves on the basis of man-made laws .
Mankind has strayed from the path of God , we must return to that path or face certain annihilation . [ 29 ]
Prior to Iraq 's January 30 , 2005 elections , Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , leader of Al - Qaeda in Iraq , released an audiotape in which he declared war upon democracy and denounced its tenets as " the very essence of heresy , polytheism , and error . " [ 30 ]
Nor is Islamist antipathy for democracy limited to popular elections .
According to a Saudi publication distributed at a San Diego mosque , " [ Democracy is ] responsible for all the horrible wars … more than 130 wars with more than 120 million people dead [ in the twentieth century alone ] ; not counting victims of poverty , hunger and disease . " [ 31 ]
Such sentiments reflect a common theme among Islamists : democracy is the antithesis to everything pious and pure in Islam ; and , in truth , democracy is the direct and substantial causal effect of Muslim suffering and injustice in the world today .
This does not mean that Islamists are unwilling to use democracy for their ends .
But while they accept the trappings of democracy , they continue to reject its principles because the Shari‘a , to them the perfect rule of law , cannot be abrogated or altered by the shifting moods of a secular electorate .
Mohamed Elhachmi Hamdi , editor - in - chief of the pan-Arab weekly Al - Mustakillah , explained ,
The heart of the matter is that no Islamic state can be legitimate in the eyes of its subjects without obeying the main teachings of the Shari‘a .
A secular government might coerce obedience , but Muslims will not abandon their belief that state affairs should be supervised by the just teachings of the holy law . [ 32 ]
He could draw from plenty of examples .
In 1992 , for example , Ali Balhadj , a leader of the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria , declared , " When we are in power , there will be no more elections because God will be ruling . " [ 33 ]
While mayor of Istanbul , Islamist Turkish politician Recep Tayyip Erdoğan quipped , " For us , democracy is a streetcar .
We would go as far as we could , and then get off . " [ 34 ]
As he eviscerates the judiciary , many Turks wonder about his sincerity . [ 35 ]
Experience abroad is relevant , as it goes to the heart of the sincerity of proponents of the Little Rock and Baltimore enclaves , an issue compounded by the willingness to accept donations from Persian Gulf financiers .
Conclusion
How Muslims reconcile Islamic polity within the confines of Western liberal democracy is an unresolved issue .
This process will take years to evolve and is likely to convulse in further violent episodes .
Presently , many Muslims reject wholesale the notion of a dominant secular law and instead seek the imposition of a pan-Islamist state under the guidance of Shari‘a .
These Islamists view secular modernity and the democratic practices of radical egalitarianism , individual rights , and free exercise of religion as a direct and substantial threat to their belief system , and they are intent on employing violence against the West for the foreseeable future .
The remainder and majority of the Muslim world must reject nihilism and engage in widespread debate regarding Islam 's role within the world community .
The local planning commission in Little Rock , Arkansas , might proceed with the proposed Muslim enclave , but the Arkansas courts and its legislature should not abdicate its responsibilities to ensure that Western liberal rights and protections remain supreme .
The government should monitor both the rhetoric and behavior of these communities .
As the Supreme Court stated in Cantwell : the freedom to believe is absolute , but the freedom to act , in the nature of things , cannot be , especially as to the safety and preservation of the American democracy . [ 36 ]
