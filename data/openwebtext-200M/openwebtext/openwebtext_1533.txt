February 21 , 2008 - Willie Nelson busts out 47 seconds of 9/11 skepticism after a question from Juan Gonzalez .
Google has never been too inclined to give the world the straight dope on total app counts in the Android Market , but other companies -- notably AndroLib -- have been happy to try to pick up the slack .
The app tracking site now reports a grand total of 50,031 approved binaries as of this writing , marking a pretty magical milestone in light of the Market 's humble beginnings as a free - only cache of a handful of apps for the G1 .
To be fair , AndroLib is aggregating across all of the Market 's regional sites -- you wo n't find 50,000 apps in any one Market alone -- but it 's undoubtedly a solid sign for the platform .
Now we just need a little Froyo to go with that , right ?
Steve Jobs is on an e-mail tear lately .
In what may be his longest email response to date , Jobs addressed the future of Final Cut Pro .
None too pleased with the most recent Final Cut Pro update , a Mac Soda reader emailed Jobs to get some clarification regarding Apple ’s continued interest in the software .
Steve , Getting worried about Apple ’s interest in Final Cut .
Last updates were not stellar .
I heard a bunch of engineers were dropped too – give us a sign you still care about Pro Video , not just the iPad .
Thanks ,
Alex
Steve Jobs responded :
We certainly do .
Folks who left were in support , not engineering .
Next release will be awesome .

Third - party collections is arguably the only growth industry left in the states besides those folks who wave signs advertising local businesses at intersections , millions of Americans find their lives disrupted by them .
Calls as early as 8 a.m. , or as late as 8 p.m .
Multiple times a day , these menaces phone , leaving cryptic messages , threatening legal action , and spouting quasi - lawyer palaver in an attempt to shake down the poor and the clueless , the destitute and dispossessed , the victims of fraud and their own gullibility .
That ’s the process by which an operator buys some old paper from a lender or a record club or some such and attempts to collect on these debts from two or three years ago .
It ’s a low - risk proposition .
The “ debts cost seven or eight dollars a piece , ” according to one industry lifer .
And — on paper , at least — the debts are worth many times that number , ranging from $ 67 to upwards of $ 2,000 — even before the various refinancing charges and account adjustments are factored in .
Of late , there has been much journalism about the third - party collections racket — and it is a racket , predicated on shakedowns and threats of imminent legal action .
That said , most of the writing is non-specific about how the industry actually works , in part because the collections industry , like any other hustle , operates under a system of kayfabe .
Its secrets are protected .
Only on the inside can one truly discover how the scams are worked , and how employees are made to believe that their spurious and extralegal efforts are somehow virtuous , driven by the superficial morality that these people are morally liable for failing to pay off their payday loans from late 2007 .
I know this because , at least for a short time , I was on the inside of one of these scams .
I read the script .
I played the role .
I helped to work the marks .
And for that , I suppose I should be sorry .
My foray into the sordid world of third - party collections happened , ironically enough , as the result of my own personal liquidity crisis .
One of my principal clients suddenly decided that paying freelancers was not a primary concern .
I needed cash flow , and I was n’t convinced I could write my way out of this problem .
So I decided to explore an industry about which I had always wondered , but had never quite had the impetus to enter .
I went to Craigslist and searched for “ collections ” on the job board .
I wanted something with quick cash and weekly paydays , something I could start immediately .
I was willing to scrape the bottom of the barrel , to shave facts off my application to ensure I was n’t “ overqualified , ” and thus , unhireable .
The ad read :
“ Must call 904 737-1250 for an interview .
Absolutely NO EMAILS
We are looking for strong personalities that are not afraid of talking to people .
Must have a good work ethic and good people skills .
Will Train if you prove to be the right type person .
Previous collections experience not necessary .
This is a long - term position .
Looking for individuals not afraid of the phone and who want to make $ $ $ .
CALL S & W Specialty Group , LLC located in Jacksonville , FL 904 737-6942 and ask for Mr. Thomas to set up appointment No emails please . ”
Seemed easy enough .
The syntactical errors in the ad suggested that it was written by a self - educated man , one who , deep down , believed he was smarter than all the marks he worked .
And , just maybe , inside I wondered if it was true .
Could I , a struggling journalist , make $ $ $ or even $ $ ?
I , after all , was a “ strong personality . ”
I called “ Mr. Thomas , ” as the ad suggested , and was summoned to the office for an interview .
The office park housing this agency was , like most in Jacksonville , on the formerly chic “ southside ” of town in an unremarkable strip mall .
When I walked in , I was handed a short application and a math test .
Both were completed in about 10 minutes .
Mr. Thomas — a.k.a.
Thomas Stidham , the S behind “ S & W ” — is an older man in his early 60s , with white hair , half - glasses , and a singsong twang oddly reminiscent of Mr. Haney from “ Green Acres . ”
He has run many corporations in several different locales — things like “ Thomas Stidham Enterprises ”
He , along with portly “ Pat , ” a menopausal matron with a heartbroken twang in her voice , ran the shop .
Their twained office desks faced the back of a row of Dilbert - styled cubicles with sad , fake stained - wood desks .
All day , every day , they stared at the backs of their employees ’ heads .
This is standard for the industry .
The conversation was brief and agreeable .
All parties concurred that I “ had what it takes . ”
But , fretted Pat , who looked resplendent in a Dollar General blouse with a Jello - mold print , “ he wo n’t stay . ”
I rebutted quickly .
“ I would stay .
Absolutely .
I ’m just looking for work . ” I stared downwards .
“ My girl ’s got a baby on the way . ”
Tom bought in .
“ You ’re just lookin ’ for work , huh ? ”
Yes sir .
I responded .
But I was looking for more than that .
I sought answers about practices within this industry .
The kind of answers that could only be obtained by going inside its bowels , by doing the dirty work that collectors do , work that everyone — from the scammed and legitimate debtors to the myriad contacts , “ primary references , ” “ 3rd degree relatives , ” “ associates , ” former roommates , landlords , and past and present employers and housemates — despises .
Like working in a slaughterhouse , it is the type of job — and mindset — one can only fully understand from inside the belly of the beast .
I did n’t hide the fact that I was a writer ; unlike Barbara Ehrenreich in “ Nickel and Dimed , ” who felt compelled to obscure her identity , my anonymity and lack of real career achievement was , for once , a protection .
Tom even felt compelled to patronize me .
Draping a flabby arm over my shoulder , he told me to “ be creative … do n’t be afraid to talk to people like you ’ve always wanted to talk to them , ” and to enjoy a measure of “ literary license ” ( something not afforded to me on most of the writing jobs I ’ve held , for what it ’s worth . )
I showed up at 11 a.m. on a dreary mid-January Thursday for training .
I was assigned to shadow a “ Ms. Tan , ” a single mother who was seven months pregnant with another baby daddy ’s legacy — but no worries there , she assured me within an hour of making my acquaintance that “ he made good money ” and “ really wanted a kid ” and so there would be money on her child support card .
When I heard that , my stomach flipped .
This was n’t the way women of my acquaintance talked , making the overt case that the child they carry is some sort of 18 - year promissory note .
But those women had all been to good schools and learned early on to like the right brands and to aspire to the upper - middle - class hipster aesthetic , even if they could n’t quite afford it without parental help .
They had learned to fake it , but Ms. Tan , a square - jawed , bottle - blond Arlington native , did not .
Ms . Tan gave it to me straight .
“ Your name is Anthony , huh ?
Have n’t had good luck with Anthonys , or Tonys , ” she muttered before going on to complain about the disproportionate number of Latinos she had to call doing “ investigations into possible fraud on a bank account formerly held ” for the “ finalization ” department at this “ pre-litigation ” firm , as the script put it .
“ This is Ms. Tan working in coordination with [ Insert County Name Here ] investigating a possible case of identity fraud .
I need you to verify the last four digits of your social security number …. ”
Over and over again , I listened to the script , and the other statements that were unscripted but still as rote : like the empty threat that , if “ restitution ” was n’t made by the end of the day , then the “ network of attorneys ” our firm “ represented ” would insist that “ paperwork would be sent to the county courthouse . ”
There were no attorneys , of course .
Just as there was no company Web site , or even an e-mail address beyond one at earthlink .
net .
In other words : a total scam .
S&W was little more than a shell company created to buy bad debts and attempt to enforce them via naked threats and pidgin legalese .
I learned how to play the role , to sound like law enforcement without actually representing myself as a LEO .
When my technique was on and the person on the other end was particularly credulous , I would be referred to , I was assured , as an “ investigator ” or a “ detective . ”
That claim came to pass .
As watchdog Web site 800 Notes.com claims , in a story about the uptick of complaints against collection agencies : “ More Debt Collectors Use Abusive , Illegal Tactics .
Debt collectors are leaning hard on consumers to make good on their debts , and , in the process , some are crossing the line .
They call friends , family members and co-workers trying to embarrass the debtor into paying .
The worst threaten violence , spew obscenities and claim — falsely — that “ unless a payment is made immediately the debtor will be hauled off to jail . ”
We never threatened violence at S&W — I ’ll say that much .
But we were willing and able to use the Lexis - Nexis skiptracing program , Accurint , to find our debtors , and a healthy cross-section of their associates .
Except for the kind of people who lived on other people ’s couches , using disposable cell - phones , and the ones who did n’t speak English , we were able to find the majority of our debtors through pressuring their lily - livered or ill - wishing associates into giving up the info .
And we were n’t the only ones .
Florida ’s Office of Financial Regulation , which licenses collectors , received 780 complaints in 2009 , compared with 629 in 2008 .
This year there will be more .
Third - party collections is not a business in which one goes to make friends .
One enters it to professionally tear people down , making chicken feed while the operator gets rich .
Perhaps that ’s why it ’s an easy field in which one can get credentialed .
After a few hours of training , I was ready to be put on the phones .
I was given a “ portfolio ” of debt to manage — 100 accounts , totaling about $ 60,000 of paper value ( though only about $ 800 in negotiated cost to the company . )
Making $ 8 an hour , with an unreachable commission goal of $ 1,500 “ green ” in a week , it was easy to see my utility here .
If I suckered one $ 800 debtor into paying up , I had just offset the cost of my entire portfolio .
Even if I brought in 10 percent of my debts in a few weeks , I would not only pay for my portfolio and salary , but a great deal of the costs of the operation .
Stidham ensured the short - term liquidity of the operation going in , setting aside $ 40,000 for payroll , to be dispersed “ whether we made money or not , ” according to Tan .
An easy enough move to make , given that the worst - case scenario was that he would just bundle together the uncollectible debts and sell them downstream , to God knows who .
This practice would be the fate of all debts at least until they reached their seven - year statute of limitations .
Part of my employment of the aforementioned “ literary license ” was that I was given the opportunity to rename myself .
Tom decided I should go by “ Mr. Steele . ”
I developed a voice worthy of the gimmick — a southern accent , modeled after the PE coach in “ Beavis and Butthead . ”
The intent was to sound like a grizzled , hand - em - their - asses investigator , who has dispatched the hardest cases in the entire world of pre-litigation .
And to be sure , there were cases .
There was the man whose uncle told me that he had actually fallen for two separate Nigerian e-mail scams .
There were pregnant teens who I called ; they cried as they were told of the pending “ identity theft , theft of services , or check fraud ” charges against them .
There were men who changed names and towns every few years ; people whose phone numbers changed faster than billboards ; single mothers living in halfway houses , on relatives ’ couches , and so on .
There was the man in Pennsylvania — the son of a college professor , who brought his family into disgrace by stealing from the college for which his dad worked ( according to the man ’s ex-mother - in - law , who went on at some length about what a “ drug addict ” the debtor was ) .
The man in Alabama — barely 21 , whose girlfriend was dumping him in the background as I rattled off my list of quasi- charges against him .
And the Texas woman whose stepmother , an 81 - year - old fan of “ The Price Is Right ” — if the background noise meant anything — spent about 45 minutes shoveling dirt on her stepdaughter .
She talked of never seeing the woman and her common - law husband , who was being investigated by Child Services in Texas for molesting the debtor ’s daughter ( who was in foster care at the time as a result ) .
The stepmother assured me that I could find the woman at the husband ’s mother ’s house , where they were taking care of the sickly woman .
“ They ’re just waiting for her to die .
They ’re buzzards .
They want the money . ”
And so did I .
I called the debtor at her current residence and , after a brief and fairly pleasant chat , the husband yanked the phone away from her .
“ How dare you call this number ?
My mother just had open heart surgery . ”
He was livid and his voice so loud that there was distortion even on the landline .
Usually I refrained from using personal information given to me by an informant against someone on the other end of the line .
But in this case I could n’t resist .
“ Hopefully you ’re taking care of your mother better than you did your stepdaughter . ”
Then I hung up .
Was it harassment ?
Obviously .
Unethical ?
Indubitably .
But all of us had our reasons .
We were a special breed ; we had to be — to convince these suckers that six shades of hell would descend upon them if they did n’t pay some $ 200 debt from December 2007 .
But there were two parties there who stood out , even among the rest of us .
There was the couple from Lake City — Scott and Shana Falanie — who were the most rah-rah of all the collectors there .
The husband would occasionally shout industry - approved slogans like “ Green is the Scene ” ( a reference to the desirability of “ green ” money , which came in that same day , as opposed to money of other color designations , which came in days , weeks , or months down the road ) .
The Falanies had a side business : they pushed a health drink called Monavie , which they would often try to impose on their office mates , offering the first one for free as if it were cocaine .
On general principle , and a categorical aversion to them , I refused to buy any of this potion .
And at three dollars a bottle , it was out of my price range .
And then there was John , the shadiest operator in the bunch .
His wardrobe consisted of a lot of faded polo shirts and sweaters , and his stories never quite added up .
His principal occupation , outside of the office , was taking care of his ancient grandmother , whose age shifted from one day to the next .
One day she was 96 , the next 93 , then 95 the following day — sort of like a summer weather forecast with minor thermometer variations .
John claimed to own a BMW , but could n’t drive it .
His license had been suspended , and so he was relegated to driving Grandma ’s Cavalier to and from work .
Despite this , he lived the high life according to his tales .
He was at the bar every night , and frequented Outback Steakhouse and the like with regularity .
And he boasted about taking a spur of the moment trip to Miami to see the Pro Bowl — only to find himself thwarted when the fascists at the ticket counter would n’t accept a photocopy of his driver ’s license as identification .
And then there was the time he brought Hershey ’s Kisses and ChapStick into the office for “ the ladies ” for Valentine ’s Day .
The general consensus was that his lines were all bullshit , but at least he was entertaining .
Ms. Tan “ loved him to death . ”
A job like this could n’t go on forever , at least not for me .
I started to come home at the end of every shift with migraines .
I began to skip work or come in late .
And the writing was on the wall ; if those chairs were n’t filled , money was n’t being made for “ The Group . ”
Despite the amiable dunce act I put on to get this job , I also noticed that my relationship with Mr. Thomas was starting to sour .
When I talked to him one morning and dropped phrases like “ debts being resold downstream ” and referred to the statutes of limitations on these obligations , his manner noticeably frosted .
I was the man who knew too much .
And soon enough I was gone .
But not before internalizing lessons about this industry .
The first is that complaints to the Better Business Bureau and the like are meaningless to the third - party collectors of the world .
Both Tom and Pat said at varying times that we should n’t worry about such things , because the complaints “ had no teeth . ”
That it ’s just the price of doing business .
The second , more salient lesson is one that should worry people who would like to see this activity ceased .
When going into this racket , I wondered how people could do this business .
Now I wonder why more people do n’t .
The return on investment in these loans is potentially astronomical , and operating as a Limited Liability Corporation obviously insulates the proprietors from significant risk .
Law enforcement can’t stop these companies — if one is stopped , a dozen sprout up to replace it .
Complaints , such as they are , end up on the legal backburner — or the Internet , as this one complaint against S&W did .
A complaint that really could have applied to any company in the industry :
“ All these scams are blatantly criminal .
These scammers do n’t even bother to skate close to the edge of legality as in the past .
Now , more and more–even the “ legitimate ” debt collectors , are actively resorting to criminal tactics to defraud people or violate federal consumer law .
You have to ask why ?
The fact is the chances of getting caught are next to zero and even if they are , the penalties are ridiculously inadequate , just the cost of doing a very lucrative criminal business– a laughably small fine and forget jail .
Is it any wonder that with the feds claiming greater concern but doing little and Congress passing empty laws with no teeth , the problem only gets worse ?
It ’s the wild west for the tele - scammers and we are the targets .
Until the government takes these crimes seriously and treats the scammers for what they are , criminals , things will never change . ”
The problem with logic like this is that it essentially is old - school , 20th century thinking .
The government is overwhelmed , lacking the resources to handle things like the coming entitlement crisis and the myriad predators marauding through society .
In the grand scheme of things , payday loan collection is not as serious a crime as rape , murder , assault , et al .
Predation on the weak and stupid is common to all hustles , and whatever punishments might be inflicted on a company like that I worked for are essentially minor .
Nothing will change .
Not as long as there is a resale market for debts .
Not as long as 20 percent of Americans are underemployed or with no work at all .
As with strip clubs and plasma clinics , there is a need for such gigs .
And once you get used to it , once you internalize the logic of the hustle , it is all in a day ’s work .
A.G. Gancarski is a freelance journalist based in Florida .
When Patrick Giger , a 34 - year - old angler from the Swiss village of Horgen , cast his baited line into Lake Zurich 's storm - swollen waters on an icy February morning last year , he could not have forecast the trouble he would end up reeling in alongside the 22lb pike which was soon to snare itself on his hook .
The day ended with the monster fish being devoured by Giger and his friends at a local restaurant , but just a few months later Giger would face , on the instructions of the state prosecutor for the canton of Zurich , criminal prosecution for causing excessive suffering to the animal after boasting to a local newspaper that he had spent around 10 minutes , and exerted considerable physical effort , landing the fish .
The pike has gone on to become something of a poster child for the animal rights movement in Switzerland .
It has even attracted more than 6,000 " fans " on a Facebook page set up in its memory .
But the fate of this fish also acts to highlight the political divisions in Switzerland over just how far to push its animal rights legislation , already hailed as arguably the toughest anywhere in the world .
The ultimate test will come this Sunday when the country will decide in a referendum – or " people 's initiative " – whether an animal should be represented by a lawyer during any criminal trial in which it is judged to be the " victim " .
The canton of Zurich has had just such a lawyer – or " animal advocate " , as the incumbent prefers to be called – since 1991 , but the campaigners who garnered the 100,000 signatures required to automatically trigger a national referendum are now hoping animal advocates will be required by law in all 26 cantons .
Antoine Goetschel , Zurich 's animal advocate since 2007 , acted in court on behalf of the pike two weeks ago when Giger 's trial finally came before a judge .
Giger was subsequently acquitted , but Goetschel is still hopeful that when the judge finally submits his written summary of the trial in the coming weeks he will clarify what time - length is acceptable for a fisherman to land a fish .
For some in Switzerland the apparent absurdity of a dead fish having its own legal counsel – let alone placing such a legal time limit on anglers – displays that the animal rights agenda has now gone too far .
However , supporters of the referendum argue that this strikes at the very ethical and philosophical heart of animal rights : why should n't an animal , they argue , have the same legal right to representation as any other victim in a criminal trial ?
And when you open that particular Pandora 's box , a whole slew of other chewy questions follow .
For example , do all animal species deserve equal rights ?
If an elephant deserves a lawyer , what about that defenceless slug squished underfoot by a vengeful gardener ?
Such questions have been troubling moral philosophers for centuries , but it could soon have a practical application in all of Switzerland 's criminal courts .
" Are fish sentient beings or not ? " asks Goetschel rhetorically , as he thumbs the shelves of his law firm 's library , located in downtown Zurich not much more than a fly cast away from the lake where his client once swam .
" This is the sort of question I am asked to consider in such cases .
This fisherman was boasting that it took him around 10 minutes to bring in the pike .
The state attorney asked me to look into it .
This is my job .
I found a case judgement in Germany that said anything over one minute is too long so I used this as evidence .
It was uncomfortable in the court as I had 40 fishermen against me .
But I ask you this : if we put a hook in the mouth of a puppy and did the same thing for 10 minutes , what would our reaction be ?
With farm animals there is a strict , legally enforceable time limit between capture and death , so why not with fishing ? "
Goetschel rejects his critics who claim this all amounts to yet another money - spinner for lawyers .
He says he handles 150 - 200 animal cases a year which , in total , take up about a third of his time .
" I get paid 200 francs [ £ 124 ] an hour for representing animals , but the fee for my other work is 350 - 500 francs per hour so I do n't do this for the money , " he asserts .
" In 2009 , I received 78,000 francs [ £ 48,000 ] in total – just enough to pay for half an assistant at my office . "
So who does pay for his time ?
Clearly not the pike and all the other animal victims he represents in court .
" I 'm designated by the canton government to do this job for four years , " he says .
" The state pays me , otherwise it would be seen that I 'm too close to being a representative of an animal rights NGO .
For me it is about conviction rather than money .
It 's a thrill for me to make the public think about the animal / human relationship . "
' Not even a vet can act on behalf of an animal in court '
There is a core principle of fair justice that underpins his work , he explains .
Animals can be , and often are , treated poorly by their human masters .
But while this person can defend themselves , the animal cannot .
" Not even a vet can act on behalf of the animal in court . "
In late 2008 , a new animal act passed into law in Switzerland .
It runs to 150 pages and explains in great detail how dozens of species are to be kept and treated by their owners , be they " companion animals " or livestock on a farm .
In November , the law will finally become legally enforceable meaning the owner of , say , a rabbit could be prosecuted for keeping their pet in a hutch that does n't meet the legal criteria .
A dwarf rabbit , for example , must be kept in a hutch no smaller than 50 cm x 70 cm , with 40 cm headroom .
They must also have a nest box , or the " ability to dig " .
( Curiously , gerbils are accorded more head room than rabbits . )
The new rules for dogs are even more exacting .
Dogs are deemed " social animals " and , therefore , " must have daily contact with humans , and , as far as possible , with other dogs " .
If kept in outdoor kennels , they must be " chain free " for at least five hours a day and kept in pairs , or with other " compatible animals " .
It says they must be walked daily , but the act fails to specify for how long or how far ( which has angered some campaigners ) .
And all prospective owners must now complete a four - hour " theory " course before buying a dog then complete a further four hours at a dog school as soon as they take ownership of the animal .
Dogs must only be fed " species specific " food and their " enclosures " must have separate areas for eating , sleeping and toileting .
If only half the world 's human population could be given such guarantees , sniff the critics of the animal act .
" The 2008 law was good for animal protection , " says Goetschel , who can even represent the best interests of a pet in any custody battles resulting from a ( human ) divorce .
" I think the fight about the level of protection is now probably over in Switzerland .
We have the ' dignity of the animal ' recognised in Swiss law .
But there is a struggle between the idealism of the ethics and the realism of the application of the law .
Ethics should be there like a lighthouse to show where to go .
Our high rates of prosecution in the canton of Zurich where we have an animal advocate , compared to the others , shows why someone such as me is needed .
The mentality of the police and state attorneys varies from canton to canton .
They have murders and drugs to deal with so animal cases are often a low priority .
They also have a lack of knowledge about the new law .
The whole of Switzerland would probably need about six to 15 attorneys to cover all the animal cases arising each year . "
Goetschel , a vegetarian without pets who accepts the " hypocrisy of wearing leather shoes and silk ties " , gets far more animated when moving on to the deeper questions about our attitude towards the animals we keep .
" The 2008 law only protects vertebrates , " he says .
" Invertebrates are deemed not to suffer pain so were left out .
Five classes are covered by the law : birds , reptiles , amphibians , mammals and fish .
This only accounts for 5 % of the animal world .
But securing the ' dignity of plants ' has now even been discussed .
It can all lead to some interesting dilemmas .
For example , what about the scientist who is trying to make a flea with 12 eyes ?
Who is representing the dignity of this creature ? "
A matter of dignity
So should all forms of life on this planet have rights enshrined in law ?
" I happen to believe that invertebrates are more or less equal to vertebrates .
This thinking is n't new .
In the 19th century , a man in the UK was prosecuted for leaving his scorpions to die .
It was the UK in 1822 who introduced the world 's first animal welfare law with the Act to Prevent the Cruel and Improper Treatment of Cattle .
It was Jeremy Bentham 's thinking that invertebrates should have common value to other animals and I share this view .
Snails and fleas are used in lab experiments ; they should have some form of representation .
It 's the principle of their use that is important to me rather than the individual animals themselves .
I believe that we increase our own dignity when we increase the dignity of others . "
Goetschel accepts that the pike was one of his more unusual clients .
The species he represents the most are , in order , dogs , cows , cats and pigs .
But he is ever wary of what he calls the " puppy trap " .
" There is a danger that we only try to protect the animals we think are cute , " he says .
" I must strip myself of emotion .
How would you choose to prosecute the person who cut the head off a cat with a knife versus the person who did n't give any food and water to their cat for two weeks causing it to die ?
Which cat suffered more ?
Suffering and dignity should be what guide you , not emotions . "
The role of organisations such as the UK's RSPCA is important , he says , but an extra level of protection is required in his view .
" The RSPCA in the UK can act as ' non- instructed policemen ' , " he says .
" But the RSPCA does not have the legal right to represent the animal in court .
I can ask a question to a witness .
I can make an appeal .
My position can be very useful .
For example , I represented 70 dogs that had been mistreated by their owner .
The state attorney asked if I wanted to write up all their cases individually .
But I said , let 's just pick three representative dogs and we were able to do a plea bargain as a result .
Without me , this case could have potentially taken a year . "
Goetschel admits to being nervous about the result of Sunday 's referendum .
It 's too close to call , he says .
But would he like to see other countries following Switzerland 's lead ?
" The Swiss have made steps that would be nice to see implemented in other countries – the French , for example , say the keeping of an animal is a basic human right – but I 'm not proud of Switzerland just yet . "
Peter Singer , the professor of bioethics at Princeton University and author of Animal Liberation , the book many credit with kick - starting the modern animal rights movement in the 1970s , says he is thrilled that the Swiss are voting to take what he sees as such a progressive step : " I have always argued that it should be possible for animals to be represented in court by guardians , or lawyers , acting on their behalf , much as we do for people with disabilities . "
It is a positive move towards what he would describe as his dream scenario : " Ideally , you would have laws requiring that we give equal considering to an animal 's interests where their interests are similar to ours , that we do not discount their interests merely because they are not human .
The details are going to vary according to the species and according to why the animal is being kept .
You 're either going to have very complicated legislation , or you 're going to have procedures that set up committees and tribunals in order to decide what is the proper way to keep animals which will range across the species .
But if you 're talking about a perfect world , we 're not there yet .
Are we going to cease using animals for food , for example ?
That 's not an issue that 's up for vote in the Swiss referendum .
They 're not going to stop making their cheese . "
Recent polling indicates that the " Yes " campaigners might achieve 70 % of the popular vote on Sunday , but over the last week the " No " campaign leaders have called for a letter - writing campaign to newspapers – a strong political tradition in Switzerland – and the pages have been filled with dissenting views about the need for animal advocates across the country .
' If I was a chicken I 'd want to live in Switzerland '
" Let me say straight away that I support our 2008 animal protection laws , " says Hannes Germann , a senator for the canton of Schaffhausen and prominent member of the Swiss People 's party , the rightwing party that successfully campaigned last year for a building ban on minarets in Switzerland .
" But it is enough .
If you ask people what is important for this country at this time , it is not yet more bureaucracy and the needless spending of tax - payers ' money .
We have bigger issues to fight than this . "
The " Yes " campaigners reject the idea that animal advocates are a luxury .
Eva Waiblinger , a zoologist who works as the " companion animal welfare specialist " for the animal rights group Schweizer Tierschutz ( Swiss Animal Protection ) , says that Goetschel only costs each taxpayer in Zurich canton 8 Swiss cents a year .
She says she is hopeful , but nervous about Sunday 's vote .
( The result will not hinge on the national popular vote , but whether a majority of cantons support the initiative .
It 's this that campaigners on both sides say is on a knife - edge . )
" Anglers and farmers are against us , " she says .
" But the Swiss Kennel Club is supporting us , as are most of the newspapers . "
The intention of animal advocates , she says , is simply to better enforce the 2008 animal welfare act .
She is pleased with the new guarantees of protection – " If I was a chicken I 'd want to live in Switzerland " – but thinks they could have gone even further in places : " There is a problem with species - ism in the act .
It encourages what is in effect racism against certain species .
That 's my problem with it all . "
But when viewed against the protection animals get in other countries , she says she is proud that Switzerland leads the world in animal protection .
" When I came to London recently I was shocked to see puppies and kittens for sale in Harrods , " she says .
" They even had plastic hamster balls which you can put on the floor and watch the hamster running inside as the ball rolls around .
If I 'd seen this in Switzerland , I would have gone to the police . "
Here 's a pic of Zyre 's replacement :
Alrighty guys .
It 's been a while , 1.63 years since my L4/5 M6 surgery with Nicholas Boeree , may his soul rest in peace .
So it seems the issue with tightness in my back has been my facets all along .
I opted for a Facet Block a few months ago .
That stopped working after 2 weeks .
I then got another one , which , again , lasted only 2 weeks .
A month ago I opted for a facet denervation .
I thought this would do the job , but again , only worked for 2 weeks .
I 'll be getting a booster denervation next month , but i'm already looking at surgical options here .
It 's getting unbearable .
I wake up with my facets flared up , EVERY MORNING .
My lower back muscles are constantly tight and I was forced to buy a Precor Stretch Trainer , which I now have at home and use constantly .
I asked Dr. Jose Joy , an orthopedic surgeon that fused my mom's back 6 weeks ago .
He said i'm looking at a fusion in the future .
But then again , I REFUSE TO FUSE .
I 'm looking at alternatives , of which I 've found 2:1 .
The Glyder Facet Resurfacing by Zyga with Dr. Pimenta ( http://www.zygatech.com/index.php)2. Zyre Facet Replacement with Bertagnoli ( http://www.dr-bertagnoli.com/facet-replacement.html)I've seen other companies that offered solution but seemed a lot more intrusive and involved a whole bunch of bone cutting .
Those companies have dissolved , like Archus Orthopedics .
Anyways , if anyone has any experience with any of these devices , or has any additional ones you might want to add to the reading list , please let me know .
As to why the facets are failing , it could be the M6 allowing too much motion in that segment .
I can't imagine a prodisc or any other ADR given how unconstrained the motion is .
At least the M6 is constrained .
But anyways , I believe ADR with a facet replacement is the absolute total solutions to lower back problems .
My disc has n't given me any issues whatsoever except for this .
Used in conjuction with a treatment like facet replacement , i'd be happy moving forward with my life .
I know absolutely nothing about how these devices work .
The glyder seems interesting but i'm not sure how it would attach to the facet .
Here 's a pic of the Zyga 's Glyder :
Here 's the assumption : to prevent women being victimised or exploited there must be prohibitions on female sexuality , and things certain women do made illegal for their own good .
In my university days , dancing in striptease clubs , I heard countless variations on that theme .
Oddly enough , they rarely came from religious misogynists , but campus feminists who insisted my dancing in spangled bikinis damaged the sisterhood .
It also made me enough money to live comfortably while attending school , but my detractors did n't care .
And their strain of feminism reigns in Iceland , which has banned strip clubs , topless bars and any business model where people make money off nudity .
The ban is the brainchild of politician Kolbrún Halldórsdóttir , who feels it necessary because : " It is not acceptable that women or people in general are a product to be sold . "
Which is true , but a non-sequitur .
Halldórsdóttir falls for the same falsehood my militant classmates did : professionally sexy women must always be exploited , whether we thought so or not .
Such logic pervades feminist ( rather than religious ) campaigns to abolish the sex industries .
Iceland is far down that path ; it outlawed prostitution last year , though it 's a safe bet there are still hookers on the island , working for the criminal underground rather than legal , licensed businesses .
Opponents like Halldórsdóttir think the sex " industry " must be synonymous with sex " slavery , " without understanding that driving such industries underground only increases the likelihood its participants will be victimised .
Illegal sex slavery unfortunately does exist , but the problem is the slavery , not the sex .
The crusaders refuse to believe any woman could rationally choose a job like dancing , because " I 'd never want to , therefore nobody could want to , therefore nobody 's allowed to " .
When did feminism get so solipsistic ?
I remember tracts from the second wave of the 1970s and 80s , when feminism was about " choices " .
But nouveau feminists can't stand women making choices they do n't approve of , and support women 's rights as their religious counterparts do : by banning what offends them .
A few years ago , I was sent to cover an Islamic discussion forum at a conservative local mosque .
But the forum was in the men's section , where no man would talk to or even look at me .
I was none - too - subtly herded into the dingy women 's section , to watch the proceedings on a small closed - circuit TV .
I asked the women how they tolerated having half of humanity off - limits to them .
They gave answers heavily peppered with the words " beauty " and " respect " .
See , men find women 's beauty distracting , so beauty must be hidden lest men be too distracted to respect women .
Apparently , men can think " there 's a sexy woman " or " there 's someone I respect " , but never both at once , so female behaviour must be curtailed to reflect that .
And modern feminists nod and agree – and promote women 's rights by restricting women 's choices .
I 'm lucky they held no authority over me when I was 18 , and could n't afford school unless I made exponentially more than the average part - time wage .
Given Iceland 's dismal economic state , I hope my doppelganger in Reykjavik overcomes the new limits on her options , imposed for her own liberation .

It rattles along at 20 miles an hour , swaying back and forth on uneven rails , the engine so loud it makes your teeth hurt .
Then , rather unceremoniously , it runs out of gas and dies .
And you find yourself stranded in the middle of Cambodia on a handmade “ norry ” train , feeling a bit exposed on a 25 - square - foot platform made of bamboo and scrap metal attached to wheels salvaged from old tanks .
Picture one of those hand - pump rail cars depicted in old Westerns , and you ’re close .
It ’s powered ( when it has gas ) by a converted outboard engine .
The brakes ( when it has gas and you need brakes ) are a wooden board pushed against the wheels .
No seats .
All this bamboo and scrap metal give it a makeshift appearance , and appearances do not deceive .
Pretty soon , driver Path Chanthorn starts pushing the disabled norry with hands that are missing a few fingers from a run-in with a water buffalo -- “ a strong cow , ” he mutters .
Advertisement
Another norry approaches from the opposite direction , every inch of its platform covered by a dozen people headed for a festival .
With a single track to ride on , etiquette dictates that the norry with the lighter load be taken apart so the other can pass .
So Chanthorn and his assistant quickly dismantle their vehicle and let the other one by , then put theirs back together again , all within minutes .
And you are on your way .
Now a government plan to upgrade the country ’s rail system may end up forever stranding the norry , an ingenious response to the decades of war , destruction and dire poverty that have afflicted Cambodia .
Under the Khmer Rouge in the mid-1970s , as the country descended into civil war and mass murder , 2 million people perished .
And in leader Pol Pot ’s quest to reach “ Year Zero , ” Cambodia also saw most of its roads destroyed , its trucks blown up , its locomotives charred .
Advertisement
By the early 1980s , as Cambodia started to emerge from the nightmare , people remembered the small vehicles used by rail workers in the 1960s to repair the tracks and started building their own .
The norry , a name some say is derived from a mispronunciation of “ lorry , ” was born .
The humble norry is a reminder of how much Cambodians lost , but it also speaks to their persevering spirit .
All but left for dead under Pol Pot ’s genocidal regime , they defied the odds to rebuild , sometimes literally :
Witness the land mine victims who picked up their lives by crafting homemade wooden limbs .
“ It shows how ingenious people can be , ” says Ith Sorn , 55 , who ’s been driving norries for three decades .
“ Cambodians came up with this when they had almost nothing . ”
The unique mode of transportation saw its heyday in the 1980s when other vehicles were scarce .
“ There were bombs and mines everywhere , roads were destroyed and rail cars a shambles , ” says Kot Sareurn , 50 , a union leader for 23 norry drivers in Battambang , a picturesque provincial capital along the tranquil Sangker River .
“ Norries helped a lot of people survive , get to hospitals , get food . ”
Advertisement
Initially operators “ rowed ” the norries with poles , gondola - style , carrying loads of up to 40 people , eight cows or three tons of rice .
After a few years , small gas engines were added .
Drivers said that at the peak , thousands of norries operated throughout Cambodia , charging villagers only a few cents for a ride but still making a decent living with so many people and possessions jammed aboard .
These days , the few hundred remaining norries are relegated to short distances in a few provinces , more an oddity for tourists than the lifeblood they once represented , as trucks , public buses and motorbikes fill the gap .
They ’re still privately owned , but nowadays companies sometimes own several of them , splitting the profits with drivers .
Safety ?
Not a problem , Sorn says : “ I ’ve never had a bad accident .
Only occasionally , if it ’s overloaded , we ’ll break down and some goats tumble off . ”
Advertisement
They ’ve clung to life thanks to the tourists and Cambodia ’s catatonic rail system .
The last train anyone saw around Battambang ’s Odombang station lumbered through more than a year ago .
The norry drivers have since taken over the tiny station , sleeping in hammocks on the platform , littering its dirt floor with their cigarette wrappers .
But there ’s movement down the line .
The government plans to revamp the nation ’s two modest state - owned rail lines -- a 230 - mile stretch from Phnom Penh to the border with Thailand completed by the French in 1942 , and a 150 - mile stretch from the capital to the southwestern Sihanoukville port finished with help from China and Germany in 1969 .
Government officials envision turning the system over to private operators by early 2012 .
This would almost certainly see the go - cart - like norries muscled aside by “ real ” trains .
” Norries are dangerous , shabby - looking and wo n’t last in the 21st high - tech century , ” says Touch Chankosal , an official with the Ministry of Public Works and Transport .
“ Real trains going at over 30 miles per hour would run right over them .
The drivers ’ lives are worth more than preserving norries . ”
Advertisement
Union leader Sareurn has little nostalgia for the contraptions that have earned his keep for decades .
“ If the government provides compensation , we ’ll all stop the next day , ” he says .
Others are n’t quite so sanguine .
“ I ’m worried , but what can you do ? ” says Chanthorn , 37 , who ’s been driving since he was 10 .
“ The rails belong to the government .
We ’re just borrowing them . ”
During the Khmer Rouge days , there were no norries , only endless walking by starving people , Sorn says in his house beside the tracks made of beams and tin .
His wife , Dorn Mao , 50 , shows where she was hacked with a machete by a Khmer Rouge fighter for taking a few bananas .
“ It ’s hard to think about , ” she says .
Recently , more foreigners have been riding his norry , Sorn says , including three with big bellies who initially balked , thinking it too flimsy to support them .

“ They worried that the bamboo would break , but bamboo is very strong , ” he says .
“ If I can carry eight cows , I can certainly carry a few fat foreigners . ”

Tuesday , December 9th , Southwold
At Gospel Oak station by a quarter to nine to combine a visit to Southwold with my first opportunity to thoroughly revise the Time Bandits for publication at Easter .
[ Michael had co-written the Time Bandits screenplay with the director , fellow Python Terry Gilliam , and also appeared in the film , which had been shot but was then still in postproduction . ]
It 's a dull and nondescript morning -- the shabby , greying clouds have warmed the place up a bit , but that 's all .
I reach the station in good time .
Holly Jones is waiting for her train to school , having just missed the one in front with all her friends on .
It 's she who tells me that over in New York John Lennon has been shot dead .
A plunge into unreality , or at least into the area of where comprehension slips and the world seems an orderless swirl of disconnected , arbitrary events .
How does such a thing happen ?
How do I , on this grubby station platform in north - west London , begin to comprehend the killing of one of the Beatles ?
The Rolling Stones were always on the knife - edge of life and death and sudden tragedy was part of their lives , but the Beatles seemed the mortal immortals , the legend that would live and grow old with us .
But now , this ordinary December morning , I learn from a schoolgirl that one of my heroes has been shot dead .
My feelings are of indefinable but deeply - felt anger at America .
This is , after all , the sort of random slaying of a charismatic , much - loved figure in which America has specialised in the last two decades .
Once I get to Southwold I ring George . *
And leave a message , because he 's not answering .
I work through for a five - hour stretch and we have a drink together by the fire and watch tributes to John Lennon , clumsily put together by newsroom staff who know a good story better than they know good music .
And Paul McCartney just says ' It 's a drag ' and , creditably I think , refuses to emote for the cameras .
What a black day for music .
The killer was apparently a fan .
The dark side of Beatlemania .
The curse that stalks all modern heroes , but is almost unchecked in America -- land of the free and the armed and the crazy .
The cinema is full and I like the film very much indeed .
But I can see that my appreciation of some of the scenes depicting horrific excesses of fan worship comes from having experienced this sort of thing and viewed from the other side , this could be seen as Allen kicking his fans in the teeth .
Though my foot still throbs angrily , I feel the worst is over .
I have been cured by a Woody Allen movie !
#
When I came across this December 1980 entry in Michael Palin 's newly published Diaries 1980 - 1988 : Halfway to Hollywood and realized I had to share it , for a moment I was disappointed that we 'd missed the anniversary by just a week - and - a - bit .
Then I was relieved ; it 's not an occasion I would want to feel as if we were " celebrating .
"
As the entry begins , Michael is on the railway platform near his home in northwest London , waiting for a train that will eventually take him to Southwold on the Suffolk coast , where his mother lives .
He runs into a schoolmate of his 11 - year - old son Tom , who delivers news that alters his world .
By odd chance , a week - and - change later Michael -- in agony with a foot problem that seems to become more painful after each treatment -- hobbles with his wife ( who " has looked in her books and is bandying words like ' toxaemia ' around " ) to an opening - night showing of Woody Allen 's , which is steeped in its creator 's discomfort with his too - admiring fans .

Michele Bachmann , the outspoken conservative House representative from Minnesota , says the United States will cease to exist if it “ fails to stand ” with Israel .
“ I am convinced in my heart and in my mind that if the United States fails to stand with Israel , that is the end of the United States , ” Bachmann said at a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Los Angeles on Feb .

Bachmann went on to explain that God ’s special relationship with Israel means the US would be cursed if it were to oppose Israeli policies .
“ We have to show that we are inextricably entwined , that as a nation we have been blessed because of our relationship with Israel , and if we reject Israel , then there is a curse that comes into play , ” Bachmann said .
The congresswoman ’s comments went under the radar until Andy Birkey reported on them at the Minnesota Independent .
Citing a transcript from the Israeli affairs blog Israpundit , Birkey summed up Bachmann ’s position as : “ Support for Israel is handed down by God and if the United States pulls back its support , America will cease to exist . ”
Many Republicans have criticized the Obama administration for taking a tougher line with Israel than its predecessors .
In the wake of the 2008 - 2009 Gaza war last year , which saw some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis killed , the White House has been putting pressure on Israel to make concessions in the peace process .

Bachmann , who was elected to the US House in 2006 , has positioned herself close to the Republican Party ’s populist , right - wing flank , seemingly taking her cues from right - wing talk radio and conservative Web sites .
She declared last year her intention of not filling out the 2010 census form — a federal offense — because she believes it will be skewed by the Obama administration for political purposes .
Bachmann has also argued against the right of the accused 9/11 plotters to be put on trial , arguing that such rights are “ preserved for American citizens . ”
She has dubbed proposed climate - change legislation “ tyranny . ”

While Bachmann has opposed government intervention in the economy , including President Obama ’s stimulus package , Raw Story reported that she and her family have received nearly a quarter of a million dollars in farm subsidies over the past decade .
Scientists at the University of Essex have a greater understanding of how our genes are controlled following a major research project .
The findings of the study , which looked at how proteins work as teams to control genes in the cells , could also help to unravel the mechanisms of disease such as cancer .
The five - year research , funded by the Medical Research Council , has been published in Molecular and Cellular Biology .
The research team , led by Dr Elena Klenova from the Department of Biological Sciences , looked at the protein called CTCF , which was previously identified as a key ' controller ' of many of our genes , making them either active or inactive .
However , the scientists at Essex have discovered that other proteins were working with CTCF for fine tuning of the genes .
This collaboration between CTCF and its neighbours at the molecular level provides the mechanism by which CTCF 's function as a gene regulator is controlled .
Dr Dawn Farrar , the principal researcher on the project , said the discovery of the link between CTCF and other proteins was a ' fascinating example of molecular teamwork ' .
Dr Klenova , said : ' Understanding the factors responsible for the regulation of our genes , and how , why and when particular genes are switched on and off may give us a greater understanding of general biological systems .
It also helps us to unravel the mechanisms of disease such as cancer .
We believe that our published study has contributed to present knowledge of gene regulation . '
It is hoped scientists will be able to build on this research -- which was undertaken in collaboration with the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute and Karolinska Institute in Sweden -- to further understand the factors responsible for the regulation of our genes , and how this can lead to disease .
Omar Khadr is shown appearing earlier in a military court at the U.S. naval prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Canadian Omar Khadr showed up at the afternoon portion of his pretrial hearing at Guantanamo Bay on Thursday after refusing to go in the morning , but he did so in " extreme pain , " his lawyers said .
Toronto - born Khadr , who is accused by the United States of murder , conspiracy and supporting terrorism in the Afghan war , did n't attend the morning proceedings of his military trial because he was asked to wear blackout goggles and earmuffs on the way to court .
The guards at the U.S. naval base in Cuba wanted to prevent him from seeing and hearing while he was being transported in a secure van , something Khadr 's lawyer said he 's never been required to do before .
Khadr refused to wear the eye and ear coverings , saying they were meant to humiliate him .
The guards refused to move him to court without the headgear .
Col .
Patrick Parrish , the military judge in charge of the pretrial proceedings , postponed the hearing until the afternoon but said it could proceed without Khadr if necessary .
Khadr 's lawyers , having been instructed by Parrish to talk to their client , had the 23 - year - old brought back to the tribunal for the afternoon session , but Khadr , who is blind in his left eye , appeared to be suffering .
Khadr had received medical treatment earlier in the morning for an outbreak of conjunctivitis , an eye inflammation , his lawyers said .
" He 's sitting there at the bench , slumped .
He 's got his hands over his eyes , he 's wiping his eyes with tissue , " the CBC's Bill Gillespie reported from Guantanamo Bay .
" And his lawyers are saying ... he 's in extreme pain . "
Parrish ordered that the case proceed , and the tribunal heard from an FBI agent who had interrogated Khadr .
Khadr is accused of tossing a hand grenade that killed a U.S. medic during a battle in Afghanistan near the Pakistani border in 2002 .
Defence rejects plea offer
His defence team has already rejected a plea - bargain offer from U.S. military prosecutors that would have forced him to serve a sentence in a U.S. prison , one of his lawyers said .
" It was 13 years that was offered , " Dennis Edney , Khadr 's Canadian lawyer , told CBC News .
" Time served and Mr. Khadr would spend five years in a maximum - security prison in the United States . "
Edney , who declined to explain exactly why the defence did n't accept the offer , said part of the problem was that it would have required Khadr to serve the rest of his sentence in the U.S. , instead of Canada .
" I 'm prepared to consider anything that brings Omar Khadr back to Canada , " Edney said .
Khadr has been imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay since he was arrested in Afghanistan at age 15 .
He is facing a possible life sentence if convicted .
Human rights groups have decried his detention because international law requires combatants under age 18 to be treated as child soldiers and as victims in need of rehabilitation and reintegration .
Washington - based lawyer Barry Coburn , who is leading Khadr 's defence team at Guantanamo Bay , confirmed that lawyers were discussing plea bargains .
He said the prosecution is insisting that Khadr publicly admit he threw the grenade that killed an American soldier in Afghanistan as part of any possible plea — something Khadr wo n't do , Coburn said .
New rules released
Khadr 's case is the first to be heard by a military commission since U.S. President Barack Obama instituted reforms that are supposed to make the system fairer for defendants .
Obama had initially said he would abandon the commissions altogether but changed his mind after temporarily suspending them within hours of taking office in January 2009 .
The military commission manual , implementing laws enacted by the Obama administration last year , was only made available to counsel at Guantanamo Bay on Tuesday evening .
The manual is important to Khadr 's defence team , since the pretrial proceedings this week centre on whether self - incriminating statements will be admissible at his trial .
The defence said it will seek to have the confessions thrown out , arguing that Khadr made the statements only to avoid torture .
The prosecution , on the other hand , insists Khadr 's claims of torture are baseless and self - serving , and that the various statements should be allowed as evidence .
A number of military interrogators who interviewed Khadr after he was captured are scheduled to appear at the hearing in the coming days .
The new rules also make explicit a new Pentagon policy that even if a prisoner is acquitted at a Guantanamo military tribunal , they can still be detained indefinitely .
DURHAM , N.C. --
A study of extinction patterns of 25 large mammal species in India finds that improving existing protected areas , creating new areas , and interconnecting them will be necessary for many species to survive this century .
The study , by a team of researchers from the United States and India , appears in the March 10 online edition of the British peer - reviewed journal , Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
The team 's analysis showed that forest cover and local human population densities are also key factors .
Fostering greater human cultural tolerance for wildlife likewise will be critical .
The study examined extinction probabilities for a range of species .
It looked at species considered endangered or critically endangered on the 2009 International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List of Threatened Species , including tigers , lions and elephants .
And it looked at species of least concern , including jackals , wolves and other species .
" India 's fragmented network of relatively small protected areas has high carrying capacities for large mammals , " said Krithi K. Karanth , who conducted the study as part of her doctoral thesis at Duke 's Nicholas School of the Environment .
" But given the overall patterns of extinction estimated in our study , we need to create new areas , and connect them better , if many of the mammals are to persist into the future . "
Karanth currently is a postdoctoral scientist at Columbia University .
She also is a research associate of the Centre for Wildlife Studies in Bangalore , India .
To identify factors critical to the species ' survival and estimate their extinction probabilities , she and her team collected 30,000 records , including hunting , taxidermy and museum records dating back to 1850 .
They divided India 's geographical area into a grid with 1,326 individual local " cells " and entered the historical data into each cell .
They then used occupancy estimation models , based on observations of more than 100 local wildlife experts , to infer the current occurrence of species in each cell .
Their analysis revealed that protected areas were associated with lower extinction probabilities for 18 species .
Higher proportion of forest cover was associated with lower extinction of seven species .
On the other hand , time elapsed since the last historical citing was associated with higher extinction probabilities of 14 species , and human population density in a cell was associated with higher extinction probabilities of 13 species .
One of the most important findings , Karanth noted , is that culturally tolerated species - animals that humans perceive as nonthreatening or beneficial - fared better overall .
Using both historical data and current occupancy estimation models allowed Karanth and her team to distinguish more clearly between when a species was truly absent or locally extinct in a cell , and when it likely still exists but has n't been detected in recent surveys or field observations .
" Distinguishing between a species ' absence and its simple non-detection is critical for accuracy , " she said .
" Failure to deal with non-detection results in underestimates of species occupancy and overestimates of local extinctions .
This clouds our ability to determine the true impact of environmental and social factors on extinctions . "
Karanth added that for conservation to succeed , policymakers and land managers must also take into account rapid changes in land use , climate , population growth and spread , and economic development now occurring in India and southern Asia .

Her co-authors on the study were Norman L. Christensen Jr. , professor of ecology at Duke 's Nicholas School ; James D. Nichols and James E. Hines of the U.S. Geological Survey Biological Resources Division 's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center ; and K. Ullas Karanth of the Wildlife Conservation Society India Program and the Centre for Wildlife Studies in Bangalore .
Human brains are about three times as large as those of our early australopithecines ancestors that lived 4 million to 2 million years ago , and for years , scientists have wondered how our brains got so big .
A new study suggests social competition could be behind the increase in brain size .
By stimulating a certain region of the brain , scientists can alter a person 's ability to make moral judgments .
When people hear news of a crime like a shooting , they likely need more information before they can judge the offender 's actions as right or wrong — was the crime accidental or intentional ?
If it was an accident or if the shooter was defending him or herself , people are likely to see the act as much more morally acceptable than if it was deliberate and unwarranted .
The study results show that stimulating a specific brain region interfered with the participants ' ability to consider this mental state information when assessing hypothetical situations dealing with morality .
For instance , participants who received this brain stimulation were more likely to judge as morally acceptable scenarios involving attempted harms — where a person intends , but fails to carry out a crime , like an attempted poisoning .
Even though the researchers went into the study suspecting they might see such a pattern , they were quite surprised by the results .
" It was still surprising to us that we were able to actually change people 's moral judgments by disrupting activity in this specific brain region , just because moral judgment is obviously really complicated and depends on a number of factors , " said study author Liane Young , a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
" So the kind of precise deficit that we found was really striking . "
Previous work had suggested that a brain region known as the right temporoparietal junction ( TPJ ) , located on the brain 's outer layer near the right ear , was involved in making moral judgments .
These studies , however , were based on fMRI brain imaging experiments , which cannot directly test whether a certain brain area is involved in a specific function .
Instead , Young and her colleagues used a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation to directly disrupt activity in the right TPJ .
The method applies a magnetic field to a small area of the head , which interferes with the brain cells ' ability to work properly .
However , the effect is only temporary , and the technique is not invasive .
In one experiment , eight participants first received brain stimulations , then read through several scenarios and were asked to judge the characters ' actions on a morality scale , ranging from 1 ( absolutely forbidden ) to 7 ( absolutely permissible ) .
In another experiment , 12 participants rated the moral scenarios , but this time the stimulation was given precisely when the subjects were making their moral judgments .
In both tests , stimulation to the TPJ caused subjects to have trouble judging scenarios in which the characters ' intention and the ultimate conclusion of the situation did n't match up .
" They judged failed attempts to harm , where no harm was actually done , as more permissible , and accidents , where harm was actually done in spite of a good intention , as [ more ] morally forbidden , " Young said .
The stimulation might have caused subjects to have trouble interpreting intentions , and so they used other information , like the situation outcome , to make their judgments .
The results were published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

If the Internet wins the Nobel Peace Prize , do we all get a trophy ?
Several nominees for the prestigious 2010 prize , which was awarded last year to President Obama , surfaced on Wednesday in news reports .
Among them : " The Internet " and , separately , several of the Web 's creators , including Larry Roberts , Vint Cerf and Tim Berners - Lee , who is pictured above .
If one of those guys wins , it 's pretty clear who would receive the award .
But if the Internet wins ?
No one seems to know what would happen then .
Maybe give it to Al Gore ?
The Internet 's credentials are n't bad .
Recently , it helped speed relief efforts to Haiti and organized protesters in Iran .
Wired Magazine in Italy , which has been advocating for the nomination , says it spreads " dialogue , debate and consensus . "
That and , as Chatroulette showed us , porn .
The truth is that the Internet is designed as a fairly neutral platform - and it's used both for good and ill .
That 's perhaps why the nomination has sparked so much debate - ahem - on the Internet .
Some Web sites , including the tech blog Mashable , have asked whether Wired Magazine in Italy is raising the issue to try to get publicity .
One commenter on that blog wrote : " This is a really dumb idea for a bunch of smart people ... I think it is just a publicity stunt on Wired 's part . "
Others say it 's silly to give the Nobel Peace Prize to a thing instead of a person .
The who - will - accept - this - award thread is becoming a running joke online :
" If the Internet wins the Nobel Peace Prize , I really hope a cat accepts the award , " Twitter user @joyengel wrote , in an apparent reference to the goofy LOLcats meme .
The Internet has an unprecedented amount of competition .
There were more Nobel Peace Prize nominees - 237 – this year than ever before , according to news reports .
Not all of the Peace Prize nominations have been made public .
Lots of people , from professors to government officials , can submit nominations for the prize .
The prize winner will be announced in October .
If the Internet wins , who do you think should get the prize ?
And do you think it would be deserved ?

A recent story in the S.F. Chronicle Real Estate section neatly illustrates the trajectory of tens of millions of Baby Boomer home buyers and owners : Home Appreciation : Concord home steady , secure during ' roller coaster '
The couple bought their first home in a modest suburb in the late 1970s for an undisclosed price , then bought a home in another suburb in 1980 for $ 96,000 .
In 1987 they sold that residence for $ 110,000 and bought another one for $ 135,000 .
They then sold that house for $ 400,000 in 2002 and bought their current home for a price " in the $ 600,000s " ( realtor - speak for about $ 650,000 ) .
After peaking in value at the bubble top in 2005 - 06 at around $ 1,000,000 , the home is now on the market for $ 637,000 ( $ 600,000 + 6 % commission ) .
To peek under the hood of the larger trends , I 've laid out each buy / sell along with its inflation adjusted value in current dollars .
As always , I use the BLS inflation calculator ; though it reflects the flaws of the CPI calculation methodology , it is consistent .
1980 purchase : $ 96,000
in 2010 dollars : $ 252,000
1987 sale : $ 110,000
in 2010 dollars : $ 210,000
1987 purchase : $ 135,000
in 2010 dollars : $ 257,000
2002 sale : $ 400,000
in 2010 dollars : $ 482,000
2002 purchase : $ 650,000
in 2010 dollars : $ 783,000
2010 sale : ( projected ) $ 637,000
These inflation - adjusted " real " numbers are insightfully different from the nominal prices .
To place the 1980 valuations in proper context , we need to recall that the U.S. was suffering from sky - high inflation in the late 70s and extremely high rates of new household formation as the 78 millon Baby Boomers went out and bought houses .
Those two factors created a housing boom , both in valuations and homes built .
It took $ 1.36 in 1980 to buy what $ 1 had bought a mere three years before in 1977 .
As people fled the stock market for tangible assets and Boomers started families , real estate soared ( as did gold ) .
While I do n't have the numbers for that house bought for $ 96,000 in 1980 , anecdotally I can assure you that homes in that price range had sold for $ 45,000 or less in the early 1970s .
Yes , real estate doubled in the high - inflation , Boomer dominated 1970s .
As a result , the $ 96,000 paid in 1980 was actually very pricey .
We can see this in the fact that seven years later , the house had actually declined 17 % in inflation - adjusted terms .
The 1970s mini-bubble in real estate collapsed in the early 1980s as interest rates shot up to 16 % and high mortgage rates raised the costs of borrowing to levels which precluded high sales prices : nobody could afford to pay 1979 prices for houses when mortgage rates were 13 % and up .
As the economy grew in the credit and deficit - fueled Great Bull Market of 1982 - 2007 , housing ramped up as interest rates declined for 28 years ( with brief counter - trends ) .
As a result , the 1987 valuation of the house almost doubled ( in real terms ) in 15 years when it was sold in 2002 .
The fact that the 2002 price of $ 650,000 works out to $ 783,000 in today 's dollars reveals that inflation is n't quite as benign as we are generally led to believe .
The $ 650,000 purchase price in 2002 also reveals that a significant chunk of the housing bubble appreciation had already occurred ( at least in California ) as early as 2002 .
As this example illustrates , prices has retraced to 2001 - 2002 levels in California :
What is missing from a comparison of nominal valuations is the inflation - adjusted loss of roughly $ 150,000 from the 2002 adjusted value of $ 783,000 to the current post - bubble valuation of $ 637,000 ( assuming they sell the home for the asking price ) .
While this household will probably reckon that they more or less exited their house with a modest loss , the inflation - adjusted numbers tell a somewhat less benign story .
Yes , mortgage interest deductions and a host of other home ownership tax breaks soften this decline in value , but this comparison of " real " numbers suggests that even people who bought early in the decade , at the beginning of the housing bubble , are facing real losses far in excess of what nominal prices reveal .
There are strong headwinds to any future price appreciation in ' real " terms .
Most importantly , as this story illustrates , Baby Boomers no longer need giant houses , second homes , investment properties , etc .
They are downsizing and selling off surplus real estate to raise cash for retirement and to pay down staggering debt loads .
Meanwhile , the generations behind -- Gen X and Y - - are smaller in size and not yet the recipients of their parents ' wealth -- which is increasingly shaky .
Put these two demographic trends together and you get rising supply of housing which will swamp any potential future demand .
Here are some other headwinds : prices are still much higher than historic averages , defaults and foreclosures are rising fast , and major mortgage resets ( including " interest only " loans which revert to paying principal ) are still ahead .
Rising interest rates offer yet another headwind to rising home valuations .
Add all these factors together and there is simply no factual basis for expectations of a " recovery " of housing values to bubble - era heights .
Lagniappe projection .
Housing bubble authority Robert Shiller found that over a long period of time , housing rises about 1 % in adjusted terms per year .
If this were to continue to be valid , then we can project that the current " realistic " valuation of the house which sold for $ 210,000 ( in 2010 dollars ) in 1987 would be about 25 % higher , or $ 262,000 , today .
Anything above that price is bubble - era margin which will disappear as prices revert to pre-bubble valuations .

With regard to creative writing , I can say that Internet has ruined my life .
Up to 1999 - 2000 , my production ( poems , short stories , two novels — a short one and a longer , more complex one ) had been quite prolific and without serious writer ’s blocks .
Then the Web , electronic mail , newsgroups , etc. , began a slow but inexorable erosion process : of my time , my energies , my ability to concentrate on a story and forget about the world outside .
The time devoted to writing has grown thinner and thinner and today it ’s almost nonexistent .
The cruel irony is that because of what I do for a living and also thanks to my many technology - related interests , I find myself reading and writing on my Mac(s ) all day , something that frustrates a lot of my creative side .
I soon came to the conclusion that it is not possible — for me at least — to creatively write sitting at the same desk , in front of the same setup where I work , read news , manage email , navigate the Web .
When your main system is capable of keeping multiple applications open , it ’s easy to be distracted by incoming emails and updated RSS feeds .
Not to mention the temptation to search the Web by following the spur of the moment — when that happens , the best case scenario is that I find myself two hours later digesting a lot of information I found following link after link , yet without doing anything really productive .
The solution is to configure a setup without an Internet connection .
No browsers , no emails , no distractions : just me , my ideas , and the word processor .
Now that I ’ve acquired the Apple IIGS ADB keyboard you see in the picture , which is the most compact ( and robust ) of the smaller line of ADB keyboards manufactured by Apple , I connected it to my Macintosh Colour Classic , and I ’m using this beautiful compact Mac as a creative writing setup .
Its portable counterpart is the eMate 300 , which can be easily connected to the Colour Classic for text file transfers .
Another mobile solution I ’m working on is the clamshell iBook purchased on eBay a while ago , which I ’d like to keep as a OS 9 - only machine , to act as an efficient bridge between the ‘ old ’ and the ‘ new ’ world .
Since I started using this setup on a fairly regular basis , the creative drought seems over , thankfully .
The effect of returning to a Mac with a 10 - inch screen and System 7.1 is certainly interesting .
There ’s calm and much less chaos in the old System 7 ; that , and having a single application in the foreground is almost enough to inspire the creative process .
I have yet to decide which writing tool to use ; Word 5.1 , WordPerfect , an old version of Nisus Writer or WriteNow ?
They are all excellent candidates , each with its pros and cons , although I tend to prefer WordPerfect and WriteNow .
For the moment , I ’m taking notes with the good old SimpleText and familiarising with all of these word processors .
I ’ll probably stick with WriteNow — it has a negligible impact on the mere 6 MB RAM installed , and has a simple yet powerful interface .
Furthermore , I must admit that using a Mac that boots in 40 seconds is amazingly refreshing !
To keep up with a daily post I may just post a picture and let you discuss what you see .
The other afternoon I liked the contrast of the dark clouds against the sun hitting the buildings .

CHAMPAIGN , Ill . --
They were illiterate farmers , builders and servants , but Maya commoners found a way to record their own history - by burying it within their homes .
A new study of the objects embedded in the floors of homes occupied more than 1,000 years ago in central Belize begins to decode their story .
The study , from University of Illinois anthropology professor Lisa J. Lucero , appears in the Journal of Social Archaeology .
Maya in the Classic period ( A.D. 250-900 ) regularly " terminated " their homes , razing the walls , burning the floors and placing artifacts and ( sometimes ) human remains on top before burning them again .
Evidence suggests these rituals occurred every 40 or 50 years and likely marked important dates in the Maya calendar .
After termination , the family built a new home on the old foundation , using broken and whole vessels , colorful fragments , animal bones and rocks to mark important areas and to provide ballast for a new plaster floor .
Maya royals recorded their history in writing and in imagery carved on monuments , Lucero said .
" But the commoners had their own way of recording their own history , not only their history as a family but also their place in the cosmos , " she said .
" These things are buried , not to be seen , but it does n't mean people forgot about them , " she said .
" They are burying people in the exact same spot and removing bones from earlier ancestors to place them somewhere else , or removing pieces of them and keeping the pieces as mementos . "
This " de- animation " and reanimation of the home marked the passage of time and the cyclical nature of life , Lucero said .
Anthropologists have known for decades about such rituals , but Lucero chose to look more closely at how the arrangement , color and condition of the buried artifacts lent them their symbolic meaning .
She and her crew found about a dozen human remains in the two homes they excavated in a small Maya center called Saturday Creek , in central Belize .
These homes were occupied from about A.D. 450 to 1150 .
Burial in the home was common among the Maya , but only a few family members were entombed there , Lucero said .
No Maya cemeteries or other burial sites have been found to account for the rest of the dead .
There is no evidence that high status individuals were specifically selected for burial in the home .
It is more likely that family members who died on or near important dates were placed there during the termination and reanimation rituals , Lucero said .
The team found full or partial skeletons of men , women and children , with artifacts arranged around and even on top of the bodies .
Some bodies lay flat .
Others were in a sitting position , which may have signified a higher status , Lucero said .
Some of the bodies had had bones removed - most often the spine and the pelvis .
Black is the color of the west , death and the underworld , but Lucero never found black objects in or near a burial .
" The Maya believed in a cyclical way of living , " she said .
" So to their way of thinking , people do n't die as much as become ancestors . "
Colors , such as red , which represented the east , life and rebirth , were commonly used in burials .
Sometimes an unbroken red vessel was inverted over a skull or kneecap .
Red items were generally found on the east side of the body or group of artifacts .
Other artifacts - including groups of obsidian or chert rocks - represented the Maya belief in the nine levels of the underworld or the 13 levels of heaven .
Vessels were a very significant part of the dedication rites .
Lucero found bowls and jars that were in perfect condition when they were buried - manufactured specifically for the occasion , she said .
For termination rites , archaeologists also found used vessels with their rims broken off , jars lacking bases or necks , and vessels stacked in groups of three .
Some bowls were placed lip - to - lip , with stores of organic matter - a food offering perhaps - inside .
Other vessels were damaged with a " kill hole " drilled through their bottoms .
" Things that were used in life had to be de-animated , terminated , before they entered the next stage of their life history , " Lucero said .
Pieces were likely given away or placed in other sacred sites , such as caves , she said .
The rimless vessels were intriguing , Lucero said .
Other studies have found broken , but nearly complete vessels at temple sites , with the missing pieces located in nearby homes .
" Breaking off the rims is a lot of work , " Lucero said .
" Removing the rims may have been a way of de-animating them as well as giving a piece to somebody else . "
Perhaps the Maya revered the fragments of vessels or the bones of their ancestors in the same way that people today hold onto to , and cherish , religious relics , she said .
The new analysis supports her hypothesis that many of the elaborate rituals performed by Maya rulers and elites had a basis in the domestic rituals of their subjects .
She argued in her 2006 book , " Water and Ritual : The Rise and Fall of Classic Maya Rulers , " that the rulers reinforced community cohesion ( as well as their own status ) by adopting traditional domestic rituals and performing them on a grand scale .
" Nearly everything royal emerged or developed or evolved from domestic practices , " she said .
" So it makes sense to turn that around and use what we know about the rulers to interpret what we find in the commoners ' homes . "
Lucero has spent more than 20 years studying settlements and sacred sites that were important to the Maya in Belize , and works under the auspices of the Institute of Archaeology , which is part of the National Institute of Culture and History , Government of Belize .

About 30 minutes into every concert on the Black Eyed Peas ' current tour , band leader will .i.am performs a freestyle rap , riffing on text messages sent by audience members .
It 's a flashy solo turn for the musician who has steered the group since 1995 .
It 's also a moment in the spotlight for the tour 's primary sponsor , BlackBerry , which delivers the messages scrolling up two huge screens on the stage .
On its path from rootsy L.A. hip - hop troupe to pop juggernaut , the Black Eyed Peas have been escorted by a parade of corporate backers .
From Coors to Levi's , Honda to Apple , Verizon to Pepsi , brands have padded the group 's video budgets , underwritten its tours and billboarded band members in prominent places .
When Apple was preparing the 2003 launch of the iTunes store , The Peas ' " Hey Mama " became the first song associated with the iconic campaign 's dancing silhouettes , a point of pride for will .i.am , the band 's frontman .
For the musician , wooing potential corporate partners has become as integral to his job as the DJ sets he does on tour at after - parties sponsored by Bacardi .
Often will .i.am pitches the concepts himself using " decks " that sum up the Peas ' package , frequently in PowerPoint form .
" I consider us a brand .
A brand always has stylized decks , from colors to fonts .
Here 's our demographic .
Here 's the reach .
Here 's the potential .
Here 's how the consumer will benefit from the collaboration . "
If will .i.am was n't in music , " He'd be the best ad executive on Madison Avenue , " says Randy Phillips , president and CEO of the concert promoter AEG Live .
" I 've never seen anyone more astute at dealing with sponsors ' and companies ' needs and understanding their brands . "
He says he 's planning to have the rapper deliver a seminar to AEG 's global marketing team .

In politics , we often mistake trigger events for the cause of a problem .
Whenever some situation blows up in our faces and becomes a crisis , we look to the immediate past to see what “ caused ” it .
But our sense of cause is crippled because we see only the event that touched off the conflagration , not the series of events that piled up fuel and left matches scattered around , awaiting the inevitable foot .
The term critical mass applies to any situation where a number of causes have set it up to detonate .
The term means that enough of these causes are interacting that if events just continue on their present trajectory , the explosion becomes unavoidable .
When a political situation reaches critical mass , it will turn ugly unless someone intervenes and disrupts the many causes that await igniting .
In our modern time , the most prominent voice for the study of multiple causes reaching critical mass is chaos theory , which is usually explained in terms of “ the butterfly effect ” :
His simple model exhibits the phenomenon known as “ sensitive dependence on initial conditions . ”
This is sometimes referred to as the butterfly effect , e.g. a butterfly flapping its wings in South America can affect the weather in Central Park .
The question then arises â€ ” why does a set of completely deterministic equations exhibit this behavior ?
After all , scientists are often taught that small initial perturbations lead to small changes in behavior .
This was clearly not the case in Lorenz ’s model of the weather .
The answer lies in the nature of the equations ; they were nonlinear equations .
– Larry Bradley
Linear thinking arises from deconstruction .
In our media , popular politics and social groups , we like to express simple clear ideas that everyone in the room can understand .
But these are “ clear ” only in that they ’re dumbed down , so that one trigger event “ equals ” one result .
This kind of thinking works well in industrial production , or basic algebra .
We can study “ before ” and “ after ” states and conclude what causes what .
However , in complex real - world situations like politics , linear thinking is out of its depth .
Yet it is comforting to us , so we cling to it , and as a result become increasingly unaware of how our world works .
Natural forces elude us except in very simple , laboratory - like procedures .
We begin treating trigger events as causes and then become symbols .
We want the world to work like our minds , and treat it like a personality .
As a result , we get further away from reality itself .
In doing so , we bring our civilizations to critical mass , where without intervention they face a downward path .
Philosophers call this condition “ solipsism , ” meaning that we treat the world like it is part of our own minds .
It is the opposite of a scientific outlook where we observe the world , test our hypotheses of it , and try to figure out how it works .
Instead , we project ourselves onto it .
This reverses the process of natural selection , in which we adapt to the world .
We ’re forcing it to adapt to us , and for a short time at least , that works thanks to our technology .
On the long term , however , the forecast spells doom .
Civilizations die when they become disconnected from reality .
Any group of people can set up camp and decide to agree on a false reality , and because they only need to work together , they get away with it until they collide with nature .
If five friends decide that rain is an illusion , and build their society on a flood plain , they ’ll be just fine — until rainy season .
Deconstruction starts the process of leaving reality behind .
Instead of considering the whole of a situation , we consider the parts we can most easily grasp .
And soon we start forging those .
This process is inevitable because what started us down this path was backward thinking .
Instead of treating the world in a scientific manner , we approached it with a superstitious one .
We looked for a single cause when a situation of many causes needed to be understood .
We began going down this path long ago in the West , but we really picked up speed with “ The Enlightenment . ”
In a desire to get rid of Kings and Gods , we declared that all individuals were equal , so no hierarchy was needed .
This is backward thinking , a justification and not a reason why .
Instead of seeking a positive goal , we became reactionary , defending against things we saw as a threat to the individual .
This dissolves the social contract that holds a society together .
In order to uphold this fiction , we had to assume that every individual has the same faculty of judgment .
Of course , that is n’t so .
Most of us can’t balance a checkbook , figure out that a $ 40,000 SUV on a $ 30,000 salary is a dumb idea , or remember to not throw our garbage out the window as we drive down the freeway .
It ’s not that these people are morally bad ; they ’re just out of their depth when it comes to thinking ahead more than ten minutes into the future .
But freeing the individual from paying attention to reality caused a big problem .
Our society no longer had consensus about what was right and good .
As a result , we invented The Progressive Fallacy .
The Progressive Fallacy is the idea that as time passes , and our technology grows , society comes closer to a Utopian moral state of equality , diversity and freedom .
Unlike previous ideals , which held that life is a cyclic process of getting better at the same task , Progressive ideals hold that the task changes over time .
Conveniently , this fallacy relies on the deconstructed utilitarian sense of how people “ feel ” about their place in society .
It slowly distances us from causes and effects , and puts us into the spacy ground of emotions and symbols .
In the Western world , particularly since the Enlightenment , people view the human story as a linear tale with a beginning , middle and end .
We ’ve also projected a happy ending onto the tale , assuming that , generation by generation , the human lot improves and that , as Gray says , “ improvement in society is cumulative . ”
Gray ’s dour prognosis is that “ human knowledge tends to increase but humans do not become any more civilized as a result .
They remain prone to every kind of barbarism , and while the growth of knowledge allows them to improve their material conditions , it also increases the savagery of their conflicts . ”
If humanity simply is what humanity is , then no magic of technology , discovery of abundant resources or extraterrestrial intervention will free people from suffering and self - inflicted cruelty .
Gray prefers ancient , pre-Christian myths that , he says , explain the human condition without appealing to progressive notions .
In the Garden of Eden story , he says , “ there is no promise â€¦ of any return to a state of primordial innocence .
Once the fruit has been eaten , there ’s no going back . ”
Gray ’s advice at the end of Black Mass is to stop trying to change the world , especially through politics .
Modern life requires “ no grand vision of human advance , only the courage to cope with recurring evils . ”
He may be right , but his outlook is too bleak to win many converts .
Forbes
This book like others before it points out that our fond notions of “ progress ” hide a negative outlook on life .
We are no longer striving for a goal ; we ’re instead striving to avoid bad consequences defined by our dogma , not the science of adapting to reality .
As a result , we live in a schizophrenic mental state where we must pay attention to social appearance and the official story of how we ’re doing , but then also be aware of the real - world consequences of our actions outside the happy world of politics , advertising , and socialization .
Even more , our thinking has become inherently negative .
We strive for nothing .
Our entire outlook is defined by what we want to avoid , and we have created a hollow myth — that someday , humanity will stop having wars , fighting for supremacy and so on — which requires we neglect the brilliance of nature ’s design .
War , natural selection , and Darwinism may not appear to be ideal methods , but they work .
Progressive ideas do n’t work — they cause decline .
Progressive logic is the crux of our human failing .
When people behave morally badly , and their economies fragment , and they pollute their earth to the point that it ’s clear they live in denial of reality , they are thinking negatively .
They have separated themselves from any cause / effect analysis and are thinking in that world composed of personalities , memes , emotions and slogans in which cause and effect are the same thing .
Change a symbol , and that is the result you desired .
Reality is far away .
Back outside the tautological ghetto of the human mind , reality moves on .
We are one planet of billions .
Scientists think many others have the potential for life .
And when we observe nature , that makes sense .
No tree drops one seed — it drops ten thousand for every one it hopes to see survive into adulthood .
There is never only a single way to achieve a task .
This means that on these other life - supporting planets , there is most likely other life .
Each of these species will like us grow from primitive origins to a basic level of intelligence , technology and learning .
It will then face the same dilemma we do , a threshold of greatness : can it gain control of itself , or does it drown in its own wealth ?
Because it ’s easier for most individuals to space out and ignore problems , most societies follow this path of least resistance .
But like many apparently easy paths in life , it ’s a straight route to self - destruction and elimination from existence , or at least breeding back down to a monkey - level of intelligence .
You may think it ’s impossible for a society like this to fail .
After all , we have technology , lots of laws , a huge government , a giant media and millions of people watching .
But even the biggest thing , if it has no cohesion or ca n’t respond to changes in its environment , can collapse .
Does anyone believe that banks are “ too big to fail ” anymore ?
We do n’t think Rome , or the modern West , or even globalized humanity , is either !
Nothing I ’ve said in this article is in any way difficult .
In fact , it ’s all obvious .
However , the fact that it is obvious means that people are more likely to go into denial about it , and therefore need to be reminded of it .
It ’s too easy to hide in our big brains and push reality away .
But if you believe in humanity , as I do , you will trace our decline to its cause and fight against it , so that we do not perish at the threshold of greatness .

Even after the close call we just had with Wall Street practically taking down the entire world 's economy , Brit Hume thinks our economy is not recovering because of the " regulatory atmosphere " .
Apparently Hume thinks we need more of what took the system down as a means to fix it .
Hume :
You talk to bankers across the country , you talk to potential borrowers across the country , they ’re all saying the same thing , even now , the credit still remains for many of these potential borrowers a tremendous problem , credit is tight and that restricts their ability to invest and to grow and actually therefore to hire .
And that is part of what is holding this recovery back .
This economy needs to be unleashed .
What has happened over the past year or so is it ’s been leashed .
Williams :
How do you unleash ?
We ’ve had tax cuts through the Bush years .
President Obama extended the Bush tax cuts and you have in place a regulatory atmosphere that ’s trying to respond to the excesses of Wall Street …
Hume : I agree Juan .
Williams : … and those very bankers and you want to sit here and defend the bankers and corporate America after this terrible performance .
Hume : Juan let me just say this …
( crosstalk )
Williams :
He extended the Bush tax cuts this year this year .
Think of the logic .
Why did he do that ?
Because he knew that raising taxes is deflationary and recessionary .
Why does n’t he extend the Bush tax cuts again next year ?
Why are all the huge environmental regulations ...
Williams :
You ’re making a political argument …
Kristol : No. Williams : … on what ’s to come ( crosstalk ) .
President Obama has cut taxes .
Is that an argument ?
Hume :
He has not cut taxes in a way to be meaningful to the private sector , to business owners and so when you talk to them all , they ’re virtually unanimous on this point that the credit atmosphere , the tax atmosphere and the general regulatory atmosphere are all adverse to job creation and the growth of their businesses .
Now they ’re all trying Juan and they ’re all doing the best they can but when you see this , what you just said , defending corporate America … Juan … who do you think does the hiring in this country ?
He goes on to defend the bankers who were bailed out with our tax dollars by saying that they 're paying the money back , unlike the automotive companies that got bailed out .
I 'm not sure why he thinks the auto companies needing a bailout excuses what Wall Street did and they sure as hell have not paid all of the money back .
And as usual Hume and Kristol 's answer to everything is more tax cuts .
Naturally Forbes Magazine shares their feelings on raising corporate tax rates in this article -- What The Top U.S. Companies Pay In Taxes .
Our team member Jamie pointed to these two items in the article .
The most egregious example is General Electric .
Last year the conglomerate generated $ 10.3 billion in pretax income , but ended up owing nothing to Uncle Sam .
In fact , it recorded a tax benefit of $ 1.1 billion .
...
" Corporations are paying lower amounts of their profits in taxes now than in the past , " says Douglas Schackelford , who teaches tax law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
" Other countries have been lowering their rates , but not the U.S. "
All I 've seen from these big companies is a race to the bottom unless you force them to behave otherwise .
The Humes and Kristols of the world pretend they will behave if you just as Hume put it " unleash " them .
Unfortunately we 've already seen the results when that happens and it's why the economy is in the mess it is now .

Case preview :
In newest chapter in long - running water dispute , court will hear first - ever challenge to ruling by interstate river master Texas v. New Mexico is a new dispute in an old Supreme Court proceeding , first filed in 1974 but , until recently , dormant since the early 1990s .
The litigation involves the Pecos River , the waters of which are apportioned between New Mexico and Texas under the Pecos River Compact , approved by Congress in 1949 .
Earlier decisions in this case established key principles for litigation of interstate water disputes , helping define the court ’s approach to interpreting and enforcing water allocation compacts .
This latest installment — which will be argued on Oct. 5 , the first day of the court ’s 2020 - 21 term — figures to be far less consequential .
It is an accounting dispute over a one - time event that took place from 2014 to 2015 , involving temporary storage of floodwaters in a federal reservoir .
As a challenge to a decision by the court - appointed river master , the case is a procedural oddity , seemingly a first in the history of interstate water lawsuits that fall within the court ’s “ original jurisdiction . ”
The unique nature of the dispute makes it unlikely to set important precedent beyond the Pecos Basin .

“ What would Ruth do ? ” : A feminist pioneer on what Justice Ginsburg meant to her This tribute is the last in a series on the life and work of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
Gloria Steinem is a writer , lecturer , political activist and feminist organizer .
Because Ruth Bader Ginsburg and I are pretty much age peers , I think that I have some perspective on this extraordinary woman long before she became known to many of us as the Notorious RBG – and long before she ended the gender divide that had been the norm in Supreme Court rulings .
Ruth and I got to know each other decades ago when she was creating the Women ’s Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union .
From the onset , she was clear that reproductive freedom included the right to have , as well as not to have , children .
I say this now because much has been said about Ruth ’s support for women ’s right to a safe and legal abortion , but less about her belief that reproductive justice must also include the right to bear children .
At that time , some Black women were being sterilized by economic coercion or legal conditions of state aid .
Sterilization of poor Black women had become a practice so common that it was sometimes called “ a Mississippi appendectomy . ”
Yet white women often had to have two or more children , plus their husbands ’ written permission , before a doctor would perform a tubal ligation that freed them from the dangers of multiple pregnancies or artificial birth control .
What could be more clearly racist than that ?

Pennsylvania GOP leaders ask justices to block order on counting absentee ballots after Election Day ( updated ) Telling the Supreme Court that there is a “ very real possibility that the final presidential election results ” could rest on the outcome of voting in Pennsylvania , Republicans in the state asked the justices on Monday to block a ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that would require election officials to count absentee ballots received within three days after Election Day , Nov. 3 , even if they are not postmarked .
Without intervention from the justices , the Republican leaders in the state legislature warned , the Pennsylvania court ’s ruling “ could destroy the American public ’s confidence in the election system as a whole . ”

October Term 2020 and the specter of ( a lot of ) mootness Recent discussions of the Supreme Court ’s upcoming term have understandably focused on the implications of the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — and the seemingly inevitable confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to succeed her .
At least some of that commentary , in turn , has raised the possibility of the court being called upon to potentially resolve the presidential election , or at least high - profile cases relating to it .
But the election looms over the upcoming term in at least one other ( less sensational ) respect : the number of cases that could potentially be mooted before they are decided , especially if there ’s a change in administrations come January 2021 .
Indeed , although mootness is always a possibility during terms featuring presidential transitions , there are more disputes with potential mootness problems in the pipeline for the upcoming term than was true four years ago ( when no granted cases were mooted by the shift in administrations ) .
Thus , with the justices set to add cases to their docket in the coming weeks , including after Tuesday ’s long conference , one possibility is for the court to be strategic not just in which cases it grants and when , but in how it schedules arguments in these cases — perhaps setting some of the potentially moot - able disputes for arguments in March and April rather than January and February .
At the very least , the specter of mootness helps to underscore how something as mundane as when a case is scheduled for argument can sometimes have substantive implications .

Dear Cecil :
What is the deal with cousins marrying each other ?
In most states it 's against the law .
Yet where I am working , in a West African francophone country , there is a saying , " Cousins are made for cousins . "
Is this practice really genetically unsound , or is that just an American old wives ' tale ?
Jay Davidson , Peace Corps volunteer , Mauritania
Cecil replies :
Among the many things Americans just know , without ever having thought about it , is that if first cousins marry , their children will be drooling half - wits .
The handful who wonder if there ’s any logic to this belief probably think : Royal inbreeding .
Prince Charles .
Case closed .
As recent events have shown , however , a lot of things we Yanks just know are n’t so .
The supposed evils of cousin marriage may not be the first one that comes to mind , but it ’s definitely on the list .
In his dissection of the issue , Forbidden Relatives : The American Myth of Cousin Marriage ( 1996 ) , anthropologist Martin Ottenheimer points out the following little - known facts — little - known , that is , here in the U.S. :
The U.S. is virtually alone among developed nations in outlawing marriage among first cousins .
European countries have no such prohibition .
In some cultures , particularly Islamic ones , first - cousin marriage is encouraged .
Even in the U.S. laws forbidding the practice are far from universal .
First - cousin marriage is currently illegal or restricted in 31 states .
( Some states allow it if there ’s no chance of procreation — interesting in light of conservative opposition to gay marriage on the grounds that the institution ’s function is to produce children . )
It ’s legal in the rest — and no , Kentucky and West Virginia are n’t among the permissive ones .
Try California and New York .
First - cousin marriage is n’t a surefire recipe for congenital defects .
True , marriage among close kin can increase the chance of pathological recessive genes meeting up in some unlucky individual , with dire consequences .
The problem is n’t cousin marriage per se , however , but rather how many such genes are floating around in the family pool .
If the pool ’s pretty clean , the likelihood of genetic defects resulting from cousin marriage is low .
A recent review ( Bennett et al , Journal of Genetic Counseling , 2002 ) says that , on average , offspring of first - cousin unions have a 2 to 3 percent greater risk of birth defects than the general population , and a little over 4 percent greater risk of early death .
While those margins are n’t trivial , genetic testing and counseling can minimize the danger .
An argument can be made that marriages of first cousins descended from strong stock can produce exceptional children .
Charles Darwin , for example , married his first cousin Emma , which was n’t at all unusual in their prominent and successful family — their common grandparents were cousins too .
Three of Charles and Emma ’s ten kids died in childhood , it ’s true , but that was standard for Victorian England ; the others went on to productive and in some cases distinguished careers .
All kidding aside , the formerly high incidence of congenital defects , specifically hemophilia , among European royal families is n’t the classic demonstration of the perils of inbreeding that everybody thinks it is .
The short explanation is that hemophilia is an X - chromosome - related characteristic , transmitted only through the female line .
The children of royal female carriers would have been at risk no matter whom their mothers had married .
Why are Americans and their legal system so phobic about first - cousin marriage while Europeans are n’t ?
Ottenheimer blames several factors .
First , bad research in the 19th century greatly exaggerated the dangers of imbecility , blindness , etc , among children of close kin .
This research was eventually discredited in Europe , but Americans and their state legislators never got the word .
Second , cousin marriage in the U.S. was considered a sign of barbarism ( probable translation : hillbillies did it ) .
In Europe , on the other hand , particularly in Mediterranean cultures , cousin marriage had a long and reasonably respectable history , although it ’s rare today .
Finally , European deep thinkers contended that certain forms of cousin marriage increased social cohesion .
No such positive arguments were advanced in the States .
Let me emphasize we ’re talking strictly about cousin marriage here .
The incest taboo regarding parent - child and sibling unions is still strong in Europe and most other places .
Setting aside the issue of exploitation where minor children are concerned , such unions have a much higher risk of “ adverse medical outcome ” — 7 to 31 percent , according to Bennett et al .
As for cousin marriage — admit it , you admire me for keeping the word “ kissin ' ” out of this discussion —
Ottenheimer thinks U.S. laws against it ought to be repealed .
I ’m not seeing it : Jerry Lee Lewis got a buttload of flak for marrying his first cousin once removed in 1957 , and the uproar over gay marriage suggests that rewriting the rules about whom one may properly wed is likely to be a tough sell now .
Still , the issue reminds us of the importance of asking , when confronted with some instance of conventional wisdom : Says who ?

March 22 , 2010 --
The free , sovereign and independent homeland of our dreams will only come true if we radicalise the process and speed up the transition to socialism ” , Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez wrote in his March 14 weekly column “ Chavez Lines ” .
The Venezuelan government has launched a number of initiatives in recent weeks aimed to tackle threats to the revolutionary process — including from elements within the pro-Chavez camp that seek to undermine plans to deepen the revolution .
Central to this are new measures aimed at speeding up the transfer of power to organised communities .
Chavez wrote in his February 21 column : “ The time has come for communities to assume the powers of state , which will lead administratively to the total transformation of the Venezuelan state and socially to the real exercise of sovereignty by society through communal powers . ”
Participatory democracy
The previous day , Chavez announced the creation of the federal government council in front of thousands of armed peasants that are part of the newly created peasant battalions in the Bolivarian militia .
As well as the vice president , government ministers , state governors and mayors , the council includes representatives of communal councils , communes and other representatives directly elected by the people .
The communal councils are grassroots bodies that bring together existing community organisations that have sprung up in Venezuela ’s poor neighbourhood around issues such as access to health , education , water and electricity .
The councils encompass 200-400 families in urban areas and 20 - 50 families in rural areas .
Decisions on which problems to prioritise and how to tackle them are made in citizen assemblies open to the entire community .
Funding for the councils comes from the government , but a strong emphasis is placed on relying on local cooperatives , volunteer labour and local expertise to bypass private contractors and empower the community .
Communes bring together various local communal councils and other social organisations in order to tackle problems on a larger scale .
There are 187 communes are in the process of being created nationally .
Communes are being encouraged to play a direct economic role , such as creating cooperatives , taking over idle factories to be reopened under worker - community control , and setting up communal markets to sell produces from other communes .
The federal government council brings together representatives of the old state structures with the new , emerging communal state .
The council aims to help transfer various powers now held by the national government , state governorships and mayoralties to these emerging organs of peoples ’ power .
Such organs include workers ’ and peasants ’ councils , which will also be represented on the council .
Workers ’ control
There are also indications the government is moving to transfer control over the running of important state industries to their workers .
One example is Plan Socialist Guayana , which involves tens of thousands of workers in the industrial complex in Bolivar state .
Workers , backed by Chavez , have been discussing , and in some cases implementing , a radical transformation in the running of local aluminum , iron ore , steel and mining companies .
There are also important moves in the electrical sector , which has been plagued with problems .
Hydroelectric dams that are at critically low levels due to ongoing droughts generate some 70 % of Venezuela ’s electricity .
The sector also suffers from years of under - investment by pre-Chavez governments that were preparing to privatise the state - owned industry .
Declaring a state of emergency in the electrical sector , Chavez has called on the workers to actively participate in management .
This has long been a demand of the workers themselves , who finally won this year an important 15 - month - long battle against state management for a new collective contract .
The new contract not only equalises pay and conditions across the electricity sector ( as part of integrating newly nationalised companies with the pre-existing state industry ) , it also enshrines worker and community participation in management .
Since then , the Federation of Electrical Workers ( Fetraelec ) and new electricity minister Ali Araque Rodriguez have been removing managers who have operated against the interests of the workers and sabotaged the industry .
In some places , workers have begun to take control over local affiliates of Corpoelec , the national state - owned power company .
Chavez also named Raul Arocha as president of CADAFE , a key component of Corpoelec .
Arocha is an engineer who was elected by workers as manager of the Merida zone of CADAFE and helped develop workers ’ participation there .
Fetraelec proposed Arocha ’s appointment due to his proven commitment to promoting worker participation .
Fetraelec is organising nation - wide workers ’ assemblies to develop a plan for how workers can run the sector .
The assemblies will culminate with a mass meeting with Chavez where workers will present their proposals to restructure Corpoelec .
In a March 18 press conference with Fetraelec leaders , Jaua said : “ Chavez wants the workers to convert themselves in protagonist subject ... via the creation of socialist companies , with the decisive and active participation of the workers . ”
In response to allegations by the right - wing opposition that Chavez is seeking to concentrate power in his own hands , Vice - President Elias Juau told the February 20 gathering of armed peasants : “ We did not come here to concentrate power but rather to dismantle the national oligarchy .
“ For us , the only way to avoid the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of the oligarchy is to return power to the people . ”
This encroachment on the economic and political power of local and Western capitalist interests has provoked a violent reaction .
One example is the response of large landowners to the government ’s land reform program , in which 2.5 million hectares have been redistributed to poor peasants since 2001 .
In that time , more than 250 peasant leaders have been killed at the hands of paramilitaries hired by large landowners .
In response to this violence , and as part of preparing for a potential foreign military attack , peasant battalions of the Bolivarian militia have been formed this year .
Chavez has also argued for the creation of worker battalions organised in factories .
He said : “ The Bolivarian Militia , as well as community councils , are expressions of the new communal state , an integral part of the new structure of the communal power we are building . ”
A new state
Chavez said creating a new state was needed “ to demolish the old perverse vestiges and new threats of bueaucratism ” .
He said , “ the best and most radically democratic of the options for defeating bureaucracy and corruption is the construction of a communal state ” .
A recent example of government moves to tackle corruption was the arrest of a number of bankers .
Many of the arrested claimed to support the revolutionary process .
But via deals signed with government ministries and other state institutions , they had created a network of corruption with state funds .
More than 30 bankers face charges .
The state intervened into eight banks ( of which six are now run by the state ) and several dozen companies owned by the bankers were nationalised .
Reformist and corrupt practices within state companies and the government have set back past attempts to move towards workers ’ control .
The push by electricity workers between 2004 and 2006 for workers ’ participation in management was rolled back by reformist sectors within the company and the government .
The workers are confronting some of these same forces in the renewed battle for workers ’ control .
In Guayana , aluminum workers have denounced a number of attempts by management , and national and state officials , to sabotage workers ’ participation — which has increased discontent and disillusionment among workers toward the government .
One recent example is a contract signed by management to sell semi-finished materials to the multinational Glencore for the next six years , with no consultation with the workers .
Such corrupt deals with multinationals remove the possibility of workers deciding where production should be geared .
Venezuela is an underdeveloped nation heavily reliant on its oil industry .
One of the key aims of the revolution is to overcome this through national development .
Production for foreign markets on behalf of multinationals undermines this goal .
It contradicts Chavez ’s January 24 announcement that all state firms should hand their products to a state entity to distribute them according to the needs of the people at cheaper prices .
The aluminum workers are demanding such contracts be rescinded .
Revolution , not reform
On February 20 , Chavez again called on the people to continue to “ prepare themselves for the transference and redistribution of political , economic , social and military power ” .
Chavez said on March 5 : “ We are not here to carry out a reform , no !
“ This is a revolution , and if we are not clear about what we are dealing with , we could end up carrying out a simple reform so that nothing changes in the end . ”
Chavez quoted Polish - born revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg ’s famous 1900 pamphlet Reform or Revolution : “ Only when the great mass of workers take the keen and dependable weapons of scientific socialism in their own hands , will all the petty - bourgeois inclinations , all the opportunistic currents , come to naught . ”
Chavez argued that ideological weakness and ties to business interests where behind the defection in February by Lara governor Henri Falcon , who left the Chavez - led United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) to join the Homeland For All ( PPT ) party .
On March 13 , Chavez said : “ He could n’t take it any more because he is not a real revolutionary ... A special fibre is required in order to confront the oligarchy . ”
He said the “ regional bourgeoisie ” surrounded Falcon .
Chavez urged the pre-candidates in the internal PSUV elections to determine the candidates for September national elections to strengthen themselves ideologically by reading Karl Marx , Rosa Luxemburg and Che Guevara .
“ We have a clear target for the next elections : an overwhelming triumph so that the National Assembly continues being a space to strengthen and deepen the socialist dynamic . ”
Rather than simply being a question of the number of PSUV candidates elected , Chavez said , “ what we are dealing with is a qualitative revolutionary challenge ” .
“ If we want that the parliament to dismantle the old capitalist state and open the doors to the socialist state , we have to increase our revolutionary conscience and our real socialist praxis [ practice ] . ”
Chavez said the aim was moving beyond simple representation to a situation where the people themselves will govern .
“ This is about legislating in accordance with the socialist praxis and obeying the people .
Those who do not understand it must choose another path . ”

Venezuela : revolution in the electricity industry
By Federico Fuentes
March 26 , 2010 -- Correo del Orinoco International --
Workers in the electrical sector are set to embark on nationwide consultation process to elaborate strategic and immediate solutions for the electricity crisis .
Alongside proposals for improving the sector and energy - saving measures , discussions will focus on introducing workers ' participation in the management of the state - owned electricity company , Corpoelec .
In February , Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez declared a national state of emergency in the electrical sector .
The drastic situation facing this sector , which has led to a series of rationing programs across the country , is the result of various factors .
Prior to Chavez 's election in 1998 , previous neoliberal governments had neglected the electricity sector in order to pave the way for its privatisation .
In the early 1990s , pro-capitalist governments succeeded in privatising the electricity companies that serviced Caracas and the northeastern island state of Nueva Esparta .
But , in 1999 , a bill to privatise a further chunk of the 14 state - owned electricity companies was halted just in time , when Chavez came to power .
Since then , the government has moved to renationalise those companies that were privatised and has unified them into one single company , Corpoelec .
More consumption , more investment
The Chavez government has also increased funding and investment in the electricity sector , attempting to keep up with the huge rise in electricity consumption resulting from government housing and aid for low - income communities and industrial development projects .
While the government has been able to increase electricity supply by 4623 megawatts between 1999 - 09 ( compared to 2945 MW installed in the 10 years prior to Chavez ) , electricity demand has increased by more than 5000 MW , from around 12,000 to 17,337 MW by the end of 2009 .
Extremely high consumption patterns have converted Venezuela into the largest consumer per capita of energy in the continent , higher even than more industrialised countries such as Brazil and Argentina .
These problems have been compounded in recent months , as climate change - induced droughts have had a severe impact , with water levels dropping sharply in the Guri hydroelectric dam , which provides more than 70 % of Venezuela 's electricity .
Minister for electricity Ali Rodriguez Araque stated on March 18 that it was vital for Venezuelans " to optimise their use of electricity and combat waste " in order to confront the current emergency .
Angel Navas , president of the Federation of Electrical Workers , Fetraelec , commented that the " rationing program is aimed at combating a model of consumption that is unsustainable and unviable .
That is why it is a problem for all the population , and all the industries . "
These statements were made at a press conference , alongside vice president Elias Jaua and other leaders of Fetraelec late last week .
Raising consciousness on energy conservation
Workers in the electrical sector have been leading the way in an awareness - raising campaign to encourage people to save on electricity .
Part of the conservation program includes free distribution of energy - saving light bulbs in communities across the nation .
So far , more than 6 million of these bulbs have been installed throughout the nation .
Industry workers have also been monitoring state institutions to ensure that they comply with new work hours established to reduce energy consumption in the public sector .
According to vice - president Jaua , " President Hugo Chavez wants workers to be the guarantors of a trustworthy electrical sector " , ratifying his confidence in the workers who have energetically responded to the declaration of a national electricity emergency .
" President Chavez hopes workers will become key actors providing Venezuela with a trustworthy , lasting , and permanent electrical system for the people , through the construction of socialist companies , with a decisive and active participation of the workers " , said Jaua .
Historic workers ' participation
A series of workers ' assemblies and meetings were organised across the country , in order to collect proposals from the workers regarding structural changes to the company , as well as ideas for tackling the current emergency .
These proposals will be complied and categorised before being discussed in round - tables when hundreds of workers from across the country gather in Caracas between April 5 - 7 , and final proposals are presented to Chavez in a public event .
Navas described the proposals to move toward workers ' control as a " historic event " .
FETRAELEC has long been campaigning for workers ' participation as a solution to the problems in the electrical sector , and recently signed a new contract that not only equalises pay and conditions across the country as a step towards further unifying the sector , but also includes a clause relating to workers ' participation in management .
In 2001 , FETRAELEC also signed a collective contract with CADAFE , one of the main components of Corpoelec , which had as its first clause the right of workers to participate in managing the industry .
At the end of 2002 , managers in the electricity sectors attempted to join their counterparts in the state oil company PDVSA by shutting down strategic industries in order to economically strangle and sabotage the country to bring down the Chavez government .
Workers played a key role in defeating the efforts led by managers , eventually recuperating the industries and re-balancing Venezuela 's economy .
Out of this struggle , workers began to organise committees across the industry to implement their collective contract .
However , they encountered fierce resistance from company managers and sections of the government who feared losing power and privileges .
By 2005 , the experience of workers ' participation had been rolled back across the country , with the exception of the Merida branch of CADAFE , where workers had elected Raul Arocha as local manager .
Arocha came from the grassroots workers ' struggle and represented their interests .
The strong relationship that existed between the workers , union and management meant the process was able to continue and achieve record results in regard to service provision and intakes .
As part of an important sign of the government 's intention to once again promote workers ' control of the industry , President Chavez designated Raul Arocha as president of CADAFE at the beginning of March 2010 .
Zapatero contemplates the fiscal abyss
ON A small plot of land near Candeleda , in Ávila province , Antonio de la Cruz is planting tobacco .
It is years since he grew anything .
During Spain 's decade - long boom , he worked on construction sites , which paid better .
But building has ground to a halt .
“ I 've got to do something , ” he says .
He is lucky : few of Spain 's 4.3 m unemployed ( almost 20 % of the workforce ) have bits of land to plough .
A morale - boosting advertising campaign , backed by 18 large banks and companies , tells glum Spaniards that their problems can be fixed “ between us all ” .
The opposition People 's Party disagrees .
This has to be fixed by whoever broke it , says its spokesman , Esteban González Pons .
He means that the Socialist prime minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , should do the fixing — and that he is failing .
The list of things that need repair is extensive .
Spain 's structural faults were long hidden by a housing bubble and have been glaringly exposed now that it has burst .
From unemployment and low productivity growth , and from troubled savings banks to creaky public finances , the problems are piling up .
With the government unwilling to apply radical surgery , there are fears that Spain will fall further behind its neighbours .
“ The risk is that we will have a lost decade , like Portugal or Japan , ” says Lorenzo Bernaldo de Quirós , an economist at Freemarket International Consulting in Madrid .
Unemployment tops most people 's worries .
Faster growth is needed to bring it down .
Yet Spain has been in recession for seven quarters ; the government expects GDP to shrink again this year ; and the IMF forecasts growth of less than 1 % in 2011 .
The public finances must also be fixed .
Last year 's deficit ballooned to over 11 % of GDP .
In January Elena Salgado , the finance minister , produced an outline of austerity measures that calmed market fears about Spanish debt .
But two months later the plan still lacks detail — and has an obvious flaw .
An optimistic Ms Salgado predicted growth of 3 % in both 2012 and 2013 , bringing added revenues to cut the deficit .
Spain 's European commissioner , Joaquín Almunia , has warned against the sin of over - optimism .
Growth will not go over 2 % until 2014 , says Ángel Laborda , an economist at FUNCAS , the savings banks ' foundation .
He reckons that more tax rises and spending cuts are inevitable if the government is to hit its 3 % deficit target by 2013 .
Ms Salgado is already raising value - added tax , with the top rate going from 16 % to 18 % in July .
Mr Zapatero says this will finance the unemployed .
“ We can pay unemployment benefits to half a million people , ” he said in a television interview .
Yet higher taxes will also dampen consumer spending , sending growth lower still .
Deeper reforms to Spain 's economy look unlikely .
The Bank of Spain 's governor , Miguel Ángel Fernández Ordóñez , is calling for reform of a rigid labour market that makes most employees too costly to fire but condemns a third of workers to unstable , unprotected temporary jobs .
Yet the government has repeatedly delayed pension and labour reforms .
Mr Zapatero 's great goal is to conserve social peace .
That means keeping trade unions happy , even if reforms ( and growth ) have to wait .
Some detect a whiff of cowardice .
Mr Zapatero 's determination to avoid general strikes is proof that he will never take a difficult decision , says Artur Mas , head of the Catalan Convergence and Union coalition .
And because broad agreements on public - spending cuts lack detail , they also lack urgency .
A recent austerity deal with regional governments , responsible for over a third of Spain 's public spending , allows for two more months of haggling .
In the meantime Spain 's financial sector is jibbing at reform plans .
Some cajas ( savings banks ) are heavily exposed to construction and housing loans .
Mr Ordóñez says a third of the 45 cajas need to disappear ( by being absorbed by others ) .
A €99 billion ( $ 132 billion ) rescue fund is producing only limited consolidation so far , with perhaps seven Catalan cajas merging into two .
Local politicians , who have a big say in their cajas , do not want to lose power .
The Bank of Spain must act urgently , says Luis Garicano of the London School of Economics .
The system cannot improve so long as doomed entities are kept alive , says Miguel Martín , president of the Spanish Banking Association .
The delay in sorting out the cajas adds to the sense of drift .
Most Spaniards do not see the economy improving any time soon .
Faith in the political class is at rock bottom .
The Spanish now rate politicians as a bigger problem than their old bugbear , terrorism .
Mr Zapatero's Socialists are trailing in the polls — but an election is not due for two more years .
The human body 's immune system can quickly track down and kill cells that do n't belong .
Take certain kinds of bacteria : molecules on their surfaces flag them as foreign invaders , alerting the body 's defenders to the breach and drawing a full - fledged attack on anything waving that molecular flag .
But sometimes the system mistakenly attacks the body 's own cells .
The result is autoimmune disease , such as type 1 diabetes , in which the insulin - producing beta cells of the pancreas are attacked and destroyed by T cells .
Scientists have struggled to find ways to treat autoimmune disease without compromising overall immunity .
Therapies that suppress the immune system carry the risk of letting infections and even tumors go unchecked .
But researchers in Canada have found a way to prevent type 1 diabetes in mice by doing just the opposite — vaccinating to boost the immune system .
The approach , published April 8 in Immunity , exploits the immune system 's built - in safety mechanism — a group of regulatory T cells whose job is to squelch overactive immune responses .
" Essentially , there is an internal tug - of - war between aggressive T cells that want to cause [ an autoimmune response ] and weaker T cells that want to stop it from occurring , " says study senior author Pere Santamaria from the Julia McFarlane Diabetes Research Center at the University of Calgary in Alberta .
Although they have seemingly opposite effects , these different classes of T cells are " musicians in the same orchestra , " Santamaria explains .
And they take directions from the same conductor — the antigen - presenting cell ( APC ) .
APCs are specialized white blood cells that grab tiny bits of protein off the surfaces of other cells ( like invaders or , in the case of diabetes , beta cells ) , chop them into pieces ( antigens ) and present them to T cells to instigate the immune response .
" T cells have to be fed , " Santamaria says .
" If there is no antigen - presenting cell , there is no immune response . "
When the aggressive , autoimmune disease - causing T cells are presented with antigens from dying beta cells , they keep attacking and killing the beta cells .
But when the weak T cells that want to stop the disease are presented with those same antigens , they kill the APC .
" A single weak T cell can blunt the problem by killing the orchestra leader , " Santamaria says .
And unlike aggressive T cells that die shortly after killing their targets , weak T cells proliferate .
" They become long - living cells that attempt to regulate the disease , " Santamaria says .
Santamaria designed a " vaccine " to boost the activity of the weak T cells .
He used nanoparticles — spheres thousands of times smaller than a single cell — that were coated with beta cell antigens .
In doing so , he created an APC doppelganger that could repeatedly activate the weak T cells , causing them to proliferate and kill the real APCs .
The nanoparticles shield the antigens from degradation , meaning they stay in the system much longer , so they can be delivered at fewer intervals and at lower doses .
The nanovaccine prevented diabetes in a prediabetic mouse model and restored normal blood sugar levels in diabetic mice .
Santamaria hopes to translate his exciting finding into human clinical trials .
" We know what we want the compound to look like for use in humans — it 's not a pie in the sky , " he says .
" But launching a clinical trial is not a trivial task .
It requires that we do our homework properly . "
Over 23 million people in the U.S. have diabetes , according to the most recent report jointly produced by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) and the American Diabetes Association , although only 5 to 10 percent of those cases are thought to be autoimmune ( type 1 diabetes ) .
Type 1 diabetics have to carefully monitor their blood glucose levels and routinely administer insulin to keep them down .
They have a heightened risk for kidney failure , heart and eye problems , and nerve disease .
Autoimmune disease affects up to 23.5 million Americans , according to the NIH , and it is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in female children and women in all age groups up to 64 years .
Santamaria plans to test his approach in models of other autoimmune diseases , such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis .
" We 're trying to extend this paradigm to see if it applies to other autoimmune disorders , as well .
We think it will but that remains to be seen .
That ’s our hope and dream . "

OKLAHOMA CITY -- Back when the Thunder were 3 - 29 last season , the notion of the playoffs coming to Oklahoma City any time soon was unimaginable .
Coach Scott Brooks helped the Thunder win 27 more games this season than they did a year ago .
Andrew D. Bernstein / NBAE
But it was that same miserable stretch that made general manager Sam Presti confident that coach Scott Brooks was the right man to lead his team into the future .
While Oklahoma City struggled to the worst start in the NBA , Presti was impressed by the way Brooks stayed the course and never tried to force immediate changes in hopes of making the Thunder better .
He now has taken the youngest roster in the league and turned the team into a 50 - game winner and a playoff team just one season after the horrendous start .
For that best - in - the - NBA turnaround , Brooks was recognized Wednesday as the NBA 's coach of the year .
He received 71 of 123 first - place votes and 480 points to finish ahead of Milwaukee 's Scott Skiles ( 26 first - place votes , 313 points ) and Portland 's Nate McMillan ( 9 , 107 ) .
" He 's someone that I think is incredibly consistent as a person .
He is unaffected through adversities and also through successes , and I think that 's an important quality we want to have as we move forward , " Presti said .
Even as he was receiving a statue of Red Auerbach , Brooks faced another daunting turnaround : an 0 - 2 deficit in the Thunder 's best - of - seven series against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers , led by Kobe Bryant and coach Phil Jackson .

Microsoft's Patrick Dengler , a senior program manager on the Internet Explorer team , revealed this week that Microsoft is joining the W3C's Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG ) working group .
In a post on the official IE blog , Dengler says that Microsoft hopes to collaborate on future versions of the SVG standard .
This move reflects Microsoft 's growing involvement in the industry - wide effort to advance open Web standards .
Internet Explorer has a notoriously bad track record on standards compliance and interoperability , but Microsoft is gradually remedying these issues and has been attempting to engage more productively with the standards community .
The company took a big step last year when it began participating in the HTML 5 editing process and expressed support for HTML 5 audio and video elements .
Joining the SVG working group is another big step forward — one that will likely be welcomed by Web developers .
Microsoft 's browser supports its own incompatible XML - based graphics format called the Vector Markup Language ( VML ) , a vestigial precursor to SVG .
Web applications that use complex vector graphics typically have specialized code paths for generating VML for Internet Explorer users while using SVG for everyone else .
This significantly increases the complexity of using vector graphics in Web applications and makes SVG impractical to use in many cases .
If Microsoft were to implement native support for SVG in Internet Explorer , it would eliminate those challenges and enable ubiquitous adoption of SVG .
It 's important to note , however , that Microsoft has not yet committed to implementing SVG — though that seems like a likely outcome .
The company 's announcement on Tuesday indicates only that it plans to participate in ongoing efforts to refine the SVG standard .
" As a part of Microsoft 's continued commitment to interoperability and standards support , yesterday we submitted our request to join the Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG ) Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) .
We 're excited to take part in ensuring future versions of the SVG spec will meet the needs of developers and end users , " wrote Dengler .
" We recognize that vector graphics are an important component of the next generation Web platform . "
Microsoft 's Silverlight framework for rich Internet applications ( RIA ) supplies its own mechanisms for browser - embedded multimedia and vector graphics , but the SVG standard and the HTML5 audio and video elements provide compelling vendor - neutral solutions that are widely supported in other browsers .
Microsoft 's growing support for these standards could potentially be a sign that the company is softening its Silverlight strategy and positioning its proprietary plugin as a complement to Web standards rather than a competitor .
Microsoft 's evolving position on Web standards is undoubtedly influenced by pressure from the rapidly growing popularity of Firefox and Chrome .
Emerging standards like HTML5 are gaining broad traction and could start to see significant adoption in next - generation Web applications .
If this phenomenon leads to a trend of popular Web services blocking Internet Explorer users or giving them a severely degraded experience — much like what Google has done with Wave — it could rapidly degrade Microsoft 's browser marketshare by giving users a bigger incentive to switch to alternatives .
It seems like Microsoft has realized that it risks losing its relevance in the browser market if it does n't strengthen its support for open standards .
That ’s right , kids – astronauts pee too !
Except they have to pee in some sort of space - porta - potty that probably does n’t smell as bad as the ones at outdoor music festivals .
Yuck .
What you see above is the plume of a huge water and urine dump from shuttle Discovery this last week .
The shuttle , while docked with the International Space Station , sprayed about 150 pounds of waste water and pee-pee out into space on September 10 – as you can assume , independent shuttle trackers and other geeks flipped the $ # % ^ out .
“ IS THE SHUTTLE ON FIRE ?!
IS IT VENTING SOMETHING ? ”
Nope .
Just pee .
Here ’s another picture from Space Weather ( September 10 archive ) , which has some details on the extraurine activity .
BWAHA !
From the Space Weather website :
Sky watchers across North America witnessed a strange event on Wednesday night .
As space shuttle Discovery glided silently overhead , the orbiter sprouted a flamboyant comet - like tail .
“ The shuttle put on a major light show , ” says Perry .
In Madison , Wisconsin , photographer Abe Megahed witnessed a similar display : “ The shuttle was sporting a massive curved plume .
What could it be ?
Something venting ?
Reaction Control System thrusters ?
A massive , record - breaking urine dump ? ” Stop laughing .
Shuttle pilot Kevin Ford was indeed scheduled to carry out a number of “ waste water ” dumps over a several hour period around the time of these observations .
Pristine water supplies and condensates were also dumped overboard in preparation for landing on Thursday , Sept. 10th .
Thanks , Space.com !
Editor 's note : Follow Steven Stanton 's transition to a woman on " Her Name was Steven " on CNN Saturday 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET
( CNN ) -- Susan Stanton does n't seem much different than any other woman :
She struggles with her weight , she tries to balance her career with being a parent , and she worries about her teenage son who is just learning to drive .
But Stanton has been a woman for only about two years .
In 2007 , Largo , Florida , City Manager Steven Stanton , announced he planned to become a woman .
Stanton -- who knew very little about the transgender community -- practically became the poster child for the transgender rights movement .
Today , her name is linked more closely with budget concerns in Lake Worth , Florida .
That relative anonymity has allowed Stanton to finally achieve her goals : to live her life as a woman , resume her career as a city manager , and continue to raise her son .
Stanton on " Larry King Live " : I always knew
Stanton 's transition from man to woman is intimately chronicled in the CNN documentary , " Her Name was Steven , " which airs this Saturday at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET .
Stanton agreed to participate in the documentary to " put a human face on [ something ] people still have a profound misunderstanding of , " she says .
Are you transgendered ?
Share your message
Stanton 's 2007 announcement came as a shock to the city of Largo , Florida , who had known Steven Stanton as their city manager for 14 years .
The city manager was promptly terminated and Stanton 's marriage ended .
After transitioning to Susan , she became a pariah in the transgender community for her wavering position on whether all transgender people should be federally protected , as well as her decision not to sue the city of Largo for her termination .
But her relationship with her son , Travis , never wavered .
Travis ' acceptance of his father is a central part of the CNN documentary .
Read Travis ' essay about his father
The most stinging criticism for Stanton is that the gender transition would harm Travis .
" They perceive [ that ] when you go through this process , you 're going to become some sort of monster , " she said .
" This story clearly documents the love of a child to a dad because the dad never changed -- maybe the outside changes . "
Stanton underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2008 .
Travis still calls Stanton " Dad , " which Stanton says does not bother her , even when Travis says it in front of other people .
" I 'm his dad , I 'll always be his dad , " she says .
" I 'm not his mom . "
Starting over
It has been nearly a year since Stanton was hired as Lake Worth 's city manager .
She says her main concern today is getting Lake Worth through the difficult economic challenges that nearly every small U.S. city is facing .
She has the unique position of knowing what it 's like to serve as a city manager as both a man and a woman .
" You do n't realize how difficult it is to lead people as a woman because you do n't get the deference as a woman , " Stanton says .
" As a guy , when I 'm talking , people would stop .
But now , sometimes I find myself saying , ' Excuse me , stop interrupting me . ' "
Looking back
Like many transgender people , Stanton struggled with serious depression and suicidal thoughts during her transition .
The loss of her job and her marriage were the two most difficult side effects of the process .
" I did not want to leave angry at my city , the person who wound up divorcing me and the people who wound up getting off my train , " she said .
She credits her faith with helping her not internalize anger after losing so much during the transition process .
" So many people who go through this process , they do n't do that , " she said .
" And they 're justified in their emotion , but it becomes incapacitating . "
Stanton speaks fondly of both the city of Largo and of her ex-wife , Donna .
" I am still wearing my wedding band .
...
We speak frequently , I still love her as much as I did before , " Stanton says .
" I love Largo , I still love Largo , I walked away with a sense of loss that not only did I lose my friends in the city , but the relationship with a community that I dearly loved .
" You just do n't discard that so easily . "
She said her job keeps her so busy that she does n't have time to worry much about her personal life .
" I have n't started [ dating ] yet , " she says .
" Psychologically , I 'm not there yet . "
She also does n't think about " Option C " anymore , which she defined in the documentary as suicide .
" I do n't worry , like I was at that point in the documentary , because I 'm gainfully employed , " Stanton said .
" I 'm not at that place .
But I also know , given the nature of my type of work , I could be back in that spot someday . "
Stanton walked away from being a spokesperson for the transgender community , but says she still represents the community " because of the prominence of my story . "
" Today my focus is being a city manager , not being a transgender advocate , " Stanton says .
" I promised people in that community [ transgender community ] two years ago when I walked off the stage -- I was gone . "
Stanton says her journey to become a woman does not mean she wants to forget about her life as a man .
" For the most part -- most things I do in my life -- the fact that Susan used to be Steven is totally irrelevant , " Stanton says .
" But it 's very much part of who I am .
I do n't think you can ever deny your human story . "
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - A South Korean naval ship sank near the disputed maritime border with North Korea , killing some of the more than 100 crew on board , but officials played down suggestions that it may have been attacked by the North .
South Korean naval ship Cheonan patrols the sea in an unidentified location in the territorial waters of South Korea in this undated file picture released by local Yonhap news agency in Seoul March 26 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Yonhap / Files
A defense ministry official later said that the unidentified object the vessel had fired at on Friday night near the western sea border that divides the two Koreas may well have been a flock of birds .
Initial fears that North Korea might be to blame caused ripples on Wall Street , where share prices dipped partly on geopolitical concerns , and the South Korean won dropped against the dollar .
“ It is premature to discuss the cause of this sinking , ” presidential Blue House spokeswoman Kim Eun - hye told Reuters early on Saturday .
“ It is not clear whether North Korea was involved . ”
The Joint Chiefs of Staff also said it could not conclude that the reclusive North was behind the attack .
Yonhap news agency quoted a presidential official as saying satellite pictures and other information showed no sign of the North Korean military in the area at the time of the sinking .
The defense ministry said 58 of the 104 on board had been rescued and Yonhap quoted navy officials as saying several had died .
“ An unidentified reason caused a hole in the ship , which led to its sinking .
Currently 58 have been rescued out of the total 104 on board .
Rescue efforts are under way , ” the ministry said .
“ The ship fired a warning shot at an unidentified object , and the object was later suspected to have been a flock of birds .
But we are checking . ”
Earlier , South Korean media had quoted officials as saying the North could have torpedoed the ship .
COLD SHOULDER
The sinking comes as the impoverished North has become increasingly frustrated by its wealthy neighbor , which has given the cold - shoulder to recent attempts to reopen a lucrative tourist business on the northern side of the Cold War ’s last frontier .
It also coincides with mounting pressure on Pyongyang to end a more than one - year boycott of international talks to end its efforts to build a nuclear arsenal .
Reports of a possible naval clash saw the won weaken roughly 0.45 percent against the dollar and were cited by analysts as one reason for a dip in U.S. stocks .
The price to insure Korean sovereign debt rose to 83 basis points from 78 basis points in the wake of the news , according to two trading sources .
That means the cost to insure $ 10 million in South Korean debt increased by $ 5,000 to $ 83,000 .
Markets have become used to saber - rattling by North Korea and occasional brief border skirmishes , and dips in response to such incidents tend to be quickly reversed .
In Seoul , the government held an emergency security meeting following the incident .
The ship sank near the disputed Yellow Sea border off the west coast of the peninsula which was the scene of two deadly naval fights between the rival Koreas in the past decade .
Navies from the rival Koreas exchanged gunfire for the first time in seven years in the Yellow Sea waters in November , damaging vessels on both sides .
The international community has been pressuring the North to give up efforts to build nuclear weapons , promising help for its broken economy if it does so .
There has been widespread speculation that North Korea ’s iron ruler , Kim Jong - il , was about to visit China , his only significant ally and on which he has depended almost entirely for economic aid after a new conservative government in Seoul effectively ended years of free - flowing assistance .
Tonight ’s YouGov poll shows the Lib Dem boost continuing .
The topline figures are CON 32 %( - 1 ) , LAB 26 %( - 3 ) , LDEM 33 % ( +4 ) , so following on from BPIX yesterday we now have YouGov putting the Lib Dems in the lead .
The 32 % is the lowest the Conservatives have been with YouGov since the election - that - never - was in 2007 , 26 % is the lowest Labour have been since the Conservative party conference boost last year .
The poll was conducted on Saturday and Sunday , so with the “ Lib Dem breakthrough ” dominating the media and the election narrative .
It ’s quite hard to guess what is going to happen next – on one hand the Lib Dems are likely to face a concerted attack from the other parties and hostile newspapers , on the other hand if they stay at this level there will be a snowballing effect of them being seen to be on a roll , the Lib Dem ’s normal weaknesses of being seen as a wasted vote will be whittled away , and if the two main parties start focusing their fire upon the Lib Dems it may well backfire by making them seem negative and the Lib Dems as the real challenger .
Back in November , we started hearing murmurs that Google was considering whether or not to factor site speed into its search ranking algorithm .
In a blog post today , the search giant confirms it is now adding site speed to its list of criteria that could affect your Google ranking .
It 's another step on Google 's long road toward achieving maximum speed and efficiency .
The company even launched a Site Performance tool as part of its Webmaster Tools suite to help assess site performance statistics and make changes accordingly .
Today 's blog post recommends a few other tools for evaluating your site 's speed as well , including the Firefox Add - on Page Speed , Yahoo's YSlow and WebPagetest .
The new site speed criterion is n't weighted as heavily as something like page relevance , however .
Google says less than 1 % of actual search queries performed are being affected by the site speed dimension in the current implementation .
Do you think web site performance should affect search result rankings ?

If you are like me , you will have said “ The one with the whopping great exclamation mark , of course ” .
Perhaps the key as to what the buttons actually mean will help you change your mind ?
No , saying not to press something just makes me want to press it more .
And where does it take you ?
To the website of boyband 911 where , if I was a typical user , I would stay and buy a copy of “ Party People ” on cassingle , rather than returning to Supergrass ’ site where I would have definitely have bought all 3 versions of “ Mary ” on CD instead .
It ’s not just usability where Supergrass went wrong in their 2000 web marketing , another is in their SEO .
There is a trick called “ cloaking ” in which you provide content just for search engines .
It ’s likely to get you slapped by search engines if they catch you doing such a thing .
Now let ’s go to Supergrass ’ shop …
What ’s that ?
A list of keywords .
I guess , they could always say it is something else other than cloaking .

Washington — You might imagine that if a terrorist attack killed an American public servant and threatened the lives of 200 people , it would have been big news for weeks and an enduring symbol of the risks taken by those who serve their country .
Yet when an American named Joseph Stack flew a plane into an office building in Austin , Texas , in February , killing Vernon Hunter , a 68 - year - old Vietnam veteran , the news reports were remarkably muted , and the story quickly disappeared .
Hunter worked for the Internal Revenue Service , which was housed in the Austin building , and according to Stack 's suicide note , the IRS was his target .
On or about April 15 , the Web and the commentary pages overflow with assaults on the IRS that cast its employees as jackbooted thugs , to use an old phrase , and our tax system as a form of oppression comparable to the exertions of the worst Russian czars and the most fiendish modern totalitarian dictators .
We should call this propaganda what it is : a sweeping falsehood that libels the work of committed federal employees such as Hunter .
Liberal Democrat leader signalled that he would speak to the Tories first about the formation of a minority government
Nick Clegg today signalled that he would speak to the Conservatives first about the formation of a minority government if Labour came third by share of the vote on 6 May , rejecting the constitutional convention that the prime minister should be allowed to try to form a government first .
The Liberal Democrat leader also made it explicit for the first time that electoral reform would be an unavoidable precondition of any coalition government as he insisted that Labour will have forfeited the right to govern if it comes third .
Labour tonight claimed Clegg had blundered by prematurely setting out new , detailed conditions on what would happen if there is no clear winner in the general election – claiming he looked arrogant and self - interested .
Lord Mandelson , Labour 's election strategist , immediately warned in a campaign memo that " voters who flirt with Nick Clegg are likely to end up married to David Cameron " .
He said Clegg " had made clear his hostility to Labour and his preference to side with the Tories in a coalition if this arises .
In other words , vote Nick and get Dave and George – not a nice prospect for people with progressive values . "
The latest tracking poll from YouGov in the Sun suggests that Labour remains in third place , but the Conservatives are not drawing away from Liberal Democrats .
The poll shows the Conservatives on 34 points ( no change ) , the Liberal Democrats on 30 ( up 1 ) and Labour on 28 ( down 1 ) .
The Lib Dems insisted that Clegg 's remarks were being over - interpreted , and he was merely rejecting the constitutional assumption that the prime minister in the event of a hung parliament would always have the first opportunity to try to form a minority government .
Clegg said he would not prop up Labour if it came third in the vote yet secured the most seats .
He said : " It seems to me that it 's just preposterous , the idea that if a party comes third in terms of the number of votes , it still has somehow the right to carry on squatting in No 10 and continue to lay claim to having the prime minister of the country .
" What I 'm saying here is pointing at a very , very irrational possible outcome of our potty electoral system , which is that a party that has spectacularly lost the election because fewer people are voting for it than any other party , could nonetheless according to constitutional tradition and convention still lay claim to providing the prime minister of the country . "
With the campaign entering its final full week , Clegg may feel he needed to send out an anti-Brown message as polling suggested the Tory leader , David Cameron , was gaining traction with his warning that if voters back Clegg , they will end up with Brown in No 10 .
Clegg also spoke for the first time about the possibility of sitting in cabinet with rival parties after the general election .
Liberal Democrat officials insisted their leader was not demanding Brown 's head as the price of co-operating with Labour in the event of a hung parliament .
But Clegg said Cameron and Brown would be vulnerable within their parties if they failed to secure an overall majority .
With characteristic frankness , the home secretary , Alan Johnson , said : " Look , it does n't take a genius to think that if you are third in the popular vote , then … you are not best - placed to deal with it .
We want to be first in the popular vote .
We are going out over the next 11 days – and there are an awful lot of uncommitted voters . "
Johnson said he was open to backing a more proportional voting system , closer to what Clegg wants , but another Labour electoral reformer , Peter Hain , told the Guardian that proportional systems break the link with constituencies and so make it more difficult to sack corrupt MPs .
Mandelson claimed in his campaign letter " as much as a third of the electorate are undecided .
The challenges facing the country require a workhorse at the helm , not a couple of show ponies . "
Liberal Democrats and Conservatives today ridiculed a request by Labour to broadcasters to focus more on policy analysis .
The opposition parties claimed the appeal revealed Labour 's unease at Brown 's weak performances in the leadership debates .
Brown will try to cut through what he regards as the media 's refusal to focus on policy by making three set - piece speeches this week on health , families and crime .
His speeches will put more emphasis on fairness and equality , rather than discussions on if it is right to withdraw £ 6bn from the economy this year .
Appearing without a tie , and offering more pugilistic rhetoric than before , he said : " The Tory motto is not ' God helps people who help themselves ' , but ' God helps those whom he has already helped ' . "
You remember Joe the Plumber , of course .
The glare from his bald head illuminated just how dumb our American election process is .
Now the English people have their very own Joe the Plumber .
Meet 65 year - old Gillian the Pensioner !
Like Joe the Plumber , Gillian the Pensioner was born of a photo op meet - and - greet gone awry .
The blue - haired pensioner is a classic British character :
She is both supremely polite , a fragile sort of midget pushing a bundle of groceries in a cart — but also disturbingly prone to racist and xenophobic thought .
And so when pensioner Gillian Duffy had a chance to give Prime Minister Gordon Brown — campaigning for his Labour party in Manchester today — a piece of her mind , she naturally asked : " All these eastern Europeans are coming in , where are they flocking from ? "
And then Gordon brown called her a " bigoted woman " !
( Watch the video . )
Which , no one is really surprised that he would say such a thing , since he 's a notorious bully who hurls stuff at his staff .
But , unfortunately , he was still miked by Sky News when he said it , driving away in his car .
Now we have a hilarious audio clip that features Gordon asking Gillian Duffy about her kids and telling her that " It 's very nice to see you , " then his dishing to an aide : " That was a disaster ... she was just sort of a bigoted woman . "
Just as Joe the Plumber represented the Real America Obama could never hope to understand , Gillian the Pensioner is now seen in the press as embodying Gordon Brown's " disconnect " from the average , xenophobic Brit .
It also fits deliciously with the stereotype of Gordon Brown as a " cranky , tired , and simply not very nice man . "
And now Gillian the Pensioner is being repped by Margaret Thatcher 's PR guy , presumably to lead Britain into a brilliant new far - right government .
So , Maybe she 's Britain 's Sarah Palin , actually ?
First they launched televised debates ; then an Obamaesque underdog ; now media - generated characters who represent the " Real " Britain .
Is n't that cute :
It 's almost like they 're having a real election !
Premier Dalton McGuinty is scrapping Ontario ’s controversial new sex education curriculum just two days after some religious leaders and parents objected to children being taught about masturbation and homosexuality .
While McGuinty denied Thursday he was bowing to pressure from the faith community with the climb - down , he conceded “ it ’s become pretty obvious to us that we should give this a serious re-think . ”
In future , parents will have more input into any changes to the 12 - year - old sex education guidelines , he said .
Evangelist Charles McVety , who led the charge against the revisions , told the Star “ we ’re very happy and we thank God that the premier came to his senses and withdrew this . ”
McVety ’s announcement Tuesday morning of an anti-curriculum demonstration to be held in Toronto next month sparked a firestorm of protest , and led to the premier ’s policy shift just 54 hours later .
“ It is a spectacular turnaround , ” McVety said .
Critics accused the premier of over - reacting to the concerns of a vocal minority and questioned the speed with which McGuinty dropped the proposed curriculum .
NDP MPP Rosario Marchese ( Trinity Spadina ) , an educator who backed many of the changes , said the U - turn “ clearly says to me this government does n’t know what they ’re doing . ”
“ I ’m worried about the fact that yesterday the premier said we ’re forging ahead because we think we ’re doing the right thing , and a day later he ’s saying we made a mistake , we should have consulted better , ” said Marchese .
However , the Canada Christian College president said the proposed curriculum pandered to “ a special interest group ” because homosexuality would have been discussed in Grade 3 , masturbation in Grade 6 , and oral and anal sex in Grade 7 .
Lou Piovesan , general secretary of the Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Ontario , said the bishops were concerned about the curriculum changes and were “ puzzled ” that the government had claimed the bishops were onside on Tuesday .
“ This is a very positive response on behalf of the government , ” Piovesan said of McGuinty ’s announcement Thursday .
“ The bishops had serious concerns about certain content and Catholic schools do have denominational rights , ” he said , referring to protections in the Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
McGuinty , who had insisted Tuesday and Wednesday the teaching plan needed to be updated for the Internet age , said at a London school “ we spent a good 24 to 48 hours listening to parents . ”
The premier admitted the Liberals failed to take into account multicultural sensibilities with the proposals – first quietly posted on the ministry of education website in January – but did not specify which were most contentious .
“ I ’m not sure there ’s one thing in particular .
I think it came out of nowhere , ” he said , adding “ the net that was cast in terms of consulting was too narrow . ”
“ We ’ve got to take some responsibility in government for that .
If we ’re going to put forward that kind of a proposal we need to make sure that people are aware that it ’s coming … I do n’t think much of that happened , frankly , in this case . ”
Sources say McGuinty “ made the call ” himself Thursday after hearing parents ’ outrage over the past few days .
With an election looming in October 2011 , it ’s unclear when any revamped curriculum would be unveiled .
The debacle erupted as the Liberal government battles with pharmacists over prescription drug prices and braces for a summer of consumer discontent with the July 1 launch of the new 13 - per-cent harmonized sales tax .
McGuinty ’s surprise move came just three hours after his ministers defended the scheme at Queen ’s Park .

During the morning question period , debate turned nasty with Transportation Minister Kathleen Wynne , who was education minister until January and oversaw the new curriculum development , calling the Progressive Conservatives “ despicable ” for opposing it .
“ You ’re aligning yourselves with homophobes , ” a visibly angry Wynne shouted at the Tories .
Wynne is the first openly lesbian cabinet minister in Ontario history .
After the Liberal flip - flop , Tory MPP Christine Elliott ( Whitby - Oshawa ) said the government was “ scrambling – they ’re making it up as they go along and they got caught flat out by us calling them out on it and by parents . ”
“ All of us have been receiving emails and calls into our constituency office by people who are really upset about this , ” said Elliott , whose party opposed the new curriculum .
Annie Kidder of advocacy group People for Education said McGuinty has over - reacted to a vocal minority .
“ It ’s very important that when we ’re thinking about public policy and thinking about education in particular , that we have to be careful and measured in our responses to various voices , ” including her own , said Kidder .
“ I really and truly think that this was not a reaction by a mass amount of parents to this new curriculum . ”
Children ’s health experts also urge that parents be “ clear , and open , and call things by the right names ” as the curriculum proposed for Grade 1 students , she noted .
Toronto Trustee Sheila
Ward said parents do need to have a say .
“ ( McGuinty ) has had lots of great ideas , and I know he wants to be known as the education premier , ” said Ward .
“ But he may fall short of the mark because of haste , just because of the lack of consultation . ”
Paula Peroni , president of the Ontario Catholic School Trustees ’ Association , said her organization has been unable to find any parents who were consulted on the changes .
“ Sex ed is something that ’s been taught in our curriculum forever , and we teach it in alignment and accordance with our Catholic faith , ” she said .
The physical health and education curriculum overhaul , the first since 1998 , began in 2007 and involved a year of research and consultation with public and Catholic boards , universities , faculties of education , health groups , public health units , among others .

Introduction
During intense exercise the development of the burn in muscle , referred to as acidosis , has been traditionally explained as an increase in the bodys production of lactic acid .
This lactic acid cause of acidosis , referred to as lactic acidosis is taught in many physiology , biochemistry and exercise physiology courses throughout the world .
The cause of the acidosis during intense exercise has been a weighty topic of discussion and debate with fitness professionals and personal trainers for years .
Many fitness specialists believe that lactic acid or lactate ( See Acidosis Question Box # 1 for explanation of difference ) production is the cause of muscle fatigue during vigorous exercise .
Most recently , Robergs and colleagues ( 2004 ) have completed an extensive review of the biochemistry of exercise - induced metabolic acidosis .
This expansive reexamination details a much more inclusive and enlightening understanding of lactate production and acidosis .
From this recent publication , brief highlights of the history of lactic acid understanding will be presented as well as a more contemporary scientific understanding of acidosis .
Some meaningful practical training applications for the applied fitness professional will be offered .
Lactic Acid : Brief History
Robergs et al. ( 2004 ) identify the discovery of lactic acid in 1789 to Carl Whilhelm Sheele , a Swedish chemist .
Sheele isolated an acid in sour milk samples .
This milk origin led to the naming of this acid to lactic , which means relating to milk .
Continuing with their historical account , Robergs et al. note that by 1810 chemists had verified the presence of lactic acid in other organic tissues such as fresh milk , meat and blood .
In 1833 , the actual chemical formula for lactic acid was determined .
By 1869 , scientists observed different isomers ( atomic compounds with different energy states ) of lactic acid along with its formation in fermentation reactions .
Fermentation is an enzyme - driven chemical change in an organic ( has carbon ) compound whereby the substance is split into simpler compounds .
Since lactic acid is a naturally occurring molecule , originally detected in food products ( and with a mild acidic taste ) , it has and continues to be used to acidify some foods and beverages as well as function as a food preservative .
For instance , Robergs et al. note that it is used to help preserve cucumbers , as an ingredient in brewing and flavoring of beer , an ingredient to make cheese , as a source of calcium ( calcium lactate ) in baby food , and an ingredient in bread . 
The prevailing understanding regarding lactic acidosis in humans can be attributed to some early researchers of skeletal muscle biochemistry during exercise .
Two noted original researchers were Otto Meyerhoff and Archibald V. Hill , who in 1922 both received a Nobel prize for their research in the energy capabilities of carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle .
Robergs and colleagues ( 2004 ) point out that it was Meyerhoff who suggested that lactic acid was a side reaction to glycolysis ( splitting of sugar ) in the absence of oxygen .
They continue that the research of Hill and Meyerhoff solidified the acceptance of lactic acid production and acidosis into the mind - set of academics in physiology and biochemistry , although this was primarily based from their ( incomplete ) observations of cell metabolism at that time .
Robergs states , ... it is easy to comprehend how the Nobel prize quality of work of Hill and Meyerhoff was proof enough to the scientific world at that time for the interpretation that lactate production and acidosis were cause - and - effect . 
It is important to stress that this revealing and interesting history of acidosis and lactate exposes one important message .
There really never was experimental research demonstrating a cause - effect relationship between lactate production and acidosis .
Yet , the work of these early pioneers has been considered the absolute explanation of acidosis for more than 80 years .
Why is Lactate Still Thought to Cause Acidosis ?
Many educators and researchers still consider that lactate production is the cause of acidosis .
Robergs and colleagues ( 2004 ) explain that most texts simply do not provide and explain the chemically balanced reactions occurring during metabolic acidosis .
This incomplete description of acidosis in textbooks has led to the acceptance of the misconceptions of lactate held by many fitness professionals and exercise scientists .
What is the Actual Cause of Acidosis ?
During vigorous exercise , the ATP ( high - energy compound from which the cells derive energy ) demands of muscle contraction are considerable .
Every time an ATP molecule is split for energy ( by a water molecule ... why we call it hydrolysis ) it is broken down into an ADP and inorganic phosphate WITH the release of one hydrogen ion ( another name for a hydrogen ion is a proton ; the proton comes from the water molecule ) .
It is the increase in protons that causes acidosis , quantified by a decrease in pH below 7.0 .
When the ATP demands of exercise are being met by aerobic metabolism ( called mitochondrial respiration ) , the accumulated protons are used in important aspects of cell metabolism .
However , during very intense exercise ( above steady state or during high - intensity resistance training ) , an accumulation of protons occurs in the muscle due to a much greater involvement of the phosphagen and glycolytic energy systems providing ATP for the muscle contraction .
Robergs et al. ( 2004 ) biochemically explain and illustrate ( with chemical structure reactions ) in their article how the hydrolysis of ATP supplied from the phosphagen and glycolygic energy systems is the source of the increased proton accumulation in the cell , and thus THE CAUSE of acidosis ( the burn ) .
What about Lactate Production and the Role of Lactate ?
During the demands of high - intensity exercise , the cell is utilizing a lot of glucose ( from glycolysis ) and muscle glycogen ( stored form of glucose ) .
The final step of glucose breakdown results in the production of two molecules of pyruvate .
The pyruvate molecules begin to accumulate in the cell , as well as the protons ( from the splitting of ATP ) from the vigorous exercise .
In order to neutralize the soaring accumulation of pyruvate and protons ( from the splitting of ATP ) , each pyruvate molecule absorbs two protons into its structure , converting to lactate .
Thus , lactate production is ACTUALLY A CONSEQUENCE of cellular acidosis and NOT the cause of the acidosis .
More blatantly , lactate production actually RETARDS ACIDOSIS .
Lactate is a temporary neutralizer or buffer to the cells elevated accumulation of protons during high - intensity exercise .
Since increased lactate production coincides with acidosis , lactate measurement is an excellent indirect marker for the metabolic condition of the cell .
Lactate production is therefore good and not bad for contracting muscle .
Lactate is not a bad molecule , and it has been given a bad rap from being falsely blamed for the cause of acidosis .
What Are The Training Applications from this Acidosis Update ?
Personal trainers and fitness professionals can utilize this contemporary understanding of acidosis information for endurance and resistance exercise design .
For endurance training , a modern training method is lactate threshold training , which is an aerobic training technique that helps to improve the contribution of ATP from mitochondrial respiration , thus decreasing the reliance on glycolysis .
This type of training has been thoroughly reported in a past IDEA Personal Trainer magazine article ( Dalleck , L.C. & Kravitz , L. ( 2003 ) .
Optimize Endurance Training , Volume 14 Number 1 pp 36 - 42 ) . ( CLICK HERE ) .
For optimizing clients and students doing high - intensity resistance exercise , fitness professionals are encouraged to also incorporate endurance exercise in the training design .
This important training addition will eventually lead to a better proton buffering capacity for the exercisers , thus inhibiting a major contributing factor to fatigue when they do their challenging resistance exercise workouts .
Acidosis Question Box # 1 . What is the Difference in Lactic Acid and Lactate ?
Although used interchangeable , lactic acid and lactate are not the same compound .
Lactic acid is an acid , which by definition means that it can release a proton for pH conditions < 7.0
Thus , when lactic acid releases a hydrogen ion , the remaining compound ( which is negatively charged ) joins with a positively charged ion [ sodium ion ( Na + ) or potassium ion ( K+ ) ] to form an acid salt ( e.g. , sodium lactate ) .
Robergs et al. ( 2004 ) show through detailed chemical reactions that lactic acid is not produced in the body .
Rather , lactate is the product of a side reaction in glycolysis .
Acidosis Question Box # 2 . Why Does High - Intensity Resistance Training Result in Acidosis ( the burn ) ?
During high - intensity resistance training , the bodys more explosive fast - twitch motor units are recruited to overcome the resistance loads .
The fuel for this energy demand comes primarily from the anaerobic metabolism ( phosphagen and glycolytic energy systems ) .
Fast - twitch muscle fibers have fewer mitochondria ( where cell respiration occurs as well as the uptake of protons ) than slow - twitch , or aerobic endurance fibers .
Thus , during high - intensity resistance training , because of the extensive use of the fast - twitch fibers ( with few mitochondria and less uptake of protons ) there is a greater accumulation of protons , causing acidosis .

Diabetes is " incurable ? "
( Natural News )
This is a " must listen " interview for anyone suffering from diabetes , obesity or blood sugar disorders .
It 's commercial - free and it's a free download of an MP3 file that will play on any computer or MP3 player .
What you 'll hear in this interview will absolutely astound you -- it rocks the world of conventional medicine and its failed diabetes treatments .
This is an interview with Dr. Gabriel Cousens , founder of thein Patagonia , Arizona ( www.TreeofLife.nu ) .
In this audio interview , you 'll hear Dr. Cousens describe why and how consuming raw foods really works to initiatein fasting blood sugar levels , effectivelyin a matter of just a few weeks .
This is essentially .
Not coincidentally , Dr. Cousens is the author of the book .
The book documents the successes of eleven people who went on a raw foods diet and experienced rapid and remarkable improvements in physiology , including : • Curing of both type - 1 and type - 2 diabetes . •
Rapid loss of body fat• Rapid stabilization of blood sugar• Remarkable improvements in cognitive functionListen to the full interview here :
This is afor anyone suffering from diabetes or blood sugar disorders .
For type - 2 diabetes , the process described by Dr. Cousens in the interview boasts aThis is truly astounding .
Nothing from the world of conventional medicine can offer even a 1 % cure rate for diabetes .
Conventional medicine ( and the American Diabetes Association ) continues to insist that diabetes in incurable .
The approach of conventional medicine , based on extremely toxic chemical medications and processed dead foods , simply does not work .
It 's actually quite toxic to patients rather than healing .
Diabetes medications are well known to cause severe liver damage , for example .
But the conscious consumption of raw living foods turns on the body 's innate healing processes .
This creates a rapid healing response that allows the body to reverse many of the physiological degeneration processes that created disease in the first place .
That 's whyandhave become such popular self - healing therapies for weight loss , diabetes reversal and enhanced longevity .
Conventional medicine remains utterly ignorant of the healing power of raw living foods , preferring instead to rely on patented chemical medications that simply do n't work to heal anyone or anything ..
It has never happened in the history of medicine .
And yet type - 2 diabetes can be cured at a rate of 90 % - 95 % with a raw living foods diet .

Interview : Eben Moglen - Freedom vs. The Cloud Log
Eben Moglen interviewed by Glyn Moody
Free software has won : practically all of the biggest and most exciting Web companies like Google , Facebook and Twitter run on it .
But it is also in danger of losing , because those same services now represent a huge threat to our freedom as a result of the vast stores of information they hold about us , and the in - depth surveillance that implies .
Eben Moglen - Prof. of Law at Columbia and former General Counsel for the FSF .
Better than almost anyone , Eben Moglen knows what 's at stake .
He was General Counsel of the Free Software Foundation for 13 years , and helped draft several versions of the GNU GPL .
As well as being Professor of Law at Columbia Law School , he is the Founding Director of the Software Freedom Law Center .
And he has an ambitious plan to save us from those seductive but freedom - threatening Web service companies .
He explained to Glyn Moody what the problem is , and how we can fix it .
Glyn Moody :
So what 's the threat you are trying to deal with ?
Eben Moglen :
We have a kind of social dilemma which comes from architectural creep .
We had an Internet that was designed around the notion of peerage - machines with no hierarchical relationship to one another , and no guarantee about their internal architectures or behaviours , communicating through a series of rules which allowed disparate , heterogeneous networks to be networked together around the assumption that everybody 's equal .
In the Web the social harm done by the client - server model arises from the fact that logs of Web servers become the trails left by all of the activities of human beings , and the logs can be centralised in servers under hierarchical control .
Web logs become power .
With the exception of search , which is a service that nobody knows how to decentralise efficiently , most of these services do not actually rely upon a hierarchical model .
They really rely upon the Web - that is , the non-hierarchical peerage model created by Tim Berners - Lee , and which is now the dominant data structure in our world .
The services are centralised for commercial purposes .
The power that the Web log holds is monetisable , because it provides a form of surveillance which is attractive to both commercial and governmental social control .
So the Web , with services equipped in a basically client - server architecture , becomes a device for surveillance as well as providing additional services .
And surveillance becomes the hidden service wrapped inside everything we get for free .
The cloud is a vernacular name which we give to a significant improvement in the server - side of the web - the server , decentralised .
It becomes , instead of a lump of iron , a digital appliance , which can be running anywhere .
This means that for all practical purposes servers cease to be subject to significant legal control .
They no longer operate in a policy - directed manner , because they are no longer iron , subject to territorial orientation of law .
In a world of virtualised service provision , the server which provides the service , and therefore the log which is the result of the hidden service of surveillance , can be projected into any domain at any moment and can be stripped of any legal obligation pretty much equally freely .
This is a pessimal result .
GM : Was perhaps another major factor in this the commercialisation of the Internet , which saw power being vested in a company that provided services to the consumer ?
EM : That 's exactly right .
Capitalism also has its architectural Bauplan , which it is reluctant to abandon .
In fact , much of what the network is doing to capitalism is forcing it to reconsider its Bauplan via a social process which we call by the crappy name of dis-intermediation .
Which is really a description of the Net forcing capitalism to change the way it takes .
But there 's lots of resistance to that , and what 's interesting to all of us I suspect , as we watch the rise of Google to pre-eminence , is the ways in which Google does and does not - and it both does and does not - wind up behaving rather like Microsoft in the course of growing up .
There are sort of gravitational propositions that arise when you 're the largest organism in an ecosystem .
GM : Do you think free software has been a little slow to address the problems you describe ?
EM : Yes , I think that 's correct .
I think it is conceptually difficult , and it is to a large degree difficult because we are having generational change .
After a talk [ I gave recently ] , a young woman came up to me and she said : I 'm 23 years old , and none of my friends care about privacy .
And that 's another important thing , right ? , because we make software now using the brains and hands and energies of people who are growing up in a world which has been already affected by all of this .
Richard or I can sound rather old - fashioned .
GM : So what 's the solution you are proposing ?
EM : If we had a real intellectually - defensible taxonomy of services , we would recognise that a number of the services which are currently highly centralised , and which count for a lot of the surveillance built in to the society that we are moving towards , are services which do not require centralisation in order to be technologically deliverable .
They are really the Web repackaged .
Social networking applications are the most crucial .
They rely in their basic metaphors of operation on a bilateral relationship called friendship , and its multilateral consequences .
And they are eminently modelled by the existing structures of the Web itself .
Facebook is free Web hosting with some PHP doodads and APIs , and spying free inside all the time - not actually a deal we can't do better than .
My proposal is this : if we could disaggregate the logs , while providing the people all of the same features , we would have a Pareto - superior outcome .
Everybody – well , except Mr Zuckenberg - would be better off , and nobody would be worse off .
And we can do that using existing stuff .

A courageous man and a competent leader , Sayid maintained a conservative manner which reflected his strength and spirituality .
Sayid spent much of his adult life searching for his love , Nadia , and trying to atone for his past .
On the Island , his skills and leadership played a key role in his group 's survival .
Sayid worked to find the source of a distress signal and met the woman who sent it out .
He developed a relationship with Shannon , another survivor , and was devastated by her accidental death .
Sayid proved very useful in the survivors ' fight against the Others , first interrogating one who they trapped and later helping Kate and Locke rescue Jack .
Sayid was one of the Oceanic Six , who publicly escaped the Island .
He reunited with Nadia , but when a hit - and - run driver killed her , Sayid joined Benjamin Linus as a hitman against Widmore to avenge her death .
Afterwards , he did charity work in the Dominican Republic , but Ilana forced him aboard Ajira Airways Flight 316 , returning him to the Island .
Sayid found himself in 1977 , where the DHARMA Initiative captured him , believing him a Hostile .
He escaped and unsuccessfully tried to kill young Ben , whose father then shot him .
After he returned to 2007 , he died , but the Man in Black resurrected him and recruited him to his side .
After this , Sayid lived in the Man in Black 's group in an almost blank - like state .
After speaking with Desmond , he broke out of this state and was later redeemed when he sacrificed himself aboard Widmore 's submarine , exploding while carrying the Man in Black 's bomb .
In the flash - sideways , he was reunited with his island lover , Shannon Rutherford , and along with their friends , they moved on .

Before the crash
Childhood
Sayid Jarrah was born around 1967 in Tikrit , Iraq , the son of a celebrated Iraqi hero .
While in school , a girl named Nadia from a wealthy family regularly pushed Sayid into the mud out of affection , but Sayid misunderstood her advances and ignored her .
( " Solitary " )
Sayid once killed a chicken for his older brother , who hesitated when asked by their father to do so ; Sayid 's father commented , " At least one of my sons will be a man someday . "
( " He 's Our You " )
After finishing school , Sayid attended Cairo University .
Military career
Sayid served as a Communications Officer in the Iraqi Republican Guard for five years .
He learned crucial skills but engaged in morally questionable acts , including an as - yet unexplained incident in Basra .
Sayid sees Nadia for the first time since their childhood .
( " Solitary " )
U.S. forces captured Sayid 's base during Operation Desert Storm when he was a mulazim awwal ( 1st lieutenant ) , equivalent to a U.S. major general .
An American sergeant major assigned Sayid , the unit 's only English - speaker , to interrogate his own commanding officer .
When Sayid evaded this task out of loyalty , Kelvin Inman , a DIA operative , showed him a video of his officer 's nerve gas attacking his home village .
Sayid then tortured his CO , giving the testimony he received to the Americans , who paid him significantly before releasing him .
( " One of Them " )
The Republican Guard promoted Sayid to the rank of Ra'id ( Major ) in the Intelligence division , where he tortured and interrogated military prisoners .
He began questioning his loyalties , though when forced to interrogate Nadia , who had joined an insurgent group .
When his superior officer , ordered her execution , Sayid killed him to help her escape , shooting himself as well and giving her his gun .
He refused to flee with Nadia , fearing for his family .
She left him her photo with the Arabic inscription ; " You will see me in the next life , if not in this one . " ( " Solitary " )
Intervening years
Sayid left Iraq in 1997 and spent the next several years searching for Nadia , never staying in a single location for more than a few months .
( " The Greater Good " )
He spent some time in Paris cooking for a small restaurant , but though he used the alias Najeev and claimed to be Syrian , he could n't escape his past .
One of his torture victims recognized him , and her husband kidnapped him by pretending to hire him as a chef .
Imprisoned in their basement , Sayid first protested his innocence but then privately confessed to his victim , who forgave and released him after telling him a story about her cat .
( " Enter 77 " ) He left Paris soon after before he could learn the local language .
( " Pilot , Part 2 " ) ( " Whatever the Case May Be " ) Years later , he considered returning to Paris for his first wedding anniversary .
( " The Incident , Part 2 " )
Flight 815
In 2004 , Sayid was arrested in Heathrow Airport and delivered to CIA and ASIS officials .
The agents offered him Nadia 's whereabouts if he infiltrated his college roommate 's Sydney terrorist cell and convinced him to martyr himself to further their investigations .
If he refused , they threatened to detain Nadia indefinitely overseas .
Sayid agreed , but he revealed his betrayal at the last minute to his roommate , who immediately shot himself .
Sayid delayed his flight to Nadia in California so he could arrange a proper Muslim burial .
( " The Greater Good " )
In Sydney Airport the following day , Sayid met Shannon and asked her to watch his bag .
She instead reported him to airport security as an " Arab man " who 'd left a bag unattended .
After interrogation , airport security released him with apologies , and he successfully boarded Flight 815 .
He sat in the last seat in business class and spent takeoff looking at photos of Nadia .
( " Exodus , Part 2 " )
On the Island
Days 1 – 44 ( Season 1 )
After the crash , Sayid made a signal fire and asked Charlie to help .
The next day , Sawyer accused him of being a terrorist and the US Marshal 's prisoner .
But Sayid 's early contributions , which his military background facilitated , soon proved him a vital member of the group .
He fixed the plane 's transceiver and led an expedition to high ground to receive a signal .
There , he picked up a French signal .
He deduced that it had looped for 16 years , and asked the group to withhold this information from the others .
( " Pilot , Part 1 " ) ( " Pilot , Part 2 " ) ( " Tabula Rasa " ) Later , Sayid attempted to locate the signal 's origin , but Locke knocked him unconscious and smashed his equipment .
( " The Moth " ) ( " The Greater Good " )
A few days later , after wild boars entered the fuselage , Sayid disagreed with Jack 's plan to burn the bodies .
Sayid and Kate , who 'd developed a friendship , started to police the Island after water disappeared , initially blaming Sawyer .
Sayid stopped a fight between Jin and Michael and insisted that Jin be handcuffed till he could figure what had happened .
Later , Sayid disagreed with Jack 's plan to move to the caves , believing in the signal fire 's importance .
( " Walkabout " ) ( " White Rabbit " ) ( " House of the Rising Sun " )
When he suspected Sawyer of hoarding Shannon 's asthma medicine , Sayid tortured him , injuring his arm .
Sayid later learned Sawyer was innocent and left the beach on a solitary journey of redemption .
( " Confidence Man " )
Sayid followed a cable from the beach into a trap and hung for hours until Danielle Rousseau cut him loose .
She tortured and interrogated him about her daughter 's whereabouts , and Sayid told her of the crash about hearing her distress signal .
Rousseau found a photo of Nadia , and Sayid said she was dead , because of him .
Later , Rousseau showed Sayid her music box and Sayid fixed it .
She then told Sayid about the Others .
Sayid escaped , stealing Rousseau 's maps and notes , and hearing whispers coming out from the jungle .
( " Solitary " )
Sayid returned to camp and told Jack and Sawyer they were " not alone " , which eased his and Sawyer 's conflict .
( " Raised by Another " ) ( " All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues " )
He enlisted Shannon 's help translating Rousseau 's maps , and though they discovered only song lyrics , they developed a relationship , which included a date at an isolated beach .
( " Whatever the Case May Be " ) ( " Do No Harm " ) Shannon 's brother initially objected to the relationship .
Sayid delivered the eulogy at his funeral .
( " Hearts and Minds " ) ( " Do No Harm " )
Shannon asked Sayid to kill Locke , whom she blamed for Boone 's death , but he refused and later stopped her from doing it herself .
The two temporarily broke up .
( " The Greater Good " ) Rousseau came to camp and kidnapped Aaron , and Sayid led Charlie into the Jungle in pursuit .
They successfully rescued the baby , and a worried Shannon embraced him on his return .
( " Exodus , Part 2 " ) ( " Exodus , Part 3 " )
Days 45 –67 ( Season 2 )
Sayid repaired the Swan 's computer when it broke , and he later discovered thick concrete reminiscent of Chernobyl in its foundations .
( " Man of Science , Man of Faith " ) ( " Orientation " ) Shannon began seeing visions of Walt , but Sayid remained skeptical .
( " Man of Science , Man of Faith " )
He continued his efforts to comfort her over Boone 's death though by building her a beautiful tent where they made love .
Soon after , they shared a vision of Walt .
As Shannon ran towards it , Ana Lucia mistook her for an Other and shot her .
Sayid held her as she died .
( " Abandoned " )
He then tried to attack Ana Lucia , but Mr. Eko stopped and fought him , and Sayid was eventually knocked out by Ana Lucia .
The tail section survivors then tied him to a tree .
Ana and Sayid talked , and given the chance , Sayid refused to kill her .
They returned to camp , Sayid carrying Shannon 's body .
( " Collision " )
Sayid returns to camp with Shannon 's body . ( " Collision " )
He spoke the next day at her funeral , saying he loved her .
( " What Kate Did " ) Sayid led the effort to extinguish a fire Charlie set .
( " Fire + Water " )
The following day , he fixed the tail - section radio for Hurley , and when he later asked to play it for Libby , Sayid recommended the beach he and Shannon had visited .
( " The Long Con " ) ( " Two for the Road " )
When Danielle believed she had trapped an Other , she came to Sayid first .
They took " Henry Gale " to the Swan , and Locke convinced Sayid to interrogate him .
The prisoner claimed he'd buried his wife on the island , but Sayid saw through the lies , recalled Shannon 's death and attacked him till Jack pulled him off .
Later Sayid sat on the beach with Charlie .
Sayid told him that there was a man in the hatch and he knew he was an Other because he felt no guilt for what he did to him .
He then asked Charlie if he had forgotten about what the others did to him .
( " One of Them " )
Sayid , Ana Lucia and Charlie checked out Henry 's story by trekking to his wife 's supposed grave .
They found a grave , but Sayid dug through it , finding the real Henry Gale 's body .
( " The Whole Truth " ) ( " Lockdown " )
Sayid interrogated the prisoner till he admitted being an Other , and Ana - Lucia had to intervene to stop Sayid from shooting him .
( " Dave " ) Michael returned to camp after time with the Others , and Sayid realized he had " been compromised . "
On their way to Libby and Ana Lucia 's funeral , Sayid told Jack of his suspicions of Michael 's motives and told him he was working on a plan .
At the funeral , a sailboat appereared just offshore .
( " Three Minutes " )
Sayid , Jack , and Sawyer swam out to the boat and discovered a drunken Desmond inside .
Sayid used the boat to configure a plan .
He told Jack while his group went on land he could travel by sea quicker and scout out The Others .
When he asked Desmond if he could use the boat he admitted he did not know how to sail .
Jin came along to sail and Sun came to translate .
While sailing they discovered the ruins of The Statue of Taweret .
Sayid commented that he did not know which was more odd , that the rest of it was missing , or that the foot only had four toes .
Sayid sailed to the Others ' camp and found it deserted , an apparent hatch masking only a wall of rock .
Sayid created a signal fire as planned and returned to the Elizabeth when the discharge occurred .
( " Live Together , Die Alone , Part 1 " ) ( " Live Together , Die Alone , Part 2 " )
Days 68–91 ( Season 3 )
Believing his friends captured , Sayid tried luring the Others to a second signal fire at the Pala Ferry , but they attacked by sea and took the Elizabeth .
( " The Glass Ballerina " )
Back at the camp , Sayid joined Locke 's mission to the Pearl , patching an unknown station 's feed till an eye - patched man briefly appeared on a monitor .
They found Eko mortally wounded when they left the station , and though skeptical , Sayid followed Locke 's party on a journey guided by Eko 's stick , where he discovered the Flame station .
He correctly guessed that its occupant ( who shot him ) was an Other , that others lived in the station and that a trap door led to a secret basement .
He and Kate captured Mikhail , who identified Sayid and told him that he was not on " the list " because he is " weak and frightened . "
Sayid noted underground cables on Mikhail 's map connecting the Flame and the Barracks on the other side of the Island .
The group encountered the sonic fence , and Sayid realized its purpose .
( " The Cost of Living " ) ( " Enter 77 " ) ( " Par Avion " )
The party reached the Barracks , and the Others tied up Sayid and Kate in a playground .
He met Alex and identified her as Danielle 's daughter .
When the Others left the Barracks , he mistrusted his suspicion continued when they returned to camp .
He and Sawyer accosted her , and she confronted him with her knowledge of a hereto unmentioned incident ( " The Man from Tallahassee " ) ( " Left Behind " ) ( " One of Us " ) Sayid later learned about Naomi 's arrival , and he tried to use her satellite phone .
After Sawyer told Sayid that Juliet was Ben 's mole , Sayid shared the news about Naomi with others .
( " The Brig " ) ( " The Man Behind the Curtain " )
Jack and Juliet explained their plan to ambush the Others though , and Sayid convinced Jack to lead the survivors to the radio tower while he Jin and Bernard stayed behind with to plant dynamite at the camp .
( " The Man Behind the Curtain " ) ( " Greatest Hits " )
Sayid successfully killed several Others , but one disarmed him because he could save Jin , who 'd been taken hostage .
He resisted interrogation , and when Ben ordered their deaths , their captors shot the ground in a mock execution .
Hurley arrived in a van to save them , and Sayid tripped an Other and snapped his neck with his legs .
Sayid , Jin and Bernard joined Hurley , Sawyer and Juliet on the beach .
( " Through the Looking Glass , Part 1 " ) ( " Through the Looking Glass , Part 2 " )
Days 91–108 ( Season 4 )
Desmond told Sayid what Charlie had learned in the Looking Glass , and Sayid warned against calling Jack in case their " rescuers " monitored their communications .
They met Locke on the way to Jack , and Sayid confronted him about blowing up the sub , but when Jack attacked him for killing Naomi , Sayid separated the two .
Despite mistrusting the rescuers , he stayed with Jack 's group when the survivors split , where he gathered guns with Juliet .
The two fired shots at Miles Straume and Daniel Faraday , who were holding Jack and Kate , and Sayid informally interrogated them .
The group found Frank Lapidus and his helicopter , and Sayid declared the aircraft fit to fly .
( " The Beginning of the End " ) ( " Confirmed Dead " )
Sayid offered to retrieve Charlotte from Locke 's group in exchange for a place on the helicopter .
Miles and Kate went with him .
He went to the Barracks with Miles and Kate and found Hurley tied up in a closet , where Locke had left his as bait .
Sayid discovered
Ben 's secret room then left , and Locke captured him .
Sayid offered Miles in exchange for Charlotte then returned to the helicopter and left with Frank , Desmond , and Naomi 's body .
( " The Economist " )
Desmond 's consciousness began traveling through time , and Sayid calmed him and contacted the Island .
The crew locked the pair in a room , but they escaped , and Sayid repaired sabotaged radio equipment so Desmond could call his girlfriend and anchor his consciousness .
( " The Constant " ) Desmond and Sayid spent time again confined before meeting the Captain , then encountered Michael , who was using the alias " Kevin Johnson " .
Sayid initially withheld Michael 's identity and confronted him in private , but he outed him to the Captain after hearing his full story .
Keamy 's men returned , and Sayid , knowing they planned to kill those on the island , boarded a raft to ferry people to the boat .
On the island though , he handed the raft to Daniel and pursued Jack and Sawyer , who were chasing the helicopter .
Richard Alpert and some Others captured him and Kate at gunpoint .
( " Meet Kevin Johnson " ) ( " Cabin Fever " ) ( " There 's No Place Like Home , Part 1 " )
Richard agreed to let them leave the island if they helped rescue Ben .
After ambushing Keamy 's team , Sayid tackled and fought Keamy until Richard gunned him down .
Sayid and Kate found Sawyer , Jack , Hurley and Frank at the helicopter and they flew to the Kahana , where they refueled and patched a leak before taking off again .
The Kahana exploded , and they turned back to the island , but it vanished .
Sayid tossed out an inflatable life raft , and they crashed into the ocean .
They drifted till they reached a boat .
A week later , they paddled the raft to the island of Sumba .
( " There 's No Place Like Home , Parts 2 & 3 " )
After leaving the Island
2005
After leaving the Island , Sayid became a member of the group known as the Oceanic Six .
Nadia found him after their conference and the two later married .
The couple attended Hurley 's surprise birthday party and Christian Shephard 's funeral service .
( " There 's No Place Like Home , Part 1 " ) .
After nine months - described later by Sayid as the happiest time in his life - they were walking in Los Angeles discussing their upcoming anniversary when a man asked Sayid for directions .
Nadia crossed the street and was hit by a car .
( " The Incident , Part 1 " ) Five days later , Sayid held her funeral in Iraq and caught Ben spying on him .
Ben said one of Widmore 's men killed Nadia , and Sayid later found him holding Ben at gunpoint and killed him .
Seeking further revenge , Sayid asked for other victims .
( " The Shape of Things to Come " )
2006 –2007
Sayid is taken care of by Ben , after killing Elsa . ( " The Economist " )
Sayid came to work for Benjamin Linus -- tracking down and killing Charles Widmore 's employees , allegedly to protect the other Oceanic 6 members .
( " He 's Our You " )
One such mission occurred in Seychelles , where Sayid shot a fellow golfer .
In a mission in Berlin , he initiated a relationship with a target 's employee .
She too though was using him for information , and a confrontation killed her and wounded Sayid .
( " The Economist " )
After he killed the final target ) , Ben ended their partnership .
( " He 's Our You " )
Cut loose , Sayid traveled to the Dominican Republic and worked for a charity organization .
A wheelchair - bound John Locke visited him , urging him to return to the Island , but Sayid refused .
Ben visited him as well , saying John had died , and that a man was watching Hurley .
Sayid arrived at Santa Rosa Mental Institute and killed the man and convinced Hurley to leave the institute for a safe house .
( " The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham " ) ( " He's Our You " ) ( " There 's No Place Like Home , Part 2 " )
There , he confessed working for Ben but advised Hurley to do the opposite of whatever Ben suggested .
He detected intruders , tossed one over the balcony and impaled another on a knife set , but not before a dart hit him .
The tranquilizers were enough to put Sayid unconscious for over 42 hours , during which Hurley took the sedated Sayid to his mansion , then asked his father to drive him to Jack 's hospital .
Jack treated Sayid , who then attacked the doctor upon awakening .
Shortly afterwards , Sayid attacked an assassin disguised as a nurse .
Once Jack drives Sayid back to Hurley 's home , they find Ben , and though hostile , Sayid decides to accompany his former contractor as he met his lawyer .
The two drove to a dock where they met Jack , Kate and Sun. ( " Because You Left " ) ( " The Lie " ) ( " The Little Prince " ) Tired of Ben 's lies , Sayid left the group .
( " This Place Is Death " )
Soon after , Illana found Sayid drinking in a Los Angeles bar .
She seduced him , then pulled out a gun , claiming to represent his Seychelles victim 's family .
She took him aboard Ajira 316 in handcuffs .
Sayid noticed other members of the Oceanic Six at the gate and tried unsuccessfully to convince Illana to take a later flight .
When Ben boarded , he suspected Ilana worked for him .
In the air , the plane hit turbulence , and a bright light surrounded the survivors .
( " He 's Our You " ) ( " 316 " )
Back on the Island
1977 ( Season 5 )
Sayid , back on the Island , is mistaken for a Hostile . ( " Namaste " )
Like several Ajira Flight 316 passengers , Sayid appeared on the Island in 1977 , where Radzinsky and the rest of the DHARMA Initiative believed he was a Hostile .
Jin and Radzinsky locked him inside the Flame , and Sawyer arrived and interrogated him .
Sawyer offered to integrate him into DHARMA , but Sayid refused .
Later on , a young boy brought him a sandwich , introduced himself as Ben Linus and promised him to help him escape .
A later visit angered the boy 's father , who slammed him into the bars .
Horace and Radzinsky threatened to take the interrogation to the next level , and took Sayid is then taken to Initiative 's interrogator , who drugged him .
Under the influence , Sayid shared knowledge of the island and revealed he'd traveled from the future , first worrying then angering his captors .
They returned him to his cell and voted to execute him .
Sawyer tried to help him escape , but Sayid turned him down , wishing to stay and kill young Ben .
Ben distracted the security team with a burning van and freed Sayid , who escaped into the jungle , knocked out Jin , stole his gun and shot Ben. ( " Namaste " ) ( " He 's Our You " )
Two days later , Sayid saw Jack , Kate , Richard Alpert , Eloise Hawking and Erik in the jungle .
He shot Erik , who was aiming at Kate , and Jack explained his plan to detonate " Jughead " .
They traveled through an underwater tunnel to the bomb 's chamber , where Sayid extracted its thermonuclear core .
To travel through the barracks , he suggested donning DHARMA jumpsuits , but Roger Linus spotted him anyway and shot him .
Hurley picked up Sayid and Jack in a van and took them to the Swan site .
Though gravely wounded , Sayid rigged the bomb so it would detonate on impact .
( " Follow the Leader " ) ( " The Incident , Parts 1 & 2 " )
2007 ( Season 6 )
Sayid remained injured from Roger 's bullet after the survivors traveled forward to 2007 .
Hurley and the rest rushed him to the temple stream , but he died after the Others submerged him .
Hours later though , he returned to life .
The Others dragged him to another room , where Dogen tortured him .
Lennon called the ordeal a " test " and that he had " passed " .
Later , Jack tried to give him a pill from Dogen , and Sayid , trusting Jack , agreed .
Jack then changed his mind and later told Sayid he 'd learned the pill was poison .
( " LA X , Parts 1 & 2 " ) ( " What Kate Does " ) ( " Lighthouse " )
Confronted , Dogen told Sayid the test proved evil had taken over him .
Dogen then fought and almost killed Sayid , but stopped and instead gave him a knife and a mission to assassinate the Man in Black .
Sayid encountered the Man in Black in the jungle in Locke 's form and stabbed him in the chest .
The Man in Black was unfazed and said Dogen had tried to con Sayid into going to his death .
The Man in Black then cryptically offered anything Sayid wanted in exchange for his help , though the one thing Sayid wanted had " died in his arms " , alluding to Shannon or Nadia .
Sayid returned to the Temple and told the Others to leave or die .
He then met again with Dogen , drowned him in the spring and slit Lennon 's throat right after .
Ben entered the room and told Sayid there was still time to leave , but Sayid simply replied , " Not for me . "
The Monster rampaged through the Temple .
After , Sayid walked through the carnage , joined the Man in Black 's new group and walked off into the jungle .
( " Sundown " )
Sayid traveled across the Island with the rest of the Man in Black 's group until they eventually set up camp in a clearing in a coastal forest .
Claire tried to kill Kate , who screamed for Sayid 's help , but he remained passive ; Sayid said he was incapable of feeling anything at all .
The Man in Black left the camp in his care , and Widmore 's men shot him with a dart .
The next day Sayid and the Man in Black traveled to Hydra Island .
Sayid remained behind , killed two men and took their prisoner - Desmond ( " Ab Aeterno " ) ( " The Package " ) ( " Happily Ever After " )
He delivered the prisoner to the Man in Black , who later dropped him in a well and asked Sayid to kill him .
He disobeyed when Desmond suggested killing him might disappoint the very person Sayid joined the Man in Black to gain .
( " Everybody Loves Hugo " ) ( " The Last Recruit " )
Sayid turned off the Hydra Island power generator , deactivating the sonic fence and letting the Man in Black free Hurley 's group from a cage .
Sayid then rejoined the group in the jungle and helped shoot Widmore 's men as the group commandeered his submarine .
In the sub , Jack discovered a bomb , and Sayid analyzed it , using his munitions knowledge one last time .
Sawyer then accidentally activated the bomb .
Sayid told Jack Desmond 's location and told him he'd replace Jacob then carried the bomb away from the others to the back of the submarine .
The bomb exploded , killing him .
( " The Candidate " )
Post - death
Flash sideways
Sayid was a former Republican Guard torturer and worked for an oil company .
He flew to Los Angeles to see Nadia , but believing he did n't deserve her , he'd " pushed " her to his brother Omer , who were now married with children .
Sayid and Nadia receive news about Omer at the hospital . ( " Sundown " )
Aboard Flight 815 , Sayid kicked in a lavatory door to help a flight attendant and save a passenger who'd locked himself inside .
He ran into a fellow passenger at baggage claim the took a cab to Nadia and Omer 's house , where he met them and their two children Eva and Sam .
A call took Omer from dinner early , and the children , looking for presents , found a picture of Nadia in Sayid 's bag .
That night , Omer asked his help against loan sharks , capitalizing on Sayid 's feelings for Nadia .
As in life , his love for Nadia pushed him toward violence , but Sayid told Omer he was " not that man " anymore .
The next day , Omer was attacked , and Nadia urged Sayid not to take revenge .
The men responsible came to Sayid though and brought him to a restaurant to meet the loan shark - Martin Keamy .
Keamy tried to get him to pay Omer 's debt , but Sayid used one of the men as a human shield then shot Keamy and the other henchman .
Leaving , he found a prisoner in the freezer , and after some thought , he gave him a box cutter to free himself .
A camera caught him fleeing the carnage , and the tape eventually reached the LAPD ( " LA X , Parts 1 & 2 " ) ( " Sundown " ) ( " The Package " ) ( " The Last Recruit " )
Sayid returned to Omer and Nadia 's house and packed to flee .
Nadia asked what he had done , then a police detective knocked on the door .
Sayid ran out the back door but Det. James
Ford tripped him up , held him at gunpoint and arrested him .
He met Desmond Hume while in custody .
Later , while Sayid , Desmond , and Kate Austen were being brought from holding to prison , Desmond offers to help him escape in exchange for a future favor .
Sayid agreed with facetious gravity .
The escorting officer freed them , and Hugo Reyes arrived , handing her a bribe .
Hurley then drove Sayid to the Flightline Motel and offered him a tranquilizer gun to remind him of their previous adventures there .
Sayid refused .
Hurley abducted a victim and they drove next to a bar 's parking lot .
Two men emerged from a bar fighting , followed by a woman who fell to the ground .
Sayid ran to her aid , and as they touched , they remembered each other and their lives .
Overjoyed that they had found each other , Shannon and Sayid shared a passionate kiss .
They went next to the church and sat together as a bright light covered them .
( " The Last Recruit " ) ( " What They Died For " ) ( " The End " )
Character analysis
Of all the survivors , Sayid is the one who committed the most crimes , from torture to murder .
He does so almost always in cold blood , or out of anger ( when he avenged his wife . )
He is often brought to violence and does n’t hesitate to kill in order to protect or avenge .
He also tortured many characters , and ( ironically ) showed genuine fear when he was tortured himself .
Despite his brutal nature , he was usually impeccably polite and courteous and was a passionate man who protected his loved ones .
Still , Sayid has absolutely no pride in his acts .
He tries to fight his murderous nature and seeks redemption through helping people as much he can , and therefore played a major role in the series .
Sayid tried to put his past behind him numerous times but just ca n’t wash the blood off his hands .
Nevertheless , he acted very sociably and politely to his mates , and when he could n’t suppress his violence , tried to put it to their advantage .
After contracting the sickness , Sayid stated that he could n’t feel anything : pain , anger , etc. ; he had an even easier time killing and was emotionless .
Yet , he proved that his humanity did n’t disappear : he spared Desmond and sacrificed himself for his friends .
Skills
If Jack is a man of science , and Locke is a man of faith , Sayid is a combination of the two .
He believes in facts and evidence but is driven by faith in his own intuition .
Sayid is portrayed as a man of many skills .
The importance of his skills , primarily , comes from its role in the storyline , in which it is often employed in revealing new secrets of the Island .
Many times , a secret was unfolded , as a result of an event triggered by one of these skills .
Through the introduced secrets , new threads in the storyline are created that eventually help in its development .
Muslim faith
Sayid is Muslim , though how devout is uncertain .
It seems , however , that his faith is a strong factor in helping him atone for what he did in his past .
On the Island , he is seen occasionally practicing a number of Islamic rituals or taking faith - inspired actions .
( " Live Together , Die Alone , Part 1 " )
He is seen praying Shahada L? ilaha illal - L?h , Muhammadun ras?lula - L?h
( " There is no god but Allah , Muhammad is the Messenger of God " ) when he is tied upside down .
( " Solitary " )
Whether Sayid 's faith would play a role in the coming events , and complement that played by Locke or Mr. Eko , is still a matter of question .
The issue of how devout he is has been made unclear by a few lines .
In " I Do " , he says to Locke " I believe in what I can see " concerning the existence of " the Monster " .
While he is clearly religious , he often seems skeptical of characters such as Locke and Mr. Eko , their faith in the Island , and how significant some of the more fantastical happenings are .
Contradicting his Islamic faith ( and his dedication to Nadia ) , Sayid and Shannon have premarital sex , which is forbidden in Islam .
As well , he is seen drinking MacCutcheon whisky in a bar prior to meeting Ilana , also forbidden in Islam .
He once again was about to have sex with Ilana before she apprehended him .
( " He 's Our You " )
In addition , after Nadia is struck by a car when crossing the street ( " The Incident , Part 1 " ) , he is seen wearing a gold ring , which is also forbidden in Islam .
According to Islam , men should not wear anything gold .
Additional casting
Anthony Keyvan played a young Sayid in " He 's Our You " .
In the casting call he was described as " Young boy , 8 , must speak Arabic .
Quiet and thoughtful who loves his older brother and is protective of him , can do what his father asks calmly and coolly . " [ 1 ]

The professional StarCraft community in South Korea is up in arms over reports of match - fixing and illegal betting .
StarCraft is a big deal in Korea ; it gets played professionally and there are TV channels devoted to it , but reports of match - fixing and illegal betting have rocked the community , forcing some players into retirement .
The reports state that an unspecified number of professional StarCraft players rigged their matches in conjunction with illegal gambling groups , and also leaked their replays .
And it 's also not just current players that are involved , retired players and coaches are also implicated , and the e-sport organizers were said to have been aware of the problem .
South Korean human rights laws means that the names of those involved cannot be released , but the scandal is said to touch many of the country 's top StarCraft players and is being likened to the 1919 Black Sox scandal , where Chicago White Sox players were discovered to be throwing matches during the 1919 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds , which should give you some idea of how seriously StarCraft is taken in South Korea .

Now that everything has been properly prepped we can get to work on the paint itself .
First , you will need to mix your paint .
The mix should be 50 % paint and 50 % mineral spirits .
This will produce a product with the consistency of milk .
You want it nice and runny , but with a little body still .
Too thin and you will have drips all over your car which will only add to the sanding work we are trying to avoid .
Too thick and it will take longer to dry then we want .
I found the best way to do this was to pour half of the paint can into another container .
Then , add the mineral spirits to the remaining paint in the can .
Mix it well and you are good to go !
Now , you need to determine how you are going to go about painting the car .
It is wise to paint each coat in the same manner to make sure you do not lose track of where you have laid paint already .
Plus this makes things go a little smoother all in all .
Here is a quick breakdown of how I went about painting my car : Started with the top of the car , passenger side then moved to the driver 's side - passenger side of the hood - then the driver 's side of the hood - back to the passenger fender - passenger side of the car until I got to the door - up the small strip of door across the top of the door and back down the the rear fender 's top - back to the front of the side of the car all the way back to the rear of the passenger side - trunk lid and spoiler - driver 's side rear fender till the door - up the door trim again to the front of the car - back to the rear of the driver 's side and forward to the fender - driver 's fender and done !
Essentially it was a clockwise circle around the car starting at the passenger side of the hood .
Except once I was done with one side of the hood or the roof , I jumped to the other side to finish .
Keep in mind that this is what worked out best for me and my car .
There are deep body lines between the roof and the rest of the car making it easy for me to paint it as a " separate piece " .
As I begin to explain the painting technique , you will see why it is important to keep applying paint to the car in some sort of order .
Letting one area dry with an edge left undone and then coming back to it will only create paint lines in your final product .
Your only break points should be at the edge of the car 's body .
Like between the fender and door , or the door and the roof .
Now we are ready to apply paint .
Pour some of your well mixed paint into a paint tray and let 's get started .
For large areas of the car I used a 4 " brush to apply the paint .
For large , even flat spots such as the hood or the trunk you will want to get a lot of paint on the brush .
I usually dipped the brush into the paint until the angled tip of the brush was completely submerged .
Now simply start to paint it onto the car .
The key here is in the technique .
Proper use of the brush is what helps to eliminate any brush strokes or orange peel .
First , lay on some paint , pretty thick , to an area .
Always make sure to paint one decent sized area at a time .
Spread the paint out a bit to cover the area you are working on .
Now , that you have a good base to work with , simply run the brush over the area you have well spread paint .
Just use the weight of the brush itself and slowly glide over the paint making sure to always stroke in the same direction .
This final smooth roll over the paint is what helps to eliminate any weird drying patterns .
Moving on to the next section make sure to spread a little bit of new paint over the edge of the area you just painted to ensure smooth even coverage .
As you move through the project , make sure to take a look back frequently to areas you have just painted to look for any drips or sagging areas .
If spotted , simply give them a quick brush over .
Lay down three coats of paint this way allowing at least 6 hours of dry time between coats .
( Pics 1 & 2 )
Here is a link to a video of me laying down some paint to help illustrate the technique .
It is not the best video , but it should help you grasp the process better .

Paint Application Technique ]
Once you have 3 layers of paint down bust out the hose and the sandpaper .
Give everything a good wet sand session again at 600 grit .
Keep in mind that you are not trying to create a completely smooth surface again , but to take out any major bumps and to rough up the paint some .
If you see areas with a bit of dripping , sagging or any other mess , just sand them down accordingly .
This is your chance to correct any imperfections in your paint job as well .
If you are happy with the way the 3rd coat looks as it stands and there are no drips or imperfections ... feel free to skip the sanding .
Now that your base has been put on and you have given it a decent sand we can start on the final few coats .
I say few because the amount of coats will vary on a few factors .
Did you need excessive sanding due to a problem area ?
Are you changing colors ?
Are you happy with the look after 2 coats ?
Well , that would be a good place to start ... at two coats .
Then move to three if need be .
Four if you really must .
If you pass four coats after your first session of sanding , you will want to give another quick sanding session to the paint before moving on .
This time move up a bit in paper grit though .
800 or 1000 will do .
( Pics 3 & 4 )
At this point you should be done !
The paint will have its own gloss to it as it is natural to the Rustoleum paint .
Feel free to wax the paint to help bring out some extra shine .
I would wait one full day before washing or waxing the paint though to be safe .
The Rustoleum can says it dries in 24 hours , but since we have diluted it so much it will dry a lot quicker .
I had about 12 hours between coats .
But if you are doing this in warm weather , you should easily be able to get 2 coats on the car in one day with an early start .
Once you have laid on all of the coats you want to and are happy with the final result , let the paint dry for at least 12 hours .
I finished the final coat at about 6:00 pm and began putting the car back together the next morning at 10:00 am .
If you are not happy with the look , continue to sand the paint progressively increasing the paper grit .
Start at about 800 or 1000 and move to 1500 , then even 2000 or 2500 .
Once the paint is totally sanded smooth , polish the car with a power spin buffer and the gleam will come back but be smooth as butter .
You can refer to the 50 Dollar Paint Job for more in depth information about the sanded finish technique .
I am happy with how it looks wihtout the sanding , so I stopped here .
A brand new sneak peek look at the beginning of the first big battle with new villain Whiplash ( Mickey Rourke ) has been released to the public .
The fight scene showcases everything that makes an epic fight well …epic .
While debuting a new Formula One car , Ivan Vanko a.k.a.
Whiplash ambushes Tony ( Robert Downey Jr. ) on the race track , delivering punishment with his deadly Electro - Bullwhips .
Tony ’s driver Hogan and secretary Pepper Potts are trapped in the near vicinity ( hope they gets hazard pay ) and Tony is forced to don his new experimental Suitcase Armor to deal with this new and staggeringly powerful menace .
Rourke delivers the goods as Whiplash , showcasing his incredible physique in the battle and the Suitcase Suit gets a sweet mechanized upgrade for the film .
I ’m not a big fan of the Silver Centurion era ( the silver and red color scheme ) but nonetheless , the Battlin ’ Tin Can looks in fine form .
That is until Whiplash proves a bit more than meets the eye .
We quickly witness that Ole ’ Shellhead must still earn his stripes to become the Iron Man we all have come to love .
Whiplash obviously intends to see to it that that never happens .
A supreme battle between two epic juggernauts ( no pun intended ) .
Whiplash never got much credit in the comics ( lets face it , he was laughable at best trying to take on the toughest member of the Avengers ) but this awesome fight preview has finally allowed me to forgive the combining of his story line with The Crimson Dynamo ’s in order to make him a more interesting baddie .
Marvel Studios has struck gold and with director John Favreau ’s announcement that the film will have no cliffhangers , let ’s hope the rest of the sequel is just as phenomenal .
Guess we ’ll find out May 7th !

Goldman Sachs ’ top executives were aware that the company made money by playing against the US housing market , according to internal e-mails released Saturday .
The bank ’s chief executive Lloyd Blankfein wrote in November 2007 that the firm “ did n’t dodge the mortgage mess , ” but “ made more than we lost ” by betting against the housing market , the Associated Press reported .
ADVERTISEMENT
The e-mail was one of several company documents subpoenaed by a Senate investigations panel .
In many of the e-mails , Goldman executives brag about money they were making as the market crashed around them .
One Goldman
Sachs trader wrote in e-mails to a woman he apparently was courting that investments he had sold were “ like Frankenstein turning against his own inventor . ”
In another e-mail , the same trader dismissed the debts created for the bank as “ pure intellectual masturbation . ”
“ I ’m trading a product which a month ago was worth $ 100 and today is only worth $ 93 , ” wrote Fabrice Tourre , who was charged along with the bank in a civil complaint filed this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
“ That does n’t seem like a lot but when you take into account … ( the investments ) are worth billions , well it adds up to a lot of money . ”
The documents seem to contradict Goldman ’s denials that it profited from the subprime mortgage meltdown by secretly betting that housing prices would fall .
At the same time , Goldman was selling tens of billions of dollars in risky mortgage securities .
Goldman Sachs , the world ’s largest investment bank , was the only major Wall Street firm to escape much of the subprime crash that triggered a world - wide economic meltdown .
ADVERTISEMENT
The company now says that it only bet against the market for the sake of its clients .
According to media reports , the bank is already preparing a detailed defense against accusations that it intentionally misled the public and therefore shares guilt for the economic crisis .
The supposedly 11 - page - long document will be used by Blankfein when he testifies Tuesday in front of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations .

The e-mails are only the latest scandal that will help Democrats push financial reform through Congress , according to New York Times columnist Frank Rich .
He added , however , that it remains uncertain how much influence the banks ’ lobbyists will exert over the legislation :
ADVERTISEMENT
Salutary as this rush of events is , it still adds up so far to just one small step for mankind .
We do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t yet know how many loopholes lobbyists will slip into the bill - in - progress .
We donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t yet know the outcome of the S.E.C. case , let alone what other much - needed legal pursuit of Wall Street may follow it .
And we still do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t know what , if any , true correction lies ahead for the financial sectorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s runaway casino culture Ã¢â‚¬â€ much of it legal Ã¢â‚¬â€ that turned a subprime - mortgage bubble in a handful of overheated American states into an international economic meltdown .
The state Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to review a lower court ruling in a lawsuit over gruesome death - scene photos leaked by the California Highway Patrol , clearing the way for a possible jury trial in the case .
The lawsuit , brought by the Catsouras family of Ladera Ranch , accuses the CHP and two of its employees of negligence and violating the family ’s right to privacy by causing graphic crash photos of Nikki Catsouras , 18 , to go viral on the Internet .
In declining to review the Jan. 29 ruling by the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana , the state Supreme Court also denied the CHP ’s request for “ de- publication ” of the opinion .
That means the ruling will remain as binding new case law throughout California concerning the privacy rights of surviving family members when it comes to death images of a decedent .
Previously , under state law , surviving family members had no right of privacy “ in the context of written media discussing , or pictorial media portraying , the life of a decedent , ” according to the appellate court decision .
“ We are ecstatic that the California Supreme Court , the highest court in the state , agrees with our position and that of the 4th Appellate , ” Catsouras family attorneys Keith G. Bremer and Tyler D. Offenhauser , of Bremer Whyte Brown & O’Meara in Newport Beach , said in a statement .
“ We look forward to confronting the CHP for their egregious conduct . ”
The CHP does not comment on litigation .
In a previously released statement , the agency called the accident “ tragic ” and its aftermath a “ difficult , unfortunate situation . ”
Attorneys for the CHP and its two employees , Aaron Reich and Thomas O’Donnell , have the right to appeal their case to the U.S. Supreme Court , but Bremer said he expects the decision to stand and the lawsuit to proceed toward a settlement or jury trial in the coming months .
Jon R. Schlueter , Reich ’s attorney , could not be reached for comment .
Alexander R. Wheeler , O’Donnell ’s attorney , said : “ Mr. O’DonnellÂ looks forward to getting past the plaintiffs ’ outrageous allegations and to the truth .
“ Up until now , the courts have been limited to the plaintiffs ’ sensational story .
Â Mr. O’Donnell is confident that once we get to the truth , he will get back his good name .
“ Let ’s also remember what this lawsuit is really about : the plaintiffs are asking for $ 20 million in damages from California taxpayers and from Mr. O’Donnell . ” Â Â Â
Reich and O’Donnell , through their attorneys , previously have maintained they meant no harm to the Catsouras family .
The CHP dispatchers have said they sent the images to warn family and friends about the dangers of speeding and driving under the influence , although Nikki Catsouras was not found to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs when she crashed .
Catsouras , a graduate of Tesoro High School and an aspiring photographer with three younger sisters , was killed in an automobile accident on Oct. 31 , 2006 .
She died after taking her father ’s Porsche without her parents ’ permission .
She lost control driving more than 100 mph on the 241 toll road in Lake Forest , slamming into an unmanned toll station .
Several days later , graphic photos of her remains began appearing on Web sites , eventually spreading to more than 2,500 sites worldwide , according to court documents .
The images , some accompanied by taunting messages , also were sent anonymously to her parents , Christos and Lesli Catsouras , in emails .
The CHP later apologized to the Catsouras family after admitting that Reich and O’Donnell emailed the images to their friends and relatives for apparent shock valued on Halloween .
The Catsouras family sued , but in March 2008 , Orange County Superior Court Judge Steven L. Perk dismissed the lawsuit – a decision the appellate court reversed in January .
“ The alleged acts ( of the CHP ) were morally deficient , ” the appellate court said in its 64 - page opinion .
“ It is a sad day , to be sure , when those upon whom we rely to protect and serve do the opposite , and make the decapitated corpse of a teenage girl the subject of international gossip and disrespect , and inflict devastating emotional harm on the parents and siblings of that girl , ” the ruling said .
“ The CHP should know better .
Every one of its officers should know better .
The CHP is in a position to ensure that this does not happen again . ”

In continuing our Stock Your Thai Pantry series , one item that must be mentioned is Sriracha sauce ( ซ้อสศรีราชา ) — the all - purpose hot sauce that , according to the most prominent yet unsubstantiated theory , originated from a city after which it was named .
I ca n’t think of any hot sauce that is more widely used and versatile when it comes to the modern Thai cuisine .
Even though Sriracha has become a generic name for similar hot sauces made both domestically and outside of Thailand , the Thai palates do n’t have a hard time recognizing the authentic spicy , sweet , tangy , garlicky sauce that we grew up with .
Folks seem a bit touchy when the subject of Sriracha ( what ’s authentic and what ’s not , whether the name should be used to call non-Thai products , etc. ) is brought up .
So I will try my best to write this post in the most just - the - fact - ma ’am way as I possibly can .
It has been suggested that Sriracha sauce is a sauce made according to a tradition begun in and around the city of Si Racha ( อำเภอศรีราชา ) , a Thai eastern province of Chonburi ( จังหวัดชลบุรี ) — hence the name .
But this has yet to be substantiated .
Regardless , what we do know is that it is a sauce that originated from and has been heavily used in Thailand .
The sauce is traditionally made of fresh larger red peppers or พริกชี้ฟ้า ( never dried peppers and usually not small bird ’s eye ones or พริกขี้หนู ) , vinegar ( white only — never rice or cider vinegar ) , garlic , sugar , and salt .
It should also be noted that Sriracha sauce never contains tomatoes .
1
Additionally , Sriracha always has smooth texture ; it ’s never chunky .
When you look at it , you should not see pepper seeds or chunks of pepper skin .
The sauce , as we know it in Thailand , does not have the texture of sambal — a sauce which , though delicious , should not be confused with Sriracha .
Thai Sriracha , according to my observation , is runnier and sweeter than the US - made Sriracha .
The flavor lends itself very well to Thai dishes , especially those that can sometimes be a bit on the greasy side .
( The heat and the tang help restore the balance . )
I drizzle it on Thai omelet , turn it into a dipping sauce or a dipping sauce base , make a stir - fry sauce or marinade out of it , and use it as a barbecue sauce .
There are many other ways to use Thai Sriracha which I will mention here in future posts .
Strain , but do n’t overdo it ; let some of the fine pulp go through the mesh to give the sauce body .

As an aside , to clear up the issue once and for all , the correct pronunciation of Sriracha , as recognized by literate native speakers of the Thai languageis see - rah - chah .
Why make your own Sriracha ?
After all — not that I ’ve ever conducted a nationwide poll — most Thai people do n’t make their own Sriracha in much the same way as how Americans do n’t normally make their own ketchup .
But I , personally3 , make my own Sriracha , because :
I can .
Anyone can .
I want to .
It ’s kind of fun .
I can adjust the seasoning to taste .
I know exactly what goes into my food .
It ’s more economical .
The flavor is bolder and fresher ; the pepper and the garlic pack more punch .
One 32 - ounce batch lasts a long time .
It can even be frozen .
I have a killer recipe in my hand .
( It comes from an unidentified source who does not wish that his name be made public . )
Let ’s just say , if the dominant brands in the US market , namely Shark and Sriraja Panich , had a love child , it would taste like this .
For those who seek to replicate Huy Fong Sriracha , aka the rooster sauce , you ’ll be disappointed by this recipe .
This formula is for the kind of Sriracha sauce that we use in Thailand .
Print Prep time 15 mins
Cook time 15 mins Total time 30 mins Author : Leela Recipe type : Condiment , Sauce Serves : 1 quart ( 32 fluid ounces ) Ingredients 24 ounces ( weight ) fresh red jalapeño or serrano peppers , no substitute
8 ounces ( weight ) peeled garlic cloves
4 fluid ounces white vinegar
12 fluid ounces water
16 ounces ( weight ) granulated sugar
6 tablespoons salt ( You can add more — up to 8 tablespoons — if it ’s not salty enough , but it ’s better to start with less . )
Instructions Purée the first four ingredients together in a blender ; strain the liquid into a heavy - bottomed pot , squeezing out as much liquid out of the pulp as you possibly can .
It 's important that you do n't use a strainer with too fine mesh as you want to incorporate some pulp into the sauce .
It 's some of the fine pulp that passes through the strainer that gives the sauce body .
If there 's no pulp at all in the strained mixture , you 'll end up with a hot , sweet , sticky syrup with may not taste so bad but it will lack the consistency of Thai Sriracha .
Whisk the rest of the ingredients into the pepper - garlic purée and bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat , stirring occasionally .
Reduce the heat and let the sauce simmer , uncovered , until the sauce is reduced down to about 4 cups and thickened up a bit , stirring occasionally .
If you like your sauce less runny , reduce it longer ; the recipe will yield less volume , but the sauce will be thicker and more intense .
Let the sauce cool completely before storing in a glass jar .
If you do n’t stick a dirty spoon into the jar every time you use your sauce , your Sriracha will keep , refrigerated , for a month .
It can also be frozen and thawed in the refrigerator .
The sauce tastes best if left in the refrigerator for two days after it was made to allow the flavor to mellow out a bit .
From that point on , the garlic is n’t quite so strong and the pepper is n’t quite so harsh and fiery .

1 Sriracha must not be confused with spicy tomato ketchup which is also commercially available in Thailand , though not nearly as popular or delicious , in my opinion .
2 Ignore the first R ; it ’s merely an unvocalized remnant of the original Sanskrit .
All three syllables are open ( CV ) with clear breaks between them and must be pronounced in such a way that indicates these breaks ( in other words , not SIR - otch -ah ) .

Recent attention has focused on the " push to oversimplify " at the IPCC , especially in connection with its 2007 report that announced " unequivocal " evidence of man-made global warming .
That report , which has been shown to contain numerous fabrications and distortions of evidence , has been increasingly challenged by prominent climate scientists .
Former lead author of the agency 's 2001 report John Christy has suggested that pressure of various kinds was exerted to oversimplify IPCC findings , especially in connection with the infamous " hockey stick " theory .
Anyone familiar with the history of the environmental movement would not be surprised by these revelations .
The idea that leading scientists would engage in distortion and removal of data , selective use of evidence , suppression of dissenting views , and public relations tactics worthy of Steve Jobs might seem hard to grasp , but ever since the founding of the modern - day environmental movement , this activist approach has been the norm .
The first major figure to enlist in the service of ecological activism was Rachel Carson .
Although she was not a research scientist , Carson possessed a remarkable talent for communicating scientific knowledge to the general reader .
Her first two books were straightforward narratives that vividly conveyed the secrets of ocean life and shore life to a mass - reading public .
In Carson 's last book , however , a dramatic change of perspective occurred -- a change signaled by the book 's provisional title , Man Against the Earth .
That book , ultimately published under the title Silent Spring , did not simply mirror the scientific literature concerning the effect of DDT and other chemicals on the environment .
It took a controversial stand advocating the ultimate elimination of all man-made pesticides , and it backed up its position with a selective and oversimplified use of evidence .
It was the first widely disseminated environmentalist tract , but it would not be the last .
As Mark Hamilton Lytle pointed out in his biography of Carson , The Gentle Subversive ( New York , 2007 ) , " reducing " the data " to terms that general readers could understand " ( page 150 ) was a major consideration in the composition of Silent Spring .
Carson 's book , in fact , not only simplified , but biased the argument with its selective treatment of the scientific literature .
As an advocate for political action rather than an objective science writer , Carson implied the existence of a consensus where none existed .
It was not just Carson 's desire to reach a broad reading public that was at stake , however .
Carson had enlisted her writing in the service of a growing political movement that employed public relations attacks , lawsuits , and calls for legislative restrictions on chemical and industrial companies .
From the beginning , these efforts displayed a tendency to rely on biased , incomplete , or purely theoretical science .
While Carson herself was relatively prudent in her claims -- even suggesting that DDT might have a limited usefulness in certain situations -- those who followed in her footsteps became increasingly radical .
Later books such as Molly Bang 's Common Ground : The Water , Earth , and Air We Share and You Are Here : Exposing the Vital Link Between What We Do and What That Does to Our Planet speak freely of " global catastrophe " and " irreparable harm . "
Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth is a particularly egregious example of this willingness to subordinate science to political ends .
The public relations maneuvering behind Earth Day , first celebrated in 1970 , is another example of the acquiescence of science to politics .
Originating in the office of Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin , Earth Day was promoted by an organized cadre of political aides , media , and environmental groups .
It was far from being a spontaneous , grassroots welling - up of national concern , as depicted at the time .
Convinced that the very survival of the planet is at stake , ecological activists seem to believe that practically all means of resistance are justified .
In the case of ELF ( the violence - prone Environmental Liberation Front ) , this conviction led to several deaths and the destruction of millions of dollars of property .
Yet those who eschew violence have also destroyed lives and property , in some cases on a massive scale .
In his novel State of Fear , Michael Crichton depicted environmentalism as a fanatical pseudo - religion -- a view that is not far from the truth .
Others have estimated the damage of withholding DDT from developing nations in their fight against malaria and insect - related crop damage .
It is impossible to know precisely how many human beings have died because of the reluctance of western aid agencies to fund DDT , but certainly the number runs into the millions .
All of this brings us back to the admitted oversimplification and other failures of the IPCC reports and of the underlying scientific literature upon which they are based .
It is important to understand that the mistakes in the 2001 and 2007 IPCC reports are not " lapses " or minor errors :
They are the tip of an iceberg of bogus science .
There is simply no conclusive evidence that the earth 's glaciers are melting , the oceans rising , or storms increasing in intensity as a result of anthropogenic warming .
Even Phil Jones , the British scientist at the center of Climategate , now admits that the medieval period was warmer than the present :
How could the medieval period , which ended five hundred years before the invention of the internal combustion engine , have been warmer than the past hundred years if it is fossil fuels that are responsible for global warming ?
Ever since Rachel Carson decided to enlist her talents in the service of an activist agenda , an unholy alliance has existed among scientists on the one side and politicians , bureaucratic institutions , investigative journalists , and partisan non-profit agencies on the other .
Working together , they have advanced the anti-growth agenda of environmental regulation , but they have done so at the expense of scientific truth .
The earth 's inhabitants are asked to forgo their prosperity , security , and even survival on the basis of an inconclusive and doubtful scientific " consensus . "
The public is now aware of the fact that it has been conned , and it is time to move toward the next logical step : the undoing of millions of pages of laws , regulations , and restrictions on those industries upon which life and well - being depend .

The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig and the estimated 42,000 gallons of oil gushing daily from an underwater well into Gulf of Mexico waters are providing fresh fodder for congressional foes of offshore drilling .
They have seized on the disaster as evidence that offshore drilling threatens the environment , human life , fishing industries and coastal states ' tourism dollars .
The success of the massive recovery and containment mission now under way will influence the near - term future of offshore drilling , said Ken Medlock , a fellow in energy economics at Rice University 's Baker Institute for Public Policy .
Possible outcomes include a decision by the Obama administration to shelve some offshore lease proposals or stalled congressional plans for expanded drilling .
ï¿½It really does depend on how bad this gets , ï¿½ Medlock said .
ï¿
½If this drags out for monthsï¿½ and oil starts affecting ï¿½local businesses that rely on marine life , it 's not just an issue of environmental costs .
It also becomes a very real issue of economic costs .ï¿½
ï¿ ½Up in arms '
Sen. Bill Nelson , D - Fla. , a longtime drilling opponent , said conservative business leaders ï¿½all along the Gulf Coast ï¿½ are up in arms and alarmed now and are scared to death that oil is moving toward them ï¿½ ï¿½ and that fear is growing among state politicians and on Capitol Hill .
ï¿½If this thing keeps leaking a thousand barrels of oil a day ( for months ) it will drive a stake in the heart of drilling close to shore , ï¿½ Nelson said .
ï¿½The fear and the panic that has been engendered as a result of this catastropheï¿½ could erode congressional support for new offshore drilling .
The issue is likely to spill over into a possible Senate debate later this year on combating climate change and revamping U.S. energy policy .
Senators negotiating a broad climate change and energy bill have included expanded offshore drilling in the plan in an effort to lure enough support from Republicans and oil - patch Democrats to pass the legislation .
For instance , the measure is expected to give coastal states the power to allow drilling in waters as far as 35 miles out from their shorelines ï¿½ compared to the typical three - mile boundary .
The legislation also could give more coastal states a chance to collect lucrative royalty revenue from nearby offshore drilling .
If even a few senators withdraw their support from the bill because of the drilling issue , the whole compromise could unravel .
ï¿
½This might actually sway , at the margin , four or five Senate members , ï¿½ Medlock said , ï¿ ½and that may be all you need .ï¿½
Congress will play a key role in deciding whether to open up parts of the eastern Gulf of Mexico up for drilling leases .
Right now , the area is walled off under a statutory moratorium that would have to be lifted before the Obama administration could follow through on plans to allow new drilling there .
ï¿½That may be an area where this tragedy may come into play , ï¿½ said Michael Olsen , a lobbyist with Bracewell & Giuliani who spent five years as a deputy assistant secretary in the Interior Department .
ï¿½If the opponents of expanded drilling can drum up enough opposition among their colleagues , then , potentially , Congress wo n't have to lift that moratorium .ï¿½
ï¿½The other side '
Rep. Gene Green , D - Houston , a drilling advocate , said he has n't seen signs yet that the images of the fire - engulfed rig or oil - covered waters have caused fellow congressional supporters of offshore drilling to change their minds on the issue .
But he worries it could ï¿½give ammunition to the other side .ï¿½
ï¿½This is the first major spill since 1979 in the Gulf of Mexico ( and ) we have a really good history , ï¿½ Green said .
But ï¿ ½when you watch it on TV , every news cycle , it keeps on people 's minds .ï¿½
Although President Barack Obama last month proposed drilling along the Atlantic seaboard and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico , the Interior Department is at the very beginning stages of implementing the plan by accepting public comments on the scope of required environmental reviews .
Interior Department spokesman Kendra Barkoff said that before production could advance in new areas of the Gulf or Atlantic and Arctic oceans , the regions ï¿ ½will have to undergo thorough environmental analysis , public input and comment , scientific study and review and a careful examination of the potential risks and spill response capabilities in that area .ï¿½
The White House has not signaled it will change course on the drilling plan .
Sen. Robert Menendez , D - N.J. , a leading opponent of expanded ocean drilling , said he hopes the disaster will convince wavering colleagues about the potential risks of offshore energy production .

​​Oregon ’s marijuana legalization initiative , the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act ( OCTA ) , is kicking off its signature - gathering phase at the OR NORML meeting in Portland this Saturday , April 10 .
​ Petitions have just been approved for circulation by the Oregon Secretary of State ’s Office , and OCTA said it expects more than 300 attendees to be among the first to sign the petition for this historic ballot measure .
OCTA will generate revenue by taxing commercial cannabis sales , which will be permitted to adults 21 and older .
More than $ 140 million a year would be generated by OCTA for the state ’s General Fund , according to projections , paying for education , roads , health care , and other public projects .
“ OCTA will transform Oregon , ” said co-chief petitioner Madeleine Martinez , executive director of OR NORML .
“ Supporting OCTA is a no-brainer . ”
​ According to OCTA ’s other co-chief petitioner , Paul Stanford of The Hemp and Cannabis Foundation ( THCF ) , the potential of industrial hemp for Oregon ’s economy is limitless , as it will turn the state into a national leader in ecological innovation and sustainable jobs .
“ The entire hemp plant is useful , from its seeds which create a food source to its oil which can be made into bio - diesel to its stalks which can be woven into fabrics or turned into paper , ” Stanford said .
“ Hemp is the future , not just for Oregon , but for a sustainable planet . ”
The campaign said it will collect 125,000 signatures by July 2 in order to qualify for November ’s ballot .
OCTA has hired Democracy Resources , a Portland - based signature - gathering firm with a proven track record of success , to ensure the petition makes the ballot .
The campaign said it already has raised more than half the money required to fund a paid signature gathering effort .

A few hundred miles southeast of Iceland , 50,000 descendants of Vikings live on a string of craggy islands called the Faroes .
For more than 1,000 years , the people here have hunted pilot whales , and whale meat continues to be an important part of their diet .
But when pictures of whale hunts first appeared in the media during the 1980s , many from the outside world were shocked and animal rights activists mounted an anti-whaling campaign .
The protests eventually abated , partly because the Faroese are not involved in commercial whaling .
Yet , the islanders now face a new threat to their way of life : A landmark 20 - year study of Faroese children has found that high levels of methyl mercury and other contaminants in the whale meat are harmful to a child ’s neurological development .
FRONTLINE / World reporter Serene Fang explores how the study ’s findings have rubbed against deeply held traditions in this beautiful and remote part of the world .

Thank you very much for this film .
I thought it was a welcome break from the accusations we usually find ourself the center of .
Finally a non-Faroese effort to look objectively at what the whale tradition is to the Faroese .
All the best ,

Did anyone posting here watch the video beyond the whale hunt ?
The issue here is MERCURY .
I spent several months getting to know a woman from the Faroe Islands and learning their culture .
I met some of her visiting relatives .
Asking the Faroese to quit killing and eating whale is as preposterous as telling the Seminoles to quit killing and eating alligators .
How much farmable land did you see in the report ?
The smug ethnocentric judgements on their diet is a dumb distraction from the real danger from mercury poisoning .
Does anyone think that it 's OK for the whales to be full of mercury as long as no one kills them for food ?
Before the mercury contamination doctors from all over the world studied the Faroese and found them to be unusually healthy with the best teeth anywhere .
The diet could n't be that bad .

I 'm extremely disappointed with the reactions from other viewers .
The goal of this piece was not to question whether hunting whale was ethical .
We were shown that a very important part of Faroese culture is threatened due to pollution of the ocean by others thousands of miles away .
I find it disgusting that many feel that this contamination is merely a serendipitous means to ending the whale hunt .

You large nations can just keep dumping chemicals into the ocean , and no one can eat anything from the ocean at all .
Is it better to pollute whales and make their lives horrible , than give them a quick death ?
No matter if humans kill animals or not , there will always be a natural balance , that will make them die from something else ( like die from hunger , or eaten by other animals ) .

What is happening is not worse than what happenns in US slaughter houses .
If many Americans actually see how beef , pork and chicken are prepared before the meat get to the supermarket , less than 5 % of US population will ever eat meat again .
It is barbarous and inhuman , and it does not have to be so .
At least these Faroe Islanders , hunt and share among themselves .
In the US , the rich own the farms and slaughter houses , and the poor work to buy the dirty meat as food .
Who is kidding who ?

All cultures of this world are going to have to give up certain cultural practices in order to create sustainability .
I would not question the hunts if they used their historic row boats and spears .
The pacific Native Americans also hunt from culture ... one whale a year !
Soon all peoples are going to realize the cost of eating any animal is too much for our modern population numbers and ecosystems .

Something feels innately wrong about killing sea mammals .
However , I understand the cultural implications of the ' whale hunt ' to people of the Faroes .
This is a difficult subject for me to remain unbiased about , so Great Journalism !
I really liked the piece .

It 's nice to see that the decendants of the Barbaric Vikings are continuing to cull the innocents .
The ancestors of these modern day
Killers used to rape and pillage the weakest areas of my country and cull
the population in a murderous frenzy .
Those of Danish ancestry are proud of
their heritage of Babarism and I suppose feel strong because of it .
But listen you people of the Faroe Islands , this is the 21st century , do n't any of you think that we should be past doing these things of Medievil origin .
So Please , Please , Please stop this Murder of a highly intellegent species and
truly become a fellow European of whom we can be proud of .

I am repeating that Japanese killing whales , dolphins as a ritual or more cultural is total BS .
Danes , you are as insane as them and
to me these human traditions should be brutally slaughtered as the animals
were .
If it means going and reducing those places to rubbles , than so be it .
Just like Taiji Harbor in Japan , Faroe islands needs some face uplift for their dolphin killings .
Are there any airforce personnel willing to fly on this mission ?
Just make sure that these places will never be able to continue with the barbaric traditions .
We will make sure all innocent are rescued
before your flights .

The difference between slaughtering these whales and slaughtering cattle , chickens , fish etc is that animals are bred and farmed for the purpose of slaughter .
These whales are in the wild .
Thats like chopping down rain forests and not replanting new trees !
Also .. who do these whales belong to ???
The cattle and chicken etc. we eat are farmed by us .
But the people of the Faroes are taking the worlds whales for themselves .
Slaughtering whales for food does not bother me .
But if its more about the ' sport ' or tradition then I think it 's wrong .
Tradition or culture does not give certain places more rights than others .
What if we all decided to hunt whale like this ?
Who is monitoring numbers ?
Farm your whales the way the rest of the world farm their food !!!!
On a completely different note , obviously I think the rest of the world should take responsibility for their own pollution .
This is clearly a complicated and sensitive topic and I am merely expressing my opinion .
Very interesting documentary .
Oh , one more thing ..
In the rest of the world we do n't all get together in a sport like fashion and cull hundreds of cattle etc .
It is not a social practice which is probably why so many people think this is so shocking ; the enjoyment of killing these animals .
We prefer to turn our heads the other way instead of enjoying and participating in a bloody massacre .
We accept that we need to eat and we do so in a modest and respectful way .
We do n't fill a room with animals and release the whole village on them for kicks .

I am surprised .

This is barbaric to the rest of the world , but this is the Faroese ' people way of life for centuries .
My concern is because of the rest of the world 's polluting ways , we cannot allow the Faroese people to disappear due to Mercury Poisoning .
They have got to reduce the consumption of these whales ; and the rest of the world have to stop polluting our environment ; especially those developed countries ( In North America , lots of Mineral Mines - use Mercury in their operation , and a tailgate for the mercury , into nearby lakes )
Jackie Delaney

Our species has absolutely no right to inflict pain and suffering on other animals .
Excusing barbaric practices on the grounds that they are part of one 's culture is absurd .
Burning women alive , stoning women to death , beheadings , clitorendectomies and child marriage are all part of cultural practice in many countries .
Should these crimes be excused as part of a culture ?
Of course not .

To continue this type of ancestral tradition with high - speed and modern motor boats does not leave these pilot whales with any chance .
If Man does not respect Nature the day will come when these animals are gone and we will have nothing more to do but cry .

I think it is great they are hunting for their own food .
It is no worse than the deer hanging on a pole gutted and ready to be skinned and cut up for our winter meat supply ( our deer hunting party does well here in the northern Minnesota forests ) .
We do not do it with spears and ancient bows and arrows either .
We all get involved in the cutting and packaging of the meat and share with less fortunate families .
I am a viking descendant also and it is fun to see that some of us still talk and live in some ways like our ancestors .

How was the whale hunt conducted a 1000 years ago ?
I bet they did n't use boats with diesel engines .
If it is really about the tradition then maybe more care could be taken to perform the hunt in the way their ancestors did .

I traveled to the Faroe Islands on exchange for a year , and was lucky enough to see a whaling .
Yes , the people enjoy the whalings , because they are a vital part of tradition and culture for them and will continue to be .
The whales will never be hunted into extinction .
The pilot whales are actually overpopulated around the islands and eat the fish stocks which provide the main source of industry and income for the people in the Faroe Islands .
Also , the whale hunting , or grindadrap as it is called in Faroese , occurs only when herds of whales come near the islands .
Some years it will happen five or six times , and some years there will be no whale caught .
The killing of whales is incredibly humane , and much more so than harpooning ever was , and no profit is made from the meat , which is divided equally ( by the police ) between the attendees to the whaling and the population of the town in which it occurred .
For the record , I come from New Zealand , one of the most anti-whaling countries in the world , and I was able to not only understand , but enjoy the tradition .
Indeed , it was the most culturally rich experience I have ever had , and given the chance , I 'd do it again a hundred times over .
( Whale , by the way , is delicious . )

This clip was about MERCURY , and the effect it has on CHILDREN , not the ethics of whale hunting .

I noticed one post asked whether the Faroese could n't just " go to their supermarkets and buy chicken " then mentioned how cattle is raised commercially .
Other posts asked if the Faroese could n't just give up whale meat .
Could Americans give up beef ?
Have any of these critics seen where their chicken and beef comes from ?
Have you seen the feed lots in this country , where cattle are packed so tightly together in their own filth that they cannot even sit down ?
Have you not heard of how cattle have their skulls bashed in after being electrically shocked ?
Have you not read about how chickens are crammed into cages one on top of the other unable to stand , just so more meat can be packed into those plastic wrapped containers in your supermarket ?
I do not like seeing any animal suffer , but at least the whales have had long free lives and relatively quick deaths .
They are n't cruelly raised in small tanks for mass consumption .
Perhaps Frontline should do an expos on American feed lots and chicken farming .
The slaughter of the pilot whales in the Faroe Islands is not in excess -- I really appreciate how the meat is shared .
The rise in pollutants ( the true point of the story ) is indeed alarming .
The thought that we in the rest of the world , are poisoning people we 'll never meet is disturbing , and I 'm sure the Faroese are n't the only ones affected .
FRONTLINE / World 's editors respond :
Thank you for your comments .
Frontline did explore some of the serious probelms you mention in a documentary called " Modern Meat " .

Why should the Faroe Islands stop whaling if the US slaughter houses slit poor cows and pigs throats .
Until the US gives up its in - humane slaughter house the Faroes do n't have to give up whaling .

Reading the title to this video I thought that it was going to be about some kind of treasure hunt or a long lost clue that helped discover something great , instead I had to watch the massacre of one hundred and thirty whales .
I think that the people of this island are horrible and need to forget about their old and harmful cultural ideas .
They need to become part of this century .
I understand that they are proud to have kept a tradition dating back thousands of years , but the changing views of the world have labeled them as barbaric .
They need to stop killing the whales before somebody makes them stop .
As for the mercury levels affecting child development , I believe that that is just another reason swaying the people of the island to stop eating whale meat .
Perhaps the Faroe Islands will not kill as many whales or stop all together because of this new development .
Kelly
Dallas , Texas
Watching this video , I was surprisingly not as disturbed as I anticipated to be .
Although the killing of these whales was inhumane , I feel that people must do what they can to survive .
I do n't understand how people can so strongly disagree with the killing of these whales , seeing as how we eat chicken , cow , lamb , duck etc . and they are all killed specifically for the grocery store .
Killing whales for food is completely different than killing an animal for its fur , or for its tusks .
The Faroese will continue to eat whale and continue their tradition , so I will continue to support them in their way of life .

There are some serious untruths involved in the Frontline treatment of mercury " pollution " .
Aqueous mercury sources are common among volcanoes , eroding granite , and oceanic thermal vents environments , and concentrates as methyl mercury , a toxin , in high chain predator sea creatures .
It is found in sea harvests from Iceland , Hawaii , the South Pacific , and many waters none of which are highly industrial environs .
The Seychelles study fundamentally contradicts the Faroe study in that no detrimental effects were discovered with massive long - term intake of mercury .
( See : http://whyfiles.org/201mercury/3.html)
Moreover , for two centuries dentists have used almost pure mercury to make permanent fillings , for hundreds of millions of patients , with no known detrimental effects .
People with " silver " fillings have orders of magnitude ( 500 X ) more mercury in their bodies than EPA limits for water ingestion .
( See http://www.cfsn.com/dental.html)
The level of science on this " Pollutant " is very poor .
Until basic correlations can withstand technical scrutiny , common sense , it is simply ignorant fear mongering to link a naturally occurring trace metal with health issues related to an ancient human activity , fishing .
Journalists are not far from witch doctors .
Both make a living , reporting on the boogeyman .

I am with Cohen on this one .
If this is a huge part of the Faroese culture , then why not do it as your ancestors did ?
And more upsetting to me was the fact that everyone seemed to enjoy the slaughter of these sentient , intelligent creatures , children included .
If an animal gives its life to keep you alive , should you not at least show a little RESPECT for the dead / dying creature ?

The video was very interesting .
Learning traditional practices that still continue , yet we have to adapt to what we deal with everyday .
New regulations and new sicknesses .
[ Allowing ] chasing [ of the whales ] could be an outlet for traditional practice but killing , may be stopped , if possible .

I have been recently to the Faroes and met the people .
I have read the IWC reports on Faroese whaling and they take such a minute number of pilot whales that according to the IWC , it is insignificant .
So the important issue is not the whales they take but the pollution destroying the viability of the sea .

It is important to see how this culture affirms the bond it has had for a millenia .
The Faroese truly care about their community and the people in it .
True , the tradition will have to move into a symbolic festival , rather than a ritual mass slaughter , either out of regulation , respect for sustainable life or by a shameful extinction .
I hope the doctor 's warning is heeded .
The health concerns at present ( human and marine life ) should outwiegh the provisional concerns of the past .

Just because they have been eating whale for centuries does n't justify the brutality of the whole thing .
Are n't they an advanced society now ?
Can they go to their supermarkets and buy chicken ?
Many cultures used to eat any and all sorts of wild game until many were hunted to extinction .
Should this be allowed to continue ?
Cattle is raised commercially .
These people jump into their high - tech speedboats and herd the whales to share and slaughter them .
Why do n't they go out whale hunting in the traditional sea-vessels that their ancestors have always used ?
Talk about getting something for nothing .

Although I am against all commercial whale hunting seeing the hunt on the Faroe Islands did not disturb me .
For one thing I eat meat , and somebody had the bloody job of killing the cattle .
In this land people have survived by eating whales for a thousand years .
I do n't feel the small impact of these native people eating whales is of any significance to that particular whale population .
However I am sorry for them because we , in the " advanced world " have poisoned their food source not only in the oceans but in streams and lakes across America and the world .
Mercury in fresh top predator fish is now a local concern in many places in America .
This is the real tragedy , not the killing of several hundreds of whales by a small indigenouspopulation .

The Story of Stuff Project is behind the original animated video “ Story of Stuff ” , which has earned more than 10 million views since it ’s release in December 2007 .
“ Story of Bottled Water ” is a short , simple , informative and at the same time entertaining animated short that exposes the hidden dangers and irrationalities of drinking bottled water most of us do n’t think about when we spend $ 1 or more at the store .
Watch it and pass it on !
Hosted by Annie Leonard , the creator of the internet hit The Story of Stuff , the film was co-produced with five leading sustainability advocacy organizations : Corporate Accountability International , Environmental Working Group , Food & Water Watch , Polaris Institute and Pacific Institute .
The Story of Bottled Water employs the Story of Stuff style to tell the story of manufactured demand , specifically how
you get Americans to buy more than half a billion bottles of water every week when they can get it almost free from a tap .
Over seven minutes , the film explores the bottled water industry ’s attacks on tap water safety and its use of seductive , environmental - themed marketing to cover up the mountains of plastic waste it produces .
The film concludes with a call for viewers to make a personal commitment to avoid bottled water and support public investment in clean , available tap water for all .
The Story of Bottled Water is being released on World Water Day , an annual UN - sponsored day of action to support access to clean , safe water for the world ’s people .
Globally , more than 1 billion have little choice but to use potentially harmful sources of water , leading to what the World Health Organization calls “ a silent humanitarian crisis . ”
Meanwhile , many Americans , who generally have access to safe and abundant water from the kitchen tap , drink bottled water despite the enormous waste of money , energy and resources it represents .
The film ’s release comes as the practice of bottling water is coming under increasing fire , with major companies like Google and cities from coast to coast starting to ‘ think outside the bottle . ’
A Harris Poll on environmental behavior conducted this past fall found 29 % of those surveyed reported switching from bottled water to tap in the past year .
“ Cities and states are spending hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on bottled water , and that ’s not to mention what ’s spent to deal with all the plastic bottles that are thrown out , ” said Leslie Samuelrich of Corporate Accountability International .
“ It sends the wrong message about the quality of the tap .
What if we instead spent that money supporting public water systems or preventing water pollution in the first place ? ”
The organization is releasing its second
report on state spending on bottled water on March 23 , calling on public officials to buck the bottle as was done last May in New York at their urging .
( www.StopCorporateAbuse.org)
The Story of Bottled Water companion website ( www.storyofstuff.org/bottledwater) will serve as an interactive launch pad for information and activism .
The site offers viewers a series of ways to get involved , including links to the partners ’ campaigns , as well as downloadable resources and information , including an annotated script .
“ Bottled water usage is in decline in the United States for the first time in three decades , thanks in part to the hard work of our partners on this film .
We hope this film helps to drive the final nail in this huge rip off , ” said Annie Leonard , Director of the Story of Stuff Project .
The Story of Bottled Water is the second in a series of five new short films that The Story of Stuff Project is releasing this year with Free Range Studios ( www.freerangestudios.com) and more than a dozen of the world ’s leading environmental organizations .
The first film in the series , The Story of Cap & Trade , was released on - line in December 2009 and has garnered over 600,000 views .
The original Story of Stuff has been viewed over 10 million times since its release in December 2007 .
( CNN ) --
The Oklahoma Senate voted Tuesday to override the governor 's vetoes and pass two strong anti-abortion measures .
One law requires women to undergo an ultrasound examination and listen to a description of what it shows before getting an abortion .
Senate President Pro Tempore Glenn Coffee , a Republican , said Tuesday 's vote shows lawmakers listened to Oklahoma 's residents and " made a bold statement in support of the sanctity of life . "
But Democratic Gov. Brad Henry has called the legislation " an unconstitutional attempt by the Oklahoma legislature to insert government into the private lives and decisions of its citizens . "
Henry vetoed the bill and another abortion - related measure Friday , but the state House on Monday overwhelmingly voted to override both vetoes , with House Speaker Chris Benge , a Republican , lauding his colleagues for moving quickly .
The Senate 's 36 - 12 vote Tuesday was the final step required to make the bills laws
" Those who rallied behind this cause reflected the core values of Oklahoma citizens , and I applaud my colleagues in providing more safeguards for the life of the unborn , " Coffee said .
Henry said he was disappointed by Tuesday 's vote .
" It signals the beginning of another costly and possibly futile legal battle for the state of Oklahoma .
Both laws will be challenged and , in all likelihood , overturned by the courts as unconstitutional , " he said .
" I fear this entire exercise will ultimately be a waste of taxpayers ' time and money . "
In a statement issued after his vetoes Friday , Henry sharply criticized the laws .
" State policymakers should never mandate that a citizen be forced to undergo any medical procedure against his or her will , especially when such a procedure could cause physical or mental trauma , " Henry said .
" To do so amounts to an unconstitutional invasion of privacy . "
Henry said one of the flaws of the ultrasound bill was that it lacked an exemption for rape and incest victims .
Henry vetoed similar legislation in 2008 .
His veto was overridden .
The State Supreme Court struck down the legislation because it contained multiple subjects , a violation of the state Constitution requiring measures to deal with a single subject , Bennett said .
The Center for Reproductive Rights said it had filed a lawsuit challenging the new law after Tuesday 's Senate vote .
" Oklahoma has now passed the most burdensome ultrasound law in the country , " Nancy Northup , the organization 's president , told CNN .
" Until Oklahoma stops harassing women who are seeking abortions , we will continue to sue the state on these unconstitutional restrictions . "
Coffee said challenging the new laws in court would go against what Oklahoma residents want .
" The voice of the people has spoken twice now this session in the Senate and twice in the House , and I sincerely hope those who would reverse the people 's voice would think twice before acting , " he said .
The other measure approved by legislators Tuesday prohibits pregnant women and their families from seeking legal damages if physicians " knowingly and negligently " withhold key information or provide inaccurate information about their pregnancies .
Henry , in opposing the bill , said it would be " unconscionable to grant a physician legal protection to mislead or misinform a pregnant woman in an effort to impose his or her personal beliefs on his patient . "
Such an issue would be particularly relevant to fetuses with disabilities .
" By prohibiting recovery of damages in wrongful birth and life malpractice actions , the legislation would allow unscrupulous , reckless or negligent physicians to knowingly withhold information or negligently provide inaccurate information to pregnant women without facing the potential of legal consequences , " the governor said .
The House voted to override the veto of the ultrasound bill by an 81 to 14 vote , well above the three - fourths majority required .
State Rep. Lisa Billy , a Republican , said the bill " does nothing more than give women as much information as possible before they make the life - altering decision to have an abortion . "
" I do n't want a single woman to go through the lifelong torture of having an abortion without having all the relevant information , " Billy said .
The House voted 84 to 12 to override the veto over the legal damages prohibition .
State Rep. Dan Sullivan , a Republican , said the bill " simply states that a doctor cannot be sued based on the opinion after birth that a child would have been better off if he or she had been aborted . "
" A bipartisan coalition of members supported this bill the first time , and I am pleased they did again today , " Sullivan said .
Benge , the House speaker , said , " We must move to stop the degradation of human life seen in recent years and stand up for those who cannot defend themselves . "
CNN's Joe Sterling and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) , the publicly - funded private company that wields heavy influence over policing policy , will be included in the Freedom of Information Act from October next year .
The Ministry of Justice 's announcement today follows criticism of ACPO 's lack of accountability despite its powerful role .
The firm sets national policy and practice , acts as a lobbying organisation for senior officers , and coordinates cross - force investigations and intelligence operations .
Justice minister Michael Wills said : " ACPO 's functions are concerned with providing leadership for the police force , improving policing , acting as a voice for the force , encouraging high standards of performance and development , providing the strategic police response in times of national need and other ancillary and related functions .
" Policing is clearly recognised as a function of a public nature .
For these reasons it is appropriate to include ACPO ... for all of their functions . "
Sir Hugh Orde , the former chief constable of Northern Ireland who took over as ACPO president last year , has backed the change .
Wills also said the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service and the Financial Ombudsman Service will be added to the Freedom of Information Act next year . ®
I say it ’s both a prequel and a remake because it is .
The film , Caesar , is actually a remake of the original Conquest of the Planet of the Apes , which in turn is a prequel to the first Planet of the Apes movie ( but was fourth in the series ) .
Confused yet ?
The story follows the life of the a young chimp who has been tested on for genetic research .
As he grows , however he develops higher thinking powers , and eventually leads an army of apes in a revolt against mankind .
The end result leads to what we see in Planet of the Apes .
This does differs slightly from the original Conquest of the Planet of the Apes , in which Caesar is a slave along with his fellow apes ( who are all highly evolved ) , who is chosen to be the main human ’s personal slave .
Being in a position of power , Caesar takes control and leads the apes into revolt .
The whole of the original is a parable for discrimination and the segregation that plagued the US at the time of the film ’s release .
Whether or not those same themes will be present in the new film are yet to be seen .
( That is one pissed off monkey )
My excitement comes more from the fact that I am a huge fan of the original series , and Conquest of the Planet of the Apes was my favorite out of all of them .
The problem has been a severe lack of info and progress on this film .
The greenlight for this film actually happened soon after the Planet of the Apes remake back in 2001 ( the shameful attempt by Tim Burton ) , but for some reason kept getting pushed back .
Then a few years ago production seemed to start ramping up again but …
WAM !
The Writers Guild strike .
With all these problems I had given up on ever seeing the project come to life , but news has come out today that production offices at Mammoth Studios have opened the doors , and filming is set begin as soon as mid-July !
Rupert Wyatt is directing this new adaptation , but no firm release date has been set .
At least something is happening on the project now .

The old approach to finding alien life , looking for radio signals , may be played out .
New approaches are getting a lot more public attention , judging from a new Economist article and Paul Davies ' new book , The Eerie Silence .
Advertisement
Sub - titled ‘ Renewing Our Search for Alien Intelligence , ' Davies ' book is making accessible to the general public the kind of discussion experts about the Search For Extra - Terrestrial Intelligence have been having lately .
He looks at the question of whether our SETI strategies of searching radio and optical wavelengths are n't too limited for any chance of success .
Advertisement
After all , technologies like spread spectrum encoding are already masking straightforward radio communications , while conventional broadcasting is giving way to such heavy use of fiber - optics that a planet like ours may go dark at radio wavelengths within a relatively short time as civilizations go , and no more than an infinitesimal flicker in cosmological terms .
Thus the interest in alternatives like hunting up Dyson spheres , the search for which Dick Carrigan has so actively championed .
The few searches for such spheres have been unsuccessful , but we 've only begun to look for signs of the technologies of vastly more powerful cultures .
Dyson Spheres and Their Signature
In any case , Dyson spheres would be tough to locate , although it 's interesting to note that the Allen Telescope Array will investigate thirteen of what Carrigan calls the " least implausible Dyson sphere candidates , " once it becomes fully operational .
Carrigan built up a list of such candidates by going through data from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite ( IRAS ) , which spotted hundreds of thousands of infrared sources .
A Dyson sphere should radiate in the infrared , but would have to be distinguished from natural sources like stars with thick dust shells , whose own infrared signal might closely mimic that of an artificial construct .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Carrigan goes into all this on his Web site , where he notes that the Calgary Group has classified all the available low - resolution spectra from IRAS into categories including some that would help identify a Dyson sphere candidate .
Thus U stands for a type of object with an ‘ unusual spectrum showing a flat continuum , ' while F stands for ‘ featureless ' objects that may correspond to O or C stars with small amounts of dust .
The C category flags possible late - type cool giant stars with circumstellar shells of carbon dust and emission in the infrared , while H is for HII regions , encompassing various kinds of nebulae .
All these could be considered Dyson sphere look - alikes , and Carrigan notes that more data are becoming available through the Spitzer Space Telescope and surveys like 2MASS .
The key is to pick out an actual Dyson sphere signature from all the noise , one Carrigan describes this way :
… an advanced civilization inhabiting a solar system might break up the planets into very small planetoids or pebbles to form a loose shell that would collect all the light coming from the star .
The shell of planetoids would vastly increase the available " habitable " area and absorb all of the visible light .
The stellar energy would be reradiated at a much lower temperature .
If the visible light was totally absorbed by the planetoids a pure Dyson Sphere signature would be an infrared object with luminosity equivalent to the hidden star and a blackbody distribution with a temperature corresponding to the radius of the planetoid swarm .
For the case of the Sun with the planetoids at the radius of the Earth the temperature would be approximately 300 ºK .

Signs of a Kardashev Type II Culture
But back to The Economist 's article , which notes that Dyson spheres are but one thing an advanced civilization might spend its time creating .
A Kardashev Type II civilization is one capable of exploiting all the energy output of its star , leading to the possibility of interesting forms of stellar engineering .
From the article :
Any civilisation that has built a Dyson sphere will have to have been around for a long time , of course - and in the very long run its star will start to change in unpleasant ways , ballooning to form a red giant .
Another signature of advanced technology would be an attempt to slow this process down .
Red giants are created when a star exhausts its supply of hydrogen at its core , with the result that the inner layer contracts and the outer layers expand , forming a redder and much larger star .
If the star 's outer layers could be mixed into the core , that would slow the process of inflation down .
And , presumably , a sufficiently advanced civilisation would try to do that if it could .
Advertisement
Let 's assume so , and fortunately for distant observers , such an engineering feat would show a particular signature , even if one that , like Dyson spheres , can be confused with natural phenomena :
Such a star would look odd , though .
It would be bluer than it should be and would be of a type known to astronomers as a " blue straggler " .
Although , again , there are perfectly natural reasons these might form .
The universe , though , is an ancient place , so many civilisations could be very old indeed .
Perhaps , then , it will be a sign like this - of a technological civilisation millions of years old - that is seen , rather than some upstart that has not even got its radio waves under control .

Leaving Assumptions Behind
New technologies will help us pursue other observational lines of research .
Using space - based telescopes and , recently , instruments on the ground , we 're learning how to characterize the atmospheres of extrasolar planets .
It 's a process that 's sure to pick up as we refine our techniques , but in the not so distant future we may be able to spot telltale signs of industrial activity on a distant world as well as probing its atmosphere for the chemical signs of life .
Carrigan suggests chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) as one possibility , a type of molecule that would have to correspond to a technology because no natural process produces it .
Advertisement
All of these approaches take us in a new direction , one that , as Dick Carrigan notes , makes no assumptions about the motivation of the originating civilization .
Indeed , he likens the hunt to a form of archaeology , one closer to the search for exoplanets than the attempt to snag a radio signal .
For more , see Carrigan , " Starry Messages : Searching for Signatures of Interstellar Archaeology , " FERMILAB - PUB-09-607 - AD ( abstract ) , which I 'll be discussing in more detail soon , along with cross-references to Davies ' The Eerie Silence .
For as Davies shows , there are many more ways to conceive how the activities of an extraterrestrial civilization could modify the heavens .

BERLIN : Trust in the Catholic Church in Germany has plummeted since the child sexual abuse scandal .
Barely one in six Germans now say they have confidence in the church .
This is accompanied by government statistics showing that people in dioceses affected by paedophile priests are leaving in record numbers .
There is also anger directed at the German - born Pope Benedict .
Fewer than one in four say they trust him , according to a poll carried out by Stern magazine published yesterday .
Only 17 per cent of respondents said they trusted the church and 24 per cent the Pope .
Regensburg , where the Pope 's brother , Bishop Georg Ratzinger , was once in charge of the Domspatzen - '' cathedral sparrows ' ' - and is now at the centre of abuse allegations , is seeing a wave of disillusioned worshippers leaving .
The quirks of a food blogger are many and oft ’ times quite charming , particularly the obsessive photo - taking one .
I have yet to meet a food blogger who does n’t always have a camera ready whenever they ’re in the vicinity of any type of food , from gourmet cuisine to the ever - so - frightening Twinkie .
Depending on the focus of one ’s blog , this photo - taking quirk can either remain strictly in control , only manifesting itself at potlucks or larger functions to get the general “ feel ” of the food vibe ; or it can turn a girl into a stark raving mess who refuses to even post a recipe if the picture is n’t * assume Zoolander accent here * really , really , ridiculously good looking .
As you might have guessed , I fall under the 2nd category .
Granted , part of the problem I had over the weekend ( and the reason why I did n’t end up posting that one promised egg recipe I had in mind ) was that I had forgotten my camera ’s battery charger at work .
Not being able to access all of the photos on my memory card or take anything new certainly put a damper on my weekend of what ought to have been blogging bliss .
I suppose I could have posted the other recipe , as it ’s a good one and the picture is n’t all that bad .
But because I ’ve turned into THAT blogger and I ended up making an even better egg dish over the weekend , I figured I ’d wait and make everyone happy with a new recipe and a nicer photo .
On this weekend ’s jaunt to Safeway for kitty food & other feline provisions , I managed to have enough change left over for some baby portabella mushrooms and a lovely head of butter lettuce ( both on sale ! ) ; and because produce in Poor Girl ’s kitchen has been slowly dwindling , I figured I was worth these splurges .
I had every intention of enjoying both together in a nice giant salad , but as I was slicing the baby Bellas into these thick , meaty - looking slices , I began to imagine them in a steaming hot platter of fajitas .
When the reality of not having tortillas for this endeavor broke through my fajita daydream , I switched gears and began to imagine the mushrooms in a nice cheesy omelette .
That was n’t going to work so well either considering the lack of cheese in my house , so I finally put both dreams together and decided to make a mushroom fajita omelette .
It ’s an unorthodox food pairing but I must say I was quite pleased with the results !
The flavors & textures played off each other nicely , and I did n’t even miss my warm flour tortillas ( that much ) .
This dish is hearty and tasty , and absolutely perfect for a breakfast for dinner night .
And if you ’re not an egg fan , the mushroom fajita filling is excellent on its own so definitely feel free to use it in the traditional fajita manner .
Not much else to note on this one , so let ’s check out the recipe !
This is a major development that both makes financial reform more likely and whatever passes likely to be stronger :
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell ( Ky. ) does not have enough solid commitments from GOP lawmakers to block consideration of a Democratic Wall Street reform bill .
McConnell has circulated a letter within the GOP conference that would have Republicans pledge to block a motion to proceed to a financial regulatory reform bill unless Democrats agree to reopen it for bipartisan negotiations .
But McConnell has fallen short of the 41 signatures he needs to send Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) a clear signal .
On health care , McConnell got his entire caucus to sign a letter like this .
The result was that Democrats simply went around the Republicans .
At least one Republican -- The Hill identified Susan Collins but was was unable to ascertain if there were others -- declined to endorse this strategy this time .
Republicans framed the letter as the only way to force the Democrats to negotiate .
( “ The only way we can get in the room is to show Democrats that they ca n’t ram a bill through the Senate , ” one Senator tells the Hill . )
But that is n't quite correct .
Democrats still need at least one Republican Senator to break a filibuster .
The Republicans will now simply be negotiating from a weaker position .
It 's somewhat akin to collective bargaining versus individual bargaining .
Mitch McConnell is trying to convince Republicans to form a union , so they can demand a higher price from the Democrats by forcing them to make an offer that all , or at least most , Republicans will accept .
To do so , they all need to signal their willingness to stop any bill from passing ( i.e. , strike . )
McConnell 's effort has failed , because the most conciliatory Republicans are no longer willing to bind their position to arch - conservatives like McConnell .
Now Democrats will just go shopping for the Republican offering the lowest price , in terms of weakening the legislation , to support the bill .
Keep this in mind the next time Republicans insist that collective bargaining does n't help workers .
The Elam family wishes to thank the fans of our son / brother / father uncle / nephew / cousin Keith aka GURU for the outpouring of love , concern and support .
Our hearts are broken by the loss of someone we loved so much .
GURU was devoted to his young son , who will most keenly feel his absence .
GURU suffered from multiple myeloma for over a year .
Accrued complications from this illness led to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest .
As a result , GURU was in a coma from mid February until his death and never regained consciousness .
Early on the morning of April 19th , he became hypertensive due to low blood pressure .
He again went into cardiac arrest and slipped away from us .
GURU died far too young but he was , and we are , proud of all his many legendary musical contributions .
The family is not aware of any foundations established by GURU .
We know and understand that countless fans want to express their condolences and love and , to that end , we are planning a memorial event in the near future that will be all - inclusive .
Please look for further details from the family as they become available .

Last month the claim that Band Aid famine relief money had been used to arm rebels elicited a fierce response from Bob Geldof .
He accused the BBC , which aired the allegation , of " disingenuous posturing " , distortion and a failure to provide credible evidence .
He also said that it would be a " tragedy " if people stopped giving to charity and requested that journalists " stop venturing palpably untrue statements dressed up as fact " .
It was a characteristically heartfelt response , filled with anger and indignation .
No wonder he was annoyed .
In effect , the BBC report had said that his vision of humanitarian intervention , which had galvanised a generation , was , at least partially , a sham .
Exactly what took place in Ethiopia 25 years ago will probably never be established beyond doubt .
After all , it was a war zone mired in chaos , desperation and human misery .
It may be , as Geldof insists , that the vast majority of aid his charity raised reached its intended recipients and that none was used , contrary to the BBC report , to buy military hardware .
But according to a new book by the Dutch writer Linda Polman , such positive outcomes are the exception in the field of humanitarian aid .
In War Games : the Story of Aid and War in Modern Times , Polman argues that humanitarianism has become a massive industry that , along with the global media , forms an unholy alliance with warmongers .
Since the end of the cold war , the business of humanitarian aid has flourished .
During the proxy wars fought by African and Asian states backed by the Soviet Union , China and the USA , aid agencies found it very difficult to gain access to war zones .
But with the end of the Soviet Union , suggests Polman , regions afflicted by war became something like charity enterprise zones , creating a massive expansion in the aid industry .
Back in 1980 there were about 40 INGOs ( international non-government organisations ) dealing with Cambodian refugees on the Thai border .
A decade later , there were 250 operating during the Yugoslavian war .
By 2004 , there were 2,500 involved in Afghanistan .
All too frequently , according to Polman , the result is not what it says in the charity brochures .
She cites a damning catalogue of examples from Biafra to Darfur , and including the Ethiopian famine , in which humanitarian aid has helped prolong wars , or rewarded the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing and genocide rather than the victims .
Perhaps the most striking case in the book deals with the aftermath of the genocide in Rwanda in which the Hutu killers fled en masse across the border to what was then Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of Congo ) .
There , in Goma , huge refugee camps were assembled and served by an enormous array of international agencies , while back in Rwanda , where Tutsi corpses filled rivers and lakes , aid was not so focused .
The world was looking for refugees , the symbol of human catastrophe , and the refugees were Hutus .
This meant the militias that had committed the atrocities received food , shelter and support , courtesy of international appeals , while their surviving victims were left destitute .
Worse still , Polman believes the aid enabled the Hutu extremists to continue their attempt to exterminate the Tutsis from the security of the UNHCR camps in Goma .
" Without humanitarian aid , " she writes , " the Hutus ' war would almost certainly have ground to a halt fairly quickly . "
Such perverse situations , according to Polman , stem from the issue of neutrality .
Ever since Henri Dunant set up the Red Cross back in the late 19th century , the role of the humanitarian has been to avoid taking sides in war .
Dunant 's concern was not the rights or wrongs of any particular conflict .
Instead he simply wished to ease the suffering of , and improve the care offered to , all victims of war , which at that time were mostly soldiers .
In this endeavour he was opposed by Florence Nightingale who argued that Dunant 's compassionate vision was a charter for prolonging war .
In her book , Polman maintains that when aid organisations do n't actively discriminate , the most likely beneficiaries of war zone operations are the powerful , rather than the most needy .
Not only is it the soldiers and militias who are able to levy taxes on aid , cargos and the movement of charity personnel , and to steal or divert funds , it is also these groups and the elites that have best learned the images and triggers that attract aid .
War Games is a chastening polemic which does n't exactly leave you rushing to renew your charity direct debits .
Was this Polman 's intention , to discourage humanitarian donations ?
" No , no , no , " she says , when we meet at her hotel in London .
" The best thing that can happen is that people realise that aid as it is given can be improved .
Read the reports by the agencies themselves .
They know what 's going wrong . "
The problems , she says , is that while aid agencies may recognise their failings they are unwilling to address them because of the pressures of competition .
Humanitarianism is a multi-billion - dollar business and if one charity pulls out of an operation , be it from moral or strategic concerns , there are plenty of others who will fill their place and solicit their funding .
Recent years have also seen a large growth in smaller organisations , set up to negate the bureaucratic practices of the larger aid agencies .
They can be run by just a handful of people – hence they 've been named MONGOs ( my own non-governmental organisations ) – but Polman believes that while they may cut through red tape , they only add to the sense of chaos and competition in the field .
There are few words of comfort , much less praise , to be found in the book .
If Polman castigates aid organisations for blindly supporting belligerents , she is also critical when they abandon their neutrality .
She admonishes agencies in Afghanistan , for example , for being too tied to the policy of coalition forces .
As INGOS run projects that " are aimed in part at depriving terrorists of their grass - roots support " she points out that it's no surprise that the Taliban view " aid as an instrument of war " .
Therefore aid agencies have only themselves to blame for elision between humanitarianism and military intervention .
It seems that INGOs are damned if they do , and damned if they do n't .
So what is it to be , are they supposed to be neutral or not ?
" Whether you 're being manipulated by the Sudanese regime or coalition forces in Afghanistan , you are always an instrument of war , " she says .
" The system as it is now , the humanitarian ground rules say that aid agencies are neutral and therefore not responsible for what other people do to their aid .
I think that 's too easy .
They should stop claiming neutrality , stop claiming that they 're above the law . "
She says that if George Bush could be arrested for war crimes , a prospect she would welcome , then " perhaps aid agencies can be held responsible for what they do as well " .
If there is understandable public suspicion of private contractors , like project - management firm Halliburton , who profit from war , she asks , why are private aid organisations treated differently ?
So how would she describe the humanitarian agencies that in her opinion enabled the continuation of the Hutus ' genocidal attack on the Tutsis ?
" Perhaps war criminals , " she muses .
" It 's interesting . "
Interesting , yes , but that 's also an extremely grave charge .
" This is true , " she says with that matter - of - factness for which the Dutch are justly renowned , " because we do n't see it that way .
We see it as aid agencies being placed in circumstances in which they have no choice .
I 'm saying they do have a choice .
They have a choice of not doing it . "
On balance , then , does she believe that the charity effort , including Band Aid , in response to what she maintains was a war - created famine in Ethiopia , made a bad situation worse ?
" Umm , " she pauses .
" It did nothing to stop the bad situation .
It facilitated the regime . "
The irony here is that Band Aid has now been accused of facilitating the rebels .
She says she hopes that either Geldof or those involved at the BBC will sue one or the other so that the truth will come out .
Either way , she is in no doubt that aid helped extend the war that caused the famine in the first place .
Fifty this year , Polman is a veteran of war zones .
On a visit to a friend in Somalia in 1993 she encountered her first UN peacekeeping mission .
She then followed the " blue helmets " to Haiti and Rwanda ( she has also lived and worked in Sierra Leone ) .
She wrote a book about her experience reporting on the peacekeepers entitled We Did Nothing .
As the title suggests , the book was another indictment of a supposed good cause , in this case peacekeeping .
Her greatest fury was reserved for an incident at Kibeho refugee camp in Rwanda when UN peacekeepers stood by while Rwandan Tutsis launched a massacre on Hutus refugees that , elsewhere in War Games , Polman assails the INGOs for supporting .
Like many good journalists ' , her indignation is large enough to contain a variety of contradictions .
She believes that George Bush should answer in court for US actions in Iraq , yet she also wants the US army to go into Darfur .
" Do n't go after the oil , " she says , " go after human - rights violations .
Europeans believe too much in dialogue .
We do not use violence against Burma , for example , but it could help . "
Another area of complexity in which Polman sprays around denunciations like a machine gunner behind enemy lines is what might be called the micro-economy of aid .
She describes in censorious detail the relative luxury in which aid workers often live in the developing world .
But she also condemns the way that aid organisations draw local staff away from vital industries by paying way above the domestic rate .
There are not easy solutions to these problems .
Why should humanitarian workers from the developed world live in greater hardship than their compatriots , and what would be said of a charity that paid its local workers , who take the greatest risks , a pittance ?
" Aid workers should respect the fact that local people live in poverty , " she says .
" It is perverse , for example in Haiti , that there are people sleeping outside in the streets and aid workers step over them to enter the clubs . "
I point out that most aid workers probably would n't be quite so insensitive , and that it 's neither shocking nor sinister that humanitarians are also human : they also need to relax after work sometimes in a bar .
" I think it 's shocking and sinister , " she retorts , " if aid workers engage in child prostitution or that aid workers visit brothels . "
Quite , but are there any aid organisations that encourage such practices ?
" I hope not , " says Polman , " but I do know of cases where aid organisations knew that employees were engaged in this and they decided to smother the case .
They did not follow up or remove the person . "
Are you talking about the Catholic church ?
" It sounds like that , does n't it , " she smiles , before naming the place and organisation , and informing me that the individual remains in his position .
Surely , though , a single case , no matter how disturbing , can't be made to represent the norm .
" It 's there , always , " she says .
" It can be seen .
And I know it adds to the impression people have of aid organisations and makes them cynical . "
Nor does Polman spare her own profession , especially in the shape of the broadcast media .
It 's the visual image that sets the news agenda , and the more shocking the image , the more attention it gains , and the more attention it gains , the more aid it 's likely to attract .
Polman focuses on an account given to the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission which documents a secret meeting between rebels and government troops in which they both noted they only received coverage from BBC World when amputees emerged from the jungle .
Whether or not this is an accurate account , it 's clear that there are few images that prick the conscience , and thus open the wallet , more rapidly than that of a child amputee .
Does that mean that amputees should not be filmed ?
" Well , " she says , " first of all journalism will have to acknowledge that the problem is there .
I do believe that the receivers of our aid are learning entities , they are learning organisations , groups and governments .
Which is only logical .
They have seen the mechanisms of the aid agencies at work for many decades and so it 's only natural that they become better and better at understanding what the rules of the aid industry are . "
By the end our conversation , I feel even less confident about the direct debits than I did having read the book .
What , I ask , would she do if she could institute one change in the aid business ?
" I would force aid agencies to combine in the interests of the people they claim to be helping .
That means you go to an area and assess what is best for the people , not what is best for the organisation or the system of aid .
In Darfur , the aid agencies say , ' If only we could work together , we could make a fist against the Sudanese government that is now manipulating us . '
You 're in the business of saving lives .
Do it in a way that you can save the most lives or for the cheapest price .
That can mean sometimes , you do n't go to an area and you choose other victims in areas that we do n't see on TV .
Go to where you can save the most people for the same money .
Stop the system of rewarding bad behaviour .
If your aid is being manipulated , do n't give aid to those doing the manipulation . "
At heart , she says , she 's an old hippie who believes there 's a better way .
But in reality humanitarian aid necessarily takes place in imperfect conditions .
It 's always going to be subject to compromise and error .
Public scrutiny can help , but how far are people prepared to go in assessing available information ?
It seems that there 's no shortage of donors who are ready to run marathons to raise funds , but , as things stand , far less who are willing to wade through the documentation , if it even exists .
There 's an argument , most recently made by the Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo , that says aid is the cause of rather than the solution to developing - world problems .
But when the next appeal comes bearing images of starving children , most of us who care will neither look away nor dig a little deeper into the political background .
Instead we will get out the cheque book .
Because while charity does n't always benefit the intended recipient , it usually manages to make the donor feel better .

CASE HISTORY 1
ETHIOPIA , 1984 - 85
Mother and children in a camp during the famine in Ethiopia , 1985 .
Photograph : Herbie Knott / Rex Features
In 1984 prolonged drought coincided with civil war between the communist junta that governed Ethiopia and rebels in the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigray .
In an effort to win the battle , the government soldiers , writes Polman , " sealed off the northern region and went to work .
They shot men and boys dead .
They raped and mutilated women and girls .
They flung infants on to fires alive .
They set schools and clinics ablaze , slaughtered livestock , burned grain stores and poisoned water sources with human corpses and dead animals . "
And then they invited in the international media to witness the flood of famine refugees .
Journalists like Michael Buerk decided that the war was a side - story to the main issue that demanded attention : the unfolding humanitarian crisis of mass starvation .
Following Buerk 's famous BBC report , an enormous fundraising campaign took place , including Band Aid , and thousands of aid workers and journalists flew in .
" They were forced to change their dollars for local currency at rates favourable to the regime , " Polman states , " and this alone helped to keep the Ethiopian war machine running .
Food aid was used as bait to lure starving villagers into camps .
They were held there awaiting deportation to the state farms in the south .
A life of forced labour lay ahead . "
It 's not known how many Ethiopians died during the operation , but estimates vary between 300,000 and one million .
CASE HISTORY 2

In July 1994 the Rwandan Patriotic Front , formed from Tutsi refugees based in Uganda , invaded Rwanda to put a stop to the genocide committed by Hutus on Tutsis .
The Hutu militias , and many of the Hutu population , fled across the border to Goma in Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of Congo ) .
Shocked by the news of the genocide , in which up to one million Rwandans ( overwhelmingly Tutsis ) were slaughtered , the global community raised $ 1.5 bn ( £ 976 m ) in relief aid .
The first and most conspicuous beneficiaries of this effort were the Hutu refugees , including among them many of those responsible for ordering and carrying out the genocide .
" The rescue operation mounted for the Hutus , " writes Polman , " became the best - funded humanitarian operation in the world . "
Twenty - five refugee camps were built around Goma , supported by 250 different aid organisations , each with their own flags and logos .
The Hutus brought with them everything they 'd looted from their victims , leaving an impoverished country in which , according to Polman , " hardly any aid organisations , let alone investors , had shown their faces " .
Meanwhile the Hutu architects of the genocide reasserted their leadership in the camps .
" On all the food rations distributed by aid organisations , " Polman asserts , " the Hutu government , from its tourist hotels , levied a ' war tax ' to pay its army , which enabled it to continue its campaign of extermination against the Tutsi enemy back in Rwanda . "
Eventually , after repeated warnings , in November 1996 , the Rwandan Tutsi army invaded Goma and closed the camps , killing several thousand Hutus in the process .
Fiona Terry , project leader of the French Médecins sans Frontières , described Goma as a " total ethical disaster . "
CASE HISTORY 3
AFGHANISTAN , 2001 - PRESENT

Polman depicts Kabul as a city divided between the poverty suffered by its inhabitants and the luxury enjoyed by foreign aid workers who " can be found [ at a nightclub called L'Atmosphere ] with cocktails and glasses of wine , or relaxing in the swimming pool near the bar " .
Beyond Kabul , aid money behaves like Zeno 's arrow , never quite reaching its target , as each of a succession of subcontractors takes a cut and passes what 's left on to the next .
This process , she says , is largely unsupervised because aid workers have become Taliban targets and are too worried to venture out into dangerous provinces .
" Unsupervised aid invites theft and corruption , " she writes , " which strengthens and multiplies Taliban support , leading to greater insecurity , which brings more security companies , prompting even more hostility towards foreigners , with greater insecurity , because [ there are ] more Taliban , as a result .
So even more aid remains unsupervised . "
One house - building project in Bamiyan Province began with $ 150 m ( £ 97 m ) in funding .
Once various aid agencies had taken a cut for their own organisations , a subcontractor bought wooden beams from Iran , which were delivered by a company owned by the governor of the province at five times the standard freight fee .
The beams , it turned out , were too heavy for the houses , so the villagers chopped up the timber to use for cooking fuel .
When it comes to being a scientist , Adam is quite the standout .
No , he is not a Nobel Prize Laureate or even a prodigy .
He ’s more like a prototype – the first robot to design , perform , and interpret a series of scientific experiments leading to a new discovery .
As anyone who has taken a high school science class can confirm , taking detailed notes is an integral part of doing science .
Unfortunately , this is one area where even the most dedicated scientists can fall short .
Unless of course that scientist is a robot that can record the experiments as they are being performed .
As if the development of an autonomous robot with a knack for science was n’t impressive enough , Adam quickly wowed his creators by solving a yeast genetics puzzle that had baffled researchers for decades !
And it ’s not difficult to imagine the advantages of a robot scientist in the laboratory .
Adam and his counterparts will significantly increase the rates at which important advancements are made , inching us closer to the time when robots are more our colleagues than our tools .
Check out the video below to see Adam carrying out a typical experiment .
Automation of human tasks is a natural goal of robotics development .
We have already seen many areas where automation has become the standard .
And even science has seen the advent of nearly autonomous software programs that can deduce principles of physics .
As artificial intelligence continues to evolve however , we are beginning to see the introduction of robotics in many “ high - skill ” fields such as research and medicine .
In their report in the journal Science , Professor Ross King and his group at Aberystwyth University describe Adam as the ultimate laboratory companion .
Unlike mere humans , Adam does n’t tire or lose focus while performing repetitive tasks .
But do n’t mistake Adam as just a high - tech minion .
His developers introduced him to a yeast genetics mystery that had eluded discovery for quite some time .
As with all living organisms , yeast have proteins called enzymes that catalyze many of the chemical reactions necessary for life to occur .
Each of these enzymes is encoded in the yeast ’s genome , but a few of these enzymes were difficult to link to particular genes .
For decades , geneticists had toiled to figure out which genes encode a few of these “ orphan ” enzymes .
Dr. King and colleagues gave Adam a database containing information on the enzymes , the chemicals and reagents to do the experiments , and access to the yeast cultures .
After that , a human technician only came around to refill the necessary reagents and remove the waste products generated from the experiments ( evidently , Adam is unable to perform those lowly tasks ! ) .
So what did Adam find ?
After multiple rounds of experimentation and analysis , Adam found exactly which yeast genes encode which “ orphan ” enzymes !
The human scientists then went to work to verify his findings by doing the experiments manually .
Eureka !
Adam had indeed solved the problem !
While scientists may be breaking out in a sweat at the thought of a robot taking over their job , the importance of automation in science ca n’t be overstated .
Despite the vast amounts of money spent on scientific research today , it can still take years , if not decades , before a discovery makes its way to the general public , whether it ’s a new technology or a new treatment for a disease .
Part of this delay comes from the limitations in human workers , i.e. fatigue , errors , etc .
With robot scientists working around the clock and contributing to scientific knowledge , we can significantly speed up the rate at which important and potentially life - saving discoveries are made .
And though some may be hesitant to accept the ever - increasing roles of robots in our world , I , for one , think it will only serve to enhance our lives !

The group formerly known as Exit Through the Gift Shop receives an unexpected reward for acceding to graffiti artist 's request
The painting arrived outside Simon Duncan 's west London home inside a battered old van .
Overnight it has put him at the heart of street culture and made him £ 200,000 wealthier .
The new work by Banksy was sent unexpectedly last week to Duncan , a 41 - year - old web developer , as compensation for the world - renowned graffiti artist having coincidentally chosen the name of Duncan 's band as the title for his film , Exit Through the Gift Shop .
" I am a drummer in a band that was called Exit Through the Gift Shop that I started with friends 18 months before I turned 40 .
It was a kind of midlife crisis , but we are still going , with a different line - up , and it has become a bit more serious , " said Duncan , who agreed to change his band 's name to Brace Yourself in an arrangement with Banksy .
" We had these hilarious emails from someone saying he was Banksy , but we did n't know if they were genuine , " said Duncan .
" Then a scruffy white van arrived .
The driver had no idea what he was carrying . "
The band plan to unveil their new name and backdrop , which shows the grim reaper riding a dodgem car , at a London gig this week .
" When we saw the painting we could not believe it , " said Duncan .
" It is the size of a double bed , for a start .
We had to insure it , so a man from Sotheby 's came over to see it in my loft .
He said to me , ' This is surreal .
I have just been valuing an 18th - century portrait in a stately home , but it is not as valuable as this . ' "
The band have put the painting in storage at Sotheby 's and will perform in front of a full - size copy .
Cameron Douglas , the 31 - year - old son of the actor Michael Douglas , was sentenced to five years in prison on drug- related charges in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Tuesday .
In January , Mr. Douglas , a D.J. and an aspiring actor , pleaded guilty to charges that he distributed large quantities of methamphetamines and cocaine over a three - year period .
He also pleaded guilty to possession of heroin , a charge that was brought while he was on house arrest and awaiting trial .
Judge Richard M. Berman also sentenced Mr. Douglas to five years of supervised release ; the judge said that he was not obligated to follow federal sentencing guidelines , which normally would call for a 10 - year sentence for such charges .
Federal prosecutors did not challenge the sentence .
In court , Mr. Douglas wore a black suit with his hair combed back .
He struck a humble tone in his remarks before the bench .

Gradually we are getting confirmation that Chinese " posturing " about offloading US debt is all too real .
The most recent TIC data confirmed the Treasury 's greatest nightmare : China is now dumping US bonds .
In December China sold $ 34.2 billion of debt ( $ 38.8 billion in Bills sold offset by $ 4.6 billion in Bonds purchased ) , lowering its total holdings $ 755.4 billion , the lowest since February 2009 , and for the first time in many years relinquishing the top US debt holder spot to Japan , which bought $ 11.5 billion ( mostly in Bonds , selling $ 1.4 billion Bills ) bringing its total to $ 768.8 billion .
Also , very oddly , the surge in UK holding continues , providing yet another clue as to the identity if the " direct bidder " - as we first assumed , these are merely UK centers transacting primarily on behalf of China as well as hedge funds , which are accumulating US debt under the radar .
UK holdings increased from $ 230.7 billion to $ 302.5 billion in December : a stunning $ 70 billion increase in a two month span .
Yet , with the identity of the UK - based buyers a secret , it really could be anyone ...
Anyone with very deep pockets .
We will go through the TIC data in much more detail later ; for now here is the official press release .

Nicknamed “ snowpocalypse ” and “ snowmageddon , ” an exceptionally severe winter storm dropped several feet of snow around the Washington , D.C. , area in early February 2010 .
Crashed and abandoned cars littered roads as airlines canceled hundreds of flights .
Even the DC Metro train system stopped functioning in places .
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite captured this true - color image on February 7 , 2010 , showing part of the region affected by heavy snowfall .
Snow blankets the area hundreds of kilometers inland from the Atlantic coastline .
Along the latitude of New York City , however , snow cover thins considerably .
Authorities urged residents to stay indoors , but hundreds of thousands lost electricity .
The Washington Post reported that the snow - induced standstill might last until midweek , especially if a second winter storm arrived as predicted on Tuesday .
As of Monday morning , government offices remained closed , and many streets remained unplowed .

In a move that could bring an end to the $ 40 cup of coffee , Bank of America said on Tuesday that it was doing away with overdraft fees on purchases made with debit cards , a decision that could cost the bank tens of millions a year in revenue and put pressure on other banks to do the same .
Bank officials said that effective this summer , customers who try to make purchases with their debit cards without enough money in their checking accounts will simply be declined .
Debit purchases account for roughly 60 percent of overdrafts at Bank of America , the nation ’s largest issuer of debit cards .
Banks are bracing for a new federal rule that will require them to get permission from account holders before providing overdraft services for debit purchases and A.T.M. withdrawals .
That change was already expected to wipe out billions of dollars in overdraft revenue for the banks .
“ What our customers kept telling me is ‘ just do n’t let me spend money that I do n’t have , ’ ” said Susan Faulkner , the bank ’s deposit and card product executive , who said the overdraft changes were part of a broader push to build trust among its customers .
“ We wanted to help them avoid those unexpected overdraft fees . ”

God may send a man good meate , but the devyll sende an evyll cooke .
edieval cooking was not , as has been so easily assumed , a dubious practice that produced inedible dishes filled with strange spices and dangerous ingredients .
Medieval cooks used many of the same type of foodstuffs that are in use today , in addition to forms of food preparation familiar to any of us .
The dishes and recipes they prepared were neither inedible nor dangerous , but extremely delicious and nourishing products that employed the finest meats , grains , fruits , and vegetables medieval society was capable of developing .
Then as now , mankind knew what tasted good and the sauces , stews , pies , roasts , and soups that satisfied the 14th century family are just as wholesome and enjoyable today .
any of the recipes in this site originate from true medieval & Renaissance sources , are fully documented , and have been adapted for use in the modern kitchen .
Original sources & bibliographies are featured whenever possible ; historical authenticity and research are our main concerns , along with producing viands that are enjoyable & good to eat .

A high - level panel of academic , labor , community and business leaders released a report March 3 saying Toyota ’s decision to close the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. ( NUMMI ) auto plant in Fremont , Calif .
March 31 goes against the firm ’s business interests , and its devastating effects will ripple throughout California .
The commission producing the report , “ Commitment is a Two - Way Street , ” was named by California state Treasurer Bill Lockyer .
Headed by Professor Harley Shaiken of the University of California at Berkeley , it includes elected officials , leaders of the Sierra Club , the Chamber of Commerce , the California Labor Federation and others .
The document skewers Toyota ’s stated reasons for leaving :
• The company says General Motors ’ departure from the 25 - year - old joint venture after its bankruptcy last year undermined NUMMI ’s economic viability .
But , the report said , GM ’s production represented only about 15 percent of the plant ’s output over the last decade .
That could easily be replaced by building more of the Corollas it sells in the U.S. , or bringing in a new model .
• Toyota claims it has excess capacity in North America .
But even if it ran its present plants including NUMMI at full capacity , the panel said , it would still only be able to build about 70 percent of the vehicles it expects to sell in the U.S. next year .
• The company says supply lines to NUMMI are too long .
But over one - third of parts currently come from Japan – closer to California than to Toyota ’s other plants in Indiana and Texas .
With California accounting for nearly one - fifth of U.S. Toyota sales and 5 percent of global sales in 2007 , NUMMI is also in the heart of a major market .
• Toyota claims the 48 - year - old NUMMI plant is too old .
But in fact it is about the same age as other highly productive auto plants , including one in Japan where Toyota makes all Corollas sold there .
Calling NUMMI “ a very competitive auto plant today , ” the report cited “ high productivity , award - winning quality and competitive labor costs . ”
It said NUMMI could become even more productive by introducing hybrids and anchoring “ a new green network ” of advanced manufacturing .
Saying NUMMI ’s “ highly skilled and experienced workforce ” is its most important asset , the panel warned that the workers ’ “ talent , skill and problem - solving ability … cannot be reproduced overnight . ”
The report emphasizes the devastation NUMMI ’s closing would cause to the community .
Besides the 4,700 United Auto Workers members who now work there , over 20,000 work for the plant ’s supply network .
Replacing those jobs would cost an estimated $ 2.3 billion , the panel said , while the state and communities would lose nearly $ 1 billion in revenues in the following decade .
Closing NUMMI would really go against the grain of the company ’s current ad campaign about its principles of respect for people and continuous improvement , panel chair Shaiken told a March 3 press conference .
“ In fact , one could say they might have to consider recalling the ad campaign in the wake of a closure on March 31 . ”
Lockyer called on Toyota to “ step back for a moment ” and realize that continuing to operate the plant would emphasize its “ corporate citizenship in California and in the United States . ”
Lockyer is dispatching a delegation to Japan – one of many to meet with Toyota management in recent months – and is requesting a March 8 meeting with company president Akio Toyota .
Meanwhile , the NUMMI workers ’ union , UAW Local 2244 , and labor and community supporters around the country , are keeping up their campaign for a boycott of Toyota vehicles if the plant closes .
No one talks about Washington 's first ( and much less successful ) crossing of the Delaware .
Although the painting of the 2nd crossing ( by
Leutze )
is more well known , this one better illustrates Washington 's old adage , " Perseverance is key to success . "
Again , so nice to see an artist going after the less cliche parts of American history .

A ‘ maybe one day ’ turns into a chance for Katie
“ I keep thinking , what if I knew about the Duke University clinical study and we had n’t saved Katie ’s cord blood — we would not even have had this chance .
She has a chance , ” Katie ’s mom Amy says .
Her husband Paul chimes in , “ If this helps Katie — it ’s huge . ”
Amy and Paul are talking about their daughter Katie — a sweet , loving , social and affectionate four year old with a hearty laugh , infectious smile and lots of curiosity .
Katie was born with a condition called hypotonia — low muscle tone that affects both her gross and fine motor skills .
As a result , Katie ca n’t walk independently , she never had the coordination to crawl ( although she ’s quite the scooter ! ) and she was not physically able to sit until she was 16 months old — almost a year later than typical child development .
Katie ’s speech is also affected — she is currently saying a few words but working hard with therapists to learn to pronounce different letter sounds .
Rewind a handful of years when Amy and Paul were expecting .
Amy got an email from her cousin .
“ Have you considered banking cord blood ? ” her cousin asked , reminding Amy that their family had a lot of leukemia in it .
“ Maybe one day it will help someone . ”
As it turns out that “ one day ” has materialized .
After learning about a study at Duke University where children with cerebral palsy are being given their own cord blood stem cells to explore if it is improving their condition , Amy got in touch with the study administrator .
Six weeks later she found out that Katie had been accepted into the study .
“ It was one of the best days of my life , ” recalls Amy .
It ’s only been six weeks since the infusion at Duke University , which took place in early January 2010 , and while Amy and Paul were told not to expect to see results for more than half a year , they do n’t know how else to explain Katie ’s progress .
She has begun pointing to pictures in books , stomping her feet and bouncing to music .
She has also initiated walking with her walker — something that only ever happened before with a bribe of M&Ms.
Like Amy and Paul , Katie ’s therapists can’t believe her progress , noting lists of new and improved skills daily and acknowledging that Katie seems more focused .
Amy welcomes their feedback because although she ’s trying to be objective , “ I worry that I ’m making things up because I ’m so hopeful . ”
In fact , Amy admits , “ I have to pinch myself sometimes and say , is this really happening ? ”
As testimony to the improvements Katie is experiencing , Amy started a blog “ Katie ’s Progress ” .
While the blog helps Amy and Paul keep family and friends up to date with Katie ’s developments , Amy has a higher purpose for it .
“ I want my blog to help spread cord blood awareness .
I want people to know how important it is to save cord blood for their children .
If you are expecting , you need to do the research and learn about your options . ”
She continues , “ We banked cord blood not thinking we would ever need it .
Here we are four years later , and it ’s totally helping our daughter . ”
Paul agrees , “ If you have children , there ’s nothing else you want to do but help them .
This is something we did and it ’s the best decision we ever made . ”
See Katie ’s progress for yourself !

NLP , or Neuro - Linguistic Processing , is a set of inter - and - intra - personal communication techniques first developed by psychotherapist Richard Bandler and linguist John Grinder ( who worked together under the tutelage of British anthropologist Gregory Bateson ) .
It ’s purpose was to discover the linguistic underpinnings of mental states and how they effect our behaviors , and to later use this knowledge to modify our habits .
It can be practiced through introspection ( now more scientifically known as metacognition ) or guided conversation .
Specifically , the goal of NLP is to model how others think and behave , including those who are creative .
What are the strategies a so - called “ creative person ” plays out in their heads ?
What is the structure of their experience , and what mental steps do they take before producing a creative outcome ?
Or , is it all spontaneous ?
And if so , how does one increase the chances of such a spontaneity occurring ?
These are the types of questions an NLP practitioner would ask .
The Disney Creative Strategy
The most popular NLP technique designed to enhance creativity is the “ Disney Strategy , ” ( 4 page PDF ) first modeled by Robert Dilts based on his conversations with filmmaker Walt Disney .
>” Dilts noticed that Disney had three separate approaches to his creative work and he alternated between these roles , which Dilts identified as Dreamer , Realist , and Critic .
Each role has a distinct orientation in relation to the creative process : the dreamer is the place of free association , brainstorming and even fantasies ; the realist is the place of action , of imagining putting the dreams into the physical world ; and the critic is the place of testing the soundness of your idea ’s , checking in on what will or wo n’t work . ”
Dilts believes that we each have a part of us that can identify with these roles .
However , some of us are more of one than another .
What happens if we do n’t find a balance ?
“ A dreamer without a realist cannot turn ideas into tangible expressions .
A critic and a dreamer without a realist just become stuck in a perpetual conflict .
A dreamer and a realist might create things , but they might not be very usable ideas without a critic .
The critic helps to evaluate and refine the products of creativity . ”
So the main question is : throughout the creative process how can we develop each of these roles ?
The answer Dilts provides says that we should set aside a time and place for each of these mental attitudes :
1. First put yourself in the role of The Dreamer .
Write down any and all ideas that come to mind .
Make as many freely associated connections as possible , let your thoughts just flow without any limitation or worry on how to put these ideas into action .
2 . Next put yourself in the role of The Realist .
Now ask yourself , “ How can I put these ideas into a reality ?
What resources ( money / time / skills ) do I need ? ”
Write these down .
3 . Then put yourself in the role of The Critic .
Now it is time to try and find the flaws of your strategy .
What do n’t you like ?
What potential obstacles are there ?
What needs improvement ?
Write these down .
4 . Now step outside your triangle of roles .
Observe your reaction to each – are you being a good Dreamer , Realist , and Critic ?
How can you improve each ?
5 . Cycle through each role again .
Using any insights from # 4 , cycle through the roles again , this time being an even better Dreamer , Realist , and Critic .
6 . Take your ideas to action
Do the above as many times as needed until you can begin putting your ideas to action .
Even as you carry out your plan , keep these three elements in mind at all times .
How much time you spend in each session is up to you .
I recommend at least 5 - 10 minutes of brainstorming , idea - jotting , and question - asking per role .
When I first tried this strategy I used to even light different - scented candles ; which became a self - conditioned stimuli ( an anchor , for those familiar with NLP lingo ) to help me get into each mindset .
You can use other habits ( or “ rituals “ ) to help amplify your creative roles as you practice them more and more .

Another Way To Deconstruct Creativity
The other day I came across an article on the blog Litemind called , “ Deconstructing Creativity : The 4 Roles You Need To Play To Be Fully Creative , ” and although I do n’t think the author Luciano Passuello intended it , his strategy is actually very similar to Walt Disney’s .
The 4 roles Luciano identifies are :
1. The Explorer ( be curious and alert , seek out as many inputs as possible , and talk to a lot of different people ) .
2 . The Artist ( flex your idea muscles , play , use your imagination , and integrate different concepts ) .
3 . The Judge ( be real , develop critical thinking , and be aware of thinking traps / biases ) .
4 . The Warrior ( get into action , overcome resistance , be courageous , and find out how to market and sell your idea ) .
Passuello does n’t mention NLP but , like in NLP , he creates a very thorough model of his own personal creative strategy .
Other possible models
1. Real world examples
Do you have a friend , family member , coworker , or acquaintance who you think makes a good Dreamer , Realist or Critic ?
Why not use that as a resource to improve your creative process ?
You ’d probably be surprised how much you can learn by pretending to think as someone else .
How does your physiology change ?
How do your thoughts change ?
How do your motivations change ?
2. Fictitious characters
Same thing as above , but this time pay attention to the thoughts and behaviors of characters in movies , TV , books , or plays .
Imagine yourself in those roles .
How does your physiology change ?
How do your thoughts change ?
How do your motivations change ?

SPLC publishes patriot hit list
April 21 , 2010
By Chuck Baldwin
In a report on its web site dated April 2010 , entitled " Meet The Patriots , " the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) profiled " 36 individuals at the heart of the resurgent [ patriot ] movement . "
( In reading the list , I counted only 35 " patriots " and 5 " enablers " for a total of 40 .
I 'm not really sure how the SPLC came up with " 36 . "
Perhaps their ability to count is commensurate with their ability to appreciate patriotism and liberty . )
The SPLC ( founded by Morris Dees ) sees itself as America 's guardian against " right wing militias " and loves to label conservatives and libertarians that it does n't like as " extremists . "
The SPLC is one of the most ultra-liberal organizations in the country and should be dismissed as a group of paranoid leftists , not worthy of thought or mention .
The sad truth is , however , our federal government has chosen to exalt the SPLC to the position of being its " go to " source for information regarding " potential domestic terrorists " and similar characterizations .
As a result , the information and reports disseminated by SPLC wind up in police reports and bulletins all over the United States .
As an example , the SPLC had its fingerprints all over the infamous MIAC report .
One could even question whether the SPLC is merely a front organization for Big Brother .
Therefore , it is highly likely that the report negatively profiling 40 American patriots will find its way into Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) fusion centers and be distributed to police agencies all across the country .
So , should the 40 people who find themselves targeted by SPLC expect some kind of government / police attention ?
Are we really that close to Nazi - style persecution in America ?
If the SPLC has its way , the answer seems to be a definite yes .
I remind readers that in the book , Nazi Justiz : Law of the Holocaust ( page 3 ) , there were five steps to Hitler 's plans for the destruction of European Jews .
Step 1 : Identification / registration of the targeted group as a public menace .
Step 2 : Ostracism of the targeted persons .
Step 3 : property confiscation .
Step 4 : Concentration of members into geographical locations .
Step 5 : Annihilation .
In this latest report , SPLC seems quite willing to accomplish steps 1 and 2 .
Here are the 40 names that are targeted in the SPLC report ( and guess who is listed at the very top ?
Yours truly ) : 1. Chuck Baldwin , Pastor , Radio Broadcaster , Syndicated Columnist , 2008 Constitution Party Presidential nominee .
2 . Joe Banister , former IRS special agent , tax protester .
3. Martin " Red " Beckman , tax protester4 .
Catherine Bleish , head of the Liberty Restoration Project .
5. Chris Broughton , Second Amendment advocate , member of " We The People " group .
6. Bob Campbell , head of American Grand Jury .
7 . Robert Crooks ,
Army veteran , retired commercial fisherman , anti-illegal immigration proponent .
8. Joseph Farah , CEO of World Net Daily9 .
Gary Franchi , producer of " Camp FEMA : American Lockdown , " national director of RestoreTheRepublic.com .10 .
Al Garza , head of the Patriot 's Coalition , an anti-illegal immigration group .
11 .
Ted Gunderson , retired FBI agent .
12 .
John Hassey , " The public face of Alabama 's militia movement in the late 1990s , " says SPLC .13 .
Alex Jones , Radio Talk
Show host .
14 .
Devvy Kidd , " prolific columnist , blogger , and public speaker .
" 15 . Larry Kilgore , telecommunications consultant , former US Senate candidate from Texas , pro-secession advocate .
16 .
Cliff Kincaid , syndicated columnist and author , editor of AIM Report ( Accuracy in Media 's publication ) , founder and president of America 's Survival , Inc. , a UN watchdog group .
17 .
Mark Koernke , associated with the now - defunct Michigan Militia .18 .
Richard Mack , former Graham County , Arizona , Sheriff , author , and public speaker .

36 .
Michele Bachmann , US Representative from Minnesota .37 .
Glenn Beck , Fox News Channel TV host .38 .
Paul Broun , medical doctor , US Representative from Georgia.39 .
Andrew Napolitano , attorney , former State judge in New Jersey , Fox News Channel legal analyist , lecturer .40 .
Ron Paul , former member of the US Air Force , medical doctor , US Representative from Texas , 2008 Republican candidate for President .
See the SPLC report here The SPLC , no doubt , sees each person on the above list as being a leader of the " radical right , " a " conspiracist , " and " antigovernment . "
But understand , the SPLC makes its living off of big - government , leftist ideology .
To say it is a shill for Big Government Liberalism is an understatement .
The SPLC is so radical it makes the ACLU look conservative !
Again , this SPLC report would not even merit a mention ( much less an entire column ) except for the fact that the SPLC has become a source of information fuelling anti-freedom hysteria for countless bureaucrats at the DHS .
Add this to the previously exposed MIAC and DHS reports , and the Army major 's report blaming " millennialist " Christians for much of the ills of the world , and a disturbing trend is quickly developing : so - called right - wing ANYTHING is being targeted and demonized as a " public menace .
" But the lists that you and I are not seeing are even more disturbing .
Joel Skousen quotes ( Radar Magazine's ) Christopher Ketcham 's The Last Roundup as asking if the federal government is " compiling a secret enemies list of citizens who could face detention ? "
He goes on to say , " A number of former government employees and intelligence sources with independent knowledge of domestic surveillance operations claim the program that caused the flap between [ former assistant attorney general under John Ashcroft , James ]
Comey and the White House was related to a database of Americans who might be considered potential threats in the event of a national emergency .
Sources familiar with the program say that the government 's data gathering has been overzealous and probably conducted in violation of federal law and the protection from unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment .
"
A veteran CIA intelligence analyst who maintains active high - level clearances and serves as an advisor to the Department of Defense in the field of emerging technology tells Radar that during the 2004 hospital room drama [ between former Chief of Staff Andrew Card and Attorney General Ashcroft , in an attempt by Card to coerce a very ill Ashcroft to authorize President Bush 's secretive domestic spying programs as his assistant  and acting  attorney general had refused to do so ] , James Comey expressed concern over how this secret database was being used ' to accumulate otherwise private data on non-targeted U.S. citizens for use at a future time .
'" The report further states , " According to a senior government official who served with high - level security clearances in five administrations , ' There exists a database of Americans , who , often for the slightest and most trivial reason , are considered unfriendly , and who , in a time of panic , might be incarcerated .
The database can identify and locate perceived " enemies of the state " almost instantaneously . ' "
At this point , Skousen noted , " And that is precisely why the census bureau took a GPS coordinate on every front door in America , secretly linking this to dissidents and their known addresses .
" This database of Americans who are perceived to be potential " enemies of the state " goes by the code name " Main Core . "
And according to the report , " One knowledgeable source claims that 8 million Americans are now listed in Main Core as potentially suspect .
In the event of a national emergency , these people could be subject to everything from heightened surveillance and tracking to direct questioning and possibly even detention .
" Officials at the Department of Homeland Security begin actively scrutinizing people who  for a tremendously broad set of reasons  have been flagged in Main Core as potential domestic threats [ sound familiar ? ] .
Some of these individuals might receive a letter or a phone call , others a request to register with local authorities .
Still others might hear a knock on the door and find police or armed soldiers outside .
In some instances , the authorities might just ask a few questions .
Other suspects might be arrested and escorted to federal holding facilities , where they could be detained without counsel until the state of emergency is no longer in effect .
"
The report also noted that former Assistant Attorney General James Comey " had concluded that the use of that ' Main Core ' database compromised the legality of the overall NSA domestic surveillance project .
' If Main Core does exist , ' says Philip Giraldi , a former CIA counterterrorism officer and an outspoken critic of the agency , ' the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) is its likely home .
If a master list is being compiled , it would have to be in a place where there are no legal issues  the CIA and FBI would be restricted by oversight and accountability laws  so I suspect it is at DHS , which as far as I know operates with no such restraints . '
Giraldi notes that DHS already maintains a central list of suspected terrorists and has been freely adding people who pose no reasonable threat to domestic security .
" So , is there a secret list of 8 million " unfriendly " Americans kept by DHS ( if there is , dear reader , you are probably on it ! ) ?
Does anyone reading this column doubt that our federal government is more than willing and capable of doing such a thing ?
All of us are quite familiar with the government 's " no fly " or " flagged " airline passenger list .
I can personally attest to the authenticity of this list , as airport officials in San Antonio , Texas , told me that I 'm on it .
I also made it to the " list of three " that were named in the MIAC report ( the other two were Ron Paul and Bob Barr ) .
And now I am on the SPLC list of " patriots " ( not a compliment in the SPLC lexicon ) .
Wow !
I never realize how popular I was !
( With the exception of Ron Paul , I 'm probably on more lists than anyone in America . )
Who would ever have thought that the day would come in America when to speak up for freedom , constitutional government , and the principles expressed by our Founding Fathers would land one on a government watch list ?
Well , that day is here , my friend !
No doubt , the major media and federal government  in order to further ostracize patriotic , God-fearing Americans  will use the SPLC patriot hit list as a vehicle to carry our country further down the road of oppression .
But what the radical left fearmongers at the Southern Poverty Law Center fail to realize is that the more they try to marginalize and ostracize American patriots such as you and me , the more they isolate themselves from America 's future , because millions and millions of hard - working , God-fearing , liberty - loving Americans are not going to sit back and let Morris Dees and his cabal of Big Government elitists destroy the principles of freedom in our land .
So , people such as Morris Dees can put us on as many lists as they like ; we will never let liberty die !
And the more they try to demonize us , the more people will want to join with us .
You see , freedom burns deep and strong in the hearts of real Americans .
And that 's something the SPLC can't extinguish  no matter how many lists it makes !©

Susan Williams was fielding questions from about 100 local voters A Conservative candidate has been criticised after she answered a question from her husband during a BBC election debate in Greater Manchester .
Susan Williams , standing for Bolton West , was asked about the budget deficit by her husband , Alex .
The Liberal Democrats said it was a " bit cheeky " and the Labour Party described it as " very disappointing " .
Mr Williams , also a Tory candidate in Stretford and Urmston , said " supporters for other candidates were there " .
Mrs Williams fielded the question during an election debate involving voters in Bolton broadcast on the BBC News Channel .
She said debate chairman Gavin Esler allowed her husband , who was in the audience , to ask a question and she remained adamant the BBC knew he would be there .
A North West Labour Party spokesman added : " The debate was an opportunity to give local people the chance to have their say .
In this case as this person is also standing in another Greater Manchester seat at the general election it's all the more surprising and disappointing
North West Labour Party spokesman
" It 's very disappointing that the Conservative Party feel the need to drop in a candidate 's spouse into the audience to ask a question while passing themselves off as a member of the public .
" In this case , as this person is also standing in another Greater Manchester seat at the general election , it 's all the more surprising and disappointing . "
However , the Conservative Party has defended Mr Williams ' actions , saying : " There were no restrictions on who these individuals were .
Supporters of other candidates were there . "
Mr Williams added : " My name was submitted beforehand and the organisers were aware of my presence . "
The BBC said Mr Williams ' question was not one of those submitted beforehand and was asked without its prior knowledge .
Candidates announced so far : • Bolton West : Labour : Julie Hilling ; UK Independence Party : Harry Lamb ; Green Party : Rachel Mann ; Liberal Democrat : Jackie Pearcey ; Conservative : Susan Williams • Stretford and Urmston : Liberal Democrat : Stephen Cooke ; Labour : Kate Green ; UK Independence Party : David Owen ; Green Party : Margaret Westbrook ; Conservative : Alex Williams

Have you ever wondered what your mouse is doing when it ’s moving around all day as you work ?
Well with a cool app called IOGraphica , you can do exactly that on a Mac or Windows PC .
The end result is quite interesting as you can see from the pictures .
IOGraph is a really cool program that runs in the background and tracks all of the movements and pauses of your mouse ( or trackpad ) as you use your Mac .
You can then export the mouse tracks into an image file with either the movements overlayed on your desktop workspace or just as an individual tracking graph .
It ’s most interesting when you launch the app and let it run for hours while you go about your day , coming back to it later to see where your mouse has been most active .
The black dots are mouse pauses and grow based on the length of the pause , but you can configure IOGraph ’s tracking to not include this in the images it produces if you ’d rather not see them .
So other than being cool and producing interesting images , is there a use for IOGraph ?
I would say yes , particularly for application , web , and GUI developers .
Imagine having beta testers run IOGraph over your designs so that you can see how people interact with your app , and what works and what does n’t ?
This is made possible across all platforms too , since IOGraph is available not just for Mac OS X , but also for Linux and Windows .
Even if you do n’t use IOGraph for anything productive , it ’s still fun to play around with , and it ’s definitely fun to see what your mouses tracking behavior and movements are in relation to what you do on your Mac throughout the day .

How do they get away with it ?
That ’s the inevitable question as I examine one of the most specious – and despicable – “ climategate ” allegations from contrarians , namely the oft - repeated claim that climate scientists at East Anglia University ’s Climate Research Unit inappropriately adjusted certain tree - ring temperature proxy data to provide a better match with instrumental temperature record .
In an extraordinary interview with FoxNews in December of last year , economist Ross McKitrick alleged that scientists were “ faking the match ” between proxy and temperature data .
McKitrick averred this was “ not being honest with the reader ” and even invoked a comparison to falsified experimental medical research .
Stephen McIntyre of ClimateAudit recently claimed that the “ artificial correction ” seemed “ to have entered the CRU toolkit ” ( in his submission to the U.K. parliamentary committee examining allegations arising from stolen CRU emails , no less ) .
Yet a close examination of the computer code and ensuing research bears out the key contention of the firm rebuttals from East Anglia University , as well as CRU scientist Tim Osborn , namely that the specific adjustments in question were for private exploration only and never incorporated into CRU scientists ’ subsequent published research temperature reconstructions .
So , once again , McIntyre and McKitrick have made odious and unfounded accusations , based on non-existent evidence .
They should withdraw these specious allegations immediately .
Most readers will recall that among the “ climategate ” documents stolen last November from East Anglia ’s Climate Research Unit , were a number of research computer programs , with code and comments that appeared to show the use of a “ fudge factor ” to “ artificially correct ” tree ring - data after 1960 .
A number of bloggers , led by Anthony Watts , fell over themselves to bring forth this supposed “ smoking gun ” proof of fraudulence perpetrated by scientists .
As the furor over the stolen emails and documents mounted , Fox News prepared a one - hour documentary , provocatively entitled Global Warming … or a Lot of HotAir ?
The program was based largely on interviews with McKitrick and McIntyre ( as well as Patrick Michaels ) , and aired a few days before Christmas .
The program was subsequently archived at WattsUpWithThat in six convenient segments ( unfortunately , the links are no longer operative due to flagrant copyright violation ) .
The remote split - screen interview with McKitrick is in the third segment and appears to have been conducted with McKitrick in his book - lined office at the University of Buckingham ( where he was visiting professor until January ) .
At around 3:30 of that segment , the documentary discusses the “ fudge factor ” .
FOXNews narrator :
Then there is the suggestion that climate scientists were improperly massaging their data .
It ‘s found within the computer codes that they used in their temperature research .
One program contained information referred to as a fudge factor .
FOXNews interviewer : Can you explain what the fudge factor is ?
Ross McKitrick :
The fudge factor is actually a line written into a computer program at the Climate Resaerch Unit , where they ’ve run into a problem with their data .
They want to fit some tree - ring proxy data to their temperature data , but the tree - ring proxy data goes in one direction ; it goes down , and the temperature data is going up .
Narrator :
In other words , at times the tree -ring data and the temperature did n’t match .
The thermometers said warmer , and the tree-ring said cooler .
Interviewer :
It almost sounds like it ’s faking it .
McKitrick :
It ’s faking the match .
The problem is , if they have n’t explained that they use this fudge factor to force it to match , then it ’s not being honest with the reader .
Narrator : Another programmer note reads , “ These will be artificially adjusted to look closer to the real temperatures ” .
Interviewer :
Do all scientists do this ?
McKitrick : I sure hope not .
I mean where would we be in medical science , for instance , if they took all the people that died from the experimental treatment and just recoded so it looks like they got better .
A few minutes later , a denial is desultorily displayed :
The University of East Anglia added that the “ fudge factor ” computer codes were never used for published articles or data and defended the Climatic Research Unit ’s work , as its director , Phil Jones , has temporarily stepped aside for a university investigation , and the world has learned that the Unit had discarded much of its temperature data .
Aside from the obvious implication that the University denial is untrustworthy , since the head of CRU is “ under investigation ” , note that Fox introduces the canard that CRU had discarded “ much of its temperature data ” , data which was not actually CRU ’s , and not relevant to the research discussed in any event .
Naturally , the debate about the “ fudge factor ” has become a key part of the U.K. parliamentary Science and Technology Committee investigation of the stolen CRU documents .
In a submission to that committee , CRU paleoclimatologist Tim Osborn gave a detailed explanation of the matter .
8. CRU ’s Computer Code is Fit For Purpose and Does Not Reveal Secret Manipulation of Data
A small sample of my computer programming code was included in the disclosed files .
It has been argued that comments within the code such as “ Fudge factor ” and “ should n’t usually plot past 1960 because these will be artificially adjusted to look closer to the real temperatures ” demonstrate that data have been manipulated in an inappropriate and undisclosed manner .
My programs that were highlighted on BBC Newsnight that contained comments such as these were not the basis for any published article or dataset , and thus are not a valid indication of inappropriate data manipulation .
If we do need to make adjustments to data that are scientifically justified , then we state clearly both the justification and the adjustment when we publish the article or dataset .
In relation to the second of the two highlighted comments , it was simply a note that should have read “ … because these will have been artificially adjusted … ” to remind myself that I had applied an adjustment to this particular set of data ( for the purposes of exploring the consequences of recent trends for the calibration of tree - ring temperature proxies ) and that if I did plot them it would give a false impression of the agreement between tree - rings and temperature because of the adjustment .
Thus , rather than indicating that an undisclosed adjustment would be made , it was a warning to avoid using adjusted data without realising it .
To re-iterate : I have made no adjustments to data except those that are scientifically justified and stated in published papers .
[ Emphasis added ] .
Yet despite these convincing and forthright explanations , McIntyre forged ahead with his own reckless accusation in his submission to the parliamentary committee .
7 . One of the underlying problems in trying to use tree ring width / density chronologies for temperature reconstructions is a decline in 20th century values at many sites – Briffa ’s 1992 density ( MXD ) chronology for the influential Tornetrask site is shown at left below .
The MXD chronology had a very high correlation to temperature , but went down in the 20th century relative to what it was “ expected ” to do and relative to the ring width ( RW ) chronology ( which had a lower correlation to temperature . )
So Briffa “ adjusted ” the MXD chronology , by a linear increase to the latter values ( middle ) , thereby reducing the medieval - modern differential .
This adjustment was described in private as the “ Briffa bodge ” … “ Bodging ” then seems to entered [ sic ] into the CRU toolkit to get reconstructions to “ look ” right , as evidenced by the Climategate documents containing annotations that the method contains “ fudge factors ” or “ very artificial corrections for decline ” ( e.g. …
;****** APPLIES A VERY ARTIFICIAL CORRECTION FOR DECLINE ********* [ Emphasis added ]
Although neither McKitrick and McIntyre gave any specific instances where this undisclosed “ method ” to get “ reconstructions to look right ” had actually been used in subsequently published research , that inference was very clear .
And McIntyre even implies that this was a regular occurrence , as the manipulation was supposedly part of the “ CRU toolkit ” .
So there is a clear conflict between the fanciful accusations from McIntyre and McKitrick on the one hand , and the actual CRU explanations on the other .
However , for the benefit of anyone still in doubt that Osborn is more credible than McKitrick or McIntyre , I ’ll now look a little more deeply at some of the actual code .
The computer program in question is the very one from which McIntyre quoted ( briffa_sep98_e.pro , apparently written by Ian Harris of CRU ) .
John Graham - Cumming discussed the “ artificial correction ” as implemented in that particular program back in November .
He explains how the correction table is used to create a linear interpolation and adjust MXD ( maximum latewood density ) according to year .
Up to 1924 , proxy values are unaffected , while post - 1960 values are boosted considerably .
Clearly , as Graham - Cumming surmised , the point was to study an aspect of the well - known “ divergence problem “ , whereby the MXD proxy at high - latitude locations show marked divergence from local temperatures in the late twentieth century .
But was this program actually used in published research ?
Or rather was it used merely for the exploration of calibration issues , as Osborn stated ?
Looking at the code , one can see that two methods for standardizing tree - ring series were compared ( standardization is a necessary step in combing individual tree - ring samples into a site or regional series ) .
printf , 1 , 'Correlations between timeseries ' printf , 1 , 'Age - banded vs. Hugershoff - standardised ' printf , 1 , ' Region Full < 10 > 10 > 30 > 50 > 100 '
As we have seen before , multi-centennial reconstructions using tree - ring proxies need to account for age - related growth characteristics ( usually younger trees grow faster than older ones ) , but in a way that preserves “ low frequency ” information as much as possible .
( Hugershoff standardization on the other hand , preserves detailed interannual variation , suitable for , say , studying the relationship between temperature and volcanic eruptions ) .
Keith Briffa ’s “ regional curve standardization ” ( RCS ) is the best known technique for accomplishing this low - frequency retention , but requires large amounts of tree - ring data from a single species in a realatively prescribed region .
So Briffa and Osborn also proposed an alternative “ age - band decomposition ” ( ABD ) as a compromise technique for situations where RCS would lead to unacceptable uncertainty levels .
The technique was first described in a 2001 JGR paper , “ Low - frequency temperature variations from a northern tree ring density network ” , co-authored with Osborne , Harris , Phil Jones and three other researchers .
In a useful summary of this and other papers , available at the CRU site , Osborn states :
The MXD measurement series from individual tree cores were processed using the Age - Band Decomposition method introduced and described in this paper .
The rationale for this new method is that if data are initially analysed and combined within relatively narrow ranges of tree age , then it is no longer necessary to detrend individual tree - core time series to remove any dependence on tree age .
This detrending , which is part of traditional standardisation techniques , results in the loss of variance on long time scales that might be caused by changing climate .
Because the Age - Band Decomposition method does not require this detrending step , the reconstructions obtained with it have stronger variance on longer time scales .
The method may introduce different types of uncertainty compared with traditional standardisation methods , especially when the sample of tree - ring measurements is small , so we consider that the regional and hemispheric reconstructions produced using this method are more appropriate for the study of climate variations on multi-decadal time scales and longer .
It seems that the Briifa_se p98_e program is early exploratory work using ABD with these same chronologies .
The program lists the chronology data sets to be opened and plotted :
harryfn= [ ' nwcan ' , 'wnam ' , 'cecan ' , 'nweur ' , ' sweur ' , 'nsib ' , 'csib ' , ' tib ' , $ ' esib ' , 'allsites ' ]
The 2001 paper gives nine MXD regional northern hemisphere chronologies .
By the time of the paper , the acronyms identifying the chronologies have changed , although the regions they represent are recognizably the same ones .
Here ’s the caption from the polar map of the regions studied :
Figure 1 . Locations ( circles ) of the 387 tree ring density chronologiesto , getherw ith the boundaries of the nine arbitrary regions : NEUR , northernE urope ; SEUR , southernE urope ; NSIB , northern Siberia ; ESIB , eastern Siberia ; CAS , central Asia ; TIBP , Tibetan Plateau ; WNA , western North America ; NWNA , northwestern North America ; ECCA , eastern and central Canada .
But the actual paper , far from using manipulation ( undisclosed or otherwise ) to force a match between post - 1960 MXD data and temperature , examines the effect of different combining techniques on the full time range of the series , up to 1994 , clearly showing overall “ divergence ” between the instrumental temperature record and proxies in the late 20th century .
And the paper also states the proxy data for many chronolgies after 1960 was unreliable and should not be used for calibration ; this period was also excluded for the various cross-comparisons between regional chronologies and with other reconstructions .
The period after 1960 was not used to avoid bias in the regression coefficients that could be generated by an anomalous decline in tree density measurements over recent decades that is not forced by temperature [ B riffa et al. , 1998 b ] .
So at no point , was the “ manipulation ” in the above exploratory computer program used in this particular published research .
And , since this paper appears to be the only one that discusses these nine regional chronologies and ABD in any detail , the inevitable conclusion is that there exists no evidence of any published research that may have used the output of the Briffa_Sep98 _E program specifically referred to by McIntyre .
None whatsoever .
If either McIntyre or McKitrick had any evidence at all to back up their accusations , surely they would have released it by now .
Now there is only one course of action open to them .
McIntyre and McKitrick must withdraw , immediately and unequivocally , their false accusations .
And they must also publicly apologize to Keith Briffa , Tim Osborn , Ian Harris and Phil Jones , as well as to East Anglia University and its unjustly maligned Climate Research Unit .
Palin defends Karzai , echoes Cheney
Sarah Palin , whose complaints about nuclear policy President Obama brushed off yesterday , delivered an extended attack on Obama 's foreign policy that closely followed Liz Cheney 's criticism at the same Southern Republican Leadership Conference yesterday .
" In foreign policy now we ’ve got the makings of the Obama doctrine , which is coddling enemies and alienating allies , " Palin said .
Palin attacked Obama across the waterfront of foreign policy issues , saying that he'd been soft on Chavez and China while they were able to only " barely muster " support for Iranian protesters .
" Now President Obama , with all the vast nuclear experience that he acquired as a community organizer and as a full - time candidate — still no accomplishment to date with North Korea and Iran , " she said .
And echoing Cheney 's new line , Palin linked the spats with the Israeli leadership and with Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
" They treated the Afghan president poorly and then they feigned surprise when he reacted in kind , " she said .
Martin Scorsese ’s Shutter Island is the first great film of 2010 .
( Yes , I know it ’s really a 2009 film that was held back till now . )
I say that in full knowledge of the fact that a lot of people will hate the film .
I ’ve already heard a good many complaints about it — most of them grounded in the fact that the viewer was able to guess the “ twist ” ending long before the end of the movie .
Hell , I went into the movie almost certain that I knew what the twist was — and I was right .
So what ?
If all the movie had going for it was a twist ending , it would n’t be much of a movie .
We are after all talking about Martin Scorsese here , not M. Night Shyamalan .
Put it this way , if you dislike Hitchcock ’s Vertigo ( 1958 ) because it reveals much of its mystery long before the ending , you ’re probably not going to like this movie either .
The film is set in 1954 and starts with U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) and his new partner Chuck Aule ( Mark Ruffalo ) aboard a ferry headed for the titular island that houses a maximum - security institution for the criminally insane .
The reason for their journey is that one of the patients — a delusional child murderess — has inexplicably disappeared in classic mystery locked - room - puzzle style , and they have been brought in to find her .
But nothing seems quite right about any of this .
The head of the facility , Dr. Cawley ( Ben Kingsley as the embodiment of every overly - cultured film - noir authority figure ) , is more a hindrance than a help at nearly every turn .
His right - hand man , the constantly probing Dr. Naehring ( Max Von Sydow ) , is sinister and German .
The latter — combined with Naehring ’s choice of music on the record player at their first meeting — makes Teddy suspicious of a possible Nazi past .
And yet we ’re given hint after hint that things are n’t what they seem and do n’t add up as they should .
Teddy has memories of being one of the liberators of Dachau and recognizes the music as Gustav Mahler ’s String Quartet — an odd choice for the commandant of a concentration camp , given the Jewish composer , and an obscure choice for anyone , since it ’s a rarely played unfinished work ( only one movement was completed ) .
Things become more off - center as Teddy has nightmares that mix up the liberation of Dachau with his wife ’s death in an apartment fire set by a pyromaniac , Laeddis ( Elias Koteas ) , who , according to Teddy , was sent to Shutter Island and then simply vanished .
Or did he ?
Could Laeddis be the 67th patient Dr. Cawley insists does n’t exist ?
And why is Teddy ’s wife Dolores ( Michelle Williams ) dripping wet in his dreams if she died in a fire ?
Everything — even the unreal , 1950s process - work look of the ferry ride to the island — is geared to make Teddy and the viewer increasingly confused about what is and what is n’t real .
However , both we as viewers and Teddy are given the very hints we need to unravel things — the question really is why and to what point ?
Where is the increasingly nightmarish vision taking us ?
If Inglourious Basterds was what you get when a pop-culture moviemaker like Quentin Tarantino gets his movie geek on , Shutter Island might be said to be what you get when a master filmmaker gets his movie geek on .
The references are different and they run deeper — and they ’re more infused into the film .
There are echoes of a number of noir films — especially the post - war ones with their added aura of disillusionment — and there ’s a lot of Hitchcock on display , from Spellbound ( 1945 ) to Vertigo .
Part of the central premise — with behavior that only makes sense at the end — may even owe a debt to Roland West ’s The Bat Whispers ( 1930 ) .
I felt intimations of Patrick McGoohan ’s The Prisoner TV series , too , and I ’d not be in the least surprised if Scorsese has seen Ken Russell ’s TV film The Mystery of Dr. Martinu ( 1991 ) .
Shutter Island is a film to be seen more than once — I ’ve seen it twice already — and a film to be savored .
It reveals new depths and undercurrents at every turn .
On my first viewing , I thought the long flashback at the end was too long .
On my second , it seemed fine .
And as far as the twist is concerned , do n’t get so wrapped up in it that you miss the double - whammy real twist at the very end — and the moral ambiguity inherent in it .

Silicon Valley 's rise as the hub of the technology industry in the 1960s coincided with LSD 's explosion on the cultural scene .
Within a few miles of Stanford Research Center ( SRI ) , where Douglas Englebart was envisioning the personal computer as a mechanism to " augment human intelligence , " three organizations were then legally administering LSD to guinea pigs .
The Veterans Administration Hospital in Menlo Park and the Palo Alto Mental Research Institute were studying LSD to better understand schizophrenia .
Meanwhile , the International Foundation for Advanced Study , founded by a former engineer , sought to give credibility to LSD 's mind - expanding properties .
These organizations offered leaders of the counterculture ( Ken Kesey , Allen Ginsberg ) and some of the personal computer industry 's founding fathers their first communions with acid .
No doubt , their mind - blowing experiences influenced the communal ethos of the early personal computing industry and later the open source software movement .

Rig listing after explosion in Gulf of Mexico , but most workers escape unhurt
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Helicopters , ships and an aeroplane searched the waters off Louisiana 's coast today for at least 11 workers missing after an explosion and fire that left an offshore drilling platform tilting in the Gulf of Mexico .
Most of the 126 people on the rig , Deepwater Horizon , were believed to have escaped safely after the explosion last night , a coast guard officer , Mike O'Berry , said .
The rig , about 52 miles south - east of Venice on Louisiana 's tip , was still burning this morning .
It was listing about 70 degrees and threatening to topple into the water .
" It 's burning pretty good and there 's no estimate on when the fire will be put out , " O'Berry said .
Seven workers were reported critically injured and two taken to a trauma centre in Alabama , another coastguard officer , Sue Kerver said .
O'Berry said many workers who escaped the rig were being brought to land on a workboat while the Gulf of Mexico was searched for signs of lifeboats .
" We 're hoping everyone 's in a life raft , " he said .
Greg Panagos , a spokesman for the rig's owner , Transocean Ltd , said it was drilling but not in production .
The rig was under contract to BP Plc , whose spokesman , Darren Beaubo , said all BP personnel were safe , though he did not know how many BP workers had been on the rig .
Panagos said it was still too early to tell the cause .
" Our focus right now is on taking care of the people . "
O'Berry said coastguard environmental teams were on standby to assess any environmental damage once the fire was out .
The Deepwater Horizon rig , built in 2001 , is 120 metres long and 78 metres wide .
The site known as the Macondo prospect , is in 1,500 metres of water .
The rig is designed to operate in water depths up to 2,500 metres and has a maximum drill depth of about 5.5 miles .
It can accommodate a crew of up to 130 .

Court Says President Bush Violated Wiretapping Laws With Warrantless Wiretap

" Plaintiffs must , and have , put forward enough evidence to establish a prima facie case that they were subjected to warrantless electronic surveillance , " U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker ruled , in a landmark decision .
Even without the classified document , the judge said he believed the lawyers " were subjected to unlawful electronic surveillance " ( .pdf ) in violation of the Foreign Terror Surveillance Act , which requires warrants in terror investigations .

In aruling , a court has said that the US government violated wiretapping laws in eavesdropping on phone calls without a warrant .
If you have n't been following the fight over the legality of warrantless wiretapping , this case , involving lawyers working with the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , is extremely important .
When it was revealed that the Bush administration was wiretapping phonecalls without a warrant , lawsuits were filed -- but the " problem " was that the parties ( such as the ACLU ) that filed the lawsuits did n't have " standing " because they had no evidence that they , personally , were impacted by the warrantless wiretapping .
This created a ridiculous Catch - 22 situation .
As long as the government hid its illegal activities and never said who it spied on , it could spy on anyone illegally .
No one could bring a lawsuit , since there was no proof that they had been impacted by the illegal spying .
Then the feds screwed up .
Theysent the evidence of wiretapping some lawyers for the Al - Haramain group to those lawyers .
Suddenly there was evidence .
But , of course , the government tried to cover it up .
For a while it claimed that even though it had revealed that it had illegally spied on these lawyers , and everyone knew it , since those documents were classified , everyone had to pretend that it was still a secret and no one knew about it .
This resulted in a series of positively ridiculous hoops that lawyers had to jump through to bring the case , without actually using the document .
Thankfully , even as the Obama administration continued to support the Bush 's administration 's position that this lawsuit should not move forward , the courts disagreed and allowed the case to move forward although the document in question was n't allowed to be used .
However , the judge , who was clearly annoyed by the administration 's stalling tactics , said that even without the document , there was enough evidence that the federal government violated wiretapping laws :
Beyond that , the judge called the administration 's method of dealing with the case as " argumentative acrobatics , " and even suggested that those suing could ask for monetary damages .
This is a huge victory against illegal government surveillance .
There is simply no excuse for the government to violate its own laws , especially when it comes to infringing on the privacy rights of American citizens .
There is a well - established process for obtaining legal wiretap warrants .
There is no excuse for going around that process , other than that the government knows it 's doing something wrong .
Thankfully , the judge recognized that in this case .

Okay , so I ’m kind of a perv for noticing this .
Let ’s just get that out of the way right now .
I was watching my DVDs for the umpteenth time when I noticed something peculiar .
I have little way of knowing if this is already out there .
A web search of the terms girlfriend and topless yields a dizzying array of results .
But , I did my best and from what I can tell I may be one of the first to have noticed this .
I suspect Herr McCulloch ( aka Jackson Publick ) and Doc Hammer may gone through puberty desperately needing to touch some girl parts because there ’s this sequence in the penultimate episode of the third season of The Venture Bros .
In “ The Family That Slays Together , Stays Together ” Part I , about four minutes from the closing credits , Dr. Girlfriend is sitting on Brock Samson ’s bed , waiting for him to enter the room .
She ’s propped herself up and is adjusting her costume when she has * drum roll * a wardrobe malfunction .
And out pops one of her dirty pillows .
Hooray for super science !

There 's a problem with the All - Star Game .
( Which All - Star Game ?
Baseball , duh . )
Players get on the team via a popularity contest , which would be fine if the game was just an exhibition .
Alas , the game counts now , as an overreaction to Bud leaving the 2002 game as a tie .
If the game is going to count , then it should be played by the actual best players , not fan favorites .
Now , personally , I would be happiest with the game as an exhibition game .
I do n't see the point in the present meaningful game .
To a very real extent , it could be abusive to non-contenting teams .
But let 's say we 're sticking with the meaningful all - Star Game .
What would those teams look like ?
How would we pick ?
The most convenient way would be to use WAR ( Wins Above Replacement ) .
Is WAR perfect ?
No .
But it 's good enough for a blog post no one will read .
So let 's use ESPN 's list , for the sole reason that it 's the first one I found .
I 'm going to follow Gold Glove rules and just use the top three outfielders , instead of worrying about which field they play .
I 'm also going to use the best pitcher as the starting pitcher and the next three as relief .
( On the theory that relief pitchers are just failed starters . )
I left closers out , as there were n't any in the top one hundred players , and I tired of looking for them .
I also left out the DH , despite this year 's game being held at Target Field , because the DH is an abomination .
So , here 's what we get :
Position American League National League Catcher Salvador Perez ( Royals ) Jonathan Lucroy ( Brewers ) First Base Brandon Moss ( A's ) Paul Goldschmidt ( Diamondbacks ) Second Base Brian Dozier ( Twins ) Chase Utley ( Phillies ) Shortstop Alexei Ramirez ( White Sox ) Troy Tulowitzki ( Rockies ) Third Base Josh Donaldson ( A's ) Todd Frazier ( Reds ) Outfield Mike Trout ( Angels ) Giancarlo Stanton ( Marlins ) Outfield Alex Gordon ( Royals ) Andrew McCutchen ( Pirates ) Outfield Jose Bautista ( Blue Jays ) A.J. Pollock ( Diamondbacks ) Starting Pitcher Dallas Keuchel ( Astros ) Johnny Cueto ( Reds ) Relief Yu Darvish ( Rangers ) Adam Wainwright ( Cardinals ) Relief Masahiro Tanaka ( Yankees ) Tim Hudson ( Giants ) Relief Mark Buehrle ( Blue Jays ) Julio Teheran ( Braves )
Seeing Dozier in there was a pleasant surprise for this die - hard Twins fan !
Feel free to compare these with the actual All - Star Game voting .
There may be various rules keeping some players listed above from being considered for the voting .
I just do n't know .
Overall , though , the All - Star Game voting is clearly a popularity contest .
I think that 's fine , for an exhibition game .
I think it 's crappy , for a game that counts .

I love watching the MLB Network .
It 's the only TV channel I watch with any regularity .
I also like most of the on-air personalities .
I love Mitch Williams .
Mitch knows about what he 's talking , but he 's not a dick about it .
In fact , he hides it behind an aww - shucks country boy demeanor .
The antithesis of Mitch is Brian Kenny , a man who does not really know his own subject matter , yet is insufferably smug .
( Watching Kenny is a little like watching Dubya talk about foreign policy , or about anything , for that matter . )
Now , I 'm no expert on Kenny .
He annoys me so that I try hard to limit my exposure to him .
Given that , here 's a sampling of why I dislike him and think he 's basically a smug moron .
1 ) Home Run Trots
I first noticed that Kenny is n't all that smart in the context of home run trots .
Some player had trotted around the bases rather slowly and had received some criticism .
Kenny 's response was that David Ortiz had the slowest time in the majors in terms of circling the bases after a home run .
So , if that time is okay for Big Papi , then any time below that is also okay .
I know .
WTF ?
Apparently the fact that Ortiz is a huge slow guy does n't factor into this at all for Kenny .
You can be the fastest guy in baseball , but as long as you circle the bases post - home - run faster than the slowest guy , you 're not showing any disrespect ?
At first , I thought I had misheard .
Surely Kenny meant some sort of ratio of base circling time to , I dunno , time to first base under duress ?
( I made up the terms .
It 's the concept that 's important . )
Something like that would be useful .
If you want to gauge disrespect , the ratio of how fast a guy trots to how fast he can actually run would seem a good measure .
Yet , later that week , on a different show , he made the same claim !
At that point , it became obvious that he was n't someone I wanted to spend much time watching .
Yet , sometimes we would catch the end of his show while waiting for the next one .
Even given that limited exposure , I 'd still see things like ...
2 ) Misplaced Zero Sums
Problem two came up in the context of whether it's harder to pitch and hit in the 9th inning compared to earlier in the game .
Players say yes , to both .
Kenny smugly proclaims that , logically , it can't be both .
Huh ?
Did he think effort was some kind of zero sum game ?
What if I poke out an eye from both the pitcher and batter ?
I guarantee you it 'll be harder for both of them .
It 's this sort of thing that really bothers me .
He 's so smug while saying things that show he has n't really thought through the implications of his statements .
3 ) The Shredder
So , the MLB Network has some statistical model called The Shredder that they use to rank players .
That 's fine .
Maybe it 's a good model .
Maybe it 's a shitty model .
That 's not the point .
The point is that Kenny totes it as being unbiased .
Again , WTF ?
Any statistical model is going to be a conglomeration of human decisions on how to weight different factors .
This is all open to bias .
The benefit is that the model will be consistently biased .
The idea is that you can later compare the results of your model against real world results and tweak the model to become better , slowly eliminating bias .
( Whether they do this with The Shredder is an open question . )
But you 'll never eliminate bias .
This is part of a broader misunderstanding on Kenny 's part about statistics .
He 's often shown in sound bite form telling us that the newer statistical methods give the true story .
They do n't .
They give a truer story .
( Ten years from now , we 'll have even better methods that will give an even more truer story . )
The only true story is reality .
You see this in George E. P .
Box 's observation that Essentially , all models are wrong , but some are useful .
Now , I know , I 'm being a little harsh .
I 'm wrong about stuff all the damn time .
Unlike Kenny , I try hard to not be so smugly self - satisfied while doing it .
Except here , in this post , obviously .

I used to feel bad about giving up on a book , but then I realized that life was too short to waste on mediocre books .
Here 's one I gave up on two - thirds of the way through .
Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville : A Lifelong Passion for Baseball
So , Stephen Jay Gould is an ace writer when it comes to science .
Apparently , he also wrote several essays about baseball .
This book is a collection of those essays , published after his death .
( Or , y' know , posthumously . )
Alas , it 's not very good .
There are several problems with it .
First off is the posthumously nature .
Gould had no opportunity to make sure that the various essays melded in any way into a full book , and so they do n't .
It 's not just that there 's no flow .
There 's also an aching amount of repetition .
We have to hear over and over about particulars of his boyhood .
We have to read the same jokes and snarky comments repeatedly .
As separate essays , this is n't a problem .
But it sure gets boring when you jam all those essays together .
A second problem is his fawning over players .
There are several times when he simply gushes about how great Mark McGwire is , without even a glance at the obvious role steroids played .
And , no , I 'm not looking with 20 / 20 hindsight .
If you looked at McGwire during his heyday and did n't think of steroids , you 're just oblivious .
Unfortunately , Gould was oblivious .
More amusing was his blind faith that Chuck Knoblauch would soon conquer his tragic case of the yips .
( Not to suggest that what happened to Chuck was amusing .
Make no mistake , Chuck was an ass , but he was also a damn fine ballplayer . )
The third problem is his wordiness .
He takes far too long to explain simple concepts .
The worst offender is his essay on why there will never be another .400 hitter .
Want to know why ?
Here 's why :
Baseball modifies the game itself to keep the average batting average at .260 .
As the sport continues to mature , average players get better while the very best hit a wall .
This decreases the gap between the average and the very best .
Because the game is continually modified to keep that average player at .260 , even the very best players can no longer reach .400 .
In short , the game is graded on a curve and the improvement of average players blows the curve .
Now , that is n't a quote from the book .
Oh , no .
That 's my quick paraphrase .
The book contains a long essay to explain a fairly simple concept .
Towards the end , there 's some interesting statistics to back up the argument , but by then I was so bored I really did n't care .
Fourth is his overuse of religion .
Jesus , the guy uses Christian religious examples all the goddamn time !
It 's not that I mind religious mentions , and , in fact , they often work great as baseball metaphors .
But they 're sprinkled everywhere , and the guy is n't even a Christian .
It 's not that he 's making any fun of religion .
He 's n't .
( Double contraction of He is not . )
It 's just that his frequent use seems , I dunno , weird ?
Disrespectful in its assumption of the culture of others ?
Maybe it 's just me .
I was n't offended .
I just found it weird .
It detracted from the content .
The one time it really worked was in talking about Cooperstown , the Hall of Fame Museum , and the hybrid of cultural and historical artifacts .
Admittedly , this one was a good essay .
Fifth , book reviews !
Apparently , the last third of the book is just his reviews of other baseball books .
I read the first one .
It 's not great ; it 's not horrible .
It 's , frankly , about on par with my book reviews .
But mine are free .
This was the point at which I decided to read something else .

A decade ago , I wrote up this little page and stuck it on the Obsolete Computer Museum .
I 'm handing the Museum over to more capable hands , so I 'm preserving this page in this post .
What 's the Magic Number in baseball ?
It 's simply the number of games that the team leading a division needs to win to ensure winning the division .
If you 're leading the division with ten games remaining and your Magic Number is three , you only need to win three of those ten games to ensure winning the division .
Each time you win , your Magic Number goes down by one .
Each time your nearest divisional competitor loses , your Magic Number also goes down by one .
When your Magic Number hits zero , you 've clinched the division .
You calculate your Magic Number by looking at the number of games remaining in the season and assuming that your nearest competitor will win all of their remaining games .
Then you see how many games you still need to win to ensure the division title even with your nearest competitor winning all their remaining games .
Since the mighty Minnesota
Twins are still atop the AL Central , I thought I 'd start tracking their Magic Number .
So I searched around on the web and found two different methods of calculation .
One method , endorsed by Major League Baseball is to take the number of games remaining for the division leaders , add 1 , then subtract the difference in the number of losses between the leaders and the second place team .
In other words :
M = G 1 + 1 - ( L 2 - L 1 )
Another method , which I read on the web here , starts with the number of games remaining for the second place team , again adds 1 , then subtracts the difference in the wins between first and second place .
Or :
M = G 2 + 1 - ( W 1 - W 2 )
So , is either formula better than the other , or are they equivalent ?
And how am I just supposed to know how many games these teams have left to play ?
Well , we can replace the number of remaining games by the total number of games in the regular season ( 162 ) minus the number of games played so far , which is just wins plus losses .
For the Major League formula , this becomes :
M = ( 162 - ( W 1 + L 1 ) ) + 1 - ( L 2 - L 1 )
Which expands to :
M = 162 - W 1 - L 1 + 1 - L 2 + L 1
The L 1 cancels out , and the 162 and 1 combine , to leave :
M = 163 - W 1 - L 2
For the second method , we get :
M = ( 162 - ( W 2 + L 2 ) + 1 - ( W 1 - W 2 )
Which expands to :
M = 162 - W 2 - L 2 + 1 - W 1 + W 2
In this case , the W 2 cancels out .
The 162 and 1 still combine , leaving us with :
M = 163 - L 2 - W 1
Which is exactly what we ended up with using the Major League formula .
In closing , the Magic Number for a division - leading Major League Baseball team is simply 163 minus the number of wins the first place team has , then minus the number of losses the second place team has :
M = 163 - W 1 - L 2
( More detailed information about baseball standings and number is available from the RIOT Baseball Playoff Races . )

Baseball can be a weird business .
As of this moment , the best all - around Minnesota Twin is Drew Butera .
He leads the team in batting average with .360 .
But that 's not all .
During today 's blowout loss , they let him pitch the 8th inning , which he managed to get through without allowing a run .
So he also has the team 's lowest ERA at 0.00 .
And the second best Twin ?
Pitcher Scott Diamond has a 1.40 ERA , which trails only Butera .
But he also had a hit during his three plate appearances courtesy of interleague play .
His .333 batting average , again , trails only Butera .
Last season , position player Michael Cuddyer also pitched a scoreless inning , giving him a 0.00 ERA for the 2011 season .

So , the Yankees , the team I hate the most , is out of it .
And so are the Rays , the AL team I like second best , after my beloved , yet awful , Minnesota Twins .
So , for whom do I root now ?
In the AL , we have the Tigers vs. the Rangers .
One factor is always which team features more former Twins .
The Tigers win easily here , since they now have Delmon Young .
The trade to the Tigers evidentially triggered something that makes him hit more consistently .
Well , good for him .
On the other hand , I 've had a long hatred of the Tigers stemming from the 1987 playoffs , before which Sparky said something shitty about the Twins .
It was something about the Twins not deserving to be in the playoffs .
And then the Twins kicked their collective asses and went on to win the World Series .
On the Rangers ' side , we have a complete lack of former Twins .
Plus , we have a team once partially owned by George W. Bush .
Double plus , they once paid A . Rod more than the entire Twins roster made at the time .
( No , that 's not an exaggeration .
His yearly salary was actually more than the Twins ' entire player payroll . )
I guess I 'm willing to forgive the Tigers for Sparky talking out his ass .
Plus , the fewer games we have to see Dubya sitting in the stands , the better .
On the NL side , things are tougher to decide .
I 've never really seen the Brewers as rivals to the Twins , despite attempts to portray their interleague play as such .
Nor do I hold any ill will towards the Cards from 1987 .
After all , we beat them , too .
And they were n't dicks about it .
So , let 's look at former Twins .
The Cards have Nick Punto , a favorite player of ours , despite his lack of hitting ability .
I 'm , frankly , a bigger fan of good defense than I am of good hitting .
And Nicky has one hell of a glove .
To counter him , the Brewers have Go Go Gomez .
And I love watching him play with reckless abandon and unbridled enthusiasm .
Dang , it 's hard to choose .
So , let 's drop down to former Twin pitchers .
The Cards have Kyle Loshe , who was a bit of a cry-baby with the Twins .
I never really liked him , but he 's done well since leaving .
I was stumped regarding the Brewers , until I remembered that they have LaTroy Hawkins .
Holy crap !
He 's still playing ?
Yes .
Yes he is .
Again , he was a bit of a complainer while a Twin and I never warmed to him , either .
Crap !
Still a tie .
Okay , I 'll lean towards the Brewers , solely because Prince Fielder reminds me of Kent Hrbek .
It 's not just that both were / are chunky , power - hitting first basemen .
It 's because Fielder raises the same question that Hrbek always did .
The question ?
If either of them had gotten in good shape , would that have improved their abilities to a much higher level ?
Or would it have just ruined their considerable natural ability ?
It 's kind of like having a kid who just has a knack for playing the piano .
You want to encourage that .
But will making her take lessons enhance that gift , or potentially ruin it ?
So , there we go !
I 'm rooting for the Tigers and the Brewers !
Who will I take in the World Series ?
Beats me .
That 'll be another blog post .
Frankly , I 'm just happy the Yankees got kicked out in the first round !

We 're well into Spring Training and the mighty Minnesota Twins currently have an 11 - 9 record .
And that is damn near perfect !
What ?
Being a game over .500 is near - perfection ?
Yes it is .
I have a theory about Spring Training .
I think you want your team to have a Spring Training record right around .500 because that 's what you get when you 're trying out new players .
Teams with really good Spring Training records do well in Spring Training because they lack enough new kids to fill out their roster .
They 're playing their regulars in a greater ratio than teams with better farm systems .
So they 're cleaning up in Spring Training against all the other teams ' farm - system - laden rosters .
And the teams that do poorly in Spring Training ?
They 're just stuck with minor league rosters who can't even compete against the farm - system - laden - but - not - dominated rosters .
An optimum ratio of regulars to kids results in a .500 performance in Spring Training .
Doing better ?
That 's because you do n't have enough kids .
Doing worse ?
That 's because you do n't have enough regulars .
So basically , by my theory , if you 're in the top third of the standings in Spring Training , you 'll be in the middle third during the season .
If you 're in the middle third in Spring Training , you 'll be in the top third during the season .
And if you suck in Spring Training , you 'll suck all year .
( Of course , the Royals are 14 - 6 and are basically all new kids .
Hey , it 's the half - assed guess sort of theory , not a scientific theory . )

My analysis of the the Phillies ' acquisition of Cliff Lee is as follows :
Bwaa - ha - ha !
Suck it , Yankees !
And I 'm not even tangentially a Phillies fan .

Battling for the lead in this year 's All - Star voting are the Twins ' Justin Morneau and the Yankees ' Mark Teixeira .
As you could probably guess , the hordes of uninformed Yankee fans are putting Teixeira on top .
Just how stupid is this ?
Take a gander at their respective offensive stats :
Category Justin Morneau Mark Teixeira Average .377 .216 Slugging .685 .378 OBP .493 .326 HR 11 7
Yeah , that 's pretty fucking stupid .
Defensively , it 's a wash .
Neither has yet to commit an error .
Why is this even close ?
Because the Yankees are bad for baseball .

I 'm so sick of ESPN guys gushing about security tasering that kid at the Phillies game .
Look , assholes , tasers are alternatives to deadly force only .
If you could n't shoot 'em , you should n't be tasering 'em .
End of story .
And then there 's all this whining about how we do n't know what he was going to do .
Look , it 's pretty fucking simple .
If they run at a player , then worry .
If they 're just running around like a fucking loon , do n't shit yourselves over it .
And , if you watch the video , this kid was running around like a loon .
One of the ESPN assholes said he deserves whatever he gets .
Like , can we fuck him in the ass with a baseball bat , scar up his face with spikes , then decapitate him ?
Would he deserve that ?
For simple trespass ?
You fucking ESPN pretty - boy idiot .
And then they all mention Monica Seles getting stabbed in 1993 and the father / son duo running on - field at a Cubs game and attacking a guy in 2002 .
Yeah , that 's two incidents over how many years and how many pro sports games ?
( Respectively : 17 and a shitload . )
Since the Cubs incident , there have been over 38 thousand regular season MLB games .
Should we , based on that , always assume that any dweeb running onto the field is a deadly threat .
Ummm , that would be fucking lunacy .
Stupid fucking jocks .
Best thing that ever happened to me as a child was hurting my knee and switching from football to speech and debate .
Even the PTI guys blew this one .
Although at least they were n't as gleeful .
My cousin Brian added Tasering should n't be an option just because your fat doughnut - eating self can't catch the kid .
And he 's exactly correct .
A taser is a non-lethal alternative to a gun .
It 's not a convenience tool .
Plus , if I was going to take out a player , I 'd drop in front of the dugout and take 'em all out at once while they 're sitting down .
Or pop one off while he 's signing an autograph for me .
Or follow him home .
I certainly would n't run around the outfield waving my arms like a loon .
And the thing is , if this kid had pre-planned harm , then he would have done it differently , too .
And if he meant harm , but it was a spur of the moment bit of rage , then the taser was n't going to be a disincentive anyway .
But it 's more than just another overly - zealous use of a taser .
The reaction is so typical of America today .
When did we become such a nation of bed - wetters where we cheer tasering some kid who ran on the field ?
Oh yeah , 9/11 .
And , as a result , today everyone freaks out too damn easily .
Oh noes !
We do n't know what he was going to do !
Well , yes , we do know .
In all likelihood , he was going to run around like a loon .
Stupid , yes .
Harmless , nearly certainly so .
But we can't leave it at that .
Oh no , not in today 's America .
Today , we all piss our pants in terror and cheer when security uses a taser .
Stupid fucking ESPN jocks and stupid fucking cowardly over - reacting America .

In an interview with Mediabistro posted today , Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales had a lot to say about his businesses , Wikipedia and Wikia , their future , and the future of media and the Internet .
Also : he ’s a LOST and FlashForward fan .
The interview is interesting and well worth a read , but this exchange towards the end got our attention :
Mediabistro :
There ’s a restaurant in China that has a dish called “ stir - fried wikipedia with pimentos . ”
Why did they call it “ wikipedia ” ?
Wales :
There ’s a whole weird meme about this .
People keep sending me photos of menus in China with all kinds of different dishes being translated as “ Wikipedia ” .
The best we can figure is that someone is asked to translate the menu into English .
They ask , “ What ’s the name of this dish in English ? ”
And someone says , “ I do n’t know , look it up in Wikipedia ! ”
And they just write down : “ Wikipedia ” .
But honestly , I have no idea !
A funny , satisfactory origin story :
But what , exactly , are “ fried wikipedia with pimentos ” and these other Wikipedia - infused dishes ?
Fortunately , it ’s the Internet , “ pics or it did n’t happen ” is the governing rule , and there are indeed pics :
1. Stir - fried wikipedia with pimientos ( via Evolving Web )
According to Jim Benson , the blogger who spotted and thankfully snapped the Wikipedia - containing menu in question , he tried this at a restaurant in Beijing and it was “ delicious . ”
2. Steam eggs with Wikipedia ( also via Evolving Web )
Sadly , no picture of the dish itself .
3. Barbecued congo eel with wikipedia and Fermented bean curd ( via goodape ’s Flickr )
According to the photographer : “ Congo Eel is actually like a large salamander ( although they probably mean conger eel , which is an eel ) . ”
4. “ Wekipedia ” bread ( via sexybeijing .tv )
If you know of any more tasty Wikipedia foods ( wikifoods ? ) , link ’em in the comments section .
Have a tip we should know ?

At last , multitasking is coming to the iPhone 3GS , iPod Touch ( 3rd Gen ) and iPad , allowing you to quickly switch between applications , using one while others keep doing other tasks in the background .
This is how it works .
Advertisement
How Does It Work ?
For the user , multitasking seems to work transparently and very quickly .
According to Apple , you will be able to switch between applications instantly , while the application running on the foreground — taking over the screen — wo n't suffer slowdowns .
Advertisement
Using their method you will be able to answer an incoming SMS , or chat with a friend , or answer a call , and then go back to keep playing a game , just where you left it before switching to any of those tasks .
Or you will be able to upload photos to Flickr but without having to keep the Flickr app open , like you have to do now .
In this case , the Flickr application will keep uploading those photos while you go read your email or check the weather .
The user interface to manage all the running apps is quite simple : Double - clicking the home button will open a tray showing all running applications .
Switching to another running app is as simple as clicking on it .
It works like the task switch bar in Windows or Mac OS X .

Real - Life Examples
Here 's one example :
In previous versions of the iPhone OS , if you are working on email and there 's a link to a web page , clicking on that link will open Safari and close Mail .
Then , once you were done watching that web page , you close Safari , get back to the main iPhone menu , click on the Mail icon , and go back to your mail .
Advertisement
With iPhone OS 4 , Mail will keep running while Safari opens .
To go back to Mail , the user just needs to double - click the home button : A dock will then slide in from the bottom of the page , showing the running apps .
The Mail icon will be there , and clicking on it will instantly get back to where you left it .
Another good example is Skype :
In previous versions , Skype needs to be open to receive calls .
That makes it useless as a phone replacement .
In iPhone OS 4 , Skype can keep running in the background to receive calls .
It does n't matter you are surfing the web or playing a game :
You will be able to pick up the call — switching instantly to Skype — have a conversation for as long as you want , and then return to your browser or game just where you left it .
Advertisement
While running on the background , apps can do a lot more than that .
An application like Pandora , for example , will be able to keep playing music when you are not actively in it .
The music playback will run in the background , just like the iPod component of your iPhone , iPod touch , and iPad does .

Under the Hood
Apple claims their multitasking will save battery life and resources , unlike the competition .
But how ?
Advertisement
The reason is simple :
This is not 100 % true multitasking .
Not in the sense that developers define it :
All system resources are available to all applications , with the system assuming the role of a traffic controller , giving preference to some tasks and less preference to others as needed .
Free - for - all multitasking will consume way too many resources , especially memory .
This will make the system choke , given the limited memory available in these devices .
The CPU would also be taxed , and it would deplete the battery life quicker while slowing down applications running on the foreground .
Advertisement
Apple 's method , however , is quite clever : Basically , it allows you to pause applications — like you can pause them in any UNIX - based operating system , while enabling some special services to allow some types of tasks — like receiving calls or playing music — to run on the background .
There are seven kinds of services , and Apple says these will give the user the kind of multitasking they demand , but without choking the system :
Advertisement
• The first one is obvious : Background audio for apps like Pandora — and hopefully Spotify — is a must for consumers , who demand other music sources beyond iTunes .
It 's good to see that Apple is taking this area into account specifically , just like they allowed services like Netflix on the iPad .
• Voice - over - IP services , for applications like Skype , are also logical , and another thing that consumers demand .
Until now , VoIP applications were limited because they could n't receive calls when they were not active .
The developers can even use custom sounds for notifications .
Advertisement
• Background location works at two levels , allowing location applications to be aware of your whereabouts , even if you do n't have the app open .
Applications like TomTom would run this service in the background , so you can look at other apps while the GPS still tracks where you are .
When it 's time to take a turn in your planned route , TomTom will tell you using the background audio service .
All without having to leave whatever software you are running in the foreground .
It works similarly with other non-GPS apps that need location services in a less active way than a driving app like TomTom .
Those apps can use 3G cell - tower triangulation to know exactly where you are , alerting you of friends proximity or things happening around you .
Advertisement
• Push notification was a background task already , but it has been expanded .
The iPhone now also supports local notifications .
These notifications are generated by the iPhone apps :
If a cooking app has a timer , for example , it will be able to alert you when your roasted chicken is done .
• Task completion will allow applications to finish any tasks started before switching to another application .
If you are sending or receiving a file in one app , you would be able to switch to another app , and that file will keep downloading .
Advertisement
• Fast app switching will make all running apps instantly available .
Rather than having to start them up each time , like now , the apps in iPhone OS 4.0 will be able to sleep , ready to be awaken at the click of an icon in the running apps tray .
Basically , what Apple has done is to solve all the complaining from users who wanted to do several things at the same time .
While this is not 100 % multitasking , in the traditional desktop sense , it 's a good thing .
Consumers wo n't care about full multitasking if it really works like this .
It 's all a matter of perception and being able to do what you want to do , as fast as possible , while keeping the sense of speed and a long battery life .

With that in mind , this approach seems exactly what the iPhone , the iPod touch , and the iPad needs .

The man who filmed a video that appeared to depict gunshots being fired in the immediate aftermath of the Polish plane crash has apparently been stabbed to death in what many are claiming was a deliberate assassination to silence the individual from making public whatever it was he saw .
The following translation appears on numerous websites , with this Polish website being the original source .

tego filmu Adrij Mendierej , któremu wbito noż w
okolicach Kijowa 15 Kw.2010 roku został
przewieżony w tragicznym stanie do szpitala w
Kijowie , gdzie 16 kwietnia dwóch nieznanych ludzi
odł ączyło mu respirator .

3 razy nóż .
Andrij zmarł po południu o15.03 czasu
Moskiewskiego 16 kwietnia 2010 roku .
Ale
oczywiście jest to przypadek wg ROSYJSKIEGO RZĄDU
The translation is roughly as follows .
“ Author of the video seen by everyone by now has been stabbed near Kijow on 4.15 and transported in critical condition to the hospital in Kijow .
On 4.16 three unidentified individuals unplugged him from life support system and stabbed him 3 more times .
Andrij was prenounced dead that afternoon .
Russian government claims it was a coincidence . ”
The video , which can be viewed below , as well as the apparent fate of the man who shot the footage , have not been reported on by any mainstream news outlet , and the story cannot be completely verified , although the footage in the clip is very similar to images and video seen after the crash .
However , some people are of the belief that the entire story is a hoax , and is being used to falsely implicate Russia in the crash of the aircraft .
Until any confirmation is forthcoming , its authenticity is still up in the air .

Pakilan seurakunnan jäsen , Nina Mustonen , käy kirkossa harva se pyhä .
Perheeseen kuuluu miehen lisäksi kolme lasta ja koira .
Touhua riittää , uskonnon Nina laskee myös arkisiin asioihin kuuluvaksi .
- Kirkossa käyminen tuo juuria ja jatkuvuutta elämään .
Uskon , että on joku korkeampi voima , en niinkään pohdi , sanotaanko Raamatussa niin tai näin .
Uskosta Nina ei halua puhua .
Hän rukoilee , mutta sitä hän pitää yksityisenä keskusteluna , eikä halua kertoa siitä sen enempää .
Kirkossakin hän mielellään hakeutuu vakiopaikalleen rivien päähän etupenkistä .
Uskovaisen rooli tuntuu ahdistavalta .
- Uskovaisesta tulee mieleen , että pitäisi olla hame päällä ja juoda teetä .
Kun uskovainen tulee kotiin kostean illan jälkeen , hän ajattelee , että näkikö naapuri tai miten ympäristö leimaa .
Ehkä uskovaisuudessa on jotain niin suurta , että se hämmentää .
Nina on töissä lähikaupassa .

Senior staffers at the Securities and Exchange Commission spent hours surfing pornographic websites on government - issued computers while they were being paid to police the financial system , an agency watchdog says .
The SEC ’s inspector general conducted 33 probes of employees looking at explicit images in the past five years , according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press .
ADVERTISEMENT
The memo says 31 of those probes occurred in the 2 1/ 2 years since the financial system teetered and nearly crashed .
The staffers ’ behavior violated government - wide ethics rules , it says .
It was written by SEC Inspector General David Kotz in response to a request from Sen. Charles Grassley , R - Iowa .
The memo was first reported Thursday evening by ABC News .
It summarizes past inspector general probes and reports some shocking findings :
_ A senior attorney at the SEC’s Washington headquarters spent up to eight hours a day looking at and downloading pornography .
When he ran out of hard drive space , he burned the files to CDs or DVDs , which he kept in boxes around his office .
He agreed to resign , an earlier watchdog report said .

_ An accountant was blocked more than 16,000 times in a month from visiting websites classified as “ Sex ” or “ Pornography . ”
Yet he still managed to amass a collection of “ very graphic ” material on his hard drive by using Google images to bypass the SEC ’s internal filter , according to an earlier report from the inspector general .
The accountant refused to testify in his defense , and received a 14 - day suspension .
_ Seventeen of the employees were “ at a senior level , ” earning salaries of up to $ 222,418 .
_ The number of cases jumped from two in 2007 to 16 in 2008 .
The cracks in the financial system emerged in mid-2007 and spread into full - blown panic by the fall of 2008 .

California Rep. Darrell Issa , the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , said it was “ disturbing that high - ranking officials within the SEC were spending more time looking at porn than taking action to help stave off the events that put our nation ’s economy on the brink of collapse . ”
He said in a statement that SEC officials “ were preoccupied with other distractions ” when they should have been overseeing the growing problems in the financial system .

An SEC spokesman declined to comment Thursday night .
About 16 percent of men with Internet access at work admit to looking at online porn while at the office , according to a 2006 survey by Websense Inc .
Former SEC spokesman Michael Robinson said he shares the public ’s outrage about SEC staffers who enjoyed porn on the taxpayer dime when they were supposed to be keeping the markets safe .

“ That kind of behavior is just intolerable and atrocious , ” said Robinson , now with Levick Strategic Communications .
He said he expects SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro and her team are “ very focused on ” the issue .
Schapiro has had other worries in recent days .
She has been parrying Republican attacks after announcing civil fraud charges Friday against Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs Group Inc .
Agency officials had hoped the charges would mark a new era of tougher oversight of Wall Street .
They followed high - profile embarrassments including the failure to catch Ponzi kings Bernard Madoff and R. Allen Stanford .
But soon after Goldman charges were filed , Republicans began questioning the timing of the announcement .
The news came as the Senate prepared to take up a sweeping overhaul of the rules governing banks and other financial companies .

Republican lawmakers also accused the SEC of being influenced by politics .
The SEC ’s commissioners approved the Goldman charges on a rare 3 - 2 vote .
The two who objected were Republicans .
Schapiro is a registered independent who has been appointed by presidents of both parties .

We got our figures wrong on the CO2 emissions of Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajoekull .
Badly wrong .
So we want to apologise .
We pride ourselves on good data and solid information .
Despite detailed research and feedback from Icelandic vulcanologists , our figures were out by a magnitude of ten .
The volcano is emitting 150,000 tons of CO2 per day , not 15,000 tons .

The post was always intended as an open question .
Our hope was to get the information refined and corrected .
Naively , we did n’t expect the graphic to go super-viral .
We ’re sorry for any confusion , annoyance and distrust this error may have caused .
We ’ll do better next time .

How big is the bill , really ?
We should start by putting the health - care bill into proper perspective .
Opponents and supports of the bill have both profited immensely from exploiting the average person 's inability to put billions and trillions into context .
So let 's begin by breaking down the numbers .
The $ 900 billion price tag is repeated with the regularity of a rooster 's crow .
That 's a shame , as the number is , somewhat impressively , misleading in both directions .
On the one hand , that $ 900 billion -- or , more precisely , $ 940 billion in the final legislation -- is stretched over 10 years .
But people do n't think in 10 - year increments .
They do n't pay taxes once a decade .
Put more simply , the bill will cost an average of $ 94 billion a year over the first 10 years .
But that 's not quite right either :
The bill would n't really kick in until 2014 .
To get a more accurate annual figure , look at a year in which the bill is fully operational .
In , say , 2016 , the bill 's spending will be about $ 160 billion ( you can find these numbers on page 22 of the CBO report ) .
According to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services , total health - care spending that year will be about $ 3.7 trillion .
In other words , the bill 's spending is equivalent to about 4 percent of what we 'll spend in health care in a year , and it will be covering 30 million people .
So that 's really what we 're talking about here -- a large health - care expansion that 's a slight fraction of overall spending .
The graph on the right tells the tale ( though the $ 175 billion refers to the Senate bill ; the reconciliation fixes increase the 2018 spending to about $ 200 billion , which is no different for the purposes of the image ) .
Let 's go even further :
It 's an expansion that most people wo n't notice in 10 years .
According to the Congressional Budget Office , the Senate bill will change the insurance of about 40 million people by 2019 , about 30 million of whom would have been otherwise uninsured .
The other 10 million will come from the employer or individual markets in search of more affordable options .
About 23 million people will still be uninsured , many of them illegal immigrants .
About 90 percent of Americans will be exactly where they'd be if this reform had never passed .
That accounts for the spending side of the bill .
What about the cost control ?
It 's the same story , but more so .
Although the bill solves most of the coverage problem , it accounts for a mere fraction of the cost problem .
A report by the centrist policy group Third Way estimated that the Senate legislation would save more than $ 800 billion over the next 15 years .
That 's consistent with the CBO 's expectation that the Senate legislation and the reconciliation fixes would save more than a trillion dollars over the next 20 years .
That 's a big number .
Quite a bit more than my car cost , and I thought my car cost a lot of money .
But the savings amounts to no more than a rounding error given the tens of trillions of dollars we 're going to spend over that period .
It 's half of 1 percent of expected GDP .
Importantly , though , it 's a rounding error in the right direction .
The bill is thick with efforts to move toward cost control , if not efforts to actually impose cost controls .
The excise tax , the Medicare Commission , the pilot programs to change how hospitals are paid and most of the other proposals are designed to bear fruit in the future .
The excise tax -- which slaps a fee on high - cost plans in order to give a competitive advantage to those that hold costs down more effectively -- initially applies to very few plans but would hit more as premium costs rise .
The payment reforms have to pay off as pilot programs before being considered for Medicare - wide -- much less systemwide -- use .
I 'll talk about all these in greater detail later today .
But the key when thinking about them is to recognize that the name of the game is n't impressive - sounding cuts .
As we 've already seen , such cuts are actually not that impressive when put into context .
Instead , the key is changes to the growth rate in health - care spending -- even small ones .
The problem with health - care spending is not that we spent $ 2.3 trillion in 2008 .
It 's that that number has been growing by 7 percent annually .
It 's the rate of increase , and not the level of spending , that we need to change .
Consider again the $ 2.3 trillion we spent in 2008 .
Given the current rate of growth , in 2028 , we 'll spend $ 8.9 trillion on health care .
Imagine , however , that we got really serious about cost control and cut $ 200 billion next year .
If costs were to grow at the same rate , we 'd still be spending $ 8.1 trillion in 20 years .
Imagine , then , that we did n't cut a dollar -- but got cost growth down to 5 percent ( which is still faster than wage or GDP growth ) .
In that case , that $ 2.3 trillion would only be $ 6.1 trillion in 2028 -- and we'd have saved money every year leading up to that .
That 's actually manageable .
But changing the growth of the health - care system is a lot harder than just cutting a few dollars here or there .
It requires us to change how doctors practice medicine , or how much medicine people buy or how much they need -- or maybe all three .
We 're doing a lot on health - care reform this year , but we 're not doing that much .
And we should n't fool ourselves into thinking otherwise .
We 'll be back at this again , and soon .

The United Football League has been actively trying to convince the NFL to invest in the junior league in hopes of gaining a valuable senior partner , as well as other investors , according to sources .
However , the latest proposal -- which would give the NFL a 30 percent stake in the year - old UFL -- is not on the agenda for discussion during the NFL owners ' meetings , which run Sunday through Wednesday in Orlando , Fla .
Such a potential move was interpreted by one source as the NFL acquiring another pawn in the chess match between the owners and the NFL Players Association when the current labor agreement expires after the 2010 season .
An owners source refuted that notion , saying any financial investment in the UFL would be counter - productive to the NFL 's collective - bargaining position that the league has significant economic challenges .
The UFL has proposed that in addition to the 30 percent investment , of which the specific dollar amount was not revealed by sources , the NFL will have at least one seat on the UFL 's board and a role in the football operations .
Sources disagree on whether a deal is likely .
The potential partnership was first reported as a " rumor " by ProFootballTalk.com in February that the NFL had offered $ 50 million for a 51 percent share of the UFL , which countered by offering 49 percent for $ 49 million .
At that time , an NFL spokesman said the specifics of that rumor " were flat - out wrong " and that no offer had been made by the NFL .
On the latest information , NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said , " We decline to comment . "
A UFL official also declined comment .
One source said the two sides had signed a non-disclosure agreement .
The UFL is hopeful that a potential partnership with the NFL will bolster its ongoing efforts to add investors as it attempts to expand from four to six teams this year .
Currently , the UFL has teams based in Las Vegas , Sacramento , Hartford , Conn. , and Orlando .
On the role of the NFL in UFL operations , a source said the UFL would agree to more uniformity in player contracts with the NFL , initially setting terms at two years for each UFL player .
If an NFL franchise signed a UFL player who is under contract , there have been discussions about the NFL team paying a rights fee to the UFL team that loses the player , the source said .
In 2009 , during a six - game regular season , the UFL released players to sign with any NFL team after the championship game in late November .
Some NFL personnel executives were frustrated they were unable to sign or work out UFL players once the upstart league 's 2009 season was in progress .
The proposed partnership also potentially would provide additional programming for the league - owned NFL Network , which would broadcast some UFL games , sources said .
If there ever was a partnership , the NFL would likely use the UFL as a training ground for on - field game officials and possibly experiment with a variety of competitive concepts , a source added , such as it did with NFL Europe , which shut down operations in 2007 .
NFL players ' union officials , who were still in Maui wrapping up their business meetings , did not have immediate comment , but one suggested any NFL partnership with the UFL would be setting the stage to monopolize the 2011 season when an NFL lockout has been projected .
A league source reiterated that the proposals being discussed have been generated by the UFL and have not been warmly embraced yet .
The UFL has its league meeting , also in Orlando , April 21 - 23 .
The NFL also has another owners ' meeting in Dallas in May .

A new book titled Do fish feel pain ?
by the renowned scientist , Victoria Braithwaite , is a very important read for those interested in the general topic of pain in animals , especially because it has been long assumed that fishes are not sentient beings and are not all that intelligent .
A few years ago I reviewed the literature about sentience in fishes and other animals who live beneath the surface ( see also ) and it's clear that a strong case can be made for protecting fish and other aquatic animals from harm .
Professor Braithwaite 's book contains an incredible amount of recent scientific data that support this idea .
Many people will likely not take or have the time to read her book , so let me tell you what she says at the beginning of her chapter titled " Looking to the future . "
She writes : " I have argued that there is as much evidence that fish feel pain and suffer as there is for birds and mammals -- and more than there is for human neonates and preterm babies . " ( page 153 ) .
Professor Braithwaite then goes on to note that these data will require us to change the ways in which we interact with fishes because we now know that they suffer and feel pain .
Catch - and - release programs surely need to be curtailed because even if fishes survive their encounter with a hook they do suffer and die from the of being caught , fighting to get the hook out of their mouth or other body areas , and the wounds they endure ( for a study on catch and release methods and mortality in fishes see ) .
Even hunters agree that catch - and - release are unethical and that torturing a fish at the end of a hook is just wrong .
It would be singularly unethical not to increase protection for fishes and other animals who we previously thought were n't sentient .
Teaching our children that ever popular catch - and - release programs are inhumane is a good way to go for making the future for fish and other animals a more humane and pleasant experience .

A message from the T - Rex : Charmer lead guitarist Pat Tenneriello !
I have n't heard this song in over 27 years and then one day I went looking for it on YouTube to show my little nephew .
Once on YouTube , your website came up and here I am .
Charmer was a four piece pop rock band based out of Chicago , IL .
We were actively playing the Chicago club circuit from 1985 - 1989 .
Our manager at the time had very good connections around the Chicago land area .
While recording our first album , one of his connections happened to be at the recording studio one day and heard our energetic pop rock sound .
He told us about a kid Dinosaur movie that was in production starring Fred Savage and the producers were at the time actively looking for a song that would feature Dinosaur cartoon characters singing along to the song .
Needless to say , we were on board with the entire thing .
The lyrics were already written by the person who wrote the screenplay while the music along with the song 's arrangement was left up to us .
We went into the studio on a weekend and wrote , arranged , and recorded the entire music track along with all the vocals .
Due to the contractual agreement , we sadly had to relinquish all rights and therefore any ownership of the song .
I honestly thought Mesozoic Mind had been long forgotten .
But according to this website , the song has had a long lasting impact on many young and adult lives and I 'm proud and honored to have been a part of it .
As a songwriter / musician , you always hope that your music can somehow capture the hearts and minds of your listeners .
As a result of finding your website and reading all the wonderful stories and memories , I can truly say that one song did .
Many grateful thanks !
We never did get to meet Fred Savage .
Oh Well !

NASA Shuttle program manager John Shannon said on Tuesday ( Mar 9 ) that the Space Shuttle Program can indeed be safely extended beyond the existing plan to retire the fleet after completing the four missions currently remaining to fly by the end of 2010 .
The key issue now is money not safety .
“ Where the money comes from is the ‘ big question ’ .
We feel like we ’ve addressed [ the issue of shuttle ] recertification ” , said Shannon at a press briefing at the Johnson Space Center in Houston .
More missions could be flown if money was available .
But there could be up to a two year gap in flights due to the need to restart the production lines for the huge External Tank ( ET ) which have already been shut down .
NASA has only five ET ’s remaining in inventory to fly out the current manifest of four , plus 1 more flight if approved by the Obama Administration , ( read my earlier article ) .
The purpose of any additional shuttle missions is quite clear .
They would be directed to resupply the International Space Station ( ISS ) who ’s working orbital lifetime has just been extended by five years to 2020 from 2015 .
However , the ISS cannot operate and conduct the scientific research for which it was constructed without a steady and robust stream of rocket launches to loft new human crews and cargo resupply flights .
“ The real issue the agency and the nation has to address is the expense , ” said Shannon .
“ The shuttle program is fairly expensive .
We burn at about a $ 200 million a month rate .
So that gives you a base of about $ 2.4 billion a year that it would require to continue flying the shuttle , almost irregardless of how many flights you flew during the year .
There ’s just a base cost there you have to pay to keep the program in business ” , explained Shannon .
Shannon ’s comments are completely in line with those spoken by NASA KSC Shuttle manager Mike Moses about two weeks ago at the STS 130 post landing briefing .
The vast expense which would supposedly be required to recertify the three orbiter shuttle fleet to fly beyond 2010 has frequently been cited by many shuttle detractors to justify a shuttle shutdown .
Shannon and Moses now state that NASA has in effect already recertified the shuttle fleet as part of the requirements set by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board ( CAIB ) for the Return to Flight in 2005 following the Columbia tragedy during re-entry in February 2003 .
“ From a personal standpoint , I just think it ’s amazing that we ’re headed down a path where we ’re not going to have any vehicles at all to launch from the Kennedy Space Center for an extended period of time .
To give up all the lessons learned , the blood , sweat and tears we ’ve extended to get the space shuttle to the point where it is right now , where it ’s performing so magnificently ” , said Shannon .
President Obama ’s highly controversial recent decision to completely cancel Project Constellation ( comprising the Orion capsule and Ares 1 and Ares V booster rockets ) leaves the US with no near term human spaceflight program to replace the shuttle before its looming retirement and no vehicle to send astronauts to the ISS and beyond to the Moon and Mars as directed by President Bush in 2004 .
There are no specific destinations , goals or timelines outlined in Obama ’s strategy and no direction to develop a new heavy lift booster to replace the cancelled Ares V .
In its place would be some funding for technology development as outlined by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden at a KSC news briefing I attended .
Bolden stated that NASA would not build a Heavy Lift booster “ until the 2020 to 2030 time fame ” .
The US would be left completely dependent on the Russians and their Soyuz capsule to send American astronauts into space for many years to come .
Russia recently increased the price for Soyuz seats to $ 50 million and further increases are expected after the shuttle is retired .
Meanwhile , China is pushing full steam ahead developing a new heavy lift booster – the Long March 5 and is constructing new manned Shenzhou capsules and even the first element of a space station .
China puts its scientists and engineers to work generating innovations on exciting new space projects , while the US voluntarily dismantles its space exploration capabilities , lays off tens of thousands of people – potentially devastating local economies – and loses their accumulated knowledge .
President Obama has directed that NASA should cancel development of the manned Orion capsule and instead fund alternative private companies to develop new space taxis to deliver astronauts to low Earth orbit , or LEO .
Critics have questioned the timelines of when the commercial companies can actually produce a manned capsule and whether the safety of astronauts will be compromised by companies seeking profits .
$ 9 Billion has already been spent on Project Constellation and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden says it will cost an additional $ 2.5 to cancel the ongoing contracts .
At least 9000 jobs will be rapidly lost at the Kennedy Space Center due to the simultaneous shutdown of the Shuttle and Constellation human spaceflight programs .
Tens of thousands more jobs will be lost across the country , especially in Florida , Texas , Louisiana , Alabama and California .
Layoffs have already begun .
There has been harsh bipartisan criticism of Obama ’s new plan for NASA from some key members of Congress in the Senate and House who cite the new plan as nothing more than a gigantic “ job killer ” which will also kill Americas 50 year long leadership in Space and terminate manufacturing facilities and infrastructure as well as the accumulated know - how .
Many in academia and industry also fear greatly for the future job prospects of students in science & technology , engineering and aerospace .
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson ( R - Texas ) has introduced a new bill to extend the life of the shuttle program until a replacement rocket system is available .
Representatives Suzanne Kosmas ( D ) and Bill Posey ( R ) of Florida introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives – which was co-sponsored by other Democrats and Republicans from several states – to extend the shuttle , minimize the human spaceflight gap and accelerate development of a next generation space vehicle .
“ Right now we estimate that gap would be about two years from when we ’re told [ to restart production ] to when we ’d have the first external tank rolling off the assembly line ” , explained Shannon .
The gap could be shortened by delaying one or more of the remaining flights .
Shannon said that in response to the Congressional bills , “ We kicked off an extension study for each of the program elements to go out and physically touch base with each of the vendors and the sub vendors and the entire supply chain and understand where we might have some issues if we were to restart the program .
“ There is this big misconception that there ’s all this big supply chain that was shuttle specific only .
Shuttle is for the most part a sideline business for these major companies that support the actual program .
We will send that information to NASA Headquarters . ”
“ We ’ve addressed the orbiter recertification issues .
We are addressing the supply line issues .
I do n’t expect to find any problems there .
The real issue we would have is just in manufacturing .
While you have a supply chain , while you can get a workforce back to go and build things like external tanks , there would be some type of a gap ” , he added .
Basically , an extension depends on whether the money is available .
President Obama decided that he would not fund a shuttle extension and also decided to terminate Project Constellation in the new NASA budget .
The White House has just announced plans for a Florida space summit on April 15 to be held at or near the Kennedy Space Center where President Obama will discuss his new strategy for NASA .
He may also announce approval for one more shuttle mission using the final ET being held in reserve in case of a space emergency rescue mission for the currently planned final mission in September 2010 .
Based on the very hostile reaction and comments from Congress and local residents and politicians in Florida at a number of recent forums , President Obama should not anticipate to be greeted by a friendly crowd unless he unexpectedly announces a major policy change .

Meeting Students Where They Are Pages 42 - 45
When Students Do n't Play the Game
Jessica Towbin
In September 2008 , I began teaching at Health Sciences and Human Services High School ( HS3 ) , one of three new autonomous themed schools on the campus of what had been a large comprehensive high school .
I had been searching for a small school where I could pursue my passion for reform , and here was an opportunity to be part of establishing a school 's identity , structures , and practices .
I knew that my new school , where about 70 percent of the 350 students were eligible for free and reduced - price lunch , would also offer me new challenges in the classroom .
But as an experienced , accomplished teacher , I believed that I was ready to take on those challenges .
Start where the kids are was a mantra in my teacher certification program .
This imperative served my students and me well for the first 13 years of my career , when I taught in diverse but predominantly middle - class , suburban schools .
But last year , after transferring to an urban school just south of Seattle , Washington , I gained a new and deeper understanding of what it means to start where the kids are — and why it 's essential for effective teaching and learning .
When I met my students at the beginning of the school year , I was prepared to meet them where they were .
I expected this would mean addressing large skill deficits .
I quickly discovered , however , that most of the students did not have skill deficits ; what they had was a level of disengagement and even anger toward school that I had never before encountered on such a wide scale .
When I taught in predominantly middle - or upper - class suburbs , I took for granted a culture of compliance .
Although there were always a few disengaged , disobedient kids , they were the exceptions , the ones who did n't fit the system .
I either tried to make them fit or accommodated them by tinkering around the edges of the system .
Although my colleagues and I talked about differentiated instruction and personalization , it was easy for me not to do those things very deeply as long as students played the game .
When students who did n't have the skills to engage meaningfully in instruction at least made an effort , the most I had to do was provide extra help or slightly modify the assignment .
When even students who did n't go through the motions were at least quiet in their disengagement , I could urge them to get on task and remind them of how failing to do the work would affect their grades .
If those tactics failed , I could call their homes .
Neither the culture of the school nor the culture of the community challenged my assumption that what I was offering would be meaningful to all students .
My current students , on the other hand , do n't play the game of school .
They do not suffer fools gladly and they do not offer strangers the benefit of the doubt .
They broadcast their disengagement through either words or actions .
A typical class : Angie , Shauna , and Sabrina text their friends rather than focusing on the reading .
Ian draws in his composition book .
Nicholas does not even bother to take out his composition book ; he just watches Ian draw .
I call for the students to join me in the meeting area at the front of the class for instruction , but they stay at their desks on the opposite end of the room , as far away from me as possible .
When I do manage to gather them for instruction , Donny interrupts after just a few minutes with , " This is stupid ! " I carry on .
Lexi rolls her eyes and sighs loudly .
Carlos says , " Ca n't we just go back to our desks ?
This is boring . "
Although such classroom behaviors are challenging , they also present an opportunity .
The fact that my students do n't even attempt to hide their lack of interest forces me to face it head on .
If a particular assignment or activity is not meaningful to my students , they wo n't do it .
I do n't mean that they have to think it 's fun .
They want to learn , but they want to learn things that matter and in ways that matter to them .
" I Know What to Do "
Because they have been unsuccessful in school for so long , many of these students do n't think they are smart .
Others do realize they 're smart , but they feel no connection to school .
One of my students , Alexandra , would spend the entire 100 minutes of the class period reading a book .
She could speak and write insightfully about what she read .
When she was n't reading , Alexandra wrote poetry .
She saw no connection , however , between her own reading and writing and what happened in school .
I spent a lot of time thinking about Alexandra and how I could help her to find meaning in her education .
I fought my urge to insist that she " get to work " and instead tried to get to know her .
This approach with Alexandra reflected a shift in my stance as a teacher .
When I first encountered my students ' widespread disengagement and outright hostility toward me and toward learning , my instinct was to try to establish control .
They were challenging my authority , and I went on the defensive , imposing new seating charts , sending students to the office , writing referrals — all responses that provided some breaks from the most distracting and disruptive students but failed to address the underlying issue of their disengagement .
With the support of a literacy coach who offered me new ways to think and talk with students , I was able to shift from a focus on control to a focus on inquiry .
" Starting where the kids are " became an exercise not merely in diagnosing their skills , but also in discovering who they were and what was important to them .
Sometimes that meant hanging back and watching them ; sometimes that meant approaching a group of students who appeared off - task and sincerely asking , " What are you doing ? "
Often , when I take this approach , I learn that students actually are engaged in their learning .
If not , it 's an opportunity for me to learn what is getting in the way .
Sometimes this inquiry stance means sitting with a student and saying , " So , it seems like you 're trying really hard not to do the work in this class .
Why is that ?
Where do you really want to go ? "
Students find this approach disarming .
It 's no longer about them either complying or resisting .
It 's about me trying to understand where they are and meeting them there .
After months of watching Alexandra cling to her identity as a student who did not participate in class and failing to find an entry point with her into what the class was working on ( writing editorials ) , I realized that even with all the choice inherent in the process , the idea of writing an editorial just was not meaningful to her .
I approached her while she was immersed in her latest novel :
" Alexandra , I see that you are not interested in writing an editorial .
I also know that you do a lot of writing .
Is there another form of writing you 'd like to do that would allow you to show the process and skills we 've been working on ? "
After a brief pause she replied , " I could write and publish some book reviews .
I just finished one book , and I 'll be done with this one soon . "
I had vowed years ago never to assign book reviews again because they are so painful to read .
But I had to honor Alexandra 's choice .
" OK .
I have some published reviews you can use as models . "
" I know what to do , " she assured me .
And she went on to describe the elements of an effective book review .
We negotiated a deadline and agreed that she would use her class time for writing the reviews .
She followed through , and in the end her book reviews were some of the most well - crafted pieces of writing I have ever read .
The benefits for Alexandra extended beyond that particular unit .
After the experience of being part of the class in a way that was meaningful to her , during the next unit she joined her classmates in reading and discussing shared texts ; and she has begun to see options for herself .
" That Makes Sense "
Alexandra is not unique among my students in her ability to challenge the status quo of school .
Even the ones who regularly participate push back when I ask them to do something that does n't seem reasonable to them .
One morning I became frustrated with a group of juniors and seniors who were having side conversations during writing instruction .
I sent them out of the room for the duration of my lesson , and then had a heart - to - heart talk with them while the rest of the class worked independently .
I told them that I felt a sense of urgency because we did n't have a lot of time together , and their writing skills were not as far along as they needed to be .
" It matters , " I told them , " even if you 're not going to spend the rest of your life doing literary analysis . "
In my previous schools , at that point the kids would have just said , " OK , we 'll get to work . "
But these kids were more thoughtful that that .
" Why does it matter ? " asked Juan .
He was n't trying to stall or to be disrespectful .
His question was sincere .
Darn it .
Now I had to have a good answer .
I tried : " It matters because it 's about taking something apart and looking at it closely to figure out how it works , and then being able to explain clearly what you figured out .
And that 's a skill you need no matter what you do . "
" That makes sense , " replied Juan .
" It does ? " I was surprised and relieved .
" Yeah . "
" Great .
OK , then .
Are you ready to focus on your learning ? "
" Yes . "
And they were .
Had I simply reprimanded them for disrupting my instruction and directed them to do the assignment , it is unlikely that anything useful would have resulted .
Moreover , it is unlikely that they would have responded positively to this conversation if I had not established credibility with them over the previous four months .
Stepping Back and Listening
When I am effective , I do n't meet students where they are just once at the start of the year , or even just at the start of each new unit .
I meet them where they are every day , and rarely as an entire class .
To engage these students in learning that matters to them , I need to repeatedly ask the question , " Where are you ? " and be prepared to step back and listen .
The rapid adoption of the crops is evidence that American farmers see the technology as beneficial .
Critics of biotechnology , who say the crops may be risky to health and the environment , have issued studies saying that use of the crops has resulted in increased reliance on pesticides and has had only a minimal effect on crop yields .
The National Research Council report , more than 200 pages , was prepared by a committee of mainly academic scientists , and it relied primarily on peer - reviewed papers .
Still , the report is not likely to win over critics of the crops .
One critic , Charles Benbrook , said the conclusion that the crops help farmers might not be true in the future .
That is because the report relies mostly on data from the first few years , before prices of the biotech seeds rose sharply and the glyphosate - resistant weeds proliferated .

“ This is a very different future , ” said Dr. Benbrook , an agricultural economist who is chief scientist at the Organic Center , which promotes organic food and farming .
“ The cost is going to be way higher .
The environmental impacts are going to go up fairly dramatically . ”
As prices of the biotech seeds have risen sharply , even some farmers are now starting to question whether they are worth it .
Just last week , Monsanto , the leading agricultural biotechnology company , said it would lower the prices of its newest genetically engineered soybeans and corn seeds because farmers were not buying as many as it had expected .
The Justice Department is investigating whether Monsanto , which has patents on the Roundup Ready system , is violating antitrust laws , unduly increasing prices or hindering innovation .

April 21 , 2010  --
Jealousy can be so powerful that it can leave a person " functionally blinded , " unable to see key images in their immediate environment .
That 's the core finding of a study by two psychologists at the University of Delaware , who have been running for cover ever since their study was published in the journal Emotion a few days ago .
Steven Most , a cognitive psychologist , and Jean - Philippe Laurenceau , a specialist in social relationships , conducted two experiments involving a total of 52 romantically involved couples on the Newark campus .
They wanted to see if jealousy can be strong enough to cause " emotion - induced blindness . "
Their research shows that women who admitted they were jealous when their guy ogled photos of other women ( presumably female students at the university who were " accessible " ) could n't concentrate on a basic computer task well enough to recognize simple images that flashed quickly across the monitor .
The problem , judging by many reports on the research , is the work showed that women could be blinded by jealousy , but not necessarily men .
Why Women but Not Men ?
It was juicy fodder for the Internet , leading one writer to claim the conclusions proved that " scientists hate women . "
Other comments , which Laurenceau labeled " venomous , " cast doubt upon the scientists ' credentials , intelligence , and intentions .
" We 're definitely not women haters , " Laurenceau said in a telephone interview .
" I 'm married to one , and I have a daughter . "
The study targeted women , Most said , because the sample needed to be homogeneous , and men and women apparently have different attitudes about jealousy .
Previous studies have also focused on women , so this adds to that data , and the researchers are considering doing other experiments targeting men , although it 's not clear if that is going to happen .
In the meantime , the study does show just how vulnerable our perception can be to emotions .
The women who participated in the study really were " blinded " by jealousy , Most said , but not in a literal sense .
Jealousy Scrambles Message to the Brain
" The eyes are fine , " he said , but the message to the brain was scrambled .
The result was " emotion - induced failures of visual perception , " as the title of their study put it .
To conduct the experiments , each couple was tested independently of the other couples .
The romantic partners sat in a room , separated by a curtain , each facing a different computer monitor .
The woman 's task was to watch as images flashed on the screen , visible for only about one - sixteenth of a second .
Most of the views were landscapes , but she was supposed to pick out " target images , " buildings tilted 90 degrees to the left , or 90 degrees to the right .
The fifth slide before each target image was of an emotional subject , something gruesome or disgusting .
Her partner was told initially to evaluate the attractiveness of some landscapes on his monitor .
But about midway through the experiment , the game plan was changed .
Instead of landscapes , the male was told to judge the attractiveness of females as they appeared on his monitor .
So really the only thing that changed was the guy was looking at girls instead of landscapes .
Jealousy Left Women Participants ' Functionally Blind '
Many of the female participants were really uneasy with that change of direction , they later told the experimenters .
And the results showed that the more jealous they became , the more targeted images they missed .
Jealousy , it seems , had left them " functionally blind . "
That happens frequently in our daily lives , Most said , although it 's not always caused by jealousy .
" There 's plenty of examples , especially in auto accidents , where someone is looking right at something , and yet they do n't see it , " he added .
" The eyes are working just fine , but there 's something about the visual system in the brain that has a little hiccup . "
In the experiments , it was more than a hiccup .
Jealousy , Laurenceau said , " is a signal that something is wrong and a relationship might be ending .
It 's a very strong feeling of insecurity , and you are almost primed to look for other potentially threatening information in the environment .
It could be that the disturbing images represented other threats . "
Brain Seems Wired to Prioritize Emotional Information
So the female participant sees a photo of a woman being assaulted , or some other grotesque image , and when the building on its side flashes across her screen five images later , she misses it .
" The brain seems to be wired to prioritize emotional information , " Most said .
" If there 's something that 's inherently emotional right in front of us , our brain says pay attention to this regardless of whether you want to or not , and the consequence is that we do n't see something that comes right afterward . "
Laurenceau acknowledged that the subjects in the study were somewhat vulnerable .
The women averaged about 19 years of age .
All the participants were students at the university .
" For 19 - year - olds a big part of their lives is to have relationships , " he said .
" Last semester I taught a class of freshmen .
The point of the class was to help them transition into college .
And the biggest things they were focusing on were making friends , dating , and getting good grades , in that order .
" So we picked a population where jealousy would be extremely relevant , " Laurenceau said .
Is There a Difference in How Men and Women Handle Jealousy ?
So would the same findings apply to more mature relationships ?
That would likely depend on the security of the relationship , he said .
And is there a difference in how men and women deal with jealousy , and how it affects their visual perception ?
Both researchers said that question is beyond the focus of their studies .
Others , however , have suggested that there are considerable differences between the genders .
Evolutionary psychologists have argued that men tend to get more jealous than women if it has to do with sexual infidelity , and women get more jealous than men if there 's a threat of emotional infidelity .
Regardless of age , and regardless of the type of emotion , and regardless of gender , jealousy and other feelings become particularly powerful in the context of our relationship with others .
It is in social relationships , Most said , that " we experience our strongest emotions . "
And sometimes , according to this research , those emotions can be strong enough to render us temporarily blinded .
Whether male or female .
I ’m too distracted to fall asleep .
Everyone is quietly snoring .
The sun rises ever so slowly and the wings of the plane rudely cut through the calmness of the clouds .
It ’s hard to believe that the intensity of the sun repeats itself with this beauty every day .
That it ’s not for this special day that led me to be on this flight , on my way to Barcelona .
I guess my mind makes it negligible just to maintain every - day continuity .
Ca n’t comprehend all of chaos theory at once .
So how did I get on this flight ?
Around 9 p.m. last night I found out that The Real News got an in - kind donation to send me to Barcelona to cover the Russell Tribunal on Palestine .
By midnight I was packed up and by 2 am I was at the airport .
Someone thought this tribunal was so important and had the kind of faith in my reporting that frankly makes me terrified .
Last month I took international friends to the airport .
When internationals fly alone out of Israel , they get a “ 6 ” or a “ 5 ” .
This number is a sticker you get on your passport and bags that helps the Israeli airport security evaluate your level of Zionism .
“ 1 ” is awesome , “ 6 ” is you ’re fucked .
1 is reserved for white Jewish Israelis , 2 is for white Jewish non-Israelis and friendly internationals , 3 is a suspicious Israeli or international , 4 is sometimes given to non-white Israelis , 5 is for Arab Israelis or questionable internationals , and 6 is for Palestinians , Muslims , and hostile internationals .
Hostile is defined as not Zionist or suspected of questioning Zionism .
Anything above a 3 means interrogation .
Of course these are my definitions based on the people I ’ve talked to who ’ve gotten one of the six .
I do n’t know what the official language they use says .
In most airports they ask you the benign questions of “ did you pack your own bag ? ”
In Israel they try to find out how Zionist you are .
If you ’re an international who ’s been here you ’ve experienced the invasive questions about your love of Israel so you know it ’s always better to bring along an Israeli for protection .
My presence with them meant I answered all the questions for them and the fact that I grew up in a settlement landed them a 2 - the best grade they could get as non citizens .
We rehearsed for hours .
So I enter the line confident and on cloud number nine from excitement .
After all , I ’m going to Barcelona !
To cover the Russell Tribunal !
My Israeli -Palestinian roommate tells me he ’ll wait while I answer the security lady ’s questions .
She sees I speak Hebrew , she asks if I packed my own bags and she gives me a “ 1 ” as expected .
I ’m white and I ’m an Israeli , therefore I ’m probably a Zionist .
High from excitement and privilege I ask if my friend can come with me to the check - in .
She says of course and asks for his ID .
Her face changes .
Where it says the Jewish birthdate the line in his ID is blank .
i.e. not Jewish .
I.e. Palestinian .
–" you know this man ? ”
– “ yes ”
– “ how ? ”
– “ he ’s my roommate ”
– “ where ? ”
– “ Jaffa ” ( a mixed Israeli - Palestinian city )
– “ wait here . ”
She looks at his last name .
It ’s Christian , i.e. Arab .
She disappears with our passports .
The roommate looks at me and we both know what ’s going to happen .
When she comes back her smile is gone .
She tears the “ 1 ” off my bags and angrily puts on a “ 3 ” as though to say “ you did n’t tell me you have an Arab friend ! ”
Her face says “ do n’t you see you ’re fucking it all up for us ? ! ”
She sends me to the “ other ” line where people get their bags carefully checked .
All the black people are in this line , all the Arab - looking people and the non-Zionist internationals .
At least they ’re not pretending their racial profiling is random .
As I wait in line the security manager looks me up and down .
He looks confused .
Everyone else is a person of colour .
So he approaches me .
– “ Where did you come from ? ”
– “ Excuse me ? ”
– “ To the airport , where did you come from ?
Where do you live ? ”
– “ Tel Aviv – Jaffa ”
– “ And where did you grow up ?
When did you come to Israel ? ”
– “ I grew up in Ariel [ a West Bank settlement ] , I came to Israel in ’ 90 / ‘91 ”
– “ OH !
You ’re from Ariel ! ”
He looks at the “ 3 ” sticker on my bag and shrugs .
He motions the security lady and whispers something in her ear .
The roommate – who was told he ’s not allowed to come in after he was discovered as an Arab– looks on from a distance .
– “ So you speak Hebrew ? ” the bag lady asks as she symbolically opens my bag and closes it with disinterest .
The Nigerian lady beside me is having her bag checked with special sticks .
Every item is laid out and questioned by three security “ experts ” .
– “ I have family in Ariel , ” the bag - checking lady tells me with a smile as she motions me to the next line .
– “ You see what it means to have an Arab friend ? ” my roommate says and apologizes for the interrogation that ’ll probably follow .
I yell at him to never apologize for that again .
This week is Israeli Apartheid Week .
40 Cities this year .
The only analytical article in Ha’aretz was about a South African ( white ) anti-Apartheid activist who argued Israel ’s bad but not apartheid - bad .
For some reason all the white South African activists say it ’s not so bad .
All the black ones say its worse than they had ever imagined .
Update .
Tarachansky responds to Avi , commenting :
Thanks so much for bringing this up .
Although my roommate was n’t traveling with me this time , and therefore was n’t checked , he has a long history of being harassed and labelled all kinds of numbers at the Ben Gurion Airport .
Thankfully , he has an Israeli ID because he ’s a Palestinian from the 1948 borders .
There are many horrific accounts of Palestinians from the 1967 occupied territories that really paint a clear picture of the difference between the treatment I received and the one they do .
' This Planet Tastes Funny , ' According to Spitzer
PASADENA , Calif . - NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope has discovered something odd about a distant planet -- it lacks methane , an ingredient common to many of the planets in our solar system .
" It 's a big puzzle , " said Kevin Stevenson , a planetary sciences graduate student at the University of Central Florida in Orlando , lead author of a study appearing tomorrow , April 22 in the journal Nature .
" Models tell us that the carbon in this planet should be in the form of methane .
Theorists are going to be quite busy trying to figure this one out . "
The discovery brings astronomers one step closer to probing the atmospheres of distant planets the size of Earth .
The methane - free planet , called GJ 436b , is about the size of Neptune , making it the smallest distant planet that any telescope has successfully " tasted , " or analyzed .
Eventually , a larger space telescope could use the same kind of technique to search smaller , Earth - like worlds for methane and other chemical signs of life , such as water , oxygen and carbon dioxide .
" Ultimately , we want to find biosignatures on a small , rocky world .
Oxygen , especially with even a little methane , would tell us that we humans might not be alone , " said Stevenson .
" In this case , we expected to find methane not because of the presence of life , but because of the planet 's chemistry .
This type of planet should have cooked up methane .
It 's like dipping bread into beaten eggs , frying it , and getting oatmeal in the end , " said Joseph Harrington of the University of Central Florida , the principal investigator of the research .
Methane is present on our life - bearing planet , manufactured primarily by microbes living in cows and soaking in waterlogged rice fields .
All of the giant planets in our solar system have methane too , despite their lack of cows .
Neptune is blue because of this chemical , which absorbs red light .
Methane is a common ingredient of relatively cool bodies , including " failed " stars , which are called brown dwarfs .
In fact , any world with the common atmospheric mix of hydrogen , carbon and oxygen , and a temperature up to 1,000 Kelvin ( 1,340 degrees Fahrenheit ) is expected to have a large amount of methane and a small amount of carbon monoxide .
The carbon should " prefer " to be in the form of methane at these temperatures .
At 800 Kelvin ( or 980 degrees Fahrenheit ) , GJ 436b is supposed to have abundant methane and little carbon monoxide .
Spitzer observations have shown the opposite .
The space telescope has captured the planet 's light in six infrared wavelengths , showing evidence for carbon monoxide but not methane .
" We 're scratching our heads , " said Harrington .
" But what this does tell us is that there is room for improvement in our models .
Now we have actual data on faraway planets that will teach us what 's really going on in their atmospheres . "
GJ 436b is located 33 light - years away in the constellation Leo , the Lion .
It rides in a tight , 2.64 - day orbit around its small star , an " M - dwarf " much cooler than our sun .
The planet transits , or crosses in front of , its star as viewed from Earth .
Spitzer was able to detect the faint glow of GJ 436 b by watching it slip behind its star , an event called a secondary eclipse .
As the planet disappears , the total light observed from the star system drops -- this drop is then measured to find the brightness of the planet at various wavelengths .
The technique , first pioneered by Spitzer in 2005 , has since been used to measure atmospheric components of several Jupiter - sized exoplanets , the so - called " hot Jupiters , " and now the Neptune - sized GJ 436b .
" The Spitzer technique is being pushed to smaller , cooler planets more like our Earth than the previously studied hot Jupiters , " said Charles Beichman , director of NASA 's Exoplanet Science Institute at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology , both in Pasadena , Calif .
" In coming years , we can expect that a space telescope could characterize the atmosphere of a rocky planet a few times the size of the Earth .
Such a planet might show signposts of life . "
This research was performed before Spitzer ran out of its liquid coolant in May 2009 , officially beginning its " warm " mission .

" Any jokes or inappropriate remarks may result in your arrest , " says a robotic voice over the Tannoy at Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston , as I join the silent procession of bleary - eyed passengers disembarking from the plane after a ten - hour transatlantic flight .
Welcome , as they say , to the United States .
I 'm in Texas on holiday , making the annual pilgrimage to see my in - laws .
I married an American in 2003 , and each time we return to her homeland I 'm reminded of the New Yorker journalist Hendrik Hertzberg 's description of the " brutal fuck - you that greets foreigners arriving in the United States " , and his call to US immigration officials to stop making " preventive war " on innocent tourists .
" It might make us more friends . "
But making friends is n't high on the agenda at Bush Intercontinental .
This is my ninth trip to Houston since 2000 , and it does n't get any easier .
I attributed a rare smooth entry in March last year to the change in administration , from bellicose Bush to benign Barack .
My mistake .
“ What is the purpose of your trip ? " asks a morose airport official , thumbing through my passport and refusing to look me in the eye .
The badge on his arm says " US Customs and Border Patrol " , part of the department of homeland security .
Perhaps I do n't look happy enough to be here on holiday .
Moments later , I 'm deposited in a homeland security " holding lounge " .
" Why am I here ? " I ask the nearest uniformed officer .
" Random check , " he grunts .
Random ?
I 'm sitting in a room filled exclusively with black , Hispanic and Asian passengers .
Name and shame
Nor is it my first time in this " lounge " .
A few years ago I spent several hours here , detained because my surname matched that of a wanted insurgent inside Iraq .
Yes , " Hasan " - the Middle Eastern equivalent of " Smith " or " Jones " .
Incidentally , I note an addition to the waiting room in the form of a giant map of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Iraq is so 2003 .
Why does my detention matter ?
Is n't my inconvenience far less important than US airport security ?
Of course , but as the former secretary of state Colin Powell remarked in 2007 : " We are taking too much counsel of our fears . . .
Let 's make sure people come to Disney World and not throw them up against the wall in Orlando simply because they have a Muslim name . . .
Let 's show the world a face of openness and what a democratic system can do . "
Time and again we have been told that the " war on terror " is at its core a struggle for hearts and minds .
Not so on US borders , where foreigners are met , in Hertzberg 's words , with " delays , ugliness , sullen contempt and near chaos while being treated alternately as cattle or potential terrorists " .
Despite Hollywood 's best efforts , millions of people across the world no longer consider the US to be " the land of the free and the home of the brave " ( to quote the national anthem ) , the " shining city upon a hill " ( Ronald Reagan ) , or the " indispensable nation " ( Madeleine Albright ) .
Indeed , anti-Americanism is rife .
Some argue it has a long and shameful history , pre-dating even the founding of the United States in 1776 .
In the mid-18th century , the French naturalist the Comte de Buffon - together with Voltaire and the Dutch philosopher Cornelius de Pauw , among others - condemned the " degeneracy " of the inhabitants of the Americas .
But as the British historian Tony Judt points out , anti-Americanism today is not confined to smug intellectuals - European or otherwise .
Most foreigners are untroubled by the cultural dominance of the US , and many even aspire to the so - called American way of life .
" Most of them do n't despise America , and they certainly do n't hate Americans , " Judt writes .
" What upsets them is US foreign policy . . . "
There is evidence to support this .
During the eight years of the Bush administration , with its lawless and bloody wars , positive opinion of the US declined in most European countries .
A Pew Global Attitudes Project poll showed how , between 2000 and 2006 , " favourable opinions " of the US dropped from 83 per cent to 56 per cent in the UK , from 62 per cent to 39 per cent in France and from 78 per cent to 37 per cent in Germany .
In the Middle East , Zogby Inter­national found that negative attitudes towards the US jumped between 2002 and 2004 , from 76 per cent to 98 per cent in Egypt , from 61 per cent to 88 per cent in Morocco and from 87 per cent to 94 per cent in Saudi Arabia - and these are allies of Uncle Sam .
Respondents in most of these countries said they objected , above all , to US foreign policies that they considered unjust .
Love , actually
In Destiny Disrupted : a History of the World Through Islamic Eyes , the Afghan - American writer Tamim Ansary shows how the Middle Eastern view of the US in the early 20th century was much more positive than negative .
Wilsonian idealism was seductive to Arabs living under colonial rule but craving self - determination .
It was , Ansary argues , only after the CIA - funded coup against the secular , democratically elected prime minister of Iran , Muhammed Mossadeq , that anger and disillusionment with the US spread across the region .
Noam Chomsky , bête noire of the right , has long argued that the notion of anti-Americanism itself seeks to excuse the crimes of US elites and " identify state policy with the society , the people , the culture " .
It is an important point .
I condemn the actions of the US government in Iraq , Afghanistan and Yemen , without attacking my American friends in Houston , LA or New York .
“ I am willing to love all mankind , " Samuel Johnson said , " except an American . " I can not agree .
I may be considered anti-American , in that I abhor many US foreign policies , but the person I love most happens to be an American .
America is not the American government .
Nor is it the US border patrol .

This release cycle marks a change to a time - based release process .
Beginning with version 5.11.0 , we make a new development release of Perl available on the 20th of each month .
Each spring , we will release a new stable version of Perl .
One month later , we will make a minor update to deal with any issues discovered after the initial " .0 " release .
Future releases in the stable series will follow quarterly .
In contrast to releases of Perl , maintenance releases will contain fixes for issues discovered after the .0 release , but will not include new features or behavior .
Notable changes in Perl 5.12 include : * Perl now conforms much more closely to the Unicode standard .
Additionally , this release includes an upgrade to version 5.2 of the standard .
* New experimental APIs allow developers to extend Perl with " pluggable " keywords and syntax .
*
Perl now has a better sense of time and will be able to keep accurate time well past the " Y2038 " barrier .
*
New syntax allows developers to specify package version numbers directly in " package " statements *
Perl now warns the user about the use of deprecated features by default .
Perl 5.12.0 features numerous new features , optimizations and bugfixes .

The watchdog group is charging Fox host Sean Hannity failed to fulfill fundraising promises to help children of killed and wounded soldiers .
CREW flags Hannity concert series
A Washington watchdog group formally complained to the Federal Trade Commission on Monday that Fox News host Sean Hannity has played on sympathy for wounded troops to raise money , without fulfilling promises to help children of those killed or injured during wartime .
The Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Freedom Concerts , affiliated with the Freedom Alliance , for falsely promoting that all concert proceeds would be donated to a scholarship fund for the children of those killed or wounded in war .

CREW also asked the Internal Revenue Service to look into the Freedom Alliance for engaging in political activities that are prohibited for tax - exempt 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations such as the alliance .
“ Hannity has promoted the concerts on his show , making statements such as , ‘ Every penny , 100 percent of the donations are applied to the Freedom Alliance Scholarship Fund , ’ ” CREW said in a statement .
But according to CREW Executive Director Melanie Sloan , the amounts promoted do n’t add up to the amounts donated .
The Freedom Concert website says that more than $ 10 million has been raised for the scholarship fund .
According to Sloan , Hannity has said that since 2003 the group has raised $ 2.5 million for scholarships , but after reviewing the spending records , the amount spent on scholarships cannot be more than $ 2.1 million .
“ This is the kind of deceptive marketing that the FTC looks very dimly at , ” Sloan said .
Since Freedom
Alliance does not actually run the concerts , it ’s possible it funds the scholarships by different means , she said .
Premier Marketing , a company run by Duane Ward , markets and manages the concerts .
Ward also runs the Premier Speakers Bureau , which represents Hannity and retired Lt. Col .
Oliver North , founder of the Freedom Alliance and now an honorary chairman .
Ward and North have a long history as well .
Ward ran North ’s legal defense fund in the late 1980s when North was embroiled in the Iran - Contra scandal .
Neither Hannity nor North could be reached for comment Monday .
But the alliance president , Tom Kilgannon , vigorously denounced the complaints as “ baseless . ”
“ There is absolutely no merit to the scurrilous charges launched against Freedom Alliance from two of the most left - wing organizations in the country , ” Kilgannon said in a statement .
“ The smear - mongers who have launched this politically motivated witch hunt against Freedom Alliance will be proven wrong as we aggressively defend ourselves in the days and weeks ahead . ”
It ’s not the first time an independent organization has attacked the fundraising activities of the Freedom Alliance .
In 2007 , according to The Washington Post , the American Institute of Philanthropy , which graded various veterans ’ charities , failed the alliance .
“ If they ’re advertising that they ’re raising money for veterans ’ families , I would expect that 80 to 90 percent ” of the group ’s proceeds would benefit the families of veterans , said Jon Soltz , chairman of VoteVets.org , which is backing CREW .
“ If not every dime is going to those who wore the uniform , then people have the right to know that .
It really is that simple . ”
“ There are many wonderful charities to help troops and veterans that are completely transparent and truthful about where their donations go , ” Soltz added .
“ If Sean Hannity and Freedom Alliance are being untruthful , that hurts all those other charities because it only causes people to hold back donations to worthy causes in the future . ”
In addition to its complaint with the FTC , CREW is charging that the Freedom Alliance is participating in political activities , forbidden by the IRS .
The alliance has a tax - exempt 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status , but it ’s contingent on the group refraining from politics .
In 1999 , Sloan said , the group was warned to steer clear of politics , but it continues to post politically charged columns on its website and host an annual Freedom Cruise , featuring prominent Republican speakers such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele .
“ Very few charities are actually investigated by the IRS , ” she added , unless someone complains .

So , it goes like this .
If it gets passed and legalized then we get taxed and the government can make oodles of money to run social programs and the like , etc , etc , etc , ... sounds alot like the luxury tax or sin taxes on liquor and cigarettes .
Problem is only those who can afford it will purchase it , others will grow thier own for personnal use or otherwise and thus avoid the taxes altogether .
Would you rather buy from a friend tax free or purchase at some store and hand more money to the government ?
Has n't anyone here enjoyed a homebrewed beer made by a friend without having to pay taxes ?
Honestly , whatever it is and the people want it , why the hell must it be taxed ?
wtf !

Africa goes to church , the mosque and the witch doctor
Dr Msilo combines Muslim and traditional beliefs
By Christopher Landau
BBC News , Bagamoyo
In his cramped hut at the end of an alleyway in the coastal Tanzanian town of Bagamoyo , traditional healer Dr Msilo treats patients with a variety of mental and physical problems .
To locals , he is known as a witch doctor , and his treatments involve casting out evil spirits , as well as administering traditional potions .
People are keen to seek out his services , regardless of their religious affiliation .
" God provides medicine for all people - Muslims , Christians and pagans , " he says .
RELIGIOUS AFRICA 77 % of Africans pray at least once a day 48 % of Africans have witnessed or experienced a divine healing 61 % of Africans believe Jesus Christ will return during their lifetime 93 % of Tanzanians believe in witchcraft 71 % of Nigerian Muslims favour making Sharia law the country 's official religion
Ten things we have learnt about Africa " They all know that the trees were given by God , and He gave some people the power to heal . "
The continuing devotion of many Africans to elements of traditional belief is well known .
But Dr Msilo is just one example of a key trend identified in a major new study of African faith .
The Pew Forum interviewed more than 25,000 people in 19 sub -Saharan countries about all aspects of faith and belief .
The results show that the overwhelming majority of Africans in those countries are committed followers of either Islam or Christianity .
Religious harmony
But alongside regular visits to church or mosque , they will also visit traditional healers like Dr Msilo , who offer a connection with the ancient beliefs that pre-date Christianity and Islam in Africa .
AFRICA HAVE YOUR SAY
The blending of religions like Islam and Christianity with African religions is one way of ensuring survival of traditional religions BaDumisani , Berlin
The survey underlines that in most countries , Christians and Muslims live peacefully side by side .
Fewer than one third of respondents felt religious conflict was a problem in their country - though 58 % said it was in Rwanda and Nigeria , where there have recently been clashes between rival communities around Jos .
Where tensions grounded in religious difference do exist , there is a strong correlation with ethnic divisions - as was the case in Jos .
Christians are more likely to regard Muslims as violent than vice - versa .
On average , more than 40 % of Christian respondents associated violence with Muslims , whereas 20 % of Muslims associated violence with Christians .
A key concern identified was the lack of understanding that both Muslims and Christians have of each other .
At a recently established Muslim - only school in Bagamoyo , teachers were struggling to obtain adequate resources .
They compared their facilities with those of Christian schools that attract funding from foreign missionary organisations .
Deputy headmaster Abgala Maropia said that in spite of this inequality , there were generally no tensions between Christians and Muslims in the town .

Tolerance and Tension : Islam and Christianity in Sub-Saharan Africa [ 6MB ]
Download comes from Pew Research Center website .
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here " Here in Tanzania honestly we do n't mind whether one is Muslim or Christian - we live in peace and harmony , " he says .
But other teachers admitted they knew very little about Christian beliefs , and they acknowledged this can lead to misunderstanding .
It is clear that religion is a defining part of most people 's life .
At the fish market , a Muslim women explained that of course she attends prayers five times each day .
She seemed to find it strange that she was even being asking about the significance of religion .
The Pew Forum study found that 93 % of people in Tanzania said religion was a very important part of their life .
Western immorality Both Muslims and Christians would like to see their own religion exerting legal influence within their country .
Some 63 % of Muslims favour the implementation of Sharia law , and just over half believe the Caliphate ( the unification of the Islamic world under a single ruler ) will be re-established during their lifetime .
One of the most consistent Christian responses across all 19 countries concerns the return of Jesus Christ to earth , with 61 % believing it will happen in their lifetime .
But there is also significant concern about the impact of secular influences - particularly Western media .
While most believers admit to enjoying Western film , music and television , there is real concern about its impact on morality .
In Tanzania , 80 % of respondents believe that morality has been undermined by such entertainment .
Getting a wholly consistent picture from such a wide - ranging piece of research is unlikely .
But the Pew Forum 's study underlines the substantial influence of both Christianity and Islam in the countries surveyed .
As sub -Saharan Africa looks to the future , an intriguing attachment remains to the traditional beliefs that many Christian and Muslim leaders condemn .
Though it may be that influences from beyond Africa , not least those available through the power of the internet , may yet contribute most to changes in the religious landscape in future .

CHICAGO --
If indeed LeBron James decides to leave Cleveland , fans in Chicago would certainly hail The King .
They certainly let out enough cheers along with those oohs and aahs as he soared around the United Center on Friday night .
James became the youngest player to score 15,000 career points , breaking Kobe Bryant 's mark by more than two years , and the Cavaliers pulled away to beat the Bulls 92 - 85 for their 12th win in 13 games .
Breaking that record , James said , was " very humbling " and the result of all the time he spends honing his game .
" I was born with a God - given gift , " he said .
" I take full advantage of it by being able to do what I do on the basketball court .
Hopefully , I can continue to stay healthy , and hopefully , I 'll continue to break records . "
James scored 13 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter , giving him 15,026 in his career , and had 11 rebounds .
He scored seven in a row late in the game as Cleveland increased its lead to 10 , sending the Bulls to their 10th straight loss .
James reached the milestone at 25 years , 79 days , and he did it in his 540th game .
Bryant was 27 years , 136 days and playing his 657th game , according to STATS LLC , when he did it for the Los Angeles Lakers .
" There 's not a milestone that I think he 's going to attain that would shock me at all , " coach Mike Brown said .
The question is :
Whose uniform will he be wearing when he reaches them ?
James , who can opt out of his contract after the season , would be the top attraction in a star - studded free - agent class if he decides to leave , and the Bulls will have the salary - cap room to offer a maximum deal .
James praised the Chicago fans , saying , " To respect the way I play the game when they 've seen the greatest basketball player of all time , with tonight it 's real humbling . "
Would James want to keep playing here ?
" I 'm here , " he said .
" They can see me until I catch the plane . "
Mo Williams added 18 points for the Cavaliers , who continued to roll without the injured Shaquille O'Neal .
They 're 10 - 1 with their big man recovering from a thumb injury .
The Bulls hung close without the injured Derrick Rose , Luol Deng and Joakim Noah , but matched their longest losing streak since November 2001 despite strong efforts by rookies Taj Gibson ( 20 points , 13 rebounds ) and James Johnson ( 16 points ) .
" It 's really frustrating right now , " veteran Kirk Hinrich said .
" I do n't know how else to explain it . "
James , who reached the 15,000 - point mark in the opening minutes , put away the Bulls in the closing minutes .
He checked back into the game with just over 7 minutes left and Chicago up 75 - 74 and immediately delivered a two - handed alley - oop dunk , hanging on the rim .
He hit back - to - back jumpers before a 3 - pointer by Anthony Parker gave Cleveland an 83-78 lead with about 4 minutes left , and James scored seven straight after a dunk by the Bulls ' Gibson to make it 90 - 80 with 50 seconds left .
At one point after he checked back in , James turned toward the Chicago bench and asked : " Do you want to shoot it ?
I 'll shoot the ball . "
The loss simply added to the misery for the Bulls .
Deng could miss two to three more weeks because of a strained right calf , putting his status for the rest of the season in question .
Rose has now missed four straight because of a sprained left wrist he sustained in a collision with Orlando 's Dwight Howard .
He is a gametime decision for Saturday at Philadelphia , as is center Joakim Noah , who has missed the past 10 games with plantar fasciitis in his left foot .
The injuries came at a bad time for the Bulls , who just wrapped up a stretch of nine straight against contenders , yet they hung in against the team with the league 's best record .
James soared in for a hard right - handed dunk on a break about 4:40 into the game and hit two free throws about 40 seconds later , giving him 15,001 career points .
Otherwise , he was rather quiet until the fourth .
" I was trying to make him a shooter , not let him drive whenever he wanted to , " Johnson said .
Game notes
Cavs C Zydrunas Ilgauskas was back in the Cleveland area three days before he is eligible to re-sign with the Cavaliers .
He declined to comment to The Associated Press on Friday following a workout at a suburban gym , but agent Herb Rudoy said in an e-mail that he 'll talk to GM Danny Ferry next week .
An abused battered wife has had enough of husband beating up on her .
Everywhere she turns for help , there 's not much anyone will do .
After he rapes her one night , she sets the bed on fire with him in it asleep .

Clock - related issues are a scourge of sysadmins worldwide .
Even so , who would have expected the National Australia Bank ( NAB ) needed scheduled downtime to cope with the regular annual ending of daylight savings time ?
Fellow tech journalist and blogger Dan Warne is presently in the United States and I was keenly following his tweets as he sought to purchase a new Apple iPad on its launch date .
Warne turned up at the San Francisco Apple store braving eight degree Celsius ( 46 degrees Fahrenheit ) cold , noting his surprise both at how short the queue of iPad - hunters was on arrival , and then how swiftly it grew to over 200 hopefuls .
Yet , when it came to Warne 's turn to hand over his hard - earned for one of Steve Jobs ' latest must - have gadgets , he was let down - not by Apple , not by his own bank balance , not even by the complex infrastructure of global inter- banking connections .
His transaction was repeatedly declined .
Being 3 am on Sunday Australia time Warne battled to find someone at the National Australia Bank ( NAB ) who would take his call .
Eventually he made it through to the 24 - hour lost - cards line .
The operator explained there was no problem with Dan Warne 's card .
While such a problem would be frustrating and embarrassing , a reasonable explanation would have to be accepted and acknowledged .
The truth was worse in my opinion ; the entire NAB systems - card transactions , Internet and telephone banking - were down .
The reason the operator gave was that they were down deliberately ' for daylight savings . '
In a stroke of unfortunate timing , 10 am Saturday in San Francisco happened to coincide with the transition from daylight savings time in NSW , Australia back to regular time .
At the stroke of 3 am the clock went back to 2 am , to relive that hour all over again .
Any reasonable person can appreciate the problems daylight savings causes for transaction - based systems .
You can have transactions occurring at 2:01 am , 2:59 am , then 2:01 am again , for instance .
In the industry I work in during my ' day job ' we have many skilled workers punching in attendance at time clocks .
We always need to cater for the fact someone who works across the daylight savings split is due an additional hour 's wages and this is coded into timeclock and payroll software .
I felt Warne 's pain at waiting in line for something he keenly wanted and then having his card declined through no fault of his own .
After I digested that , I felt a secondary twinge of discomfort - because , to be honest , it truly bugs me that in this day and age there are organisations who need downtime to cater for what is , frankly , a predictable event .
If the NAB told Warne an unexpected outage occurred that 'd be bad enough but that happens ; you can get over it and you know in your own business you sometimes have unfortunate events that prevent you giving the level of service you would prefer .
However , to require downtime to cater for something which happens each and every year on dates known years in advance genuinely stuns me .
In fact , it even raises the question of whether the NAB does deal with the issue of daylight savings or just avoid it by turning everything off over that magical repeated hour so they have no out - of - order transactions .
On the one hand , you can appreciate downtime at 3 am Sunday is not going to affect the bulk of Australians , but for those it does affect - both at home and abroad - it 's more than a minor inconvenience .
Imagine being left without funds and without explanation because your bank chose to ignore an issue rather than deal with it ?
In my industry we deal with it .
We make it work .
We do n't tell our workers and our clients we can't supply labour for that hour .
Then again , we do n't charge our clients for the privilege of being clients either .
David deserves a lot of credit for getting this one done .
Â
It may not seem like a lot of work , but getting from the conceptual point to this was a massive undertaking .
Â
If you were unaware , the strip parallels the actual God of War video game fairly close .
Yes , this strip is filled with lots of grammar jokes that only nerds will appreciate .
Â
We prefer to think of it as possibly a fun way to teach kids grammar , which of course , seems to be in clear contradiction to our last strip where we mocked â€œlearning is funâ€ ideas .
New rappers are like California fires -- the intensity is still the same as it was 20 years ago , but more people now have matches .
Sadly , they 're all choosing to light up in the same spot .
Everybody wants a major deal .
It makes you wonder how many more crooked deals will be dealt before newcomers finally decide to promote their art independent of the strings of majors .
Aligning with a major label offers few benefits beyond the spoils of fame and the facade of a panoramic lifestyle .
Let 's examine the merits and demerits of being on a major label , shall we ?
Fame
Sure , having the long - reaching tentacles of majors will help deliver your product to the masses and bring you ample exposure .
The problem is that new artists often get peanuts on their percentages in exchange for fame .
Who wants to be a broke but famous star ?
Advances
It 's true that you 're likely to get large advances from majors .
That said , just remember that you have to pay back the advances and recordings costs from your royalty rate as applied to actual sales .
When your records no longer shift those monstrous units , you 'll find that you 're stuck making money for a label even if the passion and financial benefits are long gone .
It 's like taking a loan that ties you to your creditor long enough to limit your long - term success .
Sales
Ah , the main objective of every one who 's ever picked up a mic .
If you made an argument in favor of sales 12 years ago , I would 've nodded in agreement and slapped you a high - five .
A cursory glance at recent record sales , however , shows an industry on its knees .
Every dime spent on promoting an artist 's record , from video production costs to radio promo , is recoupable from his royalty points ( with few exceptions , of course ) .
When , say $ 300,000 of income goes to the label , only about 10 % of that goes towards recoupment .
This way , you 'll have to shift a million units to see substantial revenue from royalty points .
The Age Old Major vs Indie Argument
It 's a surprise that newcomers , who clearly have respectable artistic goals , are n't deciding to pass up opportunities to sign to majors .
Drake , for instance , had an opportunity to buck tradition and stick it to the majors .
He had already gathered reams of buzz .
His mixtapes were moving like hot cakes .
He had an opportunity to debut in the Top 10 as an independent artist .
In the end , he chose to play ball with the same people who passed on him when he was just Wheelchair Jimmy .
On the flip side , Chicago outfit the Cool Kids and New Orleans MC Jay Electronica have shown that it 's possible to attain reasonable success sans the backing of a major .
Did you hear the one about Cool Kids co-headlining a North American tour with the Clipse in 2009 ?
That 's an indie act with no full - length album co-headlining a tour with a major act .
Lucrative deals with the likes of Nike and EA Sports stand as a testament to the Chicago duo's ability to leverage their music for indie success .
Similarly , Jay Electronica managed to build a cult - like following as an indie artist and continues to do so now that he 's signed to Jay Z's Roc Nation .
Indie labels like Rhymesayers , Duck Down , and Stone 's Throw Records have all managed to stay relevant for decades while consistently dropping quality albums .
Everyone seems to be jostling for the top spot these days , but the smart ones have figured out that the middle is where the gold lies .
Quality vs Quantity
One area that illuminates the disparity between majors and indies is album packaging .
Sometimes it takes an album that offers a combination of quality music and unique packaging to get a consumer 's attention .
Brent Rollins , the mastermind behind many classic hip - hop album covers ( including Freeway & Jake One 's Stimulus Package ) laments that big labels are more reluctant to invest in superior packaging .
" When I work with large labels , " says Rollins , " it ’s like pulling teeth just getting them to use something like a metallic ink on an album cover .
Sometimes they talk about something like 5 cents out of a dollar extra to do something .
I know that adds up when you ’re printing a lot of them , but we ’re talking about giving something back to people . "
While large record companies are typically less enthusiastic about embracing new ideas , independent labels have always been synonymous with creative liberty .
Others might continue to seek the rat race that is wooing a major label , but diligent artists will seize every available opportunity to steward their future and change the game .
Take it from Courtney Love , who 's seen both the good and the ugly side of major deals .
" If a record company has a reason to exist , it has to bring an artist 's music to more fans and it has to deliver more and better music to the audience .
You bring me a bigger audience or a better relationship with my audience or get the f --k out of my way . "
House on Fire
This is not to suggest that major record cartels are no longer relevant .
They are .
Previously undiscovered artists can benefit from the huge promotional break a major has to offer .
It takes a plenty of funds to break a new artist -- funds most artists do n't have on their own .
But it 's important to weigh the pros and cons of signing to a major before making the plunge .
What 's the real cost of signing a freaking 5 - album major deal in the long run ?
What does it mean when an artist has to recoup , say $ 250,000 of her promo budget while the label earns 10 times that amount ?
Keep in mind that most artists makes $ 0 from royalty points until recoupment is clear .
That 's sad .
The music industry is a burning house and people are running into the building with more gasoline instead of trying to douse the fire .
Will this be the generation that finally capsizes a broken system or will it be the one that settles for the okey - dokey ?
Will this be the generation that revolutionizes music business or will it be the one that settles for a stint in the belly of the beast ?
Comcast , the US ' largest cable company has been involved in a bitter fight with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) over the principles of Net Neutrality , the essence of which would require broadband providers to give equal treatment to all Internet traffic .
As many commentators have described ( here for instance ) , the FCC has been plainly overstepping its own charter in order to claim any kind of jurisdiction .
Additionally , never mind the lack of FCC credibility , the whole idea of enforced equality of data is plain stupid and would lead to the rapid and total demise of all broadband companies ; for it is the very ability to discriminate between various kinds of data that permits these organisations to actually make money .
A long time ago , this author made a similar analysis of Telstra 's revenue stream on the basis of the likely price of a downloaded new - release video and how the amount of data contained in that download compared with the prices charged for voice traffic .
In essence , a $ AU15B revenue stream dwindled to just $ AU25 M ; a similar argument can be mounted for all instances of variable - priced data - one ends up being forced to apply the lowest price per MB for all traffic .
One would hope this is the end of the issue , but do n't be at all surprised if the FCC makes a strong representation to the US Government to ' fix ' the problem .

The above YouTube video shows off rough samples
I knocked up of all the voices I plan to record for Hedgewars .
As my
free time is becoming increasingly limited , I decided that rather than choosing the order of production based on what I like , I would leave that decision up to you !
Sounds good !
How do I vote ?
Some notes on these samples !
As my professional recording mic is currently on loan to a friend , I 've knocked up these samples with my old mic , so expect a fair bit of popping and distortions .
Also please note there is a possibility that the lines I have used will not show up in the game , as many were said in the spur of the moment and some may even be deemed offensive .
These samples are designed to give you an idea of the general sound a voice will have , so please vote accordingly !
What if I 'd rather have another kind of voicepack ?
If you have any other voicepack ideas and requests , please feel free to suggest them here !
These samples are based on what has been suggested so far and what has been feasible for my voice range .
For instance , I am well aware that some of you would like to see a female voice pack , however I feel this is something that would best be done by an actual woman , so I am attempting to get one of my friends involved in the production .
And that 's it !
Hopefully you guys can all find something you like !
Feel free to leave feedback and I 'll be posting the results at the end of the month !
You will need to make a comment on this post listing the three voices you would most like to see in the next release of Hedgewars .
At the end of the month , I will be tallying the votes and the most popular choice will be featured in the next version !
There is a good possibility that the 2nd and 3rd place entries will be included too , it largely depends on how much time I am able to spare for recording .
Perhaps no other element of the book - making process receives as much input from as many different people as the jacket .
First , a creative director comes up with an idea .
( How about this image of an apple ? )
Then the book ’s editor , author and agent have a look .
( Can we enlarge the font size on the author ’s name ?
And was n’t an apple used for that book about vampires ?
This book is n’t about vampires . )
The publisher of the imprint gets involved .
( Vampires sell .
I like the apple . )
The sales force makes comments .
( Is n’t there an economics angle ?
How about an apple with an orange inside ?
That ’s worked before . )
Even booksellers have an opinion .
( What I really love on a cover is a pair of high heels . )
A good jacket is unlikely to save a bad book , of course .
But in a crowded market , a striking cover is one advantage all authors and publishers want .
To get a sense of the odds , in a random analysis of 1,000 business books released last year , Codex Group , a publishing consultant , found that only 62 sold more than 5,000 copies .
Even in the digital era , publishers believe that books need graphic representations  if only for the online marketing campaign .
Regardless of the format , “ they all seem to need what we know of as a cover to identify them , ” said Chip Kidd , associate art director at Alfred A. Knopf .
Mr. Kidd has designed more than 1,000 jackets for authors including Cormac McCarthy and James Ellroy .
The music industry went through a similar transition when digital music devices arrived , but it has pushed back by finding fresh ways to display CD cover art on the Web sites where the songs are bought and the iPod screens where they are played .
Publishers have already had some experience tailoring book jackets for the digital world , since so many people now buy even their print copies online .
“ We often get requests to make the type bigger , ” said Mario J. Pulice , creative director for the adult trade division of Little , Brown & Company .
“ Because when it ’s on Amazon , you ca n’t read the author ’s name . ”
As publishers explore targeted advertising on Google and other search engines or social networking sites , they figure that a digital cover remains the best way to represent a book .

Some readers expect makers of electronic devices to add functions that allow users to broadcast what they ’re reading .
“ People like to show off what they ’re doing and what they like , ” said Maud Newton , a popular book blogger .
“ So eventually there will be a way for people to do that with e-readers . ”

HOW big is too big ?
The former premier Bob Carr says Australia 's population should be capped at 28 million .
A federal Labor backbencher , Kelvin Thomson , says 26 million .
The Stable Population Party of Australia says 23 million .
The Greens want an inquiry to settle the matter .
The Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , says there is no ideal number , just what Treasury projects will happen : 35 million by 2050 .
'' That 's what 's happening , '' is Rudd 's relaxed reply .
That is indeed what 's happening , according to the latest population snapshot by the Bureau of Statistics .
The population grew by a little over 450,000 people in the year to September .
That is the equivalent of the entire population of the ACT and then some .
About one - third of the increase came from natural factors : births minus deaths .
The remaining two - thirds came from net overseas migration : arrivals minus departures .
Rudd has said he is a supporter of a big Australia , and the Herald , too , has warned against knee - jerk calls to cut migration at a time of skills shortages .
But it is increasingly clear that our ability to sustain a larger population depends on the planning abilities of state and federal governments , and it is here that the Herald wavers .
The housing shortage is already approaching crisis levels .
A lack of new supply is pushing the prices of existing homes beyond what young home buyers can afford .
The public transport systems of our cities also need investment .
The challenge of managing our scarce water supplies has never been greater .
Given that most new arrivals to this country choose to settle in established cities , a bigger population will put an even greater strain on existing infrastructure .
Strong migration is one of the factors which helped Australia to avoid a technical recession last year .
But what matters in the long term and what drives improvements in living standards is what we do with our existing population .

WASHINGTON  Top federal food regulators threatened on Friday to ban caffeinated alcoholic drinks unless their makers quickly proved that the beverages were safe .
In a statement , the Food and Drug Administration said it had told nearly 30 manufacturers of the drinks that unless they could provide clear evidence of safety , it would “ take appropriate action to ensure that the products are removed from the marketplace . ”
Officials did not say how long such a determination might take .
The drinks , which combine malt liquor or other spirits with caffeine and fruit juices at alcohol concentrations up to about 10 percent , have become increasingly popular among college students .
In a news conference , Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein , the agency ’s principal deputy commissioner , said their consumption was associated with increased risk of serious injury , drunken driving , sexual assault and other dangerous behavior .
The agency ’s action was prompted by a letter from 19 state attorneys general , who expressed concern about the products ’ safety .
Japan 's Honda Motor gives a demonstration of the company 's prototype model of a new electric motorcycle called the " EV - neo " at the company 's research and development center in Wako , suburban Tokyo .
The company said it initially plans to target domestic business customers such as pizza delivery services .
Japan 's Honda Motor on Tuesday unveiled its latest electric scooter , saying it initially plans to target domestic business customers such as pizza delivery services .
The EV - neo is powered by a lithium - ion battery that matches the performance of a 50 cc petrol engine , without the noise , and can travel 30 kilometres ( 19 miles ) on a single charge at up to 30 kilometres per hour .
The battery can be rapid - charged up to 80 percent of capacity in 20 minutes , while a regular power socket charge would take about four hours , said the Japanese auto maker .
Honda promoted the scooter as " quiet and clean and contributing to creating a low - carbon society " as it unveiled a prototype of the two - wheeler at a research facility on the outskirts of Tokyo .
Honda plans to start leasing the scooter to Japanese companies from December , said a spokeswoman , without disclosing the price tag or production targets .
" The distance it can travel may not be satisfactory for personal use , but eventually we want to make it available for individual customers , " she said .
No international sales plans were announced for the electric scooter , Honda 's second since it released 200 units of an earlier model to Japanese business customers in 1994 .
Japan 's motor giants have recently emerged as global leaders in low and zero emission cars meant to reduce urban pollution and cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
Toyota 's Prius hybrid has been the top - selling car domestically for nearly a year , while Nissan is rolling out its Leaf electric car later this year , competing with Mitsubishi Motors ' i- MiEV .

What critical rationalism is for
There are two main questions that I want to discuss ; the first is :
How do we know what we know , and how can we tell whether it is true or not ?
This may seem an academic topic , but in a world where people believe in alien abductions and astrology , fall for the claims of advertisers , politicians and media moguls , and vote for the suppression of important branches of science in schools , I think it is actually a matter of real importance .
The second question is :
What is the best way to solve problems ?
" Problems " is used in a wide sense here : you are in a given situation , and you would like to change it .
Life , in this sense , is series of problems , and so is the acquisition of new knowledge .
The second question depends on the first , because all problems depend on having the right information for their solution , and the more we can rely on this information , the better .
Knowing a fact and knowing generally
There are two kinds of information .
One is the " here and now " kind , the isolated fact : it 's raining , there is fish for dinner , this is a dagger I see before me .
Obviously , this kind of knowledge can be important , for example if a car is bearing down on you .
But most important information ( and most misinformation ) consists of generalisations : most rain in California falls in the winter , the British are reserved , e=mc2 , the average temperature of the world is rising ( you ca n't measure the average temperature , only the temperature in a finite number of individual places ) .
We could not manage without generalisations .
Imagine a shop assistant who had to be trained in advance to deal with every possible customer who could walk into the shop .
The assistant has to make generalisations about customers in order to work .
All scientific theories and laws are generalisations .
The problem of induction Philosophers in the past commonly believed that achieving generalised knowledge consists of this procedure : you observe lots of isolated facts and examples , recognise what all of them have in common , and use that common factor to make the generalisation .
This is called induction .
They also recognised that there is a problem with this procedure .
In most cases , you can't check out every example yourself , or even find people to do it for you .
How can you know that the next example , which you have not yet seen , will fit the generalisation ?
The traditional case used by philosophers was the statement " all swans are white " : how do you know the next swan you see will not be black or some other colour ?
( If you go to Western Australia , you can actually see black swans . )
Information obtained by induction can never be totally reliable : even if it is true , we have no way of ever knowing that it is .
Inductive logic has been important to life , as Pavlovian association embodies a kind of inductive logic .
Perhaps this is because it often provides a high margin of safety : once a creature associates a situation with pain , it will avoid that situation again , increasing its chances of survival and opportunity to transmit its genes .
But it is not a basis for understanding subtle details and connections between things .
The cat that jumps on a hot stove will avoid all stoves , not just hot ones , in the future .
Inductive thinking can have destructive effects : many hateful statements are made about ethnic and religious groups that are really inductive thinking in disguise .
Despite all this , inductive thinking is highly valued in Western society .
If you are good at it , you will score well on intelligence tests and be admired for your high IQ , and may even be admitted to Mensa .
But it is a blind alley off the intellectual highway .
Being negative about positivists Popper was particularly concerned about the nature of science , how it works , and how we can know that scientific knowledge is true .
Science has turned out to be the most powerful way of understanding our universe , but no - one really understood why .
There was a group of philosophers called the " logical positivists " , who believed that all scientific statements were statements that could be confirmed .
They rejected all other statements as being meaningless .
But , as we have seen , scientific theories and laws are generalisations .
We can't just collect confirming examples and use those to prove the theory , because we run up against the problem of induction .
In fact , you can go on collecting confirming examples all your life , and the theory you are trying to prove could still be false .
Collecting confirming examples is the basic technique of pseudoscientists like Velikovsky .
Typically , this involves collecting legends from around the world that fit the theory .
Any other information collected is rejected as irrelevant ( or twisted to fit the theory ) .
Consider a drug that was tested using only confirming examples .
The tester records all the people who are cured using the drug , but throws away the details of those who die during the tests .
Would you be happy using the drug ?
Being positive about negative things
We have seen that the practice of confirmation can give us no confidence in our generalisations .
Yet generalising and abstracting from specific instances in the real world is the most powerful feature of human thought .
It enables us to predict things in the future , respond to situations we have never encountered before in a rational way , and reason productively about the connections between and the causes of things .
Scientific laws and theories are often regarded as the most reliable kind of knowledge we have .
What 's wrong here ?
Do we always have to believe that our knowledge is uncertain and dependent on the pure chance that we have hit on the right generalisation ?
Some philosophers may argue from this that all knowledge is totally uncertain , that there is no knowable physical reality , that all knowledge is relative to the culture of the person concerned , and so on .
But Popper argued that , although absolute certainty about things in the world is impossible , there is such a thing as objective knowledge about the world , and that with the right method we can always approach closer to it .
Turning confirmation on its head : falsification Popper pointed out that , although you can't confirm a generalisation , you can falsify it .
In the simplest cases , all you need to do is find a counter - example to the generalisation , for example , a swan that is not white .
This suggests an ( in principle ) straightforward method of testing theories .
Instead of looking for confirmation of a theory , which carries no guarantee of the truth of the theory , and may waste a lifetime , it is much better to look for counter - examples �to the theory .
This may mean that the theory is quickly disproved and abandoned , but so much the better , because a bad theory is a waste of time and a hindrance to the advance of knowledge .
If we have a theory , it should predict new observations .
We test those predictions against all the new evidence we can find , in an attempt , not to prove it , but to disprove it .
If , despite all our efforts , the theory still survives and explains the new evidence successfully , we can at least be sure that the theory is better than all the others yet advanced .
This attitude encourages radical thinking .
Instead of hanging on to dead ideas , we should try out new ones all the time , but subject them to the severest of criticisms .
Hence the name , " critical rationalism " ,
We should be daring in our hypotheses , but once we have created them , we should be rigorous in testing them against observation and experiment , and willing to ditch them when they fail the tests .
Of course , trying to disprove your own ideas runs counter to what many people would regard as " common sense " , but so also do many of the discoveries of science .
Reasoning involves questioning the lazy assumptions of " common sense " .
Two misunderstandings about Popper
To try to clear up one common misunderstanding : Popper did not� suggest that unfalsifiable statements are necessarily " meaningless " : this is an idea of the logical positivists that does not apply in critical rationalism .
There are many areas of human thought in which meaningful things can be said but for which the falsification criterion may not be appropriate .
These include ethics , aesthetics and religious thought , for example , except where they claim to make objective statements about the external world .
Another confusion is with the linguistic philosophers , who insisted that the important thing is to define the words that you use .
On the contrary , critical rationalism insists that the important thing is to tackle profound problems , not to fuss over word meanings .
The idea is to express problems in such a way that you can devise appropriate solutions for them , and test the solutions against new evidence .
How can critical rationalism be used ?
Many scientists now use Popper 's philosophy as a guide .
The cycle of hypothesis and criticism fits in well with the long - established practice of peer review of all research before it is published in scientific journals .
This practice ensured that a critical process was applied to scientific results and theories long before Popper described what was happening .
Of course , no critical process can guarantee absolutely against fraud and error ; the activity of science is a human activity , and no human activity can ever be perfect .
CR tells us that we have to live with this , but that we can at least do the best possible in the circumstances .
Popper did not stop at science , though .
He applied the ideas of CR in other fields of thought , in particular the philosophy of politics and society .
Popper 's life included the periods of the major totalitarian philosophies of the 20th century , Nazism , Soviet communism and Maoist communism .
Much of Popper 's thought was concerned with the nature of authoritarian systems , and how they obstructed rather than enabled the pursuit of human ideals .
He promoted two main ideas here .
One was the idea that progress ( however you conceive it ) must require the freedom to subject all ideas to rigorous criticism , because otherwise false ones may flourish .
This requires an open society where debate and criticism are freely allowed .
The second idea is that there is no inevitable " march of progress " .
Both Nazism and communism promoted some kind of ideal future that each was inevitably bringing about in its own way : this notion is called historicism .
In fact , human activity brings about both intended and unintended consequences , and the unintended consequences are by their nature unpredictable .
We need the open society , so that all political and social activities can be openly monitored and freely criticised and corrective action taken in the political sphere .
Popper covered these ideas in his books The Open Society and Its Enemies � ( two volumes ) and The Poverty of Historicism .
In particular , he is known for his critique of Marxism , the driving force behind early communism , and one of the major influences in 20th century thought .
Critical rationalism in practice CR is a practical guide to knowledge and action .
It offers guidance in acquiring new information , in assessing the validity of information offered by others and in taking action to solve problems using the information that is to hand .
Unlike some other so - called " philosophies " , it does not offer a solution to everything or an infallible guide to all the problems of life .
In fact , CR shows that there can be no such things .
We have to work within the limits of our knowledge , knowing that we can never have the whole truth and we can never be certain about the consequences of our actions .
It is because science and technology work within these limitations that they have become the most successful of all knowledge - driven human activities .
I shall attempt to summarise the main guidance of critical rationalism in a few points : Subject all theories and ideas , your own and other people 's , to the most rigorous criticism , trying to falsify the ideas by finding countervailing evidence .
Do not become bogged down in searching for confirming examples - if your idea is good , you will find plenty of those in your attempt to disprove the idea .
the ideas by finding countervailing evidence .
Do not become bogged down in searching for confirming examples - if your idea is good , you will find plenty of those in your attempt to disprove the idea .
Be as creative and adventurous in your ideas as you can be .
As long as you subject those ideas to the most rigorous criticism , it does not do any harm to have wild ideas .
Be alert to the unforeseen consequences of actions , and be prepared to change the ideas that led to those consequences .
Promote the " open society " in whatever sphere you have influence : in most cases , encouraging creativity in ideas , open debate on those ideas and continual review of the consequences will be the surest means to solving a problem .
But always bear in mind that there is no certainty .
Do what you can , whether it is small or great : do not be deterred from your ideas by the fact that you can never achieve certainty or perfection .
Although I have not discussed ethics here , I believe that all actions should be guided by a system of ethics .
Since the application of ethics has practical consequences , the application of those ethical rules should be assessed as rigorously as any other ideas .
Are these guidelines easy to carry out ?
Certainly not .
They involve continual application of criticism to your own ideas , as well as to those of others .
It is difficult to criticise one 's own ideas , which is why one needs debate and dicussion with others , but is also difficult to accept criticism , as we all know .
To apply CR successfully , one needs to be fully aware of how one is applying criticism to ideas , and also of one 's emotional reactions .
Other people may not share the values encouraged by CR , and may not welcome criticism of their ideas .
This needs care and tact ( which we do not all have in equal measure ) .
But realise that other people 's reactions can be part of the unforeseen consequences of our own actions ( see above ) .
Some value systems emphasise not criticising others , lest they lose face .
But , in the long run , cultures that suppress open debate end by settling their differences in violence and bloodshed .
Popper emphasised that CR is a way of " letting our ideas die in our stead " .
Personally , I sometimes get depressed by the way that debate often turns out on the Internet : criticism of an idea ( not of a person ) is followed by a personal attack on the character and motives of the other person , or with assertions that the other person has views that he or she does not possess .
CR can help here : assess what you know of the other person ( which may simply be through the words you have seen posted ) and apply falsification to any attempt to extend your " theory " about the other person beyond what you actually know .
Our ideas exist independently of ourselves , and an argument should be treated separately from the person who advances it .
The validity of an idea does not depend on the character or behaviour of the person who first put it forward .
Recognising this opens the way to more productive and more peaceful debate .

Labour and the Conservatives are tied in the marginal seats that will determine the result of the election , according to a new poll which shows a hung parliament is increasingly likely .
The Times / Populus survey of 100 Labour - held seats found that although the Tories are performing better in the marginals than in the country as a whole , they currently lack the support necessary to guarantee David Cameron an overall majority .
The poll put Labour on 38.2 per cent in the key seats , down from 45.3 per cent in the 2005 election .
The Conservatives are on 37.6 per cent , up from 31.4 per cent .
The figures mean the Tories could expect to gain 97 Labour - held seats .
The party would need to win up to 20 further seats from the Liberal Democrats and others for an overall majority .
The survey excluded the 50 most marginal Labour seats , which the Tories are expected to easily win , but included those Cameron needs to secure a majority .

Being around a pretty woman can make men take more risks , a new study finds .
Researchers looked at the risk - taking behaviors of 96 young adult men , with an average age of nearly 22 , by asking them to do both easy and difficult tricks on skateboards .
First , the young men performed the tricks in front of another man , then in front of a young , attractive female .
( The attractiveness of the woman was independently assessed by 20 male raters . )
The testosterone levels of the skateboarders were measured after each trick .
Testosterone is a male sex hormone that fuels sexual interest , arousal and activity , and is also associated with increased competition and risk - taking .
When skateboarders attempt tricks , they make a split - second decision about whether to abort the trick or try to land it , based on a mid-air evaluation of the likelihood of success and on the physical costs that failure might bring — such as falling flat on their face .
It was that moment the researchers sought to examine , because it resembles the type of risky decisions that young men make when behind the steering wheel of a car or when in physical confrontations with each other .
As a group , young males are at the highest risk of early death of any group in industrialized countries in part because they are the biggest risk - takers .
As the researchers expected , the skateboarders took greater risks in the presence of the attractive female , even when they knew there was a greater chance they could crash .
Along with this increased risk - taking , the young men had higher testosterone levels when they performed in front of the female than when they did their jumps in front of another guy .
" This experiment provides evidence for an effect that has existed in art , mythology , and literature for thousands of years : Beautiful women lead men to throw caution to the wind , " wrote the authors of the study , Richard Ronay and William von Hippel , of the University of Queensland in Australia .
" These findings suggest that , for men , the adaptive benefits gained by enticing mates and intimidating rivals may have resulted in evolved hormonal and neurological mechanisms that facilitated greater risk - taking in the presence of attractive women , " they added .
The results of the research are detailed in the first issue of the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science .
* Ruling is the fourth against autism claims
* Court says mercury preservative did not cause autism
WASHINGTON , March 12 ( Reuters ) - Vaccines that contain a mercury - based preservative called thimerosal cannot cause autism on their own , a special U.S. court ruled on Friday , dealing one more blow to parents seeking to blame vaccines for their children ’s illness .
The special U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that vaccines could not have caused the autism of an Oregon boy , William Mead , ending his family ’s quest for reimbursement .
“ The Meads believe that thimerosal - containing vaccines caused William ’s regressive autism .
As explained below , the undersigned finds that the Meads have not presented a scientifically sound theory , ” Special Master George Hastings , a former tax claims expert at the Department of Justice , wrote in his ruling .
The Meads had filed a civil lawsuit in Oregon state court against a number of pharmaceutical companies alleging that the thimerosal additive in many pediatric vaccines significantly contributed to the development of William ’s autism , Hastings wrote .
While the state court determined the autism was vaccine - related , Hastings said overwhelming medical evidence showed otherwise .
The theory presented by the Meads and experts who testified on their behalf “ was biologically implausible and scientifically unsupported ” , Hasting wrote .
In February 2009 , the court ruled against three families who claimed vaccines caused their children ’s autism , saying they had been “ misled by physicians who are guilty , in my view , of gross medical misjudgment ” .
The families sought payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program , a no - fault system that has a $ 2.5 billion fund built up from a 75 - cent - per - dose tax on vaccines .
Instead of judges , three “ special masters ” heard the three test cases representing thousands of other petitioners .
They asked whether a combination vaccine for measles , mumps and rubella , or MMR , plus a mercury - containing preservative called thimerosal , caused the children ’s symptoms .
MYSTERIOUS CONDITION
More than 5,300 cases were filed by parents who believed vaccines may have caused autism in their children .
The no - fault payout system is meant to protect vaccine makers from costly lawsuits that drove many out of the vaccine - making business .
Autism is a mysterious condition that affects as many as one in 110 U.S. children .
The so - called spectrum ranges from mild Asperger ’s Syndrome to severe mental retardation and social disability , and there is no cure or good treatment .
The U.S. Institute of Medicine has reported several times that no link can be found between vaccines and autism .
In a separate matter , the U.S. Supreme Court said earlier this month it would decide whether a federal law protects vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits in state court seeking damages for alleged design defects .
The high court agreed to hear a Pennsylvania case involving a lawsuit by the parents of a child who suffered seizures after her third dose of a diphtheria - tetanus - pertussis vaccine .
They sued the vaccine manufacturer , Wyeth , which Pfizer Inc PFE.N purchased last year .
I am re-posting this fun counterfactual in honor of October 19th Love Your Body Day .
Crossposted at Jezebel .
I was thinking the other day about fashion advice for women with different body types .
The advice is almost always aimed at getting women ’s bodies , whatever shape they might be , to conform with one ideal body type : the ( skinny ) hourglass figure .
The advice video below , sent in by Tara C. and aimed at women with “ pear - shaped ” bodies , does exactly this ( excerpts and commentary after the clip ) :
So , the advice , as I mentioned , is all about trying to hide the shape of her actual body and make it appear to be more hourglass .
To “ transform it into an hourglass , ” they say :
“ slim your hips and thighs ”
“ draw attention to the upper part of your body ”
“ balance your figure ” with shoulder pads
“ a roomy top will de-emphasize your bottom ”
“ offset your hips ”
“ avoid side pockets , they add bulk where you least need it ”
I wonder what it would be like to live in a world where the fashion industry encouraged us to “ emphasize ” our differences from one another , instead of trying to make us all look the same .
If you were pear - shaped , for example , the advice would be all about highlighting that awesome booty and tiny waist and shoulders .
Work that pear - shape !
If you were broad - shouldered and thin - hipped , the advice could all be aimed at broadening your shoulders ( shoulder pads and fancy necklines ) and thinning your hips ( dark colors and no pockets ) !
Work that triangle - shape !
If you were apple - shaped , advice would be aimed at looking rounder with even skinner arms and legs .
Work that apple - shape !
If you were petite , advice could be aimed at looking smaller ; if you were tall , advice could be aimed at looking larger .
If you had short legs , advice would tell you how to elongate your torso ; if you had long legs , advice would tell you how to shorten it .
I think this would be a super fun world to live in .

But the idea that the Government should step in to force the Financial Regulator to reverse his entirely correct decision to apply to the court for the appointment of a provisional administrator to run the business is utterly wrong , no matter how much Seán Quinn himself or his employees want that .
The campaign that Quinn employees and supporters have launched is emotional and it must seem persuasive to those not in command of the real facts .
The myth of Seán Quinn is a substantial one as can be seen from this representative selection of comments supplied to one website over the past week :
“ This country is being run by a shower of muppets and it ’s them that needs to go , not a hardworking man like Seán Quinn , who has given so much to the economy , ” said one contributor ... !
Another : “ It ’s a terrible thing to see an Irishman treated in this way without trial .
An Irishman that has been forced to stop trading in the UK because of an “ Irish ” regulator .
An Irishman employing 5,500 people ( mostly on this island ) .
An Irishman that treats his employees well .
A proud Irishman humiliated in this way ...
And another : “ He has almost single - handedly contributed to the tremendous improvement in the employment rate in the region .
As a result of his endeavours , well - educated young people can remain living in their home counties .
I ’m dismayed at the speed at which the regulator placed Quinn Insurance into provisional administration ; Quinn should have had more time to meet any requirements outstanding at Quinn Insurance .
This move by the regulator is heavy - handed and creates anxiety among employees , customers and the general population . ”
While I do n’t doubt the sincerity of those involved in the campaign to have Quinn Insurance returned to its original owner , the objective is bone - headed .
Instead of marching on the Dáil the employees should turn their attention to their hero and point the finger of blame at him and , appropriately for a man who started in quarrying , his feet of clay .
The real truth is that Seán Quinn is entirely responsible for the mess that he has created , despite his denials , and is entirely incapable of sorting it out , despite his claim that he should just be let get on with fixing his mistakes .
Quinn has ruined his own empire financially but , unfortunately , there are many other people who will bear the costs .
Three years ago he engaged in reckless gambling and everyone else in the country is now paying the price for his arrogant stupidity .
Quinn did n’t just invest badly in buying Anglo Irish Bank shares with his own spare cash : he borrowed excessively to do so and he also borrowed from the Quinn Insurance company without the relevant permission from the authorities .
He hid the extent of his share - buying too – as the Central Bank would have investigated his suitability to own more than 10 % of the bank had it known about it – and then was allowed to become involved in a highly dubious transaction to sell some of the shares to try and reduce his exposure to heavy losses .
It did n’t work .
Quinn ’s gambling on the stock market has cost him and his group more than €3bn , as he admitted recently in an RTÉ interview .
This is far more than he had admitted previously .
Quinn Group owes € 2.8 bn to Anglo Irish Bank and a further € 1.3bn to Barclays Bank and a group of bondholders .
The Anglo loan is a disgrace .
Although it was first described in 2008 as being for “ general corporate purposes ” , it is clear that much of it was to cover his losses on the purchase of shares in Anglo itself .
The assumption that the loan was secured over the assets of the entire Quinn Group is only partly true .
The bondholders and Barclays have prior preference and have to be repaid first from the sale of assets .
This is what makes their charge over assets of subsidiaries of Quinn Insurance so important .
Insurance companies , as part of their entitlement to conduct business , have to hold sufficient assets that can be used to pay insurance claims .
The amount of unencumbered assets is actually € 445 million less than had been thought , once proper analysis is applied .
This means that instead of being solvent Quinn Insurance has a deficit of more than € 200 m .
The big question is how Matthew Elderfield ’s predecessors at the Financial Regulator ’s office failed to act earlier .
The regulator has maintained it was not given the relevant information even though Quinn Insurance was required to disclose the existence of the guarantees in its solvency returns .
The Quinn Group maintains the guarantees to other lenders were disclosed in the accounts of subsidiaries of Quinn Insurance , but these accounts were not available in the Companies Registration Office because the accounts for the insurance business are consolidated .
This implies the relevant information was as good as hidden , although Quinn has insisted the information was available at all times to the regulator .
However , Quinn ’s track record in this regard is not good .
It has had a history of investing the premiums entrusted to it in businesses and properties tied either to Seán Quinn ’s ownership or his stock market gambling .
Quinn Insurance received the heaviest fine ever handed down by the regulator – € 3.25 m in 2008 – for the improper lending of money to Quinn for his stock market gambling .
The excuse that the money was subsequently repaid only cuts it so far because it would seem to have borrowed effectively from Anglo Irish , which now means us .
Quinn was fined € 200,000 personally and told to disengage from management of the company .
It was a far lighter punishment than his recklessness deserved .
There are good grounds for believing Quinn Insurance should have been taken into administration back then .
I ADMIT that in July 2008 I wrote about Quinn ’s importance to the Irish economy and his willingness to create jobs in areas where nobody else , especially state agencies , would have borrowed .
However , it soon became clear that his gamble on Anglo Irish was a lot bigger than had been believed and that it had not been done with his own money .
As the saying goes , “ when the facts change , I change my mind . ”
The more I have learnt about Quinn ’s way of doing business the less impressed I have become .
He seems to believe that all of the rules should be bent to suit him .
His political lobbying of recent weeks has been jaw - dropping .
Whereas he is clearly in the wrong he thinks nothing of impugning the name of the regulator and of encouraging others to do the same .
He seems to think the Government should step in and return his business to him .
It would be insane for it to do so .
The workers in Quinn Insurance face an uncertain future because a new owner might reduce their numbers or relocate functions , but new ownership is their best chance of survival .
What happens to the wider Quinn Group is also a matter of considerable interest , but believing its future is best left to Seán Quinn flies in the face of the fact that this gambler should have played his last hand and should now leave the table .

Sean Quinn ’s career is detailed in his book , Who really runs Ireland ?
The Minnesota Twins and Joe Mauer have agreed on the third richest contract in baseball , an eight - year , $ 184 million deal that will keep their MVP in the Twin Cities well into what may be a Hall of Fame career .
Mauer , who turns 27 next month , trails Alex Rodriguez ( $ 275 million ) and Derek Jeter ( $ 189 million ) of the New York Yankees with his new deal after leading the AL in batting average , on - base and slugging percentage last season .
The deal includes a full no - trade clause and begins in 2011 , meaning he could be a Twin through the 2018 season .
He will receive $ 23 million a year between 2011 and 2018 .
The agreement comes on a day the Twins could use some good news .
Their All - Star closer , Joe Nathan , will miss all of the 2010 season because of elbow surgery .
If the Mauer extension talks dragged into the regular season , it might have cast a pall over the opening of Target Field , the Twins ' much - anticipated open - air stadium .
Instead , there will be much to celebrate , as the Twins clearly are intent on using enhanced revenues from their new stadium to retain their new core of superstars , after a decade in which they developed Torii Hunter and Johan Santana into All - Stars , only to see them become too expensive to retain .
That wo n't be happening with Mauer , a native of the Twin Cities whose forthcoming signature on the new deal will ensure he 'll retain his rock - star celebrity status there .
Mauer 's contract , of course , is the richest in team history , surpassing first baseman Justin Morneau 's six - year , $ 80 million deal .
Morneau is signed through 2013 .
The Twins have scheduled a Monday night press conference at their spring training home in Fort Myers , Fla. to officially announce the signing .
Mauer 's deal continues a busy spring for the Twins , who earlier wrapped up contract extensions with outfielder Denard Span and starting pitcher Nick Blackburn .

Capitol
Hill now has an indie butcher .
And an indie cheese monger .
And we get these riches on the same day .
The Calf and Kid Artisan Cheese Shop and butcher Rain Shadow Meats opened for business this morning in the still - under - construction Melrose Project .
We stopped by for a few pictures and to find out how things are going in the new spaces .
Rain Shadow ’s Russ Flint said he ’s still figuring out the cash register but reported that his first Friday sale was a cut of grass fed , rib eye steak .
For a little more on Flint , see ‘ Meet the Melrose Market butcher . ’
Around the market , construction continues on the spaces that will eventually be home to Sitka and Spruce and Homegrown Sandwiches .
Meanwhile , Sheri Lavigne also was settling in for her first day in business at the counter across from Rain Shadow .
Lavigne reports that Calf and Kid ’s first transaction was for a slab of grande queso from Blue Rose Dairy of lovely Winlock , Washington .
We profiled the new Cap Hill biz owner here .
Both shop owners said they ’ll be open to at least 7 PM tonight but Lavigne said she ’ll hang around as late as people keep buying cheese .
Regular Saturday hours are 11 AM to 7 PM and 12 PM to 6 PM on Sundays .
You can find both shops and the recently opened flower shop Marigold and Mint at 1515 Melrose Ave.

Twice a month , we revisit some of our readers ’ favorite posts from throughout the history of Nettuts +.
Regular Expressions are the Swiss Army knife for searching through information for certain patterns .
They have a wide arsenal of tools , some of which often go undiscovered or underutilized .
Today I will show you some advanced tips for working with regular expressions .
Adding Comments
Sometimes , regular expressions can become complex and unreadable .
A regular expression you write today may seem too obscure to you tomorrow even though it was your own work .
Much like programming in general , it is a good idea to add comments to improve the readability of regular expressions .
For example , here is something we might use to check for US phone numbers .
It can become much more readable with comments and some extra spacing .
Let 's put it within a code segment .
The trick is to use the ' x ' modifier at the end of the regular expression .
It causes the whitespaces in the pattern to be ignored , unless they are escaped ( \s ) .
This makes it easy to add comments .
Comments start with ' # ' and end at a newline .
Using Callbacks
In PHP preg_replace_callback ( ) can be used to add callback functionality to regular expression replacements .
Sometimes you need to do multiple replacements .
If you call preg_replace ( ) or str_replace ( ) for each pattern , the string will be parsed over and over again .
Let 's look at this example , where we have an e-mail template .
Notice that each replacement has something in common .
They are always strings enclosed within square brackets .
We can catch them all with a single regular expression , and handle the replacements in a callback function .
So here is the better way of doing this with callbacks :
Now the string in $ template is only parsed by the regular expression once .
Greedy vs. Ungreedy
Before I start explaining this concept , I would like to show an example first .
Let 's say we are looking to find anchor tags in an html text :
The result will be as expected :
Let 's change the input and add a second anchor tag :
Again , it seems to be fine so far .
But do n't let this trick you .
The only reason it works is because the anchor tags are on separate lines , and by default PCRE matches patterns only one line at a time ( more info on : ' m ' modifier ) .
If we encounter two anchor tags on the same line , it will no longer work as expected :
This time the pattern matches the first opening tag , and last opening tag , and everything in between as a single match , instead of making two separate matches .
This is due to the default behavior being " greedy " .
" When greedy , the quantifiers ( such as * or + ) match as many character as possible . "
If you add a question mark after the quantifier (.*? ) it becomes " ungreedy " :
Now the result is correct .
Another way to trigger the ungreedy behavior is to use the U pattern modifier .
Lookahead and Lookbehind Assertions
A lookahead assertion searches for a pattern match that follows the current match .
This might be explained easier through an example .
The following pattern first matches for ' foo ' , and then it checks to see if it is followed by ' bar ' :
It may not seem very useful , as we could have simply checked for ' foobar ' instead .
However , it is also possible to use lookaheads for making negative assertions .
The following example matches ' foo ' , only if it is NOT followed by ' bar ' .
Lookbehind assertions work similarly , but they look for patterns before the current match .
You may use ( ?< for positive assertions , and ( ?<! for negative assertions .
The following pattern matches if there is a ' bar ' and it is not following ' foo ' .
Conditional ( If - Then - Else ) Patterns
Regular expressions provide the functionality for checking certain conditions .
The format is as follows :
The condition can be a number .
In which case it refers to a previously captured subpattern .
For example we can use this to check for opening and closing angle brackets :
In the example above , ' 1 ' refers to the subpattern ( < ) , which is also optional since it is followed by a question mark .
Only if that condition is true , it matches for a closing bracket .
The condition can also be an assertion :
Filtering Patterns
There are various reasons for input filtering when developing web applications .
We filter data before inserting it into a database , or outputting it to the browser .
Similarly , it is necessary to filter any arbitrary string before including it in a regular expression .
PHP provides a function named preg_quote to do the job .
In the following example we use a string that contains a special character ( * ) .
Same thing can be accomplished also by enclosing the string between \Q and \E .
Any special character after \Q is ignored until \E .
However , this second method is not 100 % safe , as the string itself can contain \E .
Non-capturing Subpatterns
Subpatterns , enclosed by parentheses , get captured into an array so that we can use them later if needed .
But there is a way to NOT capture them also .
Let 's start with a very simple example :
Now let 's make a small change by adding another subpattern ( H.* ) to the front :
The $ matches array was changed , which could cause the script to stop working properly , depending on what we do with those variables in the code .
Now we have to find every occurence of the $ matches array in the code , and adjust the index number accordingly .
If we are not really interested in the contents of the new subpattern we just added , we can make it ' non-capturing ' like this :
By adding '? :' at the beginning of the subpattern , we no longer capture it in the $ matches array , so the other array values do not get shifted .
Named Subpatterns
There is another method for preventing pitfalls like in the previous example .
We can actually give names to each subpattern , so that we can reference them later on using those names instead of array index numbers .
This is the format : (? P pattern )
We could rewrite the first example in the previous section , like this :
Now we can add another subpattern , without disturbing the existing matches in the $ matches array :
Do n't Reinvent the Wheel
Perhaps it 's most important to know when NOT to use regular expressions .
There are many situations where you can find existing utilities than you can use instead .
Parsing [ X]HTML
A poster at Stackoverflow has a brilliant explanation on why we should not use regular expressions to parse [ X] HTML .
... dear lord help us how can anyone survive this scourge using regex to parse HTML has doomed humanity to an eternity of dread torture and security holes using regex as a tool to process HTML establishes a breach between this world and the dread realm of corrupt entities ...
Joking aside , it is a good idea to take some time and figure out what kind of XML or HTML parsers are available , and how they work .
For example , PHP offers multiple extensions related to XML ( and HTML ) .
Example : Getting the second link url in an HTML page
Validating Form Input
Again , you can use existing functions to validate user inputs , such as form submissions .
More info : PHP Data Filtering
Other
Here are some other utilities to keep in mind , before using regular expressions :
strtotime ( ) for parsing dates .
Use regular string functions for matches and replacements , if your pattern does not contain regular expressions .
Examples : str_replace ( ) vs. preg_replace ( ) , explode ( ) vs. preg_split( ) , strpos ( ) vs. preg_match ( )

Boots and Mothercare are selling baby bottles made with a chemical that scientists fear may cause breast cancer , heart disease , obesity , hyperactivity and other disorders , The Independent can disclose .
The behaviour of Britain 's biggest infant - products retailers contrasts with that of manufacturers , who have quietly stopped putting bisphenol A , or BPA , into baby bottles " to allay parents ' fears " , amid peer - reviewed studies in medical journals associating it with serious health problems in laboratory animals .
Canada and three US states , Connecticut , Minnesota and Wisconsin , have banned BPA in baby bottles and the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) says it is concerned about its impact on babies and young children , and supports its removal from infant - feeding products .
However BPA , a synthetically - produced hormonal substance which is added to plastics to make them tougher , is legal in Britain and most of the rest of the world , and Boots and Mothercare , the biggest retailers in Britain 's £ 141 m - a - year infant - feeding market , have continued to sell off old stock containing the controversial chemical without labelling it on packaging .
Boots , the country 's biggest chemists ' chain , also sells BPA bottles branded with Disney characters made by another firm , Tommee Tippee , which has removed BPA from its own bottles .
In the US , the six biggest baby bottle firms including Disney stopped making BPA products last year following scientific outrage at the then failure of the FDA to tackle its potential impact .
Other infant - feeding brands such as NUK have already removed BPA from British bottles .
Boots , Mothercare and Disney insisted BPA bottles were safe , even though they have ordered its removal from current production .
Mothercare said : " Mothercare takes the issue of product quality and safety extremely seriously and all our bottles and feeding equipment comply with strict European standards . "
It added that it offered " reassurance and advice " to customers through its website and leaflets , which advise users to ensure polycarbonate bottles were " free from scratches or signs of wear , to replace them after six months ' usage and not to use boiling water " .
But Mothercare admitted that it was only continuing to sell BPA bottles because its timetable for removal had slipped .
Britain 's biggest mothering and infant - product retailer had planned to stop selling BPA bottles by January 2010 ; now the target was " the end of the autumn " .
Mothercare said : " We anticipated that there would be a phasing - in period , during which time the new BPA - free stock would replace the previous ranges .
However , the timescale of that phasing - out period has taken longer than we originally expected and we now anticipate that all our stock in stores will be BPA - free by the autumn . "
Boots , owned by the private equity company KKR , said : " With the exception of Canada , polycarbonate , which is made from bisphenol A , is approved as a food - contact material worldwide .
The vast amount of scientific evidence still supports its continued safe use . "
Disney acknowledged that British parents were being offered different products to their counterparts in the US , where its BPA bottles are no longer on the shelves .
By contrast , colourful Winnie - the - Pooh - branded bottles made last year are still on sale in the UK , three months after their last production date .
A Disney spokeswoman , Sandra van Vreedendaal , said : " As far as Europe is concerned they have said that amount of BPA does not pose a threat to human health .
They consider the use of BPA to be safe .
However we have decided to move to totally BPA - free with a final target of 2010 .
A number of our products in Europe are already BPA - free . "
She added : " No Disney - branded Tommee Tippee products have been manufactured since 1 January , so any products in the market are old stock and will be phased out in time . "
Breast Cancer UK has launched a campaign calling for the removal of BPA from baby products .
Clare Dimmer , chair of trustees at the charity , said : " It 's amazingly cynical that , despite the serious health concerns surrounding infant BPA exposure , retailers and manufacturers still find it perfectly acceptable to continue to sell BPA stock here despite similar products already being withdrawn from sale in the US and Canada .
" I think parents will be irate about these double standards and disappointed that retailers are not taking on board the full advice from scientists . "
According to independent scientists , BPA may be an underlying cause of a collection of illnesses rapidly rising in the West , including obesity , heart disease , diabetes , fertility problems and birth defects .
Concern is greatest about its transmission from pregnant mothers to babies in the womb , and on young children .
One of a class of chemicals known as endocrine disruptors , BPA interferes with the release of the female hormone oestrogen , and its impact is greatest on disorders associated with metabolism , fertility and neural development .
BPA is widely available in tins of food and canned drinks , where it is used to toughen the internal lining of tins .
It is also used in a wide array of plastic products such as mobile phones , computers and medical equipment .
Hundreds of studies have been conducted on BPA , most of which have found harm to laboratory rodents and primates , and studies looking at the effects of BPA in humans have also found links to ill - health .
However , several studies funded by the chemical 's manufacturer and involving large numbers of laboratory rodents have given BPA a clean bill of health .
Regulators such as the Food Standards Agency have relied on this small number of industry - based studies in reaching their assessments that BPA is safe .
However , in January , the US FDA reversed its long - held position that BPA was harmless and announced it favoured its withdrawal from baby bottles – and would support the canning industry 's search for alternatives .
Scientists have claimed that the American chemical industry has been overly powerful in its influence on the FDA , sparking a backlash from independent scientists prior to its U - turn .
In December , seven experts from five British universities including London , Ulster and Stirling wrote to the Health Secretary Andy Burnham calling for a review of BPA .
A spokeswoman for Born Free , one of many BPA - free brands , said : " We believe that BPA has been one of the most studied chemicals for decades for a reason .
Recent scientific research suggests that small amounts of BPA may leach into foods or beverages stored in polycarbonate containers , especially when the contents are acidic , high in fat , or heated .
" Research also suggests that BPA may act as an endocrine disruptor , a substance which mimics natural human hormones , and that babies and growing children are particularly at risk from exposure because they are still undergoing many hormone - mediated developmental processes .
" We believe that the use of BPA in baby - feeding products should be banned in its entirety .
It is for this reason that our entire product portfolio has always been and always will be free from harmful chemicals such as BPA . "
Breast Cancer UK's Ms Dimmer added : " Several hundred independent scientific studies have been published in peer - reviewed academic journals over the last decade that have established the low - dose effects of BPA .
" These studies include research conducted on cell cultures as well as mammalian animals and have identified potential increased risks in a whole host of chronic health conditions , including breast and prostate cancer , liver disease , diabetes , obesity , and even a potential impact on brain function .
Scientists have also identified that young children and infants have the highest levels of exposure to BPA as they are less able to clear this chemical from their bodies . "
She added : " This is especially troubling as infants and young children are in a rapid state of growth and development , and are potentially more susceptible to risks of exposure to BPA . "
Professor Vyvyan Howard , professor of bioimaging at Ulster University , said regulators should adopt the precautionary avoidance of bisphenol A . " With our own children , who were breast - fed , we obtained glass feeding bottles for water and fruit juice , " he said .
" I consider that the weight of evidence is such that routine use of polycarbonate products should be avoided during pregnancy and for young infants . "
A spokesman for Cancer Research UK said the evidence on BPA was insufficient to alarm parents .
" No direct link between bisphenol A and breast cancer risk has been shown in humans , " he said .
" Some results from animal studies or work on cells in the laboratory point to the need for more research in this area .
" We acknowledge that there are some concerns about bisphenol A and its effects on other areas of human health .
But it would be wrong to worry women unnecessarily about their risk of breast cancer based on what we know . "
In The Independent tomorrow : more coverage of bisphenol A
Case study : ' The Government is not moving quickly enough in banning BPA in products '
John and Alison McHugh , an IT consultant and a strategic marketing manager , have been married for three - and - a - half years and live with their 13 - month - old son , John - Patrick , in south Glasgow .
Last year , the couple , both in their thirties , started the blog www.mindfulmum.co.uk after learning about the harmful affects of bisphenol A ( BPA ) .
" Before Alison was pregnant , we had researched different recyclable plastics so we could find out how to be greener , and that 's how we learnt about the harmful elements that are present in many plastics , " said John .
" But as soon as she became pregnant , like any parent , we stepped it up a gear .
Such things move from an interest to a real concern .
" We consciously sought out BPA - free products during and after the pregnancy .
We do n't eat tinned food because of the BPA in them and we use glass baby - feeding bottles because they are recyclable and they are BPA - free .
We did use some plastic ones but ensured they were BPA - free , like those made by BornFree .
" There is also BPA in some weaning products and we made sure we avoided any we were worried about , and very carefully checked all of the labels to see what they were made of .
" The fact that products containing BPA are still being sold without obvious labelling is atrocious .
Mums have busy schedules and do n't have time to decipher minuscule writing on the back of products to learn what they contain .
Manufacturers have a responsibility to label their products appropriately .
" The Government should follow in the footsteps of Canada and a number of states in America by banning BPA in products but they 're just not moving quick enough .
There 's just no excuse .
" There are parents writing on the blog who were not aware of the effects and fear that their child may have been exposed .
The best advice we can give is to stay healthy and take folic acid , as research indicates this can reduce the effects .
" Parents should remember , though , that this is not their fault .
It 's the Government 's for not moving fast enough and the manufacturers ' for not being diligent enough . "

Baby bottles :
What the manufacturers say
AVENT
The original Philips Avent reusable bottle is made from polycarbonate and contains BPA .
However the company makes BPA - free alternatives made from polyethersulfone or polypropylene .
Avent said " Philips AVENT provides a range of solutions as a result of feedback from our consumers and discussions with our trade partners .
We have expanded our existing range of BPA - free feeding solutions to provide parents with the choice they need .
Philips looks to the authorities to guide us with regards to the materials we use . "
BOOTS
The company said it had stopped putting BPA into its own - brand bottles , but was selling off old stock containing BPA .
Boots also sells Winnie the Pooh - branded bottles containing BPA .
Boots said " All new Boots own - brand baby bottles are made from polypropylene , which does not contain BPA .
The full range of Boots own - brand baby bottles is now free from BPA and there are only a small number of the now - discontinued Boots own baby bottles containing BPA on sale within some Boots stores . "
BORN FREE
The company 's products have always been free from BPA .
It argues that checkout staff should warn customers they are buying feeding bottles that contain BPA .
Born Free said " We believe that BPA has been one of the most studied chemicals for decades , for a reason .
Recent scientific research suggests that small amounts of BPA may leach into foods or beverages stored in polycarbonate containers , especially when the contents are acidic , high in fat , or heated .
Research also suggests that BPA may act as an endocrine disruptor , a substance which mimics natural human hormones , and that babies and growing children are particularly at risk from exposure because they are still undergoing many hormone - mediated developmental processes .
At present only those products sold that are free from BPA are highlighted as such to consumers . "
MOTHERCARE
The company aims to become BPA - free by the end of 2010 .
It advises customers buying polycarbonate bottles to ensure that bottles are free from scratches or signs of wear , to replace them after six months ' usage and not to use boiling water .
Mothercare said " In early 2009 Mothercare introduced its new BPA - free own - brand ranges into stores .
We anticipated that there would be a phasing - in period , during which time the new BPA - free stock would replace the previous ranges .
However , the timescale of that phasing out period has taken longer than we originally expected and we now anticipate that all our stock in stores will be BPA - free by the autumn .
Mothercare takes the issue of product quality and safety extremely seriously and all our bottles and feeding equipment comply with strict European standards . "
NUK
BPA - free bottles were " filtered through " from April 2009 .
The company is still phasing out BPA in Germany and other countries on the Continent .
NUK said " We moved to being BPA - free in 2009 .
That was as a result of listening to the concerns of parents .
It took away any unnecessary anxiety .
There 's nothing wrong with BPA bottles .
There 's no strong claim to say there 's anything harmful in them .
There 's no scientific evidence that BPA leaches out .
It 's a concern for parents and just because we could go BPA - free , we did . "
TOMMEE TIPPEE
The company removed BPA from its feeding bottles in January 2009 , but it continued making Disney - branded bottles containing BPA until the end of 2009 .

Is that all ? ”
Customer : “ Oh , also , how much extra would it cost to have my pie be 16 slices instead of 8 ?
Because I ’m really hungry tonight . ”

With the switch to Python 3 a new WSGI version is necessary .
This talk will focus the problems and possible solutions for web applications to move to Python 3 both on the lower WSGI level and how it will affect applications written in Django and other WSGI frameworks .
Will Hardy Free the Developers
Off - the - shelf Django apps are great for system admins and users .
But what true , perfection - loving Django developers really want are domain - specific frameworks , and they need them to be a little less opinionated .
By offering a flexible framework , tailored to your domain of expertise , you 're offering so much more to the fussy Django developer .
I 'll discuss some ways of doing this and open the floor up to contributions from the public .

Best of both worlds - deploying Django applications with Capistrano and supervisord While Django is a great Web framework , there are places where Python ecosystem falls short of its competitors .
However , nothing prevents us from picking the best parts to create a mixed environment that is productive and nice to work with .
I will present my approach to deployment of Django webapps controlled by supervisord , using Capistrano - an automated deployment tool belonging to the Ruby on Rails ecosystem - and my capistrano - offroad package that adapts Capistrano for non-Rails applications .
I will also talk about release management process , based on the Git version control system , upon which the deployment setup is built .

“ If I ’m honest , I can never feel ashamed . ” ~ Shinedown , “ Some Day ”
There is a certain beauty in living life with honesty .
While the benefits of and motivations for choosing “ honesty ” in life are many — including that truthfulness and honesty are integral to one ’s sense of moral integrity — living a life of honesty ultimately means having little to regret .
What does it mean to live with honesty ?
Living with honesty is less about persistently resorting to truth over deception , and is more about living your life in a way that is “ honest ” to who you are on the inside — your strengths , your gifts , and your passions , as well as your beliefs and morals .
In other words , when we discuss the merit and importance of “ living with honesty , ” we ’re focusing on what it means to be true to yourself — to not deceive yourself into living for the wrong reasons , like pursuing a career based upon someone else ’s demands or expectations .
How do we live with honesty ?
Living with honesty begins with simple introspection .
Ask yourself , are you being true to who you are on the inside ?
Is what you ’re pursuing in life ( as a parent , a professional , etc. ) fulfilling your passions , your life goals , or your fullest potential ?
Are you chasing after what you most desire ?
Are you doing what would be best at doing ?
Could maximize your potential any further ?
Are you most positively helping the lives of others ?
Are you deceiving yourself into living your life for the wrong reasons ?
Choosing to live a life based on others ’ assumptions or expectations will ultimately leave you regretting the past and wishing that you could do it all over again .
On a personal level , I took a job for the wrong reasons after graduating college .
I made the decision because I felt that it was expected of me ; that I “ ought ” to take a job in politics because that was my “ career trajectory ” after graduating with a bachelor ’s degree in political science and having had many internships in State and federal government — in spite of growing increasingly turned off by the political sphere .
When it dawned on me that I was n’t being true to myself and that I was n’t being honest with myself , I moved in a different direction — one in which I strive to live my life for the right reasons .
I have n’t looked back .
What is the benefit of living with honesty ?
Being true to yourself should undoubtedly help lead us to what most of us strive for in life — some form of fulfillment .
For , if we stay true to ourselves and to our nature , we ’re all the more likely to pursue something about which we are passionate ; when our careers or life goals are driven by what we love , we ’re so much more likely to find that sense of fulfillment .
Most importantly , staying true to yourself means that will ultimately have little to regret in the end .
Regardless of whether you succeed or fail , when you stay true to yourself the choices and decisions you make every day are seldom ever regretted because your motivations for those choices and decisions were not influenced by ulterior motives or anyone other than yourself .
And having so little to regret from living with honesty is something truly beautiful .
Senate Republicans on Tuesday warned President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE he ’ll face serious opposition to his Supreme Court nomination if he uses a landmark campaign finance case as a litmus test for a nominee .
Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) invoked Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts ’s name in a Senate floor speech Tuesday warning Obama not to nominate someone who would be an automatic vote against corporate interests .
He made it clear such a nomination could provoke a GOP filibuster .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The big corporation might have the right law and facts in a particular case , ” said Kyl , who noted that Roberts in his own confirmation hearing said that in a dispute between a “ big guy and little guy ” he would vote for whoever had the law behind him .
“ You do n’t go on to the bench [ saying ] , ‘ I ’m always going to be against the big guy , ’ ” said Kyl .
The tough words followed reports that Obama could be searching for a candidate willing to work to overturn the Supreme Court ’s 5 - 4 decision in the Citizens United case , which allows corporations and unions to spend unlimited funds on individual campaigns .
Obama criticized the court ’s decision in his State of the Union address , prompting a battle with the court ’s conservatives , including Roberts .
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito , who attended the State of the Union , was seen mouthing the words “ Not true ” during Obama ’s criticism ; Roberts called Obama ’s comments “ very troubling . ”
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs later fired back that the only troubling thing was the ruling , which he said would lift the floodgates on corporate spending on behalf of candidates in elections .
Obama referenced the case again when he made his first public comments about retiring Justice John Paul Stevens , stating he would be looking to nominate someone , like Stevens , who knows that “ in a democracy , powerful interests must not be allowed to drown out the voices of ordinary citizens . ”
Obama had offered similar comments about powerful interests in criticizing the Citizens United case .
Hours after Kyl ’s speech , Obama sought to show a bipartisan approach to the confirmation battle , inviting members of both parties to a White House meeting next week to discuss the court vacancy .

“ Everybody ’s got their pet case , ” he said .
“ But it ’s really not appropriate to extract promises on specific issues . ”

“ It ’s odd to be lectured to about campaign finance reform from a guy who has raised a billion dollars ” during his presidential campaign , he said .
Senate Democrats , however , showed they ’re ready for a battle over the Citizens United decision in the context of the court fight .
After Kyl ’s speech , Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Pa. ) also highlighted the case , specifically mentioning the ruling as an example of conservatives ’ intellectual dishonesty when criticizing judicial activism .
“ Let ’s be candid about the Supreme Court being an ideological battleground today , ” Specter said .
“ That happens to be a fact .
When some decry judicial activism , what could be more judicial activism than reversing the 100 - year precedent that corporations may not engage in political advertising , as the Supreme Court did in Citizens United ? ”
He then criticized Roberts for swearing not to “ jolt the system ” during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing .
“ Well , there have been quite a number of jolts in the system with his key vote , ” Specter said .
Other senators suggested that the Citizens United case would come up during the confirmation process as part of a larger theme to address what Democrats view as conservative activism run amok on the Roberts court .
The ruling will continue to make headlines throughout the early summer as Democrats in Congress , led by Sen.

As the lead author of the military commissions legislation that has been subjected to years of Supreme Court scrutiny , Graham is particularly interested in prospective nominees ’ views on national security and the laws of war .
He had kind words for Solicitor General Elena Kagan , a leading candidate among roughly 10 centrist to liberal judges and lawyers Obama is considering .
“ I like her , ” he said , quickly adding , “ and that might hurt her chances . ”
Graham was pleased with Kagan ’s answers about national security and the president ’s broad authority to detain enemy combatants when she was going through her own Senate confirmation .
He said Obama is president and should have the right to choose Supreme Court justices as long as the person is well - qualified and not too extreme .
He also noted that he did n’t think Obama would want to challenge Republicans to a pitched Supreme Court battle after spending so much political capital on passing healthcare reform .
“ After healthcare , I do n’t see why Democrats would want to be spending their summer defending a wide - eyed liberal , ” he said .
East Longmeadow , Massachusetts ( CNN ) --
The phones are ringing off the hook at the parish of St. Michael 's Church , where the Rev. James Scahill called in a sermon last weekend for the pope to resign over the church 's sexual abuse scandal .
Pope Benedict XVI has found himself tied to the crisis after news broke last month that 30 years ago , when he was an archbishop , he approved accommodations in his diocese for a priest accused of child sex abuse so the priest could undergo therapy .
The priest , who was not identified , was let go from church service in 2008 , according to church officials in Germany .
" If he can't take the consequences of being truthful on this matter , his integrity should lead him , for the good of the church , to step down and to have the conclave of cardinals elect a pope with the understanding that the elected pope would be willing to take on this issue , not just in promise , " Scahill said .
His church has received more than 100 emails and dozens of calls , of which only two were negative , Sister Betty Braughan said .
Scahill , a longtime critic of the sexual abuse crisis in the church , said the Vatican is responsible for the controversy and believes that it is wrong to blame the media for perpetuating the scandal .
" I have met with countless victims of abuse .
I have lives I can relate this to , and you know anyone with an ounce of intelligence knows the media has not created this scandal , " he said .
" The institutional church has brought this onto themselves . "
The priest complimented the church on its programs for better protection of children over the past eight years but added , " The last temptation , the greatest treason , is to do the right thing for the wrong reason . "
The church took action after years of sexual abuse only because it had been exposed through the media , Scahill said .
Although he has received great support from his parishioners , he admits it has been hard to speak out against the church and the pope .
" This has not been a healthy thing for me .
It 's a lot of stress , but I believe the truth needs to be spoken , and I believe the people want to hear the truth and [ that ] they are sick of the smoke and mirror approach . "
Bishop Timothy McDonnell , whose diocese includes Scahill 's parish , said it was a sad irony that Scahill gave his sermon on Divine Mercy Sunday , " a day on which the church throughout the world re-affirms Christ 's forgiveness , reconciliation and mercy towards all his followers . "
From CNN's State of the Union , John Boehner with his daily dose of fear mongering on closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay .
Heaven forbid we can't try them here because their friends might come and get us .
CROWLEY : One last question , and this is on terrorism .
And Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and civilian trials versus military tribunals .
It appears that there may be a deal in the works which the president would reverse the Holder decision -- Attorney General Holder 's decision to try these 9 - 11 suspects in a civilian court to perhaps a military tribunal in exchange for money to bring some of these prisoners they can't try and put them in a super - max wherever they decide .
Is that acceptable to you ?
BOEHNER : We 'll have to see what the final pieces of this look like .
But we have -- we have a world class facility at Guantanamo .
And -- and --
( CROSSTALK )
CROWLEY : But they 're going to close that .
You know that ?
I mean --
BOEHNER : Well , no they 're not .
They -- they keep saying they are .
But they want $ 500 million from this Congress to rehabilitate this prison in northwest Illinois .
I want to see who the members are who are going to vote for this .
I would n't vote for this if you put a gun to my head .
CROWLEY : But it 's such a -- Guantanamo Bay has such a bad feel to it across the world .
And that 's one of the reasons given for -- fine -- it 's a great facility .
But it 's one of the reasons that people in the world looked at America and thought they have really strayed from their value system .
So if you were to move -- which has been a very important Republican point on foreign policy .
If you were to move these trials into a military tribunal , why not say , " Fine , bring them ?
Guantanamo Bay has a bad feel to it .
Let 's put them in a super max and be done with it . "
BOEHNER : Well , I think we have a world class facility at Guantanamo .
I think it 's the appropriate -- appropriate place to hold these prisoners .
And they can do the -- the tribunals right there at Guantanamo .
There is no reason to bring these terrorists into the United States .
No reason to increase the threat level here , because they 're here .
Their friends may want to come .
It makes no sense to me .
And I do n't think the Congress will appropriate one dime to move those prisoners from Guantanamo to the United States .
This is offered to the world in the spirit of “ If other programmers can learn from my mistakes , maybe my threads wo n’t have died in vain . ”
The trouble is , I do n’t think anyone will ever find this by Googling .
Maybe I am wrong .
Here is a heavily - sanitised snippet of Python code , sitting inside a loop , being run by a pool of threads .
start_time = datetime.now ( ) if start_time >= next_run_due : logging .debug ( " Starting the performance - critical section " ) #
Ensure that the results we send are based on the freshest data .
fetch_data ( ) #
Have noticed this runs slow sometimes .
Keep an eye on it . fetch_completed_time = datetime.now ( ) #
Do n't examine now .
Wait until outside performance - critical section ! process_data( ) send_results ( ) # Relax .
Now outside the performance - critical section .
#
This performance check has been placed outside the performance - critical section , because logging.critical ( ) may send a ( slow ) email .
if fetch_completed_time - start_time > threshold : logging.critical ( " Fetch time is running slow again . " )
# Implicitly sends an email .
#
If you see this message , check the network and CPU are n't congested .
next_run_due = next_due_date ( )
So this code checks if some processing is due , and if so , fetchs the data , processes it and sends out the results .
It tries to make sure that when it sends out results , it is based on the freshest possible data , so the key section does as little extraneous work as possible .
Sometimes , the data - fetch takes longer than expected – historically , that has been because something else on the server is chewing up more resources that it should .
I want to know when that happens , so I can go and fix it , so I log a critical message .
The critical message log is linked to send an SMTP message with Python ’s logging library ’s SMTPHandler .
I do this check outside the key section , so processing the email does n’t ( further ) slow the sending of the results .
Can you see the problem with this code ?
I could n’t .
( I love asking this question , because people tend to find dozens of other problems I never thought about ! )
Sure , there is no throttling on the critical messages , but that is because this does n’t occur frequently enough to cause email flooding .
Here ’s a hint .
Multi - threading and locking .
Some code , in some thread , somewhere , called logging.critical ( ) . Logging.critical ( ) tried to send an email .
I expected logging.critical ( ) to write the email to a local buffer , and for sendmail ( or whatever ) to pick it up and deliver it later .
I knew it would be slow , but I was expecting sub - second response times .
I have n’t worked out why that is n’t always true , but it is n’t always true .
It can take many seconds to send this email .
But that ’s okay , because there are no logging .critical ( ) calls during any performance - sensitive areas , so it wo n’t affect the “ freshness ” or the data which is really the critical performance characteristic .
Can you see the call to logging .
debug ( ) ?
It does not send an email ; it writes to a log file .
Its execution time is measured in hundreds of microseconds , so it is n’t a concern .
Or so I thought .
It turns out that logging . debug ( ) blocks , waiting for the logging .critical ( ) call to complete .
Now the debug message is taking 10,000 times longer than it normally does !
It still is n’t inside the critical part , but note that it is inside the part that is timed .
So when fetching + logging it takes more time than the threshold , out goes another logging .critical ( ) call , which is another email message , which is another blocked logging system , which holds up the next thread , and so it goes .
Meanwhile , the time taken to do a logging .critical ( ) call is increasing as they all wait in queue to send emails .
The first one goes out , as expected , in less than a second .
The second one took twice as long .
The third , three times as long .
It got to the stage that my threads were freezing up for 90 seconds .
I said before that there were n’t enough of these calls to cause email flooding .
I stand by that – there was a burst of few hundred over a couple hours which should be easily handled by a server ’s email system .
But that is assuming that all the threads in the system are not waiting for every email to actually reach its destination before they continue .
Short Term Solution
I ’ve turned off emailing of critical logs for the time being .
I have moved the debug log outside of the timed section , to stop it from propagating the problem , in any case .
Outstanding Questions
Before I can implement a long - term solution , I have to understand some issues .
Is my MTA running too slowly , even though it is on the localhost ?
Could it be making me wait while it sends the email , rather than buffering and sending it later ?
Could it be protecting itself from elephant - interferers err .. spammers by deliberately running slowly ?
Or is it inappropriate for me ( and SMTPHandler ) to have every thought it should be fast enough ?
Does SMTPHandler buffer emails before sending them out in a different thread ?
Apparently not .
Could it be configured or rewritten to do so ?
Do I really need to write such a beast myself ?
Could BufferingSMTPHandler help ?
It seems to try to minimise emails sent by chunking them and only sending when the buffer is full .
Presumably , it still blocks other logging during this occasional email , so it remains a problem .
Could SysLogHandler help by taking it out of the domain of Python ?
Or given my limited experience with syslog , will I just have a new set of problems ?
In the meantime , if you use SMTPHandler , and you get random periods of sustained bad performance , maybe this will help you ?
Do the Euro fuel economy reqs for automakers work like they do here , where you average it out over the entire product line ?
Ca n't they keep making gas guzzlers as long as they add a few sippers to the lineup ?
Maybe Audi can sell some econo - diesel - hybrids to make up for the V12's .
It 's official : Megan
Fox is merely the second most sexy woman in the world , according to FHM 's annual analysis of just who its readers consider the pick of international females .
For the second year running , the Transformers " actress " must bow to Girls Aloud warbler Cheryl Cole , as must Victoria 's Secret model Marisa Miller , who secured third spot .
Bob , this is Megan .
Book me a Cheryl Cole makeover , like right now
Trailing this trio of desirables were Frankie Sandford of girl band The Saturdays , Brit model Keeley Hazell and Twilight star Kristen Stewart .
Seventh place went to Kelly Brook , followed in close order by Adriana Lima , Jessica Alba and footballer Peter Crouch 's squeeze Abbey Clancy , who round off the top ten .
FHM explains that Ms Cole " simply left the competition standing in their stilettos , coughing in her sexy dust " in this year 's vote .
Her winning credentials include " the body , the eyes , the legs , the cheekbones , the hair , that criminally underexposed cleavage " , coupled to her " dominance of TV , magazines and websites across the planet " and the ability to " lose 150 pounds of useless flab " - a nice description of former hubby Ashley Cole . ®
Readers may remember a couple of weeks back when I lamented that the downward economy had finally caught up to me and my little weather business .
I asked readers if they ’d mind if I ’d showcase a weather station or two to help drum up some business .
Nobody objected and many readers were very helpful and sympathetic .
Thank you sincerely .
I always like to find ways to bring meteorological and climate science to the layman , hence this blog .
My specialty is instrumentation , and readers may recall back in fall 2008 when I rigged up my vehicle with an NIST calibrated data logger , window mounted Gill IR shield , and a live connection to my laptop and drove a transect to measure the surface temperature .
The result was this first ever graph of Reno ’s UHI ( Urban Heat Island ) signature :
Click for larger image
That little experiment garnered quite a few comments , and I always wanted to find an inexpensive way for others to recreate what I did without having to invest in a high priced NIST calibrated probe , IR shield , datalogger , and laptop , all told which would run about $ 1200 .
That ’s beyond the means of many people who might take an interest .
It ’s also well beyond the means of most students who might want to do something like this for their local science fair in their own hometown .
I ’m pleased to say I have devised a solution for about 1/10th the cost , and I ’ve just finished testing it in my hometown of Chico , CA .
The results follow .
As many readers know , I sell some nifty USB dataloggers , and you may have seen this ad on the right sidebar which links to my online store .
The dataloggers are inexpensive , mostly under $ 100 , and work great for various monitoring applications where you want to gather and evaluate temperature data .
Problem is , they had no way to be mounted to anything easily , and I could n’t see an easy way to mount one to a vehicle like I did with the IR Gill shield :
The NIST calibrated temperature sensor ( inside the Gill IR shield ) mounted on the vehicle using an improvised window mount . , Cable goes to datalogger inside , and datalogger connected to laptop .
My goal has always been to recreate this inexpensively and reliably so many of you could map UHI in your own city .
Making this within reach of students and their parents was the ultimate goal .
How does $ 84.95 sound compared to $ 1200 ?
You do n’t even need to take a laptop in the vehicle with you .
Some days , serendipity strikes .
A discussion about US flags with fellow blogger Russ Steele made me think about this idea of using the window flag mounts commonly seen en-route to football and baseball games :
Except my version has no team flag , it flies a datalogger instead :
How ’s that for simple ?
I spent today working this product idea out and testing it to make sure it is simple enough for anyone to recreate anywhere .
Then I ran some road tests .
Here ’s how it works .
First we start with the USB - 2 Temperature and Humidity datalogger .
The reason I chose this unit over a temperature - only USB - 1 version is that it already has a built in mini IR shield that allows free airflow .
It reacts faster for that reason .
Next I provide a modified vehicle window mount and mounting hardware specifically to keep the USB - 2 datalogger affixed , click images to enlarge :
Adhesive Velcro strip plus a removable secure strap worked best :
I ran some tests to see if I could fling the datalogger off the end .
It held even after inflicting a few G’s on it at arms length .
Here ’s the finished product :
The next test was to see if the datalogger was far enough out of the vehicle slipstream to prevent any temperature contamination while moving .
That was evident from the data right away .
I did four daytime driving transects of my town to see if there were any hiccups or gotchas with install , driving , removal , and data download .
Finding none , I wrote up some instructions :
Measuring UHI in your city :
Install the software on your Windows PC ( or laptop if you bring it with you in the car ) .
Experiment with and familiarize yourself with the datalogger .
Choose a route you can drive in your town that provides a good north - south and / or east - west driving transect from country , through suburbs , downtown , and back to countryside again .
Use Google Earth or a similar mapping tool to assist in planning your route .
Try to choose a route that will not take any more than 30 minutes to minimize ambient temperature change that may occur .
Choose a clear night with no wind or light wind if possible .
Later at night like 11 PM - midnight is best so as to have minimum traffic and stoplights .
Set the data logger to start logging either immediately or at some start time in the future .
Put the waterproof cap back on Affix the datalogger to the vehicle mount using the strap provided .
Put the vehicle mount on the top edge of your vehicle window and close it for a tight fit .
Drive to the start point , Either wait for the pre-programmed start time or trigger the data logger to start from your laptop .
It is always best to start on an easy to check period like top of the hour , quarter hour , or half hour .
Drive the route , trying to maintain a fixed speed .
Have your passenger note landmarks / locations in a logbook as you drive so that you can correlate with temperatures later .
Optional – take a logging GPS unit with you if you want exact positions and time .
Once completing the first transect , turn around and drive it again .
You may wish to do several transects if time allows so that you can create an average profile later .
Remove the USB - 2 datalogger from the vehicle mount , plug into your PC , launch the included software and plot your results !
Export the data to a spreadsheet for further analysis .
Saturday night , April 3rd , I ran my first for real UHI transect on Highway 99 from Garner Lane North of town to Neal Road South of town .
I chose these points because they were safe places to turnaround and because they were both well enough removed from the population center that I expected they would approximate “ rural ” conditions .
After driving a transect and reverse driving it again , here is what the datalogger showed from the program that ships with the datalogger :
As you can see , the red temperature curve shows two humps , these are the two transects mirrored .
First one was driving NW to SE , and the reverse ( second ) was SE to NW .
Humidity and dewpoint are also displayed .
The temperature looks a little blocky becuase the resolution of the datalogger is 0.5 °C .
However , given the world ’s surface data is measured to the nearest degree , this is more than adequate for the purpose .
My home weather station ( in town ) showed light winds less than 5mph from the southeast and 50 °F ( 10 °C ) when I left .
Skies were clear .
It was a good evening to measure UHI .
I took a voice recorder with me to note the time I started driving and the time I turned around and reversed the transect .
I drove the reverse transect about 10 mph faster because the first transect I did n’t want to pass a semi truck ( speed limit 55 mph for trucks through town ) and pick up any waste heat , so I held well behind it .
Next I exported that data into my favorite graphing program ( DPlot ) and edited the starting and ending data times based on my recorder notes .
I had set the datalogger at home to automatically start at 8:45 PM and I had n’t reached my Garner lane start point yet .
My actual transect began at 8:47 PM from Garner Lane at Highway 99 intersection .
Then I pulled up my Google Earth and started exporting some images for reference .
Here ’s the normal map view of the transect with starting and ending points :
And here ’s the NW to SE driving transect overlaid onto a Google Earth 3D image looking NE so that Highway 99 appears as a “ x - axis ” :
As you can see , the graph matches the infrastructure character of the town fairly well , with the peak coinciding with the center of town ( marked by the crosshair and label ) .
The temperature is less in the rural outskirts of town .
So there we have it , it appears that my small college town of ~ 80,000 people has a UHI value of about 1.5 °C ( 2.7 °F ) via this transect .
The second return transect from SE to NW has the same magnitude , but is offset due to ambient temperature drop that occurred during the drive .
When I returned home at 9:30 PM , and hour later my home weather station had dropped to 44°F .
So would you like to do this for your hometown ?
Do you have a son / daughter nephew / niece that would benefit from a weekend science project learning about how to measure temperature and graph it to show UHI ?
Or , maybe you just want to do it yourself for fun and quantify what you ’ve noticed for years via your automobile thermometer .
I ’ll be happy to post any results here .
The only real caveat to this experiment is : do n’t stop your vehicle if you can help it .
Without a constant airstream , some waste heat from the vehicle might make its way to the sensor .
Choose your driving route to avoid long stoplights , and I ’ve found that in many cities after 11 PM certain thoroughfares are “ greenlighted ” .
If you like this little idea or know somebody who would , please feel free to buy my little UHI measurement kit at a price most anyone can afford : $ 84.95
It helps me and provides more data that shows UHI to be a real , measurable , effect .
Here is the link to purchase the kit : http://weathershop.com/usb2-UHI.htm
And yes , I do ship internationally .
Thanks for your consideration , happy motoring !

UPDATE : Hu McCulloch reminds me of the similar experiment Warren Meyer and his son did a couple of years ago which you can read about here :
http://www.climate-skeptic.com/2008/02/measureing-the.html
Some commenters were concerned about contamination of the data due to the vehicle .
This is possible , even likely , at a dead stop .
But at highway speeds of 60 mph or even street speeds of 30 mph any such contamination gets swept away in the slipstream .
Essentially the thermometer has turbocharged aspiration , and is measuring the true temperature of the air being intersected .
There may be issues with wast heat from vehicles ahead , but if you drive carefully and avoid tailgating , this can be avoided .
Doing multiple transsects over time and averagign the runs is another way to minimize such biases .

The state of California ’s real unfunded pension debt clocks in at more than $ 500 billion , nearly eight times greater than officially reported .
That ’s the finding from a study released Monday by Stanford University ’s public policy program , confirming a recent report with similar , stunning findings from Northwestern University and the University of Chicago .
To put that number in perspective , it ’s almost seven times greater than all the outstanding voter - approved state general obligation bonds in California .
Why should Californians care ?
Because this year ’s unfunded pension liability is next year ’s budget cut to important programs .
For a glimpse of California ’s budgetary future , look no further than the $ 5.5 billion diverted this year from higher education , transit , parks and other programs in order to pay just a tiny bit toward current unfunded pension and healthcare promises .
That figure is set to triple within 10 years and -- absent reform -- to continue to grow , crowding out funding for many programs vital to the overwhelming majority of Californians .

How did we get here ?
The answer is simple : For decades -- and without voter consent -- state leaders have been issuing billions of dollars of debt in the form of unfunded pension and healthcare promises , then gaming accounting rules in order to understate the size of those promises .
As we saw during the recent financial crisis , hiding debt is not a new phenomenon .
Indeed , General Motors did something similar to obscure the true cost of its retirement promises .
Through aggressive accounting , for a while it , too , got away with making pension contributions that were a fraction of what it really needed to make , thereby reporting better earnings than was truly the case .
But eventually the pension promises come due , and for GM , that meant having to add extra costs to its cars , making its prices less attractive to consumers and contributing to its eventual bankruptcy .
In California ’s case , past pension underfunding means reduced funding of current programs .
This explains why pension costs rose 2,000 % from 1999 to 2009 , while state funding for higher education declined over the same period .

What can we do about this ?
For the promises already made , nothing .
They are contractual , and because that $ 500 billion of debt must be paid , retirement costs will rise dramatically no matter what we do .
But we can reduce the sizes of promises made to new employees and require full and truthful disclosure so that pension debt can never again be hidden .
Last summer Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed exactly that .
Since then ?
Silence .
State legislators are afraid even to utter the words “ pension reform ” for fear of alienating what has become -- since passage of the Dills Act in 1978 , which endowed state public employees with collective bargaining rights on top of their civil service protections -- the single most politically influential constituency in our state : government employees .
Because legislators are unwilling to raise issues that might offend that constituency , they have effectively turned the peroration of Abraham Lincoln ’s Gettysburg Address on its head : Instead of a government of the people , by the people and for the people , we have become a government of its employees , by its employees and for its employees .
This explains why legislators fight harder to overturn employee furloughs than to reform pensions and elect to pay more in compensation to just 65,000 employees in one single department -- corrections -- than they spend on a higher education system serving 10 times as many people .

Simply put , the single most important step a legislator can take to protect programs and taxpayers is to embrace pension reform .
There is no structural impediment to pension reform , and no initiative has forced legislators to issue all that pension debt .
All of the damage has been caused by legislation , most notoriously SB 400 in 1999 , which retroactively and prospectively boosted pension promises by billions of dollars without boosting contributions .
Likewise , all the remediation can be accomplished by legislation .
Even the state legislature of Illinois -- a legendary poster state for pension misbehavior -- has now passed pension reform .
There ’s no reason the California Legislature cannot do the same .
Call or write your legislator about pension reform , and while you ’re at it , remind him or her that we are indeed a government of the people , by the people and for the people .

Finally got the opportunity to set my own eyes upon the startlingly beautiful , museum - quality South Florida Hockey Den of Honor , located - generally - behind section 118 at BankAtlantic Center .
For a franchise with a scant 17 seasons of history - and little on - ice success over that period - the " DOH " paints a far more eclectic light on the club and its tremendous value to South Florida 's growing hockey footprint , especially among high schools and local tournaments .
Both are well represented via gorgeous trophy displays and a gaggle of sweaters .
There 's so much to absorb , and so finely crafted , that the overwhelming impression is not " I can't believe they did it " , but " I ca n't believe they did it so well " .
A few thoughts and photos after the jump ...
Not to say the area - which spans an enormous five seating sections - wipes out the darker moments of the club 's history simply by existing , only that a newfound respect for the franchise , and its roots , can be found behind all of that glass .
I 'll spare you a relic - by - relic punch - list of everything on display ; much of that can be found around the net in abundance .
My thoughts ?
I really enjoyed seeing the ancient Miami Herald and Sun-Sentinel articles from Year One ( many of which I still personally have , though they have taken on a rather saddening Dead Sea Scroll - ish appearance ) .
Could have spent a lot more time in this area soaking in the printed history .
Wayne Huizenga , Bill Torrey , and Bobby Clarke abound .
For those of us " first fans " , it 's a goldmine reliving this stuff .
Glass casements containing equipment spanning the ages : Vanbiesbrouck .
Luongo .
Jovanovski .
And many others .
The " battle " between the cities of Fort Lauderdale and Sunrise over the then - future home of the Panthers .
The first draft .
The expansion draft .
A physical rundown of Florida 's jerseys .
Video displays seemingly everywhere , running loops of the great moments burned into so many of our heads .
Oh , and unsuspecting Holy Grail of South Florida hockey : rats .
Lots of rats .
Without question , paying homage to the 1995 - 96 season is the toast of the collection .
But wisely , it does not dominate .
Few fans of the sport outside the Panthers ' realm can easily fathom why that year means so very much .
A few minutes in this section spells it out clearly .
A couple of quickie pics I found to be immensely fascinating , historically - speaking :

Colorado Springs in the 1970s : Ron Stallworth
By William Murchison - April 14 , 2010
A congressional proponent of the nation 's first federal income tax law , enacted in 1894 , was , to say the least , beside himself over the wonders he and his colleagues had wrought .
" The passage of this bill , " burbled Congressman David Albaugh DeArmond , " will mark the dawn of a brighter day , with more of sunshine , more of the songs of birds , more of that sweetest music , the laughter of children well fed , well clothed , well housed . "
It was no doubt a nice thought .
The U.S. Supreme Court swatted down the law as unconstitutional , and a 16th Amendment had to be hemmed to the constitutional fabric to make possible the bird songs , the sweet music , etc .
In 2010 , Income Tax Day finds Americans wondering , as is customary on Income Tax Day , whether we 'll ever get right the dratted business of taxing incomes instead of goods .
From the Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution comes word that just 53 percent of us are paying federal income taxes now .
The rest ?
Exempted on account of low incomes , credits or deductions .
A family of four , with two children under age 17 , and an annual income of $ 50,000 might owe no income tax whatever .
Not that these Americans do n't pay taxes , because they do -- Social Security , Medicare , gasoline , alcohol , and so on .
They just do n't pay income tax .
It creates a problem .
If you do n't pay income tax , your sympathy for those who do pay it probably is n't large .
You 're apt to wonder , indeed , why they can't pay more , especially as your own needs increase .
When enough start wondering , congressional ears prick up .
Observe one more reason why the American economy is under such stress .
It always happens when labor and rewards are proportioned unequally by the authorities .
The 20th chapter of Matthew comes to mind :
When the laborers who ( in Jesus ' parable ) had agreed early to work for a penny a day saw others hiring on later at the same rate , " they murmured against the goodman of the house , " who informed them that " the last shall be first , and the first last ; for many be called , but few chosen . "
Flawless theology , I 'm sure .
Not a convincing formula , you have to admit , when it comes to civic peace .
Already the top 10 percent of Americans pay 73 percent of federal income tax .
What to do at time of crippling deficits ?
Load more burdens on them ?
Hope that , like the carthorse in " Animal Farm , " they will reply with one voice , " I will do more " ?
The whole theory of the income tax is that those best able to pay it , pay it .
It sounds halfway sensible until one starts to reckon with human notions of justice ( " to each his own " ) and the disruptive implications of upsetting those notions by government edict .
A nation , half of whose citizens do n't pay income taxes , is in a bad position to say fewer and fewer should toil for the support of more and more .
Yet the spending and deficits rise like Roman candles .
Comes now ObamaCare , to be paid for , in part , by the same " wealthy " people who already pay most of the taxes and will certainly seek legal ways to avoid paying more .
Recently , former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker indicated where this dispute might be going .
Toward a European - style value - added tax , he said -- a tax levied on an item at every stage of production .
" If at the end of the day we need to raise taxes , " said Volcker , " we should raise taxes . "
On top of what we 're paying now in income tax ?
That sounds like fun .
Americans sense that their eyes are bigger , politically speaking , than their stomachs .
They urgently need to debate how many government programs they really want to pay for , as concentrated with how many they just plain want .
It 's hardly the debate the administration that just seized control of health care wants to encourage .
But the sooner it begins , the better for all -- the rich , the poor , the in - between .
As Rachel explains , the payday lending business , or what we used to call loan sharks , is fighting against any new regulations .
As she noted , the mega-rich Check Into Cash CEO is one of those fighting against the industry being regulated at all .
TPM has more -- High - Living Pay - Day Lender CEO Tied To Bid To Weaken Financial Reform :
In the wake of the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression , a high - living , politically connected Tennessee businessman who made a fortune by lending money to the poor at sky - high interest rates has ties to a successful effort to water down financial regulatory reform .
Meet W. Allan Jones , who in 1993 founded Check Into Cash , a pay - day lending chain that says it now has 1,100 stores in 30 states .
The company offers short - term loans designed to tide customers over until their next paycheck .
But the interest rates can be as much as 400 percent on an annualized basis , meaning that they lead many borrowers to end up digging themselves deeper into debt .
... The business has been good to Jones , 56 , however .
In 2005 , a Tennessee business magazine put his net worth at $ 500 million -- high enough to put him on a list of the state 's richest 20 people , alongside FedEx founder Fred Smith and Thomas Frist Jr. , the hospital entrepreneur and father of former Senate leader Bill Frist .
And Jones has n't been shy about displaying that fortune .
According to the magazine , Jones 's 400 - acre home boasts an air - conditioned muscle car garage , which includes a $ 300,000 Maybach ; an on - site greenhouse with a full - time horticulturist ; a three - story tree house ; and -- get this -- a regulation - sized football field with lights , a scoreboard and supporting field house and stand , which he used to host the first - ever private college football game , raising $ 100,000 for University of Tennessee - Chattanooga .
... All of this would n't amount to much more than a rather severe lapse in taste ( although we admit the three - story tree - house sounds cool ) were it not for recent events in the U.S. Senate .
There , Corker reportedly has weakened the section of the major financial regulatory reform bill that deals with pay - day lenders .
Thanks to Corker , who sits on the Senate Banking committee , the new CFPA will have to get permission from a body of regulators in order to enforce rules against payday lenders and other non-bank financial companies -- a step that consumer groups say will significantly hamstring the agency 's ability to crack down on predatory lending practices .
Read on ...
Check For Cash founder Jones started a new blog and as Rachel noted , tried to downplay just how much money his industry makes .
" Is a store that earns $ 8.96 for each hour they are open ' raking it in ? '
Believe it not , some elitist people and the mainstream media think so , " Mr. Jones writes in his first blog posted Wednesday ....
" It 's hard to feel like a predatory lender when you make about the same wage as the average employee at Burger King a company which , by the way , netted $ 200 million last year .
Whoppers are clearly more profitable than payday loans , " Mr. Jones writes .
Yeah , that elitist mainstream media from poor little old Allan Jones -- Tennessee Business Magazine :
W. Allan Jones Source of Wealth : Check Cashing * $ 500 Million Cleveland Jones is the founder of the payday advance industry ( see previous story ) .
His 400 - acre home site in Cleveland has an air - conditioned muscle car garage highlighted by his $ 300,000 Maybach ; an on - site greenhouse with a full - time horticulturist ; a three - story tree house ; and a regulation - sized football field with lights , a scoreboard and supporting field house and stands .
Jones hosted the country ’s first - ever private college football game , raising $ 100,000 for University of Tennessee - Chattanooga .
Jones owns and operates the Crescent H Ranch , a 233 - acre commercial dude ranch and western lodge in Jackson Hole , Wyo. , home to seven miles of spring creeks , ponds and the Snake River — a fisherman ’s paradise .
In all , Jones owns 433 acres in Jackson Hole .
In the shadows of the Teton Range , it borders 1,300 acres of national forest .
He bought it at auction in 2000 for $ 12.3 million , but its value has shot through the roof since .
The seller ?
Fellow Tennessean John “ Thunder ” Thornton , who paid $ 52 million for a much larger parcel in 1997 , then sold several multi-million dollar lots .
After his 136 - foot Mefasa yacht previously owned by King Juan Carlos of Spain burned in a fire near Palm Beach , Jones bought a 157 - foot boat , named after his wife , Janie , that was under construction for NASCAR racing kingpin Rick Hendrick .
Its estimated price tag is $ 24 million .
The boat has a 61 - inch plasma television in the lounge .
In the pilothouse are nine additional televisions on nine satellite receivers for thorough tracking of Saturday college football games .
It ’s available for charter for $ 175,000 per week ( $ 25,000 a day ) .
Jones expects to make $ 1 million leasing the boat this summer alone .
Racecar driver Jimmie Johnson honeymooned on it .
This May , the boat was in Monaco hosting wealthy Russians attending the Grand Prix .
It later docked at the Cannes film festival .
For use in his businesses , Jones owns two planes , a Challenger 600 ( $ 5 million ) and a Citation V Ultra ( $ 4 million ) .
He ’s about to buy a third , rumored to be a new “ Global Express , ” considered the ultimate corporate jet , with a price tag around $ 40 million .
As Rachel noted , Sen . Kay Hagan has introduced a bill to protect consumers from predatory lenders -- HAGAN INTRODUCES BILL TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM PREDATORY PAYDAY LOANS :
FOR the first time in two years , many job seekers may have reason to feel hopeful .
Employers are beginning to hire again — or at least think about it .
Although the unemployment rate remained at 9.7 percent in March , and many economists expect the rate to stay high for some time , there are now some very positive signs .
And they go well beyond other government figures showing that employers added 162,000 nonfarm jobs for the month .
The shift is most apparent in job postings , which have begun to surge .
Indeed.com , which collects job listings from thousands of sources , reported a 19 percent increase in postings in March , versus the same month last year .
The number of postings rose in 10 of 12 industry categories .
( The only category that declined was health care , one of the few bright spots during the recession . )
The industries that showed the biggest uptick in March openings were retail , up 42 percent ; hospitality , 33 percent ; and media and newspapers , 30 percent .

Kept in secret until yesterday , a newly appeared company , named SiOnyx , unveils an invention of some Harvard researchers , that is going to revolutionize the whole industry .
Harvard has been studying their “ black silicon ” for almost ten years , but nothing has come out of their lab , due to internal policies regarding the output of their discoveries to commercial companies .
Now , SiOnyx has the exclusive rights to commercialize the invention .
So , what is that “ black silicon ” and where did they get it from ?
You may imagine black silicon as being a black piece of silicon , because it is .
It practically absorbs all the light coming onto it , including infrared .
Ten years ago , by mistake , scientists focused a powerful and short ( in lengths of femtoseconds ) laser beam to a silicon wafer and got it black .
Then , they analyzed the silicon wafer with the microscope and they found nanometric - scale spikes , like in the picture above .
To the whole experiment they added sulphur hexafluoride .
The effects of this “ fried ” silicon were a sky rocketing light sensitivity , somewhere between 100 and 500 times more sensitive than the ordinary ones .
It even detects infrared light , by an effect still not understood by scientists .
Of course , the discovery scared everybody and nothing has been unveiled until today .
Now SiOnyx is going to manufacture and license hardware upgrades for the silicon processing factories , that they say will implement the new technology very cheaply and easily , adding it to the old one without many modifications to their technological process .
The black silicon will be used in manufacturing high efficiency solar panels with 1600W per square meter , high sensitivity imaging sensors , and others .
I do n’t know why , but I have a feeling that the US army is not foreign to this technology since ten years ago …
A press release from SiOnyx will come today and possibly offer more details of their future products .

We profiled Google 's Data Liberation Front when the initiative was first made public last year , but what has Google 's in - house data export team been up to since ?
Designing stickers , for one thing .
" CAGE FREE DATA , " they proclaim , which sums up the Data Liberation Front 's efforts succinctly .
The team 's goal is nothing less than to make it simple for people to leave Google 's many services , taking e-mails , photos , and documents along with them .
Its most recent work has been on Google Docs , which now sports a batch download option .
Select the documents you want , click a button , and Google will zip them all into one compressed archive of up to 2GB and mail them to you .
On a recent visit to Google 's Chicago office , where the DLF team is based , we sat down with team leader Brian Fitzpatrick to talk more about how and why he wants to make it easy for people to abandon Google 's services .
Stopping stagnation
Certainly there 's PR value in hosting such a " not evil " initiative within the company , but DLF did n't begin life as a top - down project .
Fitzpatrick says it " started off as naïveté " on his part ; after listening to company president Eric Schmidt wax eloquent for years on the virtues of not locking users in , Fitzpatrick noted that not all of Google 's products made this easy .
DLF was the result of his work .
The team has been together for two years now , and although it began by seeking out other engineering teams , Fitzpatrick says that those teams are " now coming to us " to ask how they 're doing .
Data lock - in is n't bad just for users ; Fitzpatrick argues that it 's also bad for Google .
" If you create a user base that 's locked in , " he says , " there 's no way you 're not going to become complacent . "
Making it as easy to leave Google Docs as to leave the Google search engine plays to one of Google 's strengths : hiring really smart people .
DLF 's work " sets that fire under an engineering team , " Fitzpatrick says , since the engineers need to keep users happy through innovation , not lock - in .
The DLF sticker
Do people actually care about liberating their data ?
Some do , but usage of the export features remains low .
Google sees a " continuous low - level of use of these things , " said one engineer on the team , especially when it chooses to shut down underperforming services .
Having export tools actually makes it easier to do such shutdowns , too ; recall that DRM - laden music stores ran into problems when they eventually tried to shut down their DRM servers .
Google 's data openness helps the company avoid this sort of public criticism in the event of service shutdowns , as when the company closed its Google Notebook product .
Nicole Wong , Google 's Deputy General Counsel , told us separately that DLF matters to Google for two reasons : 1 ) it provides control to users and 2 ) " when we say our competition is one click away , " initiatives like DLF prove that it 's true .
This last comment is a reminder that openness does have real strategic benefits for the company that go beyond engineering and user empowerment .
Google is increasingly under antitrust scrutiny by a more aggressive Department of Justice in the US , and it 's already fending off antitrust investigations in Europe .
DLF is one more part of the argument that Google is not a gatekeeper .
The DLF team does face occasional criticism that Google 's products are " open " only to exporting material of less value to Google ( see this comment from researcher Ben Edelman on getting data out of AdWords , for instance ) .
But DLF has now worked with more than 25 teams at Google to make data export easier , and its efforts on products like Google Docs are certainly good news for users .
" We try to raise awareness within the company , " said Fitzpatrick , though he admitted with a grin that he has no " authority " to make anyone do anything .
There 's always more to do .
The team does monitor a Google Moderator page where users can make suggestions — and there are plenty .
" Gmail contacts — being able to export them and reimport an edited version , without duplicating every single one , " says one idea .
" Add hCalendar microformats to Google Calendar , so that events can be reused elsewhere , " says another .
" Let me get my Chat history from gMail , " says a third .
Fitzpatrick promises that more is coming , though he can't talk about projects in the pipeline .
What he can do , though , is mail you a sticker .
The new series of Doctor Who has Twilight and Harry Potter - like elements to it , the executive producers have revealed .
Speaking to Doctor Who Magazine , Piers Wenger - who is working alongside fellow execs Steven Moffat and Beth Willis for series five - said that they wanted it to have a " fairy - tale feel " .
" We just wanted to make the show look as up - to - date as it possibly could , " Wenger explained .
" One of the qualities in Steven 's writing , and one of Steven 's natural tendencies as a writer , is to write these strange , dark , glittering fairy tales .
" We wanted to give the look of the series a slightly more storybook , fairy - tale feel - within reason . "
He added : " It was n't about suddenly becoming Tim Burton , but it was finding a pinch of that , a pinch of Twilight , a pinch of Harry Potter - but it 's still absolutely , slap - bang , mainstream Doctor Who .

MEDVEDEV APPRECIATES
A ‘THINKER ’ IN THE OVAL OFFICE ….
ABC ’s George Stephanopoulos interviewed Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in St. Petersburg on Friday , the day after he joined President Obama in Prague to sign a new nuclear arms treaty .
The interview , portions of which were aired this morning on “ Good Morning America , ” prompted some interesting exchanges .
( Stephanopoulos did not ask Medvedev to respond to any Sarah Palin quotes . )
The transcript is well worth reading , but with an eye towards U.S. politics , these remarks stood out .
( video via ThinkProgress )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You ’ve now met with President Obama many times .
At least 15 meetings and phone calls .
MEDVEDEV : Sixteen times .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Sixteen .
Okay , I knew it was 15 .
I was n’t sure about the 16 .
What do you make of Barack Obama the man ?
MEDVEDEV : He ’s very comfortable partner , it ’s very interesting to be with him .
The most important thing that distinguishes him from many other people — I wo n’t name anyone by name — he ’s a thinker , he thinks when he speaks .
Which is already pretty good .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You had somebody in your mind , I think .
( LAUGHS ) MEDVEDEV : Obviously I do have someone on my mind .
I do n’t want to offend anyone .
He ’s eager to listen to his partner , which is a pretty good quality for a politician .
Because any politician is to a certain degree a mentor .
They preach something .
And the ability to listen to their partner is very important for the politician .
And he is pretty deeply immersed in the subject , so he has a good knowledge of what he ’s talking about .
There was no instance in our meetings with Mr. Obama where he was n’t well prepared for the questions .
This is very good .
And after all , he ’s simply a very pleasant man with whom it ’s a pleasure to deal with .
It ’s easy to forget sometimes , but it is awfully heartening to again have a U.S. leader who commands respect on the international stage .

Hi everyone ,
It is my great pleasure to announce that rock 0.9.0 went out yesterday night , with binary builds for 32 and 64bit linux , 32 bit windows , and 64bit OSX .
A few days ago , we bootstrapped < http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)>, which means that - rock is now distributed as C source - building rock is as simple as grabbing the C source < http://github.com/downloads/nddrylliog/rock/rock-0.9.0-source.tar.bz2>, extract , type ' make ' .
That 's it .
No dependencies .
No hassle .
- rock is written in ooc < http://docs.ooc-lang.org/>, and it compiles itself !
- j/ooc < http://github.com/nddrylliog/ooc> is meant to die ( unless someone really wants to maintain it )
We 're very excited to present you this release , packed with awesome : - interfaces < http://github.com/nddrylliog/bootcamp/tree/master/source/interfaces>have been implemented , so that this compiles fine : Representable : interface { toString : func ->
String } Dog : class implements
Representable { growl : func {} toString : func ->
String { " Dog ! " } run : func {} } Cat : class implements Representable { meowl : func {} beLazy : func {} toString : func ->
String { " Cat ! " } } main : func { print ( Dog new ( ) ) print ( Cat new ( ) ) } print : func ( r : Representable ) { r toString ( ) println ( ) } - we now have real closures < http://github.com/nddrylliog/bootcamp/tree/master/source/closures>, that capture context , thanks to yaijt < http://github.com/nddrylliog/yajit>: import os / Env main : func { msg := " Pleased to meet you " name := Env get ( " USER " ) atexit ( func { " %s , %s " format ( msg , name ) println ( ) } ) } - a powerful enums syntax < http://github.com/nddrylliog/bootcamp/tree/master/source/enums>, that plays well with C and is incredibly pleasurable to use , e.g. : Colors : enum { red , green , blue } main : func { blue :=
Colors blue " Blue 's value is %d " format ( blue ) println ( ) } - but also : Multiples : enum ( * 2 ) { x=1 , y , z } Sums : enum ( +4 ) { a , b , c } main : func { " x= %d y= %d z= % d " format ( Multiples x , Multiples y , Multiples z ) println ( ) " a= %d b= %d c= %d " format ( Sums a , Sums b , Sums c ) println ( ) } - .. and many more features , for example , helpful error messages : helpful.ooc:3:12 ERROR
No such function FileReaderClass.new ( String , Char ) FileReader new ( " / etc/hosts " , 'r ' ) ^^^ Nearest match is : FileReader.new~withMode : static func ( fileName : String , mode : String ) ->
FileReader .. but the type of this arg should be String , not Char FileReader new ( " / etc/hosts " , 'r ' ) ^ [ FAIL ]
We 've been working hard to deliver you the very best of our git repos .
All our code lives on GitHub < http://github.com/languages/ooc>, and most of it is BSD or friendlier .
Please fill our bug tracker < http://github.com/nddrylliog/rock/issues>, suggest ideas on the mailing list < https://launchpad.net/~ooc-dev>
or our IRC channel ( #ooc - lang on Freenode ) Our docs < http://docs.ooc-lang.org/> are still looking a bit bare at the moment - any help is greatly appreciated !
Enjoy the fresh release , and spread the word if you like it !

I suppose it is still theoretically possible that last
Thurs is the top - the drop from which started before the " Sue Goldman " story broke , indicating it was driven by technicals not news .
( I find the market in the short run almost always technical , with occasional jinks and ives from news that do not last very long - as the bounce from Sue Goldman clearly shows ! )
While the break was expected , it is not expected to be more than a pullback before a higher high .
It is not clear that it is over , but most likely so .
The pattern to look for is whether a break is a false break , meaning goes below the lower trendline that has marked low points all the way up ( as this one did ) and then comes back above and stays above .
MarketPulse shows the break of the trendline , and then coming above :
The Dow settled in at a 78 % retrace of the recent high ( the close at 11117 sits right there ) , although went almost all the way back intraday .
The S&P closed a gap at 1203 and sits right at 78 % as well , although it too went a bit higher intraday .
If this were an impulse down , the first drop would be a wave 1 and the bounce back a wave 2 .
Waves 2 can go back 99 % but seldom break 62 % , and almost always when they break 78 % go to new highs .
Thus both major indices sit at the point where any move higher essentially de-confirms a top .
On the other hand , this whole break could be merely a correction , a wave B or minor wave 4 , before a continued advance .
As such , the 78 % rule does not apply .
Besides the obvious move to new highs , watch whether it stays above the trendline , which also de-confirms the break down .
If the top is still ahead , what could flag that it is near ?
One indicator is to watch junk bonds , which act like an intermediary between bonds and equities , and are sensitive to changes in underlying market conditions - specifically , a change in junk indicates a change in riskier bets .
Doug Short has a nice piece today from Chris Kimble which shows how they tend to bottom or top ahead of the S&P :
Another indicator is copper , my favorite " Cunary in the coal mine " .
Copper has been rising in price as well as inventories , indicating real demand .
In 2008 copper prices plunged and inventories rose - no surprise .
As prices rose , inventories got worked off , and inventories turned back up , but prices kept rising .
Usually copper rises early in a recovery , so this is a good sign ; but much of it is attributed to Chinese stockpiling .
As suppy / demand has rebalanced , prices have begun tailing off , an indicator that Chinese tightening is having an effect .
They key to watch is a continued rise in prices , which either reflect a huge " bubble echo " in commodities ( more on that in a later post ) , or a real recovery .
( Funny , the prior link speculates about Peak Copper driving prices up even as inventories stay tight , which to me is yet another indicator that we are in a Bubble Echo in commodities - when oil prices peaked i 2008 , Peak Oil was the explanation , not bubbleconomics ) . )
If instead prices keep dropping with inventories , this indicates slackening demand , and the Cunary chirping " top ahead ! "
Since much of the the Cunary is driven by China , a third indicator is the SSEC , the Shanghai composite .
Emerging markets play a similar role to junk bonds in that they are a riskier place to invest and are sensitive to trend changes .
Trendlines runs a series of posts on the SSEC and is worth checking out .
Their current view is a drop in the SSEE to complete a triangle , then a thrust higher .
We all remember how it bottomed first , in Nov2008 , before our Mar2009 bottom , and led the way up .
Its secondary top after the 2007 peak was back in August 2009 .
If it thrusts higher out of the triangle as Trendlines suggests , we might see it beat the Aug2009 high .
The top after that could give a three or so month early warning of the top in the US .
ContrarianAdvisor , befitting its name , takes the opposite view : the SSEC has just broken below the 50 DMA and the lower trendline of a wedge , and is within a tenth of a percent of the lows for 2010 .
If we stay below the wedge , the SSEC would signal that it is now in the next leg down , and chirp a warning for US stocks .
The potential fall suggested by this pattern is 30 % .
While a fall by the SSEC itself this is not worth much as an indicator , look to see if it is confirmed across other emerging economies , especially the BRIC or BRICKS ( BRIC plus Korea and Singapore ) .
It may be the wedge with three tops so far is presaging a long topping action in the US , the triple top that may emerge from Jan19 , Apr15 and whenever the final top comes between May and August .
More ominously is if the wedge breakdown is due to expectations of China letting the Yuan float again .
The drop in the SSEC has been dramatic - yesterday was nearly a 5 % fall .
So , it turns out those
reports
last October about Foxconn making the new Apple tablet ( renamed iPad ) were probably true .
But it also seems that some of those folks who could n't quite keep a lid on Apple 's secrets may be in very bad positions over in China .
A report stemming from the country and coming just days after
Apple
announced that it had sold 300,000 of their tablets on the first day in America has shocked the collective tech world , and not in a positive way .
Foxconn 's Longhua plant is veiled in secrecy .
It 's said that around 300,000 workers both live and work at the plant , which makes consumer electronics for Apple , Dell , HP , Nokia and tons of other companies that brand the goods you buy and enjoy each day .
It 's a strange situation ; the company keeps a curtain around their methods in order to keep others in the dark , yet no one really asks questions so long as the quality of product is high and we keep getting them cheap .
It 's a Catch 22 , of sorts .
But now , reports from the Chinese media have found that four workers have attempted suicide in the last month alone .
Some say they were and are under great amounts of pressure , and when you consider the demands that are likely being placed on them to produce goods that are in high demand elsewhere in the world , you can probably start to share in the pain .
Electronics Manufacturing Assembly Line - China
Of course , no actual explanation has been given yet , and it's not likely that the truth of the matter will ever be revealed .
Reporters who have tried to gain access into the Foxconn plant have been assaulted , leading us to think that something may not be quite right just inside those locked doors .
We know 300,000 is a large population , but what other employer of any size have you heard of having four suicide attempts in a month ?
Something does n't smell right ...
WASHINGTON , April 26 ( Reuters ) - Conservative Democratic U.S. Senator Ben Nelson broke with party ranks on Monday and voted against opening Senate debate on a proposed crackdown on Wall Street .
Nelson ’s action likely means that the bill will be blocked , at least for now .
Democrats must pickup at least two Republicans to prevail and clear the way for consideration of the bill .
Voting likely to be concluded within minutes .
“ While driving through Milltown , I noticed that you have a street named after Marshal Pétain , ” it began .
“ I find this very disturbing , as he was head of the Vichy government in France during World War II and was responsible for deporting thousands of Jews to Auschwitz . ”
He urged her to change the name as soon as possible .

The letter was read and forgotten until Evan Gottesman , the 15 - year - old son of one of Mr. Mintz ’s friends , heard about the avenue ’s namesake from his father .
He sent letters to the mayor and members of the Borough Council and started a Facebook group , inaccurately called “ Change Pétain Street ! ” featuring a picture of the marshal shaking hands with Adolf Hitler .
Citing Pétain ’s role in the Holocaust and as a collaborator , his letter concluded : “ To not change the name of Petain Avenue would be to not do the right thing . ”
But one person ’s idea of doing the right thing can be another ’s headache and intrusion .
So , the Council soon heard from Marion Servon , who has lived on Petain Avenue for almost 50 years , ever since her widowed mother bought a house there .
She said her memories and family history on the seldom - visited avenue , its namesake ’s history largely forgotten , should not be pushed aside to satisfy someone else .
“ Petain Avenue is not a person , ” she wrote .
“ Petain Avenue is my home , a part of my history and my family ’s history .
We do not want our history changed .
We do not want our street name changed . ”
She also cited the irritation and paperwork that goes along with a changed street address , and her own health issues in the form of heart disease that had resulted in three 911 calls .
She worried that a changed address could affect the response .
In an interview , she said that she admired Evan ’s diligence and concern but that there were more important issues he could spend time on .
“ I just want to go back to being Grandma Marion , ” she said .
Fox News has been the official campaign headquarters for opposition to health care reform .
They dispatched their top personalities to headline rallies and protests .
They consigned thousands of hours of valuable air time to anti-reform politicians and pundits .
They converted their studios into Republican platforms for electioneering and fundraising .
They adopted the Tea Party " movement " so thoroughly that they even rode along on its bus tours and branded its events as Fox enterprises .
And they lost .
Fox News is fond of reminding everyone of their ratings dominance .
Although the cable news universe is comparatively tiny ( Fox News has less than half the viewers of the lowest rated broadcast news program on CBS ) , Fox incessantly boasts that it is the leader in the space .
But the fallout from the health care debate ought to demonstrate precisely how little that victory means in the macro world of politics .
If the number one cable news network cannot sufficiently move public opinion to produce a legislative victory after fourteen months of persistent propaganda , it would be folly to regard them as if they were some formidable bastion of power or influence .
Yet that is exactly how they are regarded by their patrons in the Republican Party ( and many in the press ) .
Last July
I wrote an article describing how " Fox News Is Killing The Republican Party "
Fox has corralled a stable of the most disreputable , unqualified , extremist , lunatics ever assembled , and is presenting them as experts , analysts , and leaders .
These third - rate icons of idiocy are marketed by Fox like any other gag gift ( i.e. pet rocks , plastic vomit , Sarah Palin , etc. ) . [...]
By doubling down on crazy , Fox is driving the center of the Republican Party further down the rabid hole .
They are reshaping the party into a more radicalized community of conspiracy nuts .
So even as this helps Rupert Murdoch 's bottom line , it is making celebrities of political bottom - feeders .
That can't be good for the long - term prospects of the Republican Party . [...]
This is a textbook example of how the extreme rises to the top .
It is also fundamentally contrary to the interests of the Republican Party .
The more the population at large associates Republican ideology with the agenda of Fox News , and the fringe operators residing there , the more the party will be perceived as out of touch , or even out of their minds .
See also : As Fox News Goes Up , The GOP Goes Down
Undoubtedly , Republicans will still embrace Fox News .
They are not about to abandon the media megaphone that they believe is most in tune with their agenda .
Consequently , they will continue to be hampered by the association with unhinged hyperbole like this :
Glenn Beck :
This is the end of prosperity in America forever if this bill passes .
This is the end of America as you know it .
Hannity :
If we get nationalized health care , it 's over ; this is socialism .
Neil Cavuto : National Healthcare : Breeding Ground For Terror ?
In an inspired fit of illogic , Stephen Hayes of the Weekly Standard appeared on Fox News this morning to accuse Democrats of being partisan .
His evidence was that 34 Democrats voted with Republicans against the health care care bill , but no Republicans voted with the Democrats in favor .
Of course , that 's actually evidence that the Democrats were NOT partisan .
They demonstrated some diversity in their views while Republicans all marched in lock - step against the bill .
In further support of this inane argument , Hayes may have uttered the day 's funniest , and most truthful , commentary :
" If Bart Stupak was a Republican crazy he probably would 've stuck with his original position . "
I could n't agree more .
Sticking with his original position against the bill , would certainly have qualified Stupak as a Republican crazy .
And it is generous of Hayes to admit that holding the Republican view is tantamount to being insane .
Where do you go after you 've argued that Armageddon will be the result if your alarms are not heeded ( as GOP chair Michael Steele did today ) and your argument is rejected ?
Do you moderate your rhetoric and attempt to restore civility to the debate ?
Or do you accelerate into a frenzied panic and march a phalanx of livid lemmings over a cliff ?
My money is on the latter , so far as Fox News is concerned .
They still consider it to be in their best interests to manufacture the sort of melodrama that captures television audiences .
Here it 's important to remember that the interests of a television network are worlds apart from those of a political party .
So while Fox is happy to gin up the rancor in hopes of attracting more viewers stimulated by bloody conflicts , the GOP will only be further damaged by the partnership .
However , unfortunately for them , they have nowhere else to go .
Fox News , and a few other rightist authors and radio talkers , have become the de facto face of the Republican Party .
This is a point made by conservative strategist David Frum in his discussion of health care winners and losers :
Yes it mobilizes supporters – but by mobilizing them with hysterical accusations and pseudo - information , overheated talk has made it impossible for representatives to represent and elected leaders to lead .
The real leaders are on TV and radio , and they have very different imperatives from people in government .
Frum goes on to predict that the continuing , and escalating , hysteria will be a boon to right - wing media .
I 'm not sure that I agree with him on that point .
Certainly the hardcore disciples of Beck and company will remain glued to their sets .
But we might also see audiences recede out of frustration and / or fatigue .
After pouring everything they had , including their sanity , into a winner - take - all death match and losing , it would surprise no one if a significant segment of the audience decided to take a vacation from the lunacy .
If an effort as determined and prolonged as the one Fox just concluded could not prevail , then what would it take ?
The good news from all of this is that , as abhorrent as Fox News is , it ought not to be viewed as a Goliath that will crush any opponent .
They gave it their all and came up short .
They huffed and they puffed , but the House stood strong ( oh wait , that was a wolf ) .
This is the clearest evidence yet that Rupert Murdoch 's empire is a paper Fox .
However , that does n't mean that it should be neglected .
It can still bark ferociously and the other members of the media pack continue to give
Fox more credence than they deserve .
And for these reasons we must remain vigilant and prepared to respond to the deceitful and unethical practices of this phony pseudo - news enterprise .
In the long term I continue to believe that an informed public will reject Fox 's brand of shallow and divisive disinformation .
And looking back , the health care debate may one day be perceived as a turning point .
It may be that this long , sordid affair will be the battle that turns the war for responsible journalism to favor reason and truth .
It may be Fox News ' Waterloo .
Those two blocks can power the average high - consumption American home -- one block can power the average European home .
At least that 's the claim being made by K.R. Sridhar , founder of Bloom Energy , on 60 Minutes last night .
The original technology comes from an oxygen generator meant for a scrapped NASA Mars program that 's been converted , with the help of an estimated $ 400 million in private funding , into a fuel cell .
Bloom 's design feeds oxygen into one side of a cell while fuel ( natural gas , bio gas from landfill waste , solar , etc ) is supplied to the other side to provide the chemical reaction required for power .
The cells themselves are inexpensive ceramic disks painted with a secret green " ink " on one side and a black " ink " on the other .
The disks are separated by a cheap metal alloy , instead of more precious metals like platinum , and stacked into a cube of varying capabilities -- a stack of 64 can power a small business like Starbucks .
Now get this , skeptics : there are already several corporate customers using refrigerator - sized Bloom Boxes .
The corporate - sized cells cost $ 700,000 to $ 800,000 and are installed at 20 customers you 've already heard of including FedEx and Wal - mart -- Google was first to this green energy party , using its Bloom Boxes to power a data center for the last 18 months .
Ebay has installed its boxes on the front lawn of its San Jose location .
It estimates to receive almost 15 % of its energy needs from Bloom , saving about $ 100,000 since installing its five boxes 9 months ago -- an estimate we assume does n't factor in the millions Ebay paid for the boxes themselves .
Bloom makes about one box a day at the moment and believes that within 5 to 10 years it can drive down the cost to about $ 3,000 to make it suitable for home use .
Sounds awfully aggressive to us .
Nevertheless , Bloom Energy will go public with details on Wednesday -- until then , check the 60 Minutes sneak peek after the break .

WASHINGTON — President Obama will give a rare interview on Wednesday to Fox News , the cable network that a top administration official once accused of being a political arm of the Republican Party .
The interview , with Bret Baier , an anchor and a former chief White House correspondent for Fox , will be broadcast at 6 p.m. , at the height of a week in which Democrats , including Mr. Obama , are pressing allies and lawmakers to push ahead to get the health care bill passed in the House despite solid Republican opposition and the lessening of public support for the legislation .
At the briefing on Tuesday , Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , was asked if the president believed he could really change the minds of viewers who watch Fox .
It is “ certainly worth a shot , ” Mr. Gibbs said , adding that Mr. Obama was well aware that wavering Democrats and their constituents tuned in to the network .
Last year , however , Obama administration aides used the in -house White House blog and other news media to criticize
Fox for its coverage , particularly its commentary .
Fox officials defended their reporters , taking pains to put distance between pundits and those working the White House and other beats .
Like microscopic inchworms , cancer cells slink away from tumors to travel and settle elsewhere in the body .
Now , researchers at Weill Cornell Medical College report in today ’s online edition of the journal Nature that new anti-cancer agents break down the looping gait these cells use to migrate , stopping them in their tracks .
Mice implanted with cancer cells and treated with the small molecule macroketone lived a full life without any cancer spread , compared with control animals , which all died of metastasis .
When macroketone was given a week after cancer cells were introduced , it still blocked greater than 80 percent of cancer metastasis in mice .
These findings provide a very encouraging direction for development of a new class of anti-cancer agents , the first to specifically stop cancer metastasis , says the study ’s lead investigator , Dr. Xin-Yun Huang , a professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at Weill Cornell Medical College .
“ More than 90 percent of cancer patients die because their cancer has spread , so we desperately need a way to stop this metastasis , ” Dr. Huang says .
“ This study offers a paradigm shift in thinking and , potentially , a new direction in treatment . ”
Dr. Huang and his research team have been working on macroketone since 2003 .
Their work started after researchers in Japan isolated a natural substance , dubbed migrastatin , secreted by Streptomyces bacteria , that is the basis of many antibiotic drugs .
The Japanese researchers noted that migrastatin had a weak inhibitory effect on tumor cell migration .
Dr. Huang and collaborators at the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center then proceeded to build analogues of migrastatin — synthetic and molecularly simpler versions .
“ After a lot of modifications , we made several versions that were a thousand - fold more potent than the original , ” Dr. Huang says .
In 2005 , they published a study showing that several of the new versions , including macroketone , stopped cancer cell metastasis in laboratory animals , but they did n’t know how the agent worked .
In the current study , the researchers revealed the mechanism .
They found that macroketone targets an actin cytoskeletal protein known as fascin that is critical to cell movement .
In order for a cancer cell to leave a primary tumor , fascin bundles actin filaments together like a thick finger .
The front edge of this finger creeps forward and pulls along the rear of the cell .
Cells crawl away in the same way that an inchworm moves .
Macroketone latches on to individual fascin , preventing the actin fibers from adhering to each other and forming the pushing leading edge , Dr. Huang says .
Because individual actin fibers are too soft when they are not bundled together , the cell cannot move .
The new animal experiments detailed in the study confirmed the power of macroketone .
The agent did not stop the cancer cells implanted into the animals from forming tumors or from growing , but it completely prevented tumor cells from spreading , compared with control animals , he says .
Even when macroketone was given after tumors formed , most cancer spread was blocked .
“ This suggests to us that an agent like macroketone could be used to both prevent cancer spread and to treat it as well , ” Dr. Huang says .
“ Of course , because it has no effect on the growth of a primary tumor , such a drug would have to be combined with other anti-cancer therapies acting on tumor cell growth . ”
Also pleasing was the finding that the mice suffered few side effects from the treatment , according to Dr. Huang .
“ The beauty of this approach is that fascin is overexpressed in metastatic tumor cells but is only expressed at a very low level in normal epithelial cells , so a treatment that attacks fascin will have comparatively little effect on normal cells — unlike traditional chemotherapy which attacks all dividing cells , ” he says .
Dr. Huang and his colleagues reported another key finding in the same Nature paper — on X - ray crystal structures of fascin and of the complex of fascin and macroketone .
They demonstrated how macroketone blocks the activity of fascin .
The images showed precisely how macroketone snugly nestles into a pocket of fascin affecting the way it regulates actin filament bundling .
“ The molecular snapshots provide an approach for rational drug design of other molecules inhibiting the function of fascin , the therapeutic target , ” says Dr. Huang .
This work was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense .
Co-researchers include Dr. Lin Chen , Dr. Shengyu Yang and Dr. J. Jillian Zhang — all of Weill Cornell Medical College , and Dr. Jean Jakoncic , from Brookhaven National Laboratory .

When you really need something , it 's natural to worry about running out of it .
Peak oil has been a global preoccupation since the 1970s , and the warnings get louder with each passing year .
Environmentalists emphasize the importance of placing limits on consumption of fossil fuels , but have n't been successful in encouraging people to consume less energy — even with the force of law at their backs .
But maybe they 're going about it all wrong , looking for solutions in the wrong places .
Economists Lucas Bretschger and Sjak Smulders argue that the decisive question is n't to focus directly on preserving the resources we already have .
Instead , they ask : " Is it realistic to predict that knowledge accumulation is so powerful as to outweigh the physical limits of physical capital services and the limited substitution possibilities for natural resources ? "
In other words , can increasing scientific knowledge and technological innovation overcome any limitations to economic growth posed by the depletion of non-renewable resources ?
The debate over peak oil is heavily politicized , so let 's set it aside and test the idea of imminent resource peaks and their consequences for economic growth on three other non-renewable resources : lithium , neodymium , and phosphorus .
Peak Lithium
Lithium is the element at the heart of the electric car revolution that many green energy enthusiasts are trying to foment .
For example , the Chevy Volt , scheduled to be at dealers this fall , will be energized by 400 pounds of lithium ion batteries , plus a gasoline engine to produce electricity to extend the car 's range of travel once the batteries are drained .
In 2007 , William Tahil , an analyst with the France - based consultancy , Meridian International Research , issued a report that alarmingly concluded that there is " insufficient economically recoverable lithium available in the Earth 's crust to sustain electric vehicle manufacture in the volumes required . "
Tahil added , " Depletion rates would exceed current oil depletion rates and switch dependency from one diminishing resource to another . "
Not everyone agrees with Tahil 's peak lithium prognostications .
Geologist R. Keith Evans , who has long been involved in the lithium industry , issued a rebuttal arguing that lithium resources are much higher than estimated by Tahil .
Evans also asserts that as prices rise other sources of lithium will become economical .
And lithium prices have indeed been increasing .
But for the sake of argument , let 's assume we are " running out " of lithium ?
So then what ?
Even Tahil 's original report argued that there were alternative battery technologies in the works using far more common substances that could substitute for lithium .
For example , the Swiss company ReVolt is developing rechargeable zinc - air batteries which hold 300 percent more charge than lithium ion batteries and cost half as much .
And then there is Fluidic Energy which claims that it can develop a metal air battery that will hold 11 times the charge of the best lithium ion batteries for less than one - third the cost .
A car running on such batteries would have a range of 400 to 500 miles on a single charge .
These batteries are made from far more available materials which can be fairly easily recycled .
Peak Neodymium
Neodymium is a rare earth metal used extensively to produce permanent magnets found in everything from computer magnetic disks and cell phones to wind turbines and automobiles .
For example , the magnets that drive a Prius hybrid 's electric motor use more than two pounds of neodymium .
Interestingly , neodymium magnets were invented in the 1980s to overcome the global cobalt supply shock that occurred as the result of internal warfare in Zaire .
Because China can more cheaply produce neodymium than any other country in the world , that country is now the source of 95 percent of the world 's neodymium .
Recently , however , China 's government warned that it would begin restricting exports of neodymium ( and other rare earth metals ) in order to insure supplies for its own manufacturers .
In March , Rep. Mike Coffman ( R - Colo ) introduced his Rare Earth Supply - Chain Technology and Resource Transformation ( RESTART )
Act of 2010 .
The RESTART
Act would offer federal loan guarantees to mining and refining companies to recreate in five years a domestic rare earth minerals industry .
Rare earth minerals independence , if you will .
On the other hand , if neodymium supplies really are a problem , perhaps there is a technical fix .
For example , the privately held Chorus Motors has invented and developed an improved AC induction motor that completely eliminates the permanent neodymium magnets to supply the energy needed to accelerate hybrid or electric vehicles .
If this technology is widely adopted , it would free up neodymium supplies for other uses and also tend to lower the metal 's price
Peak Phosphorus
In the 1840s , scientists discovered that plants need the element phosphorus to grow .
The phosphorus fertilizer industry grew rapidly , initially by exploiting vast deposits of seabird guano left on oceanic islands .
Today phosphate rocks are mined to produce the fertilizer .
The Global Phosphorus Research Initiative ( GPRI ) notes that modern agriculture is dependent on continual inputs of phosphorus fertilizer and that known reserves could be depleted within the next 50 to 100 years .
The current issue of Foreign Policy ominously warns that failing to meet the challenge of " peak phosphorus " would mean that " humanity faces a Malthusian trap of widespread famine on a scale that we have not yet experienced . "
But unlike petroleum or natural gas , phosphorus , as an element , is not destroyed when it 's used and so could be recovered and recycled .
The folks at the GPRI point out that the phosphorus in just one person 's urine would be close to the amount needed to fertilize the food supply for one person .
So why not recycle urine ?
In fact , NoMix toilets have been invented which allow for the collection of urine separate from solid wastes , allowing phosphorus and nitrogen to be recovered and used as fertilizer .
In addition , crop biotechnologists are exploring ways to produce plants that dramatically increase the efficiency with which they use phosphorus , which would reduce the amount fertilizer needed to grow a given amount of food .
Stanford University economist Paul Romer has observed , " Every generation has perceived the limits to growth that finite resources and undesirable side effects would pose if no new recipes or ideas were discovered .
And every generation has underestimated the potential for finding new recipes and ideas .
We consistently fail to grasp how many ideas remain to be discovered .
The difficulty is the same one we have with compounding : possibilities do not merely add up ; they multiply . "
The above examples show that while the production of physical supplies of resources may peak , there is no sign that human creativity is about to peak .

The unveiling of Gov. Chris Christie ’s budget makes clear what so many teachers already knew : Behind all the teacher - bashing rhetoric lies a campaign to degrade the quality of public education in New Jersey .
New Jersey has been known nationwide for its stalwart schools .
If Christie ’s budget is allowed to pass , that will soon be a distant memory .
His budget represents an outrageous attack from a man whose children are in private school and who has a bizarre vendetta against public schools .
Our school district , Bridgewater - Raritan Regional , is facing a 55 - percent reduction in state aid for next year , in addition to what has already been cut from the current year .
We simply cannot sustain that level of damage to the education we are obligated to provide our youth .
Christie ’s cuts are not trimming off fat .
They were already hitting the meat and bone of the public education system , and now they have gouged the marrow .
His cuts are resulting in massive layoffs of teachers , causing the student - teacher ratio to rise dramatically .
It is well known in education that the more class sizes grow , the less education can take place for each individual student .
In this situation , the most self - sufficient will get by , but struggling students will be left behind .
Teachers will be classroom managers more than educators .
That is not what a New Jersey education is about .
Students will also suffer because important programs are being cut .
Reading recovery and programs for the disadvantaged , foreign language , high school electives that many students rely on to keep them interested in school , after - school programs and clubs , sports and other activities are all washing away in the flood of Christie ’s Draconian cuts .
What are our youth supposed to do ?
Under Christie 's regime , they will languish .
They will not develop as they should , in the tradition of a strong New Jersey education .
Christie must be stopped .
No man should be able to wreck the education of the youth of this state with a budget that has its priorities completely backwards and violates the state school funding formula .
No one should have the power to rob our children of their right to a quality education and programs that allow them to develop and flourish .
Our children deserve better .
If the state 's lawmakers do not put an end to this shameful mockery of public policy , they will have forfeited the right to look any child in the eye and claim to have his best interest at heart .
And they should be promptly removed from public office .

Who is Barack Obama ?
If you ask a conservative Republican , you are likely to hear that Obama is a skilled politician who campaigned as a centrist but is governing as a big - government liberal .
He plays by ruthless , Chicago politics rules .
He is arrogant toward foes , condescending toward allies and runs a partisan political machine .
If you ask a liberal Democrat , you are likely to hear that Obama is an inspiring but overly intellectual leader who has trouble making up his mind and fighting for his positions .
He has not defined a clear mission .
He has allowed the Republicans to dominate debate .
He is too quick to compromise and too cerebral to push things through .
You ’ll notice first that these two viewpoints are diametrically opposed .
You ’ll , observe , second , that they are entirely predictable .
Political partisans always imagine the other side is ruthlessly effective and that the public would be with them if only their side had better messaging .
And finally , you ’ll notice that both views distort reality .
They tell you more about the information cocoons that partisans live in these days than about Obama himself .
The fact is , Obama is as he always has been , a center - left pragmatic reformer .
Every time he tries to articulate a grand philosophy  from his book “ The Audacity of Hope ” to his joint - session health care speech last September  he always describes a moderately activist government restrained by a sense of trade - offs .
He always uses the same on - the - one - hand - on - the - other sentence structure .
Government should address problems without interfering with the dynamism of the market .
There 's nothing worse than holding an ice cold brewski on a hot summer day and having no way to open it .
If you 're a Bud fan , you 'll have no problem opening the bottle because most mass - market beers have twist - off caps .
But if you have a taste for finer , more expensive brews , you 'll more than likely run into the pry - off caps .

Pry - offs are used mainly because companies believe it provides a better seal against one of beer 's greatest enemies — oxygen .
Plus it 's a cheaper alternative for craft brewers than using screw tops .
But let 's get back to actually popping off that pry-off .
If you do n't have a bottle opener handy , and you 're not willing to injure your hand trying to pull it off , then you 'll need to get in tune with your inner MacGyver .
If you 're a smoker , your lighter works great .
But what if you do n't smoke ?
What are the other DIY bottle opener options out there ?
If you 're insane , you can try using a spinning motorcycle tire or a nail gun or any of the other 50 + crazy ways to open a beer bottle like Chris Sumers and Adam Young ...

But if you want to be a little more practical , I 'd go the safer route ...
1. Another Beer Bottle Firstly , the most likely instance is that you have another beer bottle on hand , which makes for a great bottle opener .
Just hold one bottle upside - down , cap to cap to the other one , and apply pressure .
As long as you are n't drinking the last beer in the fridge , this trick is a serious one to have in your arsenal .

2. Apple Power Adapter
Use your iPad 's power adapter to open your bottle .
You just need to pull the little wall plug ( or cord ) off and use the AC adapter as your bottle opener .
This will also work with yout Mac 's power adapters .

3. Countertop
If you 're not a Mac or iPad owner , surely you 're a countertop owner , which makes for a fine top - popper .
But you probably should n't to this in a public place , since it might damage the counter .

6. Wedding Ring
What could be more convenient to use as a bottle opener than your wedding ring ?
Please enable JavaScript to watch this video .
The video places a lot of emphasis on using a gold ring , though I would assume you would n't want to do this a lot with an actual gold ring considering how soft gold is .
7. Computer Mouse Trying to open a beer why you 're reading this ?
Then grab that computer mouse in front of you .
It 's not just for clicking .
The Radost shows you how ( in mid- game , too ! ) .

8. Your Teeth Upon making this list , my friend Beth informed me that she had seen people open bottles with nothing but their own teeth .
Naturally , I said " intense ! " and immediately began searching to see if this could actually be done .
And guess what I found ?

9. Carabiner
Not many folks will be trying to open a beer on the side of a mountain , but if you 've got a rock climbing carabiner ( or just any metal carabiner ) , it 's got a nice little latch on it perfect for pry - off beer caps .

10 . Chainsaw I do n't recommend doing this last one unless you seriously know what you 're doing .
That being said , it 's one of the coolest things I 've ever seen !
I mean , c'mon ... it 's a freaking chainsaw .

Bonus : Opening Corked Wine Bottles
What if you 're more of a wine drinker ?
How are you going to get that cork out of the bottle without a corkscrew ?
If you 've got a screw , screwdriver and a hammer , you 're good to go .

So , what do you think ?
Obviously there are more ways to open beer bottles without a bottle opener , but there 's just way too many to put in one article .
Can you think of any other good ways ?

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Usually it takes a national government to spend itself into a debt measured in the trillions .
Yet it comes as little surprise that the same profligacy that pervades the corridors of federal power infects this country ’s 87,000 state , county and municipal governments and school districts .
By 2013 , the amount of retirement money promised to employees of these public entities will exceed cash on hand by more than a trillion dollars .
That ’s according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College , which earlier this month released a troubling analysis of 126 state and local pension plans .
The center ’s researchers found in the wake of the stock market collapse that measures of pension program solvency hit a 15 - year low with no signs of improvement on the horizon .
This means taxpayers will be left picking up the tab .
The reason pension plans are headed toward financial disaster is simple .
Ever -expanding public - sector unions have flexed their political muscle and larded up with lavish benefits to be be paid out decades from now .
In a properly run , private - sector business , future retirement benefits are paid for using present - day contributions .
This is not the case when lawmakers have the power to boost public - employee benefit packages while using accounting gimmicks to conceal and pass on the debt to future generations .
California ’s public - employee retirement system stands in the most perilous condition , facing a half - trillion in unfunded liabilities .
That ’s not surprising when you consider a California highway patrol officer can retire at age 50 and collect up to 90 percent of his salary for the rest of his life .
According to the agency ’s website , a typical officer ’s pay will reach $ 109,147 after just five years on duty - an amount that can rise significantly with overtime benefits .
That means a fit and healthy 50 - year - old “ retiree ” who began work at age 20 would receive $ 98,232 a year from taxpayers for the rest of his life , and nothing prevents him from taking another government job to collect two paychecks .
This form of double - dipping is rampant .
While most private - sector firms have trimmed their work force during the recession to achieve more efficient and profitable operations , public agencies have expanded .
State and local governments employ about 15 million individuals , a figure that has jumped up 40 percent from 1992 .
By 2016 , the number of state and local bureaucrats is projected to reach 20 million .
Too many of these people are being promised far too much money , leaving state and local systems as bankrupt as Social Security , Medicare and other multitrillion - dollar federal entitlements .
To his credit , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger considers addressing his state ’s “ pension bubble ” to be one of his top priorities .
On Wednesday , he introduced legislation that would raise the full retirement age for new police hires to 57 and reduce the benefit paid in our example to $ 88,409 .
It also would reclassify billboard and milk inspectors as “ miscellaneous ” employees , instead of “ safety ” workers entitled to bigger handouts .
Despite the modest nature of the proposed changes , it ’s unclear whether California lawmakers have the backbone needed to pass the measure over the objection of the all - powerful union voting bloc .
The rest of voters across the nation , the ones who will be paying for this mess , need to wake up and encourage legislators to reform public pensions before it ’s too late .

Posted on by Seitan
Without further ado , I think it behooves me to post the simplest , easiest recipe for seitan .
Here ’s all you really need to know :
Mix wheat gluten with equal parts water , kneed for 10 minutes , boil for an hour .
Voila , Seitan .
Let me expand on that a bit , though .
1 cup wheat gluten
1/4-1/2 teaspoon of basil
1/4-1/2 teaspoon of savory ( You can subsitute your own spices , or go without , if you do n’t see the need )
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce ( Also optional )
1 cup water or vegetable broth ( to make the dough )
5 - 7 additional cups of vegetable both ( or water ) to boil the Seitan in .
You could make a stew instead , if you like .
1 . Mix the wheat gluten and the spices while dry .
If you dump them in with the water , they wo n’t mix thoroughly .
2 . Add a cup of vegetable broth or water .
3. Kneed for 10 minutes or so .
This is going to be harder than kneeding bread .
Insufficient kneeding results in subpar Seitan .
If you have a bread machine or standalone mixer , I strongly recomend using it .
If you are going to be doing this often ( we make Seitan about once a week ) , I would recomend obtaining one .
It does n’t have to be fancy ( or even fully functioning – after all , you are just going to be using it to kneed the dough .
4 . Bring the rest of the water or vegetable broth to a boil .
5 . Break the seitan into small chunks .
Keep in mind it ’s going to triple or quadruple in size once it absorbs the water .
We usually dice it up with a knife before pulling it apart – it ’s easier that way .
6 . Plop the seitan chunks into the boiling pot .
Let simmer for an hour , stirring occasionally .
You ’ll want to watch the pot .
As the Seitan expands , it will also start to float , which can result in the top being popped off .
Then end result , if you flavour with basil and savory , tastes just like fake turkey slices , though the texture is much softer and gooier : good in it ’s own way .
To make firmer seitan requires a few other tricks , we will divulge shortly .
There you have it .
You can find wheat gluten in any store , though it ’s usually sold in small , not very cost - effective bags , which are certainly fine for a first attempt .
However , as I posted before , we ’ve graduated to 50 lbs bags we purchased online , and the finished seitan costs about 75 cents a pound , which I believe is about as cheap as protein can get , not to mention delicious protein ..
Wheat gluten also keeps forever as long as it remains dry : I had some that was kept cool and dry for over 5 years , a few months ago : it was indistinguishable from the fresh bag we just bought .

South African police are investigating allegations of attempted rape as part of the investigation into the murder of white supremacist Eugene Terre ' blanche .
The lawyer for one of the two black farm workers charged with the killing that heightened racial tensions was quoted as saying that Terre ' blanche was killed after trying to have sex with at least one of the defendants .
‘ My instructions from my client are that there was some sodomy going on and it sparked the murder of Mr Terre ' blanche , ’ Puna Moroko , attorney for 28 - year - old Chris Mahlangu , told the Sunday Times newspaper .
A police spokesman confirmed that was among possibilities being investigated .
Police had earlier said a pay dispute had led to the killing of Terre ' blanche , on the political margins since his efforts to preserve apartheid in the early 1990s .
‘ We are not going to focus on one thing , ’ said Musa Zondi of the Hawks investigative unit , adding that a sexual link was among the many accusations being made over the case .
‘ We will investigate all pertinent facts that have a bearing on the matter , ’ he said .
General Jan Mabula , head of the Hawks in the North West Province , told City Press newspaper the suspects ' clothes were to be examined as part of checks into whether there was a sexual link .
Zondi did not comment on that .
Terre ' blanche was hacked and battered to death on 3 April and found with his trousers pulled down after a murder that has showed up the racial strains in the country .
Terre ' blanche 's Afrikaner Resistance Movement ( AWB ) has rejected any suggestion of a homosexual link to the murder of its leader , who was one of the most vocal proponents of Apartheid .
NASA 's Cassini Discovers Potential Liquid Water on Enceladus
Image right : Plumes of icy material extend above the southern polar region of Saturn ’s moon Enceladus as imaged by the Cassini spacecraft in February 2005 .
The monochrome view is presented along with a color - coded version on the right .
The latter reveals a fainter and much more extended plume component .

NASA 's Cassini spacecraft may have found evidence of liquid water reservoirs that erupt in Yellowstone - like geysers on Saturn 's moon Enceladus .
The rare occurrence of liquid water so near the surface raises many new questions about the mysterious moon .
" We realize that this is a radical conclusion -- that we may have evidence for liquid water within a body so small and so cold , " said Dr. Carolyn Porco , Cassini imaging team leader at Space Science Institute , Boulder , Colo .
" However , if we are right , we have significantly broadened the diversity of solar system environments where we might possibly have conditions suitable for living organisms .
" High - resolution Cassini images show icy jets and towering plumes ejecting large quantities of particles at high speed .
Scientists examined several models to explain the process .
They ruled out the idea that the particles are produced by or blown off the moon 's surface by vapor created when warm water ice converts to a gas .
Instead , scientists have found evidence for a much more exciting possibility -- the jets might be erupting from near - surface pockets of liquid water above 0 degrees Celsius ( 32 degrees Fahrenheit ) , like cold versions of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone .
Mission scientists report these and other Enceladus findings in this week 's issue of Science .
" We previously knew of at most three places where active volcanism exists : Jupiter 's moon Io , Earth , and possibly Neptune 's moon Triton .
Cassini changed all that , making Enceladus the latest member of this very exclusive club , and one of the most exciting places in the solar system , " said Dr. John Spencer , Cassini scientist , Southwest Research Institute , Boulder , Colo .
" Other moons in the solar system have liquid - water oceans covered by kilometers of icy crust , " said Dr. Andrew Ingersoll , imaging team member and atmospheric scientist at the California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , Calif .
" What 's different here is that pockets of liquid water may be no more than tens of meters below the surface .
" Other unexplained oddities now make sense .
" As Cassini approached Saturn , we discovered that the Saturnian system is filled with oxygen atoms .
At the time we had no idea where the oxygen was coming from , " said Dr. Candy Hansen , Cassini scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena .
" Now we know that Enceladus is spewing out water molecules , which break down into oxygen and hydrogen .
" Scientists are also seeing variability at Enceladus .
" Even when Cassini is not flying close to Enceladus , we can detect that the plume 's activity has been changing through its varying effects on the soup of electrically - charged particles that flow past the moon , " said Dr. Geraint H. Jones , Cassini scientist , magnetospheric imaging instrument , Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research , Katlenburg - Lindau , Germany .
Scientists still have many questions .
Why is Enceladus currently so active ?
Are other sites on Enceladus active ?
Might this activity have been continuous enough over the moon 's history for life to have had a chance to take hold in the moon 's interior ?
" Our search for liquid water has taken a new turn .
The type of evidence for liquid water on Enceladus is very different from what we 've seen at Jupiter 's moon Europa .
On Europa the evidence from surface geological features points to an internal ocean .
On Enceladus the evidence is direct observation of water vapor venting from sources close to the surface , " said Dr. Peter Thomas , Cassini imaging scientist , Cornell University , Ithaca , N.Y.
In the spring of 2008 , scientists will get another chance to look at Enceladus when Cassini flies within 350 kilometers ( approximately 220 miles ) , but much work remains after Cassini 's four - year prime mission is over .
" There 's no question that , along with the moon Titan , Enceladus should be a very high priority for us .
Saturn has given us two exciting worlds to explore , " said Dr. Jonathan Lunine , Cassini interdisciplinary scientist , University of Arizona , Tucson , Ariz .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
JPL , a division of the Caltech , manages the mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate .
The Cassini orbiter was designed , developed and assembled at JPL .

Crush videos feature small animals … being slowly crushed or impaled by a woman wearing stiletto heels .
…
The Supreme Court decided … the law prohibiting such videos was too broad .
As written , for example , the law could be construed to prohibit a deer - hunting video , which , though some might find cruel , relates to a legal activity . …
Obviously , no one ever intended that the free - speech provision of the Constitution protect the rights of deviants to torture animals and then to market videos for the sexual satisfaction of people who , by their tastes , are a probable threat to society . …
[ Representatives ] introduced a … [ new bill ] to narrowly focus the [ overturned law ] .
…
Although it specifically exempts hunting videos , animal rights advocates worry that it leaves a loophole .
Hypothetically , a crush video could be built around a legitimate hunting scene and thus be protected from prosecution . …
The challenge to Congress is … :
There is no argument ever to justify torturing animals and no defense — ever — for selling videos created to profit from that torture .
Figure it out .
Fix it .. ( more )
This seems to argue that it should be illegal to distribute a video of a legal activity , e.g. , hunting , because this might result in “ sexual satisfaction of people who , by their tastes , are a probable threat to society . ”
So the claim is either that it is bad to satisfy such tastes , even if no one else is affected , or that satisfying such tastes will intensify their “ threat to society . ”
Perhaps such a threat intensification exists , but I ’d need more concrete evidence of it before prohibiting otherwise harmless activities on that basis .
“ Tolerance ” is a feel - good buzzword in our society , but I fear people have forgotten what it means .
Many folks are proud of their “ tolerance ” for gays , working women , Tibetan monks in cute orange outfits , or blacks sitting at the front of the bus .
But what they really mean is that they consider such things to be completely appropriate parts of their society , and are not bothered by them in the slightest .
That , however , is n’t “ tolerance . ”
“ Tolerance ” is where you tolerate things that actually bother you .
Things that make you go “ ick ” , or that conflict with strong intuitions on proper behavior .
Once upon a time , the idea of gay sex made most folks quite uncomfortable , and yet many of those folks still advocated tolerance for gay sex .
Their argument was not that gay sex is n’t icky , but that a broad society should be reluctant to ban apparently victimless activities merely because many find them icky .
Someday soon , technology will allow an explosion of possible creatures and behaviors , many of which will seem icky to many others .
No doubt it will be appropriate for some communities to ban some of them , but we face a very real danger of insufficient tolerance threatening our peace and prosperity .
The alternative to living peacefully with those we dislike , may be to instead die with them .
Please , in preparation , let us learn to practice tolerance with the smaller variations we face today .
Unless we see a clearer harm from letting some folks watch vids of cruel but legal hunting , let us tolerate it .
Same for polygamy , polyandry , or digitally - created kid porn .
You do n’t have to like them , or approve them , to tolerate them .
Added :
Alex suggests “ social change is not much driven by changes in tolerance . ”
Added 5 p : Note that the people who are actually the most tolerant are marginalized folks with strong opinions , like fundamentalist Islamists in the US , or politically - right profs in academia .
By necessity , most such folks frequently tolerate bothersome behaviors by others .

Dmytri Kleiner , a German mutualist activist , who recently published a Telekommunisten Manifesto , argues a free market is impossible under capitalist conditions :
“ Capitalism depends on the appropriation of value for its subsistence and growth .
The disingenuous rhetoric of the “ Free Market ” is a smoke screen to justify a system of privilege and exploitation , better called the “ Casino Market , ” there are certainly some conspicuous winners , but the odds always favour the house .
Any organised attempt to beat the odds will be excluded , perhaps violently .
In a genuine free market , competition among producers would reduce the price of everything to the lowest level that it can be produced for .
If everything truly traded in a perfect “ market , ” then land and capital , like labour would never be able to earn any more than the cost of providing it .
There could be no class that is exempt from working as there would be no income to sustain such a class .
For a Capitalist class to exist , the market must be rigged , and all markets are .
Capitalism must increase the price of Capital by withholding it from labour .
In reality , the “ free market ” is what property owners want to impose on workers , while retaining their own privileges .
Capital needs to make the price of labour low enough to prevent workers , as a class , from being able to retain enough of their own earnings to acquire their own property .
If workers could acquire their own property , they could also stop selling their labour to the capitalists .
Capitalism could not exist in a free market .
The whole idea of the “ free market ” is part of the mythology of capitalism , is not possible within capitalism and just as unlikely to exist without it .
“ Free ” from the coercion of profit - seeking Capitalists , producers would produce for social value , not for profits , as they do in their private and family lives , and as they have in non-capitalist communities .
This is not to say that a free society would not have competition or that it ’s members would not seek to benefit from their own labour , the division of labour required in a complex society implies exchange and reciprocity .
However the metaphor of “ the market ” as it is currently used would no longer dominate .
The “ Market Economy ” is by definition a surveillance economy , where contributions to production and consumption must be measured in minute detail , it is an economy of accountants and security guards .
The need to account value exchange in tiny and reductive lists of individually priced transactions must be superseded by more fluid and generalized forms of exchange .
The motive to maximize profit from ownership , so often the driving force behind irrational and destructive production , would give way to much stronger motive , doing work that has direct benefits for our lives and our society , production that fulfills our real world needs and desires .
Without the need to measure our consumption and production to appease the imposers of capitalist control , workers in a free society may not bother producing exclusively for exchange within a “ Market Economy , ” they may more often produce what they want and what their community needs and share based on mutual respect .
This type of economy does not resemble a “ market . ”
A market is not a free space .
Control of the physical location of the market has always been the domain of hierarchy and authority , and proximity to the market is the textbook example of unearned income ; economic rent .
The Market stall is a physical manifestation of the division between producer and consumer .
None of these seem like essential characteristics of a free society .
Instead of an idealised and impossible “ Free Market , ” a workers economy would be better imagined as a “ Network Economy , ” where independent participants exchange according their mutual desires within the context of a common platform , not centrally controlled by any of them , but composed of their own voluntary interconnections . ”
A vandal has spray - painted an abusive message on the house in southern Germany in which Pope Benedict was born .
Police spokesman Konrad Rutzinger says the graffiti was sprayed in blue on the front door of the house , a three - storey , 264 - year - old building in Marktl am Inn in the predominantly Catholic state of Bavaria .
He says the message seems to be linked to the abuse scandals that have engulfed the Catholic Church .
" F*** yourselves , " read the graffiti , according to photographs published in the German press .
It has been hastily painted over .
A recent survey found that a quarter of Germany 's Catholics were considering quitting the Church in the wake of reports of hundreds of cases of sexual abuse by clerics , some many decades old .
Last week clerics in Germany used Easter sermons to pray for the victims as public sentiment against the Church turned decidedly negative .

The goal of the bluebear project is to raise attention on privacy issues when using the Internet .
In particular , we want to show that without any dedicated infrastructure , it is possible to globally compromise the privacy of Internet users .
The Internet has never been designed with privacy in mind .
For instance , the Internet is based on the IP protocol that exposes the IP address of a user to any other users it is communicating with .
However , we believe that current users of the Internet do not realize how much they compromise their privacy by using the Internet .
Indeed , the common wisdom is that there are so many users in the Internet that it is not feasible for an attacker , apart may be for national agencies , to globally compromise the privacy of a large fraction of users .
Therefore , finding a specific user is like looking for a needle in a haystack .
Contributions
It is possible to monitor all BitTorrent downloads and all BitTorrent content providers .
BitTorrent is arguably the most efficient peer - to - peer protocol for content replication .
However , BitTorrent has not been designed with privacy in mind and its popularity could threaten the privacy of millions of users .
Surprisingly , privacy threats due to BitTorrent have been overlooked because BitTorrent popularity gives its users the illusion that finding them is like looking for a needle in a haystack .
The goal of this project is to explore the severity of the privacy threats faced by BitTorrent users .
We argue that it is possible to continuously monitor from a single machine most BitTorrent users and to identify the content providers ( also called initial seeds ) [ LLL_LEET10 , LLL_TR10 ] .
This is a major privacy threat as it is possible for anybody in the Internet to reconstruct all the download and upload history of most BitTorrent users .
Using an anonymizing network does not help
It is possible to map your social identity to your network activity .
To circumvent the kind of monitoring with described for BitTorrent , BitTorrent users are increasingly using anonymizing networks such as Tor to hide their IP address from the tracker and , possibly , from other peers .
However , we showed that it is possible to retrieve the IP address for more than 70 % of BitTorrent users on top of Tor [ LML_LEET11 ] .
Moreover , once the IP address of a peer is retrieved , it is possible to link to the IP address other applications used by this peer on top of Tor .
The fact that it is hard for a person to map an IP address to an identity mitigates the impact of the privacy attacks we described .
However , we show that we can exploit a peer - to - peer VoIP system to associate a social identity ( name , email address , etc. ) to an IP address [ LZL_IMC11 ] .
This means that anybody can now find this mapping that was only known by ISPs or big companies ( like Google and Facebook ) , but never communicated unless in case of a legal action .
The privacy threat is thus very high because this mapping enables blackmail , social attacks , targeted phishing attacks , etc .
As a proof of concept , we show that it is possible to track VoIP users mobility and BitTorrent downloads [ LZL_IMC11 ] .
For Robert Carrizzo , the daily commute from his Midtown office to the Staten Island Ferry is typically filled with precise rituals .
But there is always one irritating question mark : the cost of the taxi ride .
The price of what should be a short and fairly standard trip is like the price of a volatile stock .
It is never the same and frequently varies by several dollars .
Mr. Carrizzo , 46 , a director at a bank , said he recently complained to a cabby that the taxi ’s meter was surely broken , getting in reply only a verbal shrug .
“ He said , ‘ I ’ll check it out , ’ ” Mr. Carrizzo recalled .
So it was with some sense of satisfaction that Mr. Carrizzo learned that his suspicion that he was being cheated had apparently been validated .
On Friday , the city ’s Taxi and Limousine Commission said that thousands of taxi drivers had routinely been gouging riders .
HANOVER , Germany —
It sounds like something from a sci- fi film , but one in four Germans would be happy to have a microchip implanted in their body if they derived concrete benefits from it , a poll Monday showed .
The survey , by German IT industry lobby group BITKOM , was intended to show how the division between real life and the virtual world is increasingly coming down , one of the main themes of the CeBIT trade fair that kicks off Tuesday .
ADVERTISEMENT
In all , 23 percent of around 1,000 respondents in the survey said they would be prepared to have a chip inserted under their skin “ for certain benefits . ”
Around one in six ( 16 percent ) said they would wear an implant to allow emergency services to rescue them more quickly in the event of a fire or accident .
And five percent of people said they would be prepared to have an implant to make their shopping go more smoothly .
But 72 percent said they would not “ under any circumstances ” allow electronics in their body .
The results appeared to surprise even the high - tech sector .

“ This is of course an extreme example of how far people can imagine networks going , ” said BITKOM chief August - Wilhelm Scheer .
The CeBIT , the world ’s biggest high - tech fair , throws its doors open to the public on Tuesday , with Spain , the current EU president , this year ’s guest of honour .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero were due to speak later Monday in an official opening ceremony before touring the exhibition early Tuesday .

We were already dreading the day Hubble dies , but this mind - blowing new image released to celebrate the space telescope 's 20th anniversary makes us wish for eternal life for the famous satellite even more .
This new gem rivals what may be Hubble 's most famous image , a shot of the Pillars of Creation taken in 1995 .
The shot above is of a star - forming region in the Carina Nebula .
The enormous pillar of gas and dust is 3 light - years tall .
The seam in the middle is the result of new stars forming and emitting powerful gas jets that are ripping the pillar apart .
Hubble 's capabilities are all the more impressive considering the rocky start the telescope suffered through when a defect was discovered in its primary mirror after it had been launched and began returning images that were n't in focus .
Scientists and engineers were able to fix the problem , and today Hubble is more capable than ever with its new Wide Field Camera 3 , installed last year .

Jesus , seriously , I 'm getting tired of your Apple - biased articles .
If the iPad can be marketable soley on it's app market , so can Google 's version .
The iPad * is* a giant iPod .
It 's an ARM SoC tied in to a large display .
Apple did it for the apps .
It 's obvious that they 'll make more money off of people via apps than they will off of selling the actual product .
iTunes is the same way for them .
Apple sells software now moreso than hardware .
It makes them more money .
If they 'd dropped an x86 processor into the iPad and OSX , they would have had a much better device , but they would n't have been able to lock down the device ( prevent Flash ) or sell owners a zillion apps .
It 's silly ( and that 's why Google mocked it ) but it makes money .
And at least Google 's device wo n't tell us what we want and how we 're allowed to have it .
So seriously , stop paying lip service to Apple and figure this out ; Apple and Google are businesses , they 'll go where the money is .
All that matters is how dirty they 're willing to get to do it .
Apple tells it 's consumers what they can and can't have , ( or , more appropriately , " you can have what we 're selling , you can't have what we 're not selling " ) .
That 's fine for some people , but not for all of us .
Microsoft 's primary goal at the time was to do one thing : beat Palm .
And at the time Pocket PC was introduced , Microsoft had the keys it needed for success .
From music to books and games to maps and location service , the Pocket PC platform had it all , and the new devices , particularly the iPAQ , were like nothing else on the market .
Microsoft was so focused on taking on Palm , however , that the company could n't figure out how to change the message that Palm was so successfully telling the market .
Even if the strategy was fundamentally correct , the short term tactics were ineffective .
The net result was a team that went through countless re-organizations and was never able to drive platform forward with the innovation it needed -- as we all know , later revs of Window Mobile were mostly tweaks on the original platform .
Pocket PCs were the first devices that could serve as a mobile office with email and Office applications , yet also offer games , music , and movies .
Pocket PC may be no more , but there were some important lessons learned from what Microsoft attempted to do .
The platform and hardware were a leap forward .
With the inclusion of Windows Media Player and tight integration with the desktop , Pocket PC began to blur the lines of business and consumer functionality -- these were the first devices that could serve as a mobile office with email and Office applications , yet also offer games , music , and movies .
Pocket PC was also the first platform to have a fully integrated e-book architecture , called Microsoft Reader .
Sadly , Microsoft 's total focus on Palm and the business market combined with later efforts to take on RIM and the BlackBerry meant that these features were ignored and totally shunned from most of the marketing .
It was n't until 2007 when Apple introduced the iPhone that attention refocused to the mass market consumer and not just the business market .
The world has moved from disconnected PDAs to connected phones and other devices , and most of the companies that showcased devices in New York have also moved on .
HP 's Jornada line died when the company merged with Compaq , and although HP still markets several Windows Phone devices under the iPAQ brand , the company is no longer considered an innovator in the space .
After several other product introductions , Casio also gave up and is now just another footnote in the mobile market .
And Microsoft is rebooting its mobile efforts entirely with Windows Phone 7 and Kin -- this time not in response to Palm , but to Apple .
We 'll see if the company can apply the lessons of the past 10 years to the next 10 .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The House of Representatives on Saturday night passed a sweeping health care bill by a vote of 220 - 215 .
With the passage of H.R. 3962 , the Affordable Health Care for America
Act , proponents of health care reform took an important step forward , but turning the bill into law remains uncertain .
It 's unclear when the Senate will vote on a version of the health care legislation debated in that chamber .
If the Senate passes its bill , the House and Senate bills would have to be reconciled into one document and voted on again .
The House Democrats needed 218 votes to ensure passage of the bill .
On Saturday , it appeared the vote would come down to the wire , as the intentions of some conservative Democrats remained unknown .
In the final tally , 219 Democrats voted for the legislation , and 39 voted against it .
Rep. Joe Cao ( R - Louisiana ) was the only Republican who voted in favor of the bill .

Democrats began counting down with eight seconds left in the voting period and erupted in a loud cheer when the hotly debated legislation was passed .
Republicans in the chamber stood across the floor , some with their arms folded .
" Oh what a night , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a news conference after the House adjourned its session for the night .
She thanked President Obama and her colleagues who fought to get the bill passed .
The Republican National Committee released a statement after the vote .
" Today with help from their liberal House allies , President Obama and Nancy Pelosi finally got what they have been creating behind closed doors these past months -- a government - run health careexperiment that will increase families ' health care costs , increase the deficit , increase taxes on small businesses and the middle class , and cut Medicare , " the statement said .
Earlier , the House passed an amendment to pending health care legislation that prohibits federal funds for abortion services in the public option and in the insurance " exchange " the bill would create .
The vote passed 240- 194 .
Share your thoughts on the health care debate
A second amendment considered by the House , introduced by Minority Leader John Boehner , which would have substituted several sections of the health care bill dealing with insurance , did not pass .
Legislators voted against the amendment 258-176 .
The first amendment , introduced by anti-abortion Democrats , bans federal funds for abortion services in the public option and in the insurance " exchange " the bill would create .
Its consideration was considered a big win for them and for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , which used its power -- especially with conservative Democrats in swing congressional districts -- to help force other Democratic leaders to permit a vote that most of them oppose .
The prohibition , introduced by Democratic members , including Rep. Brad Ellsworth , D - Indiana , and Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Michigan , would exclude cases of rape , incest or if the mother 's life is in danger .
Republicans strongly supported the measure .
The GOP accounted for 174 of the votes in favor of the amendment , with 1 Republican voting " present . "
On the Democrats ' side , 64 voted for the measure , and 194 voted against .
Earlier Saturday , President Obama said members of the House of Representatives face the chance of a lifetime as they consider the legislation .
After a meeting with the House Democratic leadership , the president said he told lawmakers that " opportunities like this come around maybe once in a generation . "
" This is their moment , this is our moment , to live up to the trust that the American people have placed in us , " Obama told reporters in the White House rose garden .
" Even when it 's hard , especially when it 's hard , this is our moment to deliver . "

Not many years ago , there was n't enough wind power coming from the Great Plains to worry about .
Now there is , and lots of people are worrying .
A group of mostly East Coast utility companies calling itself the Coalition for Fair Transmission Policy fears that the prime conditions in the Great Plains will make the region 's wind power too cheap for its members to compete with , unless developers there are made to pay the costs of moving wind power eastward .
Influential natural gas producers and generators in Texas are worried .
They are demanding that the state 's wind developers share the costs of backup natural gas generators that must pick up the slack when the wind does n't blow .
The gas industry , threatened by state policies that promote wind power , is asking regulators to impose penalties on wind generators that can't deliver scheduled energy when the wind dies down .
And last week , four senators representing New York , Ohio , Montana and Pennsylvania proposed to deny federal clean energy grants to wind developers that buy blades , turbines and other components from abroad .
" It is a no - brainer that stimulus funds should only go to projects that create jobs in the United States rather than overseas , " Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) said , pointing at a proposed Texas wind farm whose backers include a Chinese power company .
Some renewable policy advocates say the problem has less to do with China and more with on - and - off - again federal energy policies , and arguments over how to pay for the vast expansion of transmission lines needed to maximize wind power delivery .
Instead of looking at foreign rivals , members of Congress should start with a look in the mirror , says this side in the debate .
" We 've had so many studies , " said Lisa Barton , vice president for transportation strategy and business development at Columbus , Ohio - based American Electric Power , a strong proponent of grid expansion .
" It 's 2010 , and yet we still do n't have a decision on how to move forward in connecting wind or in building a more robust transmission system . "
How ' American ' should the jobs be ?
The issue of allocating costs for new transmission lines among states and regions is one of the high hurdles ahead for the Senate , if it can get climate and energy legislation to the floor this spring .
The debate pits utilities and power generators in the North , Southwest and Pacific Northwest against companies like AEP that hope to move large amounts of competing wind power to the coasts .
Wind power development poses " a perceived threat to the embedded generators , " said David Corbus , senior engineer with the Energy Department 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory .
" They color it in different ways .
But when you come down to it , that 's the bottom line on a lot of these issues . "
Corbus was project manager for the NREL 's recently released 14 - month study of wind power .
" You can't ignore the interests of the folks involved in the debate , " Barton said .
Schumer and his three Democratic colleagues , Sherrod Brown of Ohio , Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Jon Tester of Montana , say new wind power projects receiving federal stimulus grants should use U.S. manufacturing -- some of which lies in their backyards .
" Companies located in New York , Pennsylvania , and elsewhere across the United States are fully capable of manufacturing the range of clean - energy components , " they said in a letter last week to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner .
Citing an American University study that reported foreign dominance of renewable energy grants , they proposed a moratorium on wind power grants from Treasury until the Senate can pass their " Buy America " legislation .
The American Wind Energy Association , backed by Energy Secretary Steven Chu , disputes the facts and conclusions by American University 's Investigative Reporting Workshop .
The wind industry employs 85,000 people , AWEA said .
" In three years , we went from two turbine manufacturers with facilities in the U.S. to nine , and four more have announced plans for factories here , " it added .
The AU study did not count foreign - owned clean energy manufacturing employment in the United States as " American " jobs , the association said .
" You do not want to stop these projects if two - thirds is American and one - third is foreign , " Chu said on Friday .
' Wind is getting curtailed '
AWEA executives say that policy delay is the real threat to the U.S. competitive position .
After strong expansion of wind power in the past two years , orders for the future are jeopardized by low natural gas prices , the recession 's impact and transmission bottlenecks .
If the U.S. wind sector plateaus , it risks losing technological leadership to European and Chinese rivals , AWEA says .
The current transmission system is too crowded already to deliver the wind power that exists today , Corbus notes .
" It 's a shame for wind [ generation ] to be curtailed , and that 's happening .
Wind is getting curtailed all over the place . "
The American Council on Renewable Energy ( ACORE ) also has opposed the senators ' proposal , arguing in a letter to Geithner , " We submit that the very reason the United States is falling behind the rest of the world is because the Congress has created on - again , off - again public policy regarding renewable energy . "
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory recently concluded that 38 U.S. states have the potential to generate at least 1,000 gigawatts of electricity from onshore wind power , in an updated analysis on its " Wind Powering America " site .
These include Midwestern states like Michigan , parts of New York abutting the Great Lakes , and eastern Maine .
Eastern and Great Lakes states may decide that it 's worth paying a little more in order to build their own wind projects , creating local jobs and boosting their tax base , said Ralph Izzo , chairman and CEOs of PSEG , the large New Jersey utility .
" I 'd like a shot at developing a project , " he said .
His company is one of 10 in the newly formed Coalition for Fair Transmission Policy , headed by Atlanta - based Southern Co. , whose region has among the poorest onshore wind power potential in the country .
The NREL wind integration study headed by Corbus concludes , however , that the most economical wind resources -- even when transmission costs are factored in -- are in the Great Plains .
Izzo and other members of the fair transmission coalition disagree .
Uncertainty is biggest barrier , industry officials say
Reaching a goal of 20 percent wind generation in 2024 would require construction of 10 inter-regional high - voltage lines spanning a total of nearly 22,700 miles , at a cost of $ 93 billion .
Such an ambitious goal wo n't be achieved under a business - as - usual approach , the study concluded .
" It 's super important because of all the jobs that will be launched , " said Corbus .
" If you do n't have the transmission , you do n't have the wind going in , and you 're going to have jobs lost . "
NREL also studied another option , in which aggressive wind development offshore and along the Great Lakes halves the number of long - distance transmission lines needed to maximize wind power delivery .
It 's not clear whether a state - by - state approach , including large amounts of offshore wind , can happen quickly enough to reach that 20 percent goal , NREL says .
It 's also not clear whether state political interests would ever allow the build - out of a big transmission overlay that would speed wind power deployment , or whether regions would agree to consolidate control over the grid , in order to maximize wind power 's impact .
Time matters , contend authors of an " Electrification Roadmap , " released last year , which charted a scenario for moving a large portion of the U.S. light - duty vehicle fleet from reliance on gasoline power to battery or hybrid power .
If 75 percent of the light - duty vehicle miles traveled in the United States were " electric " miles in 2040 , then oil consumption by that fleet would drop from more than 8 million barrels a day today to 2 million , with a corresponding decline in U.S. dependence upon foreign oil , that study says .
To reach that goal , however , the nation would have to hit a " tipping point " around 2020 with new transmission and charging infrastructure capable of serving a quarter of new car and light truck purchases .
" The No. 1 problem is that there 's no certainty about what future to plan for , " said Evan Wilcox , AEP 's manager of transportation business development .
" If we knew it would be a 20 percent renewable future , then your transmission would get built . "
X -ray apparently of Osayed Qadus 's skull showing a bullet lodged inside
The Israeli military has criticised its own soldiers for killing four young Palestinian demonstrators in the West Bank in March .
The Palestinians , one of whom was 15 years old , were shot in the space of 24 hours in two incidents near Nablus .
Israeli Defence Force commander Maj Gen Avi Mizrahi said the incidents were " an unnecessary operational occurrence with dire consequences " .
The IDF will now decide whether to take disciplinary action against soldiers .
X-ray
Mohammed Qadus , 15 , and Osayed Qadus , 20 , were killed during protests on 20 March in which stones were thrown at soldiers near an Israeli settlement .
Palestinian and human rights groups said the young men were killed with live ammunition .
They produced an X - ray image that appeared to show a bullet lodged in the skull of one of the victims .
The IDF initially denied the allegation , saying troops had been given clearance to use rubber coated anti-riot ammunition .
Tuesday 's report says the IDF were " unable to verify the autopsy " .
Later two men were killed near a military checkpoint .
The IDF investigation said the soldiers opened fire on one man who had attacked them with a broken bottle .
They shot a second man when he raised a sharp object after the first man was shot , the investigation said .
Maj Gen Mizrahi said commanders on the ground should have managed the situation differently and the second man was far away enough for them not to have had to open fire .
Palestinians say the account is false and the men were killed in an unprovoked attack .
The BBC's Tim Franks in Jerusalem says it is unusual for the Israeli army to criticise its soldiers this quickly and this openly .
Nick Clegg ‘s sudden forward sprint in the British elections has the political establishment in Britain in an uproar – and the Americans are suddenly noticing that they might have a slight problem on their hands .
As a symptom of the vast discontent of the English - speaking peoples , his surge in the polls – after a scintillating performance in the first debate – confirms a trend that began in the last US presidential election , and has apparently leaped the Atlantic to implant itself in British soil .
In Britain it is the year of the insurgent , as it was in America in 2008 – and yet that is where the similarities end , for the most part .
With Barack Obama , there was the appearance of change , but the reality soon proved to be quite different .
On the domestic front , the Obama administration has committed itself to the same corporatist policies as its predecessor , except for being more willing to use the instrument of the State to benefit its corporate and labor supporters .
In the realm of foreign policy , Obama – a candidate who rose to prominence on the strength of his criticisms of the Iraq war – is escalating the war in Afghanistan , starting a new war in Pakistan , and openly preparing to attack Iran .
Change ?
Not so much .
However , the Obama - ites rightly point out that , at least when it comes to foreign policy , Obama the candidate never did promise anything other than what he ’s delivering : sure he was against the Iraq war , but that ’s because he wanted to escalate the Afghan war and go into Pakistan , and said so during the campaign .
Obama ran as a committed interventionist , refusing to take an attack on Iran off the table , and emphasizing that he wanted to implement a " smarter " and stylistically more palatable — albeit no less energetic — brand of interventionism .
Clegg , on the other hand , is explicitly offering British voters a real alternative to the " Atlanticist " policies loyally upheld by " New " Labor and the Conservatives , and that is a foreign policy that puts Britain , and British interests , first .
He mocks the " lopsided asymmetrical " nature of the " special relationship , " and descries " subservience " to Washington .
His enemies characterize this as " anti-Americanism , " as Gordon Brown did repeatedly during Thursday ’s foreign policy debate , but as usual he misses the point : Clegg ’s not " anti - " anything , he ’s pro-British .
That is , he intends to implement a policy whereby the " default Atlanticism " that has dominated British foreign policy since the end of World War II — in which " every time a decision is made we have no choice but to follow the decisions made in the White House , " as he put it in his speech to Chatham House – is abandoned , and a new paradigm , Britain ’s national self - interest , is put in its place .
What this means , concretely , is that , under a Clegg government , Britain will cease to be a military appendage of the US .
Why is it , Clegg wants to know , that
" I find myself as the only leader of a political party asking the obvious question of whether we , as a country , should be spending 120 billion pounds over the next 20 years on the like for like replacement of the Cold War Trident Missile System ?
I think there is no case for a nuclear deterrent .
I certainly think there is no case for the like for like replacement for that system .
I believe one of the reasons there is a deafening silence on that issue is because that missile system is cemented by a sense of indebtedness to our American friends . "
The Trident system was a deterrent against the possibility of a Soviet attack – a threat that vanished twenty years ago .
Yet still it remains in place , supported by the British political establishment , both Labor and the Conservatives — a drain on valuable resources at a time when the nation can least afford it .
Clegg , in short , is talking sense , and that ’s the reason he ’s made this tremendous breakthrough : indeed , it is a radical idea to suggest that there is " no case for a nuclear deterrent , " and yet even those who might not completely agree with him are impressed to hear the subject being raised at all .
He ’s challenging people ’s assumptions , and making them think – that ’s what we used to recognize as the quality of leadership , before a stultifying groupthink began to dominate discourse on both sides of the Atlantic .
Another hot - button issue he is n’t afraid to speak out on is the rather touchy question of Israel ’s relationship with the West .
The moral outrage many in Britain felt at the horrific tactics employed by the Israelis in Gaza has been effectively and reasonably expressed by Clegg , who wrote :
" The past two weeks have been a telling indictment of the international community .
We have an outgoing US president sanctioning Israel ’s military response and an aching silence from the president - elect .
We have a European Union encumbered by clumsy decision - making and confused messages .
" And at home we have a prime minister talking like an accountant about aid earmarked for Gaza without once saying anything meaningful about the conflict ’s origins .
Gordon Brown , like Tony Blair , has made British foreign policy effectively subservient to Washington .
But waiting for a change of heart in Washington is intolerable given the human cost . "
Can you imagine the presidential candidate of a major party saying something similar in these United States ?
He ’d be pilloried on the editorial pages of the nation ’s newspapers , likened to that nutjob who attacked the Holocaust Museum , and harried by the pundits until he was forced to apologize – and still they ’d never forgive him .
Yet unconditional support for the policies of the current extremist Israeli government is neither in Britain ’s interests , nor our own .
Again , Clegg is talking unvarnished sense : the plight of the Palestinians , no better than that of the Jews in medieval Europe , is a constant source of anger in the Arab and Muslim worlds , and the prime recruiting tool for al - Qaeda and its allies .
In spite of all the sanctimonius assurances that Israel is our best friend in the Middle East , Tel Aviv ’s policies are hurting the West .
What ’s more , our rulers know all too well what a liability Israel has become – there ’s a reason why the Obama administration is so eager to settle the Palestinian question , and pronto .
Yet the Obama - ites lack the political will to defy the powerful Israel lobby , and find themselves caught between two forms of realism – in the area of pure policy , where realism demands a more even - handed approach , and in the domestic political arena , where realism ( or , perhaps , an inordinate caution ) dictates appeasing the lobbyists and the Israel Firsters .
Clegg , however , has no such compunctions , and he ’s taken the risk of having a high profile on a controversial issue because he sees a problem – for Britain , and for the world – that needs to be solved .
In that sense , he ’s a " pragmatist " in that he realizes one ca n’t be afraid to take a firm stance on an issue of such importance – because failure to solve the problem will have certain consequences , all of them unpleasant .
This hard - headed realism is some of what British voters find so attractive in Clegg , but there ’s more to his appeal .
In the second debate , he attacked the entrenched political class , characterizing them as distant from and insensitive to the needs of those they supposedly represent .
He attacked the other two parties for opposing political reforms such as the parliamentary recall , and the use of referendums to decide controversial issues , as a counterpoint to the increasingly rigid , stratified , and authoritarian style of British political life .
He also counterposed his own views on breaking up the " too big to fail " banks to those of New Labor and the Conservatives , both of whom are loyal servants of those powerful colossi .
Of course , as a libertarian , I can hardly endorse many of Clegg ’s " centrist " economic ideas , and some of his other views , but , unlike Brown and New Labor , both of which basically want to preserve the creaky and increasingly shaky British welfare state , the Liberal Democrats – who began as a right - wing split from the Labor party – are at least willing to admit that the old paradigm has had decidedly mixed results , at best .
In the context of severely straitened economic circumstances , it seems to me that the business - like no -nonsense problem - solving Clegg is more likely to be successful at actually cutting back the Brits ’ " cradle to grave " social welfarism – far more so than the wimpy , apologetic , " more - in - sorrow - than - anger " David Cameron , whose attempt to reinvent the Tories makes one nostalgic for Maggie Thatcher .
It was revealing to watch the supposedly " left - wing " Labor party candidate , the baggy and tired - looking Gordon Brown , accuse Clegg of being a " risk to our security , " and tout the Afghan war .
Yet Clegg is far from perfect on the Afghanistan issue , and there is always the chance that his protests to the effect that he is indeed an Atlanticist may turn out to be all too true .
In any case , however , Clegg ’s personal poltical fortunes and trajectory are n’t the point : what ’s important is that he is mining a rich lode of votes from those who are tired of hearing the same old homilies , and the same old demagoguery , and yearn for a real shift – a radical one – in the course being set for the ship of state .
That course has taken both Britian and the US through a ruinous series of wars , and now has us shipwrecked on the shoals of a global depression : no wonder people are turning to previously obscure political figures for leadership .
A Clegg victory will be a crushing blow to the Atlanticist alliance that has dominated the making of British foreign policy since Churchill ’s time .
Such a development has the capacity to transform the Anglo - American " special relationship " from one of a vassal serving a master to an alliance of equals .
You ca n’t blame the British people if they throw the bums out , no matter how ostensibly " pro-American " they may be : and , in any case , what every American should want is not unthinking , reflexive support for US government policies , but an ally who will tell us when he thinks our government has gone wrong , as in Iraq .
Instead , we had Tony Blair " sexing up " intelligence dossiers , and echoing whatever nonsense was coming out of Washington : that ’s not healthy , and it ’s beneath the dignity of the British people , who deserve far better than a poodle who barks at Washington ’s command .
That is n’t anti-Americanism : it ’s British nationalism , and it ’s common sense .
The Government of India has just introduced a major new copyright reform package .
Of particular note from a Canadian perspective are the approaches to fair dealing and anti-circumvention .
On fair dealing , the provision is expanded to cover " private and personal use . "
On anti-circumvention , the bill is consistent with implementing the WIPO Internet treaties in a manner that retains equal rights both online and offline .
The provision specifically targets circumvention for the purposes of copyright infringement and does not target the distribution or marketing of devices that can be used to circumvent .

Levi Johnston vs Sarah Palin for custody of Alaska
Levi's re-loading !
Levi Johnston , Sarah Palin 's grandbaby - daddy and the bane of her existence , is pitching his own docu-series in which HE will introduce viewers to Alaska .
The news comes just days after Discovery Networks announced that its TLC network would air " Sarah Palin 's Alaska " in which SHE would introduce us to Alaska .
Yes , TV is about to erupt in warring Palin - clan docu-series .
Life could not get better .
" If I could wave my magic wand I would want it to premiere at the exact same hour , minute , and second as Sarah Palin 's does , " Stuart Krasnow , the executive producer of Levi 's series , told The TV Column .
Levi's show , tentatively titled " Levi Johnston 's Final Frontier , " is " ' Jersey Shore ' on ice , " Krasnow said .
We , however , like to think of it as a much hotter " Ice Road Truckers . "
Levi and his pals " put jet fuel in their snowmobiles -- they trick them out , " the producer said .
" They drive Ford pickups .
They do n't go on the Internet often .
That 's what we 're interested in about him . "
Levi , who was foisted upon an unsuspecting public during the 2008 presidential campaign as the fiance of Bristol Palin and father of Bristol 's baby , was seen around Los Angeles Monday in an RV that had been gussied up to have " a party - bus kind of feel to it , " Krasnow says .
The aspiring reality TV star and his party - mobile were making stops at various cable networks 's offices to pitch a series that Krasnow hopes will be around eight episodes long -- just like Palin's .
Monday afternoon , the Johnston party wagon was parked outside MTV Networks ' offices in Santa Monica .
Krasnow , whose credits include " The Weakest Link , " would not confirm what other , non-MTV , networks were being pitched , other than to say they were all networks that target " younger - skewing networks " -- networks that attract " the type [ of viewer ] that would not watch TLC or Discovery . "
Exact details of Levi's show were being kept deliberately vague , so the project could be tailor - made to suit the purchasing network .
Mothership MTV network , for instance , might want to focus more on Levi 's first time on the dating scene in Alaska since breaking up with Bristol , whereas MTV's Spike network might want them to focus on what Krasnow called " the adrenaline activities he has in Alaska with his buddies . "
Hey , if it goes to CW , maybe we 'll see Levi nekkid on a bearskin rug .
And he 'll be really buff .
Oh , and a vampire .
" Levi Johnston 's Final Frontier " was not mounted in reaction to Palin 's show , Krasnow insisted , saying it was in the works before the former governor began shopping her program to the networks with executive producer Mark Burnett .
" He 's a 19 - year - old kid living a life like nobody else 's on the planet and in the culture of Alaska -- that interested us .
When Sarah Palin made her announcement , we rushed and decided to go out quicker .
In a competitive marketplace it made sense , if Sarah Palin is going to try to own Alaska , " Krasnow snarked .
" She may try to tell us how beautiful an iceberg is ..... his version might include skinning a bear . "
That said , Krasnow said he 's going to do a show " that 's authentic and real -- it 's not trying to just be some anti-Sarah Palin show .
That is not our motivation .
We 're showing Alaska through somebody else 's eyes -- the lives of real people in Alaska -- and throwing into the limelight a good guy who is poised and polite ; a good kid . "
But Bristol 's going to get the jump on them both .
She 's set to appear , playing herself , in an episode of ABC Family 's " The Secret Life of the American Teenager , " a series focused on teen pregnancy .
That episode will air either in late June or early July , an ABC Family rep told the TV Column , but there is no plan for Daddy Levi to appear .
Levi looked the model son- in - law when he was first introduced to the country at the Republican National Convention after Palin 's campaign confirmed that Bristol , then 17 , was five months pregnant with his child .
This continued until about two months after their son Tripp 's birth in December of 2008 , when the couple split .
Few things in their world are more painful than the realization that an estrangement has occurred between a former future son- in - law and his ex future mother - in - law .
In December , Johnston asked that in December the custody case between him and Bristol over baby Tripp be conducted in public to protect himself from Sarah Palin , who he said was " powerful , politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive . "
Palin went on Oprah Winfrey 's show and spoke of Levi's " aspiring porn " career ( he did shoots for Playgirl and GQ ) , saying , " I believe he goes by the name Ricky Hollywood now , " and adding that she prays for him .
What a coincidence -- so did we !
And now it appears our prayers have been answered .
Most people do not really think about their credit score much .
In fact , you might be one of them .
The only time it really comes into play for you is when you go to apply for a loan , credit card , or other types of financial services .
You might not even know what your particular score means , but we can assure you that it is important .
Your actual score plays a significant role in determining whether or not you get approved for a loan and your eventual interest rate if you do .
This is why it is so important that you have a pulse on what your credit score actually is .
Here are three reasons why this is true .
Be Able To Spot Fluctuations and Errors
If you begin to regularly check your credit score , you will notice that it changes somewhat almost every month .
That is to be expected , even if you have not used any credit during that time .
It is how the algorithms that go into determining an individual ’s credit score actually works in the end .
However , checking your score regularly can allow you to spot wild fluctuations that should not be there .
This could indicate an error on your credit report , at which point you would want to have that checked out and rectified if need be .
Catch Identify Theft Before It Is Too Late
When you check your credit score , you will notice if new accounts have been opened , late payments made , and more .
If you notice that does not correspond to any activity you have recently done in relation to your credit , then it is an indication that somebody else has been or is currently using your credit profile .
This is serious and can wreck your ability to gain credit in the future .
It could send bill collectors your way , and the hassle of clearing your name could last for months or years in some cases .
Discover Where You Need Improvement
You might be wanting to discover ways to improve your creditworthiness .
Increasing your credit score is a primary way to do this .
Checking your score will provide you with certain indicators about where you need to focus on .
You can begin work towards rectifying those issues and then check your progress month after month .
Once your score begin to go up into the range that you are looking for , then you can begin to apply for the types of loans that you have been looking for .
These three reasons alone highlight just how important it is to check your credit score on a frequent basis .
It will fluctuate whether you keep an eye on it or not .
You do not want to let it go too long without checking it , as doing so can adversely impact your ability to get credit in the future .
Knowing what it should be enables you to spot abnormalities in your report early on and work to get them correct before they cause you damage .…

The scenario is all too common — children who are abused develop an attachment to their abuser that interferes with their desire to seek help or leave the situation .
Experts have struggled to understand this seemingly destructive behavior , but the underlying causes have remained hidden .
Now new research from scientists who study attachment in rats offers insight into what may be happening in abused children ’s brains .
Rats are especially responsive to smells during infancy , which may help foster the parental bond .
Psychologist Regina M. Sullivan of New York University showed in 2000 that young rats are drawn to almost any odor , even when the odor is associated with a stressful stimulus , such as a mild heat shock .
In other words , baby rats are attracted to the very thing that hurts them , rather than being repelled as older rats would be .
What is happening in the young rats ’ brains to foster attachment instead of aversion or fear ?
In a new paper in Nature Neuroscience , Sullivan and Gordon Barr , a psychologist at the Chil­dren ’s Hospital of Philadelphia , found the answer in the rats ’ amygdala , a brain region associated with anxiety and fear .
In the amygdala of rats attracted to the aversive odors , there were lower than normal levels of the neurotrans­mitter dopamine .
This lack of dopamine activity may have turned off their brain ’s fear response , enabling attraction to take place instead .
A similar mechanism may occur in abused children , Sullivan says , although how much the amygdala is involved with early human attachment is un­clear .
Barr suggests this behavior probably evolved as a survival tactic .
“ The animal has to be able to survive , which means it has to be attached to its caregiver no matter what the quality of care , ” he says .
Australian actress Mia Wasikowska 's portrayal of Alice in Wonderland has been savaged by a British movie critic , who says she " looks like she 's on heroin " .
News of The World critic Robbie Collin gave the Tim Burton blockbuster just one star in his column on Sunday , describing the 3D film as one that should be burned and fired off into space .
On Wasikowska 's performance , Collin wrote that " there 's not been a lead character this paper - flat since the South Park movie " .
Google has kept a promise it made last year :
Site speed is now a ranking factor in Google ’s algorithm , and is already in place for U.S. searchers .
But Google also cautions web site owners not to sacrifice relevance in the name of faster web pages , and even says this new ranking factor will impact very few queries .
More on that below , but first the background on today ’s announcement from Google Fellow Amit Singhal and Matt Cutts , head of Google ’s web spam team .
Why Page Speed Matters
The first warning that site speed was on Google ’s radar came last November , when Cutts said there was “ strong lobbying ” inside Google to account for site speed as a new ranking factor .
Speaking at SMX
West last month , Google ’s Maile
Ohye showed a slide indicating that delays of under a half - second impact business metrics .
In addition to the numerous studies over the years that show Internet users prefer fast pages , Singhal says Google ran its own testing on how users respond to page speed , including experiments on Google.com .
Singhal and Cutts point to a June 2009 blog post on the Google Research Blog that talked about how Google purposely slowed down its search results to measure the impact on search behavior .
Our experiments demonstrate that slowing down the search results page by 100 to 400 milliseconds has a measurable impact on the number of searches per user of - 0.2 % to - 0.6 % ( averaged over four or six weeks depending on the experiment ) .
That ’s 0.2 % to 0.6 % fewer searches for changes under half a second !
“ When we slow our own users down [ on Google.com ] , we see less engagement , ” Singhal says .
“ Users love fast sites .
A faster web is a good thing all around . ”
How Google Measures Page Speed
Singhal says there are two primary ways
Google will measure page speed :
How a page responds to Googlebot Load time as measured by the Google Toolbar
In December , Google added a page speed report to Webmasters Tools in the “ Labs ” section .
The report shows how fast your site loads , specifically calls out several pages on your site , and offers suggestions to improve page speed .
Where Page Speed Fits in Google ’s Algorithm
Google ’s algorithm has about 200 different ranking factors , and even though Google is taking the unusual step of publicly announcing a new factor , Cutts says site owners should n’t overestimate the impact of page speed on rankings .
“ Quality should still be the first and foremost concern [ for site owners ] , ” Cutts says .
“ This change affects outliers ; we estimate that fewer than 1 % of queries will be impacted .
If you ’re the best resource , you ’ll probably still come up . ”
Singhal says the focus remains on improving the user experience on Google.com , and the company ca n’t do that if it gets the relevance of search results wrong .
“ We want to return faster sites , ” he says , “ but not at the expense of relevance . ”
Final Thoughts
Page speed is in place now as a ranking factor on Google.com , and has been for a couple weeks .
If your site was going to be impacted , it probably would ’ve happened already .
Google plans to monitor the results of this change and eventually expand the use of page speed as a ranking factor in other countries .
One last note : Google says this ranking change has no relation to its upcoming Caffeine rollout , which is about how Google indexes the web , not how it ranks pages .

Palin ’s Debate Answers Were Scripted
The false narrative of Palin as a viable VP contender is further unveiled this morning as Steve Schmidt ( aka , the Bullet ) reveals Palin ’s debate answers were memorized and scripted .
Why would one have to have scripted answers if one were qualified , especially given the format the McCain campaign pushed for and won : According to the New York Times , this arrangement was more restrictive than the two - minute - response , five - minutes - of - open - discussion format of the first McCain - Obama debate , because the looser “ format could leave Ms. Palin , a relatively inexperienced debater , at a disadvantage and largely on the defensive . ” ”
God forbid Palin who was running for VP be put at a disadvantage for having to speak for five minutes on a subject– that ’s veering dangerously far from bumper sticker land .
After all , it was only our country ’s fate at stake .

What ’s the difference between a Palin debate and a movie ?
Not much apparently .
Sure , American politicians sell a cult of personality , but must it be so disingenuous as to include main characters like W and Palin ?
Ca n’t the GOP find someone who can read ?
Are n’t candidates supposed to have some ideas , something they stand for and should n’t they be able to discuss that topic without memorizing answers ?
Watch this mornings interview with Schmidt here :
“ In an exclusive interview with Sky News , Steve Schmidt , nicknamed The Bullet , says her preparations were going so badly in the days leading up to the debate with the vastly more experienced Joe Biden , the campaign was facing an “ emergency ” and a “ crisis ” .
He told her : “ These are the questions .
Here ’s what he ’s going to say .
Here ’s what your most effective response is .
That we want to be able to come out of this debate saying you were on offence . ”
“ If you hear ‘ A ’ , you go ahead and say ‘ B ’ , and so to that degree it was somewhat scripted , ” he admitted .
“ The questions that we mocked and drilled in the practice debates were within a degree or two of the questions that ( moderator ) Gwen Ifell asked during the debate . ”
Having memorized answers , one should have expected a result much better than what we got – shout outs to third graders and “ can I call you Joe ’s ” as a way of getting around Palin ’s inability to remember Biden ’s last name was not “ O’ Biden ” .
Yes , it really was that bad , Dorothy .
And yes , our media covered it as if it were a toss up re who won .
Sigh .
Here ’s a few reminders of the debate courtesy of NY Times transcript :
“ PALIN : John McCain , in referring to the fundamental of our economy being strong , he was talking to and he was talking about the American workforce ….
( Oh boy , I ’d forgotten this moment of Riotous Revisionism )
Now , what I ’ve done as a governor and as a mayor is ( inaudible ) I ’ve had that track record of reform .
And I ’ve joined this team that is a team of mavericks with John McCain , also , with his track record of reform , where we ’re known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done .
… But I think Americans are craving something new and different and that new energy and that new commitment that ’s going to come with reform ( which they can only get from the Democrats ) .
IFILL : Now , let ’s talk about — the next question is to talk about the subprime lending meltdown …
PALIN : Again , John McCain and I , that commitment that we have made , and we ’re going to follow through on that , getting rid of that corruption …( insert Joe Hockey mom populist shout out here ) .
We need to make sure that we demand from the federal government strict oversight of those entities in charge of our investments ….
( Oversight is regulation , which is a Democratic principle , not a Republican principle … these are the same oversights she is now calling bad )
BIDEN : … but if you notice , Gwen , the governor did not answer the question about deregulation , did not answer the question of defending John McCain about not going along with the deregulation , letting Wall Street run wild .
He did support deregulation almost across the board .
That ’s why we got into so much trouble .
IFILL : Would you like to have an opportunity to answer that before we move on ?
PALIN : … Now , as for John McCain ’s adherence to rules and regulations and pushing for even harder and tougher regulations , that is another thing that he is known for though . ”
( Lie to me , I promise , I ’ll believe ; Yes , old Johnny is KNOWN for regulations in the alternate reality known as Palinland . )
IFILL : So , Governor , as vice president , there ’s nothing that you have promised as a candidate that you would — that you would n’t take off the table because of this financial crisis we ’re in ?
PALIN : There is not .
And how long have I been at this , like five weeks ?
So there has n’t been a whole lot that I ’ve promised , except to do what is right for the American people , put government back on the side of the American people , stop the greed and corruption on Wall Street .
( yes , my little real merkicans , it will cost you nothing to deal with the financial debacle !
Razzle , dazzle , free gifts from the socialist governor !
Promises cost nothing ! )
And the rescue plan has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and deserving .
And I do n’t believe that John McCain has made any promise that he would not be able to keep , either . ”
( Oversight you say ?
Exactly where is your support for oversight today , Sister ?
How did Biden not laugh out loud at this absurdity ?
McCain has deregulation tattooed on his forehead for god ’s sake … “ a nation of whiners “ … )
Yes , that would be that same reform that Palin is now suggesting is not necessary and is “ crony capitalism ” ( projections r us ) , but this is what you get when you hire a puppet who stands for nothing other than parochial Poujadism via memorized or hand - palmed most expedient talking points of the moment .
Upon returning to the campaign trail after her debate preparation , Palin stepped up her attacks on now President Barack Obama .
At a fundraising event , Palin explained her new aggressiveness , saying , “ There does come a time when you have to take the gloves off and that time is right now . ”
Uh huh .
Like when , say , you are a drag on the ticket and you flub even your interview with Fox Wolf Guard Sean Hannity ?
“ The new attack mode may be a political necessity for a ticket that has fallen behind with voters .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain trails in national polls by Gallup and Rasmussen by numbers that are outside the margin of error . ”
Kinda like the old distraction game , eh , Palin ?
According to Schmidt in an earlier interview , Palin had a breakdown preparing for the debate , so her response is to come back attacking harder .
Palin always points her fingers outward in now predictable form of projection and she does it while lying about what she stands for .
Palin is now against “ reform ” , regulation , and oversight but she sure sold that snake oil “ hockey mom I ’m one of you ” Main street - isms to the people during the winkfest known as the VP debate .
The problem is n’t that she needed to memorize certain names or tough to recall terms , the problem is that she memorized answers because she had no idea what the issues were .
She had and has no idea what she was promising , what she stood for , what any of it meant .
She did n’t even know that McCain was not for regulations .
She actually believed he was pro-regulations and she sold that to her Cult .
She had no idea what she was saying ; perhaps she barely managed to memorize Schmidt ’s answers to tough questions like “ what do you and McCain stand for ? ” , much as she had to look at her hand to see the top three agenda items for a conservative .
And now the GOP is selling her as a possible presidential candidate .
Are you ready for your close up , Mrs. Palin ?

Is a missile launcher / shotgun combo worth $ 2 to you ?
Visible - frequency wireless works by flickering all the lights in a room ever so slightly -- so slightly , in fact , that the human eye could never detect it .
Incandescent and fluorescent bulbs can't flicker fast enough , so the scheme does require LED lighting , but the connection does n't require any kind of specialized fixture , just commercial LEDs .
And , though standard LEDs also have a limited bandwidth , the researchers were able to expand that bandwidth drastically by filtering out all but the blue light .
In some areas of Uzbekistan any Christian meeting is deemed illegal even to throw a birthday party or hold a soup kitchen .
Judges and police pursue Christians with seizures and exorbitant fines for having prayed together .
Permitted by a law banning everything that is not authorized .
Tashkent ( AsiaNews / F18 ) - Police raids during prayer meetings , threats , costly fines , confiscation and destruction of religious material and even religious texts .
In many regions of Uzbekistan the systematic persecution of Christians by police and authorities continues , " guilty " of meeting in private homes to pray together to the point that even a birthday party is considered an " illegal meeting " .
Persecution is increasing in the north - western region of Karakalpakstan .
Forum 18 news agency reports that on 8 April in Nukus , the capital of Karakalpakstan , the police questioned the Protestant Aimurat Khayburahmanov and asked him to sign a declaration that he will not meet with other Christians and does not have Christian books at home .
Upon his refusal , he was threatened with prosecutin .
Khayburahmanov had already spent three months in jail for " teaching religion without permission " and was released through an amnesty in September 2008 .
Local sources report that many Christians have been threatened in a similar way under Article .
244- 3 of the Penal Code , which punishes with imprisonment for up to three years the " illegal production , possession , importation and distribution of religious literature . "
They complain that the police carries out thorough raids for religious literature , and that once they come across it the report the owner , even though at times the police themselves plant the texts in the homes of Christians and then report them for possession ” .
The religious books are later confiscated and burnt .
Students in the region are kept under close watch and told to not get involved with " foreign religions , extremist influences and low level cultures of mass " .
Those who do , risk being expelled from school and art .
240 Part 2 of the Administrative Code can be applied , which prohibits " attracting believers of a confession to another ( proselytism ) and other missionary activities . "
For 2010 various meetings with young people have been organised , to explain to them the evil influence of foreign religions .
Christians are affected even if they organize football or basketball matches or any other mass gathering or social activity .
On April 10 , police interrupted a meeting of young Protestants in the village of Baraja , Bostanlik District , Tashkent .
On the arrival of many young police was playing football or basketball .
The officers led 43 participants and organizers to the barracks , taking their photographs and fingerprints .
Many of them , like as Alexander Lokshev were punished for taking part in an unauthorized mass event and charged with having held a religious activity .
On the afternoon of April 12 , police inspected the premises of the Protestant Church of Eternal Life Tahskent , Yakkasarai district , where the faithful have a canteen for the poor and homeless .
Those present were interrogated ; the pastor and others were taken to police headquarters and charged with having held an unauthorised activity “ not in conformity with their statute ” .
In practice , any meeting of the faithful can be punished .
Also in Tashkent Surgeli district , 10 Pentecostals were reported on March 10 for an illegal meeting , for having gathered to celebrate a birthday .
The 10 - 8 of them pensioners - were sentenced to fines of about 100 times the average monthly wage .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has made an startling revelation today :
The US has long - range missiles armed with high - power - but - non - nuclear explosives ready for a global strike .
The ( big ) problem : China and Russia wo n't be able to distinguish between nuclear and non-nuclear ICBMs .

This is what Gates said , talking on NBC's Meet the Press :
We have , in addition to the nuclear deterrent today , a couple of things we did n't have in the Soviet days …
And we have prompt global strike affording us some conventional alternatives on long - range missiles that we did n't have before .

Defense Tech 's Greg Grant says that maybe Gates meant to say " we will soon have " , but he also points out that the Navy has been working on conventional explosive D - 5 Trident II missiles for " at least a decade " now .
This development was funded through the Trident program — the program 's production line is still open — without the direct approval of Congress .
The concern about this kind of weapon is that China , Russia , and other nuclear powers wo n't be able to detect the nature of the ICBM with their early - warning systems .
For them , on a computer screen , all inter-continental ballistic missiles look just like the same .
Even if the US President called each of the nuclear nations , I doubt that such a launch would be observed without serious concerns .
An ICBM launched from California to North Korea or Iran would look very dangerous for both China and Russia , no matter what an US President is saying over the phone .

On top of that potential nuclear power ruckus , the fact is that a ballistic missile loaded with conventional explosives is not a very effective weapon .
ICBMs are dumb weapons designed to reach a target area , spread their nuclear heads , and wipe everything around , completely , over a large blast radious .
By loading ICBMs with explosives — no matter how powerful they may get — your destruction power is very low , while keeping a very low accuracy .
So basically , a launch of this type of missile may not reach its target , and make people with actual nuclear ICBMs very pissed off .
Sounds like a lose - lose situation to me .

Moebius syndrome is the name given to facial paralysis , and is characterized by an individual who is incapable of expressing their emotions or any kind of reaction through their face because of it .
It is a rare congenital condition that only affects about 1 in 100,000 children at birth .
Moebius syndrome typically results in total or near total paralysis of the face , including eyes that do n’t blink .
The New York Times has the story of researcher Kathleen Bogart , who was disappointed to learn of the dearth of psychological research into this condition .
Having it herself , she decided to help fill the gap , and began researching people with Moebius syndrome .
In a new study , the largest to date of Moebius syndrome , Ms. Bogart and David Matsumoto , a psychologist at San Francisco State , found that people with the disorder , whatever their social struggles , had no trouble at all recognizing others ’ expressions .
They do just as well as anyone else in identifying emotions in photographed faces , despite having no way to mimic .
The findings strongly suggest that the brain has other systems to recognize facial expressions , and that people with facial paralysis learn to take advantage of those .
Typical social interactions , including everyday conversations , can be difficult for people with Moebius syndrome , since the person interacting with the individual with Moebius syndrome is n’t getting any facial feedback .
Such feedback is often a mirror of our own reactions to the topic of conversation , which we express in our eyes and face .
When you ’re talking about a funny story , I ’ll look at you with wider eyes and a smile ready to break into a chuckle or full blown laugh as you get to the punch line .
It ’s the natural give - and - take of our social interactions .
However , for someone with Moebius syndrome , there ’s none of that .
Their face is a stone wall , expressing nothing .
As Ms. Bogart says , “ A lack of facial expression can result in people being perceived as dull , unhappy , or disinterested . ”
You can imagine how challenging an ordinary conversation may be with such a person .
The results do not imply that socializing is easy or natural for people with such paralysis ; most do struggle , Ms. Bogart and Dr. Matusmoto found in a follow - up study .
The main reason for this ( beyond the immobile features , which distract some people ) has little to do with a deficit in recognizing emotions in others , the studies suggest .
It most likely comes back to mimicry , or the lack thereof .
In a series of studies , psychologists have found that social bonding between conversation partners is highly dependent on a rhythmic and usually subconscious give and take of gestures and expressions that creates a kind of shared good will .
“ Part of that could be the buying in on the interaction itself , ” Dr. Chartrand said .
If the timing is not just right — the Moebius study did not account for timing — then the buy - in can feel uncertain , and interaction fizzles .
The way that many people with complete , or near complete , paralysis overcome this problem is by relying on channels other than the face : eye contact , hand gestures , posture and voice tone .
Many people with paralysis can make that expressive instrument as subtle and potent as a string section
This is fascinating research that helps us learn and understand more about the subtle communications that occur when we interact with one another .
It also helps us better understand the brain , and how it compensates and then adapts for these kinds of deficiencies with other strategies to impart similar , important non-verbal information .
It ’s amazing to see the brain adapt in the way the article describes , and reminds us that it is a dynamic , flexible organ — not some hunk of stone set at birth with pre-defined limits .
And kudos to Kathleen Bogart for pursuing research into this phenomenon and figure out , as she notes on her web page , “ how reduced facial movement affects social interaction , and how to facilitate emotional communication in people with facial movement disorders .
An additional goal of this research is to identify effective verbal and nonverbal communication strategies that people with facial movement disorders use to enhance communication . ”
Excellent goals that may help us better understand not only people who have facial paralysis , but also all of the facial behaviors that go into everyday social interactions .

Say you have some life - altering product that needs advertising to get off the ground , using Google TV Ads , you can buy TV ad space whenever / wherever you want .
Slate tested it out , and the results were surprising .

Deciding to create an ad for absolutely nothing , along with a website to go along with that ad , they were able to buy space for $ 100 in the wee hours of the morning during repeats of The Glenn Beck Show .
And they got over 1,000 people to go to this completely made - up website that was about absolutely nothing .
Sure , the only people that went to the website were polishing their gun in their underwear at 3 in the morning , but they went !
So what does this mean for advertising ?
I 'm no advertiser , but it means that if you have $ 100 , a flip cam , and a desire to be on TV , you can do it .
I always thought more people needed to see me dancing sensually in my underwear to Fleetwood Mac , and now I have the proper outlet for it .
Sweet .

Over the years , the game and the rules have remained virtually unchanged even though the outer packaging has gone through many revisions and speciality editions - covering topics as varied as dogs , sports teams and movies .
IT EMERGED from a blazing light in the clouds , descending on a busy street before zipping off silently into the sunset .
Just what - or who - propelled the strange flying disc across Sydney 's skyline may never be known .
But while the close encounter was over in seconds , it was enough to convince mother - of - two Fiona Hartigan that she 'd just seen a UFO .
And she has the photos to prove it .
Ms Hartigan yesterday said she had just got out of her car on Sunday evening to snap a few sunset photos when the amazing events began .
" As I was about to take the picture this black object appeared and then it started to move , " she said .
" It started off about 800 m away but it came closer - to about 400 m - and then two other little round things appeared from this bright orange light above .
" There was no noise .
It was calm and peaceful but it was very weird . "
Ms Hartigan said the main UFO then shot off above Governor Macquarie Drive at Chipping Norton , with the smaller UFOs zipping away in the opposite direction .
" I do n't know how to explain it - I 'm still totally bewildered , " she said .
To the sceptic , Ms Hartigan 's photo might show a speck of dust on the lens or something small floating in the air close to the camera .
But close encounters like Ms Hartigan 's came as no surprise to UFO Research NSW spokesman Doug Moffett :
" It could be some electrical anomaly that no one has ever seen , it could be an extra - terrestrial craft , it could be something else , " he said .
" There does appear to be a blur around the image , which could just be the way it 's shaped , or - and this is pure speculation - it could be due to its propulsion system .
" Whatever the case , it 's an opportunity to learn something new . "
Mr Moffett said there were between 1000 and 1500 UFO sightings in Australia every year , " but that is just the tip of the iceberg " .
" Why would anyone make these stories up ?
They are setting themselves up for ridicule , " he said .

The West Virginia miners killed in an April 5 explosion " lived as they died , in pursuit of the American Dream , " President Obama plans to say at a memorial service in West Virginia .
Here are excerpts from Obama 's remarks , as released by the White House :
All the hard work .
All the hardship .
All the time spent underground .
It was all for their families .
For a car in the driveway .
For a roof overhead .
For a chance to give their kids opportunities they never knew ; and enjoy retirement with their wives .
It was all in the hopes of something better .
These miners lived -- as they died -- in pursuit of the American Dream .
In the days following the disaster , emails and letters poured into the White House .
Postmarked from different places , they often begin the same way : " I am proud to be from a family of miners , " " I am the son of a coal miner , " " I am proud to be a coal miner 's daughter . "
They ask me to keep our miners in my thoughts .
Never forget , they say , miners keep America 's lights on .
Then , they make a simple plea : do n't let this happen again .
We can not bring back the 29 men we lost .
They are with the Lord now .
Our task , here on Earth , is to save lives from being lost in another such tragedy .
To do what must be done , individually and collectively , to assure safe conditions underground .
To treat our miners the way they treat each other -- like family .
For we are all family .
We are Americans .

I 'm no fan of Bart Stupak ( D - MI ) , but there 's no way any Representative should be threatened the way he was .
These are messages left on his voice mail , left by supposed Christians and supporters of " life " .
CBS News reports :
" Congressman Stupak , you baby - killing mother f***er ... I hope you bleed out your a** , got cancer and die , you mother f***er , " one man says in a message to Stupak .
" There are millions of people across the country who wish you ill , " a woman says in a voicemail , " and all of those thoughts that are projected on you will materialize into something that 's not very good for you . "
CBS
News also obtained copies of faxes sent to Stupak , which include racial epithets used in reference to President Obama and show pictures of nooses with Stupak 's name .
I think Stupak 's injection of the abortion issue into the debate was a low - life thing to do .
I support his primary challenger , Connie Saltonstall .
Still , listen to the dripping hatred in these people 's voices , the implied threat of their words .
There is no place for this in our politics , even against those who play games with wedge issues and bow to Catholic bishops .
The thing is , in this country we elect people .
We get to vote every couple of years or so .
Violence is for dictatorships , not democracies .
Like it or not , they 're not going to turn the US into Teabagistan , no matter how hard they wish it , or how nasty they get .
A recent detailed analysis of the composition of US Federal debt has made us question just how much dry powder the Fed has left to manipulate interest rates .
We ignore all tangential issues such as what the end of QE will mean on MBS , and by implication 10 Year , rates , and focus purely on the structural composition of the curve , which leads us to some very troubling observations .
In summary : the Treasury is running out of time in which to orchestrate a massive rush away from risky assets into the sweet spot for UST interest rates : risk - free Bill holdings .
In other words , a stock market crash is long - overdue if the Treasury does not want to face a major spike in rates and drop in Treasury demand in the immediate future .
First , and this is no surprise to anyone , the US is on collision course with an unmitigated funding disaster .
As the chart below demonstrates , the US has been issuing roughly $ 147 billion a month for the past 17 months , in a period in which total US Federal debt has increased from $ 10 trillion to $ 12.6 trillion .
With recently passed healthcare reform , look for the red line indicating total debt to go increasingly exponential .
Like we said , nothing surprising here as we spend ourselves into bankruptcy .
The only reason why this has not escalated yet has been the Fed 's ability to keep rates low on the short end , translating into modest low long - end rates as well , despite the curve being at record wides .
The progression over time of average interest rates by Bills , Notes and Bonds , as presented by Treasury Direct , is shown below .
This should also not come as much of a surprise , as it has been well known that the Fed 's only prerogative in the past two years has been to buy every yielding security in sight to keep rates low .
Now where it gets quite interesting is an analysis of the composition of the total components of the debt , on a relative basis .
The chart below demonstrates the amount of various pieces of debt by tenor as well as the inclusion of non-marketable debt and trust funds held by the Treasury .
Recreating the chart above , but focusing exclusively on Marketable debt , yields the following chart :
We wrote recently that while China may or may not be bailing on US debt , one thing that is certain is that it is not rolling , and in fact may well be selling , its Bill exposure , i.e. , short - term Treasuries that mature within a year .
Indeed , the recent scramble away from Bills is confirmed by the prior two charts which indicate that the portion of Bills as percentage of total marketable debt has fallen from 30.1 % in February 2009 to just 21.8 % in February 2010 .
The reason for this is that the Fed had been previously posturing that it is attempting to push the average debt maturity from 4 to 6 years and over .
In order to do this the Fed needs to issue less net Bills .
And therein lies the rub .
As rates have fallen , the average interest on Bills has dropped from 1.4 % in October to essentially zero over the past several months ( 0.2 % to be precise ) .
In effect , the Treasury gets the benefit of holding $ 1.7 trillion in debt which pays no interest .
Yet as its rolls out of Bills , its ability to take the implicit benefit of the Fed 's ZIRP disappears .
As the Fed 's monetary policy impacts most of the the interest rate on Bills , with Bonds and Notes much more a function of medium - and long - term inflation / deflation expectations ( and with the yield curve at record levels , the expectations see some less than smooth sailing down the line ) , as the Treasury rolls down its Bill holdings , as it has been doing , the Fed 's ability to influence rates is getting progressively less and less .
Couple this with an ever increasing record amount of total US debt , and you have a recipe for disaster , or as we call it , the curve Black Swan .
In fact this can be seen in the chart below : a comparison of average blended interest rates , and overall ( accrued ) implied monthly interest , demonstrates that even as the blended interest rate has dropped to an all time low of 2.57 % , the actual annualized cash out on marketable debt ( excluding the Trust Fund shell game ) , has returned to levels last seen in December 2008 , of about $ 204 billion per month .
The last time the annualized interest was this high , the actual interest rate was 3.2 % , or 60 bps higher !
Furthermore , even as rates have been declining , actual interest expense has been increasing consistently since May of 200 ( and all this even as the actual blended interest rate is at an inflection point : it will likely trough in the mid 2.5 % range as the low hanging Bill fruit has been plucked away ) .
The reason for this : 1 ) rates on Bills can only go 0.2 % lower before hitting zero , and 2 ) nobody wants Bills anymore .
China certainly has been selling Bills , and US citizens , balking at money market rates , are definitely not going to lock their money into Bills which yield the same if not less .
The Treasury 's natural response - bringing back the SFP 56 - Day Cash Management Bills back .
Today , the Treasury auctioned off the 5th $ 25 billion SFP chunk , on its way to filling up the $ 200 billion CMB tank full .
Yet this is merely a stop - gap measure , and it is responsible for the slight bump higher in February Bill holdings compared to January .
Alas , the Treasury will need to generate wholesale interest for Bills in some way in the near future , or else it will drown itself in the vicious cycle combination of increasing interest payments pushing rates higher , etc .
And what creates a scramble for Bills better than anything ?
Why a massive market crash of course .
Are we predicting one will happen ?
Of course not ; in this market what is expected to happen is that last thing that will happen .
We merely point out the logic and what the empirical evidence is demonstrating .
Either the Treasury will need to expand the SFP program to far beyond the $ 200 billion cap , or it will need to get rates on Notes and Bills even lower at a time when the broader market is already expecting a rise in Rates .
And in the meantime , it will continue issuing roughly $ 150 - 200 billion in debt each and every month to fund in increasingly bankrupt government .
What we can predict with certainty , is that the Treasury is on an inevitable collision course with insolvency , courtesy of a government run amok .
And absent a major shift in capital out of risky assets into risk - free equivalents , it is going to get increasingly more difficult to control the runaway beast of rabid and uncontrollable deficit spending .
Introduction
I 've worked building tools and engines for artists making games and visual effects for more than ten years , and I 've always been baffled by the distinction that people make between " programmer art " and " real game art " .
Also , I 've noticed that the only people who will give you a free pass for bad programmer art are other programmers .
Regardless of how fun your game is , or how technically awesome your tech demo is , the non-programmers you show it to are going to think :
Is that a jetpack or a tumor ?
Often , you can find a way to generate good art without having to create it from scratch .
Mason McCuskey offers some excellent suggestions for sources of game art in his article " Creating Good Game Art When You 're Not An Artist " .
But sometimes , you just have to create your art from scratch .
Budgetary restrictions or game contest rules , or simply a tight deadline for a prototype might require you to set down the figurative slide - rule and pick up a paintbrush .
But I can't draw ... really ..
I mean , look at this :
If that 's what your programmer art looks like , this article is for you .
I thought I 'd share a set of tips for making better programmer art .
These tips are intended to be useful to anyone , regardless of artistic ability or experience .
While tips like " practice sketching everyday " or " visit an art museum " might be useful for the aspiring game artist , this document is meant for the non-artist , how to trick people into thinking that you -- the left - brained , code - writing , math - loving programmer -- have some artistic ability .
In addition , none ( mostly ) of these tips require " practice " , because , while practice is useful and even essential to being a true artist , it always seems like the your deadline is coming up with the sunrise and you just need some damn sprites .
Some of this is aimed at Photoshop users , because that 's what I know , but the same concepts apply to any paint program , and there are equivalent operations to everything I mention here in the Gimp , and probably in whatever package you use .
This is also aimed at participants in LudumDare or similar contests where you try to create a game from scratch in 48 - hours .
My compo games tend to fare well in the graphics category ( alas , killer gameplay continues to elude me ) , even though I do n't consider myself a particularly good game artist .
Many of these example come from my LD entries , and much of this experience is stuff I learned by doing these contests and being forced to generate art with an insane deadline .
Moreover , they should be valuable to anyone trying to produce quality art ( or some approximation thereof ) with a short schedule or limited budget .
Tip # 1 : Start with a Color Palette
The is the most common mistake I see , and the easiest to avoid .
The default palette for most paint programs hearkens back to the DOS days ( can you find the connection between the colors in this palette and the four - bit binary numbers from 00 to 15 ?
Of course you can .
If you could n't figure that out , you 'd be a real artist . )
By palette , I do n't mean a 16 or 256 color palette from the VGA days .
I simply mean a coordinated color scheme for your game .
If you start with a well chosen palette first thing , your scribbles will appear aesthetically pleasing and even intentionally " graphic designy " rather than " crap " .
But where do I find a palette ?
I can't even coordinate colors when I dress myself in the morning !
Well , a little color theory goes a long way , and if you spend fifteen minutes googling " color theory " or " colour theory " , which is the inferior British version of the theory , you 'll be ahead of the game .
But if you do n't have time for that , here 's a few things that work wonders :
Use a photographic image .
Think about the theme or setting of your game , and find an image that reminds you of it .
If you 're making an abstract game , consider theming it , but you can just find any image you like .
Then , when making your game art , NEVER use the color chooser , instead ONLY sample colors from your palette image with the eyedropper tool .
With a little luck , your game will pick up the " mood " of this image .
Use a palette from a real artist .
There are sites listed below that have great pre-built palettes to start with .
Start with one of these , and use the colors in your game .
With this approach , you 'll often need more than the 5 or so colors you get in the palette .
Resist the urge to free - pick from the color chooser , instead , make new colors by combining ones from your palette .
For example , draw atop the palette with a semi- transparent brush .
For a larger game , you may want to use a different palette per level or world area .
If your interface elements and main character are neutral colors , or if these palettes share a common accent color , you can share them between levels or area .
This example uses a " monochromatic " palette , all the colors are different shades of a very similar hue , other color schemes have more variety but what 's important is that the colors all work together well .
Resources :
Adobe 's Kuler Site
ColourLovers
MultiColr from idee labs
This awesome site is the best of both worlds : make a palette and get a bunch of photos that go with it .
Just pick a few colors you like , then pick an image that looks good , then color - pick from it .
Done !
Tip # 2 : Hide your shame with a clever theme
I can't draw !
Maybe , you 're just too cool to draw .
Maybe it 's intentional .
That 's it .
Instead of making good art , choose a theme that requires bad art .
It worked for " SketchFighter " and " Crayon Physics "
Or use what you 've got available .
Just got some crap on your desk ?
You could have made one of the most popular games of all time , Desktop Tower Defense .
People are starting to catch on to this trick , but it 's got a few years of life left in it .
Be creative ... maybe your characters are all gingerbread cookies , and you can literally bake them up .
Or some kind of zombie bacon attacking your kitchen .
Or even a furry chest in need of a shave .
Tip # 3 : Simple Shapes and Silhouettes
Circle , Square , Triangle , Rhombus , Trapezoid , Parallelogram , etc. .
You know how to compute their area exactly , but do you know how to draw them badly ?
Sketch a couple of shapes freehand , and then add eyes ( for a character ) or wheels ( for a vehicle ) or whatever .
They 'll probably come out wobbly and goofy , not very precise at all .
Depending on how much coffee you 've had already , they might be a completely different shape .
That 's ok !
That 's good , in fact , as the imperfections and variations create " personality " and make them come alive .
Do n't use the " shape tools " in your drawing program , it is the destroyer of sprite 's souls .
By making their forms distinct , you make it easy for the player to differentiate between them visually .
" Smiles " from Sykhronics is a great example of this .
Distinct shape and color help you immediately recognise the shapes .
You could probably still play the game on a two - color iPhone .
Look at the silhouettes of the shapes .
You can use " threshold " or select the outside , invert it , and fill on a new layer , to see this directly .
Can you tell what they are just by their outline ?
Can you tell them apart at least ?
You can distinguish the items ( from my TINS entry " Railroad Merchant " ) here from their outlines , and could even recognise some of them .
For items with a similar shape I still made sure the outline was different .
This is even more important in 3D .
Assign a solid black material and view the model on a white background ( or vice versa ) .
Zoom out until it's as big as you expect it to be on the screen during normal gameplay .
Does it read ?

This is explained way more eloquently in this blog post :
Good Design lies in the foundation
Tip # 4 : Draw more than you need
For the next few tips , we 'll develop a sprite for a hypothetical platformer .
Let 's say we need an enemy , something you can't jump on top of without taking damage .
My first though was some kind of spikey turtle ( real original , huh ? ) .
The first mistake a programmer will make is to think that his or her ugly sprite will get better by just continuing to work on it .
It wo n't !
If it starts out bad , it stays bad .
So instead of pixel - pushing for an hour , just sketch a bunch of and only detail the one you like the best .
I started sketching some random enemies , not putting to much detail or thought into them .
You can do this quickly and just abandon anything that 's not working .
I did n't like my turtle at all ( he looks kind of like a vampire ferret that someone set on fire ) .
I decided I liked the lobster guy the best , because of his interesting shape , clear silhoutte , and I think he 's kind of a unique enemy .
Tip # 5 : Work at higher resolution
For sprite art , I work at 10 x the resolution I need .
So if I am making a 64x64 sprite , I work using at least 640x640 .
Sometimes , a rather ugly character at hi-res becomes a pretty good sprite .
Even for backgrounds and logos and stuff , I try to work at 2 - 3 times the target resolution .
If you are careful about the edges when downsampling ( see next tip ) you can get lots of detail with crisp edges .
For the lobster guy , I took the original sketch and traced over an outline .
I typed " lobster " into Google Images and that gave me the idea to make him blue instead of red , and gave me some ideas for more details .
Then I colored him in on a different layer below the outline , so I did n't have to worry about messing up my outline .
Once he was filled in with solid colors , I set " lock alpha " on and just added some shading .
Do n't lose sight of the fact that you 're going to downres the heck out of him .
You can get caught up in drawing all kinds of fine detail , but it will all get turned to mush in the next step .
It 's always a good idea to zoom out to get an idea of what the finished product will look like ( or just check the Navigator window ) .
He 's still kind of sloppy and not very detailed but next we 're going to downsample him and that will hide all of that .
Well , mostly .
Tip # 6 : Watch your Edges
Photoshop ( and other paint programs ) tries to helpfully blend everything together , giving you nice , smooth antialiased edges .
Which is great , except when you want a crisp edge for your 1 - bit alpha .
Photoshop has ruined many a 3D tree - billboard and beautiful 2D sprite edge with it 's overzealous edge mushing .
Here 's my workflow for making sprites into game - ready images .
I should make this an action or a script , someday , but it 's pretty simple :
Step 1 : Isolate the hi-res version on a transparent background
Step 2 : Downsample to target resolution
Here 's he's ( just about ) 64x64 , still against a transparent background .
Step 3 : Make a crispy edge
Here 's how to get the edges right :
Magic
Wand the transparent parts .
Important :
Set a very low " tolerance " value and most importantly , make sure " anti-alias " is set to OFF .
Invert the selection ( CTRL - SHIFT- I ) .
It should be about a pixel or so bigger than the subject .
Make a new layer underneath the subject , and fill the selection with solid black ( or your outline color ) .
If you 're game engine wants a color - key background like in this example , add it now as a solid layer below .
If you 're using transparency , just leave the transparent background as -is .
Now you should end up with the sprite blended smoothly into a sharp , crisp edge .
Step 4 : Clean up the pixels
Only now do you start messing with individual pixels .
Your outline will probably be a little chunky , use the pencil tool to clean it up , and also add detail to the parts of the sprite that got a little blurred in the downsampling .
Here , I just cleaned up the face , the tail , and the antennae .
The point is the most time - consuming way to paint a sprite is one pixel at a time .
So you want to put off on this step until as late as possible .
Done :
The final enemy sprite
Here 's the final sprite at regular and 2 x size .
It 's not perfect , and it 's certainly not going to get me a job at Square or anything , but it turned out all right for programmer art .
Tip # 7 : Create Variations
You might want twenty monsters or spaceships for your game .
Great !
But you only have so much time .
If you create one or two monster - spaceships that you like , you can make variations of them .
Change the color .
Many of the creatures in " Diablo " were just other creatures with different colors .
Same deal with Pac - Man .
Or you can change the scale , cut and paste parts .
Instead of a meatasaur , vegisaur and a monkisaur , create a whole genus of related meatsaurs with slighty different features .
You can turn out five or ten variations in the time it takes to do one new creature .
With the hue / saturation tool , I made a red version of the and erased his antennae .
Then I added wings to get a completely different enemy .
An added bonus of this technique is that it will make all your enemies look stylisticly similar , so your levels look more consistent , almost as if you planned it that way .
Tip # 8 : Avoid Animation
Use a theme that does n't need it .
Spaceships do n't need much animation .
Vechicles do n't really , and you can fake wheels moving .
If you can come up with a concept that does n't need animation , you 're much better off .
And you 'll save yourself some coding time , too .
If you must , start with simple cheats .
Just flip an overhead sprite of a character horizontally and you 've got a 2 - frame run cycle .
You can get away with amazingly few frames , look at sprite rips from old gameboy and NES games to see just how few .
Final Fantasy Sprites
Use templates .
Do n't steal a sprite rip , but steal the poses from it .
For this sprite , I found an example of a sprite from Mega - Man , and drew a new sprite , but used the same poses .
Rotoscoping : it 's not just for singing orcs anymore .
Many digital cameras have a " burst " mode , or you can film a short video and extract the frames .
Film yourself doing a few simple actions , extract the frame and start tracing .
Recognize this ?
Warning : this can turn into a time sink if you 're not careful , so do n't get carried away filming stuff .
It 's just a guide .
Tip # 9 : Skyboxen
Making a 3D game ?
The wordcomes from the ancient Sumerian , which was a type of slave assigned to do a thankless , repetitive task such as rowing or turning a millstone .
There is little more painful in game art than have to create not just one frame that looks good , but ten or twenty .
So do n't do it !
Implementing a simple skybox is not very hard to do .
But in terms of visual bang - for - the - buck , they can't be beat .
The skybox does the important job of FILLING THE SCREEN WITH SOMETHING .
I say " skybox " here but this could be any type of panoramic background , from a cube - mapped skybox , to a panoramic image on a sphere or hemisphere , to a simple background image for a 2 Dish game .
But where do I get a nice skybox image ?
Wait until sunset or a nice cloud formation wanders by , go outside ( or get up to your roof ) and take some photos .
Obviously , this is weather dependent , you do n't get brilliant sunsets everyday ( unless you live in Florida ) , but you can post - process the heck out of whatever you shoot .
Just to illustrate , the day after I wrote this , I took these pictures on the way home from the supermarket .
This was a little unusual , where I live is not known for gorgeous sunsets like this , but even on a normal day you 'll get something .
ps .
They 're a bit blurry , but I 've included links to the full - res versions , so if you want to use them for something go ahead , use without any restrictions .
Paint it yourself !
Here 's a quick tutorial I whipped up on painting skies :
Compare how much better Zillagame ( my first ludumdare entry ever ! ) looks .
On the left , no skybox ( and an alpha sorting bug ) , and on the right with the skybox we just made .
If this is n't for a contest , there are tons of free or reasonably priced skybox images online .
1000 skies
Just google for " Free HDR Skies " .
You do n't need HDR for game purposes but that makes it easier to find .
Or search for " Sky Pano " or " sunset " on flickr ( but check the license before you use any of these ) .
Also , keep in mind that the sky is the major light source for the outside world .
This goes hand in hand with the " color palette " tip above .
Use colors from the skybox when making your level and setting up your lighting .
Of course , your game does n't have to take place at sunset .
Unless it 's a racing game , I think there 's some sort of law requiring that .
A clear midday sky , a photoshopped alien landscape , whatever is most appropriate for the setting of your level .
Tip # 10 : Bake in lighting
This works for a level or a character .
It might not be " correct " , especially when you mix it with runtime lighting , but it looks good .
If you texture your level / character without overlapping anywhere , you can do this without writing an extra line of code by baking light and combining it directly into your color texture map , and if you take a bit of time to handle multiple UV sets you can get full - on lightmapping in your game .
In my 48 hour game , " Bugzapper " , all the lighting on the structure is baked into the texture .
In fact , I ran out of time to even paint the diffuse texture .
The light direction is totally wrong with respect to the skybox , but most people wo n't notice that , anyways .
Here 's instructions on how to use Blender to bake .
Maya and others have similar fuctions .
Do n't worry about baking all the fancy amboccl / normal map stuff , if you 're not writing a real game .
Just bake EVERYTHING in ( " aka full render bake " ) to the base texture and then use no lighting or very simple lighting in your game .
Baking Lighting with Blender
Here 's another example of using this on a terrain in blender to make it look good :
Blender terrain baking
One word of warning , do n't try to figure this out during a contest .
Try it out beforehand to get the process down first , you can waste a lot of time figuring out how to do this , but once you have it , it can take 15 - 20 minutes during a contest and make a huge difference .
Also , wait until you are sure you are final with your model 's textures before doing this .
You can't unbake , and you do n't want to have to do this twice .
Tip # 11 : Get a Tablet
Even if you have no aspirations to be a game artist , if you are doing any drawing on your computer at all , then you owe it to yourself to get a tablet .
You do n't need a big one or a fancy one , a 4x6 is fine .
You can find used serial tablets on ebay super - cheap , and Wacom 's new " Bamboo " looks very affordable .
Drawing with a mouse is like drawing with a brick .
When a lot of people I know first buy a tablet , they take a while to get used to it .
Here 's some tips to help make the most of a tablet
In the control panel , crank up the pressure sensitivity towards firm .
You want to have to really mash down on it to get full pressure .
By default , the pressure is way too loose and you end up losing most of the control
Drawing with a sheet of blank paper totally changes the feel .
Different types of paper -- copy paper , magazine pages , construction paper , etc -- can totally change the feel .
Experiment .
Practice .
I know I said none of these tips require practice , but I lied .
Try these exercises :
In Photoshop , make 10 squares in a row and fill them with greyscale from 0 % ( black ) to 100 % ( white ) .
Beneath them , make 10 empty squares .
Try to shade the squares below to match the guide squares ( if you squint your eyes at them ) .
Try this with different brushes , practice the pressure sensetivity .
Try handwriting something , like the alphabet or copy a passage of text .
Start out very large , with huge letters , and get progressively smaller .
This will both get your hand used to the tablet , and your eyes used to looking at the screen while you are drawing somewhere else .
Also , in this day of touch - screen interfaces , having a tablet can be a cheap way to prototype touch - style gameplay ( though without the multitouch ) .
It 's not exactly the same but it 's a lot closer than using a mouse .

Stand - up
Boyle is best - known for his stint on Mock The Week The BBC Trust 's editorial standards committee ( ESC ) has apologised over a joke made by Frankie Boyle on Radio 4 comedy show Political Animal in 2008 .
One person complained when the Scottish comedian compared the state of Palestine to a cake " being punched to pieces by a very angry Jew " .
The BBC 's complaints unit responded in December 2008 , and agreed the comment was " inappropriate and offensive " .
But the complainant was dissatisfied and took the issue to the BBC Trust .
He expressed concern that the remark had gone through the editorial process " without ringing any alarm bells " .
The complaint was considered by the ESC , which is the ultimate arbiter in the BBC complaints process .
It has now responded , saying it endorsed the earlier finding about the use of the word " Jew " .
It added : " As a result , the committee wished to apologise to the complainant on behalf of the BBC for any offence the remark may have caused him and other listeners to the programme . "
' Very sorry '
The committee noted that the BBC had informed the radio show 's production company that the material was unacceptable and breached guidelines .
Radio 4's commissioning editor also discussed the matter with Boyle 's agent , who confirmed she had in turn raised the issue with her client .
The committee was satisfied " that the breach , while serious , did not require an apology or correction from the BBC online or on air .
" In conclusion , the committee stated that it was very sorry that the breach of editorial standards had occurred in this case , but was satisfied that no further action was required . "
Boyle , 37 , found himself in hot water again recently when the mother of a five - year - old girl with Down 's syndrome criticised him for poking fun at people with the condition during a live show .
And last year , Mock The Week 's producers were criticised by the BBC Trust over comments Boyle made on the show about swimmer Rebecca Adlington 's appearance .
Another complaint against Mock The Week , relating to a comment Boyle made about the Queen , was not upheld as a breach of editorial standards by the trust .

“ When , ” a senior Liberal was complaining the other day , “ are we going to start doing stuff that people like , instead of just pissing them off all the time ? ”
It was a rhetorical question , but Premier Dalton McGuinty provided an answer on Thursday : Um , immediately .
Following just 54 hours of protest from a few conservative religious leaders and parents , McGuinty abandoned Ontario ’s new sex education curriculum .
The proposed guidelines , two years in the making , would have modernized a teaching plan that dates back to 1997 – a prehistoric era before Google , YouTube , Twitter or Facebook .
As of September , Grade 1 students were to be taught body parts , including the correct terms for genitalia , which experts say can help prevent sexual abuse .
More controversially , Grade 3 students would have learned about homosexuality and , in Grade 6 , masturbation .
Concepts of anal and oral sex were part of the Grade 7 lesson plan .
That led social conservatives like Charles McVety , president of the Canada Christian College , to charge the new curriculum was pandering to “ a special - interest group ” of homosexuals .
Various Roman Catholic organizations also expressed concern their publicly funded schools would have to teach subject matter forbidden by the Church , leading to threats of a constitutional challenge .
Behind the scenes , some leaders in the south Asian community , an influential constituency in the Ontario Liberal Party , warned the courses offended traditional values .
While the education ministry bungled by furtively unveiling the new curriculum on its website in January without even a press release , suggestions that McGuinty was kept out of the loop have insiders puzzled .
He runs one of the most centralized administrations in Ontario history and is the self - styled “ education premier . ”
The physical health and education curriculum revamp began in 2007 and involved a full year of research and consultation with public and Catholic school boards , university faculties of education , and health and parent groups .
After an initial draft , it was then was sent back for public feedback and the education ministry received 3,000 responses before it was fact - checked and finalized in late 2009 .
So any claim by opponents that rogue mandarins — or former education minister Kathleen Wynne , Ontario ’s first openly lesbian cabinet member — quietly pushed a personal agenda are implausible .
This was official government policy and , as the premier himself said on Tuesday , two days before his flip - flop , “ why would n’t we recognize we live in an information age and why would n’t we try to present this info in a thoughtful , responsible , and open way ? ”
But when McGuinty realized he had enabled social conservatives to frame the sex education debate and was losing ground in the court of public opinion — or at least on talk radio and in the right - wing press — he retreated .
“ We can only fight one war at a time , ” a Liberal strategist confided Friday .
“ Right now it ’s the pharmacists and that should be over by the time the HST hits , ” the insider said , referring to the current battle over prescription drug prices and the July 1 implementation of the 13 per cent harmonized sales tax that blends the provincial sales tax with the federal GST .
There are also internal skirmishes for the premier – on Thursday , 15 Liberal MPPs joined Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats to pass second reading of legislation by maverick Grit Kevin Flynn to stop a gas - fired power plant in his Oakville riding .

Flynn ’s private member ’s bill is unlikely to pass third reading —
McGuinty has railed against NIMBY - ism and emphasized the need for new generation in Oakville — but the 28 - 1 vote shows Liberal MPPs are n’t afraid to assert their independence .
With caucus dissent over the electricity plant and lingering fears about the political cost of the HST , the last thing McGuinty needed was socially conservative Ontarians hounding Liberal MPPs .
Seventeen months before the next election , the premier wants to start putting out fires , not stoking them .

On the heels of the milestone accomplishment of airing the 200th episode of " South Park , " creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker have announced that they will be hitting Broadway in March of 2011 with the production " The Book of Mormon . "
It 's a project the duo first announced back in 2008 , after the passage of the gay - marriage - banning Proposition 8 in California ( for which the Mormon Church campaigned heavily ) .
According to a press release , the Colorado duo wrote the book , music , and lyrics with Tony award - winner Robert Lopez , one of the creators of the hit musical " Avenue Q. "
While no cast announcements have been made , Parker will direct alongside Jason Moore ( another " Avenue Q " alumnus ) with Scott Rudin and Anne Garefino listed to produce .
" Growing up in Colorado , a lot of our friends were Mormons and we always thought their book would make a great musical , " Parker and Stone said in a statement .
" We loved ' Avenue Q ' and are having a blast working with Bobby Lopez .
Having a show on Broadway is a dream come true for us and we can't wait to share ' The Book of Mormon ' with everyone . "
" The Book of Mormon " tells the story of Joseph Smith , who founded the Latter Day Saints movement in the early 1800s , while also following two modern - day Mormon missionaries sent to Uganda , according to BBC News .
The idea for the production has apparently been percolating for a while .
Back in 2003 , the controversial , musical " All About the Mormons " episode of " South Park " satirized the founding of the religion .
While this is the first major stage production for Stone and Parker , the two are no strangers to musicals .
Aside from writing the music and lyrics for the occasional " South Park " song , Parker directed , wrote and starred in the 1996 cult - classic " Cannibal !
The Musical " alongside Stone .
The pair even garnered a songwriting Oscar nomination for " Blame Canada , " from their 1999 film " South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut . "
Parker 's music writing credits also include collaborating on many of the tracks for their 2004 marionette action movie , " Team America : World Police . "
THE Crows have been smashed by 43 points in a feeble capitulation to Sydney at AAMI Stadium today .
The result buries the Swans ' six - year hoodoo against the Crows , while Adelaide 's second defeat in a row raises serious questions about their top eight credentials .
The Swans blew the game open with a seven - goal second quarter and led by as much as 50 points before cruising home to an 18.10 ( 118 ) to 11.9 ( 75 ) result that consigned Adelaide to consecutive defeats and a myriad of questions about their true capabilities .
Able to find far more space and time than they had dreamed of in six years of losses to the Crows , Sydney played a commanding brand of football against opponents sorely lacking in system , confidence and skill .
They were driven by outstanding games from former Hawk Ben McGlynn ( five goals ) and Ryan O'Keefe ( three ) who took turns to cut the Crows to pieces across half - forward .
Four of McGlynn 's goals arrived as the last link in the attacking chain that burst through the Adelaide zone , making it look like he was playing as a loose man in attack .
Another recruit , former West Coast ruckman Mark Seaby , was consistently able to get his hands to the ball at the stoppages , allowing Sydney to win both the clearance and contested possession counts .
A five - goal game by Patrick Dangerfield provided the sole ray of light for the Crows .
The loss of Scott Stevens and Nathan van Berlo had robbed Adelaide of two of their harder running and more versatile players , while none of Brett Burton , Jason Porplyzia , Ivan Maric or James Sellar could be expected to dominate in their first games after pre-seasons interrupted by injury .
Sydney 's greater fluency gave them a two - goal lead at the first change , as the Swans showed an ability to burst through the zones that had given them lost of trouble in recent years .
Problems in Adelaide 's structure that were hinted at in the first quarter bloomed into a full - scale emergency in the second , as Sydney clambered all over the fragile home side .
Seaby in the ruck , O'Keefe in midfield and McGlynn up forward were all proving far too clever and tough for their opponents , while skipper Brett Kirk kept Bernie Vince quiet and epitomised the kind of pressure that drew repeated Crow errors .
The Swans had not topped 100 points against Adelaide 's usually miserly defence since 2001 , but at halftime they were well on course to break through for both a high score and a comfortable win with 11.4 and a gaping advantage .
Any fleeting hopes the crowd may have had of watching a stirring Adelaide riposte were wiped out in the third , as McGlynn again found himself in a ludicrous amounts of space in attack .
Though Adelaide kicked a couple of goals late in the quarter to creep within 38 points , Sydney were never in any danger of surrendering a lead they had held almost from the start .

Once , not so long ago , a famous golfer was unfaithful to the public image that sportswriters had helped construct for him , and the sportswriters were sad .
But then along came Phil Mickelson , and the sportswriters turned him into a Lifetime movie .

Rick Reilly® , for instance , last seen having his precious illusions shattered because Tiger Woods turned out to be something less than a combination of Bobby Jones and St. Francis of Assisi , devotes his Masters column to whipping up all sorts of new illusions , this time about Phil Mickelson :
Actually , Phil Mickelson won , but for millions of women around the country , it must feel like a lipstick - sized victory .
Mickelson , in case you forgot , is the guy who stayed true to his wife .
He 's the guy who 's been missing tournaments the last 11 months while he flies her back and forth to a breast cancer specialist in Houston .
He 's the guy who did n't need reminding that women are not disposable .
Mani - pedis for everybody !
Are we sure that Mickelson stayed true ?
Are we any more certain of this than we once were of Tiger Woods 's halo ?
Have n't the past six months been an object lesson in the total folly of divining someone 's true nature from a couple magazine spreads and a shaving commercial ?

Reilly goes on to yammer about Amy Mickelson and " walking rainbows " and some other assorted psychedelia ( he also makes a great deal of Mickelson 's heroic unpreparedness — how he had played " only " seven tournaments this year entering the Masters , which , incidentally , is one more than Anthony Kim had played ) .
And then Reilly closes with a line that I 'm fairly certain was swiped from a Judith Krantz novel :
But for this one Sunday in a flower - stuffed pocket of Georgia , the good husband , the good son , the good man actually got rewarded .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
For the sake of comparison , here 's Mike Lupica :
And sometimes the story is still one of the best and oldest in sports :
Good guy wins .
And here 's the inevitable Jay Mariotti , who , shortly after declaring that the Tiger Woods scandal had " demoralized the American spirit " ( I 'm not kidding ) , writes :
Finally , we have some justice in the world .
The right man won .
And it was morning again in America .
Mani - pedis for everybody !
OK , so Jay Mariotti is very clearly a crazy person who differs from a guy in a sandwich board yelling on top of an overturned milk crate only in that one of them writes his prose in crayon and the other is a guy in a sandwich board yelling on top of an overturned milk crate .
But on this , at least , he 's not unlike a lot of his sportswriting brethren who are busily fashioning heroes out of cardboard .
We 'd all love for Mickelson to be the good man , the right man .
We 'd all love for him to be both Bobby Jones and St. Francis of Assisi .
But I 'm not sure Reilly or Lupica or Mariotti or Thomas Boswell possesses any more special insight into Mickelson and the quality of his domestic life than any of them did into Tiger Woods and the contents of his Blackberry , and I 'm not sure they 're doing anything here except swapping one unicorn for another and setting themselves up to look like suckers all over again .

Exclusive : The Secret Shelters That Protect Afghan Women Bibi tells ABC News ' Diane Sawyer why husband cut off her nose and ears .
KABUL , Afghanistan March 11 , 2010  --
Not every Afghan is hoping the Americans soon leave their country .
Some are actually dreading it .
" You ca n't leave Afghanistan , " Manizha , who helps run a shelter for battered women , recently warned " World News " anchor Diane Sawyer .
Behind Manizha , women who were beaten , bruised and badly scarred shake their heads in urgent agreement .
The secret women 's shelter is run by Manizha -- who , like most Afghans , goes by only one name -- and by New Yorker Esther Hyneman .
It is one of a string of shelters and counseling centers that opened in 2007 and have since helped about 1,500 Afghan women escape beatings and abuse that can shock even battle - hardened combat surgeons .
Among the most heartbreaking is the story of Bibi .
She is 17 , and she says her face was mutilated by her husband , a Talib .
Bibi's nose and ears were cut off as punishment for running away to escape the constant pummeling by her husband and his family .
She was married to the radical Muslim when she was 12 , Manizha told Sawyer .
Her marriage was the result of an outlawed tribal custom called " baad " in which the daughter was given away as compensation for a crime or offense committed by a male member of Bibi 's family .
Girls given away in baad transactions are often little more than slaves .
Bibi was forced to sleep in a stable with the animals , and beatings and pain became part of life for her .

Bibi tried to escape but was captured .
Her husband was ordered by the Taliban to punish her by disfiguring her face .
While her brother - in - law held her down , her husband sliced off her nose and ears .
Left for dead , she crawled to her uncle 's house , but he refused to help .
Bibi staggered on to her grandfather 's house .
He called her father .
The local Afghan hospital was unable to treat her wounds , and suggested her father take her to the nearby U.S. military base , Forward Operating Base Ripley in Oruzgan province .
" She was very scared .
She covered up , " said Air Force Sgt. Lindsay Clark , a medic who was on duty when Bibi arrived three days after the attack .
Maj .
Jeff Lewis , an Air Force surgeon , told ABC News he was used to seeing war wounds , but Bibi 's injuries appalled him .
" It was barbaric and shocking to see this , that somebody had done this to this young girl ...
It was unlike anything I 've ever seen , " Lewis said .
" I 'm surprised that ... it still exists , this type of problem in the world . "
Despite their scars -- from fists , knives , burns , electrical cords -- there is an argument that the women at Manizha 's shelter are the lucky ones .
These women have found a way out of their brutal marriages .
Millions of Afghan women are routinely handed over for marriages while they are still children and endure lives of constant battering .
" Ninety percent of Afghan women have experienced some form of human rights violation , 15 million Afghan women probably need our help , " Manizha told Sawyer .
It 's not just Afghan women who want things to change .
" Husbands , fathers and brothers , they come for help , " Hyneman told Sawyer .
" They want a peaceful life ... a family life and want to be able to support their children , " rather than marry them off at a young age .
Despite Her Scars , Bibi Likes to Sing
" Men want their daughters educated .
They beg us all the time .
Build schools for our daughters , we want our daughters to go to school .
They 've learned the price of ignorance and illiteracy , " Hyneman said .
That price is starkly visible on Bibi 's face and in her behavior .
She keeps a hand in front of her , and looks away when she speaks .
When first treated at the U.S. base , Bibi was so modest and shy that she did n't want to show her facial wounds to the male doctor .
" At one point she began screaming , not very pleased with the male presence , " Lewis said .
The doctor had to rely on Clark and other female aides to clean her wounds and assess the damage .
Bibi recuperated at the U.S. base for 2 1/ 2 months , slowly letting out details of her ordeal , slowly regaining trust and emerging from her shell .
Doctors in the U.S. have offered their services to help reconstruct her face .
But Bibi can't yet fathom what her future holds .
When Sawyer asked her what she dreams will happen , Bibi said , " I do n't know what will happen in the future . "
When Sawyer asks about the offer from American doctors to help her , Bibi tilts her hands up in a gesture of " who knows ? "
She touches her nose and covers up her face with a scarf .
Her new American friends say that Bibi 's courage is inspiring .
" The thing about Bibi , even after everything that had happened to her , she was in such good spirits , " said Clark , who said she became " very close " to Bibi .
The medic said Bibi sang a lot .
" She would sing about what she saw outside and the people around her and I guess however she was feeling that day is what she would sing about . "
But there are many other women like Bibi who have no hope of rescue and the hope of change seems out of reach without help from the outside world .
Education is the answer , Manizha says .
" Lots of education and lots of patience with the international community , " she says .
" You ca n't leave Afghanistan . "

The base serves as a transit point for operations in Afghanistan Kyrgyzstan 's interim government says it will extend the US lease on a key air base , a day after the ousted president , Kurmanbek Bakiyev , left the country .
The deputy leader , Omurbek Tekebayev , said the agreement over Manas air force base - a logistics hub for Afghanistan - would extend for another year .
The US had feared that the change of government in the Central Asian nation could affect the base deal .
On Thursday , the ousted leader flew to Kazakhstan , easing fears of violence .
He was overthrown in mass protests on 7 April .
More than 80 people were killed when anti-government protests in the capital , Bishkek , and other towns turned violent .
' Brink of war ' " Kyrgyzstan is extending by one year the validity of the agreement with the United States over the Manas transit centre , " Mr Tekebayev said .
He said that parliament should make its own decision on the base but that because there was currently no parliament in place the lease , which runs out in July , would automatically be renewed .
The announcement came only hours after Mr Bakiyev agreed to leave , formally resigning from neighbouring Kazakhstan .
He had initially refused to stand down , instead retreating to his home in the south of the country and attempting to rally supporters .
Ms Otunbayeva promised justice over the 7 April violence Addressing the nation , interim leader Roza Otunbayeva said he had been allowed to leave to avoid bloodshed .
She said his speeches in the south " in the company of militants armed to the teeth brought the country to the brink of a civil war " .
" Under these circumstances , with the active mediation of peace missions from the OSCE and the UN and the personal participation of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev , US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , the interim government was presented with the need to take urgent decisive measures , " she said .
She promised that Mr Bakiyev would be held accountable for the deaths of 7 April .
" Bakiyev will not avoid justice .
He will not be able to hide in any country of the world , " she said .
Correspondents say there is considerable anger against Mr Bakiyev in Bishkek over the violence .
Since his departure , the interim government has been consolidating its power .
A warrant has been issued for one of Mr Bakiyev 's brothers , Zhanybek , the former head of the presidential guard service who is accused of ordering troops to open fire on protesters on 7 April in Bishkek .
Other relatives of Mr Bakiyev handed weapons to officials in the family stronghold in the south of the country .
The former defence minister , Baktybek Kaliyev , has already been arrested .

New legal trick :
Fake hospital sites for finding clients
( Fortune ) -- Until about noon on Wednesday , dozens of websites were identifying themselves with a Red Cross-ish logo and names like " VA Medical Center Palo Alto , " or " VA Hospital San Francisco , " or " VA Medical Center Gainesville " though they had no affiliation with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs .
They were actually operated by plaintiffs law firms that were searching for clients with asbestos - related diseases .
The sites were designed in ways that might easily confuse elderly and infirm veterans into falsely believing that the VA itself was recommending that they see certain lawyers if they suffered from asbestos - related illnesses .
( Unfortunately , this article is not an April Fool 's joke . )
Many veterans were exposed to asbestos during their service in World War II , Korea , and Vietnam .
Because those dying from an asbestos - related cancer called mesothelioma ( nearly 100 % fatal ) may be entitled to large awards from former asbestos manufacturers or their bankruptcy trusts , contingent - fee lawyers -- who are paid a percentage of their clients ' recoveries -- have strong financial incentives to find and sign up such clients .
I started making inquiries of the three firms listed as " sponsoring " these sites -- including a prominent New York - based pharmaceutical and medical device plaintiffs firm known as Seeger Weiss -- on mid-afternoon Tuesday .
None of the firms initially got back to me but by Wednesday morning the sites had received a modest facelift , adding a tiny disclaimer at the top of each home page stating " Not Affiliated with the Department of Veterans Affairs . "
At the bottom , a second disclaimer had also been added in small , faint - gray print .
It stated that the site was " sponsored by " Seeger Weiss and two other law firms , identified only as the Flood Law Office and Melinda J. Helbock , APC .
( Prior to my calls , the information was provided only if the reader clicked on a similarly faint - gray link labeled " disclaimer . " )
Each site purported to be copyrighted by the " VA Medical Center " in question .
Late Wednesday morning , Christopher Seeger , the founding partner of Seeger Weiss reached me , apologized for not having seen my earlier emails , and said he'd had " no idea -- none , " that the sites were listing Seeger Weiss as a sponsor .
He blamed the problem on his firm 's newly opened Los Angeles office .
" I do n't know these guys Flood and Helbock , " Seeger continued .
" I 've instructed them to pull our name off and take them down , " Weiss said .
" I was contacted by them and told they do n't have the resources and asked if we were interested in accepting referrals ...
I do n't want my name on a Website that purports to be a government site .
I have n't accepted a case from them yet . "
By early Wednesday afternoon the sites had been pulled down and , as of this writing , attempts to reach the sites bring up a page reading : " Under construction ! "
Repeated calls to the Flood and Helbock offices on Tuesday and Wednesday were not returned .
The sites were located at addresses like , for instance , www.vamedicalcenterpaloalto.com or www.vamedicalhospitalsanfrancisco.com.
We are not hyperlinking to the addresses because , should the sites be restored in any form , linking to them might raise their standing in search results provided by major search engines .
As of Tuesday , my searches for " VA Medical Center Palo Alto " always generated a listing in which the law firm 's site was on the first page of results , and on one occasion it was the third link offered .
There appeared to be one of these law firm - sponsored " VA Medical Center " sites for virtually every veterans hospital in the nation .
Google caches of some pages still appear to be available , capturing at least portions of their content .
When I first noticed the sites about two weeks ago , they were then " sponsored by " a different firm , a small office in Alton , Ill. , called Saville , Evola & Flint .
A call to that firm Tuesday was also not returned .
Each VA Medical Center site began with a paragraph describing the VA institution in question , and it sometimes provided the institution 's correct address and phone number .
However , the sites also listed -- three and , sometimes , four times -- a telephone number referred to as " our hotline . "
The sites also invited readers exposed to asbestos and seeking legal assistance to fill out an online form .
My call to the number Tuesday afternoon was answered by a male voice saying , " hotline . "
I inquired if this was the VA Medical Center Palo Alto and was told , " This is not the actual medical center , no , but we do advertise on their website . "
I identified myself as a reporter and , when asked , he identified himself as a legal assistant at Seeger Weiss .
He took my number and said he would have the appropriate person get back to me for comment on whether the site was misleading .
No one did until I renewed calls to the Seeger Weiss firm Wednesday morning .
There is nothing new , of course , about so - called spam sites -- parked domains set up to capture misspellers or the unwary Web surfer .
It has also been previously reported that some plaintiffs law firms operate sites that at least superficially resemble disinterested nonprofits acting on behalf of mesothelioma victims , some of which employ the " .org " suffix commonly associated with nonprofits .
This was , however , the first time I 'd seen sites labeling themselves in ways that seemed to invite confusion with veterans hospitals .
Aside from the distastefulness of deceiving aging men and women who have served their country , and the stain it places on the legal profession itself , who else might be hurt by sites like these ?
It is probably competitor asbestos plaintiffs lawyers , those disdaining to stoop to such methods , that are hurt most directly .
" It 's cheating , " says one such competitor , who brought the sites to my attention , but requested anonymity .
Stephen Gillers , a legal ethics professor at New York University School of Law , reviewed the VA Medical Center Palo Alto site Wednesday morning at my request ( after the home page disclaimers had been added ) .
In an email he wrote : " I had to look closely to find evidence that a law firm sponsored the site .
The law firm connection is submerged .
The first impression , and maybe the last one before a user replies to a questionnaire , is that the site offers assistance on health , not law .
I consider the home page misleading and misleading advertisements are forbidden . "
A second legal ethics authority , professor William H. Simon of Columbia Law School had a similar reaction : " It seems highly misleading , " he wrote in an email .
" Both the substance and the look - and - feel convey the impression that the VA is offering the services ...
The site I looked at -- the Palo Alto one -- is so deceptive that prosecution would be a slam dunk for any regulator that went after this . "
Japanese gut bacteria have picked up genes that help their hosts digest the seaweed used to wrap sushi
The next time you order sushi in a Japanese restaurant , raise a glass of sake to the countless marine microbes that might be clinging to it .
Bugs that live on the seaweed used to wrap sushi have given some of their genes to bacteria that live in the human gut , and in doing so , help them to digest the food .
Scientists stumbled on the discovery after sequencing the genetic make - up of marine bacteria that live on Porphyra seaweed and searching DNA databases for matches .
Eleven genes used by the bugs to break down carbohydrates in seaweed also showed up in bacteria isolated from the intestines of Japanese people , but were absent from the gut microbes of North Americans .
Writing in the journal Nature , the scientists describe how a long tradition of seaweed eating in Japan that dates back at least to the 8th century had caused their gut bacteria to adapt to the national diet .
Marine microbes probably swap their genes with bacteria in the gut , giving some the ability to digest seaweed .
The human intestine is home to trillions of bacteria , of which there are an estimated 500 different species .
Many benefit their hosts by helping to break down food that would otherwise be impossible to digest .
" This gives us a hint at how the diversity of bacteria we have in our guts arises and evolves , " said Mirjam Czjzek at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris .
" What we eat and how we prepare it can have an influence on our microflora . "
Czjzek 's team analysed the genes of the marine bacterium Zobellia galactanivorans , which lives on Porphyra algae , and found several that help the microbes digest seaweed .
Further searches found the same genes had been incoporated into a common gut microbe called Bacteroides plebeius .
The scientists have yet to work out whether Japanese people benefit from bacteria in their gut that carry the genes , or if the only advantage is for the bacteria themselves .
In an accompanying article , Justin Sonnenburg at Stanford University School of Medicine writes : " The next time you take a bite of an unfamilar food , think about the microbial inhabitants you may also be ingesting , and the possibility that you will be providing one of your 10 trillion closest friends with a new set of utensils . "
Equality Maryland has been working hard ever since their Attorney General issued an opinion that basically said same sex couples that married out of state will have relationship recognition when they return home .
For many residents who may choose to take the short drive to Washington DC where couples began to marry this week , the opinion was welcome .
There are still lingering questions for these couples so Equality Maryland and Partners put together a FAQ ( .pdf ) to help answer questions for same sex married couples traveling to or living in Maryland .
But even with this important opinion , protections for same sex couples remain vulnerable .
You can help stop a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage in Maryland , or even the possible impeachment of the Attorney General ( and here ) , by sending a strong message that we expect Maryland to start issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples as soon as possible .
This is how you can help .
Recently by Declan McCullagh : Census Time Heightens PrivacyConcerns
Amazon.com filed a lawsuit on Monday to fend off a sweeping demand from North Carolina ’s tax collectors : detailed records including names and addresses of customers and information about exactly what they purchased .
The lawsuit says the demand violates the privacy and First Amendment rights of Amazon ’s customers .
North Carolina ’s Department of Revenue had ordered the online retailer to provide full details on nearly 50 million purchases made by state residents between 2003 and 2010 .
Amazon is asking a federal judge in Seattle to rule that the demand is illegal , and left open the possibility of requesting a preliminary injunction against North Carolina ’s tax collectors .
" The best - case scenario for customers would be where the North Carolina Department of Revenue withdraws their demand because they recognize that it violates the privacy rights of North Carolina residents , " Amazon spokesperson Mary Osako told CNET .
Because Amazon has no offices or warehouses in North Carolina , it ’s not required to collect the customary 5.75 percent sales tax on shipments , although tax collectors have reminded residents that what ’s known as a use tax applies on anything " purchased or received " through the mail .
The dispute arose out of what had otherwise been a routine sales and use tax audit of Amazon by North Carolina ’s tax agency .
A spokeswoman for the North Carolina Department of Revenue said she would have to review the lawsuit before answering why the tax agency needed Amazon customer information .
" Any comment at this time would be premature , " Beth Stevenson said in an e-mail message .
Amazon did provide the state tax collectors with anonymized information about which items were shipped to which zip codes .
But North Carolina threatened to sue if the retailer did not also divulge the names and addresses linked to each order  in other words , personally identifiable information that could be used to collect additional use taxes that might be owed by state residents .
" Despite assurances from tax collectors that the era of Big Brother is n’t here , they seem to be doing a lot to rewrite the book for modern times , " Pete Sepp , the executive vice president for the National Taxpayers Union , told CNET .
" Unless Amazon succeeds , extraordinary demands like these could become the norm . "
The 14 - page complaint says that North Carolina tax collectors visited Amazon in Seattle last month in an effort to " obtain information from Amazon regarding Amazon ’s sales to North Carolina residents . "
They hand - delivered a letter that amounted to an ultimatum : provide customer names by April 19 or face the consequences .

The Best of Declan McCullagh
The man wearing a Rolex watch approached me during a break in my son's basketball game .
" How 's it going ? " he asked .
" Fine . "
" This must be a crazy year for you , " he said .
" Yeah - - but speaking on behalf of children and teachers is a privilege . " I replied .
The man nodded and glanced at a Blackberry in his right hand .
" It must be nice to be a teacher , " he remarked .
" Why 's that ? " I asked .
" Because you do n't have to worry about losing your job , " he answered quickly .
" I wish that I was a teacher in today 's economy . "
Breathe deeply .
Relax .
I wear the scarlet T and must expect a hostile public reaction .
After all , the local and national newspapers are filled with stories about my sins .
I am a member of a " greedy and selfish " union not willing to agree to a wage freeze .
I associate with other subversives not willing to " sacrifice for the benefit of the taxpayers . "
This week 's Sunday editorial page was filled with nasty comments from readers upset with teachers and other municipal employees .
The sustained effort to demonize teachers was effectively reaching the masses .
But I refuse to wash the T from my forehead .
I look at the man with the Rolex watch .
I have known him for many years and this is not the first time he remarked about the benefits of being a teacher .
" Let me ask you something , " I said .
" Why did n't you become a teacher instead of a money manager ? "
" What do you mean ? " he asked .
" I 'm just wondering why you did not decide to become a teacher back in the 1980s , " I said .
" Because I earned a degree in accounting , " he replied .
" No , " I responded .
" You decided not to be a teacher because you wanted to make a lot of money working on Wall Street .
" That 's not --"
" Let me finish , " I said .
" You own a McMansion , a heated in ground swimming pool , and have vacationed in places I can't find on a map . "
" But - - "
" And you once questioned how teachers could live on a yearly salary that was less than the price of your Land Rover . "
" But - - "
" And now teachers and other working - class people are the villains responsible for the economic mess you created . "
" I created ? " he asked incredulously .
" Yes .
Wall Street greed collapsed the economy -- not teachers .
I do n't begrudge anyone from making money , " I continued , " but do n't go out drinking all night and then ask me to suffer the hangover . "
I proudly wear the Scarlet T . What an honest world it would be if others wore the scarlet G .

In Ron Paul 's statement responding to The New Republic 's story about his old newsletters , he said the following :
The quotations in The New Republic article are not mine and do not represent what I believe or have ever believed .
I have never uttered such words and denounce such small - minded thoughts . [… ]
This story is old news and has been rehashed for over a decade . [… ]
When I was out of Congress and practicing medicine full - time , a newsletter was published under my name that I did not edit .
Several writers contributed to the product .
For over a decade , I have publically taken moral responsibility for not paying closer attention to what went out under my name .
Has Paul really disassociated himself from , and " taken moral responsibility " for , these " Ron Paul " newsletters " for over a decade " ?
If he has , that history has not been recorded by the Nexis database , as best as I can reckon .
The first indication I could find of Paul either expressing remorse about the statements or claiming that he did not author them came in an October 2001 Texas Monthly article – less than eight years ago .
Here is the relevant excerpt , which references a Ron Paul newsletter that referred to then - Rep. Barbara Jordan as " Barbara Morondon , " and called her the " archetypical half - educated victimologist " whose " race and sex protect her from criticism " :
What made the statements in the publication even more puzzling was that , in four terms as a U.S. congressman and one presidential race , Paul had never uttered anything remotely like this .
When I ask him why , he pauses for a moment , then says , " I could never say this in the campaign , but those words were n't really written by me .
It was n't my language at all .
Other people help me with my newsletter as I travel around .
I think the one on Barbara Jordan was the saddest thing , because Barbara and I served together and actually she was a delightful lady . "
Paul says that item ended up there because " we wanted to do something on affirmative action , and it ended up in the newsletter and became personalized .
I never personalize anything . "
His reasons for keeping this a secret are harder to understand : " They were never my words , but I had some moral responsibility for them … I actually really wanted to try to explain that it does n't come from me directly , but they [ campaign aides ] said that 's too confusing .
' It appeared in your letter and your name was on that letter and therefore you have to live with it . ' "
It is a measure of his stubbornness , determination , and ultimately his contrarian nature that , until this surprising volte - face in our interview , he had never shared this secret .
It seems , in retrospect , that it would have been far , far easier to have told the truth at the time .
So what exactly did Paul and his campaign say about these and more egregious statements during his contentious 1996 campaign for Congress , when Democrat Lefty Morris made the newsletters a constant issue ?
Besides complaining that the quotes were taken " out of context " and proof of his opponent 's " race - baiting , " Paul and his campaign defended and took full ownership of the comments .
For a chronological Nexis tour of Paul 's 1996 responses , please read on .
The first time I can find reporting on the controversy is in the May 22 , 1996 Dallas Morning News :
Dr. Ron Paul , a Republican congressional candidate from Texas , wrote in his political newsletter in 1992 that 95 percent of the black men in Washington , D.C. , are " semi-criminal or entirely criminal . "
He also wrote that black teenagers can be " unbelievably fleet of foot . " [ … ]
Dr. Paul , who is running in Texas ' 14th Congressional District , defended his writings in an interview Tuesday .
He said they were being taken out of context .
" It 's typical political demagoguery , " he said .
" If people are interested in my character … come and talk to my neighbors . " [ … ]
According to a Dallas Morning News review of documents circulating among Texas Democrats , Dr. Paul wrote in a 1992 issue of the Ron Paul Political Report : " If you have ever been robbed by a black teenaged male , you know how unbelievably fleet of foot they can be . "
Dr. Paul , who served in Congress in the late 1970s and early 1980s , said Tuesday that he has produced the newsletter since 1985 and distributes it to an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 subscribers .
A phone call to the newsletter 's toll - free number was answered by his campaign staff . [ … ]
Dr. Paul denied suggestions that he was a racist and said he was not evoking stereotypes when he wrote the columns .
He said they should be read and quoted in their entirety to avoid misrepresentation . [… ]
" If someone challenges your character and takes the interpretation of the NAACP as proof of a man 's character , what kind of a world do you live in ? "
Dr. Paul asked .
In the interview , he did not deny he made the statement about the swiftness of black men .
" If you try to catch someone that has stolen a purse from you , there is no chance to catch them , " Dr. Paul said .
He also said the comment about black men in the nation 's capital was made while writing about a 1992 study produced by the National Center on Incarceration and Alternatives , a criminal justice think tank based in Virginia .
Citing statistics from the study , Dr. Paul then concluded in his column : " Given the inefficiencies of what DC laughingly calls the criminal justice system , I think we can safely assume that 95 percent of the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal . "
" These are n't my figures , " Dr. Paul said Tuesday .
" That is the assumption you can gather from " the report .
May 23 , 1996 , Houston Chronicle :
Paul , a Republican obstetrician from Surfside , said Wednesday he opposes racism and that his written commentaries about blacks came in the context of " current events and statistical reports of the time . " [… ]
Paul also wrote that although " we are constantly told that it is evil to be afraid of black men , it is hardly irrational .
Black men commit murders , rapes , robberies , muggings and burglaries all out of proportion to their numbers . "
A campaign spokesman for Paul said statements about the fear of black males mirror pronouncements by black leaders such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson , who has decried the spread of urban crime .
Paul continues to write the newsletter for an undisclosed number of subscribers , the spokesman said .
Writing in the same 1992 edition , Paul expressed the popular idea that government should lower the age at which accused juvenile criminals can be prosecuted as adults .
He added , " We do n't think a child of 13 should be held responsible as a man of 23 .
That 's true for most people , but black males age 13 who have been raised on the streets and who have joined criminal gangs are as big , strong , tough , scary and culpable as any adult and should be treated as such . "
Paul also asserted that " complex embezzling " is conducted exclusively by non-blacks .
" What else do we need to know about the political establishment than that it refuses to discuss the crimes that terrify Americans on grounds that doing so is racist ?
Why is n't that true of complex embezzling , which is 100 percent white and Asian ? " he wrote .
May 23 , 1996 , Austin American - Statesman :
" Dr. Paul is being quoted out of context , " [ Paul spokesman Michael ] Sullivan said .
" It 's like picking up War and Peace and reading the fourth paragraph on Page 481 and thinking you can understand what 's going on . " [ … ]
Also in 1992 , Paul wrote , " Opinion polls consistently show that only about 5 percent of blacks have sensible political opinions . "
Sullivan said Paul does not consider people who disagree with him to be sensible .
And most blacks , Sullivan said , do not share Paul 's views .
The issue is political philosophy , not race , Sullivan said .
" Polls show that only about 5 percent of people with dark - colored skin support the free market , a laissez faire economy , an end to welfare and to affirmative action , " Sullivan said . [… ]
" You have to understand what he is writing .
Democrats in Texas are trying to stir things up by using half - quotes to impugn his character , " Sullivan said .
" His writings are intellectual .
He assumes people will do their own research , get their own statistics , think for themselves and make informed judgments . "
May 26 , 1996 Washington Post :
Paul , an obstetrician from Surfside , Tex. , denied he is a racist and charged Austin lawyer Charles " Lefty " Morris , his Democratic opponent , with taking his 1992 writings out of context .
" Instead of talking about the issues , our opponent has chosen to lie and try to deceive the people of the 14th District , " said Paul spokesman Michael Sullivan , who added that the excerpts were written during the Los Angeles riots when " Jesse Jackson was making the same comments . "
" Ron knows our society and our nation has done some horrible things to the black community , which has pushed a majority of young black men in some areas , in Washington , D.C. , for example , into criminal activities , " Sullivan said .
July 25 , 1996 , Houston Chronicle :
Democratic congressional candidate Lefty Morris on Wednesday produced a newsletter in which his Republican opponent , Ron Paul , called the late Barbara Jordan a " fraud " and an " empress without clothes . " [… ]
Paul said he was expressing his " clear philosophical difference " with Jordan . [ … ]
Paul , a Surfside physician and former congressman , said he was contrasting Jordan 's political views with his own .
" The causes she so strongly advocated were for more and more government , more and more regulations and more and more taxes , " Paul said .
" My cause has been almost exactly the opposite , and I believe her positions to have been fundamentally wrong , " the Republican said .
" " I 've fought for less and less intrusive government , fewer regulations and lower taxes . "
Paul said Morris was trying to " reduce the campaign to name - calling and race - baiting " so as to avoid more relevant issues , such as economic growth , taxes and spending , crime and welfare reform .
July 25 , 1996 , Dallas Morning News :
Dr. Paul , who faces Mr. Morris in the 14th District race for the U.S. House , dismissed the criticism as " name - calling and race - baiting . " [… ]
In a written statement , Dr. Paul said , " Repeated attempts by my liberal opponent to reduce the campaign to name - calling and race - baiting is just more of the same old garbage we expect from his camp and will not deter me from continuing to address the real issues . "
Dr. Paul said his opinions about Ms. Jordan , who died earlier this year , " represented our clear philosophical difference . "
July 29 , 1996 , Roll Call :
In a statement , Paul said he had " labored to conduct a campaign based upon the issues that are vital to our nation " and charged Morris with " repeated attempts … to reduce the campaign to name calling and race - baiting . "
He called Morris 's request that he release all back issues of the newsletter " not only impractical , but …equivalent to asking him to provide documents for every lawsuit he has been involved in during his lengthy legal career . "
Of his statements about Jordan , Paul said that " such opinions represented our clear philosophical difference .
The causes she so strongly advocated were for more government , more and more regulations , and more and more taxes .
My cause has been almost exactly the opposite , and I believe her positions to have been fundamentally wrong : I 've fought for less and less intrusive government , fewer regulations , and lower taxes . "
Aug. 13 , 1996 , Houston Chronicle :
He once called former President Bush a bum and he 's taken aim at Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas , California Gov. Pete Wilson , House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia , and , yes , GOP vice - presidential candidate Jack Kemp .
Over the course of 1992 and 1993 , the GOP nominee in the 14th Congressional District has called Kemp a " malicious jerk , " and a " welfare statist " who had secretly increased the nation 's public housing budget while serving as secretary of Housing and Urban Development .
He also charged in one newsletter that Kemp had " made a pass at a female reporter young enough to be his daughter . "
Sept. 26 , 1996 , Austin American - Statesman :
" Fortunately , several types of accounts are tough for the IRS to investigate , " Paul wrote .
" For instance , it 's still legal to open a bank account without revealing your Social Security number . "
He also offered to help readers get a foreign passport .
" Peru recently announced that it will sell its citizenship to foreigners for $ 25,000 , " Paul wrote . "…
People concerned about survival are naturally interested in a second citizenship and passport .
If you 're interested , drop me a note and include your telephone number , and I 'll get you some interesting information . " [ … ]
Paul , a Surfside obstetrician , former member of Congress and 1988 Libertarian Party nominee for president , said Morris quotes material out of context .
Paul also said his advice was appropriate at the time it was published .
Sept. 30 , 1996 , San Antonio Express - News :
Paul , a Surfside obstetrician , former congressman and the 1988 Libertarian presidential candidate , counterclaimed that Morris is name - calling to avoid discussing the issues like taxes and abortion .
Repeated requests by telephone and by fax to interview Paul for this article were denied .
Paul 's spokesman Michael Quinn Sullivan said the candidate does not want to " rehash " old issues . [… ]
Paul has said he opposes racism and accused Morris of reducing the campaign to " name - calling and race - baiting . "
Oct. 11 , 1996 , Houston Chronicle :
Paul , who earlier this week said he still wrote the newsletter for subscribers , was unavailable for comment Thursday .
But his spokesman , Michael Quinn Sullivan , accused Morris of " gutter - level politics . "
Sullivan said it was " silly " to try to make a political issue of something written in an " abstract " sense . [… ]
In his April 15 , 1992 , newsletter , Paul wrote about a person who had a beef with the IRS and " fired bombs through mortars " one night at an IRS building in California .
Some federal property was damaged , but no one was injured , and the defendant was sentenced to 20 years in prison .
" Unfortunately ( the defendant 's ) war against the IRS was not nearly as successful as Harry 's War , " wrote Paul , who wants to abolish the federal tax - collection agency .
" Harry 's War " was a movie about a fictional individual 's battle against the IRS .
Sullivan said Morris " would rather sling mud at Ron Paul than talk about the issues or discuss how his own campaign is being almost completely financed by two liberal special interest groups : the trial lawyers and big labor . "
Oct. 11 , 1996 , Austin American - Statesman :
In typical marketing fashion , an extended version to the recently released Halo : Reach Beta Trailer is now out .
The message of this live action trailer says the same , but the content is double in length .
Now that Bungie is looking to get some of that Modern Warfare money times 2 with Activision , expect Microsoft to make Halo : Reach a bigger deal than it already is .
I would n’t be surprised if we see Halo : Reach limited edition Big Macs coming to McDonald ’s around the world .
Until that happens though , watch this trailer and get ready to play the beta next week on May 3 .

Celebrities love to multitask and push the envelope beyond their regular day jobs .
Movie stars try out singing careers , models become actresses , and all kinds of celebrities seem to want to try their hand at writing books .
And while most celebrity - written books just are n't worth the time , these authors have successfully made the transition from acting , hosting , and directing to writing as well .
Here are 10 celebrity writers actually worth your time away from studying .
It started with the church lady trying to get my attention in the driver ’s side mirror .
She was bobbing back and forth , hopping from foot - to - foot .
It reminded me of my dog .
I ignored her .
My boss asked another question , I could barely hear his voice .
I replied while cupping my ear .
It was hard to hear .
My connection was bad .
I was concentrating intently , the call was important .
I sensed movement to my left .
I looked up and saw the church lady smiling outside my driver ’s widow .
She was all of a foot away .
I mouthed the words “ Piss off . ”
She stayed .
I ignored her .
My call ended 3 - minutes later .
She was still there .
I removed my ear buds and started the truck .
She knocked on the window … .
I must admit counting to ten crossed my mind .
It was 8:45 am and I was already 6 calls into my day .
I was sitting in the parking lot of a 7/11 after driving 2 hours across LA for a 9:00 am meeting .
My coffee was cold , I was hungry , and I wanted nothing more than to turn on the tunes and get my head together before my first meeting of the day started .
But no ..
She knocked on my window again .
I rolled down my window .
She immediately asked if I was OK .
She was concerned .
she said I looked like I was in pain , or in trouble , or in need of somebody to talk to .
I asked , “ What do you want ? ”
“ I want to share to love of Jesus with you .
With Jesus , all your pain will be … ” I stopped her .
“ Unless he can make a crapload of work go away , I ’m not interested . ”
She tried to hand me a pamphlet .
I stopped her again .
She started talking again , this time more urgently , “ Sir , you need to hear this .
It could change your life ! ”
My response was terse , “ No Seriously , get out of my face . ”
I backed out of the parking stall .
She walked along beside me while trying to hand me a bible tract .
I rolled up my window before she could drop it on me .
As I pull away , I see her approach another loner in the parking lot .
I watch as she starts to hop from foot - to - foot , her dance of seduction rebooting for another try .
I sigh .
This was my second run-in with a proselytizing Christian in 24 - hours .
The day before a man had tried to tell me God had arranged for him to talk to me because I was obviously in pain .
I ’m not even going into that one .
It was insane .
I ’m sick of this shit .
The Case Against Goldman Sachs 11:15 AM ET
Wed , 21 April 2010
According to documents , a government official asked Pellegrini whether he informed ACA manager Laura Schwartz about Paulson 's position in the portfolio , named Abacus 2007 - AC1 .
Pellegrini said there were at least three meetings with Schwartz and that he told her during at least one of them either what type of securities Paulson wanted in the portfolio or that the hedge fund intended to short them .
One meeting took place at a ski lodge bar in Jackson Hole , WY .
In a statement to CNBC on Wednesday , SEC spokesman John Nester said : " Our case is built on a thorough evidentiary record that includes testimony , documents , hand - written notes and emails and will be presented in court at the appropriate time . "
Neither Pellegrini nor Paulson & Co has been accused of wrongdoing .
Pellegrini has declined to comment to CNBC .
In one part of Pellegrini 's testimony , a government official asked him : " Did you tell ( Schwartz ) that you were interested in taking a short position in Abacus ? "
" Yes , that was the purpose of the meeting , " Pellegrini responded .
" How did you explain that to her ? " the government official said .
" That we wanted to buy protection on traunches of a synthetic RMBS portfolio . "
Pellegrini said .
The SEC does not mention this exchange in its complaint against Goldman .
While Predator drones prove their mettle in Afghanistan and Pakistan , a new generation of far smaller flying robots is taking shape in various labs .
These micro­­fliers may soon take on a variety of military missions and innovative humanitarian ones as well .
At the University of Waterloo in Ontario , microroboticist Behrad Khamesee has developed a flying robot about the size of a pencil eraser .
A pair of laser - operated , fingerlike grippers allow the bot to grasp and release small objects .
The device operates wirelessly , powered by a magnetic field .
Kha­mesee hopes a version of the robot will someday zip around inside the human body delivering targeted drugs ; first he needs to reduce the jitters in the bot ’s motion .

Mechanical engineer Haibo Dong of Wright State University in Ohio is working on a four - winged robot called the Wright Dragonflyer .
The design is more difficult to create than a two - winged flapping system but promises greater speed and maneuverability .
Dong expects to have a prototype , about the size of a real dragonfly , completed this year .
“ This small craft could perform surveillance , environmental monitoring , and search and rescue , ” he says .
Another insect - inspired robot is taking shape at Harvard University , where roboticist Robert Wood is building on his 2007 development of a life - size mechanical fly to create a colony of RoboBees .
These swarming robots will incorporate optical and chemical sensors as well as communication systems to make autonomous flight decisions and to coordinate with colony members during tasks such as searching for objects or people .
The military is in on the game too .
The U.S. Army is teaming up with BAE Systems and academic partners , including the University of Maryland and the University of Pennsylvania , to build microfliers for intelligence and surveillance through its Micro Autonomous Systems and Technology Collaborative Alliance .
“ Our long - term goal is to develop technologies that can produce a map of a building interior or detect bombs , ” says manager Joseph Mait of the Army Research Laboratory .
Current prototypes include a sparrow - size flapping - wing craft and four - blade helicopter - style robots .
The consortium will convene this spring with potential users in the Army to review the current state of the technologies .
The Air Force is preparing to launch the X - 37B spacecraft to perform unspecified technology tests in orbit and then autonomously glide on stubby wings to a landing on a California runway .
( AP ) --
An unmanned Air Force space plane resembling a small space shuttle has been launched on its maiden voyage into orbit , carried aloft aboard an Atlas 5 rocket Thursday evening , the service announced .
The rocket carrying the reusable X - 37B Orbital Test Vehicle lifted off at 7:52 p.m. EDT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , an Air Force statement said .
It called the launch of the winged spacecraft a success , but released no immediate details of the mission 's progress .
The space plane is to serve as a test platform for unspecified experiments and can stay in orbit for up to 270 days before gliding to an autonomous runway landing , the Air Force has said .
The primary landing site is Vandenberg Air Force Base on the California coast northwest of Los Angeles .
The mission length was n't disclosed by the Air Force .
The service has made public only a general description of the mission objectives : testing of guidance , navigation , control , thermal protection and autonomous operation in orbit , re-entry and landing .
However , the ultimate purpose of the X - 37B and details about the craft have longed remained a mystery , though experts said the spacecraft was intended to speed up development of combat - support systems and weapons systems .
" This launch helps ensure that our warfighters will be provided the capabilities they need in the future , " said Col .
Andre Lovett , a launch official and vice commander of the Air Force 's 45th Space Wing , in Thursday 's statement .
The launch culminated the project 's long and expensive journey from NASA to the Pentagon 's research and development arm and then on to the secretive Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office .
Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on the X - 37 program , but the current total has n't been released .
While the massive space shuttles have been likened to cargo - hauling trucks , the X - 37B is more like a sports car , with the equivalent trunk capacity .
Built by Boeing Co.'s Phantom Works , the 11,000 - pound craft is 9 1 / 2 feet tall and just over 29 feet long , with a wingspan of less than 15 feet .
It has two angled tail fins rather than a single vertical stabilizer .
Unlike the shuttle , it was designed for launch like a satellite , housed in a fairing atop the expendable Atlas V rocket , and capable of deploying solar panels to provide electrical power in orbit .

The New Jersey Devils have won the Ilya Kovalchuk sweepstakes , acquiring the superstar winger from the Atlanta Thrashers on Thursday night .
The Devils have struggled of late , especially scoring goals .
Devils GM
Lou Lamoriello did n't hesitate , swooping in and acquiring the biggest rental player available on this year 's trade market .
In exchange , the Thrashers get rookie forward Niclas Bergfors , defenseman Johnny Oduya , prospect Patrice Cormier and a first - round pick in this year 's draft .
" It 's a bittersweet day but it 's behind us and now we have to move forward , " Atlanta general manager Don Waddell said of trading the Thrashers ' captain .
Oduya has two more years on his deal after this season at a $ 3.5 million salary - cap hit .
Bergfors will be a restricted free agent July 1 .
Cormier was suspended for the rest of the season in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League for an elbowing incident but he 's a highly regarded prospect .
In addition to Kovalchuk , New Jersey also gets defenseman Anssi Salmela , who was originally a Devil and sent to Atlanta at the trade deadline last year .
The teams also exchanged second - round draft picks in this year 's draft .
Lamoriello noted that while the Devils gave up a lot , they have the depth in the organization to overcome it .
He also noted that the Devils ' recent scoring slump played a part .
" We felt Kovalchuk was a player who could come and fill the need that we felt we had for an explosive scorer and someone who could add a different dimension to our power play with the type of shot , " Lamoriello said .
" Then it was just the case of trying to make it work somehow where we could not sacrifice tomorrow . "
Lamoriello said the Devils have not spoken to Kovalchuk about an extension .
He will become a free agent after this season .
Lamoriello said Kovalchuk is expected to play Friday night when the Devils host the Toronto Maple Leafs .
Kovalchuk had 31 goals and 27 assists in 49 games this season for the Thrashers .
He missed six games because of a broken bone in his foot .
" The power that he brings ; he is a power forward , he has hockey sense and he knows how to make other people around him better , " Lamoriello said .
" You can tell by the assists he gets .
I am sure every one of you has seen him play .
What he brings , he can do things a lot of people can't do . "
Lamoriello does n't expect Kovalcuk will have a problem fitting into the Devils ' team system .
The Devils ' last major trade to acquire a scorer was in 2000 when they got Alexander Mogilny from the Vancouver Canucks .
The Devils won the Stanley Cup that season .
" The reason we got Alex at that time was for similar reasons :
What he could bring offensively with the shot he had and he could do almost individually at times but still be a team player , " Lamoriello said .
" I feel that Ilya can bring that sort of explosiveness and also I really believe strongly that he wants to win . "
The Devils ' roster should be bolstered in the next few weeks with the return of forwards Patrik Elias ( concussion ) and David Clarkson ( ankle ) from injury .
Defenseman Paul Martin is expected to return from a broken left forearm after the Olympic break .
The 28 - year - old Oduya has two goals and two assists in 40 games this season .
He 's set to play for Sweden in Olympics .
Bergfors , a 22 - year - old Swede , is fifth among NHL rookies with 27 points ( 13 goals , 14 assists ) .
He was drafted 23rd overall in 2005 .
The 19 - year - old Cormier had 11 goals and 20 assists in 31 games this season with Rimouski and Rouyn - Noranda of the QMJHL .
He captained Canada in the 2010 World Junior Championship .
" I did n't say we 're a better team , but if you watch what 's happened , we have n't had great success on the ice , " Waddell said of the Thrashers after the trade .
" It 's not Ilya 's fault .
It 's the team 's fault , but we 're excited about the future and moving forward . "
Salmela , 25 , had a goal and four assists in 29 games this season for Atlanta .
The Finn was acquired by the Thrashers from the Devils in exchange for defenseman Niclas Havelid and forward Myles Stoesz on March 2 , 2009 .
Since the Thrashers drafted Kovalchuk No. 1 overall in 2001 , the Russian Olympian leads the NHL with 328 goals , but Atlanta , an expansion team that debuted in 1999 - 2000 , has made just one playoff appearance and has never won a postseason game .
" We 're struggling with our attendance as it is , " Waddell said .
" The only way we 're going to brings fans back is by winning hockey games . "
The Devils lead the Atlantic Division and are in second place in the Eastern Conference standings .
The deal was made hours after Waddell said the franchise would aggressively explore all its options after Kovalchuk rejected a 12 - year , $ 101 million extension .
" We got to a point where we offered the player one deal that was in excess of $ 100 million , " Waddell said .
" We have n't won a playoff game here .
We have to build this team with that in mind . "
Waddell said that if the franchise had met Kovalchuk 's salary demands , it would have jeopardized its ability to build a competitive team around him and to retain other young players as they became eligible for new contracts in the seasons ahead .
" I think Kovy right to the last day wanted to be a Thrasher , but again , it becomes a business decision , " Waddell said .
" In a cap world , you have to make all the pieces fit and if you have one player taking all the room under the cap , it 's hard to get all the young pieces to fit as well .
...
" I think it does n't set us back at all .
We picked up some nice pieces today , some nice assets .
It 's one of those moves you do n't look forward to making but we were forced to make it . "

Maybe the right - wing bent of Fox News is just a mistake ?
Maybe Rupert Murdoch just does n't know what a liberal is ?
During an interview in the UK DC , the News Corp chairman could n't name a single Democrat on Fox .
Murdoch wanted to talk about hating Google ( because he is a cranky old man ) and how the iPad will save newspapers ( because he is a delusional old man ) , but the interviewer totally went there with a Fox News question .
Murdoch insisted that Fox covers " both sides , " but he could not actually back that up with examples .
Asked to name a single Democrat - leaning Fox commentator – alongside such conservative names as Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly – he struggled openly to remember one .
" I wish I could tell you a couple of names .
But they are certainly there , " he said .
He eventually settled on the Fox host Greta van Susteren , whom he said was " close " to the Democratic party .
Greta ! Greta van Susteren .
Her father was a close friend of Joe McCarthy .
Her husband is an advisor for Sarah Palin .
Anyone who watches her show ( or reads her hilarious blog ) knows she totally wants to gay marry Sarah .
( And Todd ! )
Poor Rupert .
Maybe he 's confused the Democratic party with the Church of Scientology ?

Washington ( CNN ) --
Salt , a staple in most food , could soon be regulated if the Institute of Medicine has its way .
In a new report , the institute , the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences , is calling on the Food and Drug Administration to set national standards for salt added to processed foods and prepared meals in an effort to reduce Americans ' consumption of sodium .
Salt consumption , long associated with increased risk of hypertension , heart disease and stroke , would be cut back gradually through a series of incremental reductions intended to help keep flavors consistent .
The new standards would set how much salt food manufacturers and restaurants could add to their products .
The Institute of Medicine says that a ban on salt is not necessary but that regulation is , because decades of public education campaigns have failed to reduce Americans ' intake .
" For 40 years , we have known about the relationship between sodium and the development of hypertension and other life - threatening diseases , but we have had virtually no success in cutting back the salt in our diets , " said institute committee Chairwoman Jane Henney , professor of medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in Ohio .
" This report outlines strategies that will enable all of us to effectively lower our sodium consumption to healthy levels .
Lowering sodium by the food industry in a stepwise , monitored fashion will minimize changes in flavor and still provide adequate amounts of this essential nutrient that are compatible with good health . "
Read about a New England Journal of Medicine study on salt intake
Food and Drug Administration officials have begun industry conversations about voluntary reduction and are encouraged by the response , the agency says .
But no decision has been made to regulate salt .
An FDA spokesman said that consensus is needed to reduce Americans ' daily salt intake but that officials still do n't know the best path to getting there .
" Today 's average sodium intake is several times what the body requires and its long - term effects are very serious , " an FDA statement said .
" Over the coming weeks , the FDA will more thoroughly review the recommendations of the IOM report and build plans for how the FDA can continue to work with other federal agencies , public health and consumer groups , and the food industry to support the reduction of sodium levels in the food supply . "
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will establish a group to review options and next steps , the FDA said .
Health and Human Services recommends that adults limit their daily salt intake to 2,300 milligrams : about 1 teaspoon .
If you are over 40 , are African - American or have high blood pressure , you should n't have more than 1,500 mg a day .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , nearly 70 percent of adults fall into one or more of these three categories .
The average American consumes far more , however , eating about 3,900 milligrams of sodium a day .
In a study last month from Stanford University , researchers found that reducing the country 's salt intake by 9.5 percent could reduce nearly half a million strokes and heart attacks and save more than $ 32 billion in medical costs over the lifetime of adults .
More on why reducing salt intake is good
Along with mandatory national standards , the Institute of Medicine is recommending voluntary reductions by the food industry and urging government agencies such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture to revise and update nutrition labels .
The institute says that because the new regulations will take time to implement , food and beverage manufacturers , restaurants and food service companies should voluntarily begin reducing levels in foods .
The Center for Science in the Public Interest has been pressing federal officials for more than 30 years to take measures to reduce salt in packaged and restaurant foods .
" Limiting salt in packaged and restaurant foods is perhaps the single most important thing that the Food and Drug Administration could do to save hundreds of thousands of lives and save billions of dollars in health care expenses , " center Executive Director Michael Jacobson said .
" As the Institute of Medicine report unambiguously points out , 40 years of voluntary initiatives on the part of manufacturers have failed to reduce salt intake .
We call on food manufacturers and restaurant chains to step up their efforts at voluntary salt reduction while the FDA and USDA implement the IOM 's recommendations . "
The Grocery Manufacturers Association says that 's something its member companies have been working on for at least a decade .
The group says " silent reduction " or incremental reductions over the years is not new .
CookingLight.com : A 'less is more ' approach to sodium
" For years , food companies have been introducing a wide variety of new products into the marketplace containing no sodium or low sodium or with no added salt , " Brian Kennedy , the association 's communications director , said in a statement .
" During that time , food companies have been very successful at making incremental reductions in sodium levels in food products that maintain consumer taste preferences .
The food industry is committed to continue to reduce the sodium content in thousands of products to help consumers reach the U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommendation of no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day . "
The Salt Institute , which represents salt producers , says that instituting a one - size - fits - all policy on sodium could hurt some consumers .
" The science simply does n't back up these recommendations .
Should the federal government regulate consumption of very low levels of salt , they are effectively compelling the entire population take part in the largest clinical trial ever carried out , without their knowledge or consent , " said Lori Roman , president of the Salt Institute .
" There will be negative unintended consequences , including the introduction of substitutes , which consumers may find much less desirable than salt , which has been consumed safely for thousands of years . "
Should we blame it on the Massa Moment ?
Will that Hindenburg performance soon be seen as the turning point for Glenn Beck : the pivotal moment when the Fox News show began to permanently leak viewers ?
Who can forget the March day that will live in cable news infamy , when Beck invited embattled Democratic Congressman Eric Massa onto his show , for an entire hour , to blow the whistle on Democratic Party corruption ?
Or so Beck thought .
Instead , Massa went on and on about tickle fights , and Beck became a laughing stock -- the butt of endless Geraldo - opens - Al - Capone 's - vault jokes .
Prior to the Massa Moment , Glenn Beck was averaging 2.6 million viewers each week , and the show was still flying high .
And in the short term , the wildly hyped Massa episode produced ratings gold , generating 3.4 million viewers that night , thank you very much .
Long - term though , the effects have proven to be disastrous .
As I noted two weeks ago , Glenn Beck 's ratings are down this spring .
Now it 's clear those declines are accelerating and there are no signs of a rebound .
So what does that mean for Beck , Fox News , and the Tea Party movement ?
First , the latest Nielsen low : Glenn Beck just posted another ratings low for this year .
The new mark was set last Thursday when the show attracted 1.82 million viewers .
The host 's previous , non-vacation low for 2010 had been 1.97 million viewers .
That low - ebb mark was set on April 9 .
Based on the Nielsen numbers , here 's a look at Beck 's average daily viewership over the last five weeks .
( Any weekend re-broadcasts , as well as weekday shows when Beck was on vacation , are not included in the tabulation . )
( The temporary spike shown above represents the day after health care reform passed in the Congress . )
Let 's put Beck 's ratings into context .
Yes , in the world of cable news , his numbers are impressive , and virtually any host would be happy to have them .
But look how far Glenn Beck has fallen recently .
In late January and into February , the program was averaging 3 million viewers each week .
And late last year , the show spent month after month flirting with that figure .
Today , the viewership is trending around 2 million ( Last week it was exactly 2.01 million viewers . ) -- which means that in a span of just three months , Glenn Beck has lost nearly one - third of its television audience .
My take ?
Those missing one million are n't coming back .
Not permanently anyway .
Meaning , this is not a temporary hiccup for Glenn Beck , and the host is not likely to see a V - shaped recovery in terms of the show 's ratings .
Beck mania seems to have peaked .
At least on TV .
Will the show enjoy occasional audience spikes ?
Sure .
But I doubt they will be sustainable .
And that has to be sending up all kinds of red flags inside Fox News , which already struggles to find any big -name advertisers to fill out the commercials on the controversial show .
Keep in mind , there are more than 200 companies that have gone on the record as saying they will not buy ad time on Glenn Beck 's show .
Applebee's ?
No. AT&T ? No. Bank of America ?
No. Best Buy , Campbell Soup , CVS , Ditech , Farmers Insurance Group , GEICO , General Mills , Johnson & Johnson , Lowe's , Nutrisystem , Procter & Gamble , Progressive Insurance , RadioShack , Sprint , State Farm Insurance , The UPS Store , Travelers Insurance , Verizon Wireless , Vonage , or Wal - Mart ?
No .
Corporate America ( aka the beloved free marketplace ) wants nothing to do with Beck .
( Sort of like the NFL wanted nothing to do with Rush Limbaugh last year . )
Today , there are less than a handful of nationally recognized advertisers who appear willing to purchase air time on Glenn Beck .
Think about the deep , deep discounts
Fox News likely has to offer the remaining advertisers in order to get them to come aboard .
( And the show is supposed to be a hit . )
Now add to that equation the fact that Glenn Beck has lost 1/3 of its audience since January , and you can see where this is heading for Fox News .
How soft are Beck 's current ratings ?
He 's now posting the type of numbers that his show used to get when he was on vacation and somebody less famous stood in for him , like when he took a few days off in late March and his show averaged 1.9 million viewers .
Beck 's been back from his March vacation for weeks now , but his ratings are roughly the same as when he was n't even there .
What 's so amazing about the stampede away from Beck 's show is that the political landscape has not changed during that time .
In fact , according to press accounts , the Tea Party movement that Beck is so closely aligned with is supposedly in the midst of a surge in momentum and enthusiasm .
So why is Glenn Beck losing viewers ?
It 's odd because Beck 's nemesis , President Barack Obama , is still in office and still doing his best , in the Beck worldview , to ruin America from within .
Democrats are still in charge of Congress and still , in the Beck worldview , ripping up the Constitution .
It 's not like the evil Democratic threat is gone .
Beck 's bogeymen remain in place .
It 's just that one - third of his audience has lost interest and has checked out .
What 's wrong with Glenn Beck ?
And why are viewers fleeing the show ?
Obviously , I 'm not the target demo , but I will now admit that there were times last fall and in early winter when Beck 's show did have a kind of demented , " Oh wow " factor to it , and I tuned in regularly just to see what he'd say and do next .
The program did , at times , make for compelling television .
But today , making it through one of his insufferable , redundant shows feels like sitting through detention .
The wow factor is long gone .
Whatever originality the show once had has been replaced with a suffocating sense of sameness as Beck 's expanding ego seems to have completely taken control of the operation .
Which brings us back to the Massa Moment , and the absurd broadcasting notion that Beck could generate interesting television for an entire hour while interviewing a congressman he barely even knew .
i.e. recipe for disaster .
And yes ,
Beck seems to know that the lecture - like shows he now produces , complete with unreadable chalkboards , do n't make for good TV .
Last week he jokingly conceded , " This is the worst television ever done .
We 're doing it every day , congratulations . "
Beck appears to be trapped in something of a programming box .
If he continues to just keep saying the same thing day after day , more viewers are likely to flee .
If he goes long and risks his shows on ridiculous Massa - like interviews , more viewers are likely to be turned off .
But who knows , maybe it was n't the Massa flame - out that drove viewers away .
Instead , maybe it was Beck 's hateful and irresponsible attack on Christianity , and specifically Catholicism , in which he urged parishioners to leave their church -- during the Easter season -- if their church mentioned " social justice , " which Beck announced was akin to communism and Nazism .
Maybe that 's what opened the Fox News floodgates , as offended viewers forced their way out .
Or maybe it's been a combination of Beck 's incessant whining , married with his delusional conspiracies and his hateful rhetoric that simply do not appeal to people outside of his most hardcore , fanatical , Obama - hating followers .
And maybe in the end that group only numbers 1 - 1.5 million viewers .
Or maybe the sagging numbers represent the let - down that came after Beck 's flock watched health care reform pass ; the same reform that the GOP Noise Machine had pronounced dead all winter long and that had no chance of passing .
( Oops ! )
Oh , and did I mention Beck 's runaway ego ?
As Media Matters ' Ben Dimiero wrote last week :
Capping a week in which he attempted to explain the " plan " he " think [s ] "
God wants him to " articulate , " Glenn Beck informed listeners of his radio show today that " an individual " at the Vatican purportedly told him that we are entering a " period of great darkness " and that Beck himself was " wildly important " to the upcoming struggle .
Okaaay .
Whatever the possible causes of the exodus , Nielsen numbers do n't lie about the concrete effects .
Jed Lewison recently pointed out at DailyKos that Beck 's April ratings this year are actually slightly lower than April 2009 , when the whole Tea Party movement was just getting off the ground [ emphasis original ] :
From April 1 to April 14 , 2009 ( the two weeks immediately preceding tea party 2009 ) the Glenn Beck show averaged 2.23 million viewers .
Meanwhile , from April 1 to April 14 , 2010 his show averaged 2.15 million viewers . [...]
That 's not a dramatic decline , and Beck clearly still has a loyal audience .
But his audience is not growing .
That 's right , year - to - date , Beck 's audience is not growing .
Despite all the media attention , the cover stories on Beck and the endless reporting of the Tea Party movement he supposedly leads , over the last 12 months , Beck has not grown his TV audience .
Well , he grew it , and then lost it again , while managing to lose 200 advertisers as well .
In fact , if the precipitous Glenn Beck ratings trend continues , the show will soon be regularly attracting many , many fewer viewers than it did 12 months ago -- an astonishing turn of events for a signature show that 's supposed to be at the forefront of a political revolution .

In his slate - blue suit and Republican - red tie , John Yoo stands out as discordantly formal among the denim - and turtleneck - clad faculty at Boalt Hall School of Law .
Never mind how his politics play in what he derides as “ the People ’s Republic of Berkeley . ”
FOR THE RECORD :
John Yoo :
An article in Section A on March 29 about legal guidance written by UC Berkeley law professor John C. Yoo and Circuit Judge Jay S. Bybee when they were Justice Department lawyers in the George W. Bush administration said their advice “ redefined torture as pain resulting in organ failure or death . ”
Their guidance defined torture as pain that “ must rise to the level of death , organ failure , ” but did not restrict it to acts that would actually result in organ failure or death . —
The former Bush administration lawyer who drafted what his critics call the “ torture memos ” is reviled by many in this liberal East Bay academic enclave , a feeling that is mutual though not , Yoo insists , wholly unpleasant .
“ I think of myself as being West Berlin during the Cold War , a shining beacon of capitalism and democracy surrounded by a sea of Marxism , ” Yoo observes , sipping iced tea in the faculty club lounge , a wan smile registering the discomfort of colleagues walking by en route to the bar .
He sees his neighbors as the human figures of “ a natural history museum of the 1960s , ” the Telegraph Avenue tableau of a graying , long - haired , pot-smoking counterculture stuck in the ideology ’s half - century - old heyday .
“ It ’s like looking at the panoramic displays of troglodytes sitting around the campfire with their clubs .
Here , it ’s tie - dye and marijuana .
It ’s just like the 1960s , with the Vietnam War still to protest . ”
Yoo , 42 , is unrepentant about his role in providing the CIA and other agencies with legal cover to conduct harsh interrogation of terror suspects with techniques such as water - boarding , which simulates drowning .
In legal guidance he provided to the past administration , Yoo redefined torture as pain resulting in organ failure or death .
Calls for his ouster have n’t subsided despite a Department of Justice decision in February that neither Yoo nor his former boss in the Bush administration Office of Legal Counsel , federal Circuit Judge Jay S. Bybee , will face prosecution for advice to the administration that showed “ poor judgment ” but not willful breaking of the law .
Liberal civil rights advocates like the Center for Constitutional Rights , the American Civil Liberties Union and the Alliance for Justice have demanded a full , independent investigation of Yoo and Bybee for their roles in the sanctioning of interrogation tactics the Obama administration has outlawed as violations of international treaties and U.S. moral values .
“ I feel vindicated , ” Yoo said of the Justice Department internal affairs report that concluded a five - year investigation and dropped an earlier recommendation that he and Bybee be subjected to disciplinary action by their respective state bar associations .
Yoo sees the investigation as political score - settling by those who disagreed with the tough war - on - terror policies of the Bush White House .
“ Someday the Republicans will be in charge again , and would you want to see them conducting ethics and criminal investigations into the Obama administration ? ” he says .
“ I would n’t want to see that .
So I hope that this closes this chapter in trying to use criminal and ethical charges to carry out political fights against the policy of a past administration . ”
He sees the persistent protests of his fitness to teach law as the campaign of a radical community intolerant of views that do n’t accord with their own .
After disclosure of the memos last year , Christopher Edley , the law school ’s dean , deflected demands that he fire
Yoo , saying that he and other university administrators would wait for the Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibilities report and then “ review it carefully and consider whether there are implications for this campus . ”
Edley has said little since the Feb. 19 report that both detailed Yoo ’s and Bybee ’s misdeeds and eliminated an earlier finding that the lawyers had engaged in professional misconduct .
“ I hope these new developments will end the arguments about faculty sanctions , but we should and will continue to argue about what is right or wrong , legal or illegal , in combating terrorism .
That ’s why we are here , ” Edley said in a statement after the report was released .
Though Berkeley ’s faculty remains predominantly liberal , it has become more ideologically diverse over the years as the best minds , regardless of political bent , have been picked to build the nation ’s well - respected computer science program , engineering school and law school , which is considered one of the best in the country .
Many of Yoo ’s faculty colleagues have spoken out on the need for representing a wide range of viewpoints .
Among those deflecting calls for Yoo ’s dismissal was fellow law professor Goodwin Liu , whom Obama has nominated for the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals .
Students also represent a broad array of political outlooks , although critics of Yoo ’s work for the Bush administration have dominated the debate over his tenured position .
“ We do n’t want someone like that teaching us about the law and how to apply the law .
It ’s a humiliation for the law school and a huge disservice to the law students , ” said Liz Jackson , co-chair of the Boalt Hall chapter of the National Lawyers Guild .
“ We are a very prestigious place to be , and he gets a lot of legitimacy from being here and having a respected platform from which to speak . ”
Yoo carries on cheerfully with his constitutional law class and a seminar on which he has bestowed the assignment to write a manual for delegates to a state constitutional convention , should one be called .
He points out that 180 students enrolled in his civil procedure class last semester , as evidence that he is hardly being shunned by the students .
Critics contend , though , that only two professors offered the course and that it was the last opportunity for this year ’s graduates to take the class .
Yoo seems more amused than uncomfortable as the center of controversy .
He speculates that much of the student body leans left as well , having “ self - selected ” UC Berkeley for its reputation as a liberal bastion .
He does n’t detect open resistance to his position , the occasional protest or invasion of his classroom notwithstanding .
“ Maybe they have the idea that it would be interesting to see what a conservative professor is like , ” he says of the law school students who take his classes .
“ Then they can always say , ‘ I ’ve met a conservative . ’
They can tell their family and friends . ”
He does n’t seek to change his students ’ thinking , he says .
“ I do n’t really care whether they agree with me or not .
I do n’t care whether they follow me or not .
Our mission is to make them better thinkers , ” he says .
“ I would be just as pleased if one of my students became a Democratic [ appointed ] Supreme Court justice . ”
Despite his rocky passage from government back to Berkeley , where he has taught off and on since 1993 , Yoo does n’t rule out a return to public service should Republican conservatives regain the White House .
Though he says he much prefers the freedom and intellectual stimulation of a college campus , he says he believes anyone called to serve the country should do so .
“ My parents were immigrants .
I could have been a convenience store manager , ” the South Korean - born professor says of the opportunities afforded by his adopted country .
“ I feel very fortunate to have a job like this one . ”
In addition to his legal work for the Bush administration , Yoo served as general counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee and was a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas .
Having experience in all three branches of government has given him a solid background from which to draw in his teachings , he said .
“ Besides , my wife has forbidden us from moving .
She likes it here , ” he says of Elsa Arnett , a writer he met at Harvard University while studying for his undergraduate degree in American history .
She is the daughter of Pulitzer Prize - winning former foreign correspondent Peter Arnett , whose political views make for spirited family get - togethers ,
Yoo says of his opinionated father - in - law .
Yoo seems at peace living in Berkeley , even though he disparages the community as an enclave of self - satisfied extremists intolerant of those who think outside the liberal mind - set .
“ But that does n’t mean I do n’t like it here , ” he says .

Representative Bennie Thompson , Democrat of Mississippi and chairman of the committee , questioned whether it was time to pull the plug entirely .
“ We still need to see whether or not this virtual fence that was promised by the department and its contractor Boeing is something that is feasible , ” he said Tuesday .
“ Or is it just a several - hundred - million - dollar waste of taxpayer money ? ”
The virtual fence is part of a multiyear , multibillion - dollar effort known as the Secure Border Initiative that was announced with fanfare by the Bush administration in November 2005 .
Besides increasing the number of guards and expanding a border wall , it promised a sophisticated system of cameras , sensors and radar that would zero in on people crossing the border with new speed and clarity and quickly guide agents to them .
By now , according to the original timeline , the system was supposed to be working along the 2,000 - mile border with Mexico .
But shortly after Boeing was awarded the contract , red flags went up over its lack of oversight and potential for cost overruns .
Boeing said in a statement on Tuesday that it was “ fully committed to delivering border - security technology that successfully assists ” the department , but it declined to answer questions about its handling of the project .
About $ 1.1 billion has been spent on the virtual fence , with little to show for it beyond the two testing sites in the Arizona desert and a series of embarrassments , including radar that could not function properly in the rain and wind - blown trees mistaken for border crossers .
BANGKOK — A major hospital in Bangkok evacuated hundreds of its patients on Friday and shut down all but emergency services after scores of antigovernment protesters pushed their way inside and roamed the halls in what they said was a hunt for soldiers who might be hiding there .
The men , who have been camping nearby , withdrew empty - handed , and protest leaders quickly apologized , distancing themselves from the raid , which was an embarrassment to a movement that portrays itself as nonviolent .
Dr. Adisorn Patradul , director of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital , said almost all of its 500 patients were either discharged or transferred to other hospitals .
By evening , the hospital was dark and silent except for one emergency room .
“ On behalf of all leaders , I apologize to the public and to Chulalongkorn Hospital , ” said Weng Tojirakarn , a protest leader who is a doctor .
“ The situation got out of control .
It is not our policy to obstruct hospital operations . ”
· ' Flying wing ' could be in the air by 2030 · Design would reduce fuel use , say engineers
Engineers have unveiled what they hope is the future for commercial airliners - a radical " flying wing " designed to be so quiet that no one outside an airport will be able to hear it .
The SAX - 40 would be 25 % more fuel - efficient than modern planes and carry 215 passengers up to 5,000 nautical miles ( 5,750 miles ) at a maximum speed of 600 mph .
The blended wing design concept , which could come into commercial service by 2030 , is a result of the £ 2.3 m Silent Aircraft Initiative ( SAI ) , a three - year collaboration between Cambridge University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
" It 's got a bold aim - by starting from scratch to design an airplane that has noise reduction as a major design consideration - so quiet that its noise would be imperceptible outside an urban airport in the daytime , " said Ann Dowling of Cambridge University , who led the British side of the project .
Though airliners have been in commercial service for more than half a century their basic design has not changed .
A tube - like fuselage with engines hanging under the wings has been the default design because it can be easily scaled up and down in size and is easy to maintain .
Blending the fuselage and wing has been confined mostly to military planes such as long - range stealth bombers .
Engineers chose this shape for the SAX - 40 because it is more aerodynamic and produces less air turbulence over the body , hence less noise .
Using hundreds of microphones , engineers tested the sound produced by many of the new components .
Their simulations predicted the aircraft noise would be 63 decibels at the airport perimeter , the equivalent of standing on a busy street .
" It 's the integral system design that enables the low noise and not one particular technology , " said Zoltan Spakovsky of MIT .
The primary noise reduction idea has been to put the engines above the body of the aircraft .
This allows the fuselage to screen the noise from the ground by reflecting sound waves upwards .
The wings have been simplified , removing the need for flaps and slats - a major source of noise when a plane lands .
" On approach to land the flow over the wings and the landing gear produces much of the noise , " said Dr Spakovsky .
Half of the noise an aircraft makes on its approach to a runway is produced this way , and the faster it approaches the more noise it makes .
The blended wing of the SAX - 40 means the whole body provides lift for the aircraft , allowing it to make a slower approach .
Other ideas include lining the engines with sound - absorbing materials and making them longer so that acoustic mufflers can be added on to the ends .
They also have adjustable exhaust nozzles that keep noise down at takeoff but open up at cruising altitude to maximise fuel efficiency .
" We set a major target for low noise but at the beginning of the project we did n't know what the impact would be for fuel burn , " said Prof Dowling .
" This design has reduced fuel burn and noise but probably if we scrapped the noise we could go still further in terms of reduced fuel burn . "
The engineers calculated that the SAX - 40 would achieve 149 passenger miles per gallon compared with 121 for a Boeing 777 .
By comparison a Toyota Prius hybrid car gets 144 passenger miles per gallon .
John Green of Greener by Design , which promotes sustainable aviation , said he was initially sceptical of the silent aircraft initiative .
" Three years on I have to concede that the SAI has surpassed my expectations by quite a margin , " he said .
" The team has produced a high - risk but credible design . "
The conceptual design will now be carried forward by the industrial partners in the silent aircraft initiative .
Several dozen companies were involved , including Boeing , Rolls - Royce and British Airways .
Further development of the SAX - 40 into a commercial airliner could take several decades - the new Airbus A380 , for example , took 17 years to design and build .
" This is a conceptual design and there are many technological barriers that need to be overcome to introduce these technologies into commercial use , " said Cesare Hall , an engineer at Cambridge University .
He outlined challenges such as developing the strong composite materials needed to produce the oval - shaped hull and improving modern jet engines to work with the SAX - 40 design .
Prof Dowling said : " What we 've shown here is the kinds of technologies and trade - offs and advantages they might bring .
There are significant technical challenges to be overcome if we 're to see an aircraft based on that concept .
" Some of the individual technologies one might see on more conventional looking aircraft in the nearer future . "
A former ASB banker who stole $ 18 million from customers and blew $ 3.4 million of it on prostitutes has been sentenced to six years in jail .
Stephen Gerard Versalko , 52 , married with three children , lived the high life for nine years after scalping $ 17,763,110 off 26 wealthy ASB clients .
SFO prosecutor Patrick McCann said Versalko had paid $ 3.4 m to two female Auckland prostitutes over the course of the nine years .
Versalko's lawyer Stuart Grieve QC claimed at least part of that was extorted from Versalko by one of the women who tried to blackmail the banker - though the SFO says it knows nothing about any blackmail .
He preyed on elderly women who lived overseas and were unsophisticated about money , SFO prosecutor Patrick McCann told the court .
Versalko , wearing a short sleeved top and pin stripe pants , was sentenced to six years jail by judge Chris Field in the Auckland District Court , eligible for parole after four years .
The judge said it would have been higher , except Versalko admitted the crimes early and helped the SFO unpick his web of money transactions and enable the recovery of $ 4 m .
Amongst other perks he bought himself from the fraud was a $ 3.2 million home in plush Remuera .
He also scored himself a $ 1.8 million beach front holiday home at Whangapoua in the Coromandel .
A senior investment adviser , he was finally caught out when one of the ASB clients saw a documentary on jailed US fraudster Bernie Madoff and became suspicious of Versalko .
She realised Versalko was the only person from the ASB she had any contact with about her investments - which promised higher than normal interest , no tax and no fees .
She rang the bank , which soon uncovered the fraud .
He was fired in August last year .
The Serious Fraud Office laid three charges just before Christmas and he pleaded guilty earlier this year .
His lawyer Stuart Grieve , QC , said Versalko had shown " exceptional remorse " and deserved credit for admitting the fraud and helping the SFO track down where all the money went .
For the first time the details of the case , which have been suppressed , were made public .
Mr McCann said Versalko was running a " classic ponzi scheme " - where he promised clients interest and repayments , then stole from new investors to make those repayments , all the while siphoning off money for his life style .
The ASB Bank has already reimbursed all the clients ripped off by Versalko and were in the process of recovering money from Versalko .
ASB takes any matters of fraud very seriously and is pleased that the SFO investigation has culminated in Stephen Versalko being sentenced to imprisonment after pleading guilty to his criminal activity .
In a statement ASB said only a very small number of customers were affected by Versalko ’s offending and all had been reimbursed and apologised again to customers affected .
ASB said as a result of the fraud it had introduced additional processes and practices to further strengthen security and protect customers .
Versalko's fraud contributed to driving the ASB Bank to its first loss in 20 years in its accounts for the first half of the current financial year .
Sean Flynn could have done anything he wanted .
For a while he tried to be an actor like his swashbuckling father , Errol .
But the passion that drove him was to work as a photographer covering America 's deadly wars in Indochina .
The dangerous , chaotic assignment brought him excitement and fame , but it also led him to his death .
Forty years ago next week , Flynn and another journalist , Dana Stone , disappeared without trace after encountering a hostile checkpoint south - east of Phnom Penh .
Now , forensic tests are to be performed on remains that have been dug up in rural Cambodia by two amateur " bone hunters " who claim they have finally answered the mystery as to what happened to the two men , among three dozen journalists to have lost their lives during the war in Cambodia .
John Johnson , a spokesman for the US embassy in Phnom Penh , said the remains had been sent to the Pentagon 's Joint POW / MIA Accounting Command ( JPAC ) located in Hawaii where the tests will be conducted .
" Last Friday , the possible remains were delivered to us and we have taken action , " he said .
" It is hard to speculate how long the tests will take .
All these cases are individual . "
Yet the possible discovery of the remains of Flynn , who was aged 28 when he disappeared , has sparked controversy .
Not only are the two men who made the find seeking to sell their story to the highest bidder , but a former colleague of the journalists believes the excavation of the burial site was conducted unprofessionally and may have disturbed a larger grave in which the remains of other journalists may lie .
The remains handed over to the US authorities in Cambodia were found by Briton Keith Rotheram and Scottish - born Australian David MacMillan more than two weeks ago .
Reports say they were alerted to the location in Kampong Cham province in eastern Cambodia by a local man who claimed to have been a witness to the execution of a tall , blond foreigner .
The witness claimed the foreigner had been forced to dig his own grave before he was battered to death .
The two men hired bomb disposal experts , a bulldozer and teams of local people to excavate the site in the village of Phka Dong , where they uncovered clothes , bone fragments and teeth .
Contacted yesterday by The Independent , Mr Rotheram , who runs a guesthouse in the town of Sihanoukville , refused to answer any questions about the discovery , the full story of which , he said , would " be for the highest bidder " .
Mr MacMillan claimed elsewhere that the four - month search had been partly funded by Flynn 's half - sister .
Yet the excavation of the site has been criticised by a colleague of the journalists who has led the search for them almost ever since they went missing .
Tim Page , a British photographer celebrated for his work in Vietnam and other conflicts , said he believed a number of other foreign journalists may have been executed and buried at the same site .
Mr Page , 64 , who is featured in Michael Herr 's classic memoir of the Vietnam war , Dispatches , said he had led an excavation of the same site last year and found glass vials , bone fragments and teeth that he had handed to JPAC , along with GPS co-ordinates .
He said it was vital a thorough examination of the site be conducted as local people claimed it held the remains of more than one foreigner killed by the Khmer Rouge .
" I have had hundreds of people contact me over the years about Sean and I 'm always interested in what they have to say , " Mr Page , who now lives in Brisbane , told The Australian .
" But there is a very strict procedure to be followed when digging at a site of possible human remains , and in this case that has not been followed ...
It was not a forensic dig .
They used an excavator and uncovered a full set of remains , which they removed from the site . "
Sean Flynn was the child of the famed leading man and his first wife , Lili Damita , a French actress who spent huge sums of money to search for her son after he disappeared .
Eventually , the photojournalist was declared officially dead in 1984 , more than a dozen years after he was seized at a checkpoint and handed over to Khmer Rouge rebels .
His mother died in 1994 .
The 1970 - 75 conflict in Cambodia , a spillover of America 's war against the North Vietnamese , pitched the US - backed government headed by Lon Nol against Khmer Rouge insurgents supported by the government in Hanoi .
The war was eventually won by the Maoist - influenced Khmer Rouge forces , which then put in place a murderous four - year regime that caused the death of up to 2 million people .
Flynn and Stone went missing on 6 April 1970 , the former on assignment for Time magazine and his colleague for CBS News .
The two men were part of a larger group of journalists who had driven out of Phnom Penh on Highway One , heading toward the Vietnamese city then called Saigon , for a press conference organised by the government .
One of the last Westerners to see the men was Stephen Bell , a reporter with ABC News , who would later go on to anchor Good Morning America .
Speaking last night from Indiana , Mr Bell , who is now retired , said most of the reporters had travelled in large limousines , previously used by tourists but later taken over by the press corps .
However , Flynn and Stone had been travelling by themselves on motorcycles .
東大教官が選んだ新入生向けのブックリストとして、新書「東大教官が新入生すすめる本」と、紀伊國屋書店のサイト[参照]がある。全部で1600冊程と膨大なので、まとめた。まとめるだけでは面白くないので、100冊に絞ってランキングした。
■東大教官の観 点
以下の3つの観点から選書している。
1 ) 私の読書から――印象に残っている本
2 ) これだけは読んでおこう――研究者の立場から
3 ) 私がすすめる東京大学出版会の 本
1 ) は、読書経験の貧富がハッキリ見える。めったな本を勧めるわけにはいかない。ほとんどが厳めしい古典、大御所を占める。ところが、ウケ狙いか、小松左京や村上龍、コミック「棒がいっぽん」などを推す教官がいて面白い。
2 ) の意味を拡大解釈する教官多し。何十巻もある「○○全集」を指定してくる人もいる。ゼミ生になったら生き字引代わりにでもしようとするつもりかしらん。オマエも全読してねぇだろ！と無音でツッコむ。
3 ) は東大出版会の宣伝とみなしている。「教科書」なんだし、胴元だから許されるんだね。ただし、東大出版会も" The Universe of English " や「知の技法」など、良本を出してることも心に留めてご紹介する。

では、東大教官がすすめる本ベスト100のご紹介～
■ 第1位～第10 位
1. カラマーゾフの兄弟（フョードル・ミハイロヴィチ・ドストエフスキー）
2. 量子力学（レフ・ダヴィドヴィッチ・ランダウ）
3. 線型代数入門（斎藤正彦）

8. 邪宗門（高橋和巳）
9. 物と心（大森荘蔵）
10 . ゲーデル、エッシャー、バッハ（ダグラス・Ｒ．ホフスタッター）
「 カラ兄 」 堂堂1位なりイイィィィ さすが最強の小説！
教科書（東大出版）が混じるが、サイード「オリエンタリズム」とヴェーバー「プロ倫」と大御所を推すところはサスガ学問の最高府ですな。「邪宗門」が入っているのは団塊エリート世代の教科書だからだろう。
【 第1位】カラマーゾフの兄弟（ドストエフスキー ）
流石というかヤッパリというか、「カラ兄」がイチバン東大新入生にオススメされている小説。ハイ、もちろん一冊だけ選べというならば、わたしも「最高の小説」と強く推す。50回読むとウィトゲンシュタインになれるというのはウソかもしれないが、ウィトゲンシュタインは50回精読したのは本当らしい。特に「大審問官」はスゴい。生を生きなおすようなす経験を請けあおう。この blog で 「すごい本」を探している方へ→スゴい本は沢山あるけれど、頂点はこれ。徹夜小説、劇薬小説、夢中小説、最高小説、キング・オブ・スゴ本、あらゆる称号のトップはダントツこれ。未読の方は四の五の言わずに読め（命令形）。最強の読書体験を約束する。ただし、非常に強い酒のような小説なので読んでクラクラしないよう気をつけて。
【 第4 位 】The Universe of English（第2版）（東京大学教養学部英語部会）
Z会の教材で何篇か読んだ記憶が。駒場連中の「教科書」だから東大生なら見たくもないかもしれないケド、知的好奇心をソソられるネタもあるはず。パトリック・マグラアの「 O'Malley and Schwartz」なんて持ってくるのはセンスいい（露悪?）と思うゾ。2006年から第3版を使うらしい。
【 第5位】オリエンタリズム（エドワード・サイード）
大学時代にムリヤリ読まされた記憶が。歴史 ＝ 自らを正当化するためのラベリングの歴史 だと納得させられた 。Wikipedia の紹介が分かりよい → 「 オリエンタル（東洋、東洋的、東洋性）は、西洋によって作られたイメージであり、文学、歴史学、人類学等、広範な文化活動の中に見られる。それはしばしば優越感や傲慢さ、偏見とも結びついているばかりではなく、サイードによれば西洋の帝国主義の基盤ともなったとされる」…イヤイヤ読んだので良い思い出はないので、今度は自分の知的好奇心のために再読しよう。
【第6位】プロテスタンティズムの倫理と資本主義の精神（マックス・ヴェーバー）
これも有名どころですな。一文でまとめると「営利の追求を敵視するピューリタニズムの経済倫理が実は近代資本主義の生誕に大きく貢献したのだという歴史の逆説を究明した画期的な論考」とのこと（amazon紹介）。「プロ倫」の解説はさんざ読まされているので「読んだ気分」になってるが、未読だったりする。
【 第8位】邪宗門（高橋和巳）
戦後世代に衝撃をあたえた（らしい）作品。ありうべき世を求めて権力と相対峙した新興宗教団体の誕生から壊滅に至るまでの歴史を描いた壮大な叙事詩とのこと。実はコレ、高校時代に親にシツコク勧められた作品なのだが、未だ読んでない（←親不孝モノ）。ごめんよ。
【 第10位】ゲーデル、エッシャー、バッハ（ダグラス・ホフスタッター）
オススメ本について、結城浩さんに質問をする機会があって、結城さんの回答が「これまでにもっとも繰り返し読んだ本は『ゲーデル・エッシャー・バッハ』」とのこと[参照]。以来、図書館から借り出しては→挫折の繰り返し…レベル高ッ。reflexive（再帰）を論理と音楽とイメージの3点から攻めていることは分かるけれど、読んでいるというよりも、字面を「見て」いるだけでちっともアタマに沁みこんでこない。ひそかに購入を決心している一冊でもある（いかんせん大著なのだ、ボリュームもお値段も！）。

文系理系ごちゃまぜなのが良いカンジ。「文系だから 」
「理系なのに」は枕詞としてよく使われるが、枕詞並に意味が無い。例えばホーキングやグールドは「理系」、丸山真男やヴェーバーは「文系」の本とされるが、読み手はそれを意識して手にするか?
否とよ。面白けりゃ読むだろうし、使えなけりゃ見向きもしないだけ。知的好奇心を自分で矯めてどうする。
認知論の本（ 「 理解と何か 」 「 知るということ 」 「認知とパフォーマンス」など）が多くあるが、東大出版会のいわゆる「教科書」。教科書として読むと苦痛だけど、ハマってみたかった分野。tagを貼っておきたいナリ。
【 第12位】ホーキング、宇宙を語る（スティーヴン・ホーキング）
ニュートン物理学→相対性理論までが前半で、後半が量子力学と相対論の統一を通した究極の説明：「なぜ宇宙が生まれ、現代のような形になったのか」。ええ、もちろんミーハーなので出た当時に読んだぞ→さっぱり理解できなかったケド。ただし、功利的な観点からニュートンを評するあたりで科学というものは一つの神話に過ぎないという事実を思い知らされたことはハッキリ覚えている。「説明」ができる間だけ信じられるのが「科学」であり、説明抜きに信じてもらえるのが宗教だったりする。続編はそのうち読むかも「ホーキング、宇宙のすべてを語る」。
【 第32位】理科系の作文技術（木下是雄）
「 理科系の」と銘打っているが、文理関係なかろう。調査報告、技術報告、計画申請書など、学生・社会人に関係なく、書かなければならないドキュメントは多い。書く際に最初に考えなければならないことが二つある
→「これを読むのは誰で、その人に何を伝えるのか」なり。その上で主題を決め、結論を決め、そいつを支える構成・展開・データを考える。目標を定めた書き方が身につく（とのこと）。実は未読なのだが、この紹介文書いてるうちに読みたくなってきたナリ。100位には入ってないが、「理系の女の生き方ガイド」は何やら痛そうで面白そう（未読）。

ロジカルシンキングが専門語を一切使わず噛んで含めるように書いてある。読むだけで腑に落ちるスゴ本。レビューは[ここ]。これをゼミで実践している学生さんがうらやましすぎるぞ。社会人になって高額のトレーニングを受けたり、実践で時間をかけて培ったりする" エッセンス"をゼミで身に付けられるのだから。このリストも同様のことが言えるが、東大は勉強するには良い環境だとつくづく思う。
【 第69位】方法序説（デカルト）
恥ずかしながら未読。部分の和が全体（となるような分解）や、原因と結果の法則について書いてあるんだなーということは薄々知ってはいたけど…小林秀雄「考えるヒント2」の「常識について」によると、「方法序説」なんてお題が堅物らしい。むしろ「方法の話」とでも訳したほうがよいとのこと。何の方法かというと、生きてゆくうえで真実を見つけ出し、判断する方法。デカルトが、当時の学問語であるラテン語を捨てて、平易なフランス語で、しかも匿名で書いたそうな。大切なことは、見つけ出した「真実」や「判断」そのものではなく、そこへ至った方法だという。これは学問の多寡に関係しないし、誰にでもどんなことにでも応用が可能だから。正しく認識するための「原理」や、有効に行動するための「格率」が立てられる。身につけたら一生モノだな。

第75位からは2票ばかりなので、わたしの独断で選本。既読のものは印象深いオススメ本だし、未読のものは強烈に読みたい本ばかり。
【 第77位】ご冗談でしょう、ファインマンさん（リチャード・ファインマン）
「 傑作だ→読め」と勧められているが、未読。「ファインマン」と聞けば、もちろん、量子力学でもマンハッタン計画でもノーベル賞でもなく、茶目っ気たっぷりの風貌と共に本書を思い浮かべるが、未読。学生のときに読み逃しておくとずっと（微かに）後悔するハメになる。読んでる人は東大教官が勧めなくても手に取っているハズだが…
【 第78 位 】 「 トムは真夜中の庭で 」
ネットで知って、もう何年も前から気になっている小説。正確にはわたしの知らないスゴい本を読んでる複数の人が絶賛する本。ネタバレしないように関連情報には極力目を伏せている。良い機会だ、ここで挙げたのをきっかけに読んでみよう（ただし、わたしの読むリストはFIFOなので、" いつか読む" にはかわりない）
【 第79位】はてしない物語と【第81位】モモ（ミヒャエル・エンデ）
こいつを大学新入生にオススメする教官も面白い。良い本は2種類ある。一つは、賢くする（あるいは賢くなった気分にする）本。もう一つは豊かにする（あるいは豊かになった気分になる）本。これは後者。しかも気分ではなく本当に豊かになる。どちらもとてもオモシロイので強力にオススメ。そして、ただオモシロイ面白いと興ずるうちに、なんだか薄ら寒い思いで後ろを振り返るはず。だから「小学校高学年から」なんて児童書扱いされてると激しく違うと言いたくなる。これは「オトナ向け」。余談だが、本書のリンクを作る際に知ったのだが、「はてしない物語」は文庫化されているではないかッ！しかも二分冊でッ！！これでは「いま、読み手が手にしている本」と「本の中の主人公が読んでる本」とのシンクロが楽しめないではないかバカモーン！
【 第82位】完全な真空（スタニスワフ・レム）
本書は、実在しない本について書かれた架空の書評集。でも実体は手元にあるじゃないか、と読むと非常に奇妙な感覚に囚われることを請合う。本書でレビューされる「架空の本」「架空の講演 」「架空の論文」の一つひとつがまたよく出来てて思わず知らずつりこまれる。非常に実験的な「作品」が多々あり、「とどのつまりは何も無し」と「我は僕（しもべ）ならずや」あたりを読んだときの妙な気持ちは、今でも強く覚えている。書評という形でしか存在しえない「本」ということが面白い。ただ、そんな実在しない本のレビューに没頭しているわたしは誰だ?
さらにそいつをオススメするわたしは?
などと一度ならずとも思うはず。
【 第84位】君たちはどう生きるか（吉野源三郎）
コペル君の話。何度も手にするクセに読みきれていないので、未読。人生をいかに生くべきかというテーマをティーン向けに説く。いつかわが子に渡すために、今わたしが読んでおかないとなぁ…
本書は広島大学総合科学部「大学新入生に薦める101冊」でも強力にオススメされているぞ。
【 第90位】星の王子さま（アントアーヌ・ド・サン・テグジュペリ）
これは 「たいせつな人」へオススメする本なりィッ
新入生に軽々しく「読め」などと言えぬ…それぐらい思い入れがある（だろ?
あなたも）。名台詞「たいせつなものは目に見えない」の破壊力は、そうだな…「もうゴールしてもいいよね?」級と言っておこう。この本をオススメしたい人が沢山いる、という人生が豊かなんだろうなー、などと思ったり。
【 第92位】大聖堂（ケン・フォレット）
大聖堂 ｷﾀ━━━ ━ ( ﾟ∀ﾟ ) ━━━━ｯ!!
こいつはスゴいぞ楽しいぞ、その名も超電磁ロボ…じゃなくて「大聖堂」は面白い小説の見本のようなもの。最近読んだ100冊本の中でおもしろさNo.1（たぶん）。中世ヨーロッパが舞台なのだが、時代を超えて人間の欲望が生み出す壮大なドラマと「大聖堂」を見上げることができる。欲望は様々な形を取る。権力欲、支配欲、愛欲、性欲、意欲、我欲、禁欲、強欲、財欲、色欲、食欲、邪欲、情欲、大欲、知識欲、貪欲、肉欲…ありとあらゆる「欲望」を具現化したドラマ。ハラハラドキドキ、ワクワクテカテカしながら読みふけれい。わたしのレビューは[ここ ] 。
【 第93位】誰のためのデザイン？（ドナルド・Ａ．ノーマン）
ありとあらゆ る 「 ユーザーインタフェース」の基底となる本（コンピュータのGUI に限らない）。モノの持つ属性（色や形）が、そのモノ自身をどう取り扱ったら良いかについてのメッセージをユーザに対して発している、いわゆる affordance の根っこが分かる。 「使いやすいとはどういうことか」が肌で分かる。ボタンの配置だとか見出しの色だとか、Webデザインネタが巷に数多にあるけれど、あくまで表層的なもの。もっと根源的な「どうしてそうだと分かるか」についてここまで実例を掘り下げて書いてあるのはめったにない。デザイン本をいくつも漁るよりも、デザイン本とは縁遠いようなコレをしっかりと読み込むほうが近道。ちなみに100位以内に入ってないが、「生きのびるためのデザイン」も推薦されてた。
【 第94位】不滅（ミラン・クンデラ）
クンデラの最高はコレ。けして「存在の耐えられない軽さ」ではない。魂の不滅、存在の不滅を語るため、時空を超えて小説論、文明批判、省察、伝記などを混ぜこぜにしたクンデラの長い長い独り言のような小説。ポリフォニックな小説といえばドストエフスキーだろうが、クンデラのこれも好きー。わたしのレビューは[ここ]（長いゾ）。
【 第95位】棒がいっぽん（高野文子）
「 黄色い本 」で知り 「るきさん」でファンになり、本書は次に読もうと思ってる。なんてことない起伏の少ないマンガなんだけどーーーうーん、なんかこう、毎日の生活の中でクッと背中のツボを押されるような気分にさせられる。手元にあるとつい何度でも読み返してしまう、不思議な魅力を持つ。しかし、コレを新入生に勧める東大教官って…orz
【 第96位】竜馬がゆく（司馬遼太郎）
いろんな意味で思い入れが激しい作品。3回読んだし、また手にするだろう。語り始めると止められなくなるので紹介はするまい。こいつはblogで気を吐くよりも、誰かとリアルで話をしたいですな。この作品を（酒でも入れて）語り合える友がいる人生が、アツい人生なんだろな。未読の方は読め（命令形）、と。読むと「外へ」出たくなる。体がアツくなる、吼えたくなる。若ければ若いほど効果大だゾ。
【 第98位】コインロッカー・ベイビーズ（村上龍）
村上龍のサイコウケッサク。読むとアタマガツンと一撃喰らう。あまりにスゴいので、彼の作品はコレで測ってる。曰く「コインロッカー・ベイビーズ」より面白いか否か」…おかげで彼の作品は一切読んでいない。amazon紹介を引用
→「コインロッカーを胎内としてこの世に生まれ出たキクとハシ。罪の子ふたりの心に渦まく愛と憎悪。廃墟と化した東京の上空に、華やかなステージに、そして南海の暗い海底に強烈な破壊のエネルギーがほとばしる」…うーん、こんなんだったっけ?
再読するか。そして毒に中（あた）るか。
【 第99位】ファウンデーション（アイザク・アシモフ）
長門有希さんご推挙の逸品 … wikipedia によると、一つのゆるやかなシリーズにまとめられる作品群を総称している（らしい）。「 ファウンデーション 」
「 ファウンデーション対帝国 」 「第二ファウンデーション 」 「ファウンデーションの彼方へ 」 「ファウンデーションと地球 」
「ファウンデーションへの序曲 」「ファウンデーションの誕生」とあるとのこと。んで、どれ読みゃいいんだ?
未読だと思っていたが、「鋼鉄都市」は読んだ記憶が…
読書指南役の嫁さんも読んでなさそうだし、ネタバレにならない程度の紹介を探してみよう。
【 第100位】論理トレーニング１０１題（野矢茂樹）
宣伝文句 「 解説書なんかいくら読んだって論理の力は鍛えられない」に引っ張られた一冊。途中で投げ出しているので未読。amazonの宣伝で手にとる気力が湧いてきたぞ
→「ひとり本書に向かって言葉と格闘し、煩悶（はんもん）し、その筋道をたどる作業が論理の力を鍛えてくれるはずだからだ。『頭の回転が速い』とか『知性的』というのは、こうした地道なトレーニングの積み重ねに負うところが大きいのだろう。通勤、通学時の1冊としてもおすすめ」…読もっと。未読本の紹介をしているうちに読みたくなるのは不思議だねー

未読既読をチェックするのもいいし、年ごとのオススメ傾向の推移を眺めても楽しいかも。東京大学出版会だけ抜けば教科書以外のオススメリストができあがる。「ソレを推すなら、コレ読んでるのかぁ」なんて意地悪になると大穴本に出会えるかも。「教官」ではなく、「教授」が選んだブックリストであれば、「教養のためのブックガイド」がオススメ。「教養とは」から真っ向勝負して、「教養の罠」を上手く回避した、良いガイドだと思う。そのうちレビューするのでお楽しみに。
東大ブランドをありがたがるつもりは毛頭ないが、このオススメ本のリストといい、ロジカルシンキングのゼミ[参照]といい、やっぱ違う。他の100冊リストと比べてみると面白いかも。
