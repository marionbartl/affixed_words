When I came across the above photo I was blown away : I ’ve seen Metropolis and looked at so many stills — yet I never came across a image that represented so well the amazing amount of work that went into this film .
So I set on a quest to locate other behind - the - scenes glimpses of the work that Fritz Lang did before he fled Germany in 1933 :
This photo shows Fritz Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou in their Berlin apartment , 1923 or 1924 .
The two worked together a great deal during the 20s and wrote the script for Metropolis together .
However they separated in 1931 and divorced in 1933 as Hitler came to power .
Thea joined the Nazi party and continued writing scripts during the war — however Lang ’s mother was Jewish and thus he was lucky enough to flee Germany .
This amazing photo shows Lang on the set of the flooded city of Metropolis .
Actress Brigitte Helm played Maria and the robot in Metropolis — like Lang she left Germany in 1935 and moved to Switzerland where she lived until the age of 88 in 1996 .
She retired from filmmaking but left behind an amazing legacy from the silent film era .
This is an Architectural drawing of Metropolis by the artist Erich Kettelhut ( 1893-1979 ) .
Kettelhut got his start as a stage - set painter and worked on quite a few of the expressionist silent films of the 20s including earlier collaborations with Lang on Dr. Mabuse der Spieler ( 1921 ) and Die Nibelungen ( 1924 ) .
This drawing by Kettelhut was actually used as part of the opening sequence of Metropolis .
It was created with a combination of dawring , oil pant and gouache on cardboard .
This was a preproduction sketch by Kettelhut which showed the city of Metropolis — this was the second sketch he did and you can see how he slowly evolved from a cityscape that looked like a Manhattan skyline to something had more of a science fiction flavor .
And here are carpenters at work making those preproduction drawings come to life .
If you look at the center of the drawing you can see the left side of the central building of Metropolis which would inspire the film Blade Runner over fifty years later .
Frau Im Mond ( Woman in the Moon ) from 1929 was years ahead of its time in showing a journey to the moon .
This photo shows them filming on the set of the moon which features a giant backdrop painting of a lunar landscape .
This is the model of the rocket used in Frau Im Mond which shows the amazing amount of detail that Lang would put into his films .
In fact the rocket scientist Hermann Oberth was a technical advisor to Lang on the film which became very popular with Wernher von Braun ’s circle .
After World War II Oberth went to work for Wernher von Braun doing work for NASA and while he retired in 1962 he did witness the first moon launch of the Apollo 11 .
This photo shows the master at work — on the far left is Fritz Lang instructing the cameraman on the set of Frau Im Mond .
When Lang moved to America he did a great deal of work in Hollywood including many films that were westerns and film noir , but sadly he never returned to making science fiction films .

Having seen Coyne 's appropriately trippy poop cave , it 's got me wondering if other musicians ' homes reflect their sensibilities as closely .
Is John Mayer 's house ordinary and forgettable on the outside but chaotically and impenetrably decorated on the inside ?
Does Prince 's Minneapolis home have a bunch of sex swings ?
Yes , yes , I 'm sure it does .

When it comes to full - text indexing , we usually think of methods such as inverted indices that break text on word boundaries , consequently requiring search terms to be whole words only .
Yet all of us probably have had the experience of searching for not - quite - words 
C++ , VM / CMS , SQL * Plus , 127.0.0.1 , < blink > , and the like  that were skipped by an inverted index , or broken into less - distinctive pieces .
The same goes when you are working with data such as DNA sequences , where you need to quickly find any sequence of symbols .
In this article , I examine an indexing method that lets you find any character sequence in the source text  in time only proportional to the sequence length  using a structure that can compress the entire source text and index into less space than the text alone .
This technique is exceptionally fast at detecting and counting occurrences of any string in the source text .
The fact that you can build a string match incrementally adding one character at a time and seeing the result at each stepgives you the flexibility to explore variable patterns such as regular expressions with maximum effectiveness .
Finding any character sequence in source text and fast !
In Fast String Searching with Suffix Trees ( DDJ , August 1996 ) , Mark Nelson addressed full - text indexing using suffix trees ; while in Data Compression with the Burrows - Wheeler Transform ( DDJ , September 1996 ) , he focused on the use of the Burrows - Wheeler Transform ( BWT ) for compression .
While the BWT is commonly known as a data - compression technique , researchers have found that block - sorted data has a structure that lends itself naturally to search , while using space close to its minimal compressed size .
This was first demonstrated in the FM index ( see Opportunistic Data Structures with Applications , by Paolo Ferragina and Giovanni Manzini , Proceedings of the 41st IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science , 2000 ) .
In short , the same transformation that yields high - compression ratios , by grouping similar substrings together , also lets you find arbitrary substrings with little overhead .
Block Sorting Reviewed
When block sorting , you construct a list of n blocks consisting of the source text S ( usually followed by a special End - of - String character $ ) of length n , cyclically shifted from zero to n-1 positions .
When you sort the blocks , you get a matrix M ; see Figure 1 ( a ) .
The first column of M is called F , and the last , L. F has a simple structure , containing all the characters of S in sorted order , with duplicates .
Column L has a more complex structure that contains enough information to reconstruct the original string , and usually forms the basis for BWT compression .
Figure 1 ( a ) : Block - sorted text .
Start with the source string " abracadabra . "
Append an end - of - file metacharacter $ , with the property that $ < a - z .
Cyclically shift the string from 0 to n- 1 places , and sort the resulting list .
Each row is called a " block , " containing original text left - shifted 0 to n- 1 places .
M is the 12×12 block - sorted matrix for string " abracadabra$ , " F is the first column of the matrix , L is the last column .
In its naive form , M contains n2 characters , but a simple trick represents each block by its first character and a link to the block starting one character to the right ; Figures 1 ( b ) and 1 ( c ) .
To decode a block , you read its first character , follow its link to the next block , read its character and link , and repeat the process until the desired number of characters have been read .
This character - and - link representation slashes spatial complexity from O ( n2 ) to O( n ) .
Figure 1 ( b ) : Replacing abracadra$ with " a " and a pointer to bracadabra$a .
Figure 1 ( c ) : Twelve blocks replaced with F column and 12 pointers to suffixes .
The links act as a permutation on M , which I call FL because it permutes the orderly F column to the higher entropy L column .
FL is the permutation caused by shifting M one column to the left and resorting it ; each row i moves to a new position FL [ i ] .
Since the F column is a sorted list of characters , the next space saver is to change from explicitly storing the F column , to simply recording the starting position for each character 's range in F , using an array that I call " C " ; Figure 1 ( c ) .
At a given position i in M , you look through C to find the section c of F that contains i.
The F ( ) method in bwtindex.cc applies this idea .
Also see Figure 1 ( d ) .
Figure 1( d ) : Discard F column and use C to identify characters .
By storing only FL and C , you have a reasonable  but not minimal representation of M , and you can decode successive characters of the source from left to right .
The decode method in bwtindex.cc shows how to carry out this iteration .
See Figure 1(e ) .
Figure 1(e ) : Decoding from any position .
Chase pointers and translate each position to char using C .
The decode method shows this technique in bwtindex.cc .
Useful Properties of the Permutation
Figure 2 shows how FL is order preserving on blocks that start with the same character .
That is , given two blocks i and j that both start with c , lexical comparison implies that if i<j , then FL [ i ] < FL[j ] .
This is one of the core elements of the BWT .
Figure 2 : This map is called FL because it rearranges the F column into the L column .
FL is order - preserving for strings that start with the same character , so each character 's section in FL contains an ascending list of integers .
Here , you see the " fan-out " for blocks prefixed by " a . "
This order - preserving property means that FL consists of sections of integers in ascending order , one section for each character .
You can search one of these sections for a target value quickly , using binary search .

Now , terrorist masterminds have devised a new hiding place : Breast implants .
Female Al Qaeda suicide bombers are being surgically fitted with explosive enhancements , according to intelligence sources .
Such implants would only be detectable by X - ray machines , and not airport scanners .
How seriously should America take this new threat ?
The TSA is already thinking about it :
The " tatas of terror " sounds like a joke , says Vicki Crawford in the Naples News .
But it 's deadly serious .
How to deal with it though ?
One imagines " different scanners for the endowed " and even " visual checks " for surgical scars .
Male TSA employees hoping to become " inspectors " in the new regime will be disappointed though — " sorry boys , " that 's a woman 's job .
" Goombas of death "
A good argument against body scanners :
There 's no " ironclad system " to protect against this , says Elan Singer in Forbes , unless we 're willing to " travel naked . "
What this proves is that Al Qaeda can always find a way past security precedures .
These " high tech " body scanners , bought for around " $ 150,000 a pop " will produce nothing except " longer security lines " — we should give up on them now .
" Next up : The boob bomber "
Only profiling will work :
This " takes terrorism onto a whole new level , " says Jeff Taylor at Economic Voice .
But we should n't go down the " intrusive " and " time consuming " route of banning hand luggage and introducing mandatory " full body searches . "
Far better to " get off the PC bandwagon " and " start overt profiling . "
By " using all the tools in the box , " we can defend ourselves .
" Surgically implanted bombs , what next ? "

St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital and Washington University team to unravel genetic basis of childhood cancers
Largest research project to date aimed at understanding the genetic origins of pediatric cancers
St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis , today announced an unprecedented effort to identify the genetic changes that give rise to some of the world 's deadliest childhood cancers .
The team has joined forces to decode the genomes of more than 600 childhood cancer patients who have contributed tumor samples for this historic effort .
The St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital – Washington University Pediatric Cancer Genome Project is the largest investment to date — estimated to cost $ 65 million over three years — aimed at understanding the genetic origins of childhood cancers .
Scientists involved in the project will sequence the entire genomes of both normal and cancer cells from each patient , comparing differences in the DNA to identify genetic mistakes that lead to cancer .
Kay Jewelers , a long - standing supporter of St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital , has committed to providing $ 20 million as lead sponsor of this project .
" We are on the threshold of a revolution in our understanding of the origins of cancer .
For the first time in history , we have the tools to identify all of the genetic abnormalities that turn a white blood cell into a leukemia cell or a brain cell into a brain tumor , " said Dr. William E. Evans , St. Jude director and chief executive officer .
" We believe it is from this foundation that advances for 21st century cancer diagnosis and treatment will come . "
St. Jude is home to one of the world 's largest and most complete repositories of biological information about childhood cancer .
The collection dates to the 1970s and includes more than 50,000 tumor , bone marrow , blood and other biological samples .
These samples are essential to efforts to understand the origins of cancer .
The tissue bank has also helped St. Jude scientists develop the experimental models expected to be important for determining which mutations drive cancer 's development and spread .
The collaboration focuses on childhood leukemias , brain tumors and tumors of bone , muscle and other connective tissues called sarcomas .
St. Jude will provide DNA from tumor and normal tissues of patients , Washington University 's Genome Center will perform the whole genome sequencing , and both will participate in validation sequencing .
Researchers at both institutions will collaborate to analyze the data and make the information publicly available once validated .
Prior research by this group and others indicates that the many genetic abnormalities in childhood cancers will differ from those found in adult cancers .
" This extraordinary partnership will add a new dimension to our understanding of childhood cancers , " says pediatric geneticist Dr. Larry J. Shapiro , executive vice chancellor and dean of Washington University School of Medicine .
" A genome - wide understanding of cancer offers great promise for developing powerful new approaches to diagnose and treat cancer or perhaps even to prevent it .
In the short term , the project will yield key genetic information that may ultimately help physicians choose the best treatment options for young cancer patients . "
Scientists at Washington University 's Genome Center pioneered whole - genome sequencing of cancer patients ' genomes .
In 2008 , they became the first to decode the complete genome of a cancer patient – a woman with leukemia – and trace her disease to its genetic roots .
They have since sequenced the genomes of additional cancer patients , including those with breast , lung and ovarian tumors and glioblastoma , a type of brain tumor .
These studies have identified intriguing and unexpected genetic connections between patients with different types of cancer that likely would not have been discovered using conventional approaches .
Earlier research to identify cancer mutations has typically focused only on the few hundred genes already suspected of being involved in the disease .
While a few recent studies have involved sequencing the 20,000 or so protein - coding genes in the genome , the whole - genome approach involved in this collaboration provides a more detailed and complete picture of all the mutations involved in a patient 's cancer by examining both the protein - coding genes and the long stretches of DNA between genes , which may influence the ways the genes work .
Such complete genomic sequencing is now possible because of recent advances that have made the technology faster and far less expensive .
Researchers involved in the project also will investigate how pediatric cancer is influenced by variations in the genome , including epigenetic changes , which alter the expression of genes but not the genes themselves .
They also will use DNA sequencing data to identify genetic markers that can help physicians decide the best treatment options for cancer patients , based on the genetic profile of their tumors .
The project 's scope and design reflects the philosophies and talents of the institutions involved .
St. Jude and Washington University have a history of scientific collaboration and a track record of innovation in patient care .
They also share a commitment to excellence and openness in research .
The pediatric genome project will include a public database where information , once validated , will be shared with the international scientific community , with the goal of accelerating progress against childhood cancer .
While great progress has been made in treating childhood cancer , it is still the leading cause of death from disease among U.S. children over one year of age , and cure rates for some childhood cancers remain below 50 percent .
St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital
St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital is internationally recognized for its pioneering research and treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases .
Ranked the No. 1 pediatric cancer hospital by Parents magazine , St. Jude is the first and only NCI - designated Comprehensive Cancer Center devoted solely to children , and has treated children from all 50 states and from around the world .
St. Jude has developed research protocols that helped push overall survival rates for childhood cancer from less than 20 percent when the hospital opened to almost 80 percent today .
St. Jude is the national coordinating center for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium and the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study .
In addition to pediatric cancer research , St. Jude is also a leader in sickle cell disease research and is a globally prominent research center for influenza .
Founded in 1962 by the late entertainer Danny Thomas , St. Jude freely shares its discoveries with scientific and medical communities around the world , publishing more research articles than any other pediatric cancer research center in the United States .
St. Jude treats over 5,400 patients each year , and is the only pediatric cancer research center where families never pay for treatment not covered by insurance .
St. Jude is financially supported by thousands of individual donors , organizations and corporations without which the hospitals ' work would not be possible .

The Toronto Transit Commission would be designated an essential service , its workers prohibited from striking , under private - member 's legislation being introduced Monday by a leading Liberal MPP .
David Caplan ( Don Valley East ) says commuters are fed up with work stoppages that disrupt the city and cost the local economy about $ 50 million a day .
" No strikes , no lockouts .
And it establishes – if the parties can't bargain on their own – an arbitration process for them to resolve their collective - bargaining issues , " he told the Star .
" We 've had too many work stoppages over the course of recent years .
Enough is enough . "
Mayor David Miller and a majority of city councillors oppose Queen 's Park declaring the TTC essential because they believe it would lead to unaffordable arbitrated wage settlements .
" The party line is that these kinds of arbitration processes cost more than collective bargaining .
I do n't buy that , " said Caplan , a former senior minister in Premier Dalton McGuinty 's cabinet .
" Because what happens , as we 've seen the last several rounds , is we have a work stoppage , the province convenes an emergency session to send people back to work and to send it to arbitration , " he said .
Indeed , when transit workers walked off the job at midnight on a Friday in April 2008 , McGuinty called a rare weekend sitting of the Legislature to enact back - to - work legislation .
" If the rules of the game were set out ahead of time , it would give far more motivation for both sides to get to work to settle things ... to keep the transit system and the city running much more effectively , " noted Caplan .
" The phony dance that happens ahead of time – we do n't have to deal with that . "
A 2008 report by the C.D. Howe Institute , an independent think - tank , found that declaring a public service essential increases the cost of negotiated wage settlements without reducing work stoppages .
The report estimated such a measure would cost the cash - strapped TTC an additional $ 23 million over a three - year contract if workers get deals similar to those awarded essential servants such as police officers and firefighters .
While it is relatively uncommon for a private - member 's bill to become law , the influential Caplan , who voluntarily resigned from McGuinty 's cabinet in October to help the Liberals weather the eHealth Ontario spending scandal , is no ordinary backbencher .
Widely expected to be returning to the premier 's executive council before the October 2011 provincial election , the former health minister is a well - regarded MPP who championed city of Toronto issues at the cabinet table .
Caplan is also mindful Torontonians expect the Better Way to actually be better , so such legislation would be smart politics in a city where Liberals hold 18 of 22 seats .
The transit authority has been plagued by service problems and embarrassed by photos of a snoozing ticket - taker and thoughtless bus drivers that went viral on the Internet , as well as the sex - lies - and - text - messages scandal that cost TTC chair Adam Giambrone his Toronto mayoral bid .
But at the end of the day , Torontonians just want buses , trains and streetcars to be there when they need them , emphasized Caplan .
" Residents in Toronto have learned pretty clearly that public transit – whether you 're a transit user or you take your car – is so vital to the health ... and economic well - being of our city , " the MPP said .
" Without it , we grind to a halt .
There 's a tremendous economic cost , but there 's also a tremendous social cost .
It 's clear that it is an essential service and it ought to be declared one , " he said .
" You 're a senior who has to get to a doctor 's appointment , you 're a parent who has to get your kids to school , you 're somebody who has to get to work .
The entire city becomes completely congested and you can't move around . "
While aimed at the TTC , the legislation would also empower the government to similarly designate any other transit system in Ontario .
In the past , McGuinty has indicated a willingness to prohibit TTC workers ' right to strike .
" It 's not fair for 1.5 million commuters to ( be told ) they can't use the system on Monday morning , " the premier said on April 18 , 2008 , days before the most recent strike .

" If there was some kind of an approach made within the course of the next three years by the city of Toronto ... saying we have decided ourselves that it would be a good thing for us to have our public transit system essential , that is something that we , at Queen 's Park , would have to consider , " he said .
Since 1974 , the TTC has been plagued by nine strikes and work - to - rule campaigns , including an illegal one - day walkout in 2006 , a two - day strike in 1999 and an eight - day job action in 1991 .
The C.D. Howe report , however , noted banning strikes does n't prevent illegal walkouts , such as the New York City transit strike of 2005 .
( The union was later fined $ 2.5 million . )
In Montreal , where transit workers are allowed to walk out but must maintain minimum rush - hour and weekend services , transit strikes have twice been ended by legislation since that requirement was added in 1982 .

With a number of injured forwards nearing a return to health , the Detroit Red Wings were left with too many quality players and not enough space to play them .
To ease the backlog , the Wings on Saturday traded left wing Ville Leino to the Philadelphia Flyers for defenseman Ole - Kristian Tollefsen and a fifth - round pick in the 2011 Entry Draft .
The Wings signed the undrafted Leino in the summer of 2007 following a stellar career in the Finnish Elite League .
In 2007 - 08 he had 28 goals and 77 points in 59 games with Jokerit , and was named league MVP .
He spent most of last season with the Wings ’ AHL team , the Grand Rapids Griffins , where he scored 46 points in 57 games , good for fifth on the team .
He then led the club in scoring in the playoffs with 13 points in 10 games .
In 13 NHL games , he had 5 goals and 9 points , and he had 2 assists in seven playoff games .
This season , though , he was n’t producing at the same rate , with just 4 goals and 7 points in 42 games , and he had been a healthy scratch the last six games .
To get him to the AHL , the Wings would have needed to put him through waivers and chance losing him for nothing .
Instead , they dealt him to the Flyers for Tollefsen , who had become expendable with the recent signing of Lukas Krajicek .
Tollefsen has fought a number of injuries this season , including a concussion and sprained knee , and has just 2 assists in 18 games .
He also was selected to play for his native Norway at the 2010 Winter Olympics .
The Wings immediately placed Tollefsen on waivers , and if he clears , he 'll be sent to Grand Rapids .
" Ville is a skilled forward that is going to give us some depth , " Flyers general manager Paul Holmgren said .
" I think he has the ability to play up and down our lineup and play with our skilled players .
We 're excited to have him .
" Leino joined the team in Minnesota on Friday , but did n't play .
He could be in the lineup Monday when the Flyers open a home - and - home set with the New Jersey Devils " Sometimes things do n't go as you plan it with your team , " Leino told the Flyers ' Web site .
" The trade happened , and I am happy to be going to a good team like Philadelphia .
I have heard a lot of good things about Philly and I am looking forward to playing and proving myself to Philadelphia .
I am pretty happy about this trade .
" I consider myself a skilled player .
My talent is more on the offensive side of the rink , but I would like to consider myself as a contributor in the defensive zone , too .
I am hoping to produce some offense and help the team get some points and win games . "
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Legalizing gay marriage would provide a financial boost for San Francisco , the city ’s top economist said on Thursday in a closely watched federal trial over California ’s same - sex marriage ban .

Edmund Egan , the city ’s chief economist , estimated that annual wedding - related spending would rise by $ 35 million in San Francisco , with an additional $ 2.7 million in hotel spending , if same - sex marriage were legal .
That would mean more than $ 2.5 million in additional city taxes , he calculated .
The city would see much more in long - term effects that were difficult to quantify , he added .
“ San Francisco would see an increase in sales tax revenue and an increase in property tax revenue in the future , ” Egan added .
“ Married individuals tend to accumulate more wealth than single people . ”
In November 2008 California voters passed Proposition 8 , a state constitutional amendment limiting marriage to a man and a woman .
The ban came just months after the state Supreme Court had legalized same - sex marriage .
The federal case , which could produce a landmark ruling and lead to an overturning of similar bans in other states , began in San Francisco this month before U.S. District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker .
Supporters of the ban challenged Egan ’s financial estimates , arguing that a boom in weddings -- such as the one San Francisco experienced in the summer of 2008 when gay marriage briefly was made legal -- was unsustainable .
Egan also testified that married people pay lower federal taxes on average , freeing up money to spend in their home city , and they lead healthier lives .
Moreover , legalizing same - sex marriage would cut the city ’s cost of taking on discrimination cases , he said .
The federal challenge , focused on the idea that marriage is a constitutional right , could take years if it winds its way to the U.S. Supreme Court .
DOLLARS AND RIGHTS
The financial side of marriage came out in the civil rights case as San Francisco rebutted the Prop 8 proponents ’ case that a government benefits from restricting marriage to a man and a woman .
“ What we ’re saying is there is not a governmental interest .
In fact there is a governmental harm ” to a ban on same - sex marriage , said Chief Deputy City Attorney Therese Stewart .
Egan calculated that the average couple would save $ 440 per year in federal taxes by being married , and that marriage would cut the ranks of the uninsured as new spouses qualified for benefits under their husbands ’ and wives ’ plans .
Federal law bars spouses of same - sex partners from receiving federal marriage benefits , even in states that recognize their marriage .
That is a major bone of contention for gay rights activists who want President Barack Obama to spearhead a move to change that aspect of the federal “ Defense of Marriage ” law -- or repeal the entire law .
EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. -- Defensive coordinator Bill Sheridan became the first victim of the New York Giants ' collapse in 2009 .
Coach Tom Coughlin dismissed the rookie coordinator late Monday afternoon , just hours after saying that Sheridan 's future with the team was going to be evaluated in the wake of an 8 - 8 season that ended with losses in eight of the final 11 games .
The firing also came the same day that co-owner John Mara vowed to make changes after seeing the season end with two embarrassing losses in which the Giants were outscored 85 - 16 .
The defense struggled this season , giving up 427 points , ranking it third from the bottom in the NFL .
Only the Detroit Lions and St. Louis Rams gave up more points .
Opponents scored at least 40 points in five games , the first time that has happened to the Giants since 1966 .
Neither Sheridan nor Coughlin was immediately available for comment , but Sheridan said last week that he expected to return , noting he felt he did a competent job in a year where the defense was hurt by injuries to middle linebacker Antonio Pierce , safety Kenny Phillips and cornerbacks Corey Webster and Aaron Ross .
" I am disappointed in everybody , in everything , " Mara said less than 24 hours after a season - ending 44 - 7 loss in Minnesota .
" I am unhappy with everyone .
It 's just not acceptable to perform like that .
There are 8 - 8 seasons and there are 8 - 8 seasons , but this one felt like more like 2 - 14 to me . "
In his nearly two decades as part of the Giants hierarchy , Mara said he has never felt like this after a season , especially after the team started 5 - 0 .
" Probably as disappointed as I have been in my life at this team , given the expectations that we had this year , given the roster that we thought we had , given the way we started out and given the embarrassment of the last two weeks . "
Defensive end Justin Tuck said earlier Monday that changing coordinators would mean that the defense will have to get used to another person and possibly another system .
" Obviously , everybody is held to a higher standard , especially here , " Tuck said .
" We expect to be in the running for a championship every year .
When that does n't happen , you 've got to look at yourself and look at the people around you .
I am speaking as far as staff .
You make a decision for whatever it may be , we will deal with it when the time comes . "
Sheridan was elevated from linebackers coach to defensive coordinator after Steve Spagnuolo became the Rams ' coach .
Spagnuolo was the architect of the defense that led the Giants to victory in Super Bowl XLII over the previously unbeaten New England Patriots in February 2008 .

Plot
After uncovering the secrets of the Vault and the sudden death of Commandant Steele , The Crimson Lance led by General Knoxx launch a massive battalion to Pandora and control most of the Parched Fathoms , a region that once had massive oceans that dried up due to Pandora 's sudden climate change and abandoned aged highways littering the area .
The Vault Hunters travel to T - Bone Junction , an old highway rest stop , to stop whatever the Crimson Lance is planning .
With the help from Scooter , they build a new vehicle called the Monster to use on the long highways .
Scooter tells the Vault Hunters that the Lance has set up roadblocks on both the north and southbound highways leading out of T - Bone Junction .
They must reach Moxxi who is in the Deep Fathoms and they must first clear the roadblock in the Crimson Tollway to reach her .
Finding her place on the top of a ruined highway , She shares her plans of another vehicle called the Racer , an upgraded faster version of the Runner that will help them through the roadblock on the Ridgeway , a large highway constructed through an open canyon .
The Vault Hunter fight through a large group of Lance troops clearing and opening the route while also fighting through a tunnel to reach the Sunken Sea .
They must use the Racer to jump an outcrop that secretly had a highway on - ramp leading to the prison called Lockdown Palace .
They find out that Athena was being held prisoner there and the prison leader Shank plans to sell her to the Lance in exchange for her bounty .
After fighting through the prison , the Vault Hunters come across a psycho taking a shower .
He warns them of Shank who shiv's him in the back for not calling him Mr. Shank .
A fight begins with Shank using Athena teleportation device .
After killing Shank , the Vault Hunters find Athena in the main prison block .
A bandit is shown bringing food to her but drops it on the floor .
After meeting Athena , she returns to T - Bone Junction and tells the Vault Hunters through Echo masking her voice with a advertisement for a male enhancement drug .
After meeting with Athena , she tells them that the armory is code locked and tells the Vault to find an ECHO recorder .
Returning to the Ridgeway , they find a Echo recorder under the highway of the Hell 's Highway outpost .
They listen in to 2 Lance soldiers talking with one named Derick enjoying Rocky Road ice cream , while the other asked him if he can have the access code .
Derick reveals that he leave the code at The World 's Largest Bullet , a small attraction in the Sunken Sea with a large artillery shell .
They return to Athena who has built a remote detonator that will destroy the armory .
With the code and detonator in hand , the Vault Hunter 's travel to Road 's End , an area on the other side of the Deep Fathoms .
They fight the Lance on the highway leading to the armory .
They must use the side entrance as the main highway leading into the armory is locked .
Entering the compound , they are introduced to General Knoxx who was just about to kill himself with several weapons .
Instead of killing himself , he decides to fight the Vault Hunters .
After killing General Knoxx , the Vault Hunters can now enter the armory .
Using the code from the Echo ( Blue , Yellow , Cyan , Orange ) they get into the armory , set the timer and have 3 minutes to loot to their hearts desire .

In one striking passage , Mr. Stearns quotes the prophet Ezekiel as saying that the great sin of the people of Sodom was n’t so much that they were promiscuous or gay as that they were “ arrogant , overfed and unconcerned ; they did not help the poor and needy . ” ( Ezekiel 16:49 . )
Hmm .
Imagine if sodomy laws could be used to punish the stingy , unconcerned rich !
The American view of evangelicals is still shaped by preening television blowhards and hypocrites who seem obsessed with gays and fetuses .
One study cited in the book found that even among churchgoers ages 16 to 29 , the descriptions most associated with Christianity were “ antihomosexual , ” “ judgmental , ” “ too involved in politics , ” and “ hypocritical . ”
Some conservative Christians reinforced the worst view of themselves by inspiring Ugandan homophobes who backed a bill that would punish gays with life imprisonment or execution .
Ditto for the Vatican , whose hostility to condoms contributes to the AIDS epidemic .
But there ’s more to the picture : I ’ve also seen many Catholic nuns and priests heroically caring for AIDS patients  even quietly handing out condoms .
One of the most inspiring figures I ’ve met while covering Congo ’s brutal civil war is a determined Polish nun in the terrifying hinterland , feeding orphans , standing up to drunken soldiers and comforting survivors  all in a war zone .
I came back and decided : I want to grow up and become a Polish nun .
Some Americans assume that religious groups offer aid to entice converts .
That ’s incorrect .
Today , groups like World Vision ban the use of aid to lure anyone into a religious conversation .
Some liberals are pushing to end the longtime practice ( it ’s a myth that this started with President George W. Bush ) of channeling American aid through faith - based organizations .
That change would be a catastrophe .
In Haiti , more than half of food distributions go through religious groups like World Vision that have indispensable networks on the ground .
We must n’t make Haitians the casualties in our cultural wars .
A root problem is a liberal snobbishness toward faith - based organizations .
Those doing the sneering typically give away far less money than evangelicals .
They ’re also less likely to spend vacations volunteering at , say , a school or a clinic in Rwanda .
If secular liberals can give up some of their snootiness , and if evangelicals can retire some of their sanctimony , then we all might succeed together in making greater progress against common enemies of humanity , like illiteracy , human trafficking and maternal mortality .

Below is my un-edited guest blog that I did for Greenpeace .
Its ' harmonized ' version can be seen on the Greenpeace site , here .
Blogpost by Alex Hofford , photographer on board the ' MY Esperanza ' , Defending our Pacific ship tour 2011 .
© Greenpeace / Alex Hofford Crew members of the ' Jing Lu Yuan No005 ' are seen hurriedly stuffing dried shark fins into bags and rushing below deck to remove them from view .
Currently I ’m on assignment for Greenpeace as the photographer on board the ‘ MY Esperanza ’ as part of the ‘ Defending the Pacific ‘ tour 2011 .
I arrived at the ship from my adopted home , Hong Kong , about two weeks ago , expecting the worst .
Having done two previous ship tours in 2006 and 2009 , I knew well that things can get dirty and bloody out here in the Pacific on a Greenpeace oceans campaign .
And that ’s not just the politics of the fishing industry .
However nothing could prepare me for what I have seen this week .
© Greenpeace / Alex Hofford
A shortfin mako shark is hacked to death on board the mainland Chinese longline fishing vessel ' Jing Lu Yuan No005 ' .
On Monday , along with a group of activists from Greenpeace , I boarded a small Taiwanese long line fishing vessel , the ‘ Ming Maan Shyang No20 ′ which was fishing in the international waters bordering Micronesia .
The boat was ostensibly targeting tuna , but the freezer was more than 51 % full of sharks .
Included in the catch was an oceanic white tip shark , which , according to the United Nations ( UN ) International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) ‘ Red List of Threatened Species ’ is listed as ‘ vulnerable ‘ .
It is incredible to think that 51 % of their cold storage was being used up for so - called ‘ bycatch ’ , with even threatened species listed in their catch logs .
Worker welfare was on my mind too , as the Philippine and Indonesian crew members were keen to show me their painful calloused hands , injured by handling industrial fishing gear with little protection .
They also showed me their deformed toe - nails , damaged from endless weeks of wearing gum boots sloshing with sea water inside .
It ’s common practice for the richer distant water fishing nations like Japan , South Korea and Taiwan to use impoverished labour from the poor countries of Asia and the the Pacific region .
Their own citizens would never put up with the terrible working conditions endured by the workers that I have encountered this week from developing nations like Vietnam , Papua New Guinea , Indonesia , Philippines , and Vanuatu .
As seen through the prism of the global Occupy movement , it has been with this political dynamic in mind that I have seen how the rich fishing corporations of the distant water fishing nations represent the 1 % , and how these workers earning pittance wages represent the 99 % .
With that in mind I set off the next day to document a second long line fishing vessel , this time from China .
It was the turn of the ‘ Jin Lu Yuan No005 ′ to get an early morning surprise visit from Greenpeace , but this time it would be by helicopter .
Upon arrival , I managed to photograph the crew hurriedly stuffing dried shark fins into bags and rushing below deck to remove them from our view .
Something tells me they had a guilty conscience .
Later that day I returned to the ‘ Jin Lu Yuan No005 ′ to board it along with some Greenpeace activists .
The captain denied all knowledge of our early morning encounter .
Not only did he refuse to show me the bags of shark fin that he had removed from the roof earlier in the day , but he had the gall to counter that the crew had eaten it all for lunch .
Incredulous , and knowing that I had encountered the brick wall that I know so well from other fisheries investigations in China , I spent the remaining time on board his vessel bearing witness to scenes of industrial brutality and butchery .
This included the demise of a mature mako shark that had probably taken thirty or so years to reach adulthood .
If Greenpeace had not been present on board , it would for sure have had it ’s fin sliced off .
But instead the Chinese captain made it clear over the PA system of the boat to the poor crew member from the small Pacific nation of Vanuatu that he should not slice off the fins off the shark whilst we were around .
Instead the worker from Vanuatu was instructed to just cut off the shark ’s head , slice it ’s body open to extract the guts , then chuck it into the ship freezer .
All for what ?
A bowl of soup in Mainland China , Hong Kong or Taiwan ?
At the root cause of shark finning lies greed , consumerism and the current , somewhat creaky , economic model of global capitalism .
For many Chinese that climb out of poverty into the middle class , a shark fin dinner for friends and family is de rigeur .
And let ’s not forget that shark fin was traditionally a dish reserved for the 1 % .
Or that as the scarcity of sharks fin increases , so does its price , and ironically , its desirability .
I believe that the shark fin issue has become the ‘ elephant in the room ’ in the wider arena of fisheries issues in the Asia Pacific region , since it has become increasingly clear that longline fishing boats are now targeting sharks as well as tuna .
Of course there is no proof .
The industry is murky , catch logs can be fudged , and organized crime and corruption are never far away .
But from anecdotal evidence gathered over the years by Greenpeace , it would certainly seem that sharks , not tuna are indeed the new target species .
Take for example the shocking photos seen on my fellow co-author and photographer Paul Hilton ’s blog , which show that the shark fin industry in Taiwan is not only alive and well , but positively thriving .
Runaway seafood consumption patterns around the world , especially in Mainland China , are clearly out of control – and this is driving sharks to the brink of extinction .
The other theory is that the boats are now targeting sharks as stocks of tuna have already been seriously depleted .
It ’s hard to say , but in all likelihood it is probably a combination of both factors .
This is why I have been trying to fuse in people ’s minds the links between the current ‘ Occupy ’ movement of political protests that are sweeping the globe , and the environmental destruction that is going on daily in our oceans .
At any given moment , somewhere in the Pacific ocean , thousands of purse seiners with highly destructive hi-tech fish aggregating devices , or FADs , are scooping out untold amounts of skipjack and yellowfin tuna to fill the daily sandwiches of the lunchtime office crowds in the West .
And thousands of longline fishing vessels , operating with hundreds of thousands of miles of strong plastic lines and millions of hooks , are hunting twenty - four hours a day , 365 days a year in oceans around the world so that consumers in countless restaurants in Asia can dip bite size chunks of yellowfin and bigeye tuna into wasabi and soya sauce mixes .
So who profits from this greed ?
Certainly not the Pacific Islanders , the 99 % , most of whom are steeped in poverty despite their various governments granting fishing licenses to the distant water fishing nations of Asia .
Take Papua New Guinea as an example , where the Greenpeace ship which I am aboard has just come from .
Its capital Port Moresby is famous for rampant poverty , car - jackings , rape , murder , muggings and very poor healthcare .
Except for the exploited fishermen who work on board the boats and in its foreign - owned tuna canneries , the vast majority of the people of Papua New Guinea are not seeing the economic benefits of a foreign fishing industry running amok in its own territorial waters .
Its obvious to me that the root causes of the current crisis in our oceans are indeed the same root causes that the Occupy movement is protesting against .
From Cairo to New York , Kuwait to Hong Kong , ordinary people are waking up politically to the awareness that global capitalism , corrupt politicians , corporate greed and environmental destruction are holding them back from a better life .
So it is for the protesters outside the stock exchange in London , so it is for the voiceless tunas and sharks of the world ’s oceans .
But there has been some progress on the legislative side to ban the sale and possession of shark fin – especially in the United States .
And even though Taiwan enacted its own shark fin law earlier this year which binds fishing companies to land the whole shark along with the fins , like on the ‘ Ming Maan Shyang No20 ′ that I boarded on Monday , it unfortunately does not go far enough .
It ’s a common misconception that if the whole shark is landed and the meat of the body is consumed as food , that this is somehow OK .
At the current rate of depletion , it makes no difference whether or not the whole body is used .
Industrial fishing is wiping out the sharks faster than they can reproduce .
Body or fin alone , the practice is unsustainable and that ’s the problem .
What ’s needed are for the governments of Asia to be bold and enact legislation to ban the sale and possession of shark fin firmly modeled on the bold laws signed this year by the US states of Hawaii , Oregon , Washington and California .
© Greenpeace / Alex Hofford ' Sharkette ' activists from Hong Kong Shark Foundation handing out flyers in Hong Kong 's busy Mong Kok district .
I ’ve been personally involved in shark conservation since 2006 .
First with the ‘ Man & Shark ‘ project and ongoing shark fin investigations in the region , then more recently with a newer NGO , the Hong Kong Shark Foundation .
With some success for over five years now , we have been trying to stem the demand for shark fin in Hong Kong and China .
It ’s a tough gig , but we try to win over school kids , university students and the general public .
We also target the Hong Kong and China governments , industry groups , chambers of commerce , hotels , restaurants and other NGOs to support us .
With our books , our short films , indy band gigs , petitions , shark flash - mobs , shark freeze - mobs and shark plank - mobs , we try to win over the souls of Chinese everywhere .
But what Greenpeace is doing in the Pacific is of equal importance , because instead of targeting demand , the presence of Greenpeace in the Western and Central Pacific ocean is critical to ensure that the supply side does not collapse .
No one is out here to monitor the environmental crimes being committed on a daily basis , in the huge expanses of blue desert that is the Pacific ocean .
Only Greenpeace is doing that .
Of the Pacific island nations that have a patrol boat , fuel is often an issue , as are the huge distances and other logistical problems .
Scientists have pointed to a tipping point for sharks , with population numbers of some species crashing below 90 % in some cases .
Greenpeace is not against fishing per se , but they are campaigning for the establishment of a network of marine reserves and an end to overfishing .
And that means an end to unlicensed , unregulated and illegal fishing operations in the Pacific .
Sustainability is key , for it ’s a fact that shark finning and shark fisheries are unsustainable .
It ’s a common fear in the scientific community that if we allow the oceans to be raped and pillaged at current rates , it is conceivable that the delicate balance of the oceans could be thrown out of kilter forever .
This would have potentially devastating consequences for at least 20 % of humanity that live in poor coastal areas , for whom fish is their main source of protein .
It all boils down to the choice between sustainability ( 99 % ) or corporate greed ( 1 % ) .
My message to the world is ‘ Let ’s Occupy Oceans ! ’

U.S. minority infants are born carrying hundreds of chemicals in their bodies , according to a report released today by an environmental group .
The Environmental Working Group 's study commissioned five laboratories to examine the umbilical cord blood of 10 babies of African - American , Hispanic and Asian heritage and found more than 200 chemicals in each newborn .
" We know the developing fetus is one of the most vulnerable populations , if not the most vulnerable , to environmental exposure , " said Anila Jacobs , EWG senior scientist .
" Their organ systems are n't mature and their detox methods are not in place , so cord blood gives us a good picture of exposure during this most vulnerable time of life . "
Of particular concern to Jacobs : 21 newly detected contaminants , including the controversial plastics additive bisphenol A , or BPA , which mimics estrogen and has been shown to cause developmental problems and precancerous growth in animals .
Last month , researchers reported that male Chinese factory workers exposed to high levels of the chemical experienced erectile dysfunction and other sexual problems .
" BPA is a really important finding because people are really aware about its potential toxicity , " Jacobs told reporters .
" This is the first study to find BPA in umbilical cord blood , and it correlates with national data on it . "
Jacobs said the study focused on minority children to show that chemical exposure is ubiquitous , building on 2005 research on cord blood from 10 anonymous babies .
That study found a similar body burden among the babies .
This is the first study to look at chemicals in minority newborns .
" Minority groups may have increased exposure to certain chemicals , but here we did n't focus on those chemicals , " Jacobs said .
" The sample size is too small to see major differences , but we want to increase awareness about chemical exposures . "
Leo Trasande , co-director of the Children 's Environmental Health Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine , said the findings , while preliminary , show that minority communities are often disproportionately affected by chemical exposure .
Trasande was not involved in the EWG study .
" Presently , minority communities suffer from a host of chronic disorders , and disproportionate chemical exposures may contribute significantly to the origins of the disparities that exist , " Trasande said .
Both he and Jacobs said the findings add momentum for the call to revamp the Toxic Substances Control Act , or TSCA , the law regulating the more than 80,000 chemicals on its database .
They released the report on the same day that a Senate panel is scheduled to discuss the government 's strategy for managing the tens of thousands of chemicals in the marketplace with an eye toward overhauling TSCA .
TSCA does not require most chemicals to be tested for safety before they are approved for widespread use .
Because of this , Trasande said , less than half of the 3,000 high - production volume chemicals on the marketplace have toxicity data , and less than one - fifth have toxicity testing data on the effects on developing organs .
" These results are alarming for their implications of health impacts on children , " Trasande said .
Another challenge facing chemical regulators is understanding how the different chemicals interact together , which is particularly significant given the number of chemicals found in people .
" What we 're finding are complex mixtures of chemicals that sometimes have similar toxicities , " Jacobs said .
" There 's an increased recognition that mixtures are a problem .
...
It 's very difficult to evaluate , but that does n't mean we should n't try .
We should also try to decrease the toxicity of individual chemicals . "

On Dec. 5 , 1933 , Americans liberated themselves from a legal nightmare called Prohibition by repealing the 18th Amendment to the Constitution .
Today most people think Prohibition was fueled by puritanical Protestants who believed drinking alcohol was a sin .
But the vocal minority who made Prohibition law believed they were marching in the footsteps of the abolitionists who sponsored a civil war to end another moral evil — slavery .
Fisher and many other anti-alcohol proponents were fervent believers in eugenics , the science that preached humans could and should control the evolution of the race .
His book , " How to Live : Rules for Healthful Living Based on Modern Science , " was a best seller .
Removing alcohol from the national diet was central to many eugenicists ' belief that an invigorated America would eventually create a race of supermen and women .
The weapon of choice was the local option law by which a majority of voters could ban alcohol from a town , county or state .
By 1900 , 37 states had these laws and the machinery of petitions , letters , telegrams , parades and mass meetings was worked out .
More than 20,000 Anti-Saloon League ( ASL ) speakers were preaching Prohibition in church halls and other public platforms around the country .
Soon whole states had banned alcohol .
In 1907 , Oklahoma entered the Union with a dry Constitution .
In 1913 , Congress passed a law banning the shipment of " intoxicating liquor of any kind " into dry states , making it impossible for individuals to buy a bottle of whiskey without travelling quite a distance to get it .
Angry citizens and liquor industry spokesman appealed to the courts .
Spurred by an ant - gay comic strip which appeared in a student paper a few weeks ago , hundreds of students and some faculty members gathered on the Notre Dame campus to demand more equality for LGBT students .

Researchers in Cork say they have created a vaccine which could in the future be used to effectively protect against prostate cancer .
The Cork Cancer Research Centre at University College Cork says it has identified DNA vaccines that are able to target and destroy cancer cells .
The project is halfway through a process that is estimated to take up to 15 years to complete .
About 1,900 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in Ireland each year .
It is the second most common form of cancer diagnosed in men in this country and up to 900 men die of the disease each year .
Researchers at the Cork Cancer Research Centre at UCC have been working to develop DNA vaccines that activate the immune system against prostate cancer - they say they have created vaccines that have been highly successful in animal trials .
It is hoped that human clinical trials will get under way next year .
Dr Mark Tangney , the principal investigator involved in the research , says the vaccines have been able to seek out and destroy secondary cancerous cells that have spread to other parts of the body .
The vaccines stimulate the immune system , producing anti-bodies that help protect against the disease .
Dr Tangney says that it could be possible to create vaccines for various forms of cancer in the future .
The research is published today in the international journal Genetic Vaccines and Therapy .

Sami wanted to confirm that the seller was legit , so he requested a picture , and received this .
When he examined the image properties , he discovered that the picture was taken in 2008 .
Next , he performed a Google Image search using the size option .
Smart .
He managed to find the image online , located within a Finnish forum thread from 2008 .
That seemed kind of suspicious , so he suggested that the seller provide another picture , with the PS3 alongside a current newspaper .
The deal fell through , of course , when the seller refused .
Not such a clever fraudster , eh ?
He seems to have forgotten how easily things can be found on the Internet using the right tools .
Kudos to Sami for documenting his investigation and for filing a report with the police .
By studying a triple planetary system that resembles a scaled - up version of our own Sun 's family of planets , astronomers have been able to obtain the first direct spectrum -- the " chemical fingerprint " [ 1 ] -- of a planet orbiting a distant star [ 2 ] , thus bringing new insights into the planet 's formation and composition .
The result represents a milestone in the search for life elsewhere in the Universe .
" The spectrum of a planet is like a fingerprint .
It provides key information about the chemical elements in the planet 's atmosphere , " says Markus Janson , lead author of a paper reporting the new findings .
" With this information , we can better understand how the planet formed and , in the future , we might even be able to find tell - tale signs of the presence of life . "
The researchers obtained the spectrum of a giant exoplanet that orbits the bright , very young star HR 8799 .
The system is at about 130 light - years from Earth .
The star has 1.5 times the mass of the Sun , and hosts a planetary system that resembles a scaled - up model of our own Solar System .
Three giant companion planets were detected in 2008 by another team of researchers , with masses between 7 and 10 times that of Jupiter .
They are between 20 and 70 times as far from their host star as the Earth is from the Sun ; the system also features two belts of smaller objects , similar to our Solar System 's asteroid and Kuiper belts .
" Our target was the middle planet of the three , which is roughly ten times more massive than Jupiter and has a temperature of about 800 degrees Celsius , " says team member Carolina Bergfors .
" After more than five hours of exposure time , we were able to tease out the planet 's spectrum from the host star 's much brighter light . "
This is the first time the spectrum of an exoplanet orbiting a normal , almost Sun - like star has been obtained directly .
Previously , the only spectra to be obtained required a space telescope to watch an exoplanet pass directly behind its host star in an " exoplanetary eclipse , " and then the spectrum could be extracted by comparing the light of the star before and after .
However , this method can only be applied if the orientation of the exoplanet 's orbit is exactly right , which is true for only a small fraction of all exoplanetary systems .
The present spectrum , on the other hand , was obtained from the ground , using ESO 's Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) , in direct observations that do not depend on the orbit 's orientation .
As the host star is several thousand times brighter than the planet , this is a remarkable achievement .
" It 's like trying to see what a candle is made of , by observing it from a distance of two kilometres when it's next to a blindingly bright 300 Watt lamp , " says Janson .

The discovery was made possible by the infrared instrument NACO , mounted on the VLT , and relied heavily on the extraordinary capabilities of the instrument 's adaptive optics system [ 3 ] .
Even more precise images and spectra of giant exoplanets are expected both from the next generation instrument SPHERE , to be installed on the VLT in 2011 , and from the European Extremely Large Telescope .
The newly collected data show that the atmosphere enclosing the planet is still poorly understood .
" The features observed in the spectrum are not compatible with current theoretical models , " explains co-author Wolfgang Brandner .
" We need to take into account a more detailed description of the atmospheric dust clouds , or accept that the atmosphere has a different chemical composition from that previously assumed . "
The astronomers hope to soon get their hands on the fingerprints of the other two giant planets so they can compare , for the first time , the spectra of three planets belonging to the same system .
" This will surely shed new light on the processes that lead to the formation of planetary systems like our own , " concludes Janson .
Notes
[ 1 ]
As every rainbow demonstrates , white light can be split up into different colours .
Astronomers artificially split up the light they receive from distant objects into its different colours ( or " wavelengths " ) .
However , where we distinguish five or six rainbow colours , astronomers map hundreds of finely nuanced colours , producing a spectrum -- a record of the different amounts of light the object emits in each narrow colour band .
The details of the spectrum -- more light emitted at some colours , less light at others -- provide tell - tale signs about the chemical composition of the matter producing the light .
This makes spectroscopy , the recording of spectra , an important investigative tool in astronomy .

In 2004 , astronomers used NACO on the VLT to obtain an image and a spectrum of a 5 Jupiter mass object around a brown dwarf -- a " failed star . "
It is however thought that the pair probably formed together , like a petite stellar binary , instead of the companion forming in the disc around the brown dwarf , like a star - planet system .
[ 3 ]
Telescopes on the ground suffer from a blurring effect introduced by atmospheric turbulence .
This turbulence causes the stars to twinkle in a way that delights poets but frustrates astronomers , since it smears out the fine details of the images .
However , with adaptive optics techniques , this major drawback can be overcome so that the telescope produces images that are as sharp as theoretically possible , i.e. approaching conditions in space .
Adaptive optics systems work by means of a computer - controlled deformable mirror that counteracts the image distortion introduced by atmospheric turbulence .
It is based on real - time optical corrections computed at very high speed ( several hundreds of times each second ) from image data obtained by a wavefront sensor ( a special camera ) that monitors light from a reference star .
More information
This research was presented in a paper in press as a Letter to the Astrophysical Journal ( " Spatially resolved spectroscopy of the exoplanet HR 8799 c , " by M. Janson et al . ) .
The team is composed of M. Janson ( University of Toronto , Canada ) , C. Bergfors , M. Goto , W. Brandner ( Max - Planck - Institute for Astronomy , Heidelberg , Germany ) and D. Lafrenière ( University of Montreal , Canada ) .
Preparatory data were taken with the IRCS instrument at the Subaru telescope .
Though rare earth elements are not , geologically speaking , all that rare , they are still largely unknown to the general public .
That , however , could be about to change .
The likes of lanthanum and holmium could soon be names as familiar to us as gold and oil .
The explanation is scarcity .
Global demand for these materials is booming , tripling over the past decade from 40,000 to 120,000 tonnes .
Rare earth elements are used in a host of technologies from iPhones , to fibre - optic cables , to missile guidance systems .
And they are also essential for a swath of low - carbon technologies from catalytic converters , to nuclear power rods ; a market that is set to expand exponentially over the coming decades as nations seek to reduce their use of fossil fuels .
Yet one country has a virtual monopoly on the production of these materials .
China provides 97 per cent of the global supplies of rare earth elements , most coming from a single mine in Inner Mongolia .
By 2014 global demand for rare earth materials is forecast to hit 200,000 tonnes a year .
But for several years China has been steadily reducing the amount of material it makes available for export .
And as we report today , supplies of Chinese - produced terbium and dysprosium – irreplaceable elements of magnets used in the batteries of hybrid cars and wind turbines – are likely to be cut sharply in the coming months .
In theory , the global free market should dictate supply and demand of a scarce commodity .
But China , in common with other powerful nations , does not always play by such rules .
Beijing seems keen to hoard materials for its own expected future needs and also to ensure that all raw rare earth material is processed within its borders .
China apparently wants to build its share of lucrative rare earth component manufacture market .
This is likely to prove extremely disruptive for the rest of the world .
A sudden cut in supply is going to have painful knock - on effects for many high - technology industries in developed countries .
The obvious response is to seek other suppliers .
And rare earth mines are being developed in South Africa , Greenland and Canada .
But these mines are at least five years away from being able to generate a significant level of production .
A transition will , of course , be made in time .
Yet it could be an extremely painful process .
It need not be this way .
There are , it is true , potential short - term gains to be had by China from constricting supply of these valuable raw commodities .
But it is certainly not in China 's long - term interests to antagonise its trading partners by behaving in this fashion .
Nor would it be wise for Beijing to allow the development of low - carbon technologies elsewhere in the world to be retarded by its policies .
China , just as much ( if not more ) than other nations , stands to reap benefits from low - carbon industrial development .
Beijing is a huge importer of expensive oil and increasingly reliant on highly - polluting coal to power its economic growth .
And its territory is extremely vulnerable to the malign impact of climate change .

Are Federal Reserve and U.S. Government Rigging Stock Market ?
We Have No Evidence They Are , but They Could Be. We Do Not Know Source of Money That Pushed Market Cap Up $ 6 + Trillion since Mid-March .
The most positive economic development in 2009 was the stock market rally .
Since the middle of March , the market cap of all U.S. stocks has soared more than $ 6 trillion .
The “ wealth effect ” of rising stock prices has soothed the nerves and boosted the net worth of the half of Americans who own stock .
We cannot identify the source of the new money that pushed stock prices up so far so fast .
For the most part , the money did not from the traditional players that provided money in the past :
Companies .
Corporate America has been a huge net seller .
The float of shares has ballooned $ 133 billion since the start of April .
Retail investor funds .
Retail investors have hardly bought any U.S. equities .
Bond funds , yes .
U.S equity funds , no .
U.S. equity funds and ETFs have received just $ 17 billion since the start of April .
Over that same time frame bond mutual funds and ETFs received $ 351 billion .
Retail investor direct .
We doubt retail investors were big direct purchases of equities .
Market volatility in this decade has been the highest since the 1930s , and we no evidence retail investors were piling into individual stocks .
Also , retail investor sentiment has been mostly neutral since the rally began .
Foreign investors .
Foreign investors have provided some buying power , purchasing $ 109 billion in U.S. stocks from April through October .
But we suspect foreign purchases slowed in November and December because the U.S. dollar was weakening .
Hedge funds .
We have no way to track in real time what hedge funds do , and they may well have shifted some assets into U.S. equities .
But we doubt their buying power was enormous because they posted an outflow of $ 12 billion from April through November .
Pension funds .
All the anecdotal evidence we have indicates that pension funds have not been making a huge asset allocation shift and have not moved more than about $ 100 billion from bonds and cash into U.S. equities since the rally began .
If the money to boost stock prices did not come from the traditional players , it had to have come from somewhere else .
We do not know where all the money has come from .
What we do know is that the U.S. government has spent hundreds of billions of dollars to support the auto industry , the housing market , and the banks and brokers .
Why not support the stock market as well ?
As far as we know , it is not illegal for the Federal Reserve or the U.S. Treasury to buy S&P 500 futures .
Moreover , several officials have suggested the government should support stock prices .
For example , former Fed board member Robert Heller opined in the Wall Street Journal in 1989 , “ Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market , thereby stabilizing the market as a whole . ”
In a Financial Times article in 2002 , an unidentified Fed official was quoted as acknowledging that policymakers had considered buying U.S. equities directly , not just futures .
The official mentioned that the Fed could “ theoretically buy anything to pump money into the system . ”
In an article in the Daily Telegraph in 2006 , former Clinton administration official George Stephanopoulos mentioned the existence of “ an informal agreement among the major banks to come in and start to buy stock if there appears to be a problem . ”
Think back to mid-March 2009 .
Nothing positive was happening , and investor sentiment was horrible .
The Fed , the Treasury , and Wall Street were all trying to figure out how to prevent the financial system from collapsing .
The Fed was willing to print whatever amount of money it took to bail out the system .
What if Ben Bernanke , Timothy Geithner , and the head of one or more Wall Street firms decided that creating a stock market rally was the only way to rescue the economy ?
After all , after - tax income was down more than 10 % y- o -y during Q1 2009 , and the trillions the government committed or spent to prop up all sorts of entities was not working .
One way to manipulate the stock market would be for the Fed or the Treasury to buy $ 20 billion , plus or minus , of S&P 500 stock futures each month for a year .
Depending on margin levels , $ 20 billion per month would translate into at least $ 100 billion in notional buying power .
Given the hugely oversold market early in March , not only would a new $ 100 billion per month of buying power have stopped stock prices from plunging , but it would have encouraged huge amounts of sideline cash to flow into equities to absorb the $ 300 billion in newly printed shares that have been sold since the start of April .
This type of intervention could explain some of the unusual market action in recent months , with stock prices grinding higher on low volume even as companies sold huge amounts of new shares and retail investors stayed on the sidelines .
For example , Tyler Durden of ZeroHedge has pointed out that virtually all of the market ’s upside since mid-September has come from after - hours S&P 500 futures activity .
If we were involved in a scheme to manipulate the stock market , we would want to keep it in place until after the “ wealth effect ” put a floor under the economy of , say , three quarters of positive GDP growth .
Assuming the economy were performing better , then ending the support for stock prices would be justified because a stock market decline would not be so painful .
We want to emphasize that we have no evidence that the Fed or the Treasury are throwing money into the stock market , either directly or indirectly .
But if they are not pumping up stock prices , then who else is ?
Equity Mutual Fund Cash Equal to 3.8 % of Assets in November , Just above Record Low of 3.5 % in Mid-2007 .
U.S. Equity Funds Get Estimated $ 5.1 Billion in December , First Inflow in Five Months .
The Investment Company Institute reported Wednesday that equity mutual funds held just 3.8 % of their assets in cash and equivalents in November .
To put this percentage into perspective , the record low was 3.5 % in June 2007 and July 2007 .
While the amount of cash increased $ 8.1 billion in November , assets shot up $ 229.1 billion , leaving the ratio of cash to assets unchanged .
Source : Investment Company Institute .
U.S. equity fund flows reversed sharply in December .
After posting fairly large outflows from September through November , U.S. equity funds received an estimated $ 5.1 billion ( 0.1 % of assets ) this month .
Apart from the shift in U.S. equity fund flows , mutual fund flows did not change much in December .
Global equity funds continued to post moderate inflows , taking in an estimated $ 7.1 billion ( 0.7 % of assets ) .
This month ’s inflow is in line with the inflows of $ 7.8 billion in October and $ 6.0 billion in November .
Finally , bond funds continued to rake in huge amounts of cash .
They received an estimated $ 25.8 billion ( 1.2 % of assets ) , putting them on track to post an unprecedented ninth consecutive monthly inflow exceeding $ 25 billion .
Mutual fund investors tend to be poor market timers .
Based strictly on mutual fund flows , the clear contrarian play would be to short bonds right now .
This year ’s record inflow of $ 375 billion into bond funds is 44 % higher than the record inflow of $ 260 billion into U.S. equity funds at the stock market top in 2000 .
Note : Flows for December 2009 are estimates based on our daily survey and data from the Investment Company Institute .
We Plan to Stay Neutral ( 0 % Long ) on U.S. Equities This Weekend .
Investment Demand Remains Favorable : TrimTabs Demand Index Bullish at 58.9 on December 29 .
We plan to stay neutral ( 0 % long ) on U.S. equities in our model portfolio .
As we discussed Tuesday , real - time income tax data shows no sign of a recovery in the U.S. economy .
But we do not want to be short mostly because investment demand is favorable .
The TrimTabs Demand Index ( TTDI ) , which uses 21 flow and sentiment variables to assess overall investment demand was 58.9 on Tuesday , December 29 .
While this reading is well below the interim high of 77.1 on Friday , December 18 , it is still above the neutrality line of 50 .
The index is so bullish mostly because indicators that tend to be leading — notably excess margin debt and the cash balance of equity mutual funds — are indicative of greed .
Corporate Liquidity Likely to Be Neutral to Bullish Next Week .
New Offering Calendar Will Be Virtually Shut Down , While Corporate Buying Likely to Remain Light .
Another reason we plan to stay on the sidelines is that corporate liquidity is likely to be neutral to bullish next week .
On the sell side , new offerings are likely to be light because underwriters will just be returning from extended vacations .
New offerings amounted to just $ 350 million in the week ended Wednesday , December 23 , and they are almost certain to be lower this week ( Dealogic reports that less than $ 50 million is scheduled for later this week in addition to the $ 4 million that priced Thursday through Tuesday ) .
On the buy side , the economy ’s weakness suggests corporate buying is unlikely to surge into the New Year .
Nevertheless , new cash takeovers and new stock buybacks combined are likely to rival or exceed new offerings next week .
Taking a look back , corporate liquidity was extremely bearish in December .
The $ 75.5 billion in corporate selling ( new offerings + net insider selling ) was 4.2 times the $ 18.0 billion in announced corporate buying ( new cash takeovers + new stock buybacks ) .
Yet corporate selling was highly concentrated , with large follow - on deals for three big TARP banks accounting for 79 % of the corporate selling .
We expect corporate liquidity to turn bearish again starting in the third week of January as companies take advantage of bubbly stock prices to unload more new shares .
Since the start of the great anti-slavery republican insurrection nearly 220 years ago , Haiti has been presented as a dangerous place incapable of running its own affairs and requiring foreign intervention .
Yet the reality is its people were the first enslaved population to deliver themselves from slavery and also carried out what was only the third successful republican insurrection on the planet .
The threat of this good example was rewarded with centuries of invasion , blackmail , the robbery of Haiti 's natural resources and the impoverishment of its people .
This articles summarizes that history of intervention and the resistance to it in order to put into context what is happening in Haiti after the quake .
It was written s predictions for the death toll from the Haitian earthquakes rise over 200,000 , ABC News have reported that planes carrying medical equipment and relief supplies are having to compete with soldiers for the valuable slots at Port - au - Prince airport which was taken over by the US military after the quake .
PDF pamphlet of this article [ Greek translation ]
This is not an academic exercise .
The propaganda methods that were used during the Haitian revolution to frighten off support for the rebels from radical organisations elsewhere - like the London Corresponding Society - continue to be used to the present day .
Right after the earthquake , Time Magazine was writing , " As Haitian and international officials try to coordinate an effective relief response to what is probably the worst disaster to ever hit the western hemisphere 's poorest country , they 'll need to be mindful of the human rats that come out of the capital 's woodwork at times like these " , under the scary headline ' Will Criminal Gangs Take Control in Haiti's Chaos ? '
Yet aid workers on the ground , in contrast , were reporting the stoicism and solidarity of the people in desperate conditions and even the UN Commander said the streets were safer than before the quake .
An Irish doctor from Médecins Sans Frontières confirmed on radio that they were working in Cité Soleil were operating unguarded and unhampered inspite of the areas reputation .
This idea of Haiti as riddled with ( poor , black ) terror gangs waiting to pounce on naive ( white ) visitors goes back to the rebellion and , in the context of the earthquake , is resulting in additional deaths , as has been made clear by a London Times ' article titled ' Fear of the poor is hampering Haiti rescue . '
Conquest , slavery and resistance
Foreign intervention goes back to the time before the Haitian revolution .
Haiti is the western 1/3 of an island which Columbus came across on his first voyage to the Americas and claimed for Spain , ignoring the fact it was already populated by an estimated 4 - 500,000 Taino people .
He called the island Hispaniola , the people who lived there called it Haiti - the name that was restored when the republic was declared .
Columbus had heard there was a lot of gold on the island so he left 39 of his crew there who built a fort with Taino help called La Navidad , the crew were ordered to explore the island and gather gold .
He recorded that " I have ordered a tower and fortress to be constructed and , a large cellar , not because I believe there is any necessity on account of [ the natives ] ..
I am certain the people I have with me could subjugate all this island … as the population are naked and without arms and very cowardly . "
However , when he returned the following year on his second voyage he discovered the fortress destroyed with the corpses of his men on the beach as the Taino population had risen up against them in response to mistreatment , which included the kidnapping of Taino women .
His second voyage included 17 ships and 1200 settlers and with this force Columbus demanded that every Taino over the age of 14 deliver a hawks bell full of gold every three months .
If they failed to do so they had their hands cut off and were left to bleed to death .
On or before 1511 a Taino Cacique ( chief ) called Hatuey left Hispaniola for Cuba with 400 others in canoes to warn the people that a Spanish expedition was under way to conquer them .
Bartolomé de Las Casas the radical Spanish priest who had previously been a plantation owner in Hispaniola wrote that Hatuey showed them a basket of gold and jewels and told them " Here is the God the Spaniards worship .
For these they fight and kill ; for these they persecute us and that is why we have to throw them into the sea ...
They tell us , these tyrants , that they adore a God of peace and equality , and yet they usurp our land and make us their slaves .
They speak to us of an immortal soul and of their eternal rewards and punishments , and yet they rob our belongings , seduce our women , violate our daughters . "
Hatuey conducted a guerrilla war against the Spaniards before being captured and burned alive on February 2 1512 .
In 1522 another Taino Cacique led a revolt of as many as 3000 in the Bahoruco mountains on Hispaniola itself which forced a treaty from the Spaniards .
Within 30 years so many ( up to 90 % ) of the Taino had been worked to death in the gold mines or died of starvation or disease that the Spanish started transporting enslaved Africans to replace them .
This was the pattern across the Spanish - occupied Caribbean ; according to Bartolomé de Las Casas " it was a general rule among Spaniards to be cruel , not just cruel , but extraordinarily cruel so that harsh and bitter treatment would prevent Indians from daring to think of themselves as human beings .
As they saw themselves each day perishing by the cruel and inhuman treatment of the Spaniards , crushed to the earth by the horses , cut in pieces by swords , eaten and torn by dogs , many buried alive and suffering all kinds of exquisite tortures . "
The Tainos however were never completely wiped out , a couple of hundred survivors set up free settlements with escaped Africans in the mountains .
The first significant insurrection of enslaved African also occurred in 1522 when Wolof people on the sugar plantation of Columbus 's son rose with many escaping to the mountains after the rebellion .
These ' Maroon ' communities continued to resist the Spanish , by the 1530s Plantation owners had to travel in large armed groups .
They referred to the communities as Cimarrones or ' wild animals ' , a striking similarity to Time Magazine 's use of the term " human rats " for Haitians today .
The Spanish colony declined in particular after the conquest of the American mainland began , with many settlers leaving for the silver mines .
Conditions of increased poverty resulted in a breakdown of the racial divisions and the population came to be mostly composed of people of mixed Taino , Spaniard and African descent .
In 1605 , Spain launched an attack on the settlements outside of Santo Domingo ( now capital of the Dominican Republic ) , this is now known as the devastaciones because half the people died after been forced to move closer to the city where they could be controlled .
The division of the island took place in 1697 after France and Spain had fought an imperialist war over it .
The French part was then called Saint - Domingue and had attracted 30,000 French settlers in a few decades due to the vast fortunes to be made from sugar , coffee , rum , cotton and indigo .
It led the world in the production of these items and by three - fourths of the world 's sugar was produced there .
The enslaved Africans who worked the plantations lived and died under the brutal Code Noir ; it 's estimated that 1/3 died within the first couple of years of their transportation , in this period 29,000 Africans were being transported to Haiti every year .
One man who spent half his life in slavery later wrote of what he witnessed : " Have they not hung up men with heads downward , drowned them in sacks , crucified them on planks , buried them alive , crushed them in mortars ?
Have they not forced them to eat excrement ?
And , having flayed them with the lash , have they not cast them alive to be devoured by worms , or onto ant hills , or lashed them to stakes in the swamp to be devoured by mosquitoes ?
Have they not thrown them into boiling cauldrons of cane syrup ?
Have they not put men and women inside barrels studded with spikes and rolled them down mountainsides into the abyss ?
Have they not consigned these miserable blacks to man-eating dogs until the latter , sated by human flesh , left the mangled victims to be finished off with bayonet and poniard ? "
Organised rebellion and the world 's 3rd republic
The first sustained organised rebellion was in the 1750s , led by François Mackandal until he was captured and burned alive by the settlers in 1758 .
By 1789 , there were around 40,000 white settlers and 500,000 enslaved Africans as well as a growing population of people of color ( ‘ mulattoes ’ as they were then known ) many of whose origins were in the rape of African women by white slave owners .
Unlike the plantation system of the US such offspring were ' free ' and , although discriminated against in many ways , could own land and even enslave black people themselves .
There were some 26,000 free people of color and a few were wealthy but even these few did not share the political rights of the white population .
In the aftermath of the publication of the Declaration of the Rights of Man during the French Revolution on 26 August 1789 , one of them , Vincent Oge who had recently returned from revolutionary France , demanded the right to vote and , when this was refused , led a small rebellion .
When captured , he was executed by being broken on the wheel ; a method of execution where the victim is tied to a cart wheel , has their limbs smashed with hammers and is left to die .
The roots of the violence that the people of Haiti suffer surely lie in the extreme brutality used to maintain slavery .
Shortly after the execution of Oge , the French Revolutionary government granted citizenship to wealthy , free people of color .
The large landowners who ran the island refused to implement this law .
Rumors were also circulating that slavery was to abolished by France , these were untrue but probably based on the activity of an abolitionist society in Paris and preparation began for a rising .
The largest plantations were in the northern part of the island and it was there that the enslaved people rose on 22 August , taking the northern province over the next 10 days .
By 1792 1/3 of the island was in the hands of these black republicans .
France , for economic and then military reasons ( the republic was at war with Britain and Spain ) , was forced to make concessions .
By 1793 , these concessions had built up to the French commander , Sonthonax , freeing all the enslaved people after negotiations with the black leaders of the rebellion which included Toussaint L'Ouverture .
Sonthonax who was sent to Haiti with 7,000 troops in 1792 had been a member of the abolitionist French ' Society of the Friends of the Blacks ' which demanded that the ideas of the French revolution be extended to the colonies , Oge had also been a member of this society .
In return they then helped the French defeat the British and Spanish .
In reality , the French were just giving legal recognition to the fact the people had already liberated themselves however Sonthonax also gave citizenship to all .
This meant that Haitian delegates , some of whom had been enslaved , traveled to France for the 1794 National Assembly .
The Assembly not only confirmed the abolition of slavery on Haiti , it extended the abolition to the entire French empire .
An invading British army was defeated and , in 1801 , an army under Toussaint invaded Santo Domingo to aid with the abolition of slavery there .
In 1802 , Napoleon sent a huge army to the island to attempt to re-impose slavery but , after a brutal war , it too was defeated despite receiving US backing in the form of 750,000 dollars in military aid .
The US , with its large slave economy , was not keen on the idea of a free republic created by enslaved people that could serve as an example to its own enslaved population .
During that war the second French commander , Rochambeau , wrote to Napoleon saying France must " declare the negroes slaves , and destroy at least 30,000 negroes and negresses " in order to win .
Under Rochambeau , the " French burned alive , hanged , drowned , and tortured black prisoners , reviving such practices as burying blacks in piles of insects and boiling them in cauldrons of molasses . "
After one battle , 500 prisoners were buried alive .
As well as causing immense human suffering , Napoleon ’s bloody attempt to re-conquer the island for French imperialism did enormous economic damage .
50,000 French soldiers died in the war , including 18 generals .
Around 100 Polish troops fighting with the French changed sides to fight with the Haitians and , because of this , while the rest of the white population were slaughtered or driven out at the end of the war , Polish settlers were told they could stay and around 400 did so .
Toussaint L'Ouverture never saw the declaration of independence in 1804 , however .
He was captured a few months into the war and sent to France where he died in prison .
The resistance was led by Jean - Jacques Dessalines and François Capois .
Toussaints last words before dying in prison were " In overthrowing me , you have cut down in Saint - Domingue only the tree of liberty .
It will spring up again by the roots for they are numerous and deep . "
The Haitian revolution began some seven years before the first great republican revolution in Ireland in 1798 and lasted through the Emmett rebellion of 1803 as well .
CLR James writes that Napoleon recalled General Humbert from his Irish liberation expedition for his war against Haiti .
Yet outside of Haiti , its existence is almost unknown .
The self - liberation of hundreds of thousands of enslaved people is very much less known then the later and staggered abolition of slavery in Britain and France , an abolition that was driven in part by the rebellions of enslaved people elsewhere sparked off by the Haitian example .
It is clear why , in the aftermath of the revolution , it was not in the interests of the slave holders elsewhere at the time to spread the news of the liberation of the people of Haiti by their own hands .
In 1816 for instance , Bussa 's rebellion engulfed Barbados .
Inspired in part by news of Haiti , hundreds of enslaved people rose , a quarter of the sugar cane was burnt and almost 1000 enslaved people were either killed in the battles or executed after the rebellion was defeated .
Instead they continued to economically punish Haiti .
The people of Haiti escaped slavery but they could not defeat the colonial system which has continued to punish them to this day .
Aftermath of the rebellion
As with many successful revolutions , victory was followed by reaction and civil war .
Toussaint L'Ouverture had restored the plantation system , invited back the planters and forced the freed people to work on the plantations , this time for a wage .
After independence General Dessalines continued this policy and declared himself Emperor but was assassinated by two of his advisors in 1806 .
They then partitioned Haiti with one of them , Petion , establishing the ' Republic of Haiti ' in the southern part , in which the estates were broken up and the land distributed .
The northern part was under Christophe who continued something every like the old plantation system .
Both parts were reunited in 1820 under Petion 's successor .
The young Haitian republic of Petion provided financial and military aid as well as soldiers to Simon Bolivar between 1815 and 1817 as he fought to liberate South America from Spanish rule on the condition he would free enslaved people there .
And for twenty years from 1822 the entire island was briefly unified under Hatian rule that saw the abolition of slavery in the eastern two thirds .
However in 1825 France sent an invasion fleet to the island .
In order to prevent the invasion , the president had to agree to ‘ repay ’ France 150 million Francs for lost profits from the slave trade .
The French abolitionist Victor Schoelcher wrote that " Imposing an indemnity on the victorious slaves was equivalent to making them pay with money that which they had already paid with their blood . "
In return , France recognised Haitian independence while the US did not ; even though Haiti was forced to borrow money from the US to pay the French , money that was still being repaid by Haiti as late as 1947 .
Recognition by Britain and France did not end Haiti's woes or foreign interference .
There have been 32 coups , most arising from conflicts within the ruling class and the various foreign business groups .
Apart from these , Haiti was not to be recognised by the US until 1862 .
This recognition , which only came about as the US was abolishing slavery in a bloody civil war where the Union needed Haitian ports , had little real meaning , as military interference continued .
In 1888 , the US Marines sponsored a coup in the island and by 1913 , US Warships had entered Haitian waters on 24 occasions .
Then in 1914 , in response to a peasant insurrection , the US Marines invaded the island and remained in occupation for over 20 years , during which time they killed , officially , over 3000 Haitians who resisted , including over 400 who were executed .
Some Haitian historians have put the real death toll at 15,000 .
The US occupation imposed a new constitution which allowed foreign companies to own land .
In a warning for what lies in wait for the survivors of the Haitian earthquake , the US State Department justified this as being in the interests of the Haitian people , reporting that " It was obvious that if our occupation was to be beneficial to Haiti and further her progress it was necessary that foreign capital should come to Haiti ... and Americans could hardly be expected to put their money into plantations and big agricultural enterprises in Haiti if they could not themselves own the land on which their money was to be spent . "
In reality , these changes saw peasant freeholders forced off the land to become labourers in the vast plantations that US corporations created as they bought up that land .
It was this invasion that Marine General Smedley Butler was referring to when he said " I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in . "
It was Butler who had dissolved the National Assembly when it refused to ratify the US drafted constitution .
Butler had also resurrected an old French law to force peasants to work as unpaid laborers building roads to enable the US military to rapidly move around on the island .
During World War II peasants were expelled from more than 100,000 hectares to make room for rubber plantations producing for the US military and , although the US had withdrawn its military forces by 1934 , it retained control of Haiti 's foreign finances until 1947 .
In his book Year 501 : The Conquest Continues , Noam Chomsky quoted a New York business daily from 1926 , which described conditions in Haiti as " a marvelous opportunity for American investment " : " The run -of - the - mill Haitian is handy , easily directed , and gives a hard day 's labor for 20 cents , while in Panama the same day 's work cost $ 3 . "
As plantation agriculture displaced peasants into urban slums , these advantages for US corporations grew so that the 13 companies active in 1966 had become 154 by 1981 , accounting for 40 % of Haiti ’s exports .
The Docs and the IMF
Haiti was also a victim of the Cold War anti-' communist ' backlash , having to endure the bloodthirsty Duvalier dictatorship which ran from 1957 to 1986 first under Francois Duvalier ( known as Papa Doc ) and then under his son Jean - Claude or Baby Doc. Francois had come to power as a populist on the basis of a combination of black nationalism and voodoo , but his initial reforms were soon replaced by a personal dictatorship .
Their rule was in part maintained through death squads , known as the Tonton Macoutes , who were kept loyal by being given land confiscated from peasants .
It 's estimated that over 30,000 Haitians were killed under this regime .
Throughout this period the US continued military and economic aid as thousands of Haitians fled the country .
This foreign investment , counter to neoliberal orthodoxy , did not bring prosperity .
In fact alongside IMF - ordered Structural Adjustment Programs ( SAPs ) , poverty soared ; by 1986 , 60 % of Haitians were earning less than 60 dollars a year .
This was not helped by the USAID - World Bank development strategy begun in 1981 which had the goal of forcing the economy “ toward deeper market interdependence with the United States . "
This was achieved by shifting 30 % of the arable land from food for local consumption to export cash crops .
Twenty years ago Haiti produced enough rice to feed its own population , today 75 % of the rice eaten is imported from the US making it the third largest importer of US rice in the world .
Haitian rice production was wrecked not only by the shift to cash crops , but also by the dumping of surplus , subsidized US rice , driving Haitian producers out of production .
Chicken production was similarly destroyed by the dumping of dark chicken meat , which US consumers find unacceptable , in Haiti .
Finally pig production was wrecked by US insistence on the mass slaughter of domestic Haitian pigs and their replacement with other varieties that proved much more vulnerable to disease
The World Bank recommended that private enterprize be expanded through privatisation of social services and minimizing the cost ( to the state ) of education .
Over 80 % of education for Haitian children is now private .
Tens of thousands tried to flee this poverty by building rafts and setting out for the US , but unlike Cubans who were generally fleeing less extreme conditions almost none were given refugee status and thousands were deported back to lives of misery and cheap labour for US corporations .
On the positive side , 1986 saw the overthrowal of the ' Baby Doc' Duvalier dictatorship .
When , in 1985 , the people of Haiti had risen up again against the Duvalier dictatorship , one of their first acts was to pull down the Port - au - Prince statue of Christopher Columbus and throw it into the sea , demonstrating that ordinary Haitian people understand the role foreign intervention has played in their past even if few outside do .
Aristide and Lavalas
As Duvalier was taken into exile by the US Air Force , General Henri Namphy was backed by the US as a replacement .
He was opposed by the populist priest Jean - Bertrand Aristide , but the 1987 elections saw the use of death squads and Aristide ’s church was attacked shortly afterwards , forcing him to flee after 13 had been killed and 77 injured .
Aristide stood at the last minute in the 1990 elections and won 67 % of the vote .
The second place candidate , a World Bank official , received only 14 % despite being backed by the US .
No worries , Aristide was only allowed seven months between his inauguration in February 1991 and a coup backed by the old economic elite that September .
In the two weeks after the coup , the army killed over 1000 people and up to 5000 were killed by death squads under the junta .
They targeted radical unions and community groups in particular .
The Organisation of American States voted to impose sanctions on Haiti but the US ensured these were ineffective and it later emerged that both Bush and Clinton had secretly given the OK for Texaco Oil Corporation to pass the ‘ blockade ’ .
What the blockade did do was intercept some 42,000 Haitians trying to flee the murderous regime by boat and force them to return to Haiti .
After the military had a few years to repress the popular movements , the US forced the junta to step down by sending thousands of Marines and Special Forces to Haiti , occupying it for just over six months .
Under occupation the US imposed a compromise ‘ national unity government ’ when brought together Aristide ( who had got 67 % of the vote ) , the old elite who had got 1.7 % of the vote and the army who had the guns .
Out of this the US - preferred candidate from the elections was made Prime Minister despite the fact he ’d only received 14 % in the elections and his program of neoliberal restructuring was imposed .
" Aristide agreed to pay the debts accumulated under the kleptocratic Duvalier dictatorships , slash the civil service , open up Haiti to " free trade ’ and cut import tariffs on rice and corn in half . "
In 1996 Aristide ’s original Prime Minister was elected President with 88 % of the vote .
In 2000 , Aristide was again elected President with almost 92 % of the vote but the turn out was low due to an opposition boycott of the elections .
The US used this as an excuse to cut off much needed aid , much of which was funneled instead to opposition groups over the next four years .
In a 2006 interview Aristide was keen to not claim credit for the popular movements but rather said his election was an " expression of the mobilisation of the people as a whole " .
This is also argued by activist journalist Patrick Elie who was a junior cabinet minister during Aristide 's first presidency .
In a 2003 Znet interview , he describes the post - Duvalier " profound movement within the Haitian population that would turn into thousands of grassroots organizations .
It was this movement that was the origin of the Haitian saga of the last 20 years .
It was this movement rather than the political parties that stood up against the return of dictatorship .
It was this movement that confronted the military government when it tried to control the election in 1987 and this movement that swept Aristide into power in 1990 ...
Lavalas is a political philosophy , not a party .
Lavalas and the popular movement are one in the same .
It was the name coined for it by President Aristide .
But he did not invent the reality of it , he just put a name on it .
He does n't own it .
It owns him . "
Patrick is one of the critical voices about the development of Lavalas saying at the end of 2005 that " there was no strategy put forward by Fanmi Lavalas .
They only had a slogan ; ' Bring President Aristide back . '
And I 'd like to compare it to the situation back in the war of independence when the French came in and snatched away Toussaint Louverture .
The masses then did not say ' Bring Louverture back , ' they developed an alternative toward independence which had become indispensable because it was the only way to secure the abolishment of slavery . "
In 2003 Aristide demanded that France repay Haiti 21 billion , the equivalent of all the money Haiti had been forced to pay France from the treaty of 1825 as ‘ compensation ’ for the abolition of slavery .
On February 4th a rebel group called the National Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Haiti seized control of Gonaïves , the fourth biggest city .
This group had until September 2003 been the main gang in that city and had been known as the Cannibal Army , the name was changed in the aftermath of the murder of their leader , a former Aristide supporter , in that month .
It ’s claimed that the group had been backed by the US and included former death squad members , in any case they rapidly ' took ' Cap - Haïtien , the second biggest city and then advanced on the capital .
In his 2006 interview Aristide said " There was no great insurrection : there was a small group of soldiers , heavily armed , who were able to overwhelm some police stations , kill some policemen and create a certain amount of havoc .
The police had run out of ammunition , and were no match for the rebels ' M16s .
But the city was a different story .
The people were ready , and I was n't worried . "
It was later claimed by Aristide 's lawyer that that at least some of the M - 16s used by the rebels were those that the United States had given to the Dominican military a year previously .
Naomi Klein interviewed Aristide in 2005 and reported that , back in 1994 , after the first coup , “ Washington ’s negotiators made one demand that Aristide could not accept : the immediate selloff of Haiti ’s state - owned enterprises , including phones and electricity .
Aristide argued that unregulated privatization would transform state monopolies into private oligarchies , increasing the riches of Haiti ’s elite and stripping the poor of their national wealth . "
In her article reporting this , Klein also wrote of the 2004 coup that " Turning Haiti over to this underworld gang out of concern for Aristide ’s lack of " good governance " is like escaping an annoying date by accepting a lift home from Charles Manson . "
As the rebels approached Port - au - Prince , France used its veto in the UN to block the deployment of a peace keeping force .
At this point , Aristide was kidnapped from his home by US marines and bundled on a flight to the Central African Republic where the government arrested and detained him .
After this , and just three days after the original UN vote , France voted for the deployment of ‘ peacekeepers ’ and then , the occupation of Haiti , which has continued to the present , began .
The proxy occupation
The occupation is called the United Nations Stabilization Mission ( MINUSTAH ) and it is significant for involving the militaries and police from a wide range of South and Central American countries , led by the Brazilian army .
This composition has attracted less international opposition that an occupying force made for the old imperialist powers would be but in 2005 , the then MINUSTAH force commander , Lieutenant - General Augusto Heleno Ribeiro Pereira testified at a congressional commission in Brazil that " we are under extreme pressure from the international community to use violence " , mentioning Canada , France , and the United States in particular as the source of that pressure .
The US peacekeepers declared war on neighborhoods where the social movements were active and in particular on Cité Soleil , home to up to 300,000 people , which was originally designed to house workers for the local Export Processing Zone .
A July 6th 2005 raid on the Cité Soleil shanty town probably saw at least 20 killed .
75 % of the wounded who turned up at one clinic were women and children .
Estimates of the number killed that day have been as high as 80 .
Cité Soleil has a permanent security checkpoint with armored vehicles at its entrance and is the target of regular mass incursions by the occupying forces .
In February 2007 some 700 UN troops and police took part in one such incursion , the previous month another raid had officially killed four and injured six .
The UN claims this is to stop criminal activity but many see it as an attempt to crush the social movements .
In any case this methodology of ' policing ' would never be accepted in New York , Paris or London so why would Haitians have to accept it ?
An April 2007 report in The Observer told how after the UN had killed three children they fired tear gas and plastic bullets at a 2,000 strong demonstration against the killings , hitting one of the reporters in the back of the head and causing multiple vehicle crashes .
A 2005 report from the Harvard Law Student Advocates for Human Rights claimed that the UN " effectively provided cover for the police to wage a campaign of terror in Port - au - Prince 's slums " which are " an unflinching bastion of support for Aristide and for Lavalas . "
An earlier November 2004 investigation by the University of Miami School of Law found that " summary executions are a police tactic . "
Haiti is the poorest country in the Americas today , and even ahead of the earthquake , most of the population live in extreme poverty , 70 % living on less than 2 dollars a day .
The global rise in food prices in 2008 resulted in major riots in April during which the UN occupation forces shot several people dead and injured dozens .
Crowds chanting
" We are hungry !
He must go ! " tried to storm the presidential palace demanding the resignation of President Rene Preval .
They were driven away by Brazilian UN troops with assault rifles , tear gas and rubber bullets .
According to Al Jazeera the food shortages were also caused by " new customs procedures aimed at collecting revenues and stopping the flow of drugs " which had " left tons of food rotting in ports , especially in the country 's north . "
The senate subsequently voted to dismiss the Prime Minister and the President was forced to announce a 15 % drop in the cost of rice , the staple food .
In April , Fanmi Lavalas was banned from standing in the elections resulting in a boycott by most of the population with a turnout only in the region of 8 % .
In August , when Rene Preval refused to sign a minimum wages law for the clothing export sector , police used tear gas to disperse a demonstration of 2,000 textile workers .
Preval said the workers should only receive 3 dollars a day ; a UN report released ahead of the parliamentary vote had threatened that while clothing exports to the US could create hundreds of thousands of jobs " factories ' overhead costs must be kept low . "
Imperialism 's Humanitarian Mask
This is the actual record of foreign intervention in Haiti , an intervention that is once more escalating in the wake of the earthquake .
In the modern world , imperialism almost always wears a humanitarian mask , we are told the 10,000 US Infantry now being deployed in Haiti are there to help the people despite the M4 rifles they carry , their authorization to use lethal force and the long and bloody history of the US Military in Haiti .
Very quickly after the earthquake the US Heritage Foundation advocated taking advantage of the earthquake to impose neoliberal restructuring on the people of Haiti , putting a statement on their website that argued that , " the U.S. response to the tragic earthquake in Haiti earthquake offers opportunities to re-shape Haiti ’s long - dysfunctional government and economy . "
This was only up for a couple of hours before someone realised it was perhaps a little too honest and it was removed , however it had already been copied and has been put into widespread circulation by Naomi Klein among others .
Klein's book ,
The Shock Doctrine , looks at how capitalism uses crises to impose restructuring on people that would otherwise resist .
In recent years the mass of the people of Haiti have suffered greatly under occupation - imposed restructuring programs .
Of course , as usual , there is also that narrow ruling layer that have done well out of acting as local agents for the occupation , or which have been able to use the occupation forces to suppress protest at the poor pay and conditions they offer to those who work from them and rent from them .
Historically , as we have seen , the interests of early capitalism saw the original inhabitants worked to death for the gold that fueled the expansion of European capitalism and then saw millions of Africans enslaved for the sugar plantations that enabled the young capitalist system to expand .
It will be a tragedy if the huge social needs created by this earthquake are allowed to once more create the conditions under which future generations of Haitians are enslaved by poverty and desperation .
A week after the earthquake it is becoming clear that this is what is in process .
On Thursday the IMF announced a further $ 100 million loan , pushing Haiti 's debt to the IMF to $ 265 million .
By 2003 Haiti's debt service was already approaching 150 % of the amount being spent on education , health care and other services .
The previous IMF loan was conditional on Haiti raising prices for electricity and refusing pay increases to all public employees except for those on the minimum wage , and although the strings attached to the latest loan are not yet visible , the history of IMF policies , in Haiti and around the world , in utilising loans as a tool for the implementation of neoliberal policies .
The people of Haiti made an enormous contribution to the struggle for freedom when they rose up and overthrew slavery in the 1790's .
But as we have seen the history of imperialist powers imposing economic and social policy did not end then , it carried on to the present day when it appears the earthquake will be the ' opportunity ' to force the survivors to accept what they would otherwise have resisted .
A popular Haitian proverb says ' Tanbou prete pa janm fè bon dans ' or ' A borrowed drum never makes good dancing ' illustrating a general awareness of what the role of outside intervention has really been and if imperialist intervention did not end in the 1790's nor did the resistance of the people of Haiti to that intervention , that also carries on to the present day .
Solidarity with the people of Haiti does not start and end with this tragic earthquake but must extend to the struggles they will fight in its aftermath against the ' disaster capitalism ' that is now being imposed .

ANAHEIM , Calif . --
When Nicklas Lidstrom was in the midst of the second - longest goal - scoring drought of his career and was n't producing as much offense as he usually does , the Detroit Red Wings were not concerned .
They anticipated a familiar pattern unfolding .
" Every year I 've been here , Nick has been better in the second half of the season , " Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
The Red Wings again are seeing Lidstrom 's production increase in the second half .
He has five goals and 19 points in his past 20 games , after collecting only one goal and 13 points in his first 37 games .
Babcock attributed the surge to the return of injured players such as Henrik Zetterberg , Valtteri Filppula and Dan Cleary .
" When you 're a D - man and you 're used to scoring and a lot of your points come on the power play and you do n't have ( as many ) players to play with up front in the first 30 or 40 games and people are asking why you 're not scoring , he 's probably thinking to himself , ' Is n't it kind of obvious why I 'm not scoring ? ' " Babcock said .
" I think he 's settled in and is playing well . "
Lidstrom turns 40 on April 28 , but it 's premature to cite age as the cause for his low early season output , which included a 42 - game stretch without a goal .
" The one thing with Swede ( Lidstrom ) , you know what you 're going to get night in and night out .
He consistently plays at a high level , " teammate Kris Draper said .
" Everyone in this dressing room , when he does n't score , we know exactly what he did that night , how great he was .
He 's just going to keep shooting and get opportunities .
" You figured once he got that one he was going to go on a roll .
Hopefully , he gets hot and keeps shooting and pucks go in for him . "
Lidstrom has been bothered by tendinitis in his right elbow the past couple years , but said that is n't the reason he was n't shooting as much earlier in the season .
" When the puck was n't going in for me , I continued to shoot , try to get shots on the net , " Lidstrom said .
" One goes in , and all the sudden , it seems to be coming in bundles .
I just have to continue to shoot the puck and try to jump up at the right moment . "
The Red Wings wrap up a four - game road trip Saturday afternoon at Los Angeles .
Lidstrom has no points in the past three games , but his surge has moved him up to 12th in the NHL in points among defensemen .
He has a reasonable chance to finish in the top 10 again .
" The great ones have another gear to go to that the rest of the players don't , " Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said .
" The first half of the year , everybody was writing and talking about where his game is at , but he 's always been air - tight defensively .
Part of the reason that he was n't getting as many points was that we 're not scoring as much as a team . "
Offense only is one part of Lidstrom 's game .
Even when he was n't scoring as much , he still was strong defensively .
He has a plus - 18 rating on a team that has allowed 13 more even - strength goals than it has scored .
That is the seventh - best plus - minus rating in the league for a defenseman .
" He 's just one of those guys , whatever his minutes are , you look back and he has the same demeanor , " Draper said .
" It 's amazing how he carries himself .
Now , he knows we 're in a big push .
Every night , he 's going to see the other team 's best line .
He continues to do a great job for this hockey club . "

Washington
Maybe you feel a twinge of guilt about having missed President Obama ’s health care forum on Thursday .
Maybe you wonder if you should have called in sick , stocked up on popcorn , printed out a few Congressional Budget Office reports and tuned in for six hours to do your civic duty .
Let me put your mind at ease .
Not since Sarah Palin ’s ill - starred interview with Katie Couric has a political event so perfectly anticipated a “ Saturday Night Live ” satire .
The president himself set the tone of self - parody .
Some of Mr. Obama ’s critics have suggested that he can be a wee bit pedantic , a touch too professorial .
Now they have six hours of videotape to back them up .
For the president , this was less a conversation than a seminar :
He lectured and interrupted ( “ Let me just finish , Lamar ” ) , started debates and then cut them off , ruled his opponents ’ arguments out of order and always gave himself the final word .
His Republican opponents , meanwhile , were out to disprove the notion that they have no ideas on health care reform .
Not so , America , not so !
They have two ideas , malpractice reform and interstate purchasing , which they clung to all day like Al Gore with his lockbox .
Also , they had several piled - high copies of the lengthy Senate health care bill , and a slogan to go with them : “ Let ’s start over from a clean sheet of paper . ”
What would end up on that paper ?
Why , malpractice reform and interstate purchasing , of course !
a . Find a _good_ genetic engineer .
b. Splice appropriate genes from electric eels into hamsters , because they 're smaller and cuter and , well , hamsters .
c. Feed the hamsters .
d. Surgically install appropriate electrodes .
e. Periodically drain off the voltage .
P.S. How could I have been so blind ?
Splice in genes from blue - green algae as well , and you would n't even have to feed the hamsters !
( Well , maybe some phosphorous and iron and stuff )
Google 's decision on Tuesday to risk walking away from the world 's largest Internet market may have come as a shock , but security experts see it as the most public admission of a top IT problem for U.S. companies : ongoing corporate espionage originating from China .
It 's a problem that the U.S. lawmakers have complained about loudly .
In the corporate world , online attacks that appear to come from China have been an ongoing problem for years , but big companies have n't said much about this , eager to remain in the good graces of the world 's powerhouse economy .
Google , by implying that Beijing had sponsored the attack , has placed itself in the center of an international controversy , exposing what appears to be a state - sponsored corporate espionage campaign that compromised more than 30 technology , financial and media companies , most of them global Fortune 500 enterprises .
The U.S. government is taking the attack seriously .
Late Tuesday , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released a statement asking the Chinese government to explain itself , saying that Google 's allegations " raise very serious concerns and questions . "
" The ability to operate with confidence in cyberspace is critical in a modern society and economy , " she said .
The search - engine company first learned it had a security problem in mid-December , coincidentally just days after hosting a closed - door symposium on circumventing censorship .
Soon the company 's security team realised that it was dealing with more than just a few hacked workstations .
" First , this attack was not just on Google .
As part of our investigation we have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range of businesses - including the Internet , finance , technology , media and chemical sectors - have been similarly targeted , " wrote Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond in a Tuesday blog posting .
" Second , we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists . "
Drummond said that the hackers never got into Gmail accounts via the Google hack , but they did manage to get some " account information ( such as the date the account was created ) and subject line . "
That 's because they apparently were able to access a system used to help Google comply with search warrants by providing data on Google users , said a source familiar with the situation , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press .
" Right before Christmas , it was , ' Holy s*** , this malware is accessing the internal intercept [ systems ] , ' " he said .
That , in turn led to a Christmas Eve meeting led by Google co-founder Larry Page to assess the situation .
Three weeks later , the company had decided that things were serious enough that it would risk walking away from the largest market of Internet users in the world .
Drummond , in his blog post , said that -- in part due to this incident -- Google would no longer censor search results in China , a move that could cause its
Web site to be blocked by the Chinese government .

Corporate IT workers have come to expect all sorts of Internet attacks from China in recent years , but because of the distributed nature of the Internet , it 's very hard to determine the true source of a cyber attack .
For several hundred dollars , criminals from any country can buy so - called bulletproof hosting in China .
These servers are guaranteed not to be taken down , even if they are linked to spam or other illegal online activity .
In this case , however , Google believes the attacks really were state sponsored , said Leslie Harris , president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology .
" They would n't be taking an action suggesting that they cannot operate in China ... if it was not related to the Chinese government , " she said .
Google 's security team eventually managed to gain access to a server that was used to control the hacked systems , and discovered that it was not the only company to be hit .
In fact , 33 other companies had also been compromised , including Adobe Systems , according to several sources familiar with the situation .

Being dismissed as a bunch of mentally challenged racists is why this movement is going to succeed .
You 'll hear our response in the voting booth .
We do need competence tests for every federal representative .
Think about it --- we require hair - dressers , insurance agents , doctors , lawyers , electricians etc ... to pass competence tests in this country , but the people who vote on legislation that affects our future are not required to demonstrate any competence at all .
We should have something akin to the bar exam for every candidate , before they are allowed to even run for office .

I never failed anyone who did n't earn it .
It 's important to separate the " teacher " part of the system , which is generally pretty competent , from the " admnistrative /bureaucratic " part of the system ( i.e. my bosses ) , which is pretty incompetent .
( Which , by the way , is why a lot of them go into administration to begin with - they are not competent in the classroom . )
The education system has / is failing in many respects ... but not because of the teachers .
I know it was a joke , but we a fairly maligned profession , us teachers , when in all fairness we do the best we can with what we have to work with .

Furthermore I think what really fails our country ( and people like the teabaggers in general ) is a lack of respect for actually being educated .
Educated people are somehow " elitist " ?
For being educated ?
I do n't get it ( I 'm uneducated in the psychology of being uneducated ! )
And the truth is ( to continue my above point about the difference between administration and teaching ) that being educated as a teacher is seen as something to be ' managed ' by administration , because they do n't want us to ' put off ' parents by being too smart , coming across as arrogant , pompous , know - it - all ( does that sound familiar ?
Why , it 's just exactly why teabaggers do n't like us liberals - we think we know too much ! )
I 'll share a very recent example , something I got in " trouble " for just a couple of days ago : I somehow got on a bulk email list originating with a parent of one of my students , and I received this ( as did a number of my colleagues ) :
Keep the prayer going please .
Lord , I just want to say THANK YOU , because this morning I woke up and knew where my children were .
Because this morning my home was still standing , because this morning I am not crying because my husband , my child , my brother or sister needs to be buried out from underneath a pile of concrete , because this morning I was able to drink a glass of water , because this morning I was able to turn on the light , because this morning I was able to take a shower , because this morning I was not planning a funeral , but most of all I thank you this morning because I still have life and a voice to cry out for the people of Haiti .
Lord I cry out to you , the one that makes the impossible , possible , the one that turns darkness in to light , I cry out that you give those mothers strength , that you give them peace that surpasses all understanding , that you may open the streets so that help can come , that you may provide doctors , nurses , food , water , and all that they need in a blink of an eye .
For all those that have lost family members , give them peace , give them hope , give them courage to continue to go on !
Protect the children and shield them with your power .
I pray all this in the name of Jesus !!!
To all my friends please continue to forward this so that we can pray together for the people in Haiti .
We here are truly blessed !!!!!
So I responded , en masse ...
While I understand the sentiment of this note to the people of Haiti who are in dire circumstances , praying to Jesus or any other mythical entities will not resolve their issues .
An honest study of Haitian history will reveal that Western colonialism is a big part of the reason that Haiti remains to this day the poorest nation in the hemisphere , and institutions like the World Bank and the IMF keep countries like Haiti in a position of Economic Slavery .
If you are really interested in understanding the plight of countries like Haiti , read Confessions of an Economic Hit Man by John Perkins
A People 's History of the United States by Howard Zinn
and read journalist Greg Palast 's blog at www.gregpalast.com
The earthquake that devastated Haiti was nobody 's fault but Mother Nature .
The aftermath is a disaster decades in the making .
**PS I 'm sure you did n't expect a response like this , but it is one of the hazards of sending bulk emails .
I would suggest in the future that you Bcc all of the recipients in mailings like this , or you are apt to get a similar response , at least from me .
Cheers !
I got reprimanded not for being right , or educated , or trying to enlighten people a little ... but for being challenging , for making people feel badly , for causing tension between the school and the community .
Here 's your sign ...

wow...um... so... you do realize Tancredo was n't talking about " competence tests " for office holders , right ?
( the irony filling the gaps here being unbeleivably palpable )
And you do realize that what he was calling for is contradictory , on almost every level , to the populist constitutionalism that the tea baggers have bee conned into beleiving they beleive in , right ?
Without a condemnation for Tancredo's remarks , I 'll have to presume you do n't understand any of that , beleive he was referring to " competence tests " for office holders , and thus somewhat underscore his actual ( incredibly offensive ) point in one of the most ironic ( and sad ) ways .

Like you kick over a decaying log in the woods and see a white wiggling mass of goo .
Pity that there are legit concerns they express however , the whiff of unexpunged hate and bigotry keeps them from gaining more than a protest vote .
Better for all concerned to just pack up the teabagging lot , move to Idaho , and secede from the US .

Tea Bagger Brook @ 10 tried to backtrack with : I was referring to post # 4 re : competence tests --- which we need to implement .
Right .
Except post # 4 did not refer to " competence tests " either .
It referred , satirically , to " literacy tests " , the same offensive practice that Tea Bag Tancredo offensively opened the Tea Bagger convention yearning for .
( And , to # 4 's point , though it should go without saying , " literacy tests " , such as they were done in the Jim Crowe era , certainly would * not * have kept GWBush from coming close enough that the SCOTUS could give him the election , even though he got fewer votes --- both nationally and in FL --- than Al Gore .
If anything , such " laws " would have given Bush a huge margin of victory , since so many minorities would have been kept from voting , as those " laws " were meant to accomplish .
If actual literacy tests were given , since self - identified Republicans have been shown time and again to be far less informed than self - identified Dems , of course , most Dubya voters could n't have cast a ballot at all .
Just as # 4 asserts . )
Tancredo's point was that the voter registration process is out of control in many states , which is why there are lawsuits flying around .
The Constitution does not give non-citizens the right to vote .
No .
That was not Tancredo's point by a long shot .
And no , there are not " non-citizens " voting , despite what you democracy - hating , Constitution - loathing , conspiracy theory whacko Republicans - pretending - to - be- independents enjoy pretending .
That , of course , is backed up by George W. Bush 's own DoJ who put more resources into prosecuting mythical " voter fraud " than any DoJ in the history of this nation .
( Here 's a bit of help for you on that point . )
I could give u many more links , hundreds if not thousands of them , from this blog , and mountains of peer reviewed evidence all over the place .
But it 's likely easier for you to come here and play out your misinformed / disinformed fantasies instead of actually trying to educate yourself about actual facts since you are a very helpful stooge for the partisans who are playing you for a sucker on ALL of these points .
Other than that , Tea Bag On , Brook !

Tancredo is deluding himself if he thinks that he can tap that bitter tea to get back the reigns of power .
Demographics are against them .

By way of demonstrating how unbelievably disinformed and / or delusional you are , this is from last week 's NYTimes : A key Senate Republican came out swinging today against the idea of passing just an energy bill and ignoring President Obama 's call to also cap greenhouse gas emissions .
" It 's the ' kick the can down the road ' approach , " said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina .
" It 's putting off to another Congress what really needs to be done comprehensively .
I do n't think you 'll ever have energy independence the way I want until you start dealing with carbon pollution and pricing carbon .

I 've seen the Teabaggers first hand .
They are mostly racist , even if they 're not holding a racist sign .
All you have to do is let them talk for 5 minutes after you mention Obama .
Most of them are against educating children .
That goes back to that old Libertarian thing of no government agencies that are n't in the original Constitution .
Of course , they did n't take the thought process to the next level .
While screaming for Charter or home schools ( meaning , religious schools get federal money , and selective education - no talk of evolution ) they forgot that it 's those pesky public schools that educate most of us who could n't afford to pay for private school .
And vouchers for charter schools are not the whole tuition , they 're merely vouchers for a portion .
Therefore , it would be the ones who could already afford private school getting the vouchers and a discount paid for by the Federal government .
This movement wants to take money away from public schools and still wants a literacy test , meaning , if you 're not the elite , you do n't get an education if they have their way .
It 's not just those of color they do n't want to vote , it 's also the people who are n't well off .
Which is most or us .
And would include the Tea baggers .

Was going to let that comment stand on its own , but if you want my feedback ... Your analogy is totally off - base .
Now , if " we " as a group , say " The BRAD BLOG National Convention " invited Obama to be a speaker , the opening speaker , and he gave a war mongering speech , and we all applauded him loudly , asked no questions about it , did n't denounce it , etc. , then yes , it would be appropriate to suggest " The BRAD BLOG Nation " were war mongerers .
Simply suggesting , however , that because we live in a country where the President has war mongering policies that somehow * I * am a war mongerer is ridiculous .
I suppose if I applauded those policies , voted for him , promoted them appreciatively , etc. you could make that argument .
But I have not done so , have been critical of those policies , as ( I think ) have you .
So why would I or you be tarred by what he says ?
Your comparison is nothing like what happened last week in Nashville , and I 've still yet to see a single tea bagger denounce Tancredo or his comments .

Either support your continuously inaccurate allegations , take 'em elsewhere .
The bullshit is getting real tiresome , and I 've got better things to do than to continually correct your endless misinformation .

No .
They are not .
So , again , unless you can support your argument with evidence , knock it off , move along , or I 'll be forced to presume you 're purposely posting disinformation here .
The argument was that folks like YOU have suddenly become concerned about government spending now that there is a Democratic President , when you did n't give a damn about it for the previous 8 years , allowing your Big Government " President " to grow the government to an historically unprecedented size .
As to spending * now* , if you 're not in favor of it , you have n't a clue about either economics or history .
Go educate yourself .
And not at Fox " News " , k ?
Because they have played you for a stooge .
Conservatives were sounding the alarm about spending during the Bush years along with the Blue Dogs .
Really ?
Who ?
The only one who I know of who did that , the only * real * conservative Republican in Congress , was Ron Paul , and you people marginalized him , called him names , said he was crazy , from Mars , shut him out out Republican debates , and everything else in the world .
Beyond him , I 'm unaware of any actual conservatives in Congress in the Republican Party .
Are you down with using TARP repayments for further expansion of government rather than paying down the deficit , which is exactly what is going on ?
Do n't know who " you guys " is .
We do n't think in lockstep around here ( perhaps you 're thinking of a different type of group ? )
But as far as I 'm concerned , yes , now is not the time to start " paying down the deficit " given the state of the economy .
And , as I said , if you do n't understand why , you 've got no clue about either economics or history .

" Middle class Americans are looking for solutions , folks . "
The only factual thing you said , and -- surprise -- the only one that is n't a senseless , spit - up partisan squawking point .
" They 're not impressed by the intellectual hubris of liberals .
. . . " Sorry , who are you to speak on behalf of middle - class Americans ?
I still do n't think I 've heard .
More importantly , if any large segment of middle - class Americans honestly believes that liberals ' intellectualism is to blame for our present economic riptide , it only speaks to that segment 's own gullibility and willful ignorance , and to the press 's ongoing failure to distinguish itself from a propaganda machine .
" . . . which is why the wisdom of cutting the size , scope , and authority of the federal government is gaining traction . "
Oh !
So you 're only interested in paring down the federal ficus when there are liberals in charge .
You really do have a good reason for having stood idly by while never - blush Bush sold more of this country 's future to China than every previous president combined , while creating layer after layer of federal extra-structure .
Conservatives can spend all they want , so long as they 're not liberals .
I 'm amazed the cognitive dissonance has n't caused your head to implode yet .
Honestly , Brook , I 've tried to talk to you as a human being , but you seem to have no interest in being anything more than a mockingbird .
I 'm starting to agree with Brad 's assessment , as post by post you look more like some sort of self - styled agent provocateur .
It 's like you 're arcing haphazardly from lightning rod to lightning rod expecting to somehow burn down the house .
You 've made it pretty clear you 're not here to discuss anything .

Soul , what we know is that politicians take more money out of our pocket than any corporation .
I 've already pointed out it 's 50 % for middle class folks .
Half my cell bill is tax , for example .
Add it up , my friends .
In exchange for this we 've got states , municipalities , and a federal government drowning in debt .
Instead of dealing with this 4 alarm fire going off around the country , Congress is fighting climate change and trying to pass a health bill that even liberals have denounced .
Anyone want to keep preaching the wisdom of Democrats ?
The McCain's , Grahams , Hatch 's and every other GOP shill for the globalist New World Order have to go , but so do the Leahy 's , Kerry's , and Feinsteins .
McCain is first , and we 've got a good shot at removing him .
Would that the progressives would wake up and do the same in their party .

less than 50 grand of earnings and the corp tax is 15 % , is that too high in your opionion ?
we shouldnt lump all corps into one evil entity any more than baggers should lump all librals into 1 evil entity , , , state laws have forced most small business peops into forming corps , this is basically for the benefit of insurance companies , in illinois an indiviual working by himself must supply a workmans comp certificate , THAT COVERS NO ONE at a grand a yr brook , how do you feel about re enstating the death tax ?

in·tel·lec·tu·al | adj .
1. a. of or relating to the intellect ; b. rational rather than emotional .
2. appealing to or engaging the intellect : an intellectual book ; an intellectual problem .
3. a. having or showing intellect , especially to a high degree [ see Synonyms at intelligent ] ; b. given to activities or pursuits that require exercise of the intellect .
noun
a person possessing a highly developed intellect .
So when a Tea Party minded or anti-intellectual soul uses the term ' intellectual ' as a putdown ...
Thank that person and continue to school said anti-intellectual ....
I mean come on ... Thomas Paine , Thomas Jefferson , Ben Franklin and Adam Smith were intellectuals .
Facist minded Tea partiers and right wingers hate intellectualism because intellectuals expose the irrationality of their ideas .

Blue Hawk and Karen get to the crux of the problem .
First , the Federal Reserve has created a debt virus that can never be repaid .
Every dollar printed with debt attached requires another dollar printed to pay the interest --- with debt attached .
Second , cutting the corporate tax is a far more effective means of dealing with this crisis , because every sector of the economy will benefit .
Obama 's stimulus is going to pick and choose who gets a boost , and it will most certainly go to corporations and union shops that support the party in power .
( Like GE )
If the stimulus does n't work after we 've spent all these billions , what will Obama do for a second act ?
I argue cutting the corporate tax will not only boost employment but pass savings onto consumers , lowering prices in the highly competitive food and retail industries .
This will help the people struggling the most to make ends meet .
The bottom line is funding government with taxes and debt interest banking is a 20th Century model that is obsolete and new solutions must be found .

Oh , and please call me Brad .
This from AP : Bush quietly signs corporate tax - cut bill
$ 136 billion measure assailed for catering to special interests ASSOCIATED PRESS - updated 1:44 p.m. PT , Fri. , Oct .
22 , 2004 WASHINGTON - With no fanfare , President Bush Friday signed the most sweeping rewrite of corporate tax law in nearly two decades , showering $ 136 billion in new tax breaks on businesses , farmers and other groups .
Intended to end a bitter trade war with Europe , the election - year measure was described by supporters as critically necessary to aid beleaguered manufacturers who have suffered 2.7 million lost jobs over the past four years .
But opponents charged that the tax package had grown into a massive giveaway that will add to the complexity of the tax system and end up rewarding multinational companies that move jobs overseas .
There was no ceremony for the bill - signing .
... “ I signed a bill that ’s going to help our manufacturers — that will save $ 77 billion over the next 10 years for the manufacturing sector of America , ” Bush said .
“ That will help keep jobs here . ”
[ How'd that work out for ya ? - Brad ]
The measure is the most sweeping overhaul of corporate tax law since 1986 .
I 've tried to suggest to you , again and again , that you 've been played for a stooge by the propagandists you 've been following , rather than actual news .
But if you refuse to pay attention , and wish to keep playing the fool , that 'll be up to you and your duped tea bagging friends , of course .

What Thomas Jefferson REALLY meant when he championed for a " small government "
When Jefferson railed against government , he had in mind the predatory tyrannies of old Europe .
" Under pretence of governing , " he wrote , " they have divided their nations into two classes , wolves and sheep . "
He did n't want the American government to become another pack of wolves , or an enabler of wolves .
He opposed exploitation of the governed by any form of power --- government or corporate .
Jefferson 's enmity to European - style oppression was equal to his enmity to Alexander Hamilton , the conservative movement 's true hero and champion of centralized power in the service of business .
What Jefferson wanted , in historian Daniel Boorstin 's words , was " a government too weak to aid the wolves , and yet strong enough to protect the sheep . "

More from the article @ 69
It 's that benevolence that today 's tea-stained reactionaries call " big government . "
Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security , among the largest segments of government spending , are n't instruments of government power .
They 're means of insuring health and a measure of dignity in old age .
Reactionaries want those " reformed , " with debt --- never their concern for 30 years --- as their smokescreen .
The $ 44 billion Department of Homeland Security , the $ 700 billion Department of Defense , the $ 50 billion complex of 16 spy agencies , and the colossus of federal and state police and prison forces --- those are instruments of classic and often abusive government power , not to mention debt .
Yet , those are the sacred cows , or wolves , of the conservative theology that wants to " take back our country . "
The slogan is the " tea party " movement 's favorite , although " movement " is a misnomer .
It 's an everything - but - kitchen - sink convergence of an overwhelmingly white , resentful , evangelical populism with denialists of all sorts ( vaccines , global warming , swine flu ) , tax abolitionists , " birthers " ( Obama is a Manchurian Muslim implant from Kenya ) , anti-immigrants , militia - type survivalists , neo-Confederates and garden - variety racists who can't stomach a " negro " as their president .
Deride these gun shows on speed at your own risk :
They 're resetting the political agenda .

The corporate tax of 15 % would be a flat tax --- no exceptions , no deductions , no tax breaks .
everybody pays the same rate , so that is fair .
the rate would be low enough that the googles and mcd 's would find it less expensive just to pay the tax rather than an army of lobbyists and lawyers trying to find tax loopholes .
McCain 's tax is voluntary , meaning you can still take the 1040 standard deduction if you want to or opt for the flat tax --- whichever works best for you .
None of these ideas will be implemented .
We 've got a President hell - bent on " spending our way " out of this recession , driving us headlong into national default .

As you 've pointed out , the poorest sectors already do n't pay any federal income tax at all .
it 's hard to give them any more relief on taxes .
Getting control of our fiscal situation is essential for the survival of all the services provided by the government .
the current situation is unsustainable .
We cannot afford any new federal programs .
We need to be cutting the federal workforce by at least 5 % and slashing budgets in every department , including the military .
The lil guys will be hurt the most , if we turn into Greece .
The tea party is also actively engaged in killing cap and trade , which will raise the utility rates you pay for gas and electricity .

COMMENT # 80 [ Permalink ]
... DES said on 2/13/2010 @ 3:58 pm PT ...
Brook , surely you 're aware that laying off more people , as you advocate , directly results in further depressing tax revenue that pays for all government services , including the really important ones , at the local , state and federal level .
Very simply put , the economic data shows that in a severe economic downturn , the federal government injects liquidity into the system , it keeps the economic system by becoming the buyer of last resort .
You also asked : " Are you suggesting the federal government should not follow this common sense approach the states are taking ?
Have we ever tried cutting the corporate tax rate to stimulate the economy in the past ? "
Yes , it 's been tried , and the data shows that tax cuts do not lead to job creation .
For example ,
There was zero net job creation in the 2000s , even after the Bush Administration pushed through two historic tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans .
Not only did tax cuts for the wealthy mean that the vast majority of Americans were paying a higher percentage of their income than the rich for the costs of running a stable society , the tax cuts also greatly reduce revenues , leading directly to the current deficit due to the cost of two wars in the Middle East .
The wealthiest Americans --- those who own the means of production --- took their gains and speculated in the stock market instead of creating jobs .
No jobs means no tax revenue means deficits means cuts in the most basic services .
California passed the largest corporate tax cut in state history , yet the state 's unemployment rate remains among the highest in the nation .
That corporate tax cut not only has not led to new jobs creation , it severely reduced revenues that have led to layoffs in all sectors , in both local governments and every business that does business with state and local governments , further depressing revenues from corporate and individual taxes .
It is very basic Econ 101 that the circulation of money keeps everyone going , not just those ' bloated government ' .
Again , the economic data shows the 2000s were a " lost decade " for the U.S. economy , the evidence directly refuting , in this case , that the Bush tax cuts in any way boosted the economy .
The tax cuts boosted the economy for a short time , but only temporarily , only for the wealthiest families , as the middle class showed declining wages .
The boom was unsustainable and in the end we have no lasting assets , a crumbling infrastructure , the stock market is right back where it was in 2000 --- but now we have widespread unemployment and the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression .
The links above are just two small examples of it , but the mountains of evidence show that tax cuts do not drive job creation .

Brook - I ( and others ) have repeatedly shown you where you were completely wrong on talking point after talking point .
Instead of admit you were wrong and / or disinformed , you simply keep trying to move the goalposts to new , equally wrong and / or equally disinformed assertions .
Your latest suggestion for a flat tax ( both income and corporate ) will * raise * , not lower , the taxes for both the folks at the bottom of the ladder , and the corporations at the top .
I 'm glad you are among the few who might get a tax break with your plan , but the rest of the folks you hope to help or suggest fuel the economy with jobs , will not .
Furthermore , as Des alluded above , cutting government spending during a recession is a proven disaster .
To suggest , as you did , that " We can not afford any new federal programs .
We need to be cutting the federal workforce by at least 5 % and slashing budgets in every department , including the military " suggests you have absolutely no education about economics or modern American history .
It was FDR 's government spending and employment programs ( CCC , WPA , etc. ) that got the economy back on track during the Great Depression , along with greatly increased government * regulation * ( not de-regulation ! ) of banks , etc .
When he cut back on gov spending a few years later , the economy began to downslide again , until WWII led to increased gov spending again which eventually helped to revive / save the economy .

The tea party is also actively engaged in killing cap and trade , which will raise the utility rates you pay for gas and electricity .
Again , this hurts the poorest sectors the most .
Another swing , another miss .
I 'll let Desi respond to this specifically , but in short , while rates will go up an avg . of $ 175 or so per household , the various breaks and subsidies for those who can least afford that increase , along with the jobs programs that go with it all , are said to more than make up for the hit you claim the " poorest sectors " would see .
Again , I 'd like to think that not everyone is as disinformed as you in the Tea Party movement , but I now doubt .
Especially given yesteday 's poll showing that just 2 % of self - identified baggers know that they received a federal tax * cut * last year , while 45 % of them actually think their federal taxes were * raised * .
There ya go .
Now feel free to create new goal posts rather than just admitting you were wrong , and then wrong , and then wrong , and then wrong again .

Well Mr. Friedman , you 've accused me of being wrong before , and i was forced to embarrass you with evidence to the contrary .
We would n't want that to happen again , would we ?
Cap and trade is clearly another attempt by the New World Order central banking cabal to get the world 's first global tax in place under the guise of a global carbon credit exchange .
This , of course , will be firmly under their control , and they will skim billions off the top , before 3rd world nations see a dime of it .
How is it that a busy entrepreneur knows this and the investigative reporter on this blog does n't ?
Please folks , learn the difference between personal tax cuts and corporate tax cuts , before you post .
Des 's example of a corporate tax cut in CA wo n't even take effect until 2011 .
Progressives have run the state of CA in the ground , and their unsustainable welfare / pension obligations will require a massive federal bailout .
Really , the burden of proof is on progressives to prove that Obama 's top down stimulus approach is a better plan than cutting the corporate tax rate .
We handed him $ 850 billion last year , and we 've got very little to show for it .

BlueHawk , which ideas are you talking about ?
State governments around this country are slashing budgets and laying off employees --- basically down - sizing government due to reduced tax revenues .
They do n't have a license to print money .
Are you suggesting the federal government should not follow this common sense approach the states are taking ?
Have we ever tried cutting the corporate tax rate to stimulate the economy in the past ?
I 'll take your last sentence first ...
Yes W Bush did it in the mid-2000s ; it led to the greatest economic meltdown since the great depression and grew government debt like never before ...
Cutting corporate taxes only stimulates board room bonuses and off shore investment ; hardly a job making engine for America .
State revenues are down because unemployment is well over 10 % and businesses are doing less business because the unemployed DON'T SPEND , American companies can't compete with goods being made in China , Taiwan and the Phillipines by American companies that W Bush gave tax breaks to enable them to move overseas .
That impacts State revenues ... both for personal income taxes and business income taxes .
Chinese goods carry a 2 % tariff in America , while American goods carries a 20 % tariff in China .
That is a major reason for the economic meltdow. , Overseas markets are closed to American goods ... while overseas goods have full access to American markets .
What you 're ignorantly proposing will only deepen the economic crisis ... laying off more government workers in order to alleviate unemployment and stimulate the economy ?
In what topsy - turvy universe does that make sense ?
Your ideas are a highway to abolishing the middle class and turning the United States into a society where 5 % of the population owns all the wealth and resourses .... hell we 're basically there now .
Your ideas will only further those ends .
In your society the population is little more that chattel slaves who will cut each other 's throats for a minimum wage job ... while the rich live in luxury in the gated castle security compounds .
Yours is a corporate fascist state .
I think Karen asked you earlier ... just what ideas do you have that will relieve the pain or the common man .
All you 're proposing is further goodies for those that are the cause of the current economic mess .
And you have n't cited one credible source for your assertions ... if you read back everyone responding to your comments have cited numerous credible sources for their conclusions .
You have n't .

How is it that a busy entrepreneur knows this and the investigative reporter on this blog does n't ?
Because the busy ( pseudonymous ) entrepreneur can say anything they want , pull any inaccurate talking point or whacked out conspiracy theory out of their ass , with no evidence to support even a piece of it , while the investigative reporting on this blog actually has be able to support what he reports with stuff like facts and independently verifiable evidence .
Really , the burden of proof is on progressives to prove that Obama 's top down stimulus approach is a better plan than cutting the corporate tax rate .
That 's already been proven .
Your corporate tax cuts , largest in a generation during the Bush era succeeded in ensuring that middle - class incomes stayed flat or declined , while corporations made record profits and helped push the economy over a cliff in the bargain .
Your Republican plan failed .
Dressing it up in tea baggers clothing does n't make it anymore of a successful economy policy than it was the previous time it failed ( only to rely on the government to bail it out , of course , as folks like you seem to believe in privatizing profits and socializing losses and failure . )
We handed him $ 850 billion last year , and we 've got very little to show for it .
For a start , as you 've been shown here time and again , what we have to show for it is that he saved the economy ( for now ) from the brink of the irreperable failure that your failed heroes left for him .
Here 's just a few pieces of evidence for that .
Let 's hear it , folks .
Tell me why this is going to work better .
In the words of Tammy Wynette , stand by your man .
He ain't my man .
Did n't vote for him , not particularly impressed with him .
That said , compared to the unprecedented historical disasters that you tea baggers proved to be in office , I 'd take his shitty job over your complete and utter failure any day .
In a subsequent note , you 've managed to try to rationalize the fact that your faith - based economic policies managed to take an unprecedented surplus , turn it into an unmitigated defecit disaster when real wages stayed either flat or declined for the " little guy " you pretend to ( or have been conned into ) acting as if you give a damn about .
You continue to define epic fail with each new post , Brook .
Though I must admit , were it not for your American - hating folks being so damned dangerous to society as as a whole , it would otherwise be quite amusing seeing you twisting in the wind and yet coming back again with another helping of : " Please smack me again . "
But thanks for keeping us safe from the NWO and reality .

Brook @ #88 : Time and again people here have provided you with sourced links to help you learn some basic economics , but you ignore them and move on or make up some other canard or post completely unsourced , ideological BS that is easily disproved with a 30 - second Google search .
Here are some numbers for you , since you apparently missed them :
The Bush years were a " lost decade " for all but the top 1 % of Americans .
Reality puts the lie to the rightwing canard that tax cuts lead to job growth .
The Great Recession began in December 2007 , during the Bush Administration .
Reagan began the process of thirty years of systematic dismantling of the regulatory structure put in place after the Great Depression , and when Republicans got possession of all three branches of government , they finished the job , and everyone got to see exactly what comes from Republican economic policies : the global financial system was literally ( not figuratively ) on the brink of total collapse in September 2008 , during the Bush Administration .
In the midst of the crisis , Wall St. and the wealthiest 1 % banked enormous profits then walked away , socializing their losses onto you , removing from the economy all the money that would otherwise have gone into services and growth investment for you .
When the Republicans were in total power all those years , why did n't they give you a tax cut for your small business ?
Clinton handed Bush near - record low unemployment .
By the time Bush left , unemployment had doubled , and within one month of his leaving office , unemployment skyrocketed before any of Obama 's policies could be put into place .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau the country lost ground on all measurements during the Bush years , including negative wage growth and negative job growth for the middle class .
No matter how many different ways you try to massage the numbers , the economy historically does better for the middle class under Democratic administrations than under Republican ones .
All but one of the last seven recessions occurred during Republican administrations .
Biggest expansion of national debt ?
During Republican Administrations .
" The last three decades have seen a seen a momentous shift :
The rich became vastly richer while working - class wages stagnated .
Economists say 80 percent of net income gains since 1980 went to people in the top 1 percent of the income distribution , boosting their share of total income to levels unseen since before the Great Depression . "
Unless you 're in the top 1 % of income in America , Brook , when Republicans talk about tax cuts they 're not talking about you .
They never were talking about you .
You 're the only one here who is fooled by your revisionist history .
Which is so weird , because you consistently advocate for policies that are against your own best economic interests .
When you cut the economy down to the bone marrow today , you undermine your future and the future of American global competitiveness --- the source of all future tax revenues and our future economy .
Seriously , pick up an Econ 101 book .

COMMENT # 105 [ Permalink ]

Brook @ # 82 , most investigative reporters can tell the difference between actual news and paranoid ravings .
An evidence - free rant on cap - and - trade being part of the New World Order Secret Global Domination Plan ( oh noes !
hide !
they know you 're on to them ! ) is utter nuttery .
Was cap - and - trade a NWO conspiracy when George H.W. Bush implemented it ?
Industry said it would destroy the economy back then , too .
Then came the biggest economic expansion in U.S. history .
Even Reagan championed the difficult process of saving the ozone layer .
Like most self - absorbed rightwingers unable to see past their own perceived short - term self - interest , your cap - and - trade rant falls within the Rogue & Mavericky template .
Here are the real numbers : The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimates that the U.S. cap - and - trade program will cost $ 22 billion annually , or about $ 175 per household , by 2020 .
...
The CBO analysis estimates that the legislation will cost the richest U.S. households $ 245 a year , and the poorest will see gains of $ 40 a year .
FYI , the CBO clearly states their estimate does NOT include any of the expected cost benefits from the legislation , from reduced public health spending ( $ 120 billion a year from air pollution alone ) , reduced costs of military defense of our oil supply , or reduced costs for cleanup & mitigation from industrial activities and natural resources extraction , among others , which are currently borne by you the taxpayer .
The revenue from the cap - and - trade system will also reduce the deficit --- both the House and the Senate versions --- using the free market system , two things you claim you care about .
Putting a price on carbon pollution is a rational , market - based approach that has already been supported , successfully implemented by Republican presidents , and puts the cost of pollution and the market incentive where it belongs : on the polluters .
Apparently you 're one of a select few who want your tax dollars to be spent cleaning up industry pollution , who like dirty air and contaminated water .... @ 93 , well duh .
Of course Goldman Sachs would have part of any market - based system for carbon trading .
Who did you think would participate in it --- kittens ?
There is n't a market system in the world that operates without market participation by market players .
No actual changes in the market will ever occur without buy - in from market players themselves .
It 's proper regulation and oversight that makes the difference .
So I 'm curious --- did you support GS back when they were lobbying for deregulation of the financial system , the repeal of Glass - Steagall and the CFMA of 2000 , along with CDOs , CDSs , and AIG 's other nifty financial innovations ?
For the record , @ #97 , neither Brad nor any of the bloggers at The BRAD BLOG have stated one way or the other whether they " support cap - and - trade " legislation currently before Congress .
Readers here are perfectly capable of gathering info and analysis from multiple sources , and analyzing these extremely complex policy proposals for themselves .
We simply report the facts and ( non-idiotic ) analysis , and leave all the voodoo scare - mongering to rightwingers , who live in a fact - free world anyway .

Brook said : Des , in # 99 you said Bush was a lost decade ; now you 're saying he presided over the biggest expansion in history !
You are not only gullible , self - defeating loon , apparently you can't read either .
DES referred to George H.W. Bush who was followed in office by Democrat Bill Clinton who presided over the largest economic expansion in history , leaving a budget surplus behind until George W. Bush drove the entire economy over the cliff that you want to throw it over again with the same failed policies .
Dope .

" Personally I think Brook is enjoying the circular nature of his arguments . "
I do too , BlueHawk .
Even relishing the role .
So a good question for us might be how do we collectively address ( Brook 's ) terminal case of Super - Duh without allowing our discourse to get hijacked and sucked into Paranoid DumDumLand ?
Seriously .
We need a workaround and fast .
Thoughts are things .
And maintaining Brook 's basement - level , substandard crouch is bad positioning for all of our brains .
We 're not making Brook any smarter , he / she is making us dumber !
( And LOVING it ...)

From George Saunders " The Braindead Megaphone " : " Imagine a party .
The guests , from all walks of life are not negligible .
They 've been around : they 've lived , suffered , own businesses , have real areas of expertise .
They 're talking about things that interest them , giving and taking subtle correction .
Certain submerged concerns are coming to the surface and - surprise , pleasant surprise - being confirmed and seconded and assuaged by other people who 've been feeling the same way .
Then a guy walks in with a megaphone .
He 's not the smartest person at the party , or the most experienced , or the most articulate .
But he 's got a megaphone .
Say he starts talking about how much he loves early morning in spring .
What happens ?
Well , people turn to listen .
It would be hard not to .
It 's only polite .
And soon , in their small groups , the guest may find themselves talking about early spring mornings .
Or , more correctly , about the validity of Megaphone Guy 's idea 's about early spring mornings .
Some are agreeing with him , some disagreeing --- but because he 's so loud , their conversations will begin to react to what he 's saying .
As he changes topics , so do they ...
... His main characteristic is his dominance .
He crowds other voices out .
His rhetoric becomes the central rhetoric because of it's unavoidability .
In time , Megaphone Guy will ruin the party .
The guests will stop believing in their value as guests , and come to see their main role as reactors - to - the - Guy .
They 'll stop doing what guests are supposed to do : keep the conversation going per their own interests and concerns .
They 'll become passive , stop believing in the validity of their own impressions .
They may not even notice ... that their thoughts are being limned by his .
What 's important to him will come to seem important to them ... "

( cont'd ) " We 've said Megaphone Guy is n't the smartest , or most articulate ... but what if the situation is even worse than this ?
Let 's say he has n't carefully considered the things he 's saying .
He 's basically just blurting things out .
And even with the megaphone , he has to should a little to be heard , which limits the complexity of what he can say ... favoring the ... anxiety or controvery - provoking ( " Wine running out due to shadowy consipracy ? " ) or the gossipy , " Quickie rumored in south bathroom ! " ) and the trivial ( " Which quadrant of the party do YOU prefer ? " )
We consider speech to be the result of thought ( we have a thought , then select a sentence with which to express it ) , but thought also results from speech ( as we grope , in words , towards meaning , we discover what we think . )
This yammering guy has , by forcibly putting his restricted language into the heads of the guests , affected the quality and the coloration of the thoughts going on in there .
He has , in effect , put an intelligence - ceiling on the party .

Hawk , i know i'm winning a debate when one of two things happen .
1 . the other resorts to name - calling , because they have nothing else to offer up 2 . the other cannot or will not answer basic logical questions .
Jeanine , allow me to put a question to you .
Adding the business to the right and left of me , we employ about 30 people .
I 'm guessing a corporate tax cut will put 50 to 100 K a year back into our collective pockets .
That 's money we can use to give raises and / or hire new folks .
Yes , believe it or not , we want to give our people raises .
Obama 's stimulus is offering us absolutely nothing .
That money is going to go to union shops or swing states where Democrats are in trouble .
So , Jeanine , can you please answer the question this time .
Why is this trillion $ $$ stimulus plan better than a corporate tax cut to stimulate jobs across the board ?

Jeannie --- great excerpt on " Megaphone Guy " !
Also applies to the Breitbart / O'Keefe threads , and in the larger sense to all rightwing distraction media .
Brook may try to lower the I.Q. of the discourse with his transparent , constantly moving targets and circular " reasoning " ( being generous there ) but he has n't succeeded .
Everyone here has replied with cogent , sourced , evidenced - based arguments .
The only thing Brook has succeeded in doing is confirming the intellectual bankruptcy of his ideology , which does n't stand up to basic scrutiny .
He 's exposed his own hypocrisy , confirming his outrage only appears when Democrats are doing it .
Brook repeats the same arguments & " questions " over and over again , glossing over or completely ignoring the sourced , evidence - based answers he 's received .
Note he 's asking again about corporate tax cuts , demanding answers without answering any of the questions posed to him before .
IMHO it 's a useful exercise to roll through the evidence and the reasoning again , if one is in the mood for it .
Plus , I really enjoy your writing and troll - stomping acumen - and am always appreciative of the new evidence , new resources , and incisive new arguments that you guys bring !
( like the " megaphone guy " analogy )
Otherwise , unless you 're so inclined , simply do n't feed the trolls .
Ignore them and they 'll wander off sooner .

See ?
Lookee there , he did it again --- he must be ' winning the debate ' because he still believes everything he says !
Of course , most people would say part of ' winning ' any debate requires actually succeeding in shooting down opposing arguments , convincing the audience , or changing minds on at least one or two points .

No , Des , i'm winning the debate because none of you guys even know the difference between personal tax cuts and corporate tax cuts .
Yes ,
Hawk , i find you guys very amusing .
Karen is the only one that knows anything .
Here 's another nugget to penetrate this blog 's fog : Google Prescott Bush coup .
You will return pages of links describing the coup attempt that W's grandfather was a part of to overthrow FDR .
Gen. Smedley Butler blew the whistle on the coup and saved the Constitution .
It 's in the Congressional Record , so it must be true .
So , folks , ask yourself this question --- how is it that the son and grandson of a traitor make it through a Presidential campaign , and this very embarrassing incident never comes up ?
How is it that this event has been scrubbed from the history books ?
How is it that nobody went to jail or was shot
Thirty three men contacted the service last year A Welsh women 's aid branch is changing its name to reflect the fact it is helping an increasing number of men .
De Gwynedd Women 's
Aid is changing its name to De Gwynedd Domestic Abuse Service from April .
The service said there was a need for the change as no-one , irrespective of gender , should have to suffer domestic abuse .
Welsh Women 's Aid said all Women 's Aid groups were autonomous and they respected their right to change .
" We 've noticed that more men are coming to us for help , and we decided that we would open the service out to anyone who is suffering domestic violence , " said Elwen Roberts from the De ( south ) Gwynedd group , which takes referrals from men from all over Gwynedd .
Ms Roberts said 33 men between April and December contacted the service - as part of an independent domestic violence advisor scheme - compared with 312 women .
I do n't think anyone has done any research into this , especially here in rural Wales
Elwen Roberts , De Gwynedd Domestic Abuse Service
All of them were referrals from the police - which means they were cases where there had been at least three domestic abuse incidents in the household .
" We feel this is a high enough figure to justify the change , there is a need for a service for them , " she said .
The service offered for men will be tailored for them , and staff will need to be trained to deal with it .
Screening will also be carried out to make sure the sufferer is genuine .
Although abuse suffered by men can be both physical and emotional , there was a tendency for more emotional abuse , she added .
' Disappointed '
" When we began women 's aid in the 70s very few women initially came forward , and it will be interesting to see over the years how big this problem is , " Ms Roberts said .
" I do n't think anyone has done any research into this , especially here in rural Wales . "
Ms Roberts also denied the change would mean the service was turning its back on its roots .
" I do n't see it like that at all as , at the end of the day , any domestic abuse is unacceptable , " she said .
Paula Hardy , chief executive officer of Welsh Women 's Aid ( WWA ) said it was " disappointing " to lose De Gwynedd Women 's Aid as a member group after many years of working together as part of the Women 's Aid movement in Wales .
" However , all Women 's Aid groups are autonomous organisations , and WWA recognise their right to move away from the feminist ethos of the movement , and make the decision to open their services up to men , " she added .
According to Home Office figures , it is estimated domestic abuse will affect one in four women and one in six men in their lifetime .

The identities of EU citizens were stolen by the assassins EU foreign ministers in Brussels have " strongly condemned " the use of forged European passports in the assassination of Hamas commander Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
The statement made no direct reference to Israel , whose secret services are widely accused of having carried out last month 's killing in Dubai .
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman met some foreign ministers on the sidelines of the meeting .
Mr Lieberman has reiterated there is " no proof " of Israel 's involvement .
" There is no proof Israel is involved in this affair , and if somebody had presented any proof , aside from press stories , we would have reacted , " Mr Lieberman said in a statement from his office .
" But since there are no concrete elements , there is no need to react . "
His comments followed the EU statement which said : " The killing of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh in Dubai raises issues which are profoundly disturbing .
We spent most of the time talking about the issue of the fraudulent use of British passports , and the profound concern that exists not just in Britain but all over Europe about this incident .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband
' More UK passports linked to killing '
" We strongly condemn the use of fraudulent EU member states ' passports and credit cards acquired through the theft of EU citizens ' identities . "
French President Nicolas Sarkozy also " unreservedly condemned " the assassination during a press conference with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas , news agency AFP said .
Mr Mabhouh was killed in Dubai by a team who had entered the country on assumed identities belonging to British , Irish , French and German citizens .
Israeli meeting
The foreign ministers of those countries have been questioning Mr Lieberman about Israel 's role in the assassination , in private meetings on Monday .
After meeting Mr Lieberman , UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said he had " set out for the foreign minister the seriousness of the issue as far as Britain was concerned " .
" We spent most of the time talking about the issue of the fraudulent use of British passports , and the profound concern that exists not just in Britain but all over Europe about this incident , " he said .
In another development on Monday , UK Foreign Office minister Chris Bryant said another two British passports had been linked to the assassination , bringing the total to eight .
Mr Mabhouh was murdered in a Dubai hotel room , police say The EU statement did not mention it by name , but Mossad , Israel 's secret service , is widely accused of being behind the killing .
The assassins , some disguised in wigs and moustaches , were filmed following Mr Mabhouh , on Dubai 's extensive CCTV network .
He was killed in his hotel room and an autopsy report said he had been electrocuted and then suffocated .
It has emerged that the British citizens whose identities were stolen also hold Israeli citizenship .
Six British Israeli citizens are to be given new passports by the British embassy in Jerusalem , it was announced on Sunday .
The British embassy said it was the first step to clearing their names , which are now on an Interpol wanted list .
Police in Dubai have also indicated there could be further revelations to come about the assassination .
Some of the estimated 18 - strong hit team could have entered the country using diplomatic passports , Lt Gen Dhahi Khalifan Tamim told reporters .

Abstract
This Article answers this question with the following jurisprudential hypothesis .
Many legal outcomes can be explained , and future cases predicted , by asking a very simple question : is there a plausible result in this case that will significantly affect the interests of the legal profession ( positively or negatively ) ?
If so , the case will be decided in the way that offers the best result for the legal profession .
The article presents theoretical support from the new institutionalism , cognitive psychology and economic theory .
The Article then gathers and analyzes supporting cases from areas as diverse as constitutional law , torts , professional responsibility , employment law , evidence , and criminal procedure .
The questions considered include : why are lawyers the only American profession to be truly and completely self - regulated ?
Why is it that the attorney - client privilege is the oldest and most jealously protected professional privilege ?
Why is it that the Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down bans on commercial speech , except for bans on in - person lawyer solicitations and some types of lawyer advertising ?
Why is it that the Miranda right to consult with an attorney is more protected than the right to remain silent ?
Why is legal malpractice so much harder to prove than medical malpractice ?
The Article finishes with some of the ramifications of the lawyer - judge hypothesis , including brief consideration of whether our judiciary should be staffed by lawyer - judges at all .
It ’s not easy , as we all have a tendency to want to defend or lash out from time to time .
It seems to be that our general nature is to be confrontational .
We feel that if we are n’t standing up for something we are nothing more than a doormat for others .
But , I think it ’s important to look at what the real goal is for any confrontation .
Will it ultimately increase the serenity of the mind , or is it nothing more than conflict for the sake of conflict .
Sometimes , it ’s best to let something go simply because the ultimate result is not peace of mind … but conflict merely to prove one is right .. in an argument where there is no right .

There are things you can do to clean up your credit report .
And yes there are , unfortunately , bad players out there who claim to be able to clean up your credit report in no time ( for a hefty fee ) .
There are two very important things to know about the credit repair industry .
No. 1 , anything a credit repair company can do , you can do yourself for free .
And No. 2 , you cannot remove accurate and timely items .
Only the creditor that placed the accurate negative item in your credit bureau file can remove it before it ages off ( usually after seven years ) .
But , unlike breaking a mirror , you do n’t need to suffer seven years of bad luck .
There are things you can do to repair and rebuild credit that has been damaged by negative items .
There is so much you can do that in fact , I have written an entire book on this subject called ” Credit Repair Kit For Dummies . ”
Given the limitations of this column , let ’s focus on just a few of my favorite tried and true actions you can take to improve matters .
The first is challenging information in your credit report , followed by getting a creditor to reverse a negative item and , lastly , using positive new information to offset credit damage .
Check out all the answers from our credit card experts .
Ask Steve a question .
Dispute credit report errors
The law allows you to dispute any item on your credit report in good faith if you are uncertain of its validity .
In other words , if you ca n’t find records that confirm the item , you ca n’t recall missing a payment or you are just uncertain that the information has been reported correctly or is even yours , you can ask the bureaus to prove it or remove it .
The first thing you must do is to pull your credit reports from the three major credit bureaus .
These are Equifax , Experian and TransUnion .
You are entitled to a free copy of each report annually at AnnualCreditReport.com .
I recommend pulling them all at once if you are concerned about your credit now so that you know exactly where you stand with each reporting agency .
Each one may have different information about you , as not all creditors report to all bureaus and the bureaus do n’t share information .
The best way to communicate with the bureaus is via good old - fashioned snail mail , sent certified with a return receipt requested .
This will establish a paper trail that will serve you well should problems arise and is well worth the cost of the extra postage .
Go over the reports carefully and make note of any items that show up on one or two reports but not all three .
This may not be a mistake ; it could just be that one bureau has more information than the others or it could indicate an error .
But it is good to know what the differences are .
Also , look for any items that you do not believe belong to you .
The credit reporting bureaus and the creditors who report your data to them are made up of people , just like you and me , and sometimes mistakes are made .
Actually , mistakes are made on about 25 % of all credit reports .
Mistakes can be corrected and items removed if they truly do n’t belong on your report .
A few years ago there was a Steve Bucci who was high up in the Department of Defense .
I liked seeing him quoted in the news , but would not have liked it if his credit showed up on my report .
In the case of accounts that are yours but that you believe are being mistakenly reported as negative items or beyond their expiration dates , you will need to include any information you have about the account in question ( for instance , how it is shown on your report ) and the reason you do not believe the account is being reported correctly ( copies of statements or letters from the lender ) .
Ask for verification from them because it could be that the account is listed under a name similar to yours .
Accounts listed as collections are notorious for not having backup data to substantiate their entries .
As accounts are sold and resold , identifying information often gets lost .
If this is the case , the account will be removed .
See related : 10 tips to improve your credit score in 2020
Ask your creditors to remove negative items
Negative items like late payments generally cannot be removed by the bureaus themselves , but you might be able to work with the creditor in question to have them removed .
This is especially true if you made a one - time error and you have a generally good relationship with the creditor .
Creditors like to keep their customers – that ’s you – happy if they can .
But this is not something you can do over and over again .
Generally , creditors may occasionally give you some leeway , but after that you must take your lumps and move on .
I have bumbled a payment or two in my time , but I have always called the creditor and made a good pitch about why they should cut a loyal customer like me some slack .
It almost always works .
For major lateness like a 90 - day delinquency , a good story may not be enough .
I suggest you include an offer to pay the arrearage at once if they would be so kind as to reverse the negative entry .
You may need to ask for a supervisor who has the authority to make the change , but it can be done .
Other items , like a collection notation , are again something you might be able to have removed by the creditor or collector if you incorporate removing the notations with a promise to pay over a set period of time .
It is always best to get a written agreement upfront that the item will not be reported before you pay off a collector .
What you can do is request that the item be removed ( sometimes called “ pay - for - delete ” ) or at least be noted as a “ paid collection . ”
While this is far better than a “ settled ” item , which is when you come to an agreement to pay them less than the full balance , it generally wo n’t help your credit score .
Furthermore , experts say large , reputable debt collection agencies wo n’t agree to pay - for - delete agreements , and they ’re less common than they have been in years past .
Tip :
Even if you successfully get a paid collection item removed from your credit report , the original trade line could still remain as a charge - off .
And your original creditor may have no incentive to remove that item .
The charged - off account would then stay on your credit report for seven years from the date of the first late payment .
Add more positive data to your credit report
Whether your file is thin or fat , adding positive trade lines will always help your score .
Negative information counts for less and less each month as it ages until it disappears altogether in seven years .
But around year two , most negative items have lost their big impact .
To rebuild your credit faster than just waiting for time to heal your wounds , try adding new accounts .
Easy adds include gas and retail cards , secured credit cards , passbook loans and installment loans on small furniture purchases .
Adding positive information to your file will speed your score recovery by balancing or offsetting negative data quickly .
Using programs like Experian Boost and UltraFICO can also be helpful in getting approved when you decide to apply for new credit .
Of course , be sure to make those new payments on time , every time , and you ’ll be in the good credit column before you know it .
Remember to keep track of your score !
Texting while driving can be dangerous , and 19 states already prohibit the practice .
The Governors Highway Safety Association has spoken out in support of such bans , and President Obama has banned texting while driving for all federal employees .
A group of researchers at Clemson University 's Human - Centered Computing Lab hopes to make texting by voice a " less - distracted , " safer alternative .
Sending text messages is more popular than calling in the US , though there is no definitive answer why .
" The simple answer is we do n't really know why , " Dr. Juan Gilbert , director of Clemson 's Human - Centered Computing department , told Ars .
" What we do know is that users do n't want to call , but want to text . "
Gilbert and his team have developed a technology called VoiceTEXT to address that concern .
The system works by connecting a cell phone to an in - car hands - free system and setting it to " vocal " mode .
This will connect the phone to a central server , which can then record and send messages .
Depending on the status of the receiving phone , the message will be transmitted as a voicemail message , an e-mail with a link to the message audio file , or transcribed using speech recognition software and sent as an SMS message .
Text messages sent to the phone in " vocal " mode can be read aloud to the driver using text - to - speech software .
The system uses a remote server , which users dial into when using vocal mode .
However , Gilbert told
Ars that individual apps could be made for different phones to make activation and interfacing with the server even easier .
Such apps could also be used to upload contact data to the server , which is needed to interpret voice commands for selecting a recipient of a message .
Certainly smartphones could be tapped to provide similar functionality , using the iPhone 's Voice Control feature .
The benefit of Gilbert 's system , however , is that it does n't require any specific phone or OS .
" Your cell provider would offer this as an option , " he told Ars .
" We are looking to get the technology licensed by Google , Verizon , OnStar , or other service providers . "
No deals have been yet been made , but Gilbert believes the system is mature enough that it could be implemented , tested , and operational before the end of this year .
Finding domain names with Node.js
I 'm working on some ideas for finance or news software that deliberately updates infrequently , so it does n't reward me for reloading it constantly .
I came up with the name " microhertz " to describe the idea .
( 1 microhertz ≈ once every eleven and a half days . )
As usual when I think of a project name , I did some DNS searches .
Unfortunately " microhertz.com " is not available ( but " microhertz.org " is ) .
Then I went off on a tangent and got curious about which other SI units are available as domain names .
This was the perfect opportunity to try node.js so I could use its asynchronous DNS library to run dozens of lookups in parallel .
I grabbed a list of units and prefixes from NIST and wrote the following script :
var dns = require ( " dns " ) , sys = require ( ' sys ' ) ; var prefixes = [ " yotta " , " zetta " , " exa " , " peta " , " tera " , " giga " , " mega " , " kilo " , " hecto " , " deka " , " deci " , " centi " , " milli " , " micro " , " nano " , " pico " , " femto " , " atto " , " zepto " , " yocto " ] ; var units = [ " meter " , " gram " , " second " , " ampere " , " kelvin " , " mole " , " candela " , " radian " , " steradian " , " hertz " , " newton " , " pascal " , " joule " , " watt " , " colomb " , " volt " , " farad " , " ohm " , " siemens " , " weber " , " henry " , " lumen " , " lux " , " becquerel " , " gray " , " sievert " , " katal " ] ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < prefixes .
length ; i ++ ) { for ( var j = 0 ; j < units .
length ; j ++ ) { checkAvailable ( prefixes [ i ] + units [ j ] + " .com " , sys . puts ) ; } } function checkAvailable ( name , callback ) { dns .
resolve4 ( name ) . addErrback ( function ( e ) { if ( e . errno == dns .
NXDOMAIN ) callback ( name ) ; } ) }
Out of 540 possible .com names , I found 376 that are available ( and 10 more that produced temporary DNS errors , which I have n't investigated ) .
Here are a few interesting ones , with some commentary :
exasecond.com – 32 billion years
petasecond.com – 32 million years
petawatt.com – can be produced for femtoseconds by powerful lasers
terapascal.com
gigakelvin.com – possible temperature of picosecond flashes in sonoluminescence
giganewton.com – 225 million pounds force
gigafarad.com
kilosecond.com – 16 minutes 40 seconds
kilokelvin.com – 1340 degrees Fahrenheit
centiohm.com
millifarad.com
microkelvin.com
picohertz.com – once every 31,689 years
picojoule.com
femtogram.com – mass of a single virus
yoctogram.com – a hydrogen atom weighs 1.66 yoctograms
zeptomole.com – 602 molecules

I ’m posting this to let those of you ( who are submitting this ) know that I do n’t understand why you find it noteworthy .
With all the posts I ’ve done on network surveillance , I ’m getting story submissions about retention of URLs ?
Guys , splash some cold water on your faces , break out the smelling salts , wake up .
It might be that what is already known to be in place and operational is too disturbing to comprehend .
Is it comforting to read the limited hangout articles du jure , jump up and down and think , “ Wow , at least they ’re not officially admitting to be doing this yet ” ???
Of course , those who have been paying attention know that the situation is far worse than this absurd piece by Declan McCullagh indicates .
Absurd ?
Yes .
Look at this :
The technical challenges also may be formidable .
John Seiver , an attorney at Davis Wright Tremaine who represents cable providers , said one of his clients had experience with a law enforcement request that required the logging of outbound URLs .
“ Eighteen million hits an hour would have to have been logged , ” a staggering amount of data to sort through , Seiver said .
The purpose of the FBI ’s request was to identify visitors to two URLs , “ to try to find out … who ’s going to them . ”
The purpose of this bilge is to implant the idea in the reader ’s mind that capturing all of the URLs MAY NOT EVEN BE POSSIBLE !
I have n’t had such a satisfying laugh in a long time .
I ’ll make this as simple as I can .

The Ship of Fools is drawing nearer to certain oblivion .
URL retention is an absurd red herring when placed in the context of what is already known to be in place at the carrier level , and almost certainly much closer to endusers as well .
Some will find comfort in the belief that there ’s a meaningful difference between domestic law enforcement and national security cases .
Might it be that the black world infrastructure is n’t used for domestic law enforcement ?
Fools will go to their graves believing this .
Unfortunately , we must assume that the state will use ( and is using ) every tool at its disposal to maintain and expand its power .
I — and many others — have pointed out what ’s sitting on the wire .
Assumed to be the case by researchers for decades , with Klein / EFF / ATT / NSA , routine , illegal mass surveillance is an indisputable fact .
URL retention is but a mere side show in the scheme of things .

Dr. Sweeney and team you are the Dental gods .
Best dental experience you can ask for .
I have had a crown on my front tooth replaced 3 times by 3 different dentist and it never looked right .
With still some hope left that I could get a nicer crown I came to Dr. Sweeney and y’all he achieved beyond what I expected .
My teeth are beautiful , I can confidently smile again !
Iris Quintero
Never thought I would look forward to a dental appointment after decades of suffering from my gripping phobia of dentists .
The staff is so kind , attentive and comforting .
Dr. Jordan is an angel .
For the very first time , I trust my dentist and this process entirely .
This is the most relaxing place and I ’m beyond grateful that I found it .
Austin Dental Spa has been life changing for me .
Maggie San Miguel
Going to the dentist for anything other than a cleaning takes a lot of trust and confidence in your dentist .
And that is not easy to feel .
I recommend you visit Dr. Sweeney – you ’ll be so glad you are in his care .
His standard of excellence ensures you are informed , comfortable , and that you ’ll receive the best dental care possible , and his kind and competent staff are just the same .
When I visit Dr. Sweeney , I know I am going to receive the best care .
Julie Lame
Dr. Sweeney is an artist , and a lovely human being .
I was referred by our orthodontist , who recommends all of his patients that need cosmetic dentistry to this practice .
The staff is amazing , they truly operate as a team , and the added bonus of complimentary hand and foot massages during treatments is incredible .
I ’m a patient for life now and highly recommend this business .
Ronaldo Bvaldez
The best dental care in Austin .
You are always called back at the time of your appointment .
Outstanding dental assistants that know you , care about your overall health and care about you as a person put you quickly at ease !.
From the greeting when you walk into the door to your visit with Mark as he checks on the health and welfare of ever patient , you cannot find a more caring and professional group of people .

As D.C. continued to dig out from Snowmageddon and is keeping an eye on another storm system , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was busy making a climate change announcement .
NOAA , part of the Department of Commerce , is going to be providing information to individuals and decision - makers through a new NOAA Climate Service office .
“ More and more , Americans are witnessing the impacts of climate change in their own backyards , including sea - level rise , longer growing seasons , changes in river flows , increases in heavy downpours , earlier snowmelt and extended ice - free seasons in our waters .
People are searching for relevant and timely information about these changes to inform decision - making about virtually all aspects of their lives , ” the release says .
Earlier snowmelt ?
That would be nice .
Turns out the release was planned prepared ahead of the snowstorm , which shut federal agencies today and forced its senders to hold a press conference by telephone instead of at the National Press Club .
It ’s not the first time inclement weather has put a chill on official efforts to tackle climate change .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had to leave the Copenhagen summit early in December to get back to D.C. before the blizzard known as Snowpocalypse grounded all flights .
We know how this argument goes : Climate change - skeptics such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says that the weather conditions prove that “ global warming ” is a hoax ; activists say that scientists are looking at longer - lasting weather patterns .
But , says NOAA spokesman Justin Kenney , they ’re happy to have a chance to educate people about the difference between the climate and the weather .

Every once in a while , we ’ve got to exercise those “ data recovery ” muscles .
It ’s not typically fun , it can wind up in cold sweats , but if you ’ve planned and worked hard , it usually resolves itself alright .
A while back , I was told that I had to do a historic search through our email for a couple of strings , and that it was due in the middle of this month .
Of course , I procrastinated .
I mean heck , this was a couple of months ago .
A couple of months ago , the assignment was due next year .
Why rush ?
Right ?
Fast forward to last week , when the assignment was no longer due next year , in fact , I was informed that it was due next week .
Awesome .
So I made immediate plans to extract the data from the antiquated mail server that was originally installed circa -2005 .
We keep it around for sentimental reasons , and also because it still houses a ton of mail that we have n’t imported into Global Relay .
I was designing the most efficient plan of attack in the back of my mind while I attended the LOPSA - NJ meeting when I got an email .
Next week ?
Not so much .
The entirety of the emails were required the next morning , in full .
Looking at the top of my phone , I saw that it was 9:30 pm .
I estimated that after the 45 minute drive home , plus the 15 minute trip to work , I could probably bang out the emails and be home before midnight .
As it turns out , I was a little off .
I recall stumbling into bed at 4 am on Friday morning .
Vaguely .
Friday went smoothly , probably .
I do n’t remember , exactly , but I showed up and apparently made it home , and had a relaxing weekend which involved more sleep than the entire week before .
Which was good , because on Monday I found out that it was n’t enough to extract the emails .
I had to provide every client report mentioned , referenced , or otherwise alluded to in the entire span of messages .
Awesome .
Now , the data that I had dragged out of the mail server was vintage 2005 – 2006 .
And from clients we no longer had .
I do n’t know about where you ’re from , but 5 year old data from legacy clients does n’t sit around on my SAN eating up expensive drive space .
It was on a tape .
Unfortunately , it was on a 5 year old tape .
Depending on the exact month , it could have been on a tape 2 generations old or 3 generations old .
As luck would have it , it was on a 2 generation old tape , a VXA - 2 , to be precise .
The tape itself was a VXA - 3 , but we had n’t upgraded the tape drive in the changer yet , which is fortunate , because the tape drive in the changer was shot .
Shot as in “ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/st1 bs=1k count=100 ” pulled an I / O error after 3 minutes .
Awesome .
As luck would have it , when we originally ordered the tape changer , we ordered an equivalent standalone drive for our other office , which would serve as a backup site , if need be .
I pulled the drive off the shelf , unplugged the tape library from the now - unpowered server , wired it up to the standalone drive , powered everything on , and crossed every filange I owned .
As it turns out , the standalone drive worked , owing in a large part , I ’m sure , to the fact that it had probably read 2 or 3 tapes in it ’s long life , uneventful life .
At this time , it was around 4 pm .
I located a tape set from an appropriate date range that probably still included the client files , popped in the first tape , and used ‘ tar ’ to get a directory listing , praying that it did n’t give me an I / O error .
And my prayers were rewarded by a reassuring list of hundreds of files .
I killed the output , initiated a screen session , and started extracting to a volume that had a couple of tapes worth of space free .
This morning , I came back in to check on it .
I was n’t asked to insert the next tape until nearly 10 am .
I ca n’t imagine why we moved beyond VXA .
By noon , the client data that I needed had been extracted completely .
I verified it for sanity , and sent an exuberant instant message that I had all of the data , and everything was fine .
This is n’t the first time I ’ve had to pull old data off of a tape , but it is a rarity in my company , something that I ’m thankful for .
Typically , my biggest problem is locating the right tape set from the right date .
My old tapes are in somewhat of a disarray , and I was n’t always so clear as I am now about what goes on a tape .
I was shuddering as I went back through and saw things like “ Sunday , 15th .
File Sync ” .
Well , that ’s helpful .
I ’d go back in time and smack myself , but I have no idea when I made that mistake .
In any event , I recovered the data that I needed .
There IS a punchline to this story though .
A few minutes after I sent the IM , I got a visit at my desk .
I was thanked heartily for my efforts , but as it turned out , the original request for the data had been made erroneously .
We did n’t need to provide any emails or client data related to the original search .
There may be some other search terms that I might need to look for though …
Oh , and lest there be any doubt .
While I ’ve got the drive hooked up and working , it ’s time to migrate some old data onto next - gen tapes .
Progress !

The WISE ( Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer ) mission is n’t wasting any time in making observations and releasing images .
Already the new infrared observatory has spied its first comet and first near Earth asteroid , and today released a “ sweet ” collection of eye candy from across the universe .
“ We ’ve got a candy store of images coming down from space , ” said Edward ( Ned ) Wright of UCLA , the principal investigator for WISE .
“ Everyone has their favorite flavors , and we ’ve got them all . ”
Four new , processed pictures illustrate a sampling of the mission ’s targets — a bursting star - forming cloud , a faraway cluster of hundreds of galaxies , a wispy comet , and above , the grand Andromeda galaxy as we ’ve never seen it before , with new details of its ringed arms of stars .
Another image shows a bright and choppy star - forming region called NGC 3603 , lying 20,000 light - years away in the Carina spiral arm of our Milky Way galaxy .
This star - forming factory is churning out batches of new stars , some of which are monstrously massive and hotter than the sun .
The hot stars warm the surrounding dust clouds , causing them to glow at infrared wavelengths .
This image shows the beauty of a comet called Siding Spring .
As the comet parades toward the sun , it sheds dust that glows in infrared light visible to WISE .
The comet ’s tail , which stretches about 10 million miles , looks like a streak of red paint .
A bright star appears below it in blue .
WISE is expected to find perhaps dozens of comets , and bagged its first one on January 22 , 2010 .
WISE will help unravel clues locked inside comets about how our solar system came to be .
The fourth WISE picture is of the Fornax cluster , a region of hundreds of galaxies all bound together into one family .
These galaxies are 60 million light - years from Earth .
The mission ’s infrared views reveal both stagnant and active galaxies , providing a census of data on an entire galactic community .
“ All these pictures tell a story about our dusty origins and destiny , ” said Peter Eisenhardt , the WISE project scientist at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
“ WISE sees dusty comets and rocky asteroids tracing the formation and evolution of our solar system .
We can map thousands of forming and dying solar systems across our entire galaxy .
We can see patterns of star formation across other galaxies , and waves of star - bursting galaxies in clusters millions of light years away . ”
Since WISE began its scan of the entire sky in infrared light on Jan. 14 , the space telescope has beamed back more than a quarter of a million raw , infrared images .
The mission will scan the sky one - and - a - half times by October .
At that point , the frozen coolant needed to chill its instruments will be depleted .
However , the team predicts the spacecraft will be still be operational for 3 additional months following the 10 month prime mission .
So , stay tuned for more images from WISE !

Beef Tea ( English )
A horrible pain to make correctly ... but no trouble at all when you 've got a weak invalid on your hands and are anxious to " beef " him or her up .
Two versions , below .
Serve warm , in bed , to one sick chick .
Then sit back to watch the roses bloom in those pale cheeks .
1/2 pound round steak , cut 1 - inch thick
water
salt
Broil the steak 2 minutes per side
Then , right in the broiling pan , cut the steak into 1 - inch squares -- and put the squares into a glass pint jar .
Be sure to scrape up the bottom of the pan with one of the squares and get every scrap of goodness into the jar .
Pour cold water over the meat to cover , then put the jar into a pot of cold water .
The point here is not to cook , but to steep the meat .
Turn the heat to low and let the goodness leach out of the meat slowly , over the next two hours or so .
When ready to serve , pour off the beef tea , salt slightly to taste , and serve warm , preferably on a tray with silver and linen napkins in a beautiful cup .
When you view an email in Mozilla Thunderbird , it looks at each of the URLs in the body , and does a DNS lookup on each of the domains .
It does this so the page loads faster if you click on the link .
It does n’t just happen on HTML emails , it also happens for plain text emails .
Viewing the body in “ Plain Text ” mode rather than the “ Original HTML ” or “ Simple HTML ” modes does n’t prevent it either .
This also happens when using webmail clients like GMail and Hotmail and I will discuss that further down the article .
Email clients tend to have a configuration option to prevent remote images from being loaded , and on sane clients this is set by default .
If a remote image is fetched to be displayed inside an email , the sender can determine that the email has been read , when it was read , and the IP address it was read from .
Even if remote images are disabled in Thunderbird , the DNS prefetching still takes place .
A spammer with the domain “ example.com , ” could send out a mail - shot to all of their addresses , with each email containing a URL with a unique domain .
Eg :
http :
They could configure the DNS server on example .com to log all DNS queries .
This is simple to do using the Bind DNS server :
logging { channel query_logging { file " / var/log/ bind / query " versions 3 size 100 M print - time yes } category queries { query_logging } }
They would then write a simple script for tailing the log file at / var / log / bind / query looking for DNS lookups containing “ mailshotY.example.com ” .
I tested this on the very latest version of Thunderbird ( 3.0.1 ) , on both OSX ( Snow Leopard ) and Windows XP ; both were affected .
I also tested on Apple Mail and Outlook 2007 , neither of which were affected .
I did n’t bother testing Mutt or Pine .
This issue seems to have been discussed back in May , but they do n’t seem to have done anything about it .
Worryingly , this issue also affects viewing email in webmail clients .
I tested it using hotmail and gmail and both did DNS prefetching on the URLs in the email body .
Using HTTPS rather than HTTP disables DNS prefetching .
Luckily for GMail users , they recently made all requests HTTPS by default .
This would be easily fixed in webmail clients by using X - DNS - Prefetch - Control .
In the HTML just before the email is displayed , you would put the following tag to disable prefetching :
< meta http -equiv = " x - dns- prefetch - control " content = " off " >
In the HTML immediately after the email you would turn DNS prefetching back on with :
< meta http -equiv = " x - dns- prefetch - control " content = " on " >
Update :
Patches for the Webmail clients IMP ( ref ) and RoundCube ( ref ) have been produced .
If you ’re serving Webmail with Apache , you can patch this problem in the web server it ’s self by adding some mod_headers config like this :
Header set X - DNS - Prefetch - Control
If you ’re using Thunderbird , you can fix the problem locally by going into the advanced config editor and adding a preference named “ network.dns.disablePrefetch ” with a boolean value of “ true ”

The W3C is still grappling with the issues around content transformation .
As I wrote back in August , the Mobile Web Best Practices Working Group ( BPWG ) within the W3C is in the process of formulating a set of Content Transformation Guidelines , defining how web to mobile transcoders should work .
The discussions have been extremely heated .
Virtually everyone developing mobile web sites just wants transcoders to leave their content alone .
There ’s considerable distrust in the developer community about the the BPWG , which many feel is stacked in favor of transcoder vendors .
It does n’t help that at least 11 of the 35 BPWG members are employed by companies that build transcoders or carriers that have deployed them .
Many also question whether the CTG is even needed as a similar document , Rules for Responsible Reformatting : A Developer Manifesto ( The Manifesto ) already exists , has received wide support in the developer community and been adopted by four transcoder vendors .
The Manifesto was created by a group of mobile web developers on the wmlprogramming mailing list run by WURFL creator Luca Passani .
The latest issue that the BPWG is tackling is how transcoders should handle HTTPS .
The problem is that in order to reformat HTTPS content transcoders must decrypt it , breaking end - to - end security .
This is a huge issue and one that is central to the future of mobile services like online banking , shopping , and payments on mobile devices .
On the web , HTTPS is used to provide encrypted end to end connections between the user ’s browser and a bank , social network , web - mail service or payment processor ’s server .
HTTPS is not limited to PC browsers .
Direct mobile browsers like Safari , S60 Webkit , Android Chrome , Netfront , Opera Mobile or even legacy WAP2 browsers like Openwave and Motorola MIB also support end to end HTTPS connections .
Transcoding proxies like OpenWeb , Infogin and Novarra have to decrypt HTTPS traffic in order to transform it and then re-encrypt it .
The single end to end connection becomes two separate secure sessions with a gap in the middle where supposedly encrpted data is in plain text and could theoretically be compromised by someone with malicious intent .
The problem is n’t limited to transcoders like OpenWeb and Novarra either .
The increasingly popular server based browsers like Opera Mini , UCWeb , Skyfire , Bolt and Teashark must also decrypt secure data in order to process it .
The core question is whether the two parties in a secure data exchange ( you and your bank , for example ) are aware of this potential security risk and agree to allow it .
The draft CTG currently say this about HTTPS :
“ If the response contains links whose URIs have the scheme https proxies may only rewrite them so that they can transform the content of linked resources , if the following provision is met .
If a proxy does rewrite such links , it must advise the user of the security implications of doing so and must provide the option to avoid decryption and transformation of the resources the links refer to .
If a proxy re-writes HTTPS links , replacement links must have the scheme https .
Note :
For clarity it is emphasized that it is not possible for a transforming proxy to transform content accessed via an HTTPS link without breaking end to end security . ”
That statement does require the end user to be notified , but not the other party to the transaction – the operator of the site that mandated the use of HTTPS in the first place .
There have been some critical public comments on the CTG mailing list that seemed to have prompted the BPWG to revisit the topic .
In the latest round of public comments at least three approaches have been proposed :
1. Develop additional rules around how and when transcoders should be allowed to intercept HTTPS traffic .
For example , only allowing transcoding of sites that have specifically granted permission for transcoders to alter their encrypted data .
2. Prohibit transcoding of HTTPS data streams altogether .
3 . Removing all mention of HTTPS from the CTG on the grounds the topic is out of scope and / or too contentious to reach agreement on .
This is the approach the Manifesto currently takes , although Luca has made it clear that he believes that transcoders should not touch HTTPS traffic without explicit permission from content providers .
Personally I think that the CTG appears too concerned with the needs of transcoder vendors and not enough with those of end users and content providers .
Breaking end to end security is a big deal and should only be permitted with the explicit approval of both parties to the transaction .
I feel that the W3 c should be soliciting input from the financial industry , especially banks and payment processors .
Security of transcoders and server based browsers is not only a technical problem , it ’s also social and business problem .
I wonder if there is a financial industry group willing to take on responsibility for auditing the security practices of transcoder and server based browser vendors .
Such a group could approve browsers and transcoders and manage a central white - list where content providers could list the URLs of services that they authorize the approved services to transcode .
User permission is also necessary .
I ’d like to see a warning and prompt presented to the user when they first access an HTTPS site using a transcoder or server based browser .
The wording needs to be clear , something like “ Do you allow < Name of Proxy > to decrypt the information on < URL > in order to reformat it for you phone ?
The user should be able to grant blanket or one shot permission .
I trust the major transcoder and server based browser vendors like Opera , InfoGin , Skyfire , Openwave , Bitstream and Novarra .
I believe that they are serious about security .
However without the buy - in of users and especially financial service providers they are at risk of having their access to these services blocked .
It is actually in the best interests of transcoder and browser vendors to be audited by and receive the approval from the secure sites that they are transforming .
Doing this on a site by site basis is obviously not scalable but a centralized clearing house could be .
The BPWG is accepting public comments on this topic .
If you have an opinion now is the time to be heard .
There have been lots of comments from mobile developers and BPWG members but only a couple from anyone whose main interest is online security .
It would be great to see more people with experience in online banking or payment processing weigh in on this issue .
To be most effective comments should be made on the main topic thread by replying to the message : ACTION - 893 : Start putting together a set of guidelines that could help address the security issues triggered by links rewriting .
Update : See Tom Godber ’s post on this issue .
Tom works in the mobile security field and his post explains how https works in a clear and non-technical way and includes an example of how a thief could exploit a transcoded “ secure ” connection .

Update [ 6:11 pm ] -
The Post - Gazette's Shelly Anderson reports that FSN Pittsburgh has suspended a staff member responsible for not sending the video replay along to the NHL .
To make matters worse , and only further strengthen conspiracy theories , the man suspended is the son of former Penguin Lowell MacDonald ( 1970 - 78 ) .
[ Original Post : ]
Remember when Simon Gagne put a shot on net against the Penguins last Thursday night and we all more or less agreed it looked like a goal ?
Well , we were n't the only ones , outside of Flyers fans of course .
The league is investigating why we did n't get all angles of the replay , " Meagher said .
Meagher said FSN should have sent all of the replays , and that it does not have the right to pick and choose which replays it sends .
" You can't have that happen , " he said .
" The league is concerned and it is being addressed . "
Philly.com
The NHL is apparantly investigating FSN Pittsburgh for having potentially withheld tape during the replay portion of the game .
As you may recall , the ruling on the ice was a no - goal .
After a video review in which it seemed like the refs had inconclusive evidence that it would remain a no - goal , FSN Pittsburgh showed an angle of the goal that more or less concluded that it was in the net .
In the end it might not matter much because the Flyers still won the game 7 - 4 , although one could argue that Simon Gagne was robbed of his 500th career point ( he 'd later pick it up on home ice Saturday night ) .
But for posterity 's sake , more so since no one wants to give Flyers fans more reason to believe in any sort of conspiracy theories , I really hope this does n't turn out to be a bigger deal than it should be .
This is going to get weird .
Especially given the fact that one of the FSN Pitt announcers ( ca n't remember which one and do n't want to single out one over the other ) said , " We saved that one ! " when the FSN - Pittsburgh angle was shown after the ruling .
Simon Gagne has also gone on record as saying the network should be " fined heavily . "
As you can imagine , Broad Street Hockey is all over this as well both here and here .

Ursula Le Guin Resigns from the Authors Guild : " You Have Sold Us Down the River "
* If you do n't know what the hell is going on here , first read or listen to this interview with Professor James Grimmelmann at the New York Law School * Calling the Authors Guild cowards and claiming that they have done a deal with the devil as a result of the Google Book Settlement , Ursula Le Guin -- one of the most well - respected writers of fiction on planet Earth ( five Hugo awards , six Nebula awards , and one National Book Award ) -- has resigned from the Authors Guild , hinting that the leadership of the Guild has become out of touch with real working writers as a result of easy living and enervated Eastern decadence .
Here is Le Guin 's official letter of resignation " 18 December 2009To
Whom it may concern at the Authors Guild : I have been a member of the Authors Guild since 1972 .
At no time during those thirty - seven years was I able to attend the functions , parties , and so forth offered by the Guild to members who happen to live on the other side of the continent .
I have naturally resented this geographical discrimination , reflected also in the officership of the Guild , always almost all Easterners .
But it was a petty gripe when I compared it to my gratitude to the Guild for the work you were doing in defending writers ' rights .
I went on paying top dues and thought it worth it .
And now you have sold us down the river .
I am not going to rehearse any arguments pro and anti the " Google settlement . "
You decided to deal with the devil , as it were , and have presented your arguments for doing so .
I wish I could accept them .
I can't .
There are principles involved , above all the whole concept of copyright ; and these you have seen fit to abandon to a corporation , on their terms , without a struggle .
So , after being a loyal if invisible member for so long , I am resigning from the Guild .
I am , however , retaining membership in the National Writers Union and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America , both of which opposed the " Google settlement . "
They do n't have your clout , but their judgment , I think , is sounder , and their courage greater .
Yours truly , Ursula K. Le Guin " *** Here is the Authors Guild 's response " We appreciate Ursula K. Le Guin 's many years of membership and regret that she has chosen to resign from the Guild .
We are open and eager to discuss this matter with her at any time .
In many respects , we agree with Ms. Le Guin .
We hold the principles of copyright to be fundamental -- they are bedrock principles for the Authors Guild and the economics of authorship .
That 's why we sued Google in the first place .
It would therefore have been deeply satisfying , on many levels , to litigate our case to the end and win , enjoining Google from scanning books and forcing it to destroy the scans it had made .
It also would have been irresponsible , once a path to a satisfactory settlement became available .
Litigation , particularly litigation over the bounds of fair use , involves risk .
Some critics of the settlement wrongly dismiss that risk , but the fact is that we certainly could have lost the case .
Losing would have meant that anyone , not just Google , could have digitized copyright protected books and made them available through search engines .
Since creating a search engine is rather simple , anyone with a website -- Civil War buffs , science fiction fans , medical information providers -- would then have been empowered to start the uncontrolled scanning of books and the display of " snippets . "
Authors would have no say in those uses and no control over the security of those scans .
The damage to copyright protection would have been incalculable .
The lessons of recent history are clear : when digital and online technologies meet traditional media , traditional media generally wind up gutted .
Constructive engagement -- in this case turning Google 's infringement to our advantage -- is sometimes the only realistic solution .
Google 's scanning project wo n't be the only battlefield , there are countless challenges ahead .
We need the institutional resources to deal with those challenges .
We need the Book Rights Registry , our ASCAP , as desperately as the music industry needed its with the advent of radio .
The settlement is a good one for authors .
It will open up new streams of revenues for authors from out - of - print books , books that provide no income to authors now .
The settlement allows authors to decide whether , when and to what extent to make their works available through Google .
In an increasingly challenging online environment , authors need every bit of income they can earn . "*** Le Guin to AG : " You are gutless cowards and you sold us down the river without a fight . " AG to Le Guin : " God lady : do n't you know ANYTHING about history or science ? "
Let us know what you make of the first Peter Gabriel record in eight years , which covers Talking Heads , Radiohead and Bowie
For his first studio album in eight years , Peter Gabriel came up with an audacious plan .
He decided to cover the work of his favourite artists and , in exchange , they would do the same for him .
Scratch My Back is the first instalment of this project , and sees the 59 - year - old , ex-Genesis man cover the likes of Radiohead , Talking Heads and David Bowie .
The artists whose songs you hear here will be returning the favour by performing Gabriel 's songs on a forthcoming album , I 'll Scratch Yours .
You can hear Scratch My Back using the widget below .
So has Gabriel improved on the originals here ?

The human body may be equipped with a separate sensory system aside from the nerves that gives us the ability to touch and feel , according to a new study .
Most of us have millions of different types of nerve endings just beneath the skin that let us feel our surroundings .
However , the once - hidden and recently discovered skin sense , found in two patients , is located throughout the blood vessels and sweat glands , and most of us do n't even notice it 's there .
" It 's almost like hearing the subtle sound of a single instrument in the midst of a symphony , " said senior author Frank Rice , a neuroscience professor at Albany Medical College in New York .
" It is only when we shift focus away from the nerve endings associated with normal skin sensation that we can appreciate the sensation hidden in the background . "
Sensitive skin
Our skin , the body 's largest organ , seems to have some extraordinary qualities , as another recent study showed skin can hear .
The new finding , detailed in the Dec. 15 issue of the journal Pain , could help scientists to understand mysterious pain conditions such as migraine headaches and fibromyalgia .
The study , and others by the team , was supported by the National Institutes of Health and several pharmaceutical companies .
The research team discovered the sensory system when studying two patients who were born with very little ability to feel pain — an extremely rare condition called congenital insensitivity to pain .
Other individuals with this condition have excessively dry skin , often mutilate themselves accidentally and usually have severe mental handicaps , the researchers say .
It was n't their pain - free lives that brought the patients into the lab , but rather excessive sweating .
" Curiously , our conventional tests with sensitive instruments revealed that all their skin sensation was severely impaired , including their response to different temperatures and mechanical contact , " said study researcher Dr. David Bowsher , Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the University of Liverpool 's Pain Research Institute .
" But , for all intents and purposes , they had adequate sensation for daily living and could tell what is warm and cold , what is touching them , and what is rough and smooth . "
Surprise results
Bowsher took skin biopsies and sent them to Rice 's lab for microscopic analyses of the nerve endings .
" Much to our surprise , the skin we received from England lacked all the nerve endings that we normally associated with skin sensation , " Rice said .
" So how were these individuals feeling anything ? "
The answer :
While the patients lacked the usual nerve endings in the skin , Rice and colleagues found sensory nerve endings on the small blood vessels and sweat glands embedded in their skin .
" Apparently , these unique individuals are able to ' feel things ' through these remaining nerve endings , " Rice said .
" For many years , my colleagues and I have detected different types of nerve endings on tiny blood vessels and sweat glands , which we assumed were simply regulating blood flow and sweating . "

However , while all the other sensory endings were missing in this unusual skin , the blood vessels and sweat glands still had the normal types of nerve endings . "
VeriSign 's iDefense security lab has published a report with technical details about the recent cyberattack that hit Google and over 30 other companies .
The iDefense researchers traced the attack back to its origin and also identified the command - and - control servers that were used to manage the malware .
The cyber - assault came to light on Tuesday when Google disclosed to the public that the Gmail Web service was targeted in a highly - organized attack in late December .
Google said that the intrusion attempt originated from China and was executed with the goal of obtaining information about political dissidents , but the company declined to speculate about the identity of the perpetrator .
Citing sources in the defense contracting and intelligence consulting community , the iDefense report unambiguously declares that the Chinese government was , in fact , behind the effort .
" The source IPs and drop server of the attack correspond to a single foreign entity consisting either of agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof , " the report says .
The iDefense report initially stated that malicious PDFs were crafted to deploy the malware that was used in the attack .
Adobe disputed that claim and issued a statement saying that they have found no evidence that their technology was used as an attack vector .
This is supported by independent research conducted by security firm McAfee , which has found evidence that a vulnerability in Internet Explorer — but not Acrobat Reader — was exploited in the attack .
iDefense later retracted its claim about PDFs , but stands behind the rest of its report .
The researchers have determined that there are significant similarities between the recent attack and a seemingly related one that was carried out in July against a large number of US companies .
Both attacks were apparently managed through the same command - and - control servers .
" The servers used in both attacks employ the HomeLinux DynamicDNS provider , and both are currently pointing to IP addresses owned by Linode , a US - based company that offers Virtual Private Server hosting .
The IP addresses in question are within the same subnet , and they are six IP addresses apart from each other , " the report says .
" Considering this proximity , it is possible that the two attacks are one and the same , and that the organizations targeted in the Silicon Valley attacks have been compromised since July . "
If the report 's findings are correct , it suggests that the government of China has been engaged for months in a massive campaign of industrial espionage against US companies .
J Maranzano Agricola is a horticultural wholesale company which was established in Borgo San Martino in the late 1980s .
The owner – Mr. Justo Maranzano misses the good old days when the competition in the industry was too low , there was no internet or smartphones and he was an ambitious young man with great ambitions and dreams .
J Maranzano Agricola is still ahead of most of its competition but Mr Justo Maranzano cannot stop missing the ways the things happened back in his day and the vigor and virility of his mind , body and soul that he felt back then .
Mr Justo Maranzano says that he would appreciate it a lot if the government of Italy and its bodies reduce the interference in the business .
He also believes that the press does n’t care about the horticultural industry like they did until the Mid-1990s .
He further adds that he and others in the business could totally rely upon the press for providing them nothing but reliable information regarding different aspects of the business , but that ’s not the case anymore .
Mr Justo Maranzano is glad that as more people are becoming aware about the benefits of eating nothing but health food , the sales of the horticultural industry has only risen , especially the carrots , while that of the junk food has been totally shaken .
Mr Justo Maranzano ’s company has been wholesaling only the carrots that they grow at one of the oldest , most trusted carrot growing company which goes by the name ELIO FAVA SRL .
Mr Justo has a great relationship with ELIO FAVA since the very beginning and he was told by his mentor to never use another company when it comes to selling carrots and Mr Justo has really been following his mentor ’s advice ever since .
Mr Justo Maranzano never believed in business consultation programs before but after he went through the same on the advice of a friend and to everyone ’s surprise , he has become the greatest advocate of business consultation programs ever since .
He now recommends that every horticultural business owner must go through a business consultation program .
J Maranzano Agricola claims to have the highest donation to net income ratio in the horticultural territory .
They say that they wish to stay the same for as long as possible and are willing to do whatever it takes for it .
Mr Justo Maranzano recently attended a book fair and was really surprised to see so many books related to horticulture there .
He really hopes that the future generations will be able to have the best of organic foods due to the improvement in technology despite millions of barriers .
Mr Justo Maranzano also loves to learn new languages and he does it with the watching anime online ( nonton anime online ) .
He recently gained command in the Indonesian language with the help of watching anime movies online .
Mr Justo Maranzano says that he is glad about the fact that first it mostly used to be the ones who did n’t attend the high school or sometimes even grade school who used to decide to become a part of the horticultural industry but now some of the most educated people are deciding to enter the same .
Back when Mr Justo Maranzano used to be younger , he loved to ride horses and he even bred them .
He misses that part of his life a lot , and perhaps he does misses it more than anything else .
Mr Justo Maranzano ’s most favorite tourism destination is the Island of Malta and Gozo .
He loves the melons , apricots and cherries there .
He prefers to wholesale the melons , apricots and cherries from nowhere else but the Island of Malta and Gozo .
He claims that there is a certain flavor to it which very few understand , fortunately , a lot of his regular wholesale customers do agree with him and buy a lot of those Maltese melons , cherries and apricots from his company .
Mr Justo Maranzano used to be an atheist before getting involved into the horticultural business , but since the very start of his days in the business , he started to notice how much , how often and how well the god helps the horticulturists .
Roughly about 40 % of his company ’s donations go to the religious organizations across Italy .
Mr Justo Maranzano never gets tired of repeating that how a wealthy oil company owner once offered a great amount of money to buy his business but he refused the offer .
He says that the amount he offered was perhaps more than what his company will ever be able to make .
Yet another domino in the RSA encryption scheme has fallen with the announcement Thursday that cryptographers have broken 768 - bit keys using the widely used public - key algorithm .
An international team of mathematicians , computer scientists and cryptographers broke the key though NFS , or number field sieve , which allowed them to deduce two prime numbers that when multiplied together generated a number with 768 bits .
The discovery , which took about two - and - a - half years and hundreds of general - purpose computers , means 768 - bit RSA keys can no longer be counted on to encrypt or authenticate sensitive communications .
More importantly , it means it 's only a matter of another decade or so - sooner assuming there 's some sort of breakthrough in NFS or some other form of mathematical factoring - until the next largest RSA key size , at 1024 bits , is similarly cracked .
The accomplishment was reached on December 12 .
" It 's an important milestone , " said Benjamin Jun , vice president of technology at security consultancy Cryptography Research .
" There 's indisputable evidence here that 768 - bit key are not enough .
It 's a pretty interesting way to close out a decade . "
The team managed to factor the 232 - digit number that RSA held out as a representative 768 - bit modulus from a now - obsolete challenge .
They spent half a year using 80 processors on polynomial selection .
Sieving took almost two years and was done on " many hundreds of machines " .
Using a single - core 2.2GHz AMD Opteron with 2GB RAM , sieving would have taken about 1,500 years , they estimated .
Factoring the 768 - bit key was " several thousand times harder " than factoring a 512 - bit one , a feat that was first performed in 1999 .
By contrast , factoring a 1024 - bit RSA modulus , will be about 1,000 times harder than this most recent milestone .
That 's more than five times easier than a 768 - bit RSA modulus looked just a decade ago .
" If we are optimistic , it may be possible to factor a 1024 - bit RSA modulus within the next decade by means of an academic effort on the same limited scale as the effort presented here , " authors of the research wrote .
" From a practical security point of view this is not a big deal , given that standards recommend phasing out such moduli by the end of the year 2010 . "
But Nate Lawson , a cryptographer who is principal of security consultancy Root Labs , said smaller keys continue to be used for a variety of purposes , often by smaller embedded devices that do n't have the processing power to handle larger keys .
The research team includes Thorsten Kleinjung , Arjen K. Lenstra , Joppe W. Bos and Dag Arne Osvik of EPFL IC LACAL , in Lausanne , Switzerland ; Kazumaro Aoki of NTT , in Tokyo ; Jens Franke of the University of Bonn 's Department of Mathematics ; Emmanuel Thomé , Pierrick Gaudry , Alexander Kruppa and and Paul Zimmermann of France ; and Peter L Montgomery , Herman te Riele and Andrey Timofeev of Microsoft .

Even though Collins is now director of the National Institutes of Health , the love of Jesus is still welling up inside him like an oil well that ca n’t be capped .
He ’s now emitted another gusher .
I was under the impression that when Collins came aboard as NIH director , he was going to give up the public religious proselytizing , or at least his penchant for telling everyone the Good News : science proves the existence of God .
I was wrong .
Collins has just issued a new edited volume , Belief : Readings on the Reason for Faith ( HarperCollins , release date Mar. 2 ) .
Here ’s the publisher ’s description :
“ Is there a God ? ” is the most central and profound question that humans ask .
With the New Atheists gaining a loud voice in today ’s world , it is time to revisit the long - standing intellectual tradition on the side of faith .
Francis Collins , New York Times bestselling author of The Language of God and renowned physician and geneticist , defends the reason for faith in this provocative collection .
Collins is our guide as he takes us through the writings of many of the world ’s greatest thinkers — philosophers , preachers , poets , scientists — both past and present , including such luminaries as C. S. Lewis and Augustine , and unexpected voices such as John Locke and Dorothy Sayers .
Despite the doubts of a cynical world , this essential companion proves once and for all the rationality of faith .

Francis Collins , New York Times bestselling author of The Language of God and renowned physician and geneticist , defends the reason for faith in this provocative collection .
Collins is our guide as he takes us through the writings of many of the world ’s greatest thinkers — philosophers , preachers , poets , scientists — both past and present , including such luminaries as C. S. Lewis and Augustine , and unexpected voices such as John Locke and Dorothy Sayers .
Despite the doubts of a cynical world , this essential companion proves once and for all the rationality of faith .
It ’s a bit disconcerting to hear that he ’s going to prove , through the lucubrations of C. S. Lewis (! ) and others , that faith is rational .
This implies that we faithless are the irrational ones , but also that Collins continues to blur the line between science and faith .
Well , this all might be publisher ’s hype , but it is n’t .
It continues in Collins ’s introduction , which you can read here :
Faith and reason are not , as many seem to be arguing today , mutually exclusive .
They never have been .
The letter to the Hebrews in the New Testament defines faith as “ the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen . ”
Evidence !
Down through the centuries , humanity ’s greatest minds have developed interesting and compelling arguments abouth faith , based on moral philosophy , arguments about nature , and examination of sacred texts .
But outside of limited academic circles , these deeper perspectives are not heard from much these days .
The goal of this anthology is to present some of these points of view , to spur on a more nuanced and intellectually rich discussion of the most profound questions that humanity asks :
Is there a God ?
If so , what is God like ?
Does God care about me ?
And what , if anything , is the meaning of life ?
Uh oh .
“ Evidence ” , with an exclamation mark !
What is the evidence ?
As I began to absorb the arguments [ of C. S. Lewis ! ] , the door to the possibility of God began to open , and as it did I began to see that the signposts had been around me all along .
Some of the evidence derived from nature itself .
As a scientist , I was then and am now deeply invested in the idea that nature is ordered , and that science can discover it .
But it never occurred to me to ask why order exists .
Going even deeper , I had never really considered the most profound philosophical question of all — why is there something instead of nothing .
And if there are realities called matter and energy that behave in certain ways , what about those mathematical equations I had been so in love with as a student of quantum mechanics — why should they work at all ?
What , to use Nobel Laureate Wigner ’s classic phrase , accounts for the “ unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics ” ?
Could this be a pointer toward a mathematical mind behind the universe ?
And then there was the Big Bang . . . .
If you ’ve read Collins ’s The Language of God , you already know where he ’s going .
To posit a creator that is also part of nature provides no solution .
Instead , one seems obligated [ my emphasis ] to yield to the logic of the cosmological argument ( called Kalam by Islamic scholars ) that there was a First Cause , a supernatural Creator outside of the laws of nature , and outside of time and space .
Yes , it ’s all scientific , folks .
Logic and scientific evidence says that we must — we must — accept a supernatural creator .
The rest follows predictably .
Collins brings up the “ fine - tuning ” of the universe ( “ The conclusion is astounding : if any of these [ physical constants ] were to vary by even the tiniest degree , a universe capable of sustaining any imaginable form of life would be impossible . ” )
God of the gaps !
Fine - tuning , therefore Jesus .
Collins is not a man who can live with doubt , with the idea that perhaps there is some deeper physical theory ( or , indeed , the possibility of multiple universes ) that might explain this “ fine - tuning . ”
And of course , we can get more scientific evidence for God from “ The Moral Law ” :
When we break this Moral Law . .
. we make excuses , only further demonstrating that we feel bound by the law in our dealings with others .
How can this be accounted for ?
If God actually exists , and has an interest in humans — a unique species with gifts of consciousness , intelligence , and free will — would n’t the existence of this law , written on all our hearts , be an interesting signpost toward a holy and personal God ?
“ Interesting signpost ” ?
What he means , of course , is “ EVIDENCE ” !
Responding to the argument that morality could have evolved , since we see apparent rudiments of morality in our primate relatives , Collins simply asserts that evolution could n’t lead us to admire altruists , or to perform altruistic acts ourselves .
Well , maybe , but reciprocal altruism could have evolved in small groups of interacting hominids .
And there are many people , including myself , who think that morality comes from a combination of an evolved mentality and a non-evolved , social extension of that mentality to other people — indeed , to other species .
( That ’s the point of Peter Singer ’s The Expanding Circle . )
Collins claims that the New Atheists have n’t dealt with the subtleties of theology , but he surely has not dealt with the multifarious arguments for the secular development of morality .
And while he claims he ’s “ not arguing that the existence of the Moral Law somehow proves God ’s existence , ” that ’s disingenuous .
He is , and he has done .
For myself , the arguments from the nature of the universe and the existence of the Moral Law led me , with considerable initial resistance , to a serious consideration of the possibility of a God who not only wound up the clock but who also has an enduring interest in a relationship with humans .
Enough is enough .
Collins is director of the NIH , and is using his office to argue publicly that scientific evidence — the Big Bang , the “ Moral Law ” and so forth — points to the existence of a God .
That is blurring the lines between faith and science : exactly what I hoped he would not do when he took his new job .
And to those who say that he has the right to publish this sort of stuff , well , yes he does .
He has the legal right .
But it ’s not judicious to argue publicly , as the most important scientist in the US , that there is scientific evidence for God .
Imagine , for example , the outcry that would ensue if Collins were an atheist and , as NIH director , published a collection of atheistic essays along the lines of Christopher Hitchens ’s The Portable Atheist , but also arguing that scientific evidence proved that there was no God .
He would , of course , promptly be canned as NIH director .
Or imagine if Collins were a Scientologist , arguing that the evidence pointed to the existence of Xenu and ancient “ body - thetans ” that still plague humans today .
Or a Muslim , arguing that evidence pointed to the existence of Allah , and of Mohamed as his divine prophet .
Or if he published a book showing how scientific evidence pointed to the efficacy of astrology , or witchcraft .
People would think he was nuts .
Collins gets away with this kind of stuff only because , in America , Christianity is a socially sanctioned superstition .
He ’s the chief government scientist , but he wo n’t stop conflating science and faith .
He had his chance , and he blew it .
He should step down .
President Barack Obama will speak during Republicans ' retreat in Baltimore this month .
Obama to address House GOP
President Barack Obama will address House Republicans next week at their annual retreat in Baltimore , deputy White House press secretary Bill Burton said Tuesday afternoon .
It ’s a show of bipartisanship after a year rife with tumult in the relationship between the president and the minority in the House .
House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio , House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia and House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana have taken swipes at nearly every one of the White House ’s priorities — ranging from sweeping health care overhaul to stimulus legislation .

Obama will address House Democrats during their policy retreat in Washington on Thursday , then he ’ll travel to Baltimore to speak to House Republicans next week .
It ’s not clear what will be on the agenda , but these retreats are usually reserved for planning out the year ’s legislative agenda .
But even as news emerged that Obama will speak to House Republicans , Cantor took a jab at the president .
On rare occasions when Republicans were invited to the White House , Cantor said , Republicans were paid “ lip service while the cameras were on , only to completely rebuff those ideas afterward . ”
“ It is important to ask whether the president plans to meet with Republicans , or speak to them , ” Cantor said in a statement .
BEIJING  Liu Xiaobo , one of China ’s most prominent advocates of democratic change , was tried Wednesday on charges of subversion , a sign that Chinese leaders are reducing their already limited tolerance for peaceful political dissent .
Mr. Liu , an essayist and social critic who has spent more than a year in detention , faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of charges legally defined as “ incitement to subvert state power . ”
His lawyer said a verdict in the closed trial was likely to be announced on Friday .
Charging one of the best - known dissidents with subversion is a disheartening milestone in the eyes of some Chinese legal experts and human rights advocates .
China has rarely brought political charges against people advocating peaceful dissent in recent years , though it often accuses those who offend the authorities of other crimes , like tax evasion , leaking state secrets or violating business regulations .
Now , flush with record foreign exchange reserves and buoyed by the world ’s most resilient major economy , Chinese officials seem less hesitant to call a crackdown by its own name : the charge of subversion has now been brought against not only Mr. Liu but also Hu Jia , an AIDS activist and environmentalist , who was convicted of that crime last year and sentenced to three and a half years in prison .

Having sold 25 million copies of his Millennium trilogy , been named the biggest author in Europe and with a movie adaptation due out in the US and UK , 2010 is a big year for Stieg Larsson .
Or it would be if he had n't died suddenly in 2004 , before any of his books were published .
Normally when an author finds great success they are around to satisfy the curiosity of their readers .
A slew of Stieg Larsson biographies are due out this year
They do signings and interviews , explaining their influences and inspirations , and allow the reader to unpick the characters , themes and plots .
At the same time they let the general public establish whether they are interesting in themselves , or only because of their work .
So perhaps the fact Stieg Larsson died in 2004 , before the publication of his first book , explains the level of curiosity about his life .
The Swedish author 's thrillers have been a publishing sensation .
The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo [ Men That Hate Women , in Swedish ] , The Girl Who Played With Fire , and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets ' Nest [ The Castle in the Air That Blew Up , in Swedish ] feature Mikael Blomkvist , a principled investigative journalist , and Lisbeth Salander , an aloof , eccentric but brilliant young , female private investigator .
Larsson fans will know the author 's basic back story .
He was a left - wing journalist who started out as a graphic designer at a Swedish news agency before becoming a leading investigator of far - right political movements .
In his spare time - and at night when he could not sleep - he wrote novels .
SWEDISH CRIME WAVE Stieg Larsson , 26 million copies sold Henning Mankell , creator of Wallander ( pictured above ) Camilla Lackberg , sets thrillers in home town of Fjallbacka Jens Lapidus , lawyer and author of Stockholm Noir trilogy A Swedish publisher became interested in the spring of 2004 , and Larsson immediately delivered two manuscripts before finishing the last part of the trilogy in the summer .
He died of a heart attack a few months later at the age of 50 .
Released the next year , the first of the books was quickly a bestseller in Sweden and picked up elsewhere , generating millions for the Larsson estate .
The distribution of the estate generated headlines , with it widely reported that his partner Eva Gabrielsson , who Larsson never married but spent three decades with , would not be entitled to a penny because there was no valid will .
Instead , his father and brother are the legal heirs .
And as well as his financial legacy , there is a battle over the personality of Larsson himself with a slew of biographies due out this year , perhaps to coincide with the release of a Swedish film adaptation in the UK and US in March .
Kurdo Baksi , who worked with Larsson on the anti-fascist magazine Expo , and who had known him since 1992 , has just released a book entitled My Friend Stieg Larsson .
His suggestion that Larsson was not a leading light of journalism has proved controversial in Sweden .
" Many people are angry , " says Baksi .
" He is a god in Sweden . "
Lisbeth Salander is a socially distant investigator with a photographic memory
But the controversy over Baksi's book may be dwarfed by the storm generated by another old colleague of Larsson .
Anders Hellberg believes there is no way Larsson could have written the prose in the Millennium trilogy .
He worked with Larsson at the TT news agency in the late 1970s and early 1980s when Larsson was a designer .
He edited the text that Larsson produced to go alongside graphics and he was not impressed .
" This was not professional writing .
Everything was wrong , the order of the words , the syntax - it was not professional language .
POSTHUMOUS FAME Singer Eva Cassidy died in relative obscurity in Maryland in 1996 , but was made famous in the UK after being played on the Terry Wogan show Little regarded in his lifetime , retrospectives of the work of Vincent van Gogh after his death in 1890 as well as the publication of his letters with brother Theo helped create his fame When Nick Drake died in 1974 , the music industry paid little attention , but his three albums were cited increasingly by other musicians during the 1980s and he is now well known " To write is a kind of talent .
You can learn up to a certain level to write .
Stieg in my view could not have written the novels . "
Hellberg , who made his revelations in an article in Sweden 's leading newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Friday , does not know for certain who else may have written the novels , but he said it might be plausible to suggest Larsson 's partner Ms Gabrielsson , an architect , played a big part .
" Stranger things have happened than two people [ where ] one does the plot , the research , the story and the other one is writing .
She has written a lot in underground papers .
She is a very good writer , I 've been told . "
There is no evidence that Ms Gabrielsson did any of the writing , admits Hellberg .
It has been suggested that her contribution to the work was proofreading and assistance on description of architectural detail .
But it is not clear why , if Ms Gabrielsson was responsible for more , she would not have already made it clear .
Her forthcoming book may make her position on the matter clearer .
Ms Gabrielsson was unavailable for comment .
Hellberg has also been on the receiving end of fan ire for his theory .
Mikael Blomkvist is a principled investigative journalist " The reaction from my fellow Swedes and also some others is quite angry .
Normal Stieg Larsson readers do n't like this .
I 've committed some kind of crime to raise the question .
Some of the mail is not pleasant . "
The idea that Larsson could n't write and therefore is not responsible for the prose in the trilogy is dismissed by others who knew him , like Anna - Lena Lodenius , who worked with him on a book about neo -Nazis in the early 90s .
" When we worked together he was n't that good in the beginning but that was a long time ago , " says Lodenius .
" If you read the books you can hear his voice .
It is like he is next to you .
It is his words , his expression .
You can hear it . "
She does not think it strange that someone with little track record of writing fiction could suddenly turn out a series of bestsellers .
" He read an enormous amount of crime stories and true crime .
He was very interested in female writers like Sara Paretsky [ who created the character of VI Warshawski ] .
" I was maybe a little bit surprised that he was able to write this kind of thriller , books that you can't put down .
He learnt by reading I think .
For me it 's quite obvious that he was a good writer . "
But it 's not obvious how Larsson would have coped with being the most famous man in Sweden .
Unprompted , the first adjective Baksi , Hellberg and Lodenius use to describe him is " shy " .
He was a sociable man , but not one who thrived when addressing a room full of strangers .
The stories are thrillers with obvious political undertones Baksi - who calls Larsson one of his best friends - describes him as " a little bit Pippi Longstocking , a little bit Dalai Lama " .
There is no doubt that there is interest in the idea of someone never living to see their fame .
The singer Eva Cassidy is a recent example .
There is a poignancy in having to simultaneously celebrate the arrival , and mourn the passing , of an artist .
But crime writer and critic Joan Smith says Larsson 's success is all about the books .
" When I first started reading the first one I was struck by how extraordinarily modern it was .
The second thing was he has an understanding of male violence towards women which is relatively unusual in crime fiction . "
Steven Murray , who translated the trilogy into English , says the political and moral undertone of the books - which touches on corruption in big business , the inadequacy of journalists , the legacy of Nazism , and violence against women - appeals to readers .
" They are addictively paced in spite of the many digressions , which most readers think just add to the appeal somehow .
And I believe the pervasive moral view adds something that is missing in most thrillers . "
Even without his untimely death in 2004 , Stieg Larsson 's story would still be remarkable .
A man , approaching middle age , and with no track record of writing fiction , knocks out a trilogy of thrillers , gets a publishing deal , but dies before being thrust into superstardom .
Below is a selection of your comments .
We are way behind Europe in this .
There 's not just one film but three , all released in Europe in 2009 .
The first film premiered in the UK at the Cambridge Film Festival in September .
I guess we will get a dubbed version which is I think a real shame .
Deb , Reading I am surprised you did n't include John Kennedy Toole in your piece , wrote Neon Jesus aged 16 , then Confederacy of Dunces .
Neither were picked up .
He killed himself .
His mother took the books to a university professor in New Orleans and Toole received the Pullitzer posthumously , The Confederacy of Dunces being voted one of America 's ( and my ) favourite books .
Darren Smith , London
About time that some of the Scandinavian detective writers were recognised - one of my favourites is the Norwegian Jo Nesbø .
Both Nemesis and The Devil 's Star are well worth reading and check out Missing by Karin Alvtegen another Swedish writer .
This book won the Glass Key , the Nordic literature award for best crime fiction .
Humphrey Stephenson , Horsham , West Sussex
While his books are an entertaining read , and Lisbeth Salander is a great character , they 're really quite badly written .
How much of that is down to bad translation , and how much is down to them needing a good editor is uncertain , but the author 's attempts to prove his nu-man feminist credentials are largely undermined by his adolescent and misogynistic sexual fantasies .
If anything , the guy claiming Larsson did n't write them is doing him a posthumous favour .
Andy H-L , Haywards Heath , UK
When I was paying for my newspapers I noticed this book next to the till .
Not sure why , but I picked it up and I could not put it down !
One of your feedback said " they 're really quite badly written " ... well , go and read William Shakespeare 's books .
Its all about imagination and I really enjoyed all 3 books and cant wait to see the films .
Andrea Kuvikova , Camberley I agree with Andy H - L .
The books could do with a half decent editor .
I do n't think it is just a translation issue - as the main weaknesses are in plot structure with two many chapters that could be dropped without changing the readers understanding of the story .
There is one chapter that is more or less just a list of purchases from Ikea : I 'd prefer to read the store catalogue , thanks .
It has to be said that Lisbeth Salander is a great creation - it is a shame she was not the editor , because a few back sides need kicking .
Roger C , Southampton
I 've read the first book in English and the second in Swedish and I do think that the translation is n't as good as it could have been .
There are many fine Scandinavian writers who I hope will get an audience because of Stieg Larsson 's success .
I 'm hopeful that an undubbed version of the films will be shown in the UK .
Sarah , Cambridge , UK Always the same is n't it ....
Especially when someone is sadly , safely dead for all the know - all vultures to descend on .
" He 's not that good really " , " Could n't have written it " and best of all " Badly written . "
I bet the authoritative non entities responsible for the comments below that article and jealous writers quoted wish they could write so badly .
The trilogy is wonderful , gripping stuff I just could n't put down and what a shame there are n't more .
Does everything enjoyable have to be micro analysed ?

Editor 's note : Elizabeth McAlister is a professor of religion at Wesleyan University .
( CNN ) --
We are all sick at heart to witness the unfathomable suffering in Haiti .
Why do bad things happen to innocent people ?
Why Haiti , again ?
Even Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said recently , " It is biblical , the tragedy that continues to stalk Haiti and the Haitian people . "
How we make meaning of this suffering will be crucial to how we respond , in the long term , as a global community .
My Haitian in - laws , visiting from Boston , Massachusetts , to take some comfort with us , announced that the verse of the day on their favorite Bible Web site is from Revelation 16:18 .
" And there were voices and thunders and lightnings ; and there was a great earthquake , such as has not been since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake and so great . "
The word " earthquake " appears sixteen times in the Bible .
It was clear to them -- and many other Christians -- that the earthquake was part of God 's plan .
Why God ordains such disasters is a mystery that is not ours to question .
It is only our job to have faith .
i Report : Looking for loves ones in Haiti
A friend who barely escaped the collapse of her house in the quake writes that people in her Port - au - Prince neighborhood are living this time as the apocalypse .
They are gathering en masse , singing hymns and praying nonstop as they wait for disaster aid -- and Jesus .
For them , the meaning of their suffering is clear .
How else to interpret the collapse of their entire world , earthquake , famine , death , disease and drought ?
They are God 's children living out the last chapter of the Bible .
Fundamentalist Pat Robertson says that the earthquake is the devil 's work .
Haitians are cursed by a pact with Satan that their ancestors made , he says .
Distorting a Haitian national myth , he is referring to a famous Afro - Creole religious service said to have sparked and launched the Haitian War of Independence in 1791 .
Ironically , historians tell us that such a single ceremony never happened -- although surely there were many slave gatherings , and many Afro - Creole religious rituals in the region .
Haitians do not mistake African religiosity for Satanism as Robertson does , so for them the ceremony was a spiritually charged political rally .
Slaves gathered to plan and inspire themselves for the outrageous feat they would succeed in performing : a slave revolution , the abolition of slavery , and by 1804 , national independence .
Afro -Creole religion , known as Vodou , still underpins the philosophy of many Haitians , though by no means everyone .
A spirit - priest I know reads the earthquake as an allegorical message from the spirits who infuse the land .
" The land is our mother , " he said .
When you abuse the land -- deforest her , plant only one crop , overpopulate her , erode her soil -- she explodes , searching for a way to rebalance .
The spirit of the land had become sick with abuse .
Her children -- the eldest ones , the ones in charge , the Haitian government -- had no policies , no laws to protect the land or use it wisely .
The spirit - mother exploded with fever .
" We know this has a scientific cause , " said the spirit - priest .
" But look how the government buildings caved in .
This tells us something . "
In the last several years there has been a saying among Haitians that " the country is finished . "
" Peyi-a fini , " they say in Creole .
It has been called a dying land , a failed state , a product of irreversible environmental degradation .
For social scientists , there is nothing metaphysical about the question " Why Haiti ? "
Longstanding structural reasons have produced a dysfunctional system long in crisis .
Beginning as a French slave society , the nation was founded at a severe disadvantage .
France demanded enormous payment for abandoned property after the revolution , starting a cycle of debt that was never broken .
Deep and abiding racism prevented the U.S. and Europe from recognizing Haiti for 60 years .
Trade was never established on even terms .
The military ruled the state , culminating in the brutal Duvalier dictatorship , which the U.S. supported .
No robust civil society developed -- there 's no vigorous tradition of PTAs and town planning boards .
A brain drain evacuated top talent from the country , while the U.S. - subsidized farm industry sent surplus crops to Haiti , undercutting local prices there .
Farmers abandoned their lands , flocked to the capital , and built the shanty towns that have now collapsed into rubble , burying the innocent and vulnerable , strong and powerful alike .
The suffering Haitians are enduring is a natural disaster worsened by human - made conditions .
It is a spiritual crucible .
But it is also a crisis of meaning .
For Christians it is to have faith , hope , and charity .
For fundamentalist Protestants , it is to convert all souls , give aid , and wait for Jesus ' return .
For Vodouists , it is to regain balance with the land and the unseen spiritual world .
For many social scientists , it is to strengthen Haitians ' capacity for self - government , to relieve the debt Haiti owes , to reforest the land , and to figure out how to divorce aid from dependence .
How we interpret the suffering of the good people of Haiti will lay the groundwork for how we walk forward .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elizabeth McAlister .
The Orwellian - named mercenary trade group , the International Peace Operations Association , did n’t waste much time in offering the “ services ” of its member companies to swoop down on Haiti for some old fashioned humanitarian assistance disaster profiteering .
Within hours of the massive earthquake in Haiti , the IPOA created a special web page for prospective clients , saying : “ In the wake of the tragic events in Haiti , a number of IPOA ’s member companies are available and prepared to provide a wide variety of critical relief services to the earthquake ’s victims . ”
While some of the companies specialize in rapid housing construction , emergency relief shelters and transportation , others are private security companies that operate in Iraq and Afghanistan like Triple Canopy , the company that took over Blackwater ’s massive State Department contract in Iraq .
For years , Blackwater played a major role in IPOA until it left the group following the 2007 Nisour Square massacre .
In 2005 , while still a leading member of IPOA , Blackwater ’s owner Erik Prince deployed his forces in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
Far from some sort of generous gift to the suffering people of the US gulf , Blackwater raked in some $ 70 million in Homeland Security contracts that began with a massive no -bid contract to provide protective services for FEMA .
Blackwater billed US taxpayers $ 950 per man per day .
The current US program under which armed security companies work for the State Department in Iraq — the Worldwide Personal Protection Program — has its roots in Haiti during the Clinton administration .
In 1994 , private US forces , such as DynCorp , became a staple of US operations in the country following the overthrow of Jean Bertrand Aristide by CIA - backed death squads .
When President Bush invaded Iraq , his administration radically expanded that program and turned it into the privatized paramilitary force it is today .
At the time of his overthrow in 2004 , Aristide was being protected by a San Francisco - based private security firm , the Steele Foundation .
What is unfolding in Haiti seems to be part of what Naomi Klein has labeled the “ Shock Doctrine . ”
Indeed , on the Heritage Foundation blog , opportunity was being found in the crisis with a post titled : “ Amidst the Suffering , Crisis in Haiti Offers Opportunities to the U.S. ”
“ In addition to providing immediate humanitarian assistance , the U.S. response to the tragic earthquake in Haiti earthquake offers opportunities to re-shape Haiti ’s long - dysfunctional government and economy as well as to improve the public image of the United States in the region , ” wrote Heritage fellow Jim Roberts in a post that was subsequently altered to tone down the shock doctrine language .
The title was later changed to : “ Things to Remember While Helping Haiti . ”
There are always rules and regulations to be followed at all times when there are procedures implemented .
It would be ideal to go on in this way to take it on and let it go for the best of the outcomes .
This is on behalf of what is able to go on in this manner to get the real deal in hand .
The termination of any kind of employee should have a proper solution on …

Somewhere in the Sierra Nevada , a granite terrace the size of a football field holds hundreds of mysterious stone basins representing what geologists believe is one of the earliest known " factories " created and used by ancient Miwok Indians to make tons of salt to trade with tribes up and down California .
James G. Moore , a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park , learned of the strangely pitted terrace from detailed maps made more than a century ago and hiked the region in May to study what he determined were clearly hand - hewn objects .
He examined 369 of the circular artifacts only a few yards from two streams of saltwater fed by a nearby spring and a lake that was equally salty .
Moore and his colleague at the USGS , Michael F. Diggles , believe the circular basins were handmade by the Miwok people in an impressive display of early technology .
They have published a detailed account of their findings in an official Geological Survey report , but because the area is now an " archaeologically sensitive " site and its location protected by law , Moore is permitted only to say that the basins are in a canyon somewhere within the Stanislaus National Forest .
" This is quite likely to give us new insights into the lives of the Miwok people in the Sierra , " said Kent G. Lightfoot , a UC professor of anthropology and a specialist in the history and culture of California 's Native Americans .
Creating the basins
Records show that early American Indians , including the Miwok people , lived for thousands of years as hunter - gatherers in that area of the Sierra , Moore said , and it is filled with evidence of old settlements , with abundant middens , arrowheads and small stone tools .
But learning how long ago the basins were carved awaits high - tech dating .
The basins average more than a yard in diameter and are more than 2 feet deep .
To create them , Moor and Diggles said , Miwok tribe members built fires on the granite surface that heated the stone until it fractured .
They then crumbled and pounded the fractures with stone tools and removed the debris , inch by inch , until the basins were formed .
Diggles estimated it took Miwok workers nearly a year to complete a single one .
He calculated that each fire used to dig a single layer of rock deepened the granite by no more than a centimeter .
The process , he said , must have been repeated 100 times to make a single basin .
Similar granite basins were discovered in 1891 by Henry W. Turner , a geologist exploring California 's mountains in what is now Sequoia National Park , Moore said in the Geological Survey report .
Moore has examined those , too .
" I think of them as the Machu Picchu of North America , " Moore said .
Machu Picchu is the ancient city of stone in the Peruvian Andes , abandoned by the Incas nearly 500 years ago .
3 tons of salt a year
Salt springs are extremely rare in the Sierra Nevada , but Moore said the salt in the nearby streams probably comes from a layer of ancient marine sediment formed many millions of years ago when the area was covered by an ocean .
He said he believes the Miwok people carried water from the streams in watertight woven baskets , poured it into the basins and let it evaporate in the summer heat until the dry salt could be scooped out .
The salt content of the water and the rate of water flow indicate that the two streams probably yielded about 3 tons of salt each year , Moore said .
The people of the area , he said , " had a large and valuable surplus to trade with other tribes - an early example of commerce by hunter - gatherer people . "
Chemical analysis of the water also shows high levels of arsenic - 170 times higher than the maximum allowed in drinking water by the Environmental Protection Agency , he said .
It is unknown whether arsenic made its way into the salt .
" Salt was an important commodity for Native Americans , " UC Berkeley 's Lightfoot said .
" It is certainly possible that salt harvested from these basins could have been traded to other native groups in California and the Great Basin ( east of the Sierra ) .
" Further work will be needed to develop a solid chronology for the basins . "

The blowback from GoogleÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s threat to leave ChinaÃ‚Â continues to escalate like a hyper - ventilated episode of Law & Order .
Microsoft has just announced that it will issue an emergency patch — something it rarely does Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to staunch the Internet Explorer security hole implicated in recent data - stealing cyberattacks against Google , Adobe , Jupiter and dozens of other companies .
UPDATE : Microsoft has just announced that the patch will be released at 10 a.m. Pacific time , on Thursday , 21 Jan2009 .
Despite mounting evidence to the contrary , the software giant continues to downplay the extent to which this latest in a long , long line of IE zero - day vulnerabilities is being used in the wild well before a patch is available .
In this blog post , George Stathakopoulos , Microsoft ’s general manager trustworthy computing security , claims Microsoft has seen only Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ very limited , and in some cases , targeted attacksÃ¢â ‚
¬Â linked to this IE zero - day flaw .
High urgency
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ To date , the only successful attacks that we are aware of have been against Internet Explorer 6 , Ã¢â‚ ¬
Â he says .
And yet Stathakopoulos , at the same time , has signaled Ã‚Â high urgency to get this patch out and widely installed .
Microsoft is not waiting until it ’s next Patch Tuesday — Feb. 9 — the next scheduled date for issuing security updates .
And it is going public about the patch even before it has ascertained how long it will take to finish designing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and testing .
Stathakopoulos indicates that Microsoft wo n’t know until tomorrow , 20 Jan2010 , at the earliest , just how long it will take to finish up design and testing of the patch .
It is planning to issue a press release sometime on Wednesday revealing when the patch will be ready .
“ Quality assurance testing for ( an update to ) something as complicated as Internet Explorer is a gargantuan task , ” says Chet Wisniewski , security analyst at Sophos .
“ They need to make sure the patch does n’t break anything in Windows before they can release it . ”
This is all part of the fast - evolving fall - out of Google grabbing a high - level of public attention about an otherwise routine cyber espionage assault .
By threatening to pull out of China , Google has , for the moment , elevated the security discussion to a level that the problem warrants .
Plot thickens
Over the past nine days the plot has thickened at high velocity .
Here ’s a chronology :
6 p.m. EST , Ã‚Â Tuesday , 11Jan2010 .
Google issues a press release timed to miss the network TV news cycle .
The search giant says it Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ may wellÃ¢â‚ ¬Â leave China because of cyberattacks and censorship .
Thursday , 14Jan2010 .
McAfee discloses that Google and some 30 other companies were targeted by a spear phishing campaign , dubbed Operation Aurora .
The attackers tricked specific employees to click on a bad link , accessing a heretofore unknown security hole in IE6 , an older version of Microsoft ’s popular Web browser , to take over control of the PC .
Thursday , 14Jan2010 .
President Obama convenes 50 CEOs to hear him deliver a speech on modernizing government tech systems .
Among them : Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer , wearing a patriotic red - white - and - blue tie .
After ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s speech , CNBC reporter Maria Bartiromo appears to catch Ballmer a bit off guard in a live interview .
In the midst of a string of predictable questions , Bartimoro asks Ballmer about IE ’s complicity in the Google cyber attacks , as disclosed by McAfee just a few hours earlier .
Ballmer pauses slightly , thinking on his feet .
Ã‚Â
He tells Bartimoro : Ã‚Â
“ Cyber attacks and occasional vulnerabilities are a way of life .
If the issue is with us , we ’ll work through it with all of the important parties .
We have a whole team of people that responds very real time to any report that it may have something to do with our software , which we do n’t know yet . ”
Friday , 15 Jan2009 .
Metasploit researcher HD Moore reveals how the new , unpatched IE security flaw could be exploited on IE7 and IE8 , the latest versions of Microsoft ’s popular Web browser .
Moore , the mastermind behindÃ‚Â Month of Apple Bugs , is a self - styled good - guy hacker who believes in holding vendors ’ feet to the fire , forcing them to take full responsibility for security flaws in their commercially - sold products .
In this case , it worked .
“ Microsoft is afraid that if it only took researchers a day or two to figure this out , it will take the bad guys a couple more days to do the same thing , ” says Sophos analyst Wisniewski .
Friday , 15 Jan2010 , the German government issues a warning advising its citizens to find an alternative to Internet Explorer .
Monday , 18Jan2010 , the French and Australian government issue warnings not to use IE .
Tuesday , Ã‚Â 19Jan2010 .
Microsoft announces an IE patch is in the works .
Within an hour of MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s announcing the patch , Falguni Bhuta , communications manager , for Olso , Norway - based Opera Software contacts LastWatchdog to announce that downloads of its rival Opera Web browser has doubled in Germany and risen 35 percent in Australia .
“ Security issues continue to plague Internet Explorer users , and the latest recommendations from the German and French governments against using the browser are in line with what the security experts have been saying for years , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Â says Jan Standal , Opera ’s vice president of desktop products .

Code : su flash_image boot / sdcard / boot.img reboot
The original thread troubleshooting and creating this patch can be found here Kernel source for the boot.img I post here can be found here .
The patch is here Discussion on whether to include this in future Cyanogen Mods can be found here
By modifying the memory map in the kernel we are able to increase the amount of usable linux memory by 10 MB bringing the mapped LINUX ram to 110MB ( minus kernel used memory making it around 107MB ) .
The patch moves the ram console and framebuffer memory to SMI on chip and changes the GPU1 ram from 8 MB to 0MB .
GPU0 still has 7MB mapped in SMI so only 3D intensive applications and games seem to suffer after this patch .
The benefit is more RAM memory for linux to use .
Several people have reported system performance improvements at the sacrifice of 3D graphics applications .
Note : you will not see extra ram under in recovery since it uses it 's own ( unpatched ) kernel to boot .

As suggested by IConrad01 it is advisable to test a new boot.img before flashing it with :
Make a nandroid backup before installing or download the stock boot.img to go back .
Copy the boot.img to the root of your sdcard .
Then issue these commands from the terminal emulator .
ororObviously , there is still room for improvement with this patch .
Currently working on getting GPU1 RAM moved to SMI successfully and potentially accessing another 18 MB of RAM if the specs on EBI memory are correct ( 128 MB ) .
Any ideas ?
The Spanish cabinet has today passed legislation that will enable the authorities to shut down file - sharing sites more rapidly .
The new legislation gives in to the demands of the US and local copyright lobby , who see Spain 's lenient copyright law as a thorn in their side .
Operating a file - sharing oriented website without profiting directly from infringements falls within the boundaries of the law in Spain .
In an attempt to change this situation , the Spanish Government has today passed new legislation under which sites offering links to copyright works could be taken offline within days of a complaint .
Under the new law , a newly formed Intellectual Property Commission will file complaints with a judge , who will then have to decide within four days whether or not a site should be pulled offline .
The law is the result of an extensive lobby from the entertainment industries who have criticized Spain ’s lenient stance towards file - sharing sites .
The Government ’s plans have been met with firm opposition from the public .
Critics of the new legislation are outraged and argue that it represents a violation of individual Internet users ’ rights .
“ Copyright should not be placed above citizens ’ fundamental rights to privacy , security , presumption of innocence , effective judicial protection and freedom of expression , ” wrote a group of activists recently in a response manifesto on the rights of Internet users .
Initially , the proposed legislation would allow for the closure of file - sharing sites without a warrant or judicial oversight .
In the latest plans a judge does have to review the takedown request to guarantee that no fundamental rights are violated .
Although the new text has improved , there are still many critics who claim that no websites should be taken offline without going through all the judicial steps to actually confirm that they operate illegally .
Tomorrow , a group of bloggers , experts , and activists will meet in Madrid to coordinate actions to defend civil rights on the Internet .
Many feel that the new legislation has been fast - tracked after pressure from the US and local entertainment industry lobbyists , without carefully reviewing the implications it has for the public .
Happy peasants and miserable millionaires : Happiness research , economics , and public policy
Carol Graham
What measures of human wellbeing are the most accurate benchmarks of economic progress and human development ?
This column presents new research suggesting that while people can adapt to be happy at low levels of income , they are far less happy when there is uncertainty over their future wealth .
This may help explain why different societies tolerate such different levels of health , crime , and governance , and why US happiness plummeted during the global financial crisis but has since been restored despite incomes remaining lower .
Early economists and philosophers , such as Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham , were serious about the study of happiness .
Yet with the rise of quantitative methods in economics calling for more parsimonious definitions of welfare , happiness fell out of fashion , and utility became synonymous with income .
Over a century later , in the mid-1970s , Richard Easterlin revisited the relationship between happiness and income .
His findings uncovered what seemed to be a paradox ; average happiness levels did not increase over time as countries grew wealthier , nor was there a clear relationship between average per capita GDP and average happiness levels across countries , once they achieved a certain minimum level of per capita income .
This puzzle is known as the Easterlin paradox .
In recent years there has been a renewed debate about whether the Easterlin paradox holds , not least because an increasing number of economists have started to use happiness surveys to explore all kinds of questions .
Recent studies by Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers , and by Angus Deaton , based on new data from the Gallup World Poll , find a consistent log-linear , cross-country relationship between income and happiness , directly challenging Easterlin ’s findings ( see Stevenson and Wolfers 2008 , and Deaton 2008 ) .
This has resulted in a heated and , at times , even acrimonious debate among economists .
Two right answers
Rather ironically , both sides of the debate may be correct .
There are two reasons why :
One reason is substantive .
On the one hand , it makes sense that people in richer countries are happier than those in destitute ones , whereas on the other hand , many things other than income contribute to people ’s happiness , regardless of their level of income .
Many of these things – like freedom , stable employment , and good health – are easier to come by in wealthier countries .
Still , there is plenty of variance in the availability of these things even across countries with comparable income levels .
The other reason is methodological .
The later studies use new data from the Gallup World Poll , which includes many more ( un- weighted ) observations from small poor countries in Africa and from the transition economies than did Easterlin ’s original studies ( as well as his more recent ones ) .
The transition countries in particular have relatively low levels of happiness , in part as a result of happiness levels falling markedly with the painful structural changes that accompanied the collapse of centrally planned economies .
Meanwhile , some of the sub -Saharan African countries have had flat or even negative rates of growth over time .
Thus rather than a story of higher levels of income pulling up happiness at the top , it may be one of falling or volatile income trajectories pulling down happiness at the bottom .
How happy are you with your life ?
There are also differences in the questions that are used to measure happiness .
Easterlin ’s work is based on the World Values survey , the US General Social Survey , and the Eurobarometro survey , among others , all of which use open - ended happiness or life satisfaction questions .
Generally speaking , these questions ask , “ how happy are you with your life ? ” or “ how satisfied are you with your life ? ” , with possible answers ranging from “ not at all ” to “ very ” on a 4 or 5 point scale .
The Gallup World Poll uses Cantril ’s best possible life question , which is “ please imagine a ladder with steps from zero to ten , if the higher the step , the best possible life , on which step of the ladder to you personally feel you stand ? ”
Both sets of questions are reasonable gauges of happiness , broadly defined , and both correlate in a similar manner with the usual variables .
Research based on all of these questions finds that , on average , stable marriage , good health , and enough income are good for happiness ( with how much income is enough varying across countries ) , and that unemployment , divorce , and economic instability are bad for happiness .
Age and happiness have a remarkably consistent U - shaped relationship , with the turning point in the mid to late forties , at which point happiness increases with age , as long as health and partnerships stay strong .
Indeed , I have studied this relationship in countries as diverse as the UK , Chile and Afghanistan , and it holds in all of them , with modest differences in the turning point .
Among other things , this relationship reflects an alignment of expectations and reality as people “ grow up ” .
At the same time , there is some variance in the findings based on different questions .
The best possible life question is more framed than the open - ended happiness questions , providing respondents with a relative component when they are asked to assess their lives .
Mario Picon , Soumya Chattopadhyay , and I tested the questions against each other in the Gallup World Poll for Latin America , a region for which we had both sets of questions in the same survey .
We found that the answers to the best possible life question correlate more closely with income – both across and within countries – than open - ended happiness questions ( Graham , Chattopadhyay , and Picon in Diener et al. forthcoming ) .
The difference is greater across countries than within them .
Thus , simply due to methodology – what sample of countries and which happiness questions are used – it is possible to come to different conclusions about the Easterlin paradox .
The substantive question of what – beyond income – makes people happy is an additional and more complicated part of the story .
Figure 1 presents findings from my previous research with Stefano Pettinato , based on an open - ended happiness question and a very simple linear specification of income .
While the richer countries are , on average , happier than the poorer ones , there is no clear income and happiness relationship within each set of countries , making it impossible to draw a clear conclusion about the Easterlin paradox .
The figure drums home the point that wealthier countries are , on average , happier than destitute ones , but after that , the story becomes more complicated .
Country level averages are influenced , among other things , by cultural differences in the way that people answer surveys , and these cannot be controlled for in the cross country comparisons in the way they are when we assess happiness across large samples of individuals within and across countries .

New research on people ’s capacity to adapt
My more recent research on happiness around the world throws another monkey wrench into the equation ( see Graham 2010 ) .
While the research confirms the stable patterns in the determinants of happiness worldwide , it also shows that there is a remarkable human capacity to adapt to both prosperity and adversity .
Thus , people in Afghanistan are as happy as Latin Americans – above the world average – and Kenyans are as satisfied with their healthcare as Americans .
Crime makes people unhappy , but it matters less to happiness when there is more of it ; the same goes for both corruption and obesity .
Freedom and democracy make people happy , but they matter less when these goods are less common .
The bottom line is that people can adapt to tremendous adversity and retain their natural cheerfulness , while they can also have virtually everything – including good health – and be miserable .
One thing that people do have a hard time adapting to is uncertainty .
For example , my latest research , with Soumya Chattopadhyay and Mario Picon based on daily records of around 1,000 Americans from January 2008 , shows that average happiness in the US declined significantly as the Dow fell with the onset of the crisis .
Average happiness fell 11 % from 6.94 ( on an 11 point scale ) prior to the onset of the crisis , to a low of 6.19 on November 16 , 2008 .
Yet when the market stopped bottoming out and some semblance of stability was restored in late March 2009 , average happiness recovered much faster than the Dow .
By June 2009 it was higher than its pre-crisis level : 7.15 on June 21 - even though living standards and reported satisfaction with those standards remained markedly lower than they were prior to the crisis .
Once the period of uncertainty ended , people seemed to be able to return to previous happiness levels , while making do with less income or wealth ( see Figure 2 ) .

Best possible life ( happiness ) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average

Indeed , people seem to be better at adapting to unpleasant certainty than they are to uncertainty .
It is surely a good thing that most Americans have been able to adapt to the economic costs of the crisis and return to their natural happiness levels .
And even better that the average person in Afghanistan can maintain cheerfulness and hope despite the situation they live in .
While this capacity to adapt may be a good thing from the perspective of individual psychological welfare , it may also result in collective tolerance for conditions that would be unacceptable by most people ’s standards .
This may help explain why different societies tolerate such different norms of health , crime , and governance , both within and across countries .
Without understanding these norm differences , it is very difficult to craft policies to improve health , living conditions , and governance structures .
Happy peasants and miserable millionaires
This capacity to adapt – and the mediating role of norms and expectations – poses all sorts of measurement and comparison challenges , particularly in the study of the relationship between happiness and income .
Can we really compare the happiness levels of a poor peasant in India , who reports to be very happy due to low expectations or due to a naturally cheery character , with those of a successful and very wealthy CEO , who reports to be miserable – due to his or her relative rankings compared to other CEO ’s , or to a naturally curmudgeonly character ?
This is something that I have called the “ happy peasant and miserable millionaire problem ” ( or the happy peasant and frustrated achiever problem ) .
On one level it suggests that happiness is all relative .
On another it suggests that some unhappiness may be necessary to achieve economic and other sorts of progress .
The examples of migrants who leave their home countries – and families – to provide better futures for their children , or revolutionaries who sacrifice their lives for the broader public good , come to mind .
This also raises more difficult questions , such as whether we should tell a poor peasant in India how miserable they are according to objective income measures in order to encourage that peasant to seek a “ better ” life ; or whether we worry more about addressing the millionaire ’s misery or increasing the peasant ’s happiness .
This happy peasant and miserable millionaire paradox also raises the question of the appropriate definition of happiness .
What makes happiness surveys such a useful research tool is their open - ended nature .
The definition of happiness is left up to the respondent , and we do not impose a US conception of happiness on Chinese respondents , or a Chinese definition on Chilean ones .
The open - ended nature of the definition results in the consistent patterns in the basic explanatory variables across respondents worldwide , in turn allowing us to control for those variables and explore variance in the effects of all sorts of other things on happiness , ranging from crime rates to commuting time to the nature of governing regimes .
Fulfilment or contentment ?
At the same time , as we think about happiness as a measure of welfare with relevance to policy – something that is increasingly in the public debate – then the definition does matter .
Are we thinking of happiness as contentment in the Benthamite sense , or as a fulfilling life in the Aristotelian sense ?
There is still much room for debate .
My studies of happiness around the world suggest that respondents ’ conceptions of happiness vary according to their norms such as expectations and ability to adapt .
Our priors as economists and policymakers likely suggest that some conceptions of happiness – such as the opportunity to lead a fulfilling life – are worth pursuing as policy objectives , while others – such as contentment alone – are not .
Yet that choice entails normative judgements and a debate which we have not yet had .
At the very least , this conundrum will give economists food for thought – about happiness and income , and beyond – for several years to come .
Moreover , despite the difficulty it poses for both method and economic philosophy , it will also force us to think deeply about what measures of human well being are the most accurate benchmarks of economic progress and human development .

The " underpants bomber " has renewed calls for new and more invasive security measures .
Already , there 's a push to install scanners that show travelers ' naked bodies through clothing , using either millimeter wave or backscatter X - ray imaging .
But even those scanners might not have caught the terrorist who nearly brought down Northwest flight 253 .
That 's why one company is trumpeting a sensor that can supposedly " detect substances such as explosive materials ... hidden inside or outside of the human body . "
First step : Actually build a human - sized machine .
There has already been one report of a suicide bomber carrying explosives internally .
Many sources , including the BBC , carried an early report suggesting that Abdullah Hassan Al Aseeri adopted the new tactic of " carrying explosives in his anal cavity " for an attack in September .
The target , a Saudi prince , survived , but Aseeri was reportedly blown in half by the blast .
Later reports suggest the explosives were actually sewn into his underwear , but security experts believe there is a real danger of " internally carried " bombs , a technique used for years by drug smugglers .
Nesch , a company based in Crown Point , Indiana , may have a solution .
It 's called diffraction - enhanced X - ray imaging or DEXI , which employs proprietary diffraction enhanced imaging and multiple image radiography ( .pdf ) .
Rather than simply shining X - rays through the subject and looking at the amount that passes through ( like a conventional X - ray machine ) , DEXI analyzes the X - rays that are scattered or refracted by soft tissue or other low - density material .
Conventional X - rays show little more than the skeleton , but the new technique can reveal far more , which makes it useful for both medical and security applications .
" Our patented technology can detect substances such as explosive materials , narcotics , and low - density plastics hidden inside or outside of the human body , " company CEO Ivan Nesch claims .
DEXI allows explosives to create contrast , he adds , so it would be able to detect both the underpants bomber and the shoe bomber before they boarded .
The image above shows how a conventional radiograph does not detect two packets of " illegal materials " concealed in soft tissue , while they are plainly visible in when DEXI technology is used .
The process of taking the images , analyzing them , and then recognizing substances of interest – such as explosives – can be automated .
Alerts issued can be computer - generated .
Security staff would simply have to get passengers in and out of the imaging unit .
" The initial expected throughput is approximately one to two passengers a minute , " according to Nesch .
" Once installed and tested in real applications , the throughput will be increased . "
Nesch has already demonstrated the technology with a unit originally designed for imaging small animals .
The next stage is a human - sized unit , which is being " finalized for extensive testing . "
Nesch plans to start taking orders for the new unitin March this year .
Of course , X - ray scanners always bring up a concern over the level of radiation involved .
One of Nesch 's corporate slogans is " Less radiation , more information , " as DEXI uses significantly less radiation than other approaches .
" It is far less than what a passenger would receive simply by flying on an airplane across the United States , " says Nesch .
" Passengers who are imaged using DEXI security will be exposed to approximately 50 times less radiation than that of a conventional radiograph . "
There is likely to be a ready market for the new technology .
Although an X - ray might be seen as more intrusive than an image of the outside of your body , it may be less controversial .
In Britain , plans for " naked body " scanners may run into trouble because they break British child pornography laws : Creating " indecent " images of children is illegal .
Those scans may also offend the modesty of some Muslims .
DEXI may be able to see into your body cavities , but it may be less obnoxious than some of the alternatives .

In crisis there usually is opportunity .
Now , here ’s the opportunity if the latest global financial - market upheaval worsens :
The U.S. government , still the borrower that never lacks for lenders , can launch a major economic - stimulus plan to be financed by yet more sales of Treasury securities .
Frightened global investors would again be happy to shovel their money into Treasuries at low - single - digit interest rates .
The U.S. would , in effect , then recycle those dollars back into the economy , preferably through business and personal tax cuts this time rather than another pork - barrel spending bill .
Real jobs would be created , finally putting the economy back on sound footing , boosting tax revenue and eventually paring the deficit .
Everybody wins !
The economic and fiscal policy of madmen ?
Maybe .
This is the deficits - are - good - for - you argument , which at this point sounds almost treasonous .
Have n’t we all embraced the idea that the U.S. faces certain ruin from its soaring debt ?
Baloney , says Marshall Auerback , an investment advisor who also is a member of the brain trust at the Roosevelt Institute .
He believes that the deficit hawks are dead wrong , and always have been .
The far greater risk to the economy , he and others in his camp assert , is that the Obama administration will cave in to calls for fiscal piety exactly at the moment when the economic recovery needs more oomph .
Of course , with the deficit projected at $ 1.6 trillion this fiscal year and $ 1.3 trillion the next , it hardly looks like Washington is exercising budgetary restraint .
Yes , the U.S. can borrow aggressively -- and it should , Auerback wrote this week on the blog of the Roosevelt Institute , a not - for - profit group that promotes the values of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt .
He has some esteemed company .
Joseph Stiglitz , the Nobel laureate economist , derides the critics of deficit spending as “ deficit fetishists ” who are ignoring what he believes is the clear and present danger of rampant unemployment .
“ The long - run cost of not addressing this issue is greater than the [ deficit ] cost imposed on our society by a long shot , ” Stiglitz said at a forum of business leaders who met at the White House in December .
The 50 - year - old Auerback takes deficit defense beyond even what many advocates of Keynesian government intervention support .
He really believes that deficit spending is always desirable .
I called him to ask how he could make that case , particularly given what has been happening in Greece , Portugal and Spain this week .
Investors , fearful of ballooning budget deficits in those nations , have sharply pushed up market interest rates on the countries ’ bonds .
That in turn helped trigger a heavy sell - off in European stocks Thursday that spread worldwide .
The British - born Auerback , who lives in Denver , is a portfolio strategist for money manager RAB Capital in London .
Besides his gig with the Roosevelt Institute , he is a consultant to bond fund titan Pimco in Newport Beach .
After working in money management for 27 years , Auerback says , he has increasingly become interested in government policy .
Not surprisingly , a main thrust of his deficit defense is that the U.S. , as the source of the world ’s reserve currency and the largest economy by far , retains financial flexibility that Greece , say , would never have .
The federal government can create money at will , and its spending “ is constrained only by what our population chooses as national goals , ” Auerback said .
Although foreign creditors such as China have become major buyers of U.S. debt , he notes that they ’ve obviously done so because it has served their purposes .
Auerback does n’t see why that should change any time soon , even though the Chinese grumble publicly about the level of U.S. borrowing .
Besides , government - bond investors prize liquidity , and that ’s still what Treasuries provide above all other bond markets .
It is n’t just hubris to say that , for the time being , the world does n’t have an alternative to the Treasury market .
As for the two most - cited fears about deficit spending -- that it will drive up inflation and interest rates -- Auerback points to the U.S. experience of the last 30 years :
The government spent more than it took in for mostly that entire period , yet inflation and rates remained in long - term decline .
Still , it does n’t seem far - fetched that foreigners could at some point decide the U.S. had become less creditworthy .
Pimco bond guru Bill Gross , among others , has warned that the country wo n’t hang on to its AAA credit rating forever .
Then what ?
Let ’s say investors decided to demand higher yields on Treasuries than the current paltry rates .
That would devalue older bonds issued at lower rates , but it also would make new Treasuries more attractive to investors .
Presumably many Americans who have no appetite for a five - year T - note paying 2.2 % might be very interested if the yield just got back to the 4.5 % level of 2007 .
As Auerback notes , because the government creates money , “ Debt owed by the government yields net income to the private sector , unlike all purely private debts , which merely transfer income from one part of the private sector to another . ”
Higher T - bond yields would cost the government more but also would pump more income into the economy , and could encourage more homegrown financing of the deficit .
The risk , however , is that higher Treasury yields would sharply drive up all other interest rates .
That could be deadly for housing , for example .
Another key risk is that the rising supply of deficit - generated dollars at some point could spark a currency crisis that would result in a rapid devaluation of the buck .
That would hurt Americans ’ purchasing power , but it also would put the country on sale for foreigners , which in theory should lure capital back .
It is n’t as if American assets have no value just because our national debt rises .
Besides , the dollar ’s appeal has to be judged against its main rivals -- and at the moment , it ’s hard to argue that the euro and the yen are more attractive .
Putting aside the questions of interest rates , inflation , currency values and other unknowns , the most compelling case Auerback can brandish against the deficit hawks is this :
To pare back government spending now , when the Treasury can borrow with ease , is to risk short - circuiting the global economic recovery for no good reason .
“ If your economy collapses , the deficit will go up inexorably , ” he said .
Auerback favors a temporary deficit - financed elimination or reduction of the Social Security payroll tax , which would boost income of both businesses and consumers .
Both Democrats and Republicans ought to be able to agree on that kind of stimulus , he said .
The most specious argument for slashing the deficit , Auerback contends , is that rising debt constitutes intergenerational theft because it burdens future generations .
If you want to commit intergenerational theft , he said , hack spending on education and other things that “ give our children and grandchildren the resources they need to compete ” in the future .
“ That is the true intergenerational theft . ”

Violent anti-Semitism has become increasingly commonplace in Sweden ’s southern city of Malmö , leading many Jewish residents to leave out of fear for their safety .
“ Threats against Jews have increased steadily in Malmö in recent years and many young Jewish families are choosing to leave the city , ” said Fredrik Sieradzki of the Jewish Community of Malmö .
Last year , 79 crimes against Jewish residents were reported to the Malmö police , roughly double the number reported in 2008 .
In addition , Jewish cemeteries and synagogues have been repeatedly defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti , and a chapel at another Jewish burial site in Malmö was firebombed last January during Operation Cast Lead in Gaza .
Many Jewish residents of Malmö feel that local anti-Jewish sentiment is linked with negative attitudes towards Israel .
In addition to its small community of roughly 700 Jews , Malmö is home to a growing Muslim population .
However , local Jews insist that the majority of anti-Jewish sentiment , although certainly existent in the Muslim community , is coming from local Swedes .
Sieradzki says that the attitudes of Malmö politicians , especially Social Democrat city council chair Ilmar Reepalu , have allowed anti-Semitism to fester .
“ He ’s demonstrated extreme ignorance when it comes to our problems , ” Sieradzki explained .
“ It ’s shameful and regrettable that such a powerful politician could be so ignorant about the threats we face .
“ If you read between the lines , he seems to be suggesting that the violence directed toward us is our own fault simply because we did n’t speak out against Israel .
We ’re a non-political , cultural and religious organization , and there are all kinds of Jews in Malmö . ”
Sieradzki admitted his pessimism about the future of the Jewish community in Malmö , saying that there needs to be a “ complete change in attitude ” among the city ’s politicians if the situation is going to improve .
“ These issues need to be taken seriously , ” he said , advocating for dialogue between politicians , Islamic groups and the Jewish community .
“ But right now many Jews in Malmö are really concerned about the situation here and do n’t believe they have a future here . ”

Sound like a dream come true ?
It can all be yours with this Beginner ’s How - To on Taking Over the World .
Chapter One : Playing Both Ends Against the Middle
The most essential component of any strategy of world domination is the misdirection of concerned citizens with regard to critical issues .
Nobody wants to hear that the man to whom they are submitting is going to destroy civilization and make everyone miserable .
Yet they know , in fact , that this is exactly what is happening .
Would - be dictators must use this to their advantage !
Take the somewhat politically educated , the moderately concerned , and split them in half .
Draw a false dichotomy between two equally reprehensible ideas and convince each side that the other ’s plan is the reason the world is going to hell .
While they argue Left vs. Right , take them towards Totalitarian .
Use their desire to avoid corrupt politicians and bad laws to increase your own power at their expense .
This principle is golden , and very widely implemented !
Oil companies have refined it to a science .
They have worked with Congress to orchestrate a brilliant and hostile takeover of the world economy .
To start , they sold high - quality products at competitive prices , causing them to accumulate substantial wealth quickly .
Then , they changed tactics radically .
They hopped on board a public outcry about the environmental damage done by drilling for oil , and so managed to negotiate highly agreeable legislation which made it completely impossible for start - up companies to obtain the paperwork to drill .
Congress looked good for saving the whales .
With potential competition eliminated , the oil companies began to raise their prices , decrease the quality of their service , and make extraordinary profits .
As these prices really hurt consumers , it was no surprise what the next step would be : Congress would have to step in to give the oil companies a good thrashing .
Nobody is quite sure exactly what they did or how it was supposed to help , but the result ultimately was that we have even fewer oil companies now than before and gas prices are still high .
The CEOs are laughing their way to the bank , Congressmen keep getting re-elected for passing stupid laws , and no ordinary person is actually better off for it – but rest assured we all have our opinions about whether the oil companies or the regulations are at fault .
Union leaders are also experts at playing both ends against the middle .
On the heels of the Industrial Revolution , Americans experienced prosperity and wealth like the world had never known .
There was an explosion of job opportunities and a dramatic increase in the real value of wages .
However , the rapid growth outpaced information transfer , and that left many people uninformed and unable to get the most for their labor .
To ensure that every worker was well - educated on what sort of working conditions he could expect and how well he ought to be paid for his time , workers unionized , meaning that they chose to pay dues to an organization which represented them in employer - employee negotiations to argue on their behalf .
Because this all makes perfect sense , cue Congress – to come in and decide things are going too damn well .
Nobody needed coercion and legal battles to make the world a happier place , which conflicted with their desire to rule the world .
Their response was to declare that unions and companies were incapable of negotiating fairly to agreeable conclusion , and that the only way to satisfactorily end disputes was through government intervention .
Thus they created anti-trust laws while simultaneously using police forces to break up strikes , and , in doing so , they made it dangerous to be a successful company or a conscientious group of workers .
This might seem like a bad PR move , but it was absolutely ingenious .
The irrelevant - but - totally - binding third - party arbitration these laws created led to a deterioration of working conditions , a rise in prices as a result of inefficiencies , and a blossoming legal department in every major company .
This gave the union leaders the ultimate opportunity to step up – and further their cause by declaring that industrialist malpractice , rather than Congressional interference , was the cause of the world ’s problems .
The unions informed the public that innocent workers were being subjected to horrible conditions and there was nothing they could do about it – except lobby Congress .
Now we see the brilliance of the Congressional plan , for it is those same Congressmen that broke a working system in the first place who rushed to fix it , by tightening anti-trust laws and – you guessed it – forcing more disputes to court arbitration .
The tremendous legal costs associated with arbitration roll over into prices levied against consumers , and the government sponsorship of unions makes it difficult for non-unionized workers to avoid penalties .
The union leaders are laughing their way to the bank , Congressmen keep getting re-elected for passing stupid laws , and no ordinary person is actually better off for it – but rest assured we all have our opinions about whether the corporations or the unions are at fault .
One of the most profound examples of obscuring the course of action that most people want in favor of a constructed dichotomy is the alleged health care reform bill .
Americans can’t agree on whether medical insurance should be nationalized or not .
They ca n’t agree on whether mandatory 100 % acceptance rate should be enforced .
The interesting note , though , is that these are n’t the only issues considered – not even close .
Everyone knows , for example , that there ’s no sensible reason why Americans should n’t be able to buy insurance across state lines – but they can ’t .
Everyone knows that the tort system needs to be revised so that consumers ca n’t be forced to foot the bill for unreasonable lawsuits .
Everyone knows insurance contracts need to be enforced more rigidly so that claimants ca n’t be dismissed for irrelevant pre-existing conditions after they ’ve already bought insurance .
The consensus on this is universal among politically aware , working class or middle class citizens – which means just about everyone .
But those are n’t really the issues this bill addresses !
The Democrats are raving about how desperately this country needs to socialize insurance , and the Republicans are insisting that it does n’t , and nobody seems to care enough to fix the problems that we all know are problems , that we all agree on how to fix , and that could be easily fixed pretty quickly .
Nobody ’s fixing those because it would n’t increase Congressional power .
If this bill passes , Congress will have effectively granted itself a categorically new level of privacy invasion into the lives of every American citizen .
If the bill fails , insurance companies will continue to deny legitimate claims with impunity and charge obscene prices because of the reduced competition and hyper - regulation .
Whichever way it goes , one thing remains constant :
The insurance companies are laughing their way to the bank , Congressmen keep getting re-elected for passing stupid laws , and no ordinary person is actually better off for it – but rest assured we all have our opinions about whether the Democrats or the Republicans are at fault .
In summary , the clever dictator - in - training must understand from this chapter these general principles :
1 ) The Left believes the government defends people from corporations , the Right believes corporations are victimized by the government , but all ordinary people lose out when the government and corporations work together .
2 ) The most obvious problems do n’t get solved because they do n’t provide anything to run against , which is to say they do n’t involve a reason to increase power over others .
Coercive power comes from controversy , not harmony .
3 ) Never let people realize what they have in common .
Work constantly to prevent them from all waking up one day and not being able to remember why they hate each other .
If people partially agree and partially disagree on an issue , televise the parts where they disagree , not where they agree .
Turn “ reduce deficit spending ! ” into capitalism vs. socialism .
Turn “ stop making useless regulations ! ” into Republicans vs. Democrats .
Turn “ let me do what I want ! ” into gays vs. Christians .
Do n’t let people live and let live – if they do that , you wo n’t have any excuse to take over the world .
Guest post by David Archibald
In a presentation dated 22nd September , 2009 , Dr Svalgaard produced a graphic which can be interpreted to predict the timing of the Solar Cycle 24 maximum .
That presentation is available here : http://www.leif.org/research/Predicting%20the%20Solar%20Cycle.ppt
That graphic is reproduced with my annotation :
Dr Svalgaard annotated Altrock ’s orgininal figure with the red and aqua arrows .
What is significant is that the Solar Cycle 24 arrow is 15 years after the Solar Cycle 23 arrow .
With the maximum of Solar Cycle 23 in March 2000 , that line suggests that the Solar Cycle 24 maximum will be in 2015 .
With the timing of the next maximum established , we can compare the progression of the current minimum with the minimum that saw the beginning of the Maunder Minimum .
Makarov and Tlatov in 2000 included a figure from Kocharov 1995 .
That figure follows , with my annotation :
Tree rings from the Urals have more uses than just making hockey sticks .
Due to the paucity of sunspots in the Maunder Minimum ( 1645 – 1710 ) , C14 data provides the evidence for the presence of solar cycles and their length .
According to Makarov and Tlatov , solar cycles averaged 20 years long in the Maunder .
In Figure 2 above , solar minima are associated with higher C14 content and are on the top side of the graphic .
I have marked the solar minima with vertical blue lines .
The blue figures along the x axis are the length of the solar cycles from minimum to minimum in years .
To compare the start of the Maunder Minimum to our current day minimum , I have marked where the maximum of Solar Cycle 24 would be in 2015 as 15 years after the peak of the preceding cycle .
There is also a parallel in the way that the C14 count ( reflecting the neutron flux and in turn the GCR flux ) is climbing above the peaks of previous minima , as it is today with the Oulu neutron count .
Neutron count tends to peak a year after solar maximum , so a neutron peak in 2010 is consistent with solar minimum in 2009 .
From Figure 2 , it can be expected that in a repeat of the Maunder Minimum , the neutron flux will remain well above the levels reached in the minima of the second half of the 20th century .
The Maunder Minimum was not completely devoid of sunspots , as shown by the following graphic using data from SIDC :
Lastly , the Heliospheric Current Sheet has flattened , one of the conditions for the solar minimum :
A ramp up in Solar Cycle 24 activity might not be expected though until the downtrend line in tilt angle from the peak in 2000 is broken , and that might be a year away .
Summary
Activity and timing of the current minimum , as well as the timing of the Solar Cycle 24 maximum in 2015 , is paralleling the start of the Maunder Minimum .
There is no data to date which diverges from the pattern of the start of the Maunder Minimum .

The Federal Government has acknowledged some overseas students will be angry as it revamps Australia 's skilled migration rules .
Immigration Minister Chris Evans is immediately scrapping the list of jobs used to pick migrants , replacing it with one more focused on highly - skilled work , meaning some overseas students will lose the chance to apply for permanent residency .
If the job they are studying for is not on the new list , foreign students will not be able to apply for a permanent residency visa unless an employer will sponsor them .
Senator Evans says in recognition of the problems the changes could cause for colleges and existing overseas students , he is temporarily allowing them to spend 18 months in Australia after graduation to work and seek sponsorship from employers .
He has also announced that around 20,000 people who applied for skilled migrant visas before September 2007 will have their applications cancelled and their fees refunded .
Senator Evans says the current list of jobs is distorting the economy .
" We had tens of thousands of students studying cookery and accounting and hairdressing because that was on the list and that got them through to permanent residency , " he said .
" We 've found that a lot of highly - skilled people with higher education degrees or a lot of overseas experience are n't passing the points test where people with a lower - level qualification and some education in Australia were .
" So we want to make sure we 're getting the high - end applicants . "
Senator Evans says the Government will announce the size of the migration intake for the year in the May budget , but Opposition Immigration spokesman Scott Morrison says the Government should not cut the proportion of skilled migrants .
" What I would n't want to see is a retreating on skilled migration - a lowering in the number of people proportionally that are coming under the skills program versus the family program , " he said .
" Because the greater percentage come on the family program - that 's higher levels of benefits that have to be paid out , higher levels of strain on the health system , higher levels of strain on other forms of assistance that is provided . "
Mr Morrison says he will be watching how the Government handles the backlash from colleges and students .
" It 's quite clear that there will be many colleges I suspect that will go out of business , " he said .
" There 'll be people who are currently studying courses who'll find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place , and we 'll find out just how well the Government 's thought through these changes when they impact on the ground and we see the details of them . "
The changes have angered the education industry .
Colleges offering courses for overseas students say they are already doing it tough because of the controversy over violence directed towards Indians .
The chief executive officer of the Australian Council for Private Education and Training , Andrew Smith , says the viability of some institutions may be threatened .
" Our members deliver courses across a whole range of areas ... but we 've seen significant drop off in demand for Australian education from overseas over recent months , for a range of reasons , and we expect that this will further dampen that demand and there may well be job losses , " he said .
" We 've had a global financial crisis .
We have had serious reputational damage done to Australia 's image overseas .
" So people in the industry will now be very grateful that current students are able to have their arrangements continue , but they will also be very worried about the lack of information about what will happen beyond the release of the skilled occupation list . "
Democratic Sen . Ben Nelson held up introducing his amendment to tighten restrictions on federal funding for abortion to give Republican Sen.
Orrin Hatch and the Catholic bishops more time to review it , reports CQ's Alex Wayne .
Wayne reports ( subscription required ) :
But Nelson decided later Thursday to hold off after Orrin G. Hatch , R - Utah , said he thought that the measure was being rushed to the floor .
Hatch had expected to be the lead sponsor of the amendment , and he said he thought it was “ discourteous ” that Nelson was preparing — apparently at the behest of his leadership — to call up the amendment without Hatch ’s consent .
Nelson said that the amendment ’s language was not finished , and that groups opposed to abortion — notably the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops — needed more time to review it .
Additional time , he added , might lead to greater bipartisan support .
Unless Nelson and Hatch depart significantly from Stupak ’s language , their amendment has little chance of adoption .
The Stupak language would prohibit the public option from covering most abortions and would forbid private insurers to offer plans covering elective abortion to people who buy them using federal subsidies .

It 's hard to tell what , exactly , is going on in director Jack Kubizne 's video for Animal Collective 's " Brother Sport " , our # 23 track of 2009 .
At certain points , the hallucinatory clip is the story of two modern - primitive kids and a dog , who tear around a trailer park and stage a fingerpainting rave in a backwoods hut .
At other points , it 's a particularly acid-fried take on vintage 1970s Saturday morning cartoons .
And for one particularly queasy stretch , it 's a montage of multicolored black - lit eggs falling from the sky .
In other words , it 's an Animal Collective video , and you 're going to stop whatever you 're doing and watch it right now .

Blockbuster movie Avatar has added to its impressive list of accomplishments - which to date include inducing suicidal despair , attracting Golden Globes , provoking civil unrest and creating a plethora of Pandoras - by killing a Taiwanese man overcome by the 3D experience .
According to AFP , the 42 - year - old cinemagoer , surnamed Kuo , had a history of high blood pressure and suffered a stroke while watching the film in in the northern city of Hsinchu .
He was taken to hospital unconscious , where a scan revealed " his brain was haemorrhaging " .
He died 11 days later .
Emergency room doctor Peng Chin-chih told AFP : " It 's likely that the over - excitement from watching the movie triggered his symptoms . "
The China Times reported that the incident represented " the first death linked to watching James Cameron 's science - fiction epic " . ®
Manouchehr Mottaki said " conducive ground " had been reached in talks Western powers have responded with scepticism to a claim by Iran that a deal to swap enriched uranium for nuclear fuel could now be close .
Iran 's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told a security conference in Germany that an agreement could be reached in a " not too distant future " .
But the US and European Union said they were unconvinced and Iran must make a meaningful offer or face new sanctions .
The head of the UN nuclear watchdog said dialogue should be accelerated .
China , which opposes further sanctions , said talks were at a " crucial stage " .
The US and its allies fear Iran is attempting to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful in purpose .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates , in Ankara , cast doubt on Iran 's talk of an imminent deal , telling reporters : " I do n't have the sense that we 're close to an agreement . "
Our hand is still reaching out towards them [ Iran ] .
But so far it 's reaching out into nothingness
Guido Westerwelle
German foreign minister
If Iran was prepared to take up the proposal put forward by the so - called P5+1 - the US , Russia , China , UK and France plus Germany - on handing over its low - enriched uranium then it should take that message to the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the IAEA , he said .
He suggested that Western powers needed to think about whether it was now time to take a " different tack " on Iran .
Meanwhile , German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told the annual Munich security conference : " Our hand is still reaching out towards them [ Iran ] .
But so far it 's reaching out into nothingness .
" And I 've seen nothing since yesterday [ Friday ] that makes me want to change that view . "
The US National Security Adviser , General James Jones , warned of tighter sanctions and deeper international isolation for Iran .
And EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton told the conference that Iran must respond to the head of the IAEA over its nuclear programme .
NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE
Mined uranium ore is purified and reconstituted into solid form known as yellowcake Yellowcake is chemically processed and converted into Uranium Hexafluoride gas Gas is fed through centrifuges , where its isotopes separate and process is repeated until uranium is enriched Low - level enriched uranium is used for nuclear fuel Highly enriched uranium can be used in nuclear weapons
In depth : Nuclear fuel cycle Q&A : Iran and the nuclear issue " There is a need to restore confidence in the peaceful nature of Iran 's programme , " she said , according to Reuters .
" This must be done by dialogue .
But dialogue takes two , and I 'm ready to engage in meaningful and productive talks that deal directly with the issues that trouble us . "
The BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne , reporting from London , says the strong suspicion is that the Iranian remarks are just another attempt to fend off new sanctions being proposed by the United States .
On Saturday , Mr Mottaki said he had had " a very good meeting " with IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano .
" We discussed and exchanged views on a wide range of issues - views about the proposal that is on the table , " he said .
For his part , Mr Amano told reporters that Iran 's foreign minister had made no new proposals to him .
" We had a very interesting discussion , and on my part I can currently say that dialogue is continuing and should be accelerated , " he added .
Diplomatic manoeuvring
In January , diplomats said Iran had informed the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) that it did not accept the terms of the deal agreed in October by Iran , the IAEA and the P5+1 .
In response , the US , Britain and France have been pressing for more sanctions and earlier this week circulated a discussion paper on further possible measures against the country .
The move came despite recent comments by Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad indicating that the country would have " no problem " sending much of its low - enriched uranium abroad so it could be processed into fuel - an arrangement envisaged by the October agreement .
Western diplomats reacted warily to Mr Ahmedinejad 's comments .
But China 's Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told the Munich conference that the P5+1 should remain patient and keep pursuing a diplomatic solution to the issue .

The government 's sacked former chief drugs adviser Professor David Nutt has vowed to tell the " truth about drugs " as he launched a rival advisory group .
He claimed it would " take over " the role of scientific advisers from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) , which could no longer function .
The Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs ( ISCD ) included " powerful " former members of the ACMD , he said .
The government said scientific advice would remain a key ACMD component .
' We are future ' Prof Nutt told the BBC : " This new committee we have set up is a very , very strong scientific pedigree , already we have over a dozen members of the top scientific pedigree .
What this committee will do is provide to you the truth about drugs , unfettered by any political influence
Prof David Nutt
" So it is difficult for the government to set up a comparable group because many of the key scientists are with us , but more than that , because we are independent ... the government 's own committee is not able to function . "
Launching the ISCD , Prof Nutt claimed : " We are the future of scientific advisory committees to government . "
He earlier told reporters : " What this committee will do is provide to you the truth about drugs , unfettered by any political influence . "
He said the ACMD was no longer a scientific body , but made up of drug treatment people , police and magistrates who would focus on policy .
ANALYSIS Danny Shaw , BBC home affairs correspondent
At the ACMD , said David Nutt , there was always " pressure " from his political masters .
Now , in his new group , he has the freedom to spell out the scientific evidence behind drugs without worrying what politicians think .
As if to illustrate his sense of " liberation " , he has already ditched the panel 's working title , the Independent Council on Drug Harms , to the more stately Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs .
The committee aims to be Britain 's leading authority on the health risks of drug - taking .
If it achieves that ambition , the ACMD 's role in this regard would then be superfluous .
The fact that four former and five current ACMD members have signed up to or shown an interest in joining simply adds to doubts over the ACMD 's future .
He also said he had received a " very supportive e- mail " from pharmacology specialist Professor Les Iversen , who was named on Wednesday by the Home Office as the new ACMD chairman .
" We will do the science and I guess they will do what they can do , which I suppose will be policy , " he said .
When he announced his plans for the group , Prof Nutt said it would take over the science role of the ACMD .
But a government spokesman said : " The ACMD will continue to offer recommendations to government on the control of harmful drugs .
Scientific advice has always been a key component of its recommendations , and will continue to be so .
" However , the ACMD also provides advice on issues such as scheduling ( under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations ) for legitimate use of substances ; a non-statutory body would not necessarily look to provide this advice . "
The government also said the ACMD routinely considers evidence from a wide range of sources , including external experts and would continue to do so .
BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said he understood the new organisation of around 20 specialists had secured funding from a benefactor for three years .
ACMD chairman Prof Les Iversen once backed the legalisation of cannabis
It is also being supported by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies think tank .
Prof Nutt was sacked by Home Secretary Alan Johnson last October after publicly disagreeing with the government 's decision to re-classify cannabis as a Class B drug and not to downgrade ecstasy .
Five ACMD members then resigned in the row that followed Prof Nutt 's departure .
It later emerged that two other ACMD members had also stepped down , though the Home Office said their departures were unrelated to the Nutt affair .
Prof Iversen 's appointment as the new ACMD chairman was overshadowed by the revelation he had once backed the legalisation of cannabis .
In an article in 2003 , he wrote that cannabis had been " incorrectly " classified as a dangerous drug for almost 50 years and said it was one of the " safer " recreational drugs .
But he told BBC Radio 5 live he had since changed his mind because of new evidence about the dangers of cannabis .
It was the home secretary 's prerogative to make decisions about drug classification and accept or reject scientific advice , Prof Iverson added .

The sale of a Montblanc pen to mark Gandhi 's birth has angered many German pen maker Montblanc has apologised unconditionally to a court in southern India for a luxury pen containing images of Mahatma Gandhi .
The firm told the court in Kerala state it would suspend sales of the $ 24,000 ( £ 16,000 ) pen until a ruling on whether it could continue to sell it in India .
Opponents of the pricey pen argue that it is an inappropriate way of honouring a man who was known for his austerity .
The gold and silver limited edition pen includes an engraving of Gandhi .
Mahatma Gandhi is seen as the father of Indian independence and revered as a global spiritual leader .
Golden thread The Centre for Consumer Education in Kerala filed a lawsuit last autumn to try to stop the Montblanc pen being distributed .
It argues that the pen is in breach of a 1950 Indian law prohibiting the improper use of emblems and names .
While the court deliberates , the company has promised to put sales on hold .
" We have agreed to stop selling the pen until the court decides on the matter , " Pankaj Shah , director of International Trading Private Limited , which distributes Montblanc pens in India , told the BBC .
Just 241 of the handmade pens will be sold , reflecting the number of miles Gandhi walked in his famous march against salt taxes in 1930 .
Each pen comes with an eight - metre golden thread that can be wound around the pen , representing the spindle and cotton Gandhi used to weave simple cloth .
Mr Shah said 42 of the 70 pens " allotted " for India had already been sold since they were launched in early October .
Gandhi's great - grandson Tushar Gandhi has endorsed the idea .
His charitable foundation has already received a donation of $ 145,000 from Montblanc and will receive between $ 200 and $ 1,000 for each pen sold .
For those who find the pen a little out of their price range , there is a more affordable version - there are 3,000 roller ball and fountain pens on sale for about $ 3,000 each .

Advertisement Mountain rescue teams say two pairs of walkers are lucky to be alive , after trying to climb Snowdon in treacherous weather in tracksuits and trainers .
Two men from Warrington , Cheshire slipped 200 ft ( 61 m ) down a snow face before being located by an RAF crew .
Rescuers had been involved in reaching two students from London who became tired on the mountain on Tuesday .
Rescue teams said it was " utterly unnecessary " and they were horrified both pairs were so badly - equipped .
The latest incident happened on Wednesday morning after two men slipped around 200 ft ( 61 m ) down a snow face .
The incidents came within hours of a campaign launched to improve safety .
Elfyn Jones from Llanberis mountain rescue team said both rescue incidents were " completely and utterly unnecessary " .
Temperatures on the highest peak in England and Wales have been sub - zero for the whole week , with heavy snowfalls making conditions underfoot treacherous .
Tuesday 's rescue saw two students , in their 20s and from the London area , overcome by exertion as they attempted to reach the summit of Snowdon via the ranger path .
Both pairs of walkers were rescued by RAF Valley crews Wearing just trainers and tracksuits , they spent around an hour - and - half sitting in deep snow waiting for rescuers to reach them in the dark .
After being reached by the Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team , they were airlifted off the mountain and treated for hypothermia in hospital .
Mr Jones said the man had no protective clothing , ice axes , crampons or torches .
" The only thing they had was a mobile phone which they used to call the ambulance service , " said Mr Jones .
' Poorly equipped '
On Wednesday morning , the emergency services were called out at 10.30 GMT after two men in their 20s slipped on snow below Clogwyn Station .
Crews from RAF
Valley said the pair were difficult to find because they were poorly equipped , with no maps or lights .
Again , the pair were dressed in just tracksuits and trainers , despite Arctic conditions on the mountain .
Mr Jones said the pair were lucky to be alive , but they had been found relatively quickly using a thermal image camera .
The Llanberis team had followed the men's tracks through the snow to find them very cold and shocked .
We want people to enjoy the mountains , but incidents like these two give everyone else a bad name
Elfyn Jones
The men , from Warrington , had been on the mountain since early on Wednesday morning .
They and the pair from Tuesday had all been given " sound advice " about their failure to have proper clothing and equipment .
" I do n't think we 'll be seeing them in Snowdonia again soon , " he added .
" The mountains are a great place to be if people go properly equipped and prepared and take heed of the the conditions and the weather forecasts .
" We want people to enjoy the mountains , but incidents like these two give everyone else a bad name . "
The latest rescues came within hours of the launch of the MountainSafe initiative on Tuesday .
Bringing together North Wales Police , the North Wales Mountain Rescue Association and the Snowdonia National Park Authority , it aims to highlight the dangers present in the area , and spell out the need to be properly prepared and equipped .
This year has seen an unprecedented increase in rescue call outs , more than 300 for the Llanberis , Ogwen Valley and Aberglaslyn teams .
Launching the scheme , Tim Bird , of North Wales Police , who is also a member of the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team said : " We want people to continue to come and enjoy the beautiful mountains of north Wales .
" But before they set out they need to ask themselves are they properly clothed and equipped ; do they know the weather forecast ; have they got the mountain skills needed for the terrain they 're about to tackle ? "

CINCINNATI -- Chad Ochocinco hopes to show a Pro Bowl audience that he can kick it as well as catch it .
The Bengals receiver made some kickoffs Thursday during practice for the Pro Bowl in Miami , hoping to convince the coaches that he 's capable of going toe - to - toe .
He showed off his punting skills during warmups a day earlier .
Ochocinco told The Associated Press in a phone interview after practice that he's also planning to kick field goals during practice this week .
He wants to persuade AFC coaches that he could be more than a just receiver during the game on Sunday .
" Yesterday was punting , today was kickoffs , tomorrow will be field goals , " Ochocinco said of his lobbying effort .
" I do n't know .
We 'll see what happens . "
If the coaches want more proof , he 's got the tape .
The six - time Pro Bowl receiver is an international soccer fan and practices kicking .
He had never done it during a game until last August , when Bengals kicker Shayne Graham was bothered by a sore groin in practice before a preseason game against the New England Patriots in Foxborough .
Ochocinco kicked an extra point and had a deep kickoff as Graham 's replacement , providing the winning point in Cincinnati's 7 - 6 victory .
Afterward , he referred to himself as " Esteban Ochocinco , the most interesting footballer in the world . "
He 'd like to do it again on the all - star stage .
" It should n't be a problem , " he said .
" If they 're going to let me do it , I 'm going to do it early in the game before they get serious and they start to play for real . "
SAN FRANCISCO — The " Llano " processor that AMD described today in an ISSCC session is not a CPU , and it 's not a GPU — instead , it 's a hybrid design that the chipmaker is calling an " accelerated processor unit , " or APU .
Whatever you call it , it could well give
Intel a run for its money in the laptop market , by combining a full DX11 - compatible GPU with four out - of - order CPU cores on a single , 32nm processor die .
Details on the highly parallel vector hardware — the " GPU " part of the device — have yet to be disclosed , but AMD is focusing today 's revelations on the CPU part of the design .
In a nutshell , AMD has taken the " STARS " core that 's used in their current 45nm offerings , shrunk it to a new 32nm SOI high -K process , and added new power gating and dynamic power optimization capabilities to it .
Each out - of - order core has a bit under 35 million transistors , and a 1MB L2 cache that 's not included in that number .
AMD is targeting sub - 3GHz operation , and a power consumption range of 2.5 to 25 watts .
The chipmaker will put down four such cores , shown in the micrograph below , along with enough vector hardware to power a DX11 GPU .
Overall , most of the work on the x86 side of Llano was done on dynamic power optimization and on fitting the design to the 32nm process .
In this respect , Llano differs from the upcoming " Bobcat " mobile part in that the latter is more portable across a range of processes and configurations , and features less custom work .
A die shot of Llano from an AMD slide .
AMD has announced that Llano will be sampling in the second half of this year , and will be available from OEMs sometime in 2011 .
Power optimization goes digital
It 's not often that I say this , but perhaps the most interesting and novel part of the Llano core is its unique approach to dynamic power optimization .
AMD fellow Sam Naffziger walked me through the approach in a briefing this morning , and it departs from traditional power management approaches in that it relies on digital , not analog , data .
A normal processor power module takes analog input from a set of diodes placed throughout the die , and these diodes act as thermal sensors , informing the module when the die heats up in an area due to increased compute activity .
In this model , then , die temperature is monitored as a proxy for power consumption , and the power module uses this temperature / power data to make on - the - fly adjustments to parameters like clockspeed .
The blessing and curse of this method is that these analog sensors respond to every change in thermals , whether it 's driven by an actual , compute - related boost in power consumption or by external , environmental factors , like a sudden rise in ambient temperature .
Llano 's approach , in contrast , uses a set of 95 digital signals from different parts of the chip that AMD has empirically identified as having a strong correlation to power consumption .
So signals like integer traffic , cache misses , or branch mispredicts are monitored via low - frequency sampling , and these signals give the power module a picture of the chip 's power consumption that AMD claims " is accurate to within 2 percent across a broad range of application types . "
High hopes for first genuine " Fusion " offspring of AMD + ATI
I personally have relatively high hopes for Llano as notebook part that could well out - do whatever Intel has in 2011 .
Intel is infamous for the poor quality of its integrated graphics processors ( IGPs ) , and , while the most recent Intel IGPs are much less embarrassing than their predecessors , it 's not clear that the company has the ability or the will to compete with NVIDIA and AMD / ATI in this area .
So when it comes to raw performance as a CPU and GPU , I expect Llano to do quite well .
But for commercial success as a mobile part , the big question concerns Llano 's platform - level power draw , and that will depend on real - world success of the power management innovations that AMD has introduced today .
It 's possible that , for gaming on - the - go , Llano 's biggest competitor will be NVIDIA 's upcoming x86 CPU + GPU combination .
But right now , that device is still just a secret skunkworks project about which almost nothing is known .
Still , if it 's not public by 2011 , I 'm not sure what NVIDIA 's mobile strategy will look like .
With CPU / GPU fusion products like Llano and the DMI licensing dispute combining to kill NVIDIA 's IGP business , the company needs new mobile ideas in a big way .

Sen .
Al Franken wants to make sure other people besides Comcast cable subscribers will be able to watch 30 Rock and The Office online .
According to his written questions to Comcast and NBC Universal 's executives about their proposed $ 30 - billion merge , Franken requested that they promise to put all their television shows online .
He also wants to make sure that the company will let other online users , besides Comcast cable providers , according to the LA Times .
If the Department of Justice and the FCC approve the deal , Franken wants a guarantee that they wo n't remove any shows are already online .
Both executives said during the first round of hearings on Feb.
4 that they have no plans to change their current online content .
But merging the company could block out their competition , as critics have noted .
Although neither executive gave direct answers on what kind of exclusive content partnership deals they might make , both Comcast and NBCU said they would follow the FCC 's rules .
Both NBC Universal 's Jeff Zucker and Comcast CEO Brian Roberts will continue their dance on Capitol Hill on Feb. 25 to sway lawmakers on to their side of the merger debate .
I was shocked to see out of all the streets in my town , there is a row of camera 's through my town all the way to my front door ... wild huh ~ !
It wouldnt bother me so much but it appears I 'm special .... only a few roads got as much attention as mine did ... so , whats special about me ...?
I 'm fed up with BS and I make it known .
I also know how they did it ...
every few months they send out Change Orders to the Law Books , Code Books what ever ... its like a SOP ( Standard Operating Proceedures ) .
now , when they passed the law it complied with the Constitution and all agreed its a fine law .
over time they make word changes to change the law to something no one would agree with , but then again its already law and they hide the truth of the law using codes to refer to already approved codes laws etc ... a word is a powerful thing ... after readying a few of these change orders instead of just making the change ...
I saw how they are changing capitalism to communism ... its very sudle and once its law it doesnt take much to change it , but it takes a war to remove the corrupted law or code .

One of New York 's hottest startups , Foursquare , is under heavy fire from more established Silicon Valley players .
A source briefed on the matter tells us Facebook is working on a feature that will allow users who access the network from mobile devices to " check - in " and broadcast their current location to all their friends .
Huge local business reviews site Yelp rolled out a similar " check - in " feature earlier this month .
Allowing users to " check - in " is Foursquare 's primary function .
Facebook , with its huge scale and wealth of engineering talent , could squash Foursquare .
Mainly , that 's because like with Foursquare -- and unlike with Yelp or Twitter -- Facebook friends are your real friends .
They are the kind of people you want to see that you 've checked - in at a bar , and then meet you there .
We 'd caution that this is a single source and that plans can always change .
At a place like Facebook , lots of things are always being hacked together , but no one is ever quite sure what will make it as a full release product .
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- a Bill Gates acolyte -- has shown plenty of willingness to use great ideas first conceived of elsewhere .
Just ask Twitter .
Reached , a Facebook spokesperson refused to comment .
For his part , Foursquare cofounder Dennis Crowley told us he fully expects Facebook and others to launch " check - in " functionality , making it " commodity by the end of the year . "
Dennis says Foursquare 's survival depends on providing " the most incentive for a user to check - in . "
Right now , Foursquare awards frequent users badges and calls the users who check - in at certain venues the most " mayor . "
" I think we 're doing this better than anyone else and I think we 'll continue to do so .
We have so much stuff on the whiteboard that we have n't even touched yet ... we 're really just getting started . "
Here 's who Dennis and company are going against :
Yelp
Advantages : Scale , brand , ardent community , large app install base .
More money from investors like Elevation Partners .
Disadvantages :
Not your real friends .
It 's a site for writers .
No Foursquare - like gaming element .
Gowalla
Advantages : Closer to mainstream than Foursquare .
Has more money than Foursquare , from sexy investors like Greylock .
Not based in New York so it 's closer to " real " America .
Disadvantages :
Not based in New York , which is the perfect city for this kind of software .
Facebook
Advantages : Huge scale .
Has tons of engineering talent .
Like with Foursquare , Facebook friends are your real friends -- the kind of people you want to join you when you go out .
Disadvantages : Unlike Foursquare , Facebook can afford to fail .
Potential rivals also include Twitter and CitySearch .
Have no idea what Foursquare is or how it works ?

Hackers tampered with a picture of Health Sec. Francisco Duque III ( left ) .
The original picture ( right ) shows him blowing on a horn .
MANILA , Philippines - Hackers vandalized several official government websites prior to the holidays , prompting internet security experts to question the government 's ability to protect sensitive information .
On December 17 , users visiting the Department of Health ( DOH ) website found a picture of Health Sec. Francisco Duque III apparently holding genitals towards his mouth .
On the upper left corner of the picture , which accompanied a press release about the DOH 's firecracker ban campaign , was a drawing of a penis with the words " Use Penis " next to it .
The original picture showed Duque blowing on a " torotot " or horn .
The DOH had encouraged the public to make noise with horns or pans instead of using firecrackers during the holidays in order to minimize firecracker - related injuries .
Before the DOH website could be fixed , the tampered picture was quickly spread in social networking sites .
The next day , alleged Indonesian hackers broke into the official website of the Department of Social Welfare and Development ( DSWD ) .
The DSWD home page displayed a large picture of a green and glowing Grim Reaper bearing the words " Hacker - newbie.org " , a Bahasa forum reportedly for hacker communities .
More recently , the National Disaster Coordinating Council 's official website was also hacked by " Heart Hacker . "
Viewers visiting the agency 's home page instead saw a black - and - gray message box proclaiming that the site had been hacked .
Can elections be ' hacked ' ?
Information Technology ( IT ) expert Jerry Lao said hackers can break into web servers , the " space " where websites are housed or located , by breaking a password or entering through the " back door . "
" Once you get in , you can practically do anything with the site , " he said .
Lao said the series of hacking incidents on Philippine government websites serves as a " wake - up " call for authorities , especially military agencies like the NDCC , to heighten their website security .
" Huwag sila basta basta mag - host lang na hindi nila man lang tinitignan kung ano ang mga security features ng web company .
( They should n't just host on a server without looking at the web company 's security features ) , " he told ABS - CBN News in an interview .
Experts like Lao broached the possibility of hackers breaking into government websites and tampering with vitally important data , such as those of the Commission on Elections , which is overseeing poll automation in 2010 .
" The security features of the Comelec , I 'm pretty sure , are stringent and it 's harder to get in .
But hackers can still try to get in .
The question is , can the Comelec handle it ? "
Lao said .
Comelec spokersperson James Jimenez , however , said he is confident that the Comelec 's software and database for the automated elections cannot easily be compromised .
He said the poll body had meticulously studied the database 's security features and protocol .
" The protocol for protecting the website , it 's something that we 've had experience with .
And we are confident that we can do that for the 2010 elections , " he said .

The human brain works at a far higher level of complexity than previously thought .
What has been given little attention up to now in the information processing of neuronal circuits has been the time factor .
" Liquid computing " -- a new theory about how these complex networks of nerve cells actually work from computer scientists at Graz University of Technology -- has just passed its first test .
An interdisciplinary co-operation with neuroscientists from the Max - Planck Institute ( MPI ) for Brain Research in Frankfurt managed to show that early processing stages in the brain pool information over a longer period .
For the evaluation of the experiments , the researchers also had to crack the neuronal code .
The scientists published the new findings of their research work , which is funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF in Austria , in the current edition of PLoS Biology .
The idea that the brain processes information step by step appears out of date .
" The human brain does not work on the principle of the assembly line .
In processing information , it is possible that time is treated much more flexibly than previously thought , " explained Wolfgang Maass , head of the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science at Graz University of Technology .
Like waves on a pool
His Graz colleague , Stefan Häusler , compares the basic principle with a surface of water .
" The brain works like a pond in which stones are thrown .
The waves caused by this do n't disappear immediately , but rather overlap with each other and collect information about how many stones were thrown in and how big they were .
The main difference is just that the waves in the brain spread in a network of neurons and at very high speed , " explained Stefan Häusler .
The theory of " liquid computing " was then experimentally investigated for the first time in co-operation with Frankfurt brain researchers Danko Nikolić and Wolf Singer .
However , the evaluation of the experiments proved a challenge for the computer scientists .
They had to crack the coding scheme by which large numbers of neurons encode information in a distributed manner .
They were able achieve this with the help of new methods from automated pattern recognition .
Simulating the human brain as vision
The underlying theory of liquid computing was developed by Swiss neuroscientist Henry Markram together with Graz University of Technology computer scientist Maass who has only this year published his new model for the calculations in the human brain in the journal Nature Reviews in Neuroscience .
This theory of information processing in neuronal circuits in the brain was experimentally investigated .
" The results from the collaboration with the MPI , led by well - known brain researcher Wolf Singer , is one of those rare cases where a hypothesis on the organization of computations in the brain that emerged from computer science theory was tested through neurobiological experiments , and has been confirmed , " added Wolfgang Maass .
The vision of the researchers is to develop new perspectives to better understand the interaction of the cells in the brain , ultimately ranging to comprehensively simulating parts of the brain .

A simple planetoid can be constructed from a landscape photograph , transformed with some fairly simple steps in Photoshop , adjusting image dimensions and using the Polar Coordinates filter .
The planetoids in this post take the process much further .
Generally , a 360 - degree panoramic image is created from a number of photos stitched and blended together , resulting in an image that presents everything visible from a single viewpoint in space .
Panoramic stitching software such as PTGui may be used for this process .
The image is then stereographically projected into a spherical form .
This process produces the awesome artworks listed below , astonishing images made from everyday scenes .
There are many tutorials available on the Internet explaining how you can begin building your own universe of planetoid photographs .

En el drama humanitario en el que se ha convertido Haití , a una semana del terremoto , no se sabe a ciencia cierta cuántos mexicanos murieron en el país caribeño .
Las cifras no han podido establecerse con claridad y precisión por la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores .
Por momentos la dependencia parece no querer aceptar lo inevitable , y en sus últimos censos habla sólo de una mexicana muerta , Karen Valero ; mientras que las cifras de mexicanos “ aún no ubicados ” , o en el mejor de los casos “ desaparecidos ” , van de 66 a 27 .
La esperanza de encontrar con vida a más mexicanos entre los escombros , o de ubicarlos vivos en territorio haitiano , creció ayer con el rescate sorpresivo del profesor Carlos Peralta , que sobrevivió atrapado entre las ruinas de lo que fue una universidad .
Era maestro de español y fue rescatado por haitianos que lo encontraron y sacaron de los cascajos .
Será difícil saber pronto cuántos mexicanos más murieron o cuántos están aún vivos .
Aunque pareciera que la Cancillería intentara minimizar u ocultar una cifra de compatriotas muertos , la realidad es que la diplomacia mexicana se ha topado con el mismo caos y desorden que priva en Haití , y que ha dificultado saber con exactitud y certeza cuántos nacionales había allá al momento del terremoto .
En las casas de los mexicanos que entraron a Haití hasta el 12 de enero , la Cancillería ha dejado recados diciendo que aún están en la búsqueda , que se hacen todos los esfuerzos del Gobierno mexicano y que oficialmente aún no se les puede considerar muertos .
Son más de 66 familias en nuestro país que en este momento están en la incertidumbre que conservan algunas la esperanza y otras que ya esperan lo peor .
Otros 65 mexicanos ya fueron ubicados e identificados , dice la Cancillería , y de esos 30 ya salieron de Haití , 14 de ellos regresaron a México y otros fueron a otros países , mientras que 30 permanecen en territorio haitiano .
Las razones por las que estos mexicanos fueron a vivir a un país con tantos problemas económicos y sociales , son diversas ; algunos se casaron con ciudadanos de Haití , otros iban por trabajo o negocios ; pero del total de connacionales , la mayor parte tenían un bajo nivel social en México .
Irse a vivir a Haití , en cualquier caso es una decisión de mucho valor .
Y no porque en México no haya varios de los problemas que tiene la nación caribeña : pobreza , desempleo , inseguridad , violencia ; pero con todo , aún con el caos que viven algunas zonas del país por el narcotráfico — Ciudad Juárez por ejemplo — entre vivir en México y en Haití aún hay claras diferencias .
Por ejemplo los dos mexicanos que llegaron ayer por la mañana a México , vivían allá en una montaña , afuera de Puerto Príncipe , y se fueron al cerro porque allá se sentían seguros .
Es como si en México hubieran vivido en una barranca de Álvaro Obregón o en Cuautepec El Alto , tal vez con las mismas carencias , sólo que en un país que no era el suyo .
Algunos de los sobrevivientes volverán a México , tal vez a una realidad no muy distinta a la que vivían en Haití ; otros decidirán permanecer allá porque ya tienen allá sus raíces .
Pero otros mexicanos , aún no se sabe cuántos , quedarán sepultados entre los escombros o en las fosas comunes ; así que por muchas razones , esta tragedia también es nuestra .

The father of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the 23 - year - old charged with attempting to bomb a US passenger plane en route to Detroit from Amsterdam , says he informed the US embassy in Nigeria as well as the Nigerian Intelligence Agency of his son's extremist views .
According to a cousin of Abdulmutallab , Abdulmutallab's father Umaru Mutallab offered approval for his son's desire to study Arabic in Yemen over the summer .
Prior to the trip , Abdulmutallab had a good reputation among relatives as " a very religious , polite and studious fellow . "
However , Mutallab and other members of the family became worried when Abdulmutallab said he was dropping his post - graduate program in business administration and was pursuing another course in Yemen which he did not disclose .
Mutallab finally decided to tell authorities about his son when Abdulmutallab sent a text message informing his family that he was severing all contact .
Upon hearing of his attempted attack , Abdulmutallab 's family said they were completely stunned .
" He was such a brilliant boy and nobody in the family had the slightest thought he could do something as insane as this , " one relative told AFP .
Reported links to al - Qaeda
As the case against Abdulmutallab builds , there was speculation that the 23 - year - old had ties to al - Qaeda in Yemen .
Abdulmutallab allegedly told investigators that he acquired his explosives , and instructions on how to use them , from the terrorist group 's operatives there .
However , US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano warned it would be " inappropriate " to speculate his links to al - Qaeda , since the investigation is ongoing .
A US official said Abdulmutallab was entered into an intelligence database of known and suspected terrorists last month , but added that there was not enough data on him at the time to put him on a " no - fly " list .
A " sophisticated " device
Families and friends faced an anxious wait
Abdulmutallab's suspected explosive device has been described as " fairly sophisticated " and included a powdered substance located in his underwear , as well as liquid contained in a syringe .
An initial FBI analysis revealed traces of one of the same substances used by the so - called " shoe bomber , " Richard Reid , in his failed attempt to blow up a US passenger jet days before Christmas in 2001 .
Referring to the latest incident , US Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement that had " this alleged plot to destroy an airplane been successful , scores of innocent people would have been killed or injured . "
Abdulmutallab was overpowered by other passengers after they heard a pop and saw flames as the plane made its approach to land .
Two passengers were injured and the suspect suffered serious burns .
Airline officials described the explosives as resembling firecrackers .
The fire was put out with blankets and fire extinguishers and the man was dragged to the front of the plane .
The Northwest Airlines flight , operated by Delta , made a safe landing and all 278 passengers were escorted to safety .
EU examines its end
Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport will need to review its security procedures
The US has called on airlines and airports worldwide to implement tighter security measures , including frisks for all passengers headed to the US , and extra checks for carry - on luggage .
Authorities in London have been searching buildings where Abdulmutallab was believed to have stayed while studying engineering there .
" We are in liaison with the US authorities and searches in London are being conducted as part of ongoing enquiries , " a police spokeswoman in the British capital said .
The European Commission said on Saturday that it was investigating whether proper security measures had been followed at Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport , where the Delta flight originated .
" I am horrified by the attempted terrorist attack , " Jacques Barrot , vice president of the Commission said in a statement .
" The European Commission is in contact with the relevant authorities to make sure that all rules and procedures were followed in Europe .
We are in touch with our Dutch and US counterparts . "
Dutch counter - terrorism authorities said Abdulmutallab transited at Schiphol after arriving on a KLM flight from Lagos , Nigeria .
Although he went through a security checkpoint at Schiphol , transit passengers generally face looser checks than other departure passengers .

WASHINGTON 
If negotiators reach an accord at the climate talks in Copenhagen it will entail profound shifts in energy production , dislocations in how and where people live , sweeping changes in agriculture and forestry and the creation of complex new markets in global warming pollution credits .
So what is all this going to cost ?
The short answer is trillions of dollars over the next few decades .
It is a significant sum but a relatively small fraction of the world ’s total economic output .
In energy infrastructure alone , the transformational ambitions that delegates to the United Nations climate change conference are expected to set in the coming days will cost more than $ 10 trillion in additional investment from 2010 to 2030 , according to a new estimate from the International Energy Agency .
As scary as that number sounds , the agency said that the costs would ramp up relatively slowly and be largely offset by economic benefits in new jobs , improved lives , more secure energy supplies and a reduced danger of climate catastrophe .
Most of the investment will come from private rather than public funds , the agency contends .
“ People often ask about the costs , ” said Kevin Parker , the global head of Deutsche Bank Asset Management , who tracks climate policy for the bank .
“ But the figures people tend to cite do n’t take into account conservation and efficiency measures that are easily available .
And they do n’t look at the cost of inaction , which is the extinction of the human race .
Period . ”
Britain 's largest overhead power line project has been approved despite fierce protests over the decision to erect towering pylons along 220 km of the Highland 's finest scenery .
The long - awaited go ahead for the power line , which will stretch from Beauly near Inverness to Denny near Falkirk on pylons up to 65 m high , is expected to kickstart a huge overhaul of the UK 's electricity network at a cost of up to £ 4.7bn .
The decision was applauded by the renewable energy industry and backed by many leading environment groups .
They said the new line , which will be upgraded from 132 kV to 400 kV , was essential for plans to ramp up the output from wind , wave and tidal power projects , often best located in remote parts of the UK , and deliver it to the cities where most people lived .
But its opponents were furious , and accused the Scottish government of sacrificing large areas of the Highlands , including treasured beauty spots in Perthshire such as Queen 's View on Loch Tummel , the Cairngorms national park and around Beauly near the Moray Firth .
Helen McDade , of the landscape conservation charity the John Muir Trust , one of the project 's fiercest critics , said it was a " black day " .
She added : " Marching a 220 km mega pylon line though some of our most world - renowned landscapes may be the most lucrative option for the energy industry but it is the wrong choice for Scotland . "
The Scottish energy minister , Jim Mather , said the Beauly to Denny line was crucial in his government 's efforts to generate up to 50 % of Scotland 's electricity from renewable sources and meet its promises to cut Scotland 's CO2 emissions by 42 % by 2020 .
But to placate critics , he imposed new conditions , requiring the power companies to remove or improve 86.5 k m of line at five places , and improve " visual mitigation " of the line at Crieff , Stirling and Plean .
Mather said he agreed with the energy industry that blocking the new line , a joint £ 400 m project between Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern , would have fatally undermined future green energy projects throughout the UK for the next decade .
Yet , in an argument set to rise further in intensity as the UK 's tough carbon targets loom , critics insist that new wave of power projects will scar the British landscape with bigger pylons , and make it far easier to build windfarms in unsuitable places .
The new line will replace an existing power line and actually use fewer pylons – 600 compared to the 800 currently in place .
Many of the new pylons will be more hidden and further from homes .
Opponents said the largest pylons , which at 65 m high will be 24 m higher than the tallest existing pylons , would be vast , and have a footprint and volume seven times larger .
Beauly , home to some of Scotland 's oldest forest and rarest wildlife , will have a much larger substation for the new line and be the focal point for five power lines converging from across northern Scotland .
John Mayhew , director of the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland , said it was " the most disappointing planning decision in Scotland for many years .
Scotland 's landscapes are not some endless resource which can be shaved away time and again – they are finite , they are much valued by local people and they are the main attraction to visitors . "
Alex Salmond 's nationalist government has championed green power in Scotland and while many environment groups such as WWF Scotland backed the scheme , it has been very nervous about the political backlash today 's decision will cause .
The line , which was opposed by all the local councils affected and the Cairngorms park authority , goes through the key rural constituencies of three SNP ministers and its critics believe the SNP will lose votes at the next general election .
But Mather said the new line was economically vital .
It will significantly increase the amount of electricity exported from northern Scotland , including massive windfarms planned for Shetland and Caithness , and wave and tidal plants planned off Orkney , by 6.4GW .
A large coal - fired station generate 1GW .
In turn , a network of existing power lines across Scotland and northern England will be upgraded and new undersea cables laid down the east and west coast , increasing the capacity of the grid in Scotland by 11.4GW .
A major report last year on the future of the grid by the Electricity Network Strategy Group said £ 4.7bn worth of grid upgrades across Wales , Humberside and East Anglia , and around London , hinged on today 's decision .
" It is vital for Scotland to upgrade its networks so that it can realise its energy potential and important if Britain is going to meet its climate change targets , " said Chris Lock , a spokesman for the energy regulator , Ofgem .
The British Wind Energy Association said the Beauly Denny line would immediately kick start 1.5GW of new renewables projects and encourage the construction of a further 1.5 GW of schemes .
" This is good news , " said Charles Anglin , a BWEA spokesman .
" It is a first step towards rebuilding a 21st - century grid infrastructure which can accommodate a new generation of decentralised green energy . "
Willie Roe , chair of Highlands and Islands Enterprise said : " It paves the way for the Highlands and Islands to capitalise on its place as the renewable energy engine room of Europe .
It offers some of Scotland 's most economically fragile areas the prospect of participating at the frontier of a globally important industry . "
Readers of Domestic Disturbances , the online column Ms. Warner wrote for The New York Times until December , will be familiar with what happened next .
She sallied forth to interview all the pushy parents , irresponsible doctors and overmedicated children she could find  and lo , she could barely find any .
After several years of dead ends , missed deadlines and worried soul - searching , she was forced to reconsider her premise and start all over again .
“ We ’ve Got Issues ” is the product of that unusual cycle .
Journalists who cobble together enough anecdotes to support a preset agenda are all too common , and presumably Ms. Warner could have managed to do just that .
Instead , she actually let her research guide her thoughts : it whirled her perspective a full 180 degrees and , as she would be the first to affirm , lifted the scales from her eyes .
“ A couple of simple truths have become clear , ” she writes with the passion of a new convert .
“ That the suffering of children with mental health issues ( and their parents ) is very real .
That almost no parent takes the issue of psychiatric diagnosis lightly or rushes to ‘ drug ’ his or her child ; and that responsible child psychiatrists do n’t , either .
And that many children ’s lives are essentially saved by medication , particularly when it ’s combined with evidence - based forms of therapy . ”
How could she have been so convinced otherwise ?
Half the book is rueful legwork devoted to answering that question .

Ms. Warner points out that she was hardly alone in her previous assumptions : it is accepted wisdom in some circles , including , oddly , liberal - left “ moms ” and right - wing radio audiences , that the milder variants of attention deficit disorder , bipolar disorder and autism are just different ways of saying “ normal , but not good enough . ”

The United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs met in Vienna last year to review the effectiveness of the last decade of international drug policy .
It was agreed unanimously that health should be the motivating factor behind global drug policies , as hardline approaches to tackling illegal narcotics had not only failed but had eroded basic human rights and triggered a spike in HIV / AIDS .
Cambodia never officially declared a " war on drugs " as Vietnam and Thailand did , but its harsh approach to drug users resembled the policies of its neighbours to the west and east .
When announcements were made that Cambodia was planning to rehabilitate its drug users instead of jailing them , health advocates praised the government for what looked like a progressive move .
However , while the drug- detention centres were initially viewed as a positive solution , Joe Amon , the Director of the Health and Human Rights Division at Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) says calls to assist drug users with forced rehabilitation rather than incarceration should be treated with extreme caution .
" In reality , these centres are very prison - like but with the additional problem that … people can be held there without any due process , " Amon told newmatilda.com .
" Detainees are n’t seeing a lawyer , there is no judicial authorisation for their detention , they ca n’t appeal against their detention . "
With the release of a damning report titled Skin On The Cable by HRW last week , the Royal Cambodian Government is now facing accusations that drug users forcibly detained in state - run centres are being tortured , with former detainees testifying they were whipped , beaten and chained outdoors for hours in attempts to " cure " them of their dependency .
The allegations again call the Government ’s policy of compulsory rehabilitation into question after it was revealed late last year that an untested herbal medication was being trialled on detainees in these centres without their consent .
The HRW report documents the horrific conditions inside these centres , and contains harrowing testimonies from dozens of former detainees about their treatment .
HRW has called upon Phnom Penh to permanently close the compulsory drug - treatment centres and implement community - based voluntary programs to assist those with drug problems .
" The report speaks for itself — these are the voices of Cambodians who have been abused , even tortured , in what are supposed to be treatment centres , " said Amon .
" People described being whipped with electrical cables , beaten , raped or shocked with tasers .
There ’s nothing therapeutic about these places . "
Kronhong , an 18 - year - old drug user , told HRW that military police tortured him for two hours while trying to extract a confession , eventually beating him unconscious with a rifle butt .
M’noh , a 16 - year - old detainee , claimed staff members whipped inmates so fiercely with a cable that their skin peeled off .
Minea , a woman in her mid-20s , claims she was robbed during her arrest and then raped by two police officers before being let off without charge .
Drug dependency in Cambodia is viewed as a " moral weakness " , explains Graham Shaw , a technical officer with the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) .
Despite WHO ’s description of dependency as a " chronic , relapsing brain disease , " detainees are often declared " cured " after a couple of months in these centres simply because the drugs are no longer present in the body .
Lobbying the Government to develop voluntary treatment facilities such as methadone clinics instead of harsh compulsory " rehabilitation " centres has been an uphill battle .
HRW argues there is no evidence that forcing drug users into these centres for military - style drills and hard labour has actually reduced the number of Cambodians consuming narcotics .
" ’ Treatment ’ requires locking people up , forcing them to sweat to remove drugs from their systems and beating them to strengthen their resolve to stay off drugs , " said Amon .
" They were forced to work and exercise to the point of collapse , even when they were sick and malnourished . "
Watchdogs allege that Cambodia ’s respect for human rights deteriorated significantly in 2009 , a major setback for the country as it continues its transition towards a more open and transparent democracy .
Along with the forced detention of more than 2000 drug users in state - run centres , areas of concern include refugee abuses , judicial corruption and the continuing decline of press freedom .
While the Government ’s National Authority for Combating Drugs ( NACD ) said that the planned expansion of compulsory detention centres would incorporate human rights principles , critics claim the facilities violate Cambodia ’s constitutional and international obligations .
Holly Bradford , from a Cambodian harm reduction program called Korsang , said that studies have repeatedly shown that forced detention is not only unlawful , it simply does not work .
" The main concern is that they are illegal .
People are forced to go there without due process .
If Cambodia had proper , ethical drug treatment , drug users would not need to be forced to go — they would be lining up at the door begging to get in , " Bradford said .
Under Cambodia ’s existing drugs law , there are a number of ways a drug user can be forced to attend treatment centres — regardless of whether they consent or not .
Critics of compulsory detention claim this law is too broad and open to abuse and does not protect human rights standards , nor does it consider whether rehabilitation is in the best interests of the patient .
" The focus is not on health but on detention , " Shaw said .
" It is becoming increasingly apparent that these centres may in fact be making the situation worse . "
With assistance from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) in Cambodia , the Government is currently finalising a new law on drug control .
In terms of the provisions on compulsory treatment , the amended law is virtually no different from the existing one .
Amon claims the UNODC ’s involvement in the new draft law " is a scandal " as it contains almost no protections against ongoing abuses and arbitrary detention and still makes detaining an individual far too easy .
" What [ the draft law ] does do , shockingly , is eliminate criminal liability for those that run these centres , ensuring that abuses can continue with impunity , " Amon said .
" UN agencies in Cambodia need to speak out more forcefully with the Government and say plainly that these centres are outside of Cambodian and international human rights law and that they need to be shut down .
( Representatives from the UNODC in Cambodia could not be reached for comment in time for publication . )
According to HRW , only around 1 or 2 per cent of those detained enter the centres voluntarily , with more than half admitted by their families .
Alarmingly , nearly one in four detainees is under 18 .
Recent investigations into the facilities also found that police were arbitrarily arresting and detaining other people deemed " undesirable " — such as street children , the mentally ill and gamblers .
In the lead up to major holidays or international events , the police conduct sweeps throughout major cities to round up such people .
The Deputy Governor of a district in Phnom Penh justified the action when he said in May 2009 , " we collected them in order to keep the city clean . "
The Cambodian Government , while calling last year ’s HRW reports insulting , has begun to acknowledge problems in the centres and the need to develop alternatives , even flagging the introduction of a pilot methadone program .
On 19 January 2010 , the Chairman of the NACD surprisingly announced before UN representatives that the Government planned to shut all but one of its drug rehabilitation centres by 2015 and replace them with community - based alternatives nationwide .
Calling the move " a most welcome step forward " , and claiming Cambodia could become " one of the leading examples " of voluntary treatment in the next few years , Graham Shaw says only time will tell whether this declaration will replace past promises to dramatically expand the program .
In June 2009 , Prime Minister Hun Sen called for greater financial contributions to develop drug centres further , and already a massive project is underway to build a large - scale detainment facility .
The question now being asked is whether the government will crack down on those responsible for past abuses inside the centres .
" The government might try to dismiss or minimise our findings , " Amon said , " but the facts remain and the Government should conduct its own investigation and hold those responsible for the abuses we documented accountable . "

Alright .
Which one of you ate the last hot pocket ?

If you did n't cry during ' Life is beautiful ' then we can't be friends .
Her Majesty 's Revenue & Customs publishes an interesting note on the Money Laundering Regulations .
This lists 26 " suspicious indications " which should attract attention to the possibility that a financial transaction might need investigating .
These range from " checking identity is proving difficult " or " reluctance to provide information requested " to " unnecessary routing of funds through third parties " and " transactions having no purpose " or " which seem to involve unnecessary complexity " .
Any such " suspicious indications " , we are told , should prompt the filling in of a " 101 form " to report dubious financial dealings to the authorities .
But a good many of them would seem to apply only too neatly to the veil of obscurity our Government draws over the astronomical sums it is paying out in support of its religious belief in " climate change " .
In 2007 , according to India 's National Crime Records Bureau , 32,318 people were murdered in India .
Another 3644 were victims of '' culpable homicide '' , roughly equating to manslaughter .
In a category of its own , 8093 brides or their relatives were killed in '' dowry deaths ' ' - murdered by greedy grooms and in - laws angry over the amount of dowry paid by the bride 's family .
And there were a further 27,401 attempted murders .
By contrast , in 2007 , the Australian Bureau of Statistics reports , 255 people were murdered in Australia .
Another 28 were victims of manslaughter , and 246 survived attempted murders .
No dowry deaths were recorded .
India , of course , is a very big country .
But the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that relative to population , its homicide rate is more than twice that of Australia .
It is a country in which violent crime is commonplace - so commonplace that every day more than 100 Indians are murdered by other Indians , yet their TV news channels treat this as humdrum unless it involves some celebrity or unusual features .
Yet when an Indian is murdered overseas , these news channels whip themselves and their viewers into a froth of indignation at the country concerned .
How can this happen ? , they thunder .
How can any civilised nation fail to protect its residents ?
What kind of racist country is this ?
Back in 2007 , Senator Bernie Sanders introduced Senate Bill S 2398 , the Stop Outsourcing Security Act .
It collected a single co-sponsor , Senator Hillary Clinton .
The crux of the bill :
The use of private security contractors for mission critical functions undermines the mission , jeopardizes the safety of American troops conducting military operations in Iraq and other combat zones , and should be phased out .
It went nowhere .
Back in the heat of the presidential campaign , in February 2008 , Senator Clinton said that :
" ... from this war 's very beginning , this administration has permitted thousands of heavily - armed military contractors to march through Iraq without any law or court to rein them in or hold them accountable .
These private security contractors have been reckless and have compromised out mission in Iraq .
The time to show these contractors the door is long past due . "
Indeed .
And Clinton 's voice was not the only one raised against the damage done by mercenaries .
A Congressional report found the same , and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had tough words as well .
One of the main catalysts for those tough words was the company that now calls itself Xe but is still known to everyone as Blackwater .
Although Blackwater 's contract for security work in Iraq was canceled after nearly five years of behavior that some might call scandalously reckless and I call bloodthirsty , the administration in which Clinton is now a key player has found itself unable to cut its ties to Blackwater .
At a hearing last month of the Commission on Wartime Contracting , it was learned , as Justin Elliott reported at TPMuckracker , that Blackwater pre-qualified as one of the five companies to train Afghan police .
It was learned too that Blackwater is the only company that handles security for State Department employees in Afghanistan .
And it obviously has a security contract with the CIA for front line work in Afghanistan .
The question is why .
Or , rather , what the hell ?
As if U.S. military interventions were n't problematic enough , these cowboys still operate as if they were in some third - tier action movie .
Not a low - budget one , however .
As if all the sanguinary scandals and investigations of the past were n't enough , all through December , the headlines fairly screamed " Blackwatergate . "
First came the news about Blackwater participating in CIA raids in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Then a more than mildly perturbed judge ruled that the five company employees who had killed 17 civilians in Iraq could n't be tried because federal prosecutors had botched what should have been an airtight case against them by violating their constitutional rights .
Then it was learned that two of the seven CIA operatives killed December 30 by a double - agent suicide bomber in Khost , Afghanistan , were Blackwater employees .
Then it turned out that a third Blackwater employee was injured in the Khost bombing .
Then two Blackwater employees were indicted for murdering two Afghans last May .
The news about the deaths at Khost sent Illinois Democrat Jan Schakowsky , chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations , over the edge .
She was launching an investigation she told Jeremy Scahill , a reporter at The Nation who has been following Blackwater since he began research for his outstanding 2008 book , Blackwater : The Rise of the World 's Most Powerful Mercenary Army .
Schakowsky said :
" The Intelligence Committees and the public were led to believe that the CIA was phasing out its contracts with Blackwater and now we find out that there is this ongoing presence .
...
Is the CIA once again deceiving us about the relationship with Blackwater ?
... " It 's just astonishing that given the track record of Blackwater , which is a repeat offender endangering our mission repeatedly , endangering the lives of our military and costing the lives of innocent civilians , that there would be any relationship , " Schakowsky said .
" That we would continue to contract with them or any of Blackwater 's subsidiaries is completely unacceptable . "
Today , on Democracy Now , Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzalez interviewed Scahill and Schakowsky .
You can watch it , read the transcript at the link , or read the excerpt below :
JEREMY SCAHILL : ... Let ’s remember here that this was the worst attack on a CIA base that we know about since the 1980s .
And here you have three Blackwater guys in the center of this blast at the time .
Now , we ’re not sure what the role was of the Blackwater guys there .
That ’s what Representative Schakowsky is investigating right now .
But let ’s say for a moment that they were doing security , because Blackwater has , since 2002 , had a contract with the CIA to do force protection in Afghanistan for the CIA .
They not only guard static outposts of the CIA , but when CIA operatives move around the country , Blackwater guys travel with them as their security .
So if they were doing the security there , and you have , on their watch , this incredibly devastating attack , not just against some random CIA outpost in the middle of Canada or something , but against the epicenter of the forward operating maneuvers that the intelligence community of the US is engaged in to hunt down Ayman al - Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden , because this asset made it onto that base , we understand , claiming that he had just met with Ayman al - Zawahiri .
So how is it that he walks in there with explosives ?
And then , I think that should be one of the things that ’s investigated as Congresswoman Schakowsky takes this on .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Well , Congresswoman Schakowsky , your concerns about this latest report and what you ’re hoping to look into ?
REP .
JAN SCHAKOWSKY : You know , regardless of what the role that the Blackwater operatives were playing in this incident , why is the CIA , why is any unit of the government , the State Department , the Department of Defense — why would anyone hire this company , which is a repeat offender , threatening the mission of the United States , threatening , endangering the lives of American , well , CIA and military , and then — and also known to threaten and kill innocent civilians ?
It is just amazing to me , astonishing to me , that we still find Blackwater anywhere in the employ of the United States government at any place around the world .
AMY GOODMAN : Now , during the primaries , Hillary Clinton supported a ban on Blackwater .
President Obama did n’t .
How does that relate to what you ’re introducing now , the legislation that you ’re introducing ?
REP .
JAN SCHAKOWSKY : Look , I ’m introducing legislation called Stop Outsourcing Our Security , and the idea of that is that when we have mission - sensitive activities , inherently governmental functions in battle zones around the world , that we should have only people that bear the stamp of the United States government .
And that means that that would include no private military contractors at all in those operations .
Now , look , when we have a situation where you can question whether or not these contractors can get away with murder — after all , this case against those shooters at Nisoor Square has been dismissed — hopefully that there will be another effort by the Justice Department to go after these people , because it was dismissed for prosecutorial misconduct , which is true .
I think there were many mistakes made .
But right now , these contractors are in a legal limbo .
And so , if these individuals can get away with murder , imagine — you do n’t have to imagine , you know what it does to our relations with the Iraqi government and with governments around the world .
And now you ’ve got a situation where Germany is asking , what were Blackwater people doing in Germany ?
Not just Blackwater .
Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill , chairperson of the Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight , pointed out in mid-December that from June 2009 to September 2009 , there was a 40 % increase in Defense Department contractors in Afghanistan .
In the same period , the number of armed private security contractors working for the Pentagon in Afghanistan doubled , to more than 10,000 .
I suspect that the Stop Outsourcing Our Security legislation has no more chance of passing in 2010 than it did in 2007 - 08 .
That 's not merely troubling , it 's infuriating .
Because whatever you think of U.S. policy in Afghanistan - and I think the White House is on the wrong track and we 'll all soon come to regret it - who can doubt that these private armies are a serious danger , and not just to U.S. " interests and image " abroad , but , quite possibly in the not - too - distant future , to citizens at home .
Limited edition of Oversteps , 22 .
March 2010
Surprise , surprise !
Autechre are about to release a new album called “ Oversteps ” on 22 .
March 2010 .
No sound - excepts yet , but if I would judge by the cover- artwork , this album could sound a little like the “ Tri Repetae “ .
And that would be great , because at the time of Tri Repetae Autechre really invented much interesting things in music .
The last three albums were much to , hmm , let ’s say “ academic ” .
Just wait and see if this two UK - guys once again re-invented music or not .
The Supreme Court stabbed Democracy last week .
I was there ; I saw it happen .
I brought our petition with me and presented it to the Court .
Now it 's time to act .
We have filed six bills to reverse this assault , the " Save Our Democracy " platform .
Sign this petition today , and show your support for saving our democracy .
Together , we will move these bills forward and prevent the sale of our government to the highest bidder .
Introduction
The release of embarrassingly candid emails from the Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) of the University of East Anglia has intensified , if not vindicated , suspicions that scientific misconduct has played a significant role in fueling alarmism over supposed catastrophic manmade global warming .
Just days after news broke about what has been dubbed " Climategate , " Penn State University ( PSU ) announced that it would investigate the conduct of Michael Mann , a professor in PSU 's Department of Meteorology and a prominent figure in the Climategate emails .
While PSU is to be commended for recognizing that Climategate is a serious matter and that an investigation into Michael Mann 's conduct is warranted , the investigation constitutes a conflict of interest for the university .
Mann 's climate work brings enough visibility , prestige , and revenue to PSU to legitimately call into question the university 's ability to do a thorough and unbiased investigation .
To avoid this glaring conflict of interest and ensure that the investigation of Mann is credible , the Pennsylvania General Assembly should commission an external and independent investigation into Mann 's potential scientific misconduct .
Forces of Fortune : The Rise of the Muslim Middle Class and What It Will Mean For Our World
by Vali Nasr
( Free Press , 2009 )
The New Silk Road : How a Rising Arab World is Turning Away from the West and Rediscovering China
by Ben Simpfendorfer
( Palgrave - Macmillan , 2009 )
We are well into the rise or return of Asia .
A multipolar world is practically upon us , one whose big players will not be , for the first time in centuries , exclusively or overwhelmingly white Europeans or their settler offspring .
But what if we counted the Muslim world as part of this convalescence , a dispersed population counting as many people as China or India , made unique by asserted religiosity , new economic success , and heightened political intelligence ?
Few bother to contemplate .
Many perceptions and studies of Islam are paralyzed by teleology .
Namely , that there ’s one direction to modernity , and it ’s Western .
The contemporary Muslim is often scrutinized with the same incredulity and dismay that arises when one ’s most socially unfortunate acquaintance crashes the party of the year uninvited : “ Oh , turbaned colleague , what are you doing here now ? ” Islam sits in Dipesh Chakrabarty ’s “ waiting room of history , ” for it is not only perceived as backwards , it is actually believed to be in our past — sharing the same planet as us , but not the same century .
And so , journalists , thinkers and politicians lift up every Muslim rock and peek behind every Islamic veil to find the Oriental Martin Luther , the one who will take Islam from yesterday and bring it acceptably into today .
This nicely and additionally explains the unthinking references in our popular media to terms like “ the international community ” — whereby a certain understanding of the West is rendered conclusive and global .
But history is not so determined .
What then would happen then if , while such commentators insist on the obligation of Islam ’s conformity to the Western way , altered global conditions drained the matter of its urgency ?
What if a convergence of new sources of investment , rising business classes and ever more sophisticated politicians neither needed nor wanted to go West ?
If a rising China displaced America , what happens to the typical narrative — never mind the vile discourse al Qaeda propagates ?
Our president , more perceptive in this department than previous occupants of the office , senses these trends .
Obama has recently encouraged the G8 to give way to the G20 , which involves for example two crucial Muslim powers , Turkey and Indonesia .
But does his administration see the fullest picture ?
For there are parts of the Muslim world that are inhospitable and unstable .
But there are also regions wealthy with resources , industry , and youth .
By geography alone , the Muslim world could determine much of the coming age — and as Muslim populations become more economically capable , they will have to be dealt with as more than mere fundamentalists requiring planetary strategies for containment .
( Think separation walls on steroids . )
Parag Khanna and Fareed Zakaria got some of this down , as they note rising competition between established and insurgent economic powers over stretches of the world until now commonly disparaged .
But too little analysis goes beyond this framework , to the on - the - ground happenings within the Muslim world — with the welcome exception of Vali Nasr ’s brilliant Forces of Fortune : The Rise of the Muslim Middle Class and What It Will Mean For Our World ( Free Press , 2009 ) and Ben Simpfendorfer ’s intriguing The New Silk Road : How a Rising Arab World is Turning Away from the West and Rediscovering China ( Palgrave - Macmillan , 2009 ) .
The Wide Green Smudge
Simpfendorfer , fluent in Arabic and Chinese , is Chief China Economist at Royal Bank of Scotland , and has lived throughout the Middle East .
He brings a casual language that makes his arguments easy to process and a pleasure to read , communicating sensitivities about and intimacies with both regions that can not be faked .
Vali Nasr is among other things Professor of International Politics at Tufts ’ Fletcher School and part of Richard Holbrooke ’s Afghanistan - Pakistan team , whose recent works have received significant attention .
This , his most recent work , urges our reconsideration of the Muslim world by looking at its economic and social realities in another light .
Both offer the gravity , subtlety , and statistics that the discussion deserves .
We do not know what will become of the processes these authors point to , but we can after these books no longer deny that Muslim ( and Islamist ) politics are at once becoming , in some crucial circles , politically more refined , culturally more generous , and intellectually more democratic .
I gather these circles under the title of the “ Next Islamists , ” whose priorities are engineered by new economic forces , the consequence of trends that too many analysts discount on account of cultural smugness .
Simpfendorfer ’s slender book concerns itself with anecdotes , anthropology , and economics , informing us how new connections are organically emerging — in astonishing number — between rising Arabs , looking to invest massive sums of wealth in new markets , and risen China , a positive model for socially stable growth .
These links involve much more than oil alone ( Simpfendorfer makes much of the place of Islam in these relationships ) , but oil has produced the hundreds of billions that now constitute sovereign wealth funds taken seriously across the world .
For its tone , facts and implications ( if not its oddly inflated price ) Simpfendorfer ’s book is wonderful .
Islamic historian Richard Bulliett called it “ absolutely fascinating ” and “ stunning . ” I can not disagree .
The Next Islamism
If China becomes a new priority , an economic beacon and a political patron , what happens to the question of reconciling Islam and the West ?
As more wealthy Arabs consider investment in new markets , such as the “ Islamic Corridor ” — that wide green smudge from Atlantic West Africa to Indonesia — how will America be affected by new Muslim interests ?
This is where Nasr ’s timely contribution most clearly shines ; in Forces of Fortune , Nasr explores the deleterious effects of colonialism ( a topic on which Simpfendorfer is unfortunately silent ) and then despotism on retarding Muslim politics .
It ’s no surprise Islam is so preoccupied with the West .
For one way or another , it has been Western regimes that have dictated Muslim politics for a very long time .
Starting in the 1960s , though , a new Muslim politics began to emerge , shaped by a clash between Cold War overseers , unrepresentative national elites , and persecuted anti-state movements .
Initially , many of these movements resisted authoritarian states through explicitly secular discourses , equal parts national pride and socialist policy .
The resurgence of Muslimness took two forms : Islamist political movements , many of which inherited or seized the discourse of the left and rebranded it ( June 12 , 1967 : a great time to reintroduce an old product ) , and pietist movements concerned with the propagation of “ orthodox ” Muslim practices .
The pietism fed into and was fueled by Islamist politics , but ultimately the politics expanded because it claimed to defend the piety .
I believe the convergence of three realities has produced the Next Islamism , which , as Nasr and Simpfendorfer point out , we ignore to our own detriment :
First , pietism successfully revived religious practice , until it became everyday habit .
Second , political Islam failed to offer functional solutions to modern politics — Iran is , as Nasr said , the only real victory of the old - style of Islamism .
And , third , global capital flows empowered new economies , drawing wealth , power , and prestige away from the West , a process Simpfendorfer captures excellently .
The age of the Next Islamists is fundamentally unique .
It is a time when Indonesia is considered a near - future member of BRIC , Turkey is a top - 20 economy , Iran ’s turbaned government invests billions in embryonic stem - cell research , and Dubai hosts many of the world ’s most outstanding infrastructure .
We must come to terms with the consequences : practicing Muslims , who consume and produce a distinct worldview , and are more than capable of participating in global realities .
Whereas a few decades ago it was assumed that Islam would be secularized into oblivion , the opposite is true .
But now that the religion has stuck around long enough , it can no longer become the simple rallying cry it once was .
Take Iran , where of course the old - style Islamist discourse triumphed .
But the Revolution is now contested by the Next Islamists , an insurgency of former regime elements articulating their disagreements with the Islamic Republic and offering in its place a more democratic Islamic polity .
Few thought Iran could survive three decades out in the cold ( Nasr notes it is 151st of 160 on a scale of globally isolated economies ) and in that time build an elaborate welfare state , launch a satellite into orbit , and educate millions of young women through college and on to graduate school .
Now that they have done this , many young Iranians expect ( and deserve ) more .
Many do not ( yet ) see this expectation as at fundamentally and irreversibly at odds with their Islam .
More crucially , neither do their most influential opposition leaders .
Liberal Democracy , or Market Capitalism ?
It is not my intention to rehabilitate Fukuyama ’s assertion of the inevitable victory of liberal democracy , but I can take consolation in calling him out as half - correct , and still more satisfyingly , entirely unintentionally .
If ( for now ) all that is left is a certain social vision , then that vision is not so much liberal democracy as market capitalism .
And if that is the conclusion of our era of history , then this leaves America not at the apex , but as just one competitor among others .
The rest of the world can play the capitalist game , and judging by the progress of things , some parts of the planet are doing much better than we are .
This may then make for new alliances between the Next Islamists and the West ( so long as the West can break out of the thick teleology that demands we see the Muslim world as backwards and hostile . )
But if America ignores options for trade and commerce in place of suspicion and hectoring , we empower Russia , China , and our own slow obsolescence .
For China and Russia could become sources of anxiety for the Next Islamists , considering their authoritarianism as well as their treatment of some of their Muslim populations .
Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan slammed China for its treatment of the Uighurs , much as he chastised Israel over the Gaza crisis — yet in the latter case , he did not downgrade ties .
The Turkish Parliament turned down an American request to host part of the invasion of Iraq , and yet continues to push close ties with the West .
While Turks assert their right to practice a public Islam with a confidence that would have seemed unbelievable just a few decades back , these same Turks are not demanding the Islamic state we have understood by that term since 1979 .
They are keen to enhance the democracy their country has been building on its own resources , one that respects their unique historical achievements ( Ataturk managed to build an independent , modernizing republic when almost every other Muslim country was either colonized or petrified ) .
If American policy recognizes the role of the Next Islamists in building a wealthier Muslim world , we may find ourselves unsuspected partners .
For we are far away , as Simpfendorfer notes , missing out changes storming across Eurasia .
But our very distance could be welcome in an era of rising China , aggressive Russia , and their obvious proximity .
Engaging the World Beyond Our Coastlines
Consider Iran , which too often we read through a lens of inveterate mendacity .
Iran has strong ties with Russia and China .
China in particular needs to bring Iranian petrochemicals overland through Central Asia , lessening Chinese dependence on the Hormuz chokepoint and the Malaccan Straits .
But those same relationships which give Iran diplomatic cover — consider , really , how few options Barack Obama has to get Iran to the table — can also be an Achilles heel .
Iranians are in the process of debating what Islam their Republic is all about , in no small part because America is not the threat it once was .
When , on July 17 , Ayatollah Rafsanjani rose to deliver his long - awaited Friday sermon , some of his supporters responded to Basiji chants of “ Death to America ” with counter - chants of “ Death to Russia . ”
If Islam can mean democracy , then the enemy of Islam is not the West .
Members of the Green Movement asked why Iran ’s Islamic government cares so passionately for Palestinians , but refuses to extend its pan-Islamic sympathies to Uighurs under Chinese rule .
All Muslims are equal , but some Muslims are more equal than others .
The democratic implications of such logic are by any measure deeply unsettling .
We should be ready for them .
We must break free of a certain laziness that contains our potential for engaging the world beyond our coastlines .
Only a hard core of rigid secularization theorists or right - wing thinkers presumes Islam has no choice but to come to terms with a specific secular modernity ( or , and this is much the same , Islam has no choice but to forever oppose that modernity ) , but these few too often dominate the discussion .
It is to the contrary : Iranians , for example , do not have to doubt the ability of their culture and country to produce perceptive discourses .
Turks , Malaysians , Pakistanis ( remember the middle classes who pushed Musharraf out ? ) , and Indonesians stand shoulder to shoulder , for they are among those Muslim states that have seen a resurgence of religious practice coupled with movements announcing the compatibility of Islam with democracy .
Nasr and Simpfendorfer are speaking something about a Muslim future we hear of all too rarely .
As the Next Islamists expand , much of the rest of the Muslim world will be watching very , very closely — and their empowered middle classes , perceptive intellectuals and courageous activists will hold their own governments up for comparison .
Burning flags is so 1979 .

When Quigley and Damitry are discussing Murphy 's file , Quigley says Murphy along with 75 others were denounced in their case of being Elvis Presley 's biological children .
In his very next line Quigley says DNA testing eliminated 73 of the 75 outright .
Damitry then asks him if Murphy was one of the inconclusive 2 remaining defendants , to which Quigley responds by showing a picture of Murphy 's sideburns .
This exchange implies that there were only 75 defendants total when the earlier statement points to 76 .

Doomsday Clock Shows New Time
At 10:00 a.m. on Thursday BAS reset the famous " Doomsday Clock " to six minutes to midnight from its previous position of five minutes to midnight .
Doomsday Clock Shows New Time
This shift of one minute , the smallest adjustment in the history of the clock , indicates that the scientists are slightly more optimistic that the world might be able to address its problems and increase its security .
The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic clock face , maintained since 1947 by the board of directors of the people Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists at the University of Chicago .
The closer the clock is to midnight , the closer the world is estimated to be to global disaster .
Since its creation the time on the clock has changed 19 times .
Originally , the analogy represented the threat of global nuclear war , but since 2007 it has also reflected climate - changing technologies and " new developments in the life sciences and nanotechnology that could inflict irrevocable harm . "
Since its inception , the clock has been depicted on every cover of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists .
Its first representation was in 1947 , when magazine co-founder Hyman Goldsmith asked artist Martyl Langsdorf ( wife of Manhattan Project research associate and Szilárd petition signatory Alexander Langsdorf , Jr. ) to design a cover for the magazine 's June 1947 issue .
Daily Finance has contributed to the report .
What I would like to write about today is a subject I have been playing with for quite some time – Windows kernel vulnerability exploitation techniques .
While digging through various articles and other materials , I appeared to find bunches of interesting facts that are worth being described here .
The post presented today aims to describe various ways of obtaining kernel - mode addresses from the user - mode ( application ) level .
One could ask , what would we want to retrieve any internal system addresses for .
Well , it is indeed a very good question – as for me , the kernel addresses become most useful in the vulnerability exploitation process .
Since a majority of bugs found in device drivers belong , directly ( pointer validation ) or indirectly ( pool buffer overflow ) , to the write - what - where condition family , one must know the exact address to be overwritten before performing the operation .
This basically means that the more information about kernel memory layout we can gather , the more stable and effective attacks can be conducted .
The idea I am writing about is not new , for sure .
A great part of kernel exploits programmers has already used such techniques in their source code .
However , I have n’t ever found any publication that would thoroughly describe every possible vector of obtaining somewhat “ sensitive ” kernel data ( addresses ) from within user - mode .
Hence , I would like to present a short introduction of each method I could think of – a longer article will presumably be released within a few days .
Huh , let ’s get to the point , already !
NtQuerySystemInformation function
Before trying to retrieve any information from the kernel , one should firstly realize , what are the possible “ communication channels ” , that could be used to get the desired data from .
The most basic method division could look like this :
Kernel communication – calling some of the exported system routines and receive the data we are interested in , through the output buffer
Processor communication – directly using some of the processor characteristics ( i.e. instruction set ) in order to query for some processor - specific values that the system is obliged to fill .
All in all , the kernel is n’t meant to release too much information about itself to the user ( since every leaked piece of data could potentially help the attacker to hack the machine ) ; due to this fact , there are special routines designed to handle queries about the system state , configuration etc .
As it turns out , these system calls ( named NtQuery * Information ) can provide very miscellaneous kinds of information that not every low - level coder is aware of .
I strongly advice you to take a look and test the functions below , using many different arguments :
Even thought these syscalls are either documented very poorly or not documented at all , some independent researchers have already managed to describe a great part of them – their work is publicly available , for example here .
For our purposes ( global system info ) , the last function on the list seems to be the most useful one – it is , indeed .
As one can see , the first routine parameter is _SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS – a single enum containing all the possible request types , shown below :
typedef enum _SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS
{ SystemInformationClassMin = 0 , SystemBasicInformation = 0 , SystemProcessorInformation = 1 , SystemPerformanceInformation = 2 , SystemTimeOfDayInformation = 3 , SystemPathInformation = 4 , SystemNotImplemented1 = 4 , SystemProcessInformation = 5 , SystemProcessesAndThreadsInformation = 5 , SystemCallCountInfoInformation = 6 , SystemCallCounts = 6 , SystemDeviceInformation = 7 , SystemConfigurationInformation = 7 , SystemProcessorPerformanceInformation = 8 , SystemProcessorTimes = 8 , SystemFlagsInformation = 9 , SystemGlobalFlag = 9 , SystemCallTimeInformation = 10 , SystemNotImplemented2 = 10 , SystemModuleInformation = 11 , SystemLocksInformation = 12 , SystemLockInformation = 12 , SystemStackTraceInformation = 13 , SystemNotImplemented3 = 13 , SystemPagedPoolInformation = 14 , SystemNotImplemented4 = 14 , SystemNonPagedPoolInformation = 15 , SystemNotImplemented5 = 15 , SystemHandleInformation = 16 , SystemObjectInformation = 17 , SystemPageFileInformation = 18 , SystemPagefileInformation = 18 , SystemVdmInstemulInformation = 19 , SystemInstructionEmulationCounts = 19 , SystemVdmBopInformation = 20 , ( ... ) } SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS
;
( you can find the complete definition in the standard ddk
tapi.h header file ) .
As the name implies , there are really plenty of information to get – the only thing required is the knowledge of how to the input / output structures for each request looks like .
At this point , we are particularly interested in three query types – SystemModuleInformation , SystemHandleInformation and SystemLocksInformation .
Moreover , SystemObjectInformation could be also useful , under specific circumstances .
Let ’s go through these requests and find out , what information can we get .
SystemModuleInformation
As far as my observations go , this request is the most commonly used type , across kernel - mode exploits .
To understand why , one should first take a look at what this operation returns :
typedef struct _SYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION_ENTRY
{ ULONG Unknown1 ; ULONG Unknown2 ; PVOID Base ; ULONG Size ; ULONG Flags ; USHORT Index ; /* Length of module name not including the path , this field contains valid value only for NTOSKRNL module */ USHORT NameLength ; USHORT LoadCount ; USHORT PathLength ; CHAR ImageName [ 256 ] ; } SYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION_ENTRY , *PSYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION_ENTRY;</p> typedef struct _SYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION
{ ULONG Count ; SYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION_ENTRY
Module [ 1 ] ; } SYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION , *PSYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION ;
What the listing presents is a main structure , containing the number of module information entries returned .
Right after this value , Count SYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION_ENTRY
structures follow , each containing information about one , specific executable image , loaded inside the kernel - mode address space .
As the names themselves suggest , after calling NtQuerySystemInformation ( SystemModuleInformation , … ) and passing a properly - sized buffer , the application obtains the Name , ImageBase and ImageSize of every single device driver ( excluding those that are hidden by rootkits , of course ; ) ) .
This includes the very first Windows kernel images like ntosknrl.exe ( or other types of the system core ) , HAL.dll ( hardware support ) , win32k.sys ( std graphic device driver ) and so on .
Because of the fact that most write - what - where attacks are based on modyfing the ntosknrl .
exe memory regions ( such as the [ HalDispatchTable + 4 ] technique ) , obtaining the kernel ImageBase value is an essential part of the entire exploitation .
Some very educational articles covering kernel - mode exploitation techniques can be found here ( Analyzing local privilege escalations in win32 k ) , here ( Exploiting Common Flaws in Drivers ) and here ( Exploiting Windows Device Drivers ) .
SystemHandleInformation
Another interesting request type , already used by some rootkit detection mechanisms ( RootkitAnalytics.com ) .
The general purpose is providing information about all the active HANDLE objects present in the system memory .
Performing a NtQuerySystemInformation( SystemHandleInformation , … ) will result in filling the output buffer with structures of the following definition :
typedef struct _SYSTEM_HANDLE_INFORMATION
{ ULONG ProcessId ; UCHAR ObjectTypeNumber ; UCHAR Flags ; USHORT Handle ; PVOID Object ; ACCESS_MASK GrantedAccess ; } SYSTEM_HANDLE_INFORMATION , *PSYSTEM_HANDLE_INFORMATION ;
Not too many fields , this time ; however , the most important part of the struct is present – PVOID Object .
This is where we can find another kernel - mode pointer ( inaccessible from user - mode , of course ) .
Apart from the address itself , the HANDLE is also described with the creator process ID , type of the object and most importantly – the HANDLE value itself .
Therefore , the object identification is very easy to perform and should not cause too much of a problem to the coder .
More information will follow in the upcoming paper :)
SystemLocksInformation
This time , what we are getting is the information regarding locks used by the kernel .
Locks in Windows are special “ multiple reader single writer ” synchronization mechanisms , otherwise known as “ resources ” .
The output structure definition follows :
typedef struct _SYSTEM_LOCK_INFORMATION
{ PVOID Address ; USHORT Type ; USHORT Reserved1 ; ULONG ExclusiveOwnerThreadId ; ULONG ActiveCount ; ULONG ContentionCount ; ULONG Reserved2 [ 2 ] ; ULONG NumberOfSharedWaiters ; ULONG NumberOfExclusiveWaiters ; } SYSTEM_LOCK_INFORMATION , *PSYSTEM_LOCK_INFORMATION ;
where the PVOID Address value points to a ERESOURCE structure in the kernel memory .
These structures can be initialized using the ExInitializeResourceLite routine and are said to be documented in DDK ( Windows NT 2000 Native API Reference ) .
These are , more or less , all the places ( known by me ) , one can request K - M addresses from .
Even though only three sources could seem to be little , it is enough to create a really impressive ( imho ) kernel memory map , as you will see in a few minutes .
If you – the blog reader – are aware of any other kind of system information request leading to kernel address “ leak ” , please let me know through e-mail / post comments – I will be more than happy to add it to this list .
Processor specific structures
Apart from asking the system kernel to provide some information about its memory layout , one can also use direct application -> processor communication in order to read addresses related to some of the architectural structures that the system has to implement to work correctly .
To be more precise , these structures are Global Descriptor Table ( per processor / core ) and Interrupt Descriptor Table ( per processor / core ) plus structures implemented inside GDT ( Task State Segment , Local Descriptor Table etc ) .
To start playing with these structures , one should begin by reading Intel Software Developer ’s Manuals : Volume 1 ( Basic Architecture ) and Volume 3A , 3B ( System Programming Guide ) – all of these can be found here .
The most interesting instructions here appear to be SGDT and SIDT , storing the GDTR and IDTR registers in user - specified memory .
What is more , the system itself also makes some segment - related API functions available ; these are :
GetThreadSelectorEntry – documented
NtSetLdtEntries – undocumented
?
It should be noted ( once more ) , that each processor has its own GDT / IDT structure .
Hence , in order to retrieve all the addresses possible , it is necessary to make sure that a specified thread / routine is executed in the context of a chosen processor .
This can be achieved by using SetThreadAffinityMask or SetProcessAffinity Mask API functions .
Please refer to the KernelMAP source code to get more information about how to implement it in practice .
KernelMAP v0.0.1
Despite some strictly theoretical deliberations , I would also like to present a simple program of mine .
Its main purpose is to gather all ( or most , at least ) information about kernel - mode memory layout and show it to the user in the most attractive way possible .
The application consists of two windows : the first , text window prints some basic , statistical information based on the data provided by kernel .
Second , graphical window is responsible for the real visualization .
Its size is equal 1024 ×512 ( 400×200 hexdecimally ) , and every virtual page is represented by a single pixel on the board .
These pixels have various colors associated to themselves , depending on what type of data the page in consideration contains .
As the above description might not give you any idea of how it looks like on a real system , some screenshots from various systems follow :
Some strictly technical info : this program is designed to be compiled using MinGW GCC compiler and is probably not MS VC ++ compatible .
In order to make it work correctly , the program needs to find the SDL.dll , libpng3.dll and zlib1.dll libraries – you can find them inside the package .
A complete ZIP file , including the source code , executable and external DLL files can be downloaded from here ( 387kB )
Since I am myself very curious about how the kernel memory layout looks like on different systems that I do n’t have access to , you should feel encouraged to make your own shot and share ( I hope this is not too much of information disclosure ; D ) .
Furthermore , if you find any bugs in the existing code , or would like it to be extended with some additional functionalities ( like new kernel addresses I do n’t know about , yet ) , please let me know .
Every single comment is very welcome !
Have fun !
A Canadian company , the Bontan Oil and Gas Company , based in Toronto , has found what could be up to $ 6 billion dollars worth off natural gas off the coast of Israel .
This could mean even cleaner energy for Israel which has no formal diplomatic relations with its Arab neighbours who own oil .
While natural gas is not the cleanest fuel out there , it does burn cleaner than oil .
The Jerusalem Post reports that the Canadian company had been exploring for natural gas off the coast of Israel , and announced yesterday that it had located what appears to be up to 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas off Israel 's coast in two separate sites .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Worth up to $ 6 billion , a press release on the companyâ€™s website announced that it " will have an indirect 71.625 % interest in these prospects via its 75 % equity interest in the Israel Petroleum Company which has acquired a 95.5 % interest in the drilling licenses as well as an adjoining exploration permit from the current operator subject to approval by the Government of Israel . "

9 Aug 11 - Although I ran this article back in 2007 , I think it 's worth running again .
Thanks to Dr Mirco Poletto in Italy for reminding me of it .
15 Oct 07 - " Mont Blanc glacier almost doubles in size in four years . "
That ’s what the headline should have said .
Instead , it shouted " Global warming makes Mont Blanc grow , " in what I consider a blatant attempt to hide the truth .
A different paper entitled the story " Climate change making Mont Blanc even higher . "
Here ’s how the stories went :
" Mont Blanc , the highest mountain in France and western Europe , has grown more than two metres in two years ... ironically as a result of global warming . "
" Generations of French schoolchildren were taught the famous peak was 4,807 metres tall , but it has been growing since 2003 and at a faster rate in recent months .
" The volume of ice on Mont Blanc 's slopes over 4800 metres high was first calculated at 14,600 cubic metres in 2003 .
It dropped to 14,300 cubic metres two years later , but then almost doubled to 24,100 cubic metres in 2007 .
The volume of ice has almost doubled in size in four years !
Such " growth " in mountains is specific to higher Alpine peaks , said Yan Giezendanner , a meteorologist .
" Glaciers at high altitude seem to be growing , while those situated at mid or low altitude are melting , shrinking and threatened with extinction , " he said .
You decide .
Were those headlines dishonest ?

Before we move on to the more complex issue and explain how the credit limit works , we will first try to answer the basic question : what is the credit limit ?
Simply put , it is an additional amount of funds available on your account that you can use if needed .
The mere fact of granting a credit limit does not mean that you have to use it every month or use it immediately .
You can use it according to your needs because these funds are available directly on your account in the form of debt .
How to get the limit ?
Any adult who is a customer of a given bank ( has an account or is a co-owner ) , has a regular income and lives on Polish territory can apply for the limit .
You and the bank decide how high the personal account limit will be .
This amount is usually calculated on the basis of your creditworthiness – first of all , regular inflows to your account are taken into account .
The limit may also be affected by additional factors such as seniority of the account or your possession of other financial products of this institution .
You can apply for a credit limit at a branch of a specific bank , or ( in some cases ) via electronic banking .
If you do not have a limit yet , the bank usually prepares an offer for you , which is available online with a few clicks .
Credit limit – costs and commissions
In fact , you can apply for a credit limit on your personal account at any bank .
This product is so popular that banks do not regulate what the customer will spend these funds on , as everyone has the right to use them at their own discretion .
By default , the funds available within the credit limit should always be “ on hand ” .
However , this privilege can cost a lot .
Account credit limit – fees
Fortunately , the mere possession of a credit limit does not involve additional fees .
The bank only charges them when you start using it and only from the part you used .
If we assume that your limit is USD 2,000 and you have used half of it , the commission will be calculated only on the USD 1,000 used .
The account limit is fortunately not as expensive as it may seem .
It is also often more profitable than a cash loan .
The interest rate on the limit is usually around 12 – 16 % , while the APRC of cash loans is often 18 % , and there are also more expensive offers .
The credit limit on personal and company accounts
An account with a credit limit is really everyday life among financial products .
If you do not have a personal account yet or have not used the credit limit , you should think about which bank has prepared the best promotion in this area .
Banks wanting to attract new customers often offer them a limited account .
This means that as a new customer of the bank and not using any financial products , you immediately receive a kind of trust loan and a credit limit is assigned to your account .
Such an offer has been prepared .
The offers of other banks are also popular , where within the credit limit we can be given a really large sum .
The Good Credit Bank has prepared a proposition for its clients : the Good Credit credit limit – up to USD 150,000 in additional cash .
If you are interested in large limits , you can also check the Fine Bank credit limit .
The bank grants up to USD 50,000 limit , and currently , the “ Welcome offer ” promotion is underway , thanks to which you can use an individual credit line without a commission for granting the limit .
If we look deeper , we can see that E - Money has just prepared a spring promotion E - Money credit limit – up to 90 days without interest ( APR 9.99 % ) .
In addition , he provided customers with a revolving loan calculator so that they can easily and quickly check all loan costs .
And what does the limit case look like for business accounts ?
It will be difficult to find a company account with a credit limit for starters , but it is not difficult to find a revolving loan offer that works in company accounts on the financial services market .
An example would be E - Money , which grants companies a limit from day 1 , provided that the creditworthiness is assessed positively .
Under this limit , you can get up to USD 150,000 .
Credit limit – summary
Credit limits are a good option for people who want to have a security cushion in case of unplanned expenses .
When time plays a major role , you will not need to complete documents , apply for a loan , and wait for a decision .
The account limit can be dangerous , however , if at some point you overdo the expenses and the total credit limits exceed your monthly inflows .
This will mean that you are unable to pay back the used limit on an ongoing basis , and the last option will be a consolidation loan .
Remember that if you belong to people who spend money very quickly and who have on their account , it is better to give up the limit at all .
Late repayments , apart from additional costs , also generate additional problems .
Failure to meet the repayment deadline will definitely be recorded in the Credit Information Bureau and will have a direct impact on your creditworthiness .
Therefore , if you really need additional funds and you do not trust yourself in this matter , it is better to use a one - time cash loan instead of a revolving limit .
Camouflage has always been a wonder to us .
It allows animals and plants to remain indiscernible from the surrounding environment through deception .
Adopting this concept , a new wave of camouflage artists use special techniques for their photographs that allow them to show people blended into their surroundings .
For each photo , the camouflage artist must meticulously design a new camouflage suit in order for the effect to work .
This article features the work of two prominent camouflage artists : Liu Bolin and Desiree Palmen .
See if you can find the people in these photographs …
Liu Bolin
Liu Bolin is a Chinese artist who creates art in protest to the actions of the Chinese government , who shut his studio down in 2005 .
He will work on a single photograph for up to ten hours , and often pedestrians will not notice him until they actually run into him .
F
Desiree Palmen
Desiree Palmen is a talented Dutch artist who also uses photography to produce her camouflage art .
She patiently paints the camouflage on by hand on cotton suits , matching them to the background .
Compiled exclusively for WDD by Zoe Ajiboye .

A NEW solar cell that imitates Mother Nature ’s way of converting sunlight to energy is making its debut in a variety of consumer products .
The technology uses a photosensitive dye to start its energy production , much the way leaves use chlorophyll to begin photosynthesis .
The dye - sensitized cells will be used to provide power for devices ranging from e-book readers to cellphones  and will take some interesting forms .
For e-book readers , for example , the cells may be found in thin , flexible panels stitched into the reader ’s cover .
But such panels will also be housed in new lines of backpacks and sports bags , where they can recharge devices like cellphones and music players .
The technology , long in development , will work best in full , direct sunshine , said Dr. Michael Grätzel , a chemist and professor at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland .
But the cells will also make good use of dappled and ambient light , including the indoor light of fluorescent bulbs , he said .
I was working on a lot sizing problem today and implemented a Wagner - Whitin algorithm in Resolver One .
I just want to share it with you here .
Some people use a MIP solver to solve lot sizing problems while Wagner and Whitin have devised an algorithm that can be implemented quickly on a spreadsheet and there is no need to use an expensive solver .
You can download the spreadsheet from this link .
In the classical lot sizing problem we have the following assumptions :
We have a single product ( with the production quantity in period t ) Discrete Time ( unlike EOQ model )
Demand is known but varies over time ( e.g. , we have orders )
No shortage is allowed No capacity constraints
There is a positive setup cost that might be varying over time
The unit production cost is constant
The objective is to minimize the total setup cost and inventory costs
Here is the formulation for the model :
setup cost in period t inventory holding cost per unit remaining at end of period t demand in period t a large number ( will be used in the MIP model ) production quantity in period t if and is 0 otherwise inventory remaining at the end of period t
The MIP model will be :
Wagner and Whitin have solved this problem using the forward dynamic programming .
In this spreadsheet we implement the forward dynamic programming for the lot sizing problem .
The spreadsheet then suggests the time period than it is optimal to pay for the setup cost , in other time periods it is cheaper to carry an inventory .

There I stood , homeless with my Prada case
The other night , I found myself homeless .
It was n't the sort of homelessness that meant I was fleeing an abusive home , or had found myself unable to cope with normal life due to drugs or drink .
But I was still cold , stranded , ostracised .
It was the Monday before Christmas and I 'd caught the train to London for work .
Knowing I had to be in town the following day , I turned up at the fairly cheap hotel in Shepherd 's Bush I always stay in for work .
They know me here : they valet - park and clean my BMW and understand I require soya milk with my cornflakes .
As I handed the bellboy my Prada suitcase , the man at reception asked for a credit card .
It was declined .
I gave him another one .
Declined .
I offered him a debit card but he said his machine would n't take it .
Protective veneer : Liz Jones is used to being treated in a certain way because of nice clothes , expensive luggage , car and credit cards
He shuffled away and came back with the manager .
' But you know me , ' I said to her .
' I always stay here . '
' I do n't remember you , ' she said .
' We can not let you stay without taking the money first .
Why do n't you walk to a cashpoint ? '
I left my suitcase hostage and walked to the cashpoint in my difficult shoes .
' The amount you can withdraw today is NIL . '
Oh dear .
I called my bank manager .
He was kind but said I would not be able to withdraw money until the next day .
I walked back to the hotel .
I 'm used to being treated in a certain way because of my protective veneer of nice clothes , expensive luggage , car , credit cards , but for the first time I could feel what it 's like to have nothing .
People look at you with disgust , pity , horror .
Actually , not with that much pity , to be honest .
' I could n't withdraw any money but I 'm sure it will be fine in the morning , ' I told the manager .
' I'm really sorry , ' she said .
' But what am I going to do ? '
I wailed .
' You can wait in the bar until you figure out who you can call . '
So I sat in the bar but everything I had taken for granted - waving at the waiter to order a drink , phoning for a cab , looking forward to a hot bath and a warm pillow - seemed terribly far away .
Then the waitress came over and said , in a thick Polish accent : ' If you are not a guest and you are not going to order a drink , you will have to leave . '
Liz Jones :
As I handed the bellboy my Prada suitcase , the man at reception asked for a credit card .
It was declined
I picked up my bag , collected my case with as much dignity as I could muster and went out on to the pavement .
The wind whipped around my legs and it was suddenly very dark .
I had been tossed on to life 's rubbish tip .
For the first time , I felt what it must be like to be homeless , to have no money , no one to turn to .
I realised that this was about the worst thing that can happen to you .
Your humanity is stripped away and you become something to be moved along , stepped over , ignored .
I had reached my low spot through my own stupidity .
I had spent too much money and was temporarily broke ( my agent eventually turned up to bail me out ) .
But while the plight of the homeless has gone out of fashion in recent years , it has n't gone away .
Thousands of people still end up on the street because of mental illness , addiction , abuse or sheer bad luck .
And so , while it would be easy to condemn as condescending Prince William 's experiment last week with homelessness to highlight the 40th anniversary of Centrepoint , a charity once championed by his mother , I think the fact that he was willing to sleep in an alley , shielded by wheelie bins , was incredibly brave .
Only when you are faced with the prospect of even one night on the pavement can you begin to understand what it 's like to be down on your luck .
In this economic downturn , the realisation that the world is indeed a cold , unforgiving place is beginning to dawn on more and more of us .
And it 's a scary place to be .
We had just put the kids in the bathtub when Special Agent Robert Flaherty knocked on my front door with a subpoena .
He was very polite , and used “ sir ” a lot , and he said he just wanted a name :
Who sent me the security directive ?
I invited Flaherty to sit down in the living room and introduced him to my cats , who seemed to take a liking to him .
The kids came by to say hello , too .

“ A subpoena ? ” I asked the special agent .
“ Is that really necessary ? ”
“ Sir , ” he repeated .
“ You ’ve been served . ”
Alright , then .
I ’ve been served .
Here ’s the full text of the subpoena :
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Department of Homeland Security
Transportation Security Administration SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM YOU ARE HEREBY COMMANDED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR , TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION , UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY , to produce and permit inspection and copying of the records described below to Special Agent Robert Flaherty , TSA Office of Inspection , Transportation Security Admininistration , 580 T G Lee Blvd , Suite 610 , Orlando , Florida 32822 ( Phone # : 407-563-4096 ) , email : [ email protected ] , no later than COB December 31 , 2009 , in furtherance of an official investigation :
All documents , emails , and / or faxsimile transmissions ( sic ) in your control possession or control concerning your receipt of TSA Security Directive 1544 -09 - 06 dated December 25 , 2009 .
IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF , the undersigned , an officer designated by the Transportation Security Administration , has hereunto set his hand in the county of Arlington , Virginia , this 29th day of December , 2009 .
Dan Kuntz
Senior Counsel – Civil Enforcement
Transportation Security Administration
U.S. Department of Homeland Security AUTHORITY
This subpoena is issued under the authority contained in 49 U.S.C. §§ 40113 and 46104 ; and 49 C.F.R § 1503.3 .
Any person who neglects or refuses to produce records in obedience to this subpoena is subject to fines under Title 18 , United States Code , imprisonment for not more than one year , or both , 49 U.S.C § 46313 .
( For those of you who did n’t go to law school or take Latin , a subpoena duces tecum — Latin for “ bring with you under penalty of punishment ” — is form of a subpoena issued by a court ordering the parties named to appear and produce tangible evidence for use at a hearing or trial . )
So if I ’m reading this correctly , the TSA wants me to tell them who gave me the security directive .
I told Flaherty I ’d call my attorney and get back to him .
What would you do ?
( Incidentally , my kids liked Special Agent Flaherty .
They ’ve been calling him “ our friend from the TSA ” all evening .
Probably because he had a cool badge and got along with the cats . )

Our thin -skinned Supreme Court .
WASHINGTON --
The nation owes a substantial debt to Justice Samuel Alito for his display of unhappiness over President Obama 's criticisms of the Supreme Court 's recent legislation -- excuse me , decision -- opening our electoral system to a new torrent of corporate money .
Alito 's inability to restrain himself during the State of the Union address brought to wide attention a truth that too many have tried to ignore :
The Supreme Court is now dominated by a highly politicized conservative majority intent on working its will , even if that means ignoring precedents and the wishes of the elected branches of government .
Obama called the court on this , and Alito shook his head and apparently mouthed " not true . "
His was the honest reaction of a judicial activist who believes he has the obligation to impose his version of right reason on the rest of us .
The controversy also exposed the impressive capacity of the conservative judicial revolutionaries to live by double standards without apology .
The movement 's legal theorists and politicians have spent more than four decades attacking alleged judicial abuses by liberals , cheering on the presidents who joined them in their assaults .
But now , they are terribly offended that Obama has straightforwardly challenged the handiwork of their judicial comrades .
COATBRIDGE , Scotland —
What is it about Buckfast Tonic
Wine that makes it so alluring to consumers and yet so repulsive to politicians ?
Perhaps it is its special caffeine - and - sweet - wine recipe , which allows overly enthusiastic consumers to be tipsy and bouncy at the same time .
Perhaps it is its array of snappy nicknames , including “ Wreck the Hoose Juice ” — hoose being a Scottish pronunciation of house — or its exotic provenance as the product of wine - making Benedictine monks at an abbey in England .
Whatever the cause , Buckfast has emerged as a symbol of Scotland ’s entrenched drinking problems at a time when it is urgently debating how to address them .
“ For a large section of the Scottish population , their relationship with alcohol is damaging and harmful — to individuals , families , communities and to Scotland as a nation , ” the Scottish government said in a recent report .
Buckfast does not seem to help .
In a survey last year of 172 prisoners at a young offenders ’ institution , 43 percent of the 117 people who drank alcohol before committing their crimes said they had drunk Buckfast .
In a study of litter in a typical housing project , 35 percent of the items identified were Buckfast bottles .
And the police in the depressed industrial district of Strathclyde recently told a BBC program that the drink had been mentioned in 5,638 crime reports between 2006 and 2009 ( the bottle was used as a weapon in 114 of them ) .
My secret santa knows I 've always been fascinated by astronomy and starry nights since I was a kid but it 's very difficult to see any star at all in a light polluted metropolitan city like here in Hong Kong .
My gift is a dream come true !
Thanks very much ! :)
That ’s from al Jazeera ; here ’s the Guardian ‘s account :
The US military ’s takeover of emergency operations in Haiti has triggered a diplomatic row with countries and aid agencies furious at having flights redirected .
Brazil and France lodged an official ­protest with Washington after US military aircraft were given priority at Port - au - Prince ’s congested airport , forcing many non-US flights to divert to the Dominican Republic .
Brasilia warned it would not ­relinquish command of UN forces in Haiti , and Paris complained the airport had become a US “ annexe ” , exposing a brewing power struggle amid the global relief effort .
The Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières also complained about diverted flights .
[ snip ]
Frustration over aid bottlenecks among donors became tinged by national rivalry as it became clear the US was taking ownership of the crisis .
A vanguard of more than 1,000 US troops was on the ground and 12,000 were expected in the region by today , including marines aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson which anchored offshore as a “ floating airport ” .
The Haitian government , paralysed by the destruction of the presidential palace and ministries , signed a memorandum of understanding formally transferring control of Toussaint L’Ouverture airport to the US .
Former president Bill Clinton said he will travel to Haiti today to meet with government officials and deliver much - needed emergency supplies .
[ snip ]
The Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières complained about flights with medical staff and equipment which were redirected to the Dominican Republic .
“ We are all going crazy , ” said Nan Buzard , of the American Red Cross .
The Obama administration has enlisted former presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton to spearhead relief efforts .
In a series of interviews both men deflected right - wing accusations that the White House was seeking political advantage from the disaster .
“ I ’d say now is not the time to focus on politics , ” Bush said , as he sat beside his predecessor .
“ You ’ve got children who ’ve lost parents .
People wondering where they ’re going to be able to drink water . ”
The militarisation of the response is of course reminiscent of the Katrina disaster ( you might recall Bush had something to do with that ) .
Dave Eggers ’ book Zeitoun puts a human face on what happened in New Orleans by telling the story of one Syrian American resident .
Abdulrahman Zeitoun remained in the city after his family ( and most other residents ) left , hoping to protect his property and their business .
In the chaos , he managed to pull many survivors to safety in his canoe .
When six armed officers arrive at his house , he thought that help had come at last .
Instead , he was arrested on suspicion of terrorism ( he was Syrian , after all ) and then detained in Guantanamo - type conditions , without his family ’s knowledge .
On the one hand , the authorities had ignored and neglected New Orleans ’ safety for years ; on the other , when disaster struck , they approached the catastrophe through a military paradigm .
In New Orleans , just as today , the justification for sending the military was the supposed lawlessness of the survivors .
You ’ll remember that , in the first days after Katrina , the news then was also dominated by reports of looting .
Here ’s Rebecca Solnit from the Guardian :
The story , as the mainstream media presented it at the time , was about marauding hordes of looters , rapists and murderers swarming through the streets .
The descriptions were pretty clearly focused on African - Americans , the great majority left behind in the evacuation of the city ( which was then two - thirds black anyway ) .
There were supposed to be a lot of murder victims and murderers in the Superdome , the sports stadium the city opened up as a refuge of last resort .
The rumours were believed so fervently that they were used to turn New Orleans into a prison city , with supplies and would - be rescuers prevented from entering and the victims prevented from evacuating .
The belief that a Hobbesian war of all - against - all had broken loose justified treating the place as a crime zone or even a hostile country rather than a place in which grandmothers and toddlers were stranded in hideous conditions , desperately in need of food , water , shelter and medical attention .
Louisiana ’s governor at the time , Kathleen Blanco , announced as she dispatched National Guard troops : “ I have one message for these hoodlums : these troops know how to shoot and kill , and they are more than willing to do so if necessary , and I expect they will . ”
She and the city ’s mayor had called off the rescue efforts to focus on protecting private property – with lethal force if necessary .
The sheriff of the suburb across the Crescent City Connection bridge from downtown New Orleans turned back stranded tourists and locals at gunpoint .
“ As we approached the bridge , ” wrote two stranded paramedics , “ armed Gretna sheriffs formed a line across the foot of the bridge .
Before we were close enough to speak , they began firing their weapons over our heads . ”
Katrina was a fairly terrible natural disaster .
But it turned into a horrific social catastrophe because of the response of the people in power , spurred on by their willingness to believe a hysterical , rumour - mongering media .
( Journalists on the ground were often fiercely empathic and right on the mark , but those at a remove were all too willing to believe the usual tsunami of cliches about disaster and human nature . )
The story that few can wrap their minds around is that ordinary people mostly behaved well – there were six bodies in the Superdome , including four natural deaths and a suicide , not the hundreds that the federal government expected when it sent massive refrigerator trucks to collect the corpses .
On the other hand , people in power behaved appallingly , panicking , spreading rumours , and themselves showing an eagerness to kill and a pathological lack of empathy .
Amusingly , the New Orleans Police Department stripped a Cadillac dealership of its cars , some of which were found as far away as Texas .
Less amusingly , they shot a couple of unarmed – and , of course , black – family groups on the Danziger Bridge shortly after the storm in the only such incident to receive much press coverage .
A middle - aged mother had her forearm blown off ; a mentally disabled 40 - year - old on his way to his brother ’s dental office was shot five times in the back and died , and a teenager was also killed .
Truth , the first casualty of war , is pretty imperilled in disasters , too .
One group of suburban white men who believed the rumours or just anticipated that in the absence of authority we all become monsters became monsters themselves , even as they fantasised they were preserving order .
These men in Algiers Point across the river from the city of New Orleans gathered an arsenal and launched their own little murder spree , killing several black men and injuring and threatening others .
They were the real rampaging gangs , and they were not shy about what they did – they boasted of it to videographers and have talked openly about it since .
And with confidence , since there have to date been no legal repercussions .
They claimed to be defending their property and their neighbourhood , but their most vocal surviving victim , Donnell Herrington , was an armoured truck driver trying to evacuate after he had stayed behind to take care of his grandparents .
Herrington , who rescued those grandparents and dozens of neighbours by boat from their flooded apartment complex , then tried to find an evacuation point in Algiers for himself , and was shot twice at close range with a shotgun and nearly bled to death before neighbours got him to the hospital .
The vigilantes shot him because he was black , and because they could get away with it , and because they were inflamed by the news accounts .
In an interesting interview with the US CampusProgress magazine , the sociologist Kathleen Tierney points out that there ’s an academic body of research into the reporting of natural disasters .
She says :
If you go back to the 1950s and you look at some of those writings , a lot of it ’s about disaster myths — what people say happens in disasters versus what really happens .
What these researchers discovered was that the media — even way back in the 1950s and 1960s — approached huge disasters with certain frames .
When the media reports on disasters , they ’re inevitably going to focus on the dramatic and antisocial , even if it ’s one percent of the population committing these acts .
And even back then , the looting myth always came to the fore of media reports . [… ]
There is an institutionalized racism in the way these poor black disaster victims are treated .
The victims of Katrina were treated with so much presumption , as if you could assume they were going to loot , because they were black .
Just like we know that the people in Haiti are bad because they ’re black .
Black men especially are demonized .
During Katrina , the media picked up on every rumor — whether it was raped 4 - year - olds in the Superdome or people shooting each other .
Actually , for a paper me and a couple of my graduate students wrote called “ Metaphors Matter , ” we found some transcripts of TV programs in which members of the media expressed regret .
They were saying , “ We really blew it during Katrina ; we acted on all of these rumors . ”
I myself was on Jim Lehrer ’s show , where they were asking about the looting [ in Katrina ] , and I got into it with a police officer , and he ended up agreeing with me that it was a myth .
It ’s not real .
I thought the media would have learned something after Katrina , but evidently they have n’t .
Here we go again .
Here we go again , indeed .
Consider this account ( h/t , Lenin ’s Tomb ) , headlined ‘ Hatian Violence Hampers Earthquake Relief Efforts ’ .
That spin comes from US Southern Command Lieutenant General Ken Keen , who says ‘ [ looting ] is a concern and we are going to have to address it . ’
There ’s also a description of Haitian police firing on looters and killing someone .
But then comes this :
The American Red Cross set up a land bridge between Haiti and the Dominican Republic and is flying supplies into Santo Domingo and transporting them to Port - au - Prince , a journey that takes about 10 to 12 hours , said Nadia Pontif , a Red Cross spokeswoman , in a telephone interview .
About seven truckloads of supplies , which include tarps , cooking utensils , blankets , food and water , arrived in Port - au - Prince this morning are being distributed from a camp set up outside the airport , Pontif said .
“ We have n’t had any security issues at all , ” said Abi Weaver , an American Red Cross spokeswoman , in a telephone interview .
This is not to suggest that all Haitians are behaving like angels .
Doubtless , there is some criminality .
But as Tierney asks :
why are people so quick to demonize people who are living in abject poverty , people whose everyday life is a disaster ?
And now that they ’ve experienced a new catastrophe , why are we focusing on this ?
It ’s incomprehensible to me .
The way that highfalutin academics talk about it is that there are changes in societal norms about property in very , very severe disasters .
For example , I was watching CNN , and there was a CNN reporter that was talking about a Haitian hotel that brought a hose out for people to take water from if they came by .
Were those people looting water ?
I ’d say no .
The norms changed .
What if people are together in a group and they decide that they need to go get some rice .
Is it looting to get rice and feed your family in desperate situations ?
No .
It ’s a new norm developing in the midst of a very extreme situation .
Indeed , there seems to be considerable evidence that , in the face of an appalling catastrophe , Haitians are actually co-operating to help each other survive .
See , for example , this account :
In the absence of any visible relief effort in the city , the help came from small groups of Haitians working together .
Citizens turned into aid workers and rescuers .
Lone doctors roamed the streets , offering assistance .
The Red Cross estimates that 45,000 to 50,000 people were killed in Tuesday ’s earthquake , with some three million others left homeless and in need of food and water .
At the crumbling national cathedral , a dozen men and women crowded around a man swinging a pickaxe to pry open the space for a dusty , near - dead looking woman to squeeze through and escape .
The night of the quake , a group of friends pulled bricks out from under a collapsed home , clearing a narrow zig - zagging path towards the sound of a child crying out beneath the rubble .
Two buildings over , Joseph Matherenne cried as he directed the faint light of his cell phone ’s screen over the bloody corpse of his 23 - year - old brother .
His body was draped over the rubble of the office where he worked as a video technician .
Unlike most of the bodies in the street , there was no blanket to cover his face .
Central Port - Au - Prince resembles a war zone .
Some buildings are standing , unharmed .
Those that were damaged tended to collapse completely , spilling into the street on top of cars and telephone poles .
In the day following the quake , there was no widespread violence .
Guns , knives and theft were n’t seen on the streets , lined only with family after family carrying their belongings .
They voiced their anger and frustration with sad songs that echoed throughout the night , not their fists .
If in New Orleans , the militarisation of the rescue effort fostered neo-liberal profiteering , in Haiti the stakes are much higher .
Peter Hallward argues :
Ever since the US invaded and occupied the country in 1915 , every serious political attempt to allow Haiti ’s people to move ( in former president Jean - Bertrand Aristide ’s phrase ) “ from absolute misery to a dignified poverty ” has been violently and deliberately blocked by the US government and some of its allies .
Aristide ’s own government ( elected by some 75 % of the electorate ) was the latest victim of such interference , when it was overthrown by an internationally sponsored coup in 2004 that killed several thousand people and left much of the population smouldering in resentment .
The UN has subsequently maintained a large and enormously expensive stabilisation and pacification force in the country .
[ snip ]
The international community has been effectively ruling Haiti since the 2004 coup .
The same countries scrambling to send emergency help to Haiti now , however , have during the last five years consistently voted against any extension of the UN mission ’s mandate beyond its immediate military purpose .
Proposals to divert some of this “ investment ” towards poverty reduction or agrarian development have been blocked , in keeping with the long - term patterns that continue to shape the ­distribution of international “ aid ” .
With so much suffering , it ’s tempting just to forget about politics .
But as has been said so often , this is not a natural disaster but the result of decades of poverty and exploitation .
We ’ve seen over and over again what a US occupation means for Haiti : more of business as usual .
And that means that the catastrophes will continue .
Mako is on the FSF 's Board of Directors .
Free software is not really about software in this fundamental sense ; it 's about bringing freedom to users through software .
In free software 's incredible success over the last two decades , many people have lost sight of this simple fact .
We have created an incredible array of applications , libraries , and tools .
We have created vibrant development and support communities .
We have created new development methodologies , powerful copyleft licenses , and massive collaborative projects .
But these are all how we give users freedom .
They are not freedom itself .
They are not what we were trying to achieve .
They are our instruments , not our goal .
This distinction becomes central in a world where technology is in flux .
Indeed , we live in such a world .
We can see signs of this in how , as most users ' primary computers become mobile phones and new types of network services make up most of many users ' interactions with computers , the free software movement 's old applications , communities , development methodologies , and licenses can become ill - suited to , or ineffective at , protecting user freedoms .
And indeed , in the next few years , bringing freedom to computer users will need to involve new software and new forms of advocacy .
It will need to involve new licenses and new techniques for their enforcement .
It will need to involve new forms of collaboration and organization .
If the free software movement is to succeed , it must stay focused on computer users ' freedom — on the question of why we do what we do — and then work creatively on how to best respect and protect the freedom we are working toward .
If we are overly focused on how we 've done things in the past , we may lose sight of the most fundamental goal of supporting users ' control over their technology in general .
There are many organizations that support the how of today 's free software in various ways — they are law firms and companies and nonprofit organizations supporting various free software projects .
The Free Software Foundation is , by far , the most important organization focused on why — on the underlying principle of software freedom .
As such , it plays an essential role in keeping our broader community focused on the key issues , threats , and challenges that will affect the success of every free software project , and every computer user , in the present and in the future .
In this period of rapid change in computer technology , its role is more vital than ever .
The consequence of any failure is more dire .
Here are some of the ways that I will be encouraging the FSF to serve the free software movement in the coming year :
Mobile Phones
In a short essay I wrote earlier this year , I pointed out that there are now billions of mobile phones and that , although these phones are increasingly powerful computers , they represent one of the most locked - down , proprietary , and “ unfree ” technologies in wide use .
The implications of this fact for users ' control over their technology are dire .
Although some widely used phones make extensive use of free software , most “ free ” phones are locked down and Tivoized and their users remain fettered , divided , and helpless .
We must raise awareness of free software issues among users of phones , communicate to users that phones are powerful general purpose computers , and explain that control over these devices has critical implications for individual autonomy in the future .
Toward this end , the FSF staff will launch an advocacy campaign around mobile phones and software freedom in the coming year .
Network Services
As network services — like those built by Facebook , Google , and others — have continued to grow both in scope and penetration over the last year , the importance of a meaningful free software responses grows as well .
The launch of products like Google 's network - centric ChromeOS offers one glimpse of what a future computing platform may look like .
The implications for user freedom , and for the effectiveness of traditional free software approaches , are frightening .
The fact that many network services are built using free software does not make the effect of these services on users ' autonomy and freedom any less catastrophic .
In the next year , the FSF is planning to release the first of what I hope will be several statements on software freedom and network services .
Building off the work of the FSF - supported group Autonomous , the Foundation will help provide guidelines for those implementing network services , for users deciding whether to use services , and for developers trying to build services that go further to respect their users ' freedom .
Reaching beyond our traditional communities
Successfully fighting for user freedom is going to mean successfully reaching out to users outside the FSF 's historical “ base ” .
The FSF continues to do so with its Defective By Design anti-DRM campaign and its End Software Patents work .
In the last year , the FSF has also reached out to younger users through its " GNU Generation " campaign run by and for high school students .
Additionally , the FSF convened a summit this year on women in free software .
The FSF plans to build on these successes in the coming year and to expand similar outreach projects .
Of course , fighting for and promoting software freedom is more work than today 's FSF has the resources to accomplish .
Each of my three points above represents an ambitious undertaking , and yet just a portion of the items on the plate of the FSF 's small but dedicated staff .
Even just continuing its existing projects will require that the FSF adds hundreds of new members by the end of this period .
Your membership and donations help make goals like this possible .
A strong free software movement focused on the principled issues of software freedom — and a strong FSF in particular — will determine what freedoms the next generation of computer users will enjoy .
At stake is no less than that next generation 's autonomy .
I know that this is not the first fundraising appeal you 've read this season and I know that the weakened economy makes giving difficult for many .
I understand that the cost of a membership or donation may be less easy to afford this year .
But we also cannot afford a weakened FSF at this important point of technological transition .
If you are not an FSF associate member , now is the time to become one .
If you 've read my appeal the last two years and decided to wait , now is the time to take the plunge .
Membership is $ 120 per year ( $ 60 for students ) and payable monthly .
If you are already a member , please join me in giving generously through a tax - deductible donation , or encourage a friend to sign up .
The FSF is a small , humble organization of passionate individuals working tirelessly for our software freedom .
I 've seen firsthand that even small gifts make a difference .
Simple and Intuitive
Coin provides a user with unified wallet address that can be used to manage all Crypto .
That means you can use the same address to participate in ICOs or airdrops as well as to send and receive Crypto .
Coin is intuitive and easy to understand yet packed with tons of useful features .
Microsoft has applied for a neat patent for a smart inductive charger ( via Being Manan ) .
Inductive charging , used , for example , in the Palm Pre's Touchstone , allows for contactless charging of devices in close proximity .
The charger couples inductive charging with an LCD screen that can be used to show off " weather conditions , sports scores , news headlines , and / or other selected items " through a wireless connection to a PC .
More useful , I would think , would be some indication of the charging status of the device .
Image from the patent application showing the basic design of the device
Apparent pictures of a prototype of the device have emerged .
Though we can't be certain that it uses the patented technology , the prototype is all but identical to the design shown in the patent , suggesting that development is quite far advanced .
The prototype is shown charging a wireless mouse .
This seems a rather mundane use for such a fancy charger , and the thing is rather smaller than might be expected — the mouse covers the LCD screen when it's on the charger , which renders it all a bit useless .
A larger device that could be used to charge a range of devices ( mouse , Windows Phone , some future Zune ) would seem a lot more compelling — a one - stop charging shop for all your wireless Microsoft gadgets .
A beautiful collection of images of Europe in ancient times and today
Ancient history is the study of the written past from the beginning of recorded human history in the Old World until the Early Middle Ages in Europe .
The span of recorded history altogether is roughly 5,000 years , with Cuneiform script emerging from the protoliterate period around the 30th century BC being the oldest form of writing discovered so far .
This is the beginning of history , as opposed to prehistory , according to the definition used by most historians .
The term classical antiquity is often used to refer to ancient history since the beginning of recorded Greek history in about 776 BC ( First Olympiad ) .
This coincides , roughly , with the traditional date of the founding of Rome in 753 BC , the beginning of the history of ancient Rome .
Although the ending date of ancient history is disputed , Western scholars use the fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476 , or the death of the emperor Justinian I , or the coming of Islam and the rise of Charlemagne [ 9 ] as the end of ancient European history .

INTERNATIONAL scientists nudged back the minute hand of the symbolic Doomsday Clock , as they praised US President Barack Obama for helping to pull the world back from nuclear or environmental catastrophe .
" It is six minutes to midnight , " the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists ( BAS ) , which created the Doomsday Clock in 1947 as a barometer of how close the world is to an apocalyptic end .
" For the first time since atomic bombs were dropped in 1945 , leaders of nuclear weapons states are co-operating to vastly reduce their arsenals and secure all nuclear bomb - making material , " the statement by the panel of international scientists , including 19 Nobel laureates , said .
" For the first time ever , industrialised and developing countries alike are pledging to limit climate - changing gas emissions that could render our planet nearly uninhabitable . "
A key player in the new , global era of co-operation was Mr Obama , whose election in 2008 ushered in " a change in the US government 's orientation toward international affairs " , said Professor Lawrence Krauss , co-chair of BAS 's board of sponsors , speaking at the ceremony to turn back the hands of the symbolic clock .
Mr Obama brought with him to the White House " a more pragmatic , problem - solving approach " than his predecessor , George W. Bush , the scientists said .
" Not only has Obama initiated new arms reduction talks with Russia , he has started negotiations with Iran to close its nuclear enrichment program , and directed the US Government to lead a global effort to secure loose fissile material in four years , " Prof Krauss said , reading from the BAS statement .
Since it was created by scientists who helped to develop the world 's first atomic weapons , the Doomsday clock has come to be seen as a measure of what progress , if any , the world has made in moving away from the risk of nuclear , climate - caused or bio -warfare catastrophe .
Midnight on the clock signifies the apocalypse , and the minute hand symbolises the countdown to disaster .
The last time the minute hand was moved was in 2007 , when Bush was president .
Then , the clock was bumped two minutes closer to midnight .
In resetting the clock this year , the scientists said they were encouraged by recent developments , but had chosen to put back the clock by only one minute to show they were " mindful that the clock is ticking " , said Prof Krauss .
" By shifting the hand back from midnight by only one additional minute , we emphasise how much needs to be accomplished " while at the same time recognising that global co-operation has moved forward , he said .
Putting back the clock by only one minute also meant that " there 's great potential for it to move again , in either direction " , said Prof Krauss .
Which way the hands of the clock are moved next time was up to scientists , world leaders and ordinary people , said Prof Krauss , urging them all to seize the " unique opportunity we have right now to begin to free ourselves from the terror of nuclear weapons and slow drastic changes to our shared global environment .
" We are now poised at a unique time , with hope and opportunity .
Let 's not blow it , " he said .
waf -
The flexible build system http://code.google.com/p/waf/
wafというものを最近知り一目惚れしてしまったので、紹介記事を書きます。ユーザーが増えると嬉しいな。
wafとは何か？特徴・利点・使うべき理由 waf はPythonベースのビルドシステムです。同様のことを行うツールとして、Autotools、Scons、CMake、Antなどがあります。Sconsからの派生で、比較的新しいソフトウェアです。 分かりやすい Pythonで書かれており、スクリプトもPythonで記述します。シェルスクリプトと謎のマクロが入り混じるAutotoolsや、独自言語のCMakeなどに比べて扱い易いです。Pythonを知っていれば非常にすんなりと使いこなすことが出来ます。Pythonを知らなくても、他の独自言語を覚えるよりは実りがあるかと思います。Pythonで記述しますので、自分で機能を拡張することも非常に簡単にできます。このあたりはAutotoolsに苦しめられた経験のある方なら最も有力な乗り換え理由になると思います。 配布しやすい Pythonで書かれているので、Pythonのインストールされているシステムでならどこでも動作します。幅広いバージョンのPythonで動作します。今やPythonはほとんどのLinuxにデフォルトでインストールされていますし、Windows、MacなどでもPythonが入っていれば動作させることができます。wafは80KB程度の単一のPythonスクリプトで、BSDライセンスなので、プロジェクトに含めて配布することが容易です。wafを同梱して配布することによりAutotoolsなどでは起こりがちなバージョン問題が起こりません（Autotoolsではconfigureで配布するとは思いますが）。configureスクリプトのラッパがあるので、これを用いると、Linux文化での標準的なソフトウェアのインストール方法である configure ; make ; make install にも簡単に対応することができます。 高速に動作する configure が 非常に高速に行われます。ccacheのようなオブジェクトキャッシュ、並列コンパイルの標準サポートにより、コンパイルも高速です。
多くの言語の組み込みサポート C、C++、D、Java、OCaml、などのプログラミング言語のコンパイル、依存解析、実行がサポートされています。新しい言語のサポートも比較的容易です。
出力が分かりやすい 出力がカラーで、失敗すると赤く表示されるので、コンパイル結果がわかりやすいです。また、コンパイルすべきファイルがいくつ有って、現在何個目のファイルをコンパイルしているかが表示されるので、コンパイルの進捗状況がわかりやすいです。コンパイルの進捗をプログレスバーで表示する機能もあって、見ていて楽しいです。
wafの機能 configure , build , install , uninstall
パッケージ作 成
ユニットテスト支 援
ディレクトリ監視による自動再コンパイル などが標準でサポートされています。一通り揃っていると思います。ビルドフェーズを追加することも容易です。
インストール waf をインストールするのは以下の理由から推奨されません。 adminが要る・めんど い
バージョン問 題
wafを同梱しない理由がない
Windowsにはインストールできない wafスクリプトをプロジェクトに含めてしまうのが一般的です。
http://code.google.com/p/waf/ wafのページから、最新版のwafをダウンロードして使います。 $ wget http://waf.googlecode.com/files/waf-1.5.11
$ mv waf - 1.5.11 waf $ chmod +x waf $ ./waf Waf :
Please run waf from a directory containing a file named " wscript " or run distclean wafを使う にはwscriptというファイルを書く必要があるので、今のところはエラーが出ます。wafは実行の際に自身をカレントディレクトリに展開するので、書き込み可能なディレクトリで実行しなければならないことに注意してください。 プロジェクト作成の度にwafをダウンロードしたくない、実行の際に./を付けるのが嫌など、些細な点が気になるならば、上記デメリットを理解した上でインストールすることも可能です。その際にはwafのページからたどれる、waf book の
http://freehackers.org/~tnagy/wafbook/ch01s03.html
のあたりが参考になると思います。 wafは単一スクリプトだけでなく、tar.bz2版も配布されています。これには、いろいろなサンプルプロジェクトや、Autotoolsからの移行ツールや、bash-completion、wafのソースなどが含まれていますので、wafを使っていこうという場合には一度確認されることをおすすめします。
wscriptの基本的な書き方 wafはwscriptというファイルに、ビルドに必要な情報を書きこみます。これは普通のPythonプログラムとして記述します。以下に雛形を示します。
APPNAME = ' test - project ' VERSION = ' 1.0.0 ' srcdir = '. ' blddir = ' build ' def set_options ( opt ) : pass def configure ( conf ) : pass def build ( bld ) : pass def shutdown ( ctx ) : pass まず、変数を四つ定義しま す
。APPNAMEとVERSIONはプログラムの名前とバージョンを指定します。srcdirとblddirはソースの場所と、コンパイル時の一時ファイルを置くディレクトリを指定します。これらの変数は省略すると、それぞれ'noname'、' 1.0'、'.'、' build 'が使われます。 このままでは実行しても何も起こらないので、次のように書いてみます。
APPNAME = ' test - project ' VERSION = ' 1.0.0 ' srcdir = '. ' blddir = ' build ' def set_options ( opt ) : print " set_options " def configure ( conf ) : print " configure " def build ( bld ) : print " build " def shutdown ( ctx ) : print " shutdown " $ ./waf configure set_options configure ' configure ' finished successfully ( 0.002s ) shutdown $ ./waf build set_options Waf : Entering directory `/home / hideyuki / project / waf_test / build ' build Waf : Leaving directory ` /home / hideyuki / project / waf_test / build ' ' build ' finished successfully ( 0.003s ) shutdown configure 、build 実行時に、それぞれ対応する関数が呼ばれているのが分かります。ここにそれぞれ必要なことを書いていくことになります。
C/C++プログラムのコンパイル C++プログラムをコンパイルする例を示します。 def set_options ( opt ) : opt.tool_options ( ' compiler_cxx ' ) def configure ( conf ) : conf.check_tool ( ' compiler_cxx ' ) def build ( bld ) : bld ( features = ' cxx cprogram ' , source = ' main.cpp ' , target = ' main ' ) まず、set_optionsで、C++コンパイラ用のオプションを使えるようにします。'compiler_cxx'はC++コンパイラ用の設定です。Cコンパイラを使うなら、'compiler_cc'を指定します。次に、configureでC++コンパイラのチェックをします。最後にbuildにビルドルールを書きます。featuresには、プログラムをどうやってコンパイルするかを書きます。ここでは、cxxとcprogramを指定しています。これは、空白区切で指定してもいいですし、['cxx ' , ' cprogram ' ]
のように文字列のリストを渡してもいいです。これは以降出てくる文字列を複数している所でもすべて共通の仕様です。cxxは、C++のコンパイラでコンパイルせよと言う指定、cprogramは実行ファイルを作れと言う指定です。他にcshlib、cstaticlibなどがあります。sourceにはソースファイルを指定します。targetには生成する実行ファイルの名前を指定します。
ビルドを実行すると次のようになります。 $ cat main.cpp # include < iostream > using namespace std ; int main ( ) { cout < < " Hello , waf waf world ! " << endl ; return 0 ; } $ ./waf configure Checking for program g++, c++ : ok /usr / bin/g++
Checking for program cpp : ok /usr / bin / cpp
Checking for program ar : ok /usr / bin / ar Checking for program ranlib : ok /usr / bin / ranlib Checking for g++ : ok ' configure ' finished successfully ( 0.049s ) $ ./waf build Waf : Entering directory `/home / hideyuki / project / waf_test / build ' [ 1/2 ] cxx : main.cpp -> build / default/main_1.o [ 2/2 ] cxx_link : build / default / main_1.o -> build / default / main Waf : Leaving directory ` /home / hideyuki / project / waf_test / build ' ' build ' finished successfully ( 0.348s ) $ build / default / main Hello , waf waf world !
configureで、C++コンパイラの存在がチェックされ、buildでmain.cppがコンパイルされ、build/default/mainに実行ファイルがリンクされます。ビルドの際に生成されるものはすべてbuild(blddirで指定したディレクトリ)以下に置かれます。 なお、waf buildのときのbuildは省略できるので、単にwafと実行すればbuildできます。
ファイル複数からなるプログラムはsourceに複数ファイルを指定すればできます。 def build ( bld ) : bld ( features = ' cxx cprogram ' , source = ' main.cpp foo.cpp ' , target = ' main ' , includes = '.' ) includesにヘッダファイルのあるディレクトリを指定します。これを書けば、そこに含まれるヘッダの依存関係を自動で解析してくれます。
$ cat main.cpp # include < iostream > using namespace std ; #include " foo.h " int main ( ) { cout < < foo ( 123 ) < < endl ; return 0 ; } $ cat foo.cpp #include " foo.h " int foo( int n ) { return n*n ; } $ cat foo.h int foo( int n ) ; $ ./waf configure Checking for program g++, c++ : ok /usr / bin/g++

必要なファイルだけ再コンパイルされているのが分かります。なお、ファイルの再コンパイルはmd5の比較により行われるので、内容が本当に変更されていないと再コンパイルは行われません。
ライブラリの作り 方 ライブラリを作る場合は、featuresにcprogramの代わりにcshlibまたはcstaticlibと書くだけです。先程の例を、foo.cppをライブラリに、main.cppをそれを使うプログラムに変更してみます。 def build ( bld ) : bld ( features = ' cxx cstaticlib ' , source = ' foo.cpp ' , target = ' foo ' , includes = '.' ) bld ( features = ' cxx cprogram ' , source = ' main.cpp ' , target = ' main ' , includes = '.' , uselib_local = ' foo ' ) featuresにcstaticlibを指定しました。foo.cppからfooという静的ライブラリを作れという指示です。mainは今度はそのfooというライブラリをリンクしなければなりません。その指定をuselib_localというところに書きます。同じプロジェクトで作られるライブラリ（ローカルなライブラリ）への参照はuselib_localに書きます。

サブディレクトリ 先程の例を、libfooをfooというディレクトリに移動させようと思います。サブモジュールを分割するのはプロジェクトをシンプルに保つために重要です。libfooを作る方法は独立していた方が良いので、wscriptも分割します。ディレクトリ構成としては次のようになります。 |- foo | |- foo.cpp | |- foo.h | `- wscript |- main.cpp `- wscript ルートのwscriptから子のwscriptを呼び出すには次のようにします。 ef set_options ( opt ) : opt.tool_options ( ' compiler_cxx ' ) def configure ( conf ) : conf.check_tool ( ' compiler_cxx ' ) def build ( bld ) : bld ( features = ' cxx cprogram ' , source = ' main.cpp ' , target = ' main ' , includes = '. foo ' , uselib_local = ' foo ' ) bld.recurse ( ' foo ' ) def build ( bld ) : bld ( features = ' cxx cshlib ' , source = ' foo.cpp ' , target = ' foo ' , includes = '.' ) bld.recurse(' foo ' ) と書いてある部分がfoo/wscriptを呼び出す部分です。こうすると、foo/wscriptにある同じ関数が呼ばれます。この場合だとbuildなのでbuildが呼ばれます。もちろんconfigureからrecurseすることも可能です。recurseにはディレクトリのリストを渡せます。サブディレクトリのwscriptには、呼び出されない関数は書かなくても構いません。configureをrecurseできるので、各サブモジュールに必要なライブラリチェックを分散させることができます。Autotoolsのようにconfigure.acが肥大化したり、チェックの場所と使用の場所が離れたりすることが防げます。実行すると次のようになります。

ライブラリ、ヘッダファイルのチェック C/C++のライブラリ、ヘッダファイルのチェックはcheck_ccまたは、check_cxxによって行うことができます。これらはconfigure時に行うので、configure()
に記述します。一通りの例を以下に示します。 def configure ( conf ) : conf.check_tool ( ' compiler_cxx ' ) conf.check_cxx( lib = ' m ' ) conf.check_cxx(lib = ' superlib ' , libpath = '/var/super/lib ' ) conf.check_cxx(header_name = ' time.h' ) conf.check_cxx(function_name = ' printf ' , header_name = ' stdio.h ' , mandatory = True ) if conf.check_cxx ( lib = ' nuboo ' ) : print " nuboo exists ! " else : print " nuboo does not exist ! " conf.check_cxx( fragment = 'int main ( ) { return 0 ; } ' , define_name = ' boobah ' ) conf.check_cxx( fragment = " " " # include < iostream > using namespace std ; int main ( ) { cout < < sizeof ( long ) < < endl ; return 0 ; } " " " , define_name = ' LONG_SIZE ' , execute = True , define_ret =
True , msg = ' Checking for long size ' ) conf.check_cxx( lib = 'm ' , cxxflags = '- Wall ' , defines = [ ' var=foo ' , 'x=y ' ] , uselib_store = ' M ' ) conf.write_config_header ( ' config.h ' ) conf.env.store ( ' conf.log ' ) check_cxxはC++コンパイラを用いてコンパイルを試みます。同様にcheck_ccはCコンパイラを用いてコンパイルを試みます。それぞれ、使用するためには、set_optionsでopt.tool_options('compiler_cxx')、opt.tool_options(' compiler_cc')
されている必要があります。
libにライブラリ名を指定すると、そのライブラリがリンクできるかどうかを調べます。その際にlibpathでライブラリを探す場所を指定できます。
header_nameにヘッダファイル名を指定すると、そのファイルをインクルードできるか調べます。function_nameに関数名を指定すると、関数の存在を調べられます。このときライブラリ、ヘッダファイルがそれぞれ存在するとconf.env.HAVE_TIME_H、conf.env.HAVE_PRINTFなどが1に設定されます。
madantoryを指定すると、そのチェックを必須にできます。これを指定したチェックが失敗するとconfigureがこけます。 check_cxxはboolを返すので、Pythonのif文などで簡単に利用できます。とても便利です。
コード片のコードテストや、コード片の出力をconf.envに設定できます。上の例ですと、LONG_SIZEに" 8" が設定されます。 waf にはuselibという仕組みがあります。詳しくは後述のライブラリの参照で述べますが、ここでは、ここに指定した文字列を接尾辞に、いろいろな変数が定義されます。ここでは、LIB_M、CXXDEFINES_M、CXXFLAGS_M、が定義されます。 write_config_header ()
を呼び出すと、集めた情報をC/C++のヘッダファイルに書きだします。例えば、上のコードなら、次のコードが生成されます。
#ifndef _CONFIG_H_WAF
# define _CONFIG_H_WAF
#define HAVE_TIME_H 1 #define HAVE_PRINTF
1 #define boobah 1 #define LONG_SIZE " 8 " #endif conf.env.store ( ) を呼び出すと、環境を書きだすことができます。これはwafコードのデバッグにとても便利です。 configureの実行結果を以下に載せておきます。
$ ./waf configure Checking for program g++, c++ : ok /usr / bin/g++

pkg-config pkg-config、あるいは、hoge - configのような、Cのコンパイラフラグ、リンクフラグ、ライブラリパスなどを取得するためのプログラムを提供しているライブラリがあります。このようなライブラリがあるばあい、とても便利にチェックを行うことができます。 def configure ( conf ) : conf.check_cfg(atleast_pkgconfig_version = ' 0.0.0 ' ) conf.check_cfg ( package = ' pango ' , atleast_version = ' 0.0.0 ' ) conf.check_cfg ( package = ' pango ' , exact_version = ' 0.21 ' ) conf.check_cfg ( package = ' pango ' , max_version = ' 9.0.0 ' ) conf.check_cfg ( package = ' pango ' , args= '-- cflags -- libs ' ) pango_version = conf.check_cfg ( modversion = ' pango ' ) conf.check_cfg ( path = ' sdl - config ' , args = '-- cflags -- libs ' , package = '' , uselib_store= ' SDL ' ) pkg-configの場合、check_cfgで、packageにパッケージ名を渡せば、バージョンのチェックなどができます。独自のconfigプログラムの場合は、pathに指定してやります（この場合はバージョンチェックなどはできない模様）。ここで、uselib_storeを指定して、argsにコンパイラフラグを取得するための引数を書いてやると、check_cfgはその返り値を解析して、-IxxxならCPPPATH_hogeに、-DxxxならCXXDEFINES_hogeに、-LxxxならLIBPATH_hogeに、-lxxxならLIB_hogeに、その他はCXXFLAGS_hogeなどに、自動的に振り分けて追加されます。
ライブラリの参照 bldの引数で、ライブラリの参照を追加できます。例えば、pthreadをリンクするなら、次のようになります。 def build ( bld ) : bld ( features = ' cxx cprogram ' , source = ' main.cpp ' , target = ' main ' , includes = '.' , lib = [ ' pthread ' ] ) ライブラリパスを指定したいなら、libpathを書きます。 def build ( bld ) : bld ( features = ' cxx cprogram ' , source = ' main.cpp ' , target = ' main ' , includes = '.' , lib = [ ' pthread ' ] , libpath = [ ' /usr/local / lib ' ] )
その他、いろいろオプションを指定できます。 def build ( bld ) : bld ( features = ' cxx cprogram ' , source = ' main.cpp ' , target = ' main ' , includes = '.' , defines = [ ' LINUX=1 ' , ' BIDULE ' ] , cxxflags = [ ' - O2 ' , '- Wall ' ] , lib = [ ' m ' ] , libpath = [ ' / usr / lib ' ] , linkflags = [ ' - g ' ] )
uselib uselibを用いると、上記のいろいろなコンパイルの設定を一気に設定できます。 def build ( bld ) : bld ( features = ' cxx cprogram ' , source = ' main.cpp ' , target = ' main ' , includes = '.' , uselib = ' SDL ' ) bldの引数にuselibを指定してやると、その文字列を接尾辞とする設定がまとめてなされます。例えば、LIB_SDLがlibに、LIBPATH_SDLがlibpathに、CXXFLAGS_SDLがcxxflagsに設定されます。check_cfgもしくはcheck_cxxでのuselib_storeとuselibを組み合わせて使うと、コンパイル・リンクフラグの設定を大変簡単に行うことができます。
オプション configure時のオプションを自由に追加することができます。プロジェクトの特定のモジュールの有効・無効を切り替えたりなどが典型的な利用例です。set_options() でadd_optionすることによりオプションの追加ができます。 def set_options ( opt ) : opt.tool_options ( ' compiler_cxx ' ) opt.add_option ( '-- enable - super - module ' , action = ' store_true ' , default = False , help = ' enable a super module ' ) opt.add_option ( '- - build_kind ' , action = ' store ' , default = ' debug , release ' , help = ' build the selected variants ' ) def build ( bld ) : import Options if Options.options.enable_super_module : build.recurse( ' super ' ) 追加したオプションは waf -- help にも表示されます。 $ ./ waf -- help waf [ command ] [ options ]
Main commands ( example : ./waf build - j4 ) build : builds the project clean : removes the build files configure : configures the project dist : makes a tarball for redistributing the sources distcheck : checks if the sources compile ( tarball from ' dist ' ) distclean : removes the build directory install : installs the build files uninstall : removes the installed files Options : -- version show program 's version number and exit -h , -- help show this help message and exit -j JOBS , -- jobs=JOBS amount of parallel jobs ( 1 ) -k , -- keep keep running happily on independent task groups -v , -- verbose verbosity level - v - vv or - vvv [ default : 0 ] -- nocache ignore the WAFCACHE ( if set ) -- zones=ZONES debugging zones ( task_gen , deps , tasks , etc ) -p , -- progress - p : progress bar ; - pp : ide output -- targets =COMPILE_TARGETS
build given task generators , e.g. " target1 , target2 " -- enable - super - module enable a super module -- build - kind =BUILD_KIND build the selected variants ...
ユニットテスト waf はユニットテスト支援機能があります。先のプロジェクトで、libfooのユニットテストを作成することにします。 def set_options ( opt ) : opt.tool_options ( ' compiler_cxx ' ) opt.tool_options ( ' UnitTest ' ) def configure ( conf ) : conf.check_tool ( ' compiler_cxx ' ) conf.check_cxx( lib = ' gtest_main ' , uselib_store = ' gtest ' ) def build ( bld ) : bld ( features = ' cxx cprogram test ' , source = ' foo_test.cpp ' , target = ' foo_test ' , includes = '. foo ' , uselib_local = ' foo ' , uselib = ' gtest ' ) bld.recurse ( ' foo ' ) import UnitTest bld.add_post_fun(UnitTest.summary ) まず、set_optionsでtool_optionsにUnitTestを追加します。次に、テストプログラムを作ります。これはfeaturesにtestを追加するだけです。testフィーチャーがついているプログラムは、コンパイル後に自動で実行され、その結果が集計されるようになります。それから、bld.add_post_funでUnitTest.summaryが最後に実行されるようにします。これでテストの結果が表示されるようになります。
#include < gtest/gtest.h > # include " foo.h " TEST ( footest , test ) { EXPECT_EQ ( foo ( 123 ) , 123 + 123 ) ; } テストプログラムを書きます。今回はgtestを使いました。fooは二乗を返す関数だったので、これはfailするはずです。実行してみます。

relative_trickを指定すると、ディレクトリ構造を保持してインストールされます。上の例なら、${PREFIX}/include/foo/foo.h にインストールされます（一つ目の例は${PREFIX}/foo.h になります）。 その他、別名でのインストールや、シンボリックリンク作成もできます。
パッケージ作成 さて、libfooも おおよそ完成したので、パッケージを作って配布しましょう。wafでは、Autotoolsと同様、waf distとすると、tarballが作成されます。 $ ./waf dist
New archive created : test - project -1.0.0.tar.bz2 ( sha= '0af6ce61eb3661bfc54efa5d2b301442a7e84557 ' ) ' dist ' finished successfully ( 0.033s ) $ ls build foo_test.cpp main.cpp test- project -1.0.0.tar.bz2 wscript foo foo_test.cpp~ main.cpp~ waf wscript~ $ tar - jtf test - project - 1.0.0.tar.bz2 test-project -1.0.0 / test - project - 1.0.0 / waf test- project -1.0.0/main.cpp test-project -1.0.0/ foo/ test-project-1.0.0/foo/foo.cpp test-project-1.0.0/foo/wscript test-project -1.0.0/foo/foo.h test- project -1.0.0/wscript test-project-1.0.0/foo_test.cpp test-project-1.0.0.tar.bz2というファイルが出来ています。デフォルトでは、bz2圧縮されます。圧縮方式を変更するには次のようにします。 import Scripting Scripting.g_gz = ' gz ' ところで、tarballに 含めるファイルを指定した覚えはありませんでした。どうやってwafはtarballに含めるべきファイルを判断しているのでしょうか？ wafは基本的に、ディレクトリの内容をすべてtarballに含めます。そこから、特定の接尾辞を持つファイル・ディレクトリと、特定の名前のファイル・ディレクトリを除外します。ソースコードによると、、デフォルトの除外接尾辞は'~ .rej .orig .pyc .pyo .bak .tar.bz2 tar.gz .zip .swp'、デフォルトの除外ファイル・ディレクトリは'.bzr .bzrignore .git .gitignore .svn CVS .cvsignore .arch-ids {arch} SCCS BitKeeper .hg _MTN _darcs Makefile Makefile.in config.log'のようです。さらに、blddirは除外されます。 dist_hook ( ) という関数を作れば、distで含めるファイルをカスタマイズすることができます。dist_hook()は、tarballに含めるファイルをテンポラリディレクトリにまとめて、圧縮する直前に、そこのディレクトリがカレントディレクトリになった状態で呼ばれます。 たとえば、main.cppを含めたくなければこうします。 def dist_hook ( ) : import os os.remove ( ' main.cpp ' ) $ ./waf dist

As I have talked about here before , I ’m keenly watching the Republican contenders for MI - 07 .
One of the top two candidates likely to win the Republican primary already held the seat for one - term : Tim Walberg .
This week he released a statement that said this :
One Year after the Stimulus Package : Higher Unemployment in U.S. , Taxpayer Dollars Creating Jobs Overseas
The email Subject line was even more bold :
Stimulus Results in Higher Unemployment & Jobs Overseas
See what he did there ?
He ’s now making the connection that the Recovery Act CAUSED unemployment .
Brilliant and unrelenting hypocrisy .
Here ’s the rest of the press release where he essentially blames Democrat for the 7th District Mark Schauer for failing to stop waste :
One year ago today President Obama signed the $ 787 billion stimulus package into law .
Since signing the legislation , the national unemployment rate has climbed from 7.6 % to 9.7 % and the cost of the stimulus package has increased by $ 75 billion .
Congressman Mark Schauer , who voted for the stimulus bill , told his constituents that there was no pork or earmarks in the stimulus bill .
Congressman Schauer pledged “ vigorous oversight ” to ensure the stimulus was “ administered efficiently and effectively . ”
Michigan ’s unemployment rate has increased from 12 % to 14.6 % , while billions of stimulus dollars created thousands of jobs overseas .
Though Congressman Schauer pledged “ vigorous oversight ” , here are a few examples of how stimulus dollars were wasted : $ 2 billion in energy spending created 6,000 jobs overseas .
“ researchers at Penn State University received $ 1.57 million to search for fossils in Argentina ”
“ $ 100,000 for socially conscious puppet shows . ”
$ 1 million to put up signs in Ohio advertising the use of stimulus funds .
“ The National Institutes of Health got $ 219,000 in funds to study whether female college students are more likely to ‘ hook up ’ after drinking alcohol . ”
“ Two million dollars in stimulus money went to build a replica railroad as a tourist attraction in Carson City , Nev . ”
“ Half a million dollars went to Arizona State University to study the genetic makeup of ants to determine distinctive roles in ant colonies ”
“ $ 450,000 went to the University of Arizona to study the division of labor in ant colonies . ”
“ The State University of New York at Buffalo won $ 390,000 to study young adults who drink malt liquor and smoke marijuana . ”
“ $ 5 million grant from the Department of Energy to create a geothermal energy system for the Oak Ridge City Center shopping mall … the mall has been losing tenants for years and is mostly empty . ”
“ Less government spending , lower taxes , and free - market health care reforms will empower individuals and small businesses , grow our economy , and spur job creation .
Unfortunately , Mark Schauer and his liberal Washington allies wasted taxpayer dollars , spent billions to create jobs overseas and voted for trillion dollar deficits , ” said Tim Walberg .
“ America is great and prosperous when government is limited and citizens are free to use their God - given talents to care for their family and help their community , ” Walberg added .
Drawing a causal connection between the Recovery Act which has by any measure kept our country from completely sinking into the abyss and which has without question prevented even larger unemployment numbers is the epitome of chutzpah , particularly since many of his brethren that did n’t actually lose their seats in 2008 like Walberg did are running around the countryside taking credit for the influx of funds and the creation of jobs that they themselves voted AGAINST .
And make no mistake , Walberg would have voted against the Recovery Act just like all his Republican friends did .
( Note , I will continue to use “ Recovery Act ” rather than “ Stimulus ” because it ’s important for us to connect the successes of the Recovery Act with the actual legislation which was called the Recovery Act . )
The claims of waste are another level of deceit .
If you add up all the numbers , including the biggest one of $ 2 billion for wind energy that has reportedly created less than 100 jobs in the U.S. vs. 6,000 overseas , you get a grand total of $ 2,011,229,000 .
This represents a whopping 0.23 % of the total Recovery Act spending .
If their criticism of the Recovery Act spending is that it created less than one - quarter of one percent in waste , I will gladly help them in their attempt to publicize it because that ’s a damn good record for any investment .
Even if you take out the one - third of the Recovery Act that is tax cuts — something that should give a guy like Tim Walberg a giant “ swell ” — you are still only talking about 0.35 % , about one - third of one percent .
The $ 2 billion in spending that it going to overseas companies to make wind turbines creating jobs outside of the U.S. is egregious .
Senator Chuck Schumer has even railed about it .
Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. , called the flow of money to foreign companies an outrage , because the stimulus , he said , was intended to create jobs inside the United States .
“ This is one of those stories in Washington that when you tell people five miles outside the Beltway , or anywhere else in America , they cannot believe it , ” Schumer told ABC News , “ It makes people lose faith in government , and it frankly infuriates me . ”
However , when you look at the core reason behind this issue , what you find is that there simply is not enough production of wind turbines in the U.S. to meet the demand created by the Recovery Act .
If Tim Walberg and his associates had not repeatedly failed invest in sustainable energy sources and had taken steps to nurture a wind energy sector in the U.S. , that might not be the case .
Instead , Walberg chanted “ Drill Here , Drill Now ” while holding publicity stunts like pumping gas at Michigan gas stations to get attention .
Jackson drivers headed to the pump today might get some help filling their tanks from a high - profile politician .
U.S. Rep . Tim Walberg was planning to take on the role of a gas station attendant and fuel up constituents ’ vehicles at the Citgo gas station at 1502 Cooper St. Walberg was n’t picking up the tab , so gas customers were still going to have to pay , but they could voice frustrations about the high prices to the first - term congressman / temporary attendant .
Walberg planned to ask drivers to jot down stories about their struggles with climbing energy costs and collect their receipts in 5 - gallon gas cans that he will take to Washington .
This is the GOP ’s answer to our energy problems and reliance on foreign oil , despite the fact that it would have no discernible impact on our oil supply :

So , in essence , Republicans starved a nascent industry so that it could barely get off the ground in this country while they held power .
And now that wind energy is in vogue , they are criticizing Democrats for having to buy foreign - made parts .
Unrelenting GOPocrisy .
Oh , and if you take that $ 2 billion out of the waste calculations , they can only point to 0.0013 % in waste .
And where I ’m from , that ’s what they call very weak tea .
I ’m just sayin ’ …

So this is what it has come to , Vonn thought to herself .
After several days of weather postponements , after a week of speculation about an injured right shin , after a year ’s buildup to her quest for a medal , it would come down to one bold charge after an old familiar foe .

“ One all - out run , ” Vonn would later say , “ with nothing left behind . ”
In one of the most stirring descents in Olympic downhill skiing history , Vonn ignored the pain in her injured shin , chased down Mancuso and caught up to nearly a lifetime of expectations to become the first American woman to win an Olympic downhill gold medal .
With an aggressive style and stance she held throughout her run  jaw , hands , knees and hips always angling forward for more speed 
Vonn ’s time of 1 minute 44.19 seconds on the bumpy , treacherous Whistler race course was 0.56 of a second ahead of Mancuso .
Elisabeth Görgl of Austria won the bronze medal .
“ It was a fight all the way down but I told myself to keep pushing regardless of the consequences , ” said Vonn , who remains a favorite to win additional gold medals .
“ I had to go for it every second . ”
While Mancuso ’s thrilling run seemed smooth , elegant and efficient , Vonn ’s seemed tinged with elements of force and desperation .
The bruised shin sustained more than two weeks ago was painful , she said , but pain - killers and adrenaline masked the debilitating effects .
From the start , Vonn built her lead over Mancuso , increasing it at nearly every timed interval down the race course .
Still , she had one nearly disastrous bobble about two - thirds of the way down at the sharp right turn known as Frog Bank , and then , she almost lost it all 10 seconds from the end .

Should be a good time for everyone who 's not Tower Knight or Flamelurker in my new game plus .
Two recent incidents have called various aspects of N.H.L. officiating into question .
The Alex Burrows - Stephane Auger flap , in which the Canucks player accused referee Auger of a personal vendetta against him , has captured the the hockey media ’s interest .
It ’s sensational , involving a colorful hard - working player who is suddenly scoring loads of goals playing with two talented linemates — the Sedin brothers .
Burrows chose to go public with his gripe .
Headlines guaranteed .
The N.H.L. fined Burrows $ 2,500 , said there was no evidence to discipline Auger and declared the case closed .
But , at least equally important is the matter we discussed yesterday :
A video replay showing evidence of goal being scored by the Flyers against the Penguins was not provided quickly enough by FSN Pittsburgh to officials reviewing that play .
Because FSN Pittsburgh is the Penguins television rights - holder , it called into question the integrity of the video review system .
Again , here ’s the clip …
Because the producer of the telecast , Lowell MacDonald , Jr. , eventually showed the clip , it led us to believe that its embargo was accidental .
FSN Pittsburgh took a different view , decided MacDonald ’s conduct was unacceptable and suspended him indefinitely .
In a statement released Tuesday ( quoted by The Pittsburgh Tribune - Review ) FSN said : “ There is nothing more important than the integrity of the game .
During last Thursday ’s game against the Philadelphia Flyers , a definitive replay of a Flyers goal was not aired prior to the conclusion of the official review and , as a result , a Flyers goal was not awarded .
Fortunately , this did not change the outcome of the game .
Nonetheless , FSN Pittsburgh ’s failure to provide video to the league officials in a timely fashion was wholly unacceptable .
FSN Pittsburgh has addressed this matter and has taken steps to ensure that such a failure does not occur again . ”
The Penguins also released a statement supporting the suspension and added , “ The integrity of the game is paramount . ”
The no -goal call , based on evidence that was inconclusive , was not game - altering ( although it did deprive Simon Gagne of his 500th career point ) , but the significance of compromising the replay system ca n’t be underestimated .
Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren told Chuck Gormley of the Camden Courier - Post that he planned to raise the issue at the next general managers ’ meeting in March .
“ Holmgren said the system is flawed if local television crews can dictate what is made available to the war room in Toronto and , more importantly , what is not , ” Gormley wrote and quoted Holmgren saying , “ You ca n’t have that happen in a game , no matter what the score is .
The points we ’re playing for are too valuable . ”
This is the first time in the 18 years of N.H.L. video review that a producer has been disciplined for withholding video from the review system .
It ’s a system has not been free of controversy ( most notably when crease violations were added to the list of reviewable plays in 1996 ) .
But it has been overwhelmingly successful in determining goal / no goal decisions .
Game after game , it operates seamlessly between the officials on the ice and Hockey Operations staff overseeing events in Toronto .
Still , as we wrote yesterday , the potential for conflict has always existed because local producers are either employees of their club or the club ’s television rights - holder .
The crew often travels with the club , sharing charter flights and bus rides .
They are nearly part of the team .
It would be naive to think that this sort of thing has not gone undetected previously .
If the N.H.L. determines this incident needs to be addressed league - wide , what options are available ?
The threat of fines may not be a solution .
The league has no authority to fine a local television outlet , although the club could be fined if its rights - holder was not fully cooperative with the video review officials .
It ’s easy to imagine 30 owners grumbling upon hearing that proposal .
The league could place an off - ice official in the television control room or truck , insuring that no chicanery takes place .
There are currently 15 off - ice officials at each game : an official scorer , a timekeeper , a penalty timekeeper , six real - time scoring statisticians , two goal judges , one video goal judge , two penalty box attendants and a television commercial coordinator .
If adding a 16th does n’t break the budget ( cue more owner grumbling ) , it risks a frigid response from production crews who may not welcome the intrusion .
There is an easier solution :
Make it mandatory to show every replay the producer has , regardless of whether it is a good view of the play or not .
Currently , a producer asks his replay technician if he ’s got a good shot of that play , and the producer watches that replay on a small monitor .
He makes a quick judgment of its worth .
If he thinks it ’s not a revealing replay , it may never be seen .
Showing all the available replay angles on the telecast and thus furnishing them to the video review system takes the onus off the producer and gives the league what it needs .
The replay official would need to know ahead of time how many replay machines each control room or truck has that night and he ’ll expect that number of angles will be shown on the telecast .
It ’s probably not fool - proof but it ’s better than what exists now .

" Rob explores the difference between a natural , organic , bottom - up connection consciousness and our corporately imposed top - down hierarchical collective consciousness .
What Rob is speaking about is the difference between an artificial and ultimately stagnate way of organizing the world and a natural , organic growth , which starts with a seed , sends downs roots and sends up shoots which blossom .
By returning to a Nature - based theory of connection , the Bottom - Up revolution brings us back into alignment with Earths laws , returning humanity to its place in creation .
Like a good gardener , Rob works into the soil of his thesis different voices that exemplify how this Bottom - Up revolution is expanding in politics , business , religion , personal self - awareness and story .
And he places technology where it belongs as a tool to further our connection consciousness , not an end in itself .
The bottom - up revolution is about democracy finally living up to its original ideals , where we the people decide what we need from our society . "

By Jonathan McIntosh
I usually try to stay away from the forces of darkness , but last week I killed a famous vampire – and let me tell you , it was fun !
Actually , I did n’t stake him myself —
I used new media tools to allow one of the strongest female television characters of our generation to do it .
OK , let me back up a minute .
Last week , at the Open Video Conference at NYU Law School , I debuted my feminist mash - up video , Buffy v. Edward .
It ’s an example of transformative storytelling which reinterprets the movie Twilight by re-cutting and combining it with the TV series Buffy : The Vampire Slayer .
Five months in the making , Buffy v. Edward is essentially an answer to the question “ What Would Buffy Do ? ”
My re-imagined story was specifically constructed as a response to Edward , and what his behavior represents in our larger social context for both men and women .
More than just a showdown between The Slayer and the Sparkly Vampire , it ’s also a humorous visualization of the metaphorical battle between two opposing visions of gender roles in the 21st century .
The response online has been swift , enthusiastic and overwhelming .
Apparently I touched a nerve .
Seems a lot of people thought it was about time the Slayer did something about Edward Cullen from the Twilight series ( who , in case you are not familiar , is a vampire that glitters like diamonds in the sunlight to attract prey — sorta like a stalk -y My Little Pony with fangs ) .
In the 11 days since I posted the remix online it has been viewed more than 950,000 times ( and growing by the day ) , and has been translated by volunteers into 16 languages , including Slovenian , Tagalog and Bahasa Indonesian via the website dotSUB.com .
On the whole , the reaction to the video has been tremendously positive — even in such outlets as Perez Hilton ’s blog and Entertainment Weekly ’s Pop Watch .
Jezebel.com , a popular blog on celebrity , sex and fashion for women , headlined their post : “ Buffy Shuts Down Edward Cullen In The Best Clip Ever . ”
And just yesterday , the top of the front page of the Los Angeles Times ’ online entertainment section links to their TV blog ’s post about the mashup ( they interviewed me and sought responses from viewers ) .
With that kind of prominent placement , I would n’t be surprised if more than a million people see the video by the end of the week ( maybe even by tomorrow ) .
The remix has been posted on hundreds of websites and blogs , and is still circulating through Facebook , YouTube and Twitter .
It has sparked a wide - ranging and timely online conversation about how obsessive and predatory male behavior passes for romance in too much of our pop culture .
Some of my favorite debates about the mashup have appeared on Smartbitchestrashybooks.com , Pixiepalace.com , and there are also long discussions on many Twilight fan blogs , such as Hisgoldeneye.com .
I 've been pleasantly surprised to find that the exchange on YouTube – where I often dread reading obnoxious comments on videos about gender – has also been exciting and constructive .
Statements such as the following , from commenter LillSenorita , have been common :
" Yes !
That is a hundred times more likely reaction from any girl !
Seen from this view , it really takes the " SPARKLING * ROMANTIC *AWW " from stalking . "
Perhaps most exciting is that young girls , who have so few positive role models in media , are finding that the mashup speaks to them , too .
Twilight fan Dawi Zarni , age 10 , told me :
" It 's really good , I liked the girl power it showed .
I 've watched it like 10 times and showed it to my friends .
It 's the best thing I have ever seen on the internet ! "
Since publishing the video , everyone from fellow YouTubers to Los Angeles Times reporters have been asking me why I decided to created this remix .
It all started six months ago when my partner and I watched the enormously popular movie Twilight , based on the book of the same name by Stephenie Meyer .
Coincidentally , we had recently finished re-watching the final season of Buffy : The Vampire Slayer , our favorite television show ever .
As huge Buffy fans we could n't help but compare the two stories .
We were troubled by how the main characters in Twilight seemed to embody antiquated , sexist gender stereotypes .
Teenage protagonist Bella Swan is written as passive , co-dependant and perpetually the damsel in distress .
Edward Cullen , her love interest , is written as over - protective , domineering and possessive .
Over the course of the film Edward is in turns patronizing , condescending and just downright creepy .
He spies on Bella , he stalks her ( for “ her own good ” ) , he sneaks into her room to watch her sleep ( without her consent ) and even confesses to a deep , overpowering desire to kill her .
We marveled at how the film attempted to present this behavior as sweet and deeply romantic – and how the larger pop culture discussion continued that framing for millions of young Twilight fans .
At several points during the film we found ourselves asking each other : “ What Would Buffy Do ? ”
Each answer we came up with conjured increasingly hilarious and satisfying mental pictures of a very different narrative .
Imagine if Edward Cullen met The Slayer at Sunnydale High : what kind of story would unfold if their responses were consistent with their personas , and with the value systems of the movie and TV show they represent ?
( Even as I type this I can imagine Buffy rolling her eyes at my idea of transplanting Edward into her universe , scolding me with this line from episode 96 : “ Please do n’t be suggesting what I ’d have to kill you for suggesting ! ” )
In sharp contrast to Bella ’s story , Buffy ’s narrative is one in which gender equity is sexy – and powerful , complex and independent women are the norm .
So successful is this normalization of female strength on the show that in the few alternative reality episodes that find Buffy magically weakened , we see her lack of power as utterly absurd .
Imagine Buffy being helpless , ridiculous !
The very thought is played for laughs .
Throughout Buffy ’s seven seasons , males that display the type of behavior Edward does are ridiculed or portrayed as dangerous ( or both ) .
Buffy is not without its own controversies ( especially around race and LGBTQ issues ) , but the writers did often succeed in actively and brilliantly subverting expected sexist Hollywood themes .
At first I was n’t sure if it was possible to take footage from the movie and television show and splice them together in a convincing way .
I had made remixes of popular culture before but never tried to re-construct an alternative narrative .
But I knew I had to try when I realized that the stalking scene in Twilight was extremely similar to a scene in episode 13 of Buffy .
In both sequences a female protagonist walks alone at night and is followed by shadowy figure (s ) , while dramatic music amps up the suspense .
The similarities end there .
Both scenes have radically different outcomes and narrative lessons .
In Bella ’s case , she is confronted by a group of aggressive , drunken frat boys , and actually starts to defend herself – until she ’s interrupted from the act of self - protection when the writers have Edward swoop in and save her in the nick of time .
Turns out Edward has also been stalking her ( supposedly in case she might need his help ) .
In contrast , Buffy stops in the dark ally and , annoyed , confronts her pursuer – who turns out to be her own vampire love interest , Angel — and who , you guessed it , is following her in case she might need his help .
Buffy ’s having none of it , delivering her brilliantly pointed line ( which I use in the remix ) : “ You know , being stalked is n’t really a big turn on for girls . ”
She tells
Angel she does n’t trust him and that she can take care of herself , leaving him standing rejected and alone in the ally .
To the show ’s credit , it ’s not ultimately a message of tough female individualism ;
Buffy does learn that working together with her friends and allies ( many of them also strong female characters , alongside resourceful and supportive men ) she can overcome any challenge , including saving the world — a lot .
As an aspiring feminist guy , I wanted to speak out about issues of sexism and gender oppression in media but I wanted to do so carefully and intentionally .
That ’s why I chose to focus my critique on Edward ’s patriarchal behavior in Twilight rather than on Bella ’s actions .
I did n’t feel it was my place to lecture her on desire ( even in remix form ) , especially since her character is already disempowered by the original screenplay to the point of absurdity .
So I built each scene around Edward , and then looked for appropriate responses from Buffy .
Sorting through seven seasons worth of witty dialog and dramatic footage from Buffy was a lot of fun , and telling the tale through her and her friends ’ perspective allows us to understand the messages underlying the mythology of the film and the TV show in a new way – and to enjoy the process .
I should note that I am not the first to make this critique of the Twilight series , nor did I invent the process of re-imagining pop culture stories .
I was inspired by women who have been creating fan fiction as self - conscious creative communities since before I was born .
I was heavily influenced by fannish vidding as well as by feminist critiques of popular culture , especially those of bell hooks , whose writings have helped opened my eyes on issues of race , gender and love .
Although my remix is not a “ vid ” – a fannish music video made by pairing clips from a TV show or film with a song that creates an argument or illustrates a theme – it was inspired by vidders such as Francesca Coppa and Laura Shapiro , who have both taught me much about the art form .
I was also inspired by political remix videos such as Jackie Reem Salloum ’s amazing “ Planet of the Arabs , ” which she describes as “ A trailer - esque montage spectacle of Hollywood ’s relentless vilification and dehumanization of Arabs and Muslims . ”
At their best , mash - up videos can serve as a form of critical media literacy , exposing myths and messages embedded in media typically masked by glossy Hollywood productions .
In the end the only reasonable response was to have Buffy stake Edward – not because she did n’t find him sexy , not because he was too sensitive or too eager to share his feelings – but simply because he was possessive , manipulative , and stalkery .
Lastly , interspersed among the avalanche of positive feedback are a small handful of responses from people dismayed at the death of the beloved Edward Cullen .
Often these notes express concern that my mash - up is a condemnation of the fans of Twilight or of the actor Robert Pattinson , who plays Edward .
I would like to say that the video is not intended as a stab at the fans .
Rather , it ’s an argument against the specific way in which romance and gender roles are constructed in the Twilight series .
Ultimately , Buffy ’s triumph over Edward is only one small part of much larger story : the story of our collective journey towards a world of gender equity and empowerment .

What are your thoughts on the Buffy vs. Edward mashup ?
Over at Simon Johnson 's Baseline Scenario blog , Harvard Business School professor David Moss writes a compelling post on the need for financial reform to include leverage requirements , which would require banks to have more capital to back up their borrowing .
Anyone who thinks excess leverage was n't a major cause of the financial crisis needs to study it a little harder .
If banks had n't borrowed so heavily , they would have been better able to absorb the losses associated with the mortgage market , and there may never have been a credit crisis .
My favorite part of Moss 's piece was his final paragraph , where he reminds readers that limiting leverage is not a new or un-American concept :
For those who worry that limiting leverage is somehow inconsistent with American tradition , it is worth remembering that the nation 's founders strictly limited bank leverage in their own time , frequently at less than 4 - to - 1 .
Although bank runs remained a problem in early America because of the absence of deposit insurance , the dangers of high leverage were already well appreciated .
Let 's not lose sight of that wisdom now .
Indeed , there 's nothing un-American about being prudent .
And 30 - to - 1 leverage ( what some big banks weighed in at in late 2007 , according to Moss ) is anything but prudent .
That means if a bank 's assets incur more than a 3.23 % loss , then they will become insolvent .
Yes , it may have fairly diverse assets , but if the economy gets screwed up enough , such a loss rate is possible -- as we learned in 2008 .
So what is the right level ?
That 's not an easy question to answer , but I do n't really see much harm in erring on the side of caution .
Banks will still be able to make plenty of money -- they just wo n't be able to borrow excessively to do so .
The House 's financial regulatory proposal would limit leverage to 15 - to - 1 . The Senate 's original version , 10 - to - 1 .
What we 'll finally get , however , remains unclear .
Of course , excess leverage is n't just a problem for banks : it 's also a problem for businesses and consumers .
The U.S. was overleveraged in virtually every facet of economics .
Too much borrowing and not enough assets is also part of the reason we have so many foreclosures : wacky mortgage products encouraged Americans to have little , no or even negative equity in their homes .
If a bank had required a 10 % down payment for all homes , then at least that would ensure that the borrower could n't be more than 9 - to - 1 leveraged on that loan in isolation .
If we learn anything from the financial crisis , it should be that borrowing can be a dangerous behavior .
And that lesson should be most heeded by anyone extending credit .
Lenders and counterparties should all take note .
Even in the absence of stricter leverage requirements for banks , counterparties should begin worrying about how much leverage the institutions they do business with have .
After all , if their borrowing is excessive , there 's a chance they wo n't be able to live up to all their obligations .
And creditors to both businesses and consumers should ensure that an economic shock wo n't result in defaults as well .
More prudent lending and borrowing wo n't restrain the innovative American spirit : it will ensure its survival .

US evangelist Pat Robertson said Haiti was ' cursed ' due to a voodoo ' pact with the devil ' ( PA )
As the world mourns for Haiti US evangelical broadcaster Pat Robertson has described the earthquake as " a blessing in disguise " and claimed the country has been " cursed " because of what he called a " pact with the devil " in its history .
His spokesman said the comments were based on Voodoo rituals carried out before a slave rebellion against French colonists in 1791 .
" Something happened a long time ago in Haiti , and people might not want to talk about it , " Robertson said during a broadcast .
" They ( Haitians ) were under the heel of the French ... and they got together and swore a pact to the devil .
" They said ' We will serve you ' ... and so , the devil said ' Okay , it 's a deal ' and kicked the French out . "
But spokesman Chris Roslan insisted that Robertson never stated that Tuesday 's earthquake was God 's wrath .
He said Robertson 's Operation Blessing group was sending millions of dollars in medication and relief workers to the impoverished island nation .
Robertson has angered opponents many times before with comments on current events and criticism of other faiths .
He once declared that American agents should assassinate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and said Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 's stroke was divine retribution for withdrawing from the Gaza Strip .

Why cable is going to cost you even more
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Your cable bill is going up this year -- and next year , and the year after that -- with no end in sight .
The average digital cable customer already pays almost $ 75 a month , according to research firm Centris .
And many subscribers pay more than $ 100 to tune in to everything from " The Daily Show " to " Jersey Shore . "
Customers see an average annual price hike of 5 % , analysts say -- which means that in five years they 'll be shelling out more than $ 95 a month for TV .
" There will always be an increase in cable bills , " said Miller Tabak & Co. media analyst David Joyce .
" Times are changing and providers have to make up losses somewhere , so consumers bear the brunt of it . "
The industry is getting squeezed on several fronts , and subscribers are footing the bill .
Networks are suffering as advertising dollars fall .
Cable providers are faced with competition from satellite providers and telecoms , as well as ballooning technology spending required to deliver extras like high - definition TV and programming on demand .
And every industry player is faced with the threat of Web - based television , with free or cheap content available on sites like Hulu.com and Apple 's ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) iTunes store .
" Nobody likes prices to go up , and consumers are indeed paying a lot for cable , " said Robin Flynn , senior analyst at SNL Kagan .
" But they do n't think about all that goes into it .
No one wants to hear about fiber optics , but to get you that high - definition picture the cable company had to invest a lot in their plant . "
Those pressures were reflected in the epic contract battle that raged between Time Warner Cable and Fox Network as existing agreements expired at the end of 2009 .
Fox parent News Corp. ( NWSA ) demanded $ 1 per subscriber for its broadcast network , and talks continued past the deadline as TWC ( TWC ) balked .
Reports indicate the cable outfit agreed to pay Fox more than 50 cents a subscriber .
Broadcast TV not 'a God - given right '
In the past , most providers have paid only for cable networks , but broadcasters are looking to make up for plummeting ad revenue .
Now that precedents have been set , analysts say more broadcast networks will strike similar deals with cable companies .
" Most people view their broadcast networks as if they 're a God - given right , but they cost money to produce , " said SNL Kagan 's Flynn .
" Somebody has to pay -- it 's not going to stay on Hulu forever for free . "
As cable providers are saddled with broadcast carriage fees , the shortfall is passed on to consumers .
But it is n't as simple as an extra line on the cable bill , said Miller Tabak & Co. media analyst David Joyce .
" They can increase prices a little bit for services across the board , like video on demand , to make up for the extra charges , " Joyce said .
In fact , Joyce noted , Time Warner Cable already announced an average 5 - 7 % increase for 2010 .
Of course , a hike probably would have gone into effect even without the Fox deal as other providers are also raising rates .
Reports say Cablevision ( CVC , Fortune 500 ) , Comcast ( CMCSA , Fortune 500 ) , and DirecTV ( DTV , Fortune 500 ) subscribers will see prices rise about 3.5 % .
" The way things are headed , all cable providers are going to have to pay for all broadcast channels , " Joyce said .
" They 're going to have to make up for these new charges , as well as the recession 's effect . "
Time Warner Cable likely raised rates slightly more than necessary to cover the charges , in preparation for similar broadcast deals in the future , Flynn said .
Internet killed the cable star ?
Cable companies also have to make up for the subscribers they 're losing to Web - based TV .
Viewers can now watch many of their favorite shows from online services like Hulu.com , which offer Fox , NBC and ABC programs .
The iTunes store offers a wide range of downloadable shows , and DVD options are available from Netflix ( NFLX ) to Amazon ( AMZN , Fortune 500 ) .
All of these options siphon off cable 's subscriber base .
But now that broadcasters are beginning to receive fees for that network content , it remains unclear whether they will continue releasing shows online for free .
" Networks were doing that to maintain loyalty to the shows , but content has to be paid for somehow at some point , " Flynn said .
Advertisers are also unhappy about Internet TV , as sites like Hulu offer very limited commercial interruption , noted Steven M. Rogé , portfolio manager at R. W. Rogé & Company .
The future of commercial time on Web - based platforms remains unclear , as the nascent medium continues to develop .
Of course , that endless stream of innovative technology will continue to disrupt the cable industry -- and affect customers ' bills .
" As technology becomes more advanced , we 'll soon have stuff on our screens that we can't even conceive of , " Rogé said .
" The big game - changer could be something we do n't even know about yet . "
Add - on - Con Google - the world 's largest online ad broker - sees no reason to worry about the addition of ad - blocking extensions to its Chrome browser .
Online advertisers will ensure their ads are n't too annoying , the company says , and netizens will ultimately realize that online advertising is a good thing .
" We think about this a lot at Google , because we make [ just about ] all of our money from advertising , " Google engineering director Linus Upson said on Friday at a browser - obsessed conference in Mountain View , California .
" It 's unlikely that ad blockers will get to the level where they imperil the advertising market , because if advertising is so annoying that a large segment of the population wants to block it , then advertising needs to get less annoying .
" There will always be some group of people who want to block ads for personal reasons .
But if we do a good job on the advertising side , people wo n't want to block ads .
People will find them actually useful .
" I think there will be a nice equilibrium .
If people get too aggressive with ads , then ad blockers will become more popular and companies will get less aggressive with ads .
The market will sort itself . "
Last week , the Mountain View Chocolate Factory unveiled a Mozilla - like extensions gallery for its Google Chrome browser , and though there are some restrictions on what developers can upload , Upson says there 's no explicit ban on ad blockers .
Indeed , such blockers are already available , and one - dubbed AdThwart - is listed as the gallery 's second most popular offering .
AdBlock Plus has long been among the most popular extensions at Mozilla 's Firefox gallery , AMO ( aka addon.mozilla.org ) , and Upson expects a similar situation with Chrome .
The difference is that whereas Firefox controls an estimated 25 per cent of the market , Chrome has a mere 4 per cent .
Let 's also remember that the sugary sweet spin Google puts on its online ad platforms is absolute rubbish .
Google may say that most people wo n't install ad blockers because ads are ultimately useful .
But the truth of the matter is that most people wo n't install ad blockers on Chrome because people are fundamentally lazy .
Inertia is the general rule on the web - as in life .
That 's why Google 's ad - juicing technologies are opt - out - not opt-in .
And of course , there 's no guarantee that Google will always allow ad blockers .
At this point , Google wants more market share for Chrome , believing this is the best way to feed its online ad ambitions .
The more people who use Chrome , the more people Google can point to Google services .
That means Google can collect more user data , and with more user data , it 's better able to target ads .
Certainly , allowing Chrome blockers is a path to more market share .
Many use Firefox solely for its ad - blocking extensions .
But once Chrome is ubiquitous , Google 's thinking could change .
What happens when Chrome controls 90 per cent of the market , for instance , and Google 's largest advertisers start demanding satisfaction ?
Not that this is a likely scenario .
Like we said , people are lazy .
They do n't go out of their way to use anything other than what they already have .
And you can bet that the epic amounts of data Google collects about the world 's netizens says much the same thing . ®
Now that Copenhagen is past history , what is the next step in the man -made global warming controversy ?
Without question , there should be an immediate and thorough investigation of the scientific debauchery revealed by “ Climategate . ”
If you have not heard , hackers penetrated the computers of the Climate Research Unit , or CRU , of the United Kingdom 's University of East Anglia , exposing thousands of e-mails and other documents .
CRU is one of the top climate research centers in the world .
Many of the exchanges were between top mainstream climate scientists in Britain and the U.S. who are closely associated with the authoritative ( albeit controversial ) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Among the more troubling revelations were data adjustments enhancing the perception that man is causing global warming through the release of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and other atmospheric greenhouse gases .
Particularly disturbing was the way the core IPCC scientists ( the believers ) marginalized the skeptics of the theory that man-made global warming is large and potentially catastrophic .
The e-mails document that the attack on the skeptics was twofold .
First , the believers gained control of the main climate - profession journals .
This allowed them to block publication of papers written by the skeptics and prohibit unfriendly peer review of their own papers .
Second , the skeptics were demonized through false labeling and false accusations .
Climate alarmists would like you to believe the science has been settled and all respectable atmospheric scientists support their position .
The believers also would like you to believe the skeptics are involved only because of the support of Big Oil and that they are few in number with minimal qualifications .
But who are the skeptics ?
A few examples reveal that they are numerous and well - qualified .
Several years ago two scientists at the University of Oregon became so concerned about the overemphasis on man-made global warming that they put a statement on their Web site and asked for people 's endorsement ; 32,000 have signed the petition , including more than 9,000 Ph.Ds .
More than 700 scientists have endorsed a 231 - page Senate minority report that questions man-made global warming .
The Heartland Institute has recently sponsored three international meetings for skeptics .
More than 800 scientists heard 80 presentations in March .
They endorsed an 881 - page document , created by 40 authors with outstanding academic credentials , that challenges the most recent publication by the IPCC .
The IPCC panel 's report strongly concludes that man is causing global warming through the release of carbon dioxide .
Last year 60 German scientists sent a letter to Chancellor Angela Merkel urging her to “ strongly reconsider ” her position supporting man-made global warming .
Sixty scientists in Canada took similar action .
Recently , when the American Physical Society published its support for man-made global warming , 200 of its members objected and demanded that the membership be polled to determine the APS ' true position .
What do the skeptics believe ?
First , they concur with the believers that the Earth has been warming since the end of a Little Ice Age around 1850 .
The cause of this warming is the question .
Believers think the warming is man-made , while the skeptics believe the warming is natural and contributions from man are minimal and certainly not potentially catastrophic à la Al Gore .
Second , skeptics argue that CO2 is not a pollutant but vital for plant life .
Numerous field experiments have confirmed that higher levels of CO2 are positive for agricultural productivity .
Furthermore , carbon dioxide is a very minor greenhouse gas .
More than 90 percent of the warming from greenhouse gases is caused by water vapor .
If you are going to change the temperature of the globe , it must involve water vapor .
Third , and most important , skeptics believe that climate models are grossly overpredicting future warming from rising concentrations of carbon dioxide .
We are being told that numerical models that cannot make accurate 5 - to 10 - day forecasts can be simplified and run forward for 100 years with results so reliable you can impose an economic disaster on the U.S. and the world .
The revelation of Climate­gate occurs at a time when the accuracy of the climate models is being seriously questioned .
Over the last decade Earth 's temperature has not warmed , yet every model ( there are many ) predicted a significant increase in global temperatures for that time period .
If the climate models cannot get it right for the past 10 years , why should we trust them for the next century ?
Climategate reveals how predetermined political agendas shaped science rather than the other way around .
It is high time to question the true agenda of the scientists now on the hot seat and to bring skeptics back into the public debate .

Australian woman Kathleen Evans , 66 , from New South Wales ( UK ) was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer in 1993 and was given 2 months to live .
But Kathleen did n’t give up hope .
She regularly prayed to Mother Mary MacKillop and wore her relic .
Ten months after the diagnosis , the cancerous tumor was gone leaving behind medical experts baffled .
“ I ’m not on my knees all the time , I ’m just an ordinary person .
If I miss mass , I do n’t think I ’m going to go to hell or anything like that , ” she said .
But in her greatest hour of need , when she was so sick with cancer that her husband would have to lie on her to stop her shaking , a close friend gave Mrs Evans a relic of Mary MacKillop .
She pinned it to her nightie , and began praying to God , with Mary MacKillop ’s help .
“ All I had left was prayer .
I was a great believer in prayer , ” she said .
“ I was unable to get out of bed for any length of time . . .
I could n’t bath or shower or even use the toilet on my own . ”
As she continued praying , Mrs Evans ’s aches and pains began to ease .
“ Instead of my health deteriorating , I started getting stronger , ” she said .
As her health improved , Mrs Evans defied doctors who told her “ you should n’t be here ” .
Exactly 10 - months after being diagnosed with cancer , Mrs Evans went back for more tests which revealed the tumours had gone .
“ There was no sign of cancer anywhere , just scarring where the cancer had been , ” she said .
Her doctor even requested the tests be repeated because there was no explanation for the cure .
“ I did n’t have any treatment , so there was no explanation there , ” she said .

Cossimo Cavallaro is an artist ; a very unique artist who uses occasionally uses edible objects in his work .
For example , he once repainted a New York hotel room in melted mozzarella cheese and he ’s covered a bed in processed ham .
This time it ’s chocolate .
Man cannot live on bread alone , but if he were to consume Cosimo Cavallaro ’s newest creation he could live off of Jesus — for approximately eight months .
An oddball artist known for his “ eclectic ” forms of expression , Cavallaro ’s latest contribution to culture is a six - foot tall , anatomically - correct milk - chocolate sculpture of Jesus Christ .
His confectionary Christ is made with more than 200 pounds of chocolate , containing approximately 480,000 calories .

According to yumsugar , the sculpture goes on display April 1st ( no this is n’t a joke ) at the Lab gallery in the Roger Smith Hotel in New York .
A Collection of paintings , stories , posturings and general detritus from your humble narrator .
Late last year I wrote a an article about Tyler Kennedy and his amazing underlying stats .
At the time Penguins were in full turnaround mode and the accolades were going to Sergei Gonchar on his return from injury .
But Kennedy was effective even when Gonchar was down .
In fact , he was at times the most effective Penguin on the ice .
The conclusion was as follows :
Barring injury , given his age and his game , it 's not a stretch to see the new Teke as a 20 - 25 goal man on the right wing for stretch of five to seven seasons .
Someone in the Penguins scouting department deserves some serious praise for this find --
Teke looks like a guy that is going to get 750 games in this league .
Players like Kennedy - those that get the puck going in the right direction and make their teammates better while staying completely under the radar are n't easy to find ...
Kennedy remained strong through the playoffs and Bylsma hard - matched the Cooke - Staal - Kennedy line against the best the opposing team could muster as often as he could .
I remain convinced that Dan Bylsma is either tracking his own advanced stats or using Vic Ferarri 's site .
Though Kennedy has been banged up this year , the trend continues .
He 's taking the tough assignments , taking the bad starting position and he 's outshooting and outscoring once again .
Pittsburgh 's new " Teke " continues to show his versatility and effectiveness .
Below the break is an updated look at Kennedy 's underlying stats and his effect on his teammates .
Kennedy is still getting the difficult starting position - out of thirteen qualifying forwards , he ranks ninth in offensive zone starts .
His qualcomp is 4/13 , behind only Sidney Crosby , Chris Kunitz and Bill Guerin and his qualteam is 3/13 .
Despite the starting position and qualcomp , he continues to outshoot and his Corsi value ranks 3/13 on the Penguins .
If someone were tracking scoring chances for the Penguins , I 'd expect Kennedy 's rate to be among the top four on the team .
The most telling stat about Kennedy ?
Look at his EV +/- on per 60 : 1.19 , He 's ranked second on the Penguins and has outscored his opponents 21 - 13 while on the ice at even strength .
When healthy , Kennedy has continued his even strength dominance .
Often overlooked is Kennedy 's value to Jordan Staal .
The young centerman is the apple of many general manager 's eyes because of his remarkable potential .
However , his current performance is greatly enhanced by the presence of Tyler Kennedy , something that can be seen through Kennedy 's injury time this year .
Overall , Staal has outscored his opponents 37 - 25 and outshot at a rate of .521 ( 310 SF - 284 SA ) while on at even strength .
Together with Kennedy , they 've outscored 14 - 6 and outshot at a .541 ( 156 SF - 132 SA ) rate .
Without Kennedy , Staal still outscores , 23 - 19 , and barely outshoots with a .503 ( 154 SF - 152 SA ) rate .
The sample size argument is relevant , but in reading the breakdown from last year , these same numbers hold .
Tyler Kennedy has been driving results at even strength for the Penguins .
Players like Kennedy are examples of why advanced statistics should be studied closely .
Stephen Weiss is another .
Talking heads everywhere are calling this Weiss ' breakout year because the puck is going into the net .
For the last two years , Weiss has been starting in his own end , taking on the toughest matchups and outscoring them .
Breakout year ?
Try 2007 - 2008 .
Dustin Penner has amazed pundits with his point totals this year , but the underlying numbers showed a player that has been moving the puck the right way and outshooting his opponents for awhile .
Who would have thought that among all of those stars last year in Pittsburgh , Tyler Kennedy was the only man outshooting his opponents and doing it with the worst teammates ?
Who would have known that he was a key to the Penguins lineup because he was outscoring whoever was on the ice against him ?
Not who , but what , in this case .
The underlying stats showed Kennedy was having success when the Penguins were struggling mightily .
The underlying stats find the gems that can help a general manager save both his team and his cap situation from falling apart .
Minh “ Gooseman ” Le , creator of the almighty Counter - Strike , is gearing up to launch his new shooter , Tactical Intervention .
The game is set to enter beta in the first half of this year with a worldwide release sometime thereafter .
Published by FIX Korea , Tactical Intervention will once again focus on team play .
The game utilizes the Source engine and pits terrorists against counter - terrorists inÂ “ modern battle . ”
Gee , this is sounding awfully familiar .
Tactical Intervention will also feature “ real - like ” weapon and character design , K9 units and hostage NPCs that are n’t morons .
“ Counter - Strike - type of game is proven to be a success throughout regions such as Asia , Europe , and North America , ” commented Le . “ It is quite challenging to balance between bringing out familiarity and new system at the same time , but I can guarantee you will have fun paying it . ”
Count us in !

Lunch on the run : Shocking moment LIVE cow is fed to five hungry tigers in front of tourists
Visiting a wildlife park is often an opportunity to witness nature up close .
But imagine one group of tourist 's surprise when several hungry tigers tucked into a live cow right in front of them .
These pictures show the shocking moment tourist guides fed a live cow to five hungry tigers .
Tucking in : A group of tourists watch on in horror as a live cow is fed to a group of tigers
Head to head :
The cow valiantly attempts to take on a tiger at the Siberian Tiger Park , in Harbin , China
The shocked visitors watched from the safety of their buses as the fearsome beasts launched into a feeding frenzy .
The cow had been dumped from the back of a truck and made a brave attempt to escape before being overcome by the powerful tigers .
Amateur photographer Chris Geddes , 31 , captured the images on a trip to the Siberian Tiger Park , in Harbin , China .
He said : ' I had heard that the Siberian Tiger Park was a famous tourist attraction in the area and I jumped at the chance to go .
' After a brief walk through the traditional zoo - like cages and some more spacious enclosures , we were loaded on to one of six buses for the guided tour of the park .
' The park was spread across several square kilometres of land with a meandering dirt road .
Horror : Within several seconds the cow fell to the ground , unable to stave off the tigers ' attack
Amateur photographer Chris Geddes , 31 , captured the images on a trip to the wildlife park
' Along the way we saw lions and tigers aplenty mostly asleep in the shade of trees next to the road .
' After 20 minutes the buses formed a ring in an open dirt field where we were joined by several jeeps carrying park employees .
' Clearly this event was anticipated by a group of five tigers who immediately appeared from beneath the adjacent trees . '
Father - of - one Chris , from Ontario , Canada , said park staff threw meat to the tigers and then released three live chickens and a pheasant .
Chris added : ' The athleticism of the tigers was clearly apparent and the crowd were enjoying the photo opportunity .
' What came next , however , was utterly unexpected .
The cow had been dumped from the back of a truck and made a brave attempt to escape before being overcome by the powerful tigers
Stand off :
The tigers close in on the cow that seemed ' generally unwell ' to one tourist
' A large dump truck reversed into the ring of buses while the armoured jeeps drove quickly around the perimeter in an attempt to energise the tigers .
' I looked at my friend in disbelief as the back of the truck lifted and a live cow slid out landing on its back .
' The cow , which appeared generally unwell , clambered to it 's feet as two tigers approached , one taking the offensive lead .
' Within several seconds the cow fell to the ground , unable to stave off the cats ' attack .
' Two other cats joined in to end the struggle .
I could not believe my eyes . '
Orthopaedic surgeon Chris said when he and his friend came to leave the park they spotted a ' menu ' with prices for various animals to be thrown to the tigers alive .

Why do we chew our food ?
Research has shown that it is not , as has long been presumed , to make chunks of food small enough to swallow without choking .
Biomechanics , who have modelled the cohesive strength of food after a certain amount of chewing , have shown that we actually chew our food to ensure it is in a firm blob and , therefore , safe to swallow .
Writing in January 's Physics World , Dr Roland Ennos , a biomechanic in the Faculty of Life Sciences at University of Manchester , explains how we need to look beyond obvious answers if we are to understand how our own bodies work .
Explaining why we swing our arms , why we have notched teeth , why our fingernails always break in the same direction , and , still puzzling , why we have fingerprints , Dr Ennos shows how rich the boundary between biology and physics is in , some counter - intuitive but , potentially significant discoveries .
On the fingerprint puzzle , we know that fingerprints are useful to identify people for security and crime detection , but no scientist has ever suggested that fingerprints evolved specifically for this purpose .
It has been thought that fingerprints help us to grip more tightly to objects , but tests show that a rough surface does not actually increase the friction of soft materials such as skin .
Fingerprint friction is therefore a mystery that has left Dr Ennos 's team testing a number of options - it could be that fingerprints act like the treads on tyres , removing water and so increasing friction under wet conditions .
Another possibility is that prints also make the skin more flexible and stop it blistering .
As Dr Ennos writes , " The answers to these questions may appear obvious or even trivial , but further thought and experiment is revealing that our world is far more fascinating than we could have dreamed . "
What 's more , this sort of research , unlike many areas of physics , is not expensive or mathematically hard .
" All you need is an enquiring mind , a bit of ingenuity and the courage to ask awkward questions , " concludes Dr Ennos .

Also in the January edition :
[ WARNING : content will be disturbing to most . ]
Most of us ( thankfully ) never have had to experience any of these parasites .
Though there are people who are at risk everyday and have to go through these horrid symptoms and even risk death if infected , or more so , infested .
10 Taeniasis ( Tapeworm )
Taeniasis is a tapeworm infection .
Tapeworm infestation does not usually cause any symptoms .
Infection is generally recognized when the infected person passes segments of proglottids in the stool , especially if the segment is moving .
Mmm sounds like fun !
Not .
People acquire tapeworms by eating undercooked meat or freshwater fish that contain tapeworm cysts .
Tapeworms in the intestine usually cause no symptoms but may cause abdominal discomfort , diarrhea , and loss of appetite .
Though however if they are in the brain , larval cysts cause various symptoms , such as headaches , seizures , and confusion .
[ JFrater : Given the choice of a picture of the worm itself , and the picture above , it was a no - brainer . ]
9 Bot Fly Larva
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2kuGGmx6DU
Only one bot fly species attacks humans , the Dermatobia hominis .
Eggs are deposited in animal skin directly , or the larvae drop from the egg : the body heat of the animal induces hatching upon contact .
Infestation can be caused by larvae burrowing into the skin of the host animal .
They do not kill the host animal , and thus are true parasites ( though some species of rodent - infesting botflies do consume the host ’s testes / ovaries ) .
You can cause them to suffocate by placing smoke over your wound or tape where they then try to come to the surface and you can then extract these pests .
The disgusting video clip above shows an extraction from a human head .
8 Ascaris infection
Ascariasis is the most common human worm infection .
Infection occurs worldwide and is most common in tropical and subtropical areas where sanitation and hygiene are poor .
Children are infected more often than adults .
In the United States , infection is rare , but most common in rural areas of the southeast .
Anesthesia appears to agitate the worms and when there is infection of adults in the lungs they can exit the mouth and nose .
The normal life cycle of ascaris is to migrate to the lungs for the larval stage and grow to an adult in the intestines , but sometimes the adults reside in the lungs .
Ascaris eggs are found in human feces .
After feces contaminates the soil , the eggs become infectious after a few weeks .
Infection occurs when a person accidentally ingests infectious Ascaris eggs .
Once in the stomach , immature worms hatch from the eggs .
The larvae are carried through the lungs and then to the throat where they are swallowed .
Once swallowed , they reach the intestines and develop into adult worms .
Adult female worms lay eggs that are then passed in feces ; this cycle takes between 2 - 3 months .
I could n’t imagine that something like that wriggling out of me !
If you do n’t believe they can come out of the nose and mouth , take a look at this picture [ warning : do n’t – it is revolting ] .
7 Onchocerciasis
Also known as river blindness , this is the world ’s second leading infectious cause of blindness .
It is caused by Onchocerca volvulus , a nematode that can live for up to fifteen years in the human body .
It is transmitted to humans through the bite of a black fly .
The worms spread throughout the body , and when they die , they cause intense itching and a strong immune system response that can destroy nearby tissue , such as the eye which causes the blindness .
6 Lymphatic Filariasis
A parasitic and infectious tropical disease that is caused by thread - like filarial nematode worms .
These worms occupy the lymphatic system , including the lymph nodes , and in chronic cases these worms lead to the disease Elephantiasis – as seen above .
5 Guinea Worms
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFcEDr35O9c
First swallowed by a water flea , the Guinea worm transforms into a third stage larvae .
The flea , ingested by a human being , is consumed by the stomach ’s juices and the larvae of the Guinea Worm are released .
They remain in the stomach for up to three months .
After mating , the male dies and the female bores through the body making her way to the extremities , usually the lower leg or foot , but she can go to any part of the body .
Once settled , just under the skin , she begins to grow , by eating the flesh of her carrier , and turns into a three to five foot worm .
This worm is about as big around as a piece of spaghetti .
While growing , she causes severe pain and cripples the carrier , so that they are not able to move .
As the worm matures , a painful blister appears on the skin of the carrier .
When the person puts the affected part of the body in water , the blister breaks and hundreds of thousands of tiny first stage larvae are released into the water .
The adult female worm then comes slowly out of the body of its carrier through the sore made by the broken blister .
It usually takes several weeks for the worm to completely exit the body .
4 Cutaneous leishmaniasis
A skin infection caused by a single celled parasite that is transmitted by sand fly bites .
The sandfly vector is a 2 - mm long , hairy fly .
These flies are able to pass through the usual netting used for mosquitoes .
Sand flies are found around human habitations and breed in specific organic wastes such as feces , manure , rodent burrows , and leaf litter .
Cutaneous leishmaniasis manifests as painful sores that could , if infected , lead to death .
3 Screw - worm fly
An insect parasite of warm - blooded animals .
The fly has red eyes and a shiny blue - green body and looks similar to Australian blowflies .
Flies lay eggs on the edge of open wounds from scratches , injury , branding , dehorning or castration .
Larvae hatch and feed on the underlying flesh causing extensive tissue damage .
Left untreated , animals can die from infection and loss of tissue fluid .
Its known for the larvae to eat their host from the inside out !
2 African trypanosomiasis sleeping sickness
A vector - borne parasitic disease , this disease is transmitted through the bite of an infected tsetse fly .
At first they multiply in subcutaneous tissues , blood and lymph .
In time , the parasites cross the blood - brain barrier to infect the central nervous system .
Tsetse flies are found in Sub-Saharan Africa .
Only certain species transmit the disease .
They are mainly found in vegetation by rivers and lakes , in gallery - forests and in vast stretches of wooded savannah .
When symptoms do emerge , the patient is often already in an advanced disease stage when the central nervous system is affected .
The first stage of the disease , known as a haemolymphatic phase , entails bouts of fever , headaches , joint pains and itching .
The second stage , known as the neurological phase , begins when the parasite crosses the blood - brain barrier and invades the central nervous system .
In general this is when the signs and symptoms of the disease appear : confusion , sensory disturbances and poor coordination .
Disturbance of the sleep cycle , which gives the disease its name , is an important feature of the second stage of the disease .
Without treatment , sleeping sickness is fatal .
1 Naegleria brain - eating amoeba
Do n’t drink the water .
And while you ’re at it , you might not want to take any chances by putting your head in it , either .
Naegleria fowleri , a not - so - friendly little amoeba , makes its home in warm fresh water in the American Southwest .
That ’s not such a problem , but it occasionally also likes to make its home in people ’s brains , which is a bit of a problem .
Infection with Naegleria causes the disease primary amebic meningoencephalitis ( PAM ) , a brain inflammation , which leads to the destruction of brain tissue .
Initial signs and symptoms of PAM start 1 to 14 days after infection .
These symptoms include headache , fever , nausea , vomiting , and stiff neck .
As the amoeba cause more extensive destruction of brain tissue this leads to confusion , lack of attention to people and surroundings , loss of balance , seizures , and hallucinations .
After the onset of symptoms , the disease progresses rapidly and usually results in death within 3 to 7 days .
+ Candiru
This is a bonus item courtesy of Top 10 Worst Things in Nature .
The Candiru is a small parasitic catfish which is found mostly in the Amazon river where it is the most feared fish – even more so than piranhas .
The fish can grow to a maximum length of around six inches .
Candiru feed on the blood of their host creatures by swimming into the gills and using razor sharp spines on its head to attach itself .
It then chews its way through the host until it reaches a major artery and drinks blood until it is satiated .
The fish finds its prey by sniffing the water and this is where it starts to get nasty : the smell of human urine appeals to candirus and they can find their way to a human penis or vagina under the water and enter it .
When this happens , the fish attaches itself ( causing great pain to the poor human ) and it can generally only be removed through surgery .
This is a very unpleasant situation to be in – so be warned : do n’t pee in the Amazon river .

Mills corrotto da Berlusconi
ma la disinformazione
crea l'assoluzione
Bologna , 27 febbraio 2010
( avv. Antonello Tomanelli )
Non c’è da meravigliarsi se il presidente del Consiglio Silvio Berlusconi , all ’indomani della sentenza della Corte di Cassazione sul caso Mills , parla di “ persecuzione delle toghe ” ed esclama : “ Che non si ripeta mai più ” , dando così per scontata la propria assoluzione .
E’ parte in causa , è comprensibile che menta .
Ma le menzogne divulgate da soggetti deontologicamente vincolati al dovere di verità , ossia i giornalisti , rappresentano crepe nell ’ ordinamento democratico , fondato anche sulla naturale fiducia che la collettività nutre nei riguardi dei professionisti dell ’informazione .
Un dovere di verità violato in vari modi .
La maniera più eclatante è stravolgere completamente la decisione della Cassazione , dicendo che Mills è stato “ assolto ” .
Niente di più falso .
La Cassazione ha confermato che Mills fu corrotto da Berlusconi , quindi è colpevole .
Ma è passato troppo tempo dalla commissione del reato : 10 anni e 2 mesi per l’esattezza .
E il reato di corruzione , grazie alla legge n. 251 del 2005 ( cosiddetta ex Cirielli ) , ha oggi un termine prescrizionale di 10 anni ( contro i vecchi 15 ) .
Dunque , Mills è stato giudicato colpevole di corruzione in atti giudiziari .
La Cassazione ha confermato il fatto che Berlusconi corruppe Mills .
Ma ha dovuto “ salvarlo ” perché il reato è ormai prescritto .
Ora proseguirà il processo contro Berlusconi , che certamente si concluderà con una condanna , visto che se per la Cassazione Mills è colpevole ( ma prescritto ) , lo è anche Berlusconi , avendo lui corrotto l’avvocato inglese .
Ma per Berlusconi i termini prescrizionali non sono ancora scaduti , essendo rimasti sospesi durante la vigenza del Lodo Alfano , poi dichiarato incostituzionale dalla Consulta .
Per Berlusconi , la prescrizione arriverà fra 1 anno .
Un tempo certamente sufficiente perché si arrivi almeno alla condanna di primo grado .
Ovviamente a dire ciò sono pochi .
Il tg1 , che conta milioni di telespettatori , nei titoli di apertura ha espressamente parlato di “ assoluzione ” , facendo credere ai telespettatori che David Mills è stato dichiarato innocente , quindi un perseguitato .
Ha dato spazio all ’avv.
Niccolò Ghedini , secondo il quale la Corte di Cassazione “ ha certificato l’insussistenza del reato ” , senza uno straccio di giornalista che gli facesse notare , come di dovere , che si trattava di una spudorata menzogna .
Poi , “ Il Giornale ” , in un coraggioso articolo a firma Claudio Borghi dal titolo “ Silvio perseguitato , ma nessuno paga ” , addirittura paventa l’ipotesi che quei magistrati che “ a detta della Cassazione ” ( ma secondo la sua faziosa interpretazione ) hanno sbagliato a condannare Mills nei precedenti gradi di giudizio , dovrebbero pagare per il danno all ’immagine inflitto a Berlusconi .
Qui vi è un curioso rovesciamento della realtà .
La Cassazione , infatti , dice che i magistrati dei precedenti gradi di giudizio hanno giustamente condannato Mills perché colpevole del reato contestatogli , tant'è che hanno confermato il risarcimento di Euro 250 mila che Mills dovrà pagare alla Presidenza del Consiglio costituitasi parte civile attraverso l’Avvocatura dello Stato .
Insomma , secondo “ Il Giornale ” , in tutti questi anni Berlusconi ha subito un danno all ’immagine a causa di quei magistrati che l’hanno inutilmente perseguitato .
In realtà , è Mills che ha causato un danno all ’immagine dell ’ente Stato , facendosi corrompere da Berlusconi , che di fatto è concorrente nel reato .
Stiamo parlando di eclatanti violazioni del dovere deontologico di verità .
Per quanto riguarda l’articolo su “ Il Giornale ” , esso è l ’inevitabile conseguenza di un conflitto di interessi che obbliga , per contratto , l’articolista a subordinare il dovere deontologico di verità a quello di fedeltà nei confronti del proprio datore di lavoro , che è anche presidente del Consiglio .
Nel caso del tg1 , però , la violazione è molto più grave , in quanto non vi è alcun rapporto di lavoro tra il premier e chi conduce il tg1 .
Si è mentito alla collettività per tutelare gli interessi del presidente del Consiglio .
Qui è pienamente violato anche il dovere di autonomia ( “ La responsabilità del giornalista verso i cittadini prevale sempre nei confronti di qualsiasi altra .
Il giornalista non può mai subordinarla ad interessi di altri e particolarmente a quelli dell ’editore , del governo o di altri organismi dello Stato ” , si legge nella Carta dei Doveri ) .
La Carta dei Doveri vuole che quello tra giornalista e collettività sia inteso come rapporto privilegiato .
Il dovere di autonomia è violato ogni volta che il giornalista privilegia un altro tipo di rapporto , sacrificando quello con la collettività .
In un regime , la subordinazione del giornalista agli interessi del governo è fisiologica .
In una democrazia costituisce un tradimento della collettività , che andrebbe punito dall ’Ordine competente con una sanzione adeguata .
Alissa J. Rubin reports that a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest made his way into an American base in Khost Province in southeastern Afghanistan , killing at least six Americans .
The New York Times
The bomber managed to elude security and reach the base ’s gym , said one official , who did not want to be identified because the official was not authorized to speak about the incident .
The official said the attack took place at Forward Operating Base Chapman , which one official described as “ not a regular base , ” suggesting that it was used by American intelligence agencies .
It was unclear exactly where on the base the explosion occurred .
On a snowy winter day , with a blizzard brewing outside and idle hands inside , my thoughts drifted to dinner .
What can I make that is all at once comforting , belly - warming , delicious and timely ?
Risotto , that 's what , as white as the snow piling up on the windowsill , to chase away the chills and offer respite from that cruel , unrelenting world outside the door .
Risotto is really quite easy to make if you have the right ingredients on hand and only a minimal measure of gumption .
My inspiration was the snowstorm .
All that whiteness flying around made me think of the glistening grains of Arborio rice , sizzling in olive oil
It also made me think of my Milanese friend Silvana , who so passionately showed me her tips for authentic white risotto a few years back .
There was a speech delivered that day .
Proper Milanese risotto , she sternly lectured , is not flavored and colored by saffron , but pure white , like snow .
" Any real Milanese cook will always serve their osso buco with white risotto , not yellow , " she snorted , gesticulating with her hands dramatically , as if she wanted to take a swipe at anyone approaching with a pinch of saffron .
I took her point , nodding seriously , and offered no arguments .
Now , I 'm not entirely sure of the accuracy of her statement , which flew in the face of everything I 'd previously known about this iconic dish , but I was n't going to mess with her at that point .
Making Chicken Stock
For my snow day risotto , I wanted some basic chicken stock .
You can actually make darn good risotto with plain and always - available water .
Chicken stock gilds the lily , and who does n't want a gilded lily in pursuit of comfort food .
I checked the freezer and pulled out the wings , neck , back , and feet I had clipped from my last roasted bird before it went in the oven .
Into a pot they went with the basics : carrot , onion , celery , bay leaf , black peppercorns , parsley , a bit of thyme .
No browning of the chicken or veggies this time , and none of the usual tomato bits I sometimes like to add to my stock .
Two hours , and about four inches of snow later , I had aromatic and flavorful , but pale , chicken stock ready for my risotto .
The other ingredients required are Arborio rice , of course , olive oil , onion , a bit of white wine , butter , and grated Parmigiano - Reggiano or Grana Padano cheese .
I 've got this pale theme down pat .
Risotto - Making Tips
Here are some pointers to keep in mind when making your risotto .
First , dice the onions about the same size as the grains of rice , which will allow them to distribute their flavor evenly and melt into the finished risotto .
which will allow them to distribute their flavor evenly and melt into the finished risotto .
Never , ever , rinse the rice , which would wash away the starch that is essential to the dish .
which would wash away the starch that is essential to the dish .
Make sure you toast the grains of rice properly , a step known as tostatura in Italian .
Use just enough olive oil to coat the rice completely , and keep it moving ; the point is not to brown them , but to break down the outer coating of the rice to allow the starch to slowly release as you cook it in the liquid .
Listen for the crackling , popping sound as you toast the rice ; that is when you will know that step is complete .

Finally , remember that perfect risotto is a fleeting thing ; make it , have warm bowls ready for serving , and enjoy it moments out of the pan .
Use any leftovers to make crispy risotto cakes .
It turns quite gloppy when cold and simply does not reheat .
The recipe below is for four servings ; this recipe can easily be doubled or tripled as necessary ; you 'll add more stock each time , and amount of cooking time in between each addition will be longer .
You can interrupt the pure snowy whiteness of the finished risotto with finely chopped parsley , if desired .
Fusion power has been held up by our inability to get the reaction hot and dense enough to self - sustain , or maintain its own temperature without externally - provided heat .
By studying the magnetic fields of planets and other bodies in space , scientists have found a new configuration of magnetic fields that could help concentrate the density of the fuel .
The setup uses a levitating magnet to help the plasma to move across magnetic field lines , which maintains its high density , eliminates particle loss , and may even allow for the use of cheaper helium - 3 as fuel .
Fusion requires the reacting plasma to be well - confined , or densely packed , and the particles involved have to remain in that area to keep energy losses at a minimum .
This helps the plasma achieve the Lawson criterion , the set of conditions needed for a plasma to not only reach ignition , but remain sufficiently confined to continue reacting and releasing energy .
For many reactor designs , this means confining the plasma using magnetic fields .
What 's that got to do with planets ?
Scientists have discovered that solar activity can create fluctuations in the magnetic fields present in space .
These fields can help drive streams of particles , even hot and active ones such as those from solar wind , into a narrow area , creating a high density .
Normally , particles like to travel along the same magnetic field lines , like fish swimming with the current of a stream .
However , the fluctuations in a field can push the particles to change field lines and move along planes of similar magnetic strength , like fish swimming across the stream current .
In the case of solar wind and Earth , random fluctuations of the solar wind can cause its particles to move across the magnetic field of Earth , rather than along it , equalizing the number of particles that sit on each thread of the magnetic field .
The net effect is a denser population of particles in those areas that have equal magnetic strength — precisely the sort of thing we'd want to see in a fusion reactor .
The problem is this cross - field transport of particles is difficult to replicate — when a particle is on a field line , it wants to stay there .
In the newly described experiments , researchers were able to create fluctuations in a lab that were similar to ones seen in space , and use them to produce a higher density plasma .
The scientists involved magnetically levitated a superconducting current ring , which created a dipole magnetic field similar to the one generated by a planet like Earth .
In this setup , the magnetic field lines pass through the center of the current ring and produce a large amount of closed field lines that the particles can travel along and , most importantly , between , when given the right fluctuations .
Once the fuel was in the system , the researchers heated it using microwaves , and found that the configuration of magnetic fields produced and sustained a very strong turbulent pinch , or compression of the fuel by magnetic forces .
The compression force was so strong , in fact , that the system may be able to use a fuel cycle based on deuterium and less - reactive helium - 3 , rather than the usual , more expensive fusion fuel , deuterium and tritium .
In typical fusion configurations , an issue that usually needs to be dealt with is a rogue population of hot electrons created by the initial heating ; these make the fuel unstable and more likely to disperse .
However , the levitating dipole configuration kept the the rogue electron population to a minimum — the apparatus did n't work nearly as well with the device locked in place .
While the experiment successfully replicated the conditions necessary to generate a tighter pinch from particle motions across the magnetic field , there are many details of how and why the setup works that must be sorted out .
They 're not currently sure how the microwaves help create the field fluctuations , or the structure of the plasma that gets produced .
Nonetheless , the ability to create a more well - defined pinch , and therefore use less expensive fuel , may be helpful steps on the road to viable fusion power .

I attended the speech given by Secretary Clinton on Jan 21 , 2010 , http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm.
Most of it was a rehashing of what many of us already know and believe , but it 's still good to hear the US Govt " gets it " and is trying to promote the openness on which the Internet has thrived .
You can watch the full speech at http://netfreedom.state.gov.
Interestingly , someone got to ask the anonymity question before me ,
QUESTION : You talked about anonymity on line and how we have to prevent that .
But you also talk about censorship by governments .
And I ’m struck by – having a veil of anonymity in certain situations is actually quite beneficial .
So are you looking to strike a balance between that and this emphasis on censorship ?
SECRETARY CLINTON : Absolutely .
I mean , this is one of the challenges we face .
On the one hand , anonymity protects the exploitation of children .
And on the other hand , anonymity protects the free expression of opposition to repressive governments .
Anonymity allows the theft of intellectual property , but anonymity also permits people to come together in settings that gives them some basis for free expression without identifying themselves .
None of this will be easy .
I think that ’s a fair statement .
I think , as I said , we all have varying needs and rights and responsibilities .
But I think these overriding principles should be our guiding light .
We should err on the side of openness and do everything possible to create that , recognizing , as with any rule or any statement of principle , there are going to be exceptions .
So how we go after this , I think , is now what we ’re requesting many of you who are experts in this area to lend your help to us in doing .
We need the guidance of technology experts .
In my experience , most of them are younger than 40 , but not all are younger than 40 .
And we need the companies that do this , and we need the dissident voices who have actually lived on the front lines so that we can try to work through the best way to make that balance you referred to .
Like most televison viewers , I have been frozen into a sort of moral torpor by the realization of the magnitude of the devastation in Haiti .
While the death toll estimates from the original quake are staggering , it is scarcely thinkable what is happening now .
Given the appalling lack of infrastructure — relief planes unable to land at the overloaded airport , roads impassable or non-existent — some fortunate to have survived the original collapse may now remain trapped and unreachable .
What they and their families , in Haiti or in the extensive Haitian diaspora , are contending with now is very difficult to imagine .
It is so bad that it invites the moralizing of nature , compelling many to conclude that what has been visited on this island is evil , not simply bad .
Susan Neiman tells a compelling story about how , arguably for the first time in the Modern period , western people began to see natural disasters in moral terms .
The Lisbon earthquake of 1755 did more than level a city and kill countless thousands of its inhabitants ; it also toppled the carefully constructed Early Modern edifice : a belief in the goodness and orderliness of the natural world .
As Nieman puts it , the eighteenth century invoked the name of Lisbon in much the way twentieth century people would invoke Auschwitz .
The temptation to moralize disaster , once it achieves a certain level , is very powerful and runs very deep , though I trust it is clear that I do not intend this observation in quite the way that Pat Robertson did .
Anthea Butler has helpfully unmasked the theological oddity of viewing this earthquake as divine punishment visited on an entire island for the alleged “ deal with the devil ” one man made over two hundred years ago .
The Reverend speaks of the devil , but what he really has in mind is a characteristic Afro-Caribbean form of quasi-Christian religious practice : Vodou , with its spirit possession , sacrifices , and all .
The old quip about Haiti — that the nation is “ 85 % Catholic , 15 % Protestant , and 100 % Vodou ” — has long legs and longer appeal .
These percentages have been very helpfully emended in a companion piece on RD by Michelle Gonzalez Maldonado , who reminds us of the intense evangelical Protestant attention paid to Central America and the Caribbean in the past thirty years .
Protestant conversion , especially to Pentecostal forms of the faith , is dramatically on the rise , making Robertson ’s theological assessment of the situation on Haiti almost bizarre .
The scale of the destruction , the hopelessness of the situation , the staggering poverty , the confusing religious face of Haiti … all of these ideas continue to inform a great deal of idle speculation among those of us who have no earthly idea what to do or what to say in the face of the quake , its appalling magnitude , and its somewhat surreal cultural aftermath .
For there is a moralism of the left as well as of the right .
That the country which emerged from the first successful slave rebellion in the New World continues to be the poorest nation in the entire western hemisphere lends itself to righteous finger - wagging , western incrimination , and more .
I am most struck by the modern - ness of these matters , as well as by Nietzsche ’s patient cautioning about the potential abuse built in to the language of “ good and evil . ”
The paradox , one well noted by Nietzsche , is that I , located confidently on the political left , become positively moralistic in my outrage at Pat Robertson ’s moral analysis of the Haitian disaster .
None of this helps the Haitians , and Nietzsche believed that it does not do much for me either .
Haiti presents a problem that looms far larger than its current agony .
Haiti offers a cautionary tale for the historian of the Early Modern world as well .
Here , it would seem , are the historical highlights .
The 1500s were consumed by internecine religious conflict in Europe , a century of contestation between Reformation and Counter - Reformation that became intensely and horrifically violent in the 1600s , inspiring increasing numbers of European colonists to flee the Old World and to cross the Atlantic .
So bad had things become that the great “ rights revolutions ” — beginning with the so - called Glorious Revolution in England in 1688 , and culminating in the French Revolution in 1789 — allied themselves to various degrees with the cause of “ secular politics . ”
If religious conflict was destined to be so violent and so intractable , then best to leave it out of a political process that had peace as its primary aspiration .
The Lisbon earthquake violated that peace .
As does Haiti today .
On the plus side of the ledger , the rights revolutions that contribute to making us Modern possessed enormous liberatory power : nation - states and enslaved peoples gained their independence in the 1800s ; colonies became “ post - colonial ” and women got the vote in the 1900s .
But what of Haiti ?
The French Revolution ’s founding charters , like the so - called Rights of Man , properly saw an indelible contradiction between these liberal Modern ideals and institutions of human enslavement .
West Africans and indigenous peoples on the island of Hispaniola must be free .
And so they were , for a moment .
But as Revolution turned to Terror ( tellingly enough , many Haitians were supremely shocked by the appearance of the first guillotine on their island , and stomped it to bits after seeing it used just once … so much for the notorious Haitian appetite for violence , every culture has the violence it embraces ) .
Then Napoleon turned emperor , to make an anarchic revolution more orderly .
And profitable .
Slavery was re-imposed on islands like Hispaniola and Martinique .
Napoleon ’s treachery in imprisoning Toussaint L’Overture ( who had agreed to meet him under a flag of truce ) , was legendary , and intensified the West African ’s commitment to violent rebellion .
A large army ( many of these soldiers were Poles , not French , and many stayed ) was landed on the island , but illness decimated the troops and they finally surrendered on January 1 , 1804 .
Since then , the small island nation ’s fortunes have waxed and waned , often in tandem with American military occupation .
In this , her story is like many others , deeply saddening , and offering a glimpse into the “ dark side ” of the European Renaissance ( this is the marvelous title of Walter Mignolo ’s important book on the ambivalence of European Modernity in the Americas . )
In short , Haiti seems to stand as a dramatic and desperate item on the negative side of the Modern ledger .
If the revolutionary story of the Modern world is a story about individualism , about religion , about race and about rights , then it is hard to know how to tell those stories in Haiti .
What , then , can we do for Haiti ?
I can think of only one small , symbolic and unsatisfying thing .
We can resist the temptation to moralize her tragedy , resist the temptation to turn Haiti into a morality play .
It was Nietzsche who first warned us that such moralism is the real deal with the devil .
And that in making it , we only succeed in punishing ourselves .
After that , we can identify the aid agency in which we are prepared to place our trust , to get money and supplies to the long - suffering victims of this earthquake , as soon as possible .
Top international scientists have expressed shock at the suspension of a leading astronomer in South Africa this week .
The fallout has raised fears that the country could lose its bid to host one of the largest science projects on Earth .
South Africa ’s National Research Foundation ( NRF ) suspended Professor Phil Charles , director of the South African Astronomical Observatory ( SAAO ) , on Monday , apparently because he discussed with other scientists optimal sites for the headquarters of the world ’s biggest proposed radio telescope in prospect , the Square Kilometre Array ( SKA ) .
South Africa and Australia are both bidding to host the R20 - billion international SKA radio telescope project , which aims to construct a radio telescope with a collecting area of a million square metres .
The project will involve more than 34 institutions in 16 countries .
“ Firing such a respected and trusted senior astronomer seems a pretty dim thing to do , ” Andy Lawrence , professor of astronomy at the University of Edinburgh , wrote on his blog .
The online report of the authoritative science magazine , Nature , this week quoted several scientists ’ outrage over Charles ’s suspension .
Scientists now express fears that the embarrassing publicity could jeopardise South Africa ’s bid to host the SKA project .
But the NRF is playing down Charles ’s link to the SKA .
“ This matter is an internal matter between the NRF and one of its staff members at the SAAO and should thus not be improperly linked to the SKA bid , ” said Patrick Thompson , group executive for human resources at the NRF .
Charles ’s suspension “ broadly relates to respect for protocol and the handling of work - in - progress sensitive information ” , he said .
The astronomer is a key scientist in South Africa ’s bid to host the SKA project and for the development of South Africa ’s 80 - dish MeerKAT ( Karoo Array Telescope ) , which will serve as a forerunner to the SKA .
The trouble apparently started when Charles told peers that Observatory in Cape Town , near the city ’s universities , is his preferred site for the headquarters of MeerKAT and the SKA .
Because South Africa would need a steady supply of scientists for the SKA , Charles and other scientists believe its operational headquarters should be near the universities .
The Mail & Guardian understands that the NRF ’s preferred site is Ysterplaat , a South African Air Force base .
Five sites are up for discussion .
These are presented in a document commissioned by the NRF and prepared by Professor Krish Bharuth - Ram , titled “ A Decadal Strategy for Human Capacity Development in Astronomy and Astrophysics in South Africa ” .
The paper was completed last August , but circulated only at the end of January .
Scientists who spoke to the M&G called the document “ controversial ” and wondered why it was not circulated immediately .
It will be presented next week at an NRF workshop , where the sites are expected to be discussed .
Scientists the M&G spoke to expressed disgust at Charles ’s suspension , saying it manifests tensions between the administration of the NRF and scientists on the ground .
“ What are we allowed to discuss and not discuss ? ” one scientist asked .
“ Science should be open , not hidden behind a veil of secrecy . ”
But Thompson denied that there were any such tensions .
“ As a knowledge organisation [ such as the NRF ] , one should expect that there will always be debate and that the best ideas will prevail , ” he said .
The row comes in the same week that President Jacob Zuma told the African Union in Ethiopia that the SKA could prove Africa ’s leadership in science and innovation .
Charles , who holds the chair of astronomy at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom , was headhunted by the NRF and moved to South Africa in 2004 on a five - year contract .
The NRF renewed his contract last year until September 2011 .
The NRF ’s parent government body , the department of science and technology , has been quiet in the wake of the controversy , despite Minister Naledi Pandor ’s insistence that South Africa ’s ducks should be in a row when it comes to the SKA .
“ Australia is a competent competing bidder and I have to keep my finger on the pulse with this project , ” she said last weekend , before Charles ’s suspension was announced .
The department did not respond to the M&G ‘s questions .

The Baltic Sea is especially vulnerable to pollution The Russian military allegedly dumped nuclear waste into the Baltic Sea in the early 1990s , according to a report on Swedish television .
Radioactive material from a military base in Latvia is thought to have been thrown into Swedish waters .
For many the biggest shock is that the Swedish government may have known at the time and done nothing about it .
The partly enclosed Baltic Sea is known as one of the most polluted seas in the world .
But now it seems it was also used as a dumping ground for Russian nuclear waste and chemical weapons .
According to a report on Swedish television , Russian boats sailed out at night to dump barrels of radioactive material , from a military base in Latvia , into Swedish waters .
And even though the Swedish government at the time reportedly knew this , no action was taken to find the waste .
The current government in Stockholm now wants the politicians who were then in charge to explain why they did nothing to find the barrels .
The Baltic Sea is semi-enclosed , so it takes a long time to flush out toxins .
This makes it particularly vulnerable to pollution .
And after years of untreated waste from Russia 's cities and heavy industries , scientists say that the Baltic is in danger of becoming a dead sea .
Next week high - ranking politicians from those countries bordering the Baltic , including Russia , are due to attend a summit in Helsinki to discuss how to save it .
But if reports about Soviet nuclear waste being dumped prove true , then Russia will have even more accusations of pollution to answer .

The issue reignited speculation , common in the administration ’s early months , that Mr. Geithner and perhaps Lawrence H. Summers , the senior White House economic adviser , were not long for the Obama world given broad public perceptions that they remained too close to the financial industry .
But numerous administration officials said that both men had earned the trust and confidence of Mr. Obama , who believed they had not received credit for stabilizing a financial system that by all accounts was on the verge of collapse when the president took office .
His pique on that score came through in his televised interview with ABC News on Wednesday , after the loss in Massachusetts , even as Mr. Obama empathized with Americans ’ anger about the bailout effort , the Troubled Asset Relief Program , that he inherited from George W. Bush .
“ Now if I tell them , ‘ Well , it turns out that we will actually have gotten TARP paid back and that we ’re going to make sure that a fee ’s imposed on the big banks so that this thing will cost the taxpayers not a dime , ’ that ’s helpful , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ But it does n’t eliminate the sense that their voices are n’t heard and that institutions are betraying them . ”
To change that , he added , “ We ’re about to get into a big fight with the banks . ”
That fight is sure to continue testing Mr. Geithner , as well as Mr. Summers and lesser - known members of the economic team who are seen by others in the West Wing as politically tone - deaf .
Yet Mr. Geithner , in an interview , said he foresaw no problems .
“ Just because things seem populist does n’t mean they ’re not the right thing to do , ” he said .
The administration ’s new tack suggests just how much big banks have miscalculated Americans ’ intensified resentment against the bailout  anger stoked by persistent high unemployment , banks ’ stinginess in lending to small business and the revival of Wall Street ’s bonus culture .
They have become the perfect foil for the White House as it tries to lead the Democratic Party out of its post - Massachusetts morass  and to change the channel from the seemingly unending debate over health insurance .
As the White House hopes to define the fight , the enemy is not big government but big money .
Websites were shut down , public servants received threatening phone calls and pornography was plastered across Kevin Rudd 's home page in a major cyber protest against government plans to filter the internet .
The government 's Cyber Security Operations Centre discovered the attack was coming on February 5 but was unable to stop the parliament house website going offline and Prime Minister Rudd 's site becoming home to " Operation Titstorm " .
Internet protest group Anonymous , known for its regular attacks on Scientology websites , was behind the actions which were led by a so - called denial of service charge on www.aph.gov.au.
Just after 8 am ( AEDT ) on Wednesday the parliament 's website was hit by 7.5 million requests for communication per second , Parliamentary Services Secretary Alan Thompson told AAP .
" We had some advice in the lead - up to today there was going to be some cyber attack , " Mr Thompson said .
One would think that policymakers would treat the day before Christmas as sacrosanct , if not for the sake of their employees , but to avoid the endless conspiracy theories that naturally arise when you partake in activities that look like they are intended to fly under the radar .
Has US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner learned nothing in his long tenure serving Goldman Sachs the people of the United States of America ?
Ignoring the wisdom of the ages , Geithner made what appears to be unlimited funds available to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae on the day when most of the nation is more concerned about getting presents under the tree ( myself personally content that I can squeeze yet another year of magic under the Santa Claus myth ) than the policy machinations of Washington .
But do we really care ?
Is this really a new news , or just a matter of questionable timing ?
Would the same announcement today have raised the ire of the blogshpere ?
To get at this issue , we should back up to a New York Times article a few weeks back ( hat tip toDean Baker ) :
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which buy and resell mortgages , have used $ 112 billion — including $ 15 billion for Fannie in November — of a total $ 400 billion pledge from the Treasury .
Now , according to people close to the talks , officials are discussing the possibility of increasing that commitment , possibly to $ 400 billion for each company , by year - end , after which the Treasury would need Congressional approval to extend it .
Company and government officials declined to comment .
Apparently this little item was lost in the Christmas rush - seriously , could this even compare to the endless fascination with the status of holiday sales ?
The point is that hanging in the background was the likelihood that Mae and Mac were expecting some very , very bad fourth quarter numbers .
Indeed , despite the massive efforts to support the housing market , Fannie Mae reported today that serious delinquencies continue to climb at an alarming rate .
So , at second glance , Treasury 's Christmas Eve announcement looks somewhat less disconcerting .
The timing questionable , but the outcome expected .
But why the essentially unlimited access to funds ?
I think this is pretty straightforward - Geithner simply lifted illusion ( delusion ? ) that the GSEs were anything less than backed by the full faith and credit of the Uncle Sam .
Seriously , at this juncture who believes that GSE debt is any different than Treasury debt ?
Or that the US will not pump into any amount of dollars necessary to keep the GSEs afloat ?
That said , the Treasury 's press release was bereft of explanatory information , giving rise to a host of theories as chronicled by Calculated Risk .
In my mind , the most appealing of these explanations ( other than that stated above ) is the supposed intention to use the GSEs to absorb dysfunctional mortgages in an effort to revive floundering modification programs .
Why ?
Because , as structured , modifications just simply do n’t work in aggregate .
I have thought this from day one of the modification story .
And , frankly , I do n’t think I am particularly insightful on this point .
Seems obvious .
Suppose homeowner A is underwater on a mortgage costing $ 4,000 a month for a property that now has a rental equivalent of $ 2,000 .
How exactly does it help that homeowner to " modify " their mortgage to $ 3,000 a month ?
They are still underwater , and they will likely have to sacrifice any potential gains ( 10 - 20 years down the road ! ) .
The modification leaves you with the choice of being a virtual renter for $ 3,000 a month or an actual renter for $ 2,000 a month .
Moreover , what truly is better for the economy ?
To free up $ 2,000 in the household 's monthly budget via a balance sheet restructuring , or to weigh down the household balance sheet with an impossible debt burden ?
The Wall Street Journal recently printed a front page article on this topic that I thought was spot on :
Analysts at Deutsche Bank Securities expect 21 million U.S. households to end up owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth by the end of 2010 .
If one in five of those households defaults , the losses to banks and investors could exceed $ 400 billion .
As a proportion of the economy , that 's roughly equivalent to the losses suffered in the savings - and - loan debacle of the late 1980s and early 1990s .
The flip side of those losses , though , is massive debt relief that can help offset the pain of rising unemployment and put cash in consumers ' pockets .
For the 4.8 million U.S. households that data provider LPS Applied Analytics estimates have n't paid their mortgages in at least three months , the added cash flow could amount to about $ 5 billion a month -- an injection that in the long term could be worth more than the tax breaks in the Obama administration 's economic - stimulus package .
" It 's a stealth stimulus , " says Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics , a consulting firm specializing in real estate and the California economy .
" The quicker these people shed their debts , the faster the economy is going to heal and move forward again . "
As the stigma of abandoning a mortgage wanes , the Obama administration could face an uphill battle in its effort to keep people in their homes by pressuring banks to cut their mortgage payments .
Some analysts argue that 's not always the right approach , particularly if it prevents people from shedding onerous debts and starting afresh .
" The effect of these programs is often to lead homeowners to make decisions that are not in their economic best interests , " says Brent White , a law professor at the University of Arizona who has studied mortgage defaults .
The sorry truth is that many households underwater on their mortgages are likely better off defaulting ( this is not a suggestion to strategically default ; consult your attorney when contemplating that option ) , and so likely is the economy as a whole , than accepting a modification that does not involve a significant principle reduction .
The only people who do not recognize this are , sadly , policymakers , who have trouble comprehending the possibility of a bubble that led to prices far above ability to pay .
Such a delusion extended to the highest levels of the Fed .
Arguably , the push for modifications is simply more evidence that Washington is more concerned with the interests of Wall Street than Main Street .
Hence why the Treasury 's blanket coverage of the GSEs leads to speculation that the Administration intends to more aggressively use their portfolios to push for principle reductions .
Such reductions , obviously , actually help households , but at a cost to the taxpayers that leaves mortgage asset holders nearly whole .
Such reductions would also wipe away any remaining delusion that the trouble in housing is a liquidity issue rather than a insolvency issue .
To be sure , I would indeed not be surprised to see an enhanced modification effort via the GSE s that push greater costs onto the taxpayer , especially with respect to the mortgages still held by Mae and Mac .
But to dig deeper into the issue , I think the GSEs would need to aggressively purchase privately held mortgages with the potential for liquidation .
And here this paragraph in the Treasury release sticks out :
Treasury remains committed to the principle of reducing the retained portfolios .
To meet this goal , Treasury does not expect Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be active buyers to increase the size of their retained mortgage portfolios , but neither is it expected that active selling will be necessary to meet the required targets .
FHFA will continue to monitor and oversee the retained portfolio activities in a manner consistent with the FHFA 's responsibility as conservator and the requirements of the PSPAs .
So Mae and Mac are not required to sell part of their portfolio into a declining market ( which would exacerbate the loss to taxpayers ) , but nor would they be expected or really allowed to expand their portfolio to ease the process of modifications on the back of the taxpayer .
Moreover , even an effort to expand modifications does not appear to be within the FHFA 's conservator responsibilities .
Which would , if I am reading this right , suggest that while there are plenty of reasons to believe that the modification program is fundamentally a failure , Treasury 's Christmas Eve announcement is not a backdoor effort to expand the socialization of mortgage losses .
Yet .
In short , there are plenty of ulterior motives for Treasury 's expansion of the Mae and Mac bailouts .
My favorite is the desire to expand the ability of the GSEs to absorb principle reductions for housing modifications .
But the simplest explanation is likely the correct one - the financial damage to the GSEs continues virtually unabated , and the Treasury simply needs to make explicit what was implicit : Mae and Mac are backed by the US government 's full faith and credit , regardless of the level of losses in those institutions .
I do n't think this is really an expansion of the bailout ; more just a confirmation of my prior beliefs .

If there is life anywhere else in the Universe , it is very likely that it is based on the carbon molecule , just as it is on Earth .
This theory makes sense because the possible compounds of carbon out number the compounds of all the other elements put together , ten times over .
Carbon atoms seem able to join together to form stable molecules almost regardless of the number of carbon atoms involved .
As a result of this property , a virtually endless variety of molecular ‘ backbones ’ can be constructed from carbon .
Giant molecules like the ones which combine to make up natural proteins and man-made plastics , are based on it .
Very few known elements can form such large molecules and those that can , such as sulfur , are more restricted in the range of other elements with which they will combine .
Each carbon atom can link with up to four other atoms , including other carbon atoms .
So the number of possible compounds which can be made from carbon escalates rapidly as the number of carbon atoms in a molecule increases .
Try some basic mathematics here : five carbon molecules can attract twenty more , which can attract eighty , and so on .
Propane , which is used as bottled gas , has the chemical formula CH3CH2CH3 which shows that each molecule contains three carbon and eight hydrogen atoms .
Butane C4H10 is a similar gas which has four carbon atoms and ten hydrogen .
The four atoms can be arranged in a single chain or with the fourth carbon forming a branch in the middle .
These different structures give rise to two compounds which are known as isomers and these have different properties .
Here , the straight chain of atoms would be normal butane and the other would be isobutane .
As the number of carbon atoms in a molecule increases , more and more forms of the same molecule are possible .
By the time a molecule has gathered up 40 carbon atoms there are 62.5 million million possibilities , giving a vast range of possible compounds , many of which are still unknown to science .
This relativly easy chemistry lesson demonstrates how carbon can combine with so many other elements to come up with almost infinite possibilities .
Carbon is the most versatile element in the Universe , so , by the law of averages , it is likely that life anywhere else will be based on the carbon atom .
Science has not yet investigated all the possibilities that carbon offers and has no idea what might be possible .
With so many millions of untested and uninvestigated options , chemistry is indeed a fascinating subject and may some day hold the key to understanding life elsewhere in the Universe .
Recently one of my Facebook statuses prompted another debate wherein one of the Christian participants made the argument that the good of Christianity outweighs the bad in reference to the fact that I am so passionate about fighting religion in general .
I want to explore that idea from a reasoned and historical perspective as this discussion always leads to a debate about the origin of morality and supposed objective morality standards .
Of course I find that this argument is old and played out since I ’ve only dealt with it six times now on this blog , but I figure why not try one more time … seeing as I have n’t updated in over 30 days now .
One of the Goods of Christianity , as pointed out by my friendly opponent is the morality that it provides .
Somehow people still believe that the Bible has a corner on the market of reasonable laws to follow in that the Ten Commandments tell us not to Steal , Lie , Murder , or commit Adultery ( unless of course , YHVH says that it ’s ok to do so … then it ’s cool ) .
For some reason those same people forget that those same laws , among others , predate Moses by means of the Code of Hammurabi and the Code of Ur - Nammu .
Interestingly enough the Code of Hammurabi was also handed down to it ’s recipient directly from a deity .
These facts are convenient to forget and they fly in the face of the argument that morality comes from their “ one true ” god .
For some reason most of the god ’s that man has had have had a similar moral compass despite those gods being devils from the Biblical perspective .
Moral relativity is also consistently used as an argument against the idea that morality is impossible with a deity to provide the standard .
The problem with this argument is that even if moral relativity IS true it rarely deviates to the extent of some massive change in the morals of the populous .
When it does it is generally the religious population that makes the largest change .
Case in point :
In 2003 it was the Christian right that most loudly supported the Bush Administrations plan to invade Iraq , despite there being no connection between Hussein and 9/11 nor any implied threat from him .
Christians all over the South and the rest of America came together over this and supported the killing of over 50,000 7000 innocent civilians during the initial bombing of Baghdad .
Even today the Christians are the ones supporting indiscriminate bombing in Pakistan … something I call murder .
These people will go so far as to justify these actions with God .
What is most interesting about this example is that the largest group of dissenters are the non-religious or non-christian .
My morals have n’t been manipulated by god , church , or bad information … to me , it ’s still wrong to kill an innocent person .
Just a thought …
Discussion topic :
What are some other examples of the non-religious having superior morals ?
In the tumultuous days leading up to the Pakistan Army ’s ground offensive in the tribal area of South Waziristan , which began on October 17th , the Pakistani Taliban attacked what should have been some of the country ’s best - guarded targets .
In the most brazen strike , ten gunmen penetrated the Army ’s main headquarters , in Rawalpindi , instigating a twenty - two - hour standoff that left twenty - three dead and the military thoroughly embarrassed .
The terrorists had been dressed in Army uniforms .
There were also attacks on police installations in Peshawar and Lahore , and , once the offensive began , an Army general was shot dead by gunmen on motorcycles on the streets of Islamabad , the capital .
The assassins clearly had advance knowledge of the general ’s route , indicating that they had contacts and allies inside the security forces .
Pakistan has been a nuclear power for two decades , and has an estimated eighty to a hundred warheads , scattered in facilities around the country .
The success of the latest attacks raised an obvious question :
Are the bombs safe ?
Asked this question the day after the Rawalpindi raid , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said , “ We have confidence in the Pakistani government and the military ’s control over nuclear weapons . ”
Clinton — whose own visit to Pakistan , two weeks later , would be disrupted by more terrorist bombs — added that , despite the attacks by the Taliban , “ we see no evidence that they are going to take over the state . ”
Clinton ’s words sounded reassuring , and several current and former officials also said in interviews that the Pakistan Army was in full control of the nuclear arsenal .
But the Taliban overrunning Islamabad is not the only , or even the greatest , concern .
The principal fear is mutiny — that extremists inside the Pakistani military might stage a coup , take control of some nuclear assets , or even divert a warhead .
On April 29th , President Obama was asked at a news conference whether he could reassure the American people that Pakistan ’s nuclear arsenal could be kept away from terrorists .
Obama ’s answer remains the clearest delineation of the Administration ’s public posture .
He was , he said , “ gravely concerned ” about the fragility of the civilian government of President Asif Ali Zardari .
“ Their biggest threat right now comes internally , ” Obama said .
“ We have huge . . . national - security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable and that you do n’t end up having a nuclear - armed militant state . ”
The United States , he said , could “ make sure that Pakistan ’s nuclear arsenal is secure — primarily , initially , because the Pakistan Army , I think , recognizes the hazards of those weapons ’ falling into the wrong hands . ”
The questioner , Chuck Todd , of NBC , began asking whether the American military could , if necessary , move in and secure Pakistan ’s bombs .
Obama did not let Todd finish .
“ I ’m not going to engage in hypotheticals of that sort , ” he said .
“ I feel confident that the nuclear arsenal will remain out of militant hands .
O.K. ? ”
Obama did not say so , but current and former officials said in interviews in Washington and Pakistan that his Administration has been negotiating highly sensitive understandings with the Pakistani military .
These would allow specially trained American units to provide added security for the Pakistani arsenal in case of a crisis .
At the same time , the Pakistani military would be given money to equip and train Pakistani soldiers and to improve their housing and facilities — goals that General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , the chief of the Pakistan Army , has long desired .
In June , Congress approved a four - hundred - million - dollar request for what the Administration called the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund , providing immediate assistance to the Pakistan Army for equipment , training , and “ renovation and construction . ”
The secrecy surrounding the understandings was important because there is growing antipathy toward America in Pakistan , as well as a history of distrust .
Many Pakistanis believe that America ’s true goal is not to keep their weapons safe but to diminish or destroy the Pakistani nuclear complex .
The arsenal is a source of great pride among Pakistanis , who view the weapons as symbols of their nation ’s status and as an essential deterrent against an attack by India .
( India ’s first nuclear test took place in 1974 , Pakistan ’s in 1998 . )
A senior Pakistani official who has close ties to Zardari exploded with anger during an interview when the subject turned to the American demands for more information about the arsenal .
After the September 11th attacks , he said , there had been an understanding between the Bush Administration and then President Pervez Musharraf “ over what Pakistan had and did not have . ”
Today , he said , “ you ’d like control of our day - to - day deployment .
But why should we give it to you ?
Even if there was a military coup d’état in Pakistan , no one is going to give up total control of our nuclear weapons .
Never .
Why are you not afraid of India ’s nuclear weapons ? ” the official asked .
“ Because India is your friend , and the longtime policies of America and India converge .
Between you and the Indians , you will fuck us in every way .
The truth is that our weapons are less of a problem for the Obama Administration than finding a respectable way out of Afghanistan . ”
The ongoing consultation on nuclear security between Washington and Islamabad intensified after the announcement in March of President Obama ’s so - called Af - Pak policy , which called upon the Pakistan Army to take more aggressive action against Taliban enclaves inside Pakistan .
I was told that the understandings on nuclear coöperation benefitted from the increasingly close relationship between Admiral Michael Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and General Kayani , his counterpart , although the C.I.A. and the Departments of Defense , State , and Energy have also been involved .
( All three departments declined to comment for this article .
The national - security council and the C.I.A. denied that there were any agreements in place . )
In response to a series of questions , Admiral Mullen acknowledged that he and Kayani were , in his spokesman ’s words , “ very close . ”
The spokesman said that Mullen is deeply involved in day - to - day Pakistani developments and “ is almost an action officer for all things Pakistan . ”
But he denied that he and Kayani , or their staffs , had reached an understanding about the availability of American forces in case of mutiny or a terrorist threat to a nuclear facility .
“ To my knowledge , we have no military units , special forces or otherwise , involved in such an assignment , ” Mullen said through his spokesman .
The spokesman added that Mullen had not seen any evidence of growing fundamentalism inside the Pakistani military .
In a news conference on May 4th , however , Mullen responded to a query about growing radicalism in Pakistan by saying that “ what has clearly happened over the [ past ] twelve months is the continual decline , gradual decline , in security . ”
The Admiral also spoke openly about the increased coöperation on nuclear security between the United States and Pakistan : “ I know what we ’ve done over the last three years , specifically to both invest , assist , and I ’ve watched them improve their security fairly dramatically .
. . .
I ’ve looked at this , you know , as hard as I can , over a period of time . ”
Seventeen days later , he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , “ We have invested a significant amount of resources through the Department of Energy in the last several years ” to help Pakistan improve the controls on its arsenal .
“ They still have to improve them , ” he said .
In interviews in Pakistan , I obtained confirmation that there were continuing conversations with the United States on nuclear - security plans — as well as evidence that the Pakistani leadership put much less weight on them than the Americans did .
In some cases , Pakistani officials spoke of the talks principally as a means of placating anxious American politicians .
“ You needed it , ” a senior Pakistani official , who said that he had been briefed on the nuclear issue , told me .
His tone was caustic .
“ We have twenty thousand people working in the nuclear - weapons industry in Pakistan , and here is this American view that Pakistan is bound to fail . ”
The official added , “ The Americans are saying , ‘ We want to help protect your weapons . ’
We say , ‘ Fine .
Tell us what you can do for us . ’
It ’s part of a quid pro quo .
You say , also , ‘ Come clean on the nuclear program and we ’ll insure that India does n’t put pressure on it . ’
So we say , ‘ O.K . ’ ”
But , the Pakistani official said , “ both sides are lying to each other . ”
The information that the Pakistanis handed over was not as complete as the Americans believed .
“ We have n’t told you anything that you do n’t know , ” he said .
The Americans did n’t realize that Pakistan would never cede control of its arsenal : “ If you try to take the weapons away , you will fail . ”
High - level coöperation between Islamabad and Washington on the Pakistani nuclear arsenal began at least eight years ago .
Former President Musharraf , when I interviewed him in London recently , acknowledged that his government had held extensive discussions with the Bush Administration after the September 11th attacks , and had given State Department nonproliferation experts insight into the command and control of the Pakistani arsenal and its on - site safety and security procedures .
Musharraf also confirmed that Pakistan had constructed a huge tunnel system for the transport and storage of nuclear weaponry .
“ The tunnels are so deep that a nuclear attack will not touch them , ” Musharraf told me , with obvious pride .
The tunnels would make it impossible for the American intelligence community — “ Big Uncle , ” as a Pakistani nuclear - weapons expert called it — to monitor the movements of nuclear components by satellite .
Safeguards have been built into the system .
Pakistani nuclear doctrine calls for the warheads ( containing an enriched radioactive core ) and their triggers ( sophisticated devices containing highly explosive lenses , detonators , and krytrons ) to be stored separately from each other and from their delivery devices ( missiles or aircraft ) .
The goal is to insure that no one can launch a warhead — in the heat of a showdown with India , for example — without pausing to put it together .
Final authority to order a nuclear strike requires consensus within Pakistan ’s ten-member National Command Authority , with the chairman — by statute , President Zardari — casting the deciding vote .
But the safeguards meant to keep a confrontation with India from escalating too quickly could make the arsenal more vulnerable to terrorists .
Nuclear - security experts have war - gamed the process and concluded that the triggers and other elements are most exposed when they are being moved and reassembled — at those moments there would be fewer barriers between an outside group and the bomb .
A consultant to the intelligence community said that in one war - gamed scenario disaffected members of the Pakistani military could instigate a terrorist attack inside India , and that the ensuing crisis would give them “ a chance to pick up bombs and triggers — in the name of protecting the assets from extremists . ”
The triggers are a key element in American contingency plans .
An American former senior intelligence official said that a team that has trained for years to remove or dismantle parts of the Pakistani arsenal has now been augmented by a unit of the Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) , the élite counterterrorism group .
He added that the unit , which had earlier focussed on the warheads ’ cores , has begun to concentrate on evacuating the triggers , which have no radioactive material and are thus much easier to handle .
“ The Pakistanis gave us a virtual look at the number of warheads , some of their locations , and their command - and - control system , ” the former senior intelligence official told me .
“ We saw their target list and their mobilization plans .
We got their security plans , so we could augment them in case of a breach of security , ” he said .
“ We ’re there to help the Pakistanis , but we ’re also there to extend our own axis of security to their nuclear stockpile . ”
The detailed American planning even includes an estimate of how many nuclear triggers could be placed inside a C - 17 cargo plane , the former official said , and where the triggers could be sequestered .
Admiral Mullen , asked about increased American insight into the arsenal , said , through his spokesman , “ I am not aware of our receipt of any such information . ”
( A senior military officer added that the information , if it had been conveyed , would most likely “ have gone to another government agency . ” )
A judge has issued a $ 50 K arrest warrant for Cole White , a 24 - year - old Redwood City man suspected of assaulting a gay man at a the gay - friendly Santa Cruz nightclub Blue Lagoon , the Santa Cruz Sentinel reports :
The victim said White called him a gay slur outside the club .
He said he saw White at the bar a few minutes later and turned to ask him if he was the man who had just verbally accosted him on the sidewalk .
Instead of answering , White allegedly punched the victim in the face .
The victim said he was knocked to the ground and beaten for 10 - 15 seconds before someone pulled him off the floor and rushed him outside .
Blue Lagoon manager Fred Friedman said the altercation actually began with bumping and name - calling inside the club , then went outside .
“ This
gentleman and the other people decided to handle it themselves out on
the street , ” said Friedman , who was working Saturday night and early
Sunday .
Friedman said everyone involved came back in the bar , but were thrown out by security staff before police arrived .
The victim said he snapped a
cell phone photo of the man he said attacked him , something police
later used to identify White , Friend said .
But outside the bar in the
moments after the fight , 23 - year - old David Douglas Cameron allegedly
grabbed the cell phone and ran toward the levee , according to police .
The victim chased after him until police took up the pursuit and
apprehended Cameron , who police said is a friend of White’s .
Cameron
was arrested on suspicion of robbery .
9 July 2009
SARTEANO , ITALY — University of Texas at Austin graduate student Guillermo A. Blanc is talking dissection .
But he ’s not a biologist — he ’s an astronomer .
Blanc is using a new instrument at the university ’s McDonald Observatory to dissect nearby galaxies to learn how stars form , and in the process , generating a flood of new information that will benefit other scientists ’ work .
Blanc is presenting his first results this week at an international conference called “ SFR@50 : Filling the Cosmos with Stars ” in Sarteano , Italy .
The conference celebrates the 50th anniversary of a landmark study of the star formation rate ( SFR ) in galaxies .
Blanc ’s research will set a new landmark in this arena , with a new way to study star formation in nearby galaxies using the best instrument in the world for these kind of studies .
Blanc is mapping star formation in 30 nearby spiral galaxies in amazing detail using the VIRUS - P instrument on McDonald Observatory ’s 2.7 - meter Harlan J. Smith Telescope .
His project is called VENGA , the VIRUS - P Exploration of Nearby Galaxies .
“ We are going to dissect these galaxies in every possible way , ” he says .
“ The tendency for galaxy studies today is to look at galaxies farther away , and farther back in time .
But in order to understand those , you really need to first understand galaxies in detail .
The best way to do that is to look at nearby galaxies .
It allows you to interpret the data on distant galaxies . ”
His first VENGA target is the famous Whirlpool Galaxy , and he ’s presenting those results in Italy this week .
The study is helping to determine the drivers for star formation in galaxies .
Previous studies disagreed about the role played by molecular gas at setting the rate at which stars form .
Blanc ’s study , done in collaboration with Texas astronomers Amanda Heiderman , Karl Gebhardt , Neal Evans , and Joshua Adams , shows that the amount of molecular gas is the key factor determining how many stars are formed .
“ We confirm that the star formation rate correlates very well with the amount of molecular gas present in different regions inside galaxies .
These two quantities are expected to be correlated since this is gas in giant molecular clouds , which are the birth places of stars .
These new type of observations allow us not only to observe this correlation , but also to measure precisely how these two quantities relate to each other , ” he says .
He also found that the efficiency of star formation in this galaxy is very low — only one percent of the available gas is transformed into stars in a characteristic time .
Additionally , Blanc ’s studies reveal that for a given amount of gas , the rate of star formation can vary by a factor of three , meaning there might be other important drivers of star formation .
Blanc plans to investigate these in future studies .
It ’s the special design of the VIRUS - P instrument that makes Blanc ’s studies of star formation new and exciting .
Like all spectrographs , VIRUS - P takes the light from astronomical objects and breaks it down into its component wavelengths , resulting in an information - rich spectrum that astronomers can decode to learn an astronomical object ’s motion , composition , temperature , and more .
But this spectrograph is different .
Instead of taking the spectrum of a single point on the sky , it takes lots of spectra of lots of areas at one time .
It ’s what is called an “ integral field unit ” ( IFU ) spectrograph .
VIRUS -P has the largest field of view of any IFU spectrograph in the world ( 2.9 square arcminutes ) , several times larger than the previous record holder .
For each of its 30 galaxies , VENGA will obtain spectra at every point in the galaxy , from the center to the most outlying regions of the galactic disk .
With VIRUS - P’s array of 246 optical fibers , the speed and direction of motion of both stars and gas at 246 different points inside the galaxy , as well as many other quantities like the star formation rate , the amount of light extinction due to dust , and the chemical composition of gas and stars , can be measured simultaneously in a single telescope pointing .
The instrument is “ ideal for studying nearby galaxies , ” Blanc says .
“ These galaxies are so nearby they are huge on the sky , so this is the most efficient instrument there is to study them , due to its large fibers and large field of view . ”
Star formation rates have been studied with spectroscopy before , Blanc says , but “ but it was n’t possible to do it throughout a whole galaxy , much less 30 galaxies , in an efficient way . ”
When the survey is completed , the VENGA team will have mapped 30 nearby spiral galaxies with a wide range of shapes .
Some have large central bulges of stars , others almost none .
Some have a bar running through the center ; others do n’t .
The galaxies also have different levels of star formation activity .
All of this data will be of interest to many different astronomers , and they plan to make it freely available .
“ When you point a spectrograph at a galaxy and you get every region of the galaxy and at a large wavelength range , you get a lot of information and it can be used for a lot of different science projects , ” Blanc says .
The VENGA team is composed of a large group of astronomers from The University of Texas at Austin and Germany ’s Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics .
The data will help in astronomers Niv Drory , Maximilian Fabricius , and David Fisher 's studies of the different types of galactic bulges and the evolutionary paths galaxies took to form them .
It will also be of great use to Texas astronomers Shardha Jogee , Irina Marinova , and Tim Weinzirl in their studies of the chemical compositions of galaxies ’ bulges versus that of their disks , and the role that galactic bars have in driving gas toward the centers of galaxies .
These latter studies aim to determine the degree to which internal processes and galactic mergers are responsible for building up a galaxy ’s central bulge .
The VENGA data also will allow Dutch astronomer Remco van den Bosch to study the structure of the dark matter halos in which these galaxies are thought to be embedded .
VIRUS -P is the prototype for a forthcoming larger spectrograph that will be built at The University of Texas to carry out the Hobby - Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment .
This larger spectrograph will contain 150 copies of the prototype , each with its 246 optical fibers , for a total of 36,900 optical fibers taking spectra across the sky simultaneously .
The instrument ’s name , VIRUS , comes from the fact that it contains multiple copies of a single instrument : the Visible Integral - field Replicable Unit Spectrograph .

Ever bought anything from Devil Mountain Software ?
Probably not .
But you may have come across Craig Barth ( though not , until this post , on the Guardian ) as the " chief technology officer " of that company , which said it offered software that would analyse the performance of your computer when running Windows .
Thing is , Craig Barth does n't exist .
He was in fact Randall C Kennedy , who blogged about .. um , Windows performance .. for the news technology site InfoWorld , part of the IDG group .
According to Gregg Keizer of another IDG publication , ComputerWorld ,
" Devil Mountain 's data , derived from a network of PCs whose owners have voluntarily downloaded and installed a stripped version of the software the company has sold to financial service firms , Wall Street traders and government agencies , has provided some interesting insights into PC use and behavior : Internet Explorer is more popular than most believed , or most recently , that Windows 7 machines are twice as likely as XP systems to run low of memory .
Barth 's data was unique : Microsoft rarely divulges details of the telemetric monitoring it does on Windows PCs .
Microsoft declined to comment or to make someone from their Windows or telemetry teams available for an interview , for example , to respond to the memory claims . "
But over at ZDNet , some of the experts did n't really trust what was coming out of Barth , or Devil Mountain Software .
So they did some digging .
And some more .
And it turned out that it was those little web footprints that really tripped Kennedy / Barth up :
" The current XPNet.com design debuted in early 2007 and was captured by Archive.org on April 30 , 2007 .
It does not now and never has contained any reference to either Kennedy or " Craig Barth . "
By September 2007 , Kennedy was using the page to publicize content he had posted on his new blog .
Links from Xpnet.com at that time went to an early version of the Blogger - hosted exo.blog .
By combing through those posts using the Wayback Machine , we were able to determine that the Research Staff profile originally belonged to Kennedy .
Some posts written in 2007 on that blog contained the Randall C. Kennedy by - line .
All of those posts were later changed so that the by - line was " Research Staff . "
" Kennedy was more careful after 2007 not to allow his identity to leak into the exo. blog site , but on at least two occasions — in November 2007 and September 2008 — he slipped up by posting graphics to Blogger using the wrong login .
Those graphics were uploaded to Google 's image servers and are tagged with the ID rkennedy01 ca . "
They also found that the " Sentinel " software offered by Devil Mountain Software was n't as secure as it claimed and that the data from individually identified machines could be inspected .
That 's quite scary - especially as its Ts&Cs said that " Performance data will be shared in aggregate only and never identified as linked to your individual account . "
And besides that , is the company 's software really used by big Wall Street firms to analyse Windows performance ?
It seems unlikely - though that 's yet to be refuted by ZDNet .
( Await an update ... )
So all the pieces fell into place : Barth and Kennedy were the same person , and Windows Sentinel ( as InfoWorld was redistributing it ) did n't quite do what it said on the tin .
ZDNet told InfoWorld last week .
So all those things that Keizer said about the company above - the interesting findings and so on - should be discounted .
You can't rely on them .
Seems that Barth / Kennedy could n't quite resist hanging on to his alter ego , though .
As Keizer recounts :
" on Friday , after I confronted Barth with evidence that linked him to Kennedy -- I did n't yet know they were one and the same -- he assured me that although the two had worked together in the past , and in fact , now worked together at Devil Mountain , any allegations that he and Kennedy were the same person were ridiculous .
Two hours later , I received an e-mail from Kennedy , who I 'd e-mailed separately .
" " Time to level with you , " Kennedy wrote .
" The individual Craig Barth does n't exist .
It 's a pseudonym I created a decade ago while writing news copy for Windows NT Magazine .
I resurrected it a few years back in an effort to separate my sometimes controversial editorial contributions to InfoWorld from the hard research content I was developing as part of Devil Mountain Software . "
Aaaand - that 's him out of the door of InfoWorld .
A terse blogpost said that Kennedy is gone .
But has his content gone ?
" Over the past 10 years , Kennedy has contributed valuable information on Windows performance and other technical issues to InfoWorld and its readers -- insight and analysis we still believe to be accurate and reliable . "
Hmm .
It seems that there are a few results on InfoWorld for Craig Barth ( at the time of this posting , five including the " get out of here " posting ) .
No doubt they 'll get wiped out soon .
So we 'll only have the Wayback Machine to rely on .
George Orwell would laugh .
So fess up : have you come across Devil Mountain Software , or used Windows Sentinel via InfoWorld ?
A glimmer of hope emerged from the horror of the Haiti earthquake today as a two - year - old boy was pulled alive from his collapsed home .
Dirty and teary - eyed , Redjeson Hausteen Claude appeared to smile at his ecstatic mother as he was carried from the rubble by a Spanish rescue team .
But elsewhere there was little hope .
Another child , nine - year - old Haryssa Keem Clerge , had been trapped inside a basement and had been heard begging to be rescued as neighbours clawed at the rubble of one of hundreds of toppled structures teetering on the side of a ravine .
Just hours later her lifeless body was finally pulled from the mass of concrete and twisted metal .
Wrapped in a green bath towel , it was placed inside a loose desk drawer .
With nowhere to take it , the body was then left on the hood of a battered Isuzu Trooper .
" There are no police , no anybody , " said the child 's despairing godmother , Kettely Clerge .
A day earlier , the little girl 's mother , Lauranie Jean , was pulled from the rubble of the same house .
She lay moaning inside a tent Thursday as volunteers rubbed ointment into open wounds on her sides .
The death toll from the devastating earthquake in Haiti may be as high as 50,000 to 100,000 people , the Pan American Health Organization said on Friday .
Jon Andrus of PAHO , the Americas arm of the World Health organization , told a news briefing : " A variety of sources are estimating the numbers ( at ) between 50,000 and 100,000 . "
Meanwhile aid workers hoping to distribute food , water and other supplies to a shattered Port - au - Prince are warning their efforts may need more security today as Haitians grow increasingly desperate and impatient for help .
Hundreds of US paratroopers arrived overnight to back up the relief effort .
Hard - pressed government workers , meanwhile , were burying thousands of bodies in mass graves .
The Red Cross estimates 45,000 to 50,000 people were killed in Tuesday 's cataclysmic earthquake .
More and more today , the focus fell on the daunting challenge of getting food and water to millions of survivors .
United Nations peacekeepers patrolling the capital said people 's anger is rising that aid has n't been distributed quickly , and the Brazilian military warned aid convoys to add security to guard against looting .
" Unfortunately , they 're slowly getting more angry and impatient , " said David Wimhurst , spokesman for the Brazilian - commanded UN peacekeeping mission .
" I fear , we 're all aware that the situation is getting more tense as the poorest people who need so much are waiting for deliveries .
I think tempers might be frayed . "
The UN World Food Programme reported today that its warehouses in the Haitian capital had been looted since the devastating quake .
It later announced that most of the stocks taken from the four warehouses had been recovered .
A spokeswoman for the Rome - based agency , Emilia Casella , noted that regular food stores in the city also had been emptied by looters .
Casella said the WFP was preparing shipments of enough ready - to - eat meals to feed two million Haitians for a month .
The UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon said today he would soon travel to Haiti " both to show solidarity with the people of Haiti and our UN staff and to assess the situation for myself " .
The latest confirmed death toll among UN personnel in Haiti is 37 , with around 330 UN personnel missing or unaccounted for out of roughly 12,000 in Haiti .
Ban said the United Nations was focusing on more than its own personnel and was trying to coordinate rescue efforts from the Port - au - Prince airport .
More than 300 troops of the US 82nd Airborne Division arrived at the Port au Prince airport overnight and others have arrived in nearby waters on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson , Lt. Gen .
Ken Keen told ABC's " Good Morning America . "
" We have much more support on the way .
Our priority is getting relief out to the needy people , " he said .
About 5,500 US soldiers and Marines are expected to be in Haiti by Monday .
Their efforts will include providing security , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
Hundreds of bodies were stacked outside the city morgue , and limbs of the dead protruded from the rubble of crushed schools and homes .
A few workers were able to free people who had been trapped under the rubble for days , including a New Jersey woman , Sarla Chand , freed by French firefighters yesterday from the collapsed Montana Hotel .
But others attended to the grim task of using bulldozers to transport loads of bodies .
Haitian President Rene Preval told The Miami Herald that over a 20 - hour period government crews had removed 7,000 corpses from the streets and morgues and buried them in mass graves .
For the long - suffering people of Haiti , the western hemisphere 's poorest nation , shock was giving way to despair .
" We need food .
The people are suffering .
My neighbours and friends are suffering , " said Sylvain Angerlotte , 22 .
" We do n't have money .
We do n't have nothing to eat .
We need pure water . "
From Europe , Asia and the Americas , more than 20 governments , the UN and private aid groups were sending plane loads of high - energy biscuits and other food , tons of water , tents , blankets , water - purification gear , heavy equipment for removing debris , helicopters and other transport .
Hundreds of search - and - rescue , medical and other specialists also headed to Haiti .
The WFP began organising distribution centres for food and water yesterday , said Kim Bolduc , acting chief of the large UN. mission in this desperately poor country .
She said that " the risk of having social unrest very soon " made it important to move quickly .
Governments and government agencies have pledged about $ 400 m worth of aid , including $ 100 m from the United States .
But into the third day following the 7.0 - magnitude quake , the global helping hand was slowed by a damaged seaport and an airport that turned away civilian aid planes for eight hours yesterday because of a lack of space and fuel .
Aid workers have been blocked by debris on inadequate roads and by survivors gathered in the open out of fear of aftershocks and re-entering unstable buildings .
" The physical destruction is so great that physically getting from point A to B with the supplies is not an easy task , " Casella , the WFP spokeswoman in Geneva , said at a news conference .
Across the sprawling , hilly city , people milled about in open areas , hopeful for help , sometimes setting up camps amid piles of salvaged goods , including food scavenged from the rubble .
Small groups could be seen burying dead by roadsides .
Other dust - covered bodies were being dragged down streets , toward hospitals where relatives hoped to leave them .
Countless dead remained unburied , some in piles .
Outside one pharmacy , the body of a woman was covered by a sheet , a small bundle atop her , a tiny foot poking from its covering .
Aid worker Fevil Dubien said some people were almost fighting over the water he distributed from a truck in a northern Port - au - Prince neighbourhood .
Elsewhere , about 50 Haitians yearning for food and water rushed toward two employees wearing " Food For The Poor " T - shirts as they entered the international agency 's damaged building .
" We heard a commotion at the door , knocking at it , trying to get in , " said project manager Liony Batista .
" ' What 's going on ?
Are you giving us some food ? '
We said , ' Uh - oh . '
You never know when people are going over the edge . "
Batista said he and others tried to calm the crowd , which eventually dispersed after being told food had n't yet arrived .
" We 're not trying to run away from what we do , " Batista said , adding that coordinating aid has been a challenge .
" People looked desperate , people looked hungry , people looked lost . "
Engineers from the UN mission have begun clearing some main roads , and law - and - order duties have fallen completely to the mission 's 3,000 international troops and police .
Wimhurst , the mission spokesman , said Haitian police " are not visible at all , " no doubt because many had to deal with lost homes and family members .
The first US military units to arrive took on a coordinating role at the airport .
Batista , the Food For The Poor project manager , went back to the Dominican Republic late yesterday and awaited the arrival of 100 shipping containers loaded with rice , canned goods and building supplies .
After ten years like these , the remaining 990 in this millennium have gotta be at least a little less goofy , right ?
If ever a decade began dumb , it was this one . *
When clocks struck midnight on January 1st and the dreaded Y2 K bug turned out to be nothing but a mild irritant , it proved once again that the experts often do n’t know what the heck they ’re talking about .
Which was a relief–and a fitting way to kick off the technological era we ’ve lived in ever since .
Yes , it ’s been an amazing time .
But it ’s also seen more than its share of misbegotten decisions , bizarre dramas , pointless hype , and lackluster products and technologies –often involving the same people and companies responsible for all the amazing stuff .
So–with a respectful tip of the Technologizer hat to Business 2.0 and Fortune ’s 101 Dumbest Moments in Business and , of course , to Esquire ’s Dubious Achievement Awards –let ’s recap , shall we ?
* Yes , we ’re aware that the decade did n’t really start until January 1st , 2001 , and does n’t end until December 31st , 2010 .
Shhhhh .
2000
1 . Well , at least I was n’t killed and eaten by the roving hordes of homeless yuppies .
Were you ?
Whouda thunk it ?
It turns out that the world has addressed the Y2 K problem remarkably well .
Those who predicted widespread starvation , utility failures , medical emergencies , and financial catastrophy probably feel a tad sheepish .
And / or disappointed .
2 . And it only took them a decade to undo it .
AOL announces that it ’s agreed to buy Time Warner on January 10th , a media megamerger that creates an Internet content juggernaut that never quite gels .
$ 260 billion of the combined companies ’ $ 300 billion market cap dwindles away over the next decade before Time Warner rids itself of a vastly less important AOL .
3 . Hey , Robinson Crusoe was lonely , too .
On January 19th , top - secret startup Transmeta says it ’s shaking up the chip world with its power - efficient Crusoe processor .
The CPU ’s performance disappoints , Intel cooks up low - power technology of its own , and Transmeta faces delisting from Nasdaq before selling out to a company which then goes out of business .
4 . Not the first press release full of fiction , and not the last .
Press -release service Internet
Wire is hoaxed by a former employee / community college student who uses it to distribute a fake release saying electronics firm Emulex is restating its earnings .
The company loses $ 2.5 billion of value and the student pockets $ 250,000 by shorting its stock before being arrested .
5 . The “ Me ” is short for Mediocre .
Or maybe Meh .
On September 14th , Microsoft releases Windows Millennium Edition ( aka Windows Me ) .
A follow - up to the popular Windows 98 SE and the last gasp of the rickety Windows 9.x platform , the slow and buggy
Me goes on to earn the distinction of having the ugliest reputation of any pre-Vista version of Windows .
6. Insert your own Shatner joke here .
An affiliate of name - your - own - price travel site Priceline shutters the dreadful Priceline WebHouse Club .
The shopping service let you bid on groceries , and was a swell idea except for the part about prices sometimes being higher than if you ’d just strolled into the supermarket , and the no - refunds - even - if - they - don ’t - even - have - the - product - you - won policy .
7. Audrey heartburn .
On October 17th , networking kingpin 3Com unveils Audrey , a $ 500 touchscreen “ computing appliance ” that does battle with rivals such as the I - Opener and Virgin WebPlayer for a market that –inexplicably –does n’t exist :
People who want to pay about the price of a low - end PC for a machine with a tenth the capabilities .
8. Let ’s see Steve Jobs match that throaty yawp .
At an event celebrating Microsoft ’s 25th anniversary , Steve Ballmer exhibits his Redmondian passion , earns the nickname Monkey Boy , and inspires an infinite number of YouTube remixes by running around and screaming .
9 . Developers , developers , developers , developers , developers , developers , developers , developers , developers , developers , developers , developers , developers , developers .
A few days after “ Monkey Boy , ” an even more maniacal , preternaturally sweaty Ballmer expresses enthusiasm for developers .
Repeatedly .
To the point of excess , really .
10 . Nice work , Egghead .
Failed computer retailer Egghead , which has reinvented itself as an online merchant , suffers a hacker attack , possibly putting the credit - card information of 3.6 million consumers at risk .
Four days pass before it alerts customers , and an investigation into what happened drags on ; the company eventually says there ’s “ no evidence ” that any data was stolen , but banks end up spending millions to replace credit cards .
The mess does n’t do anything to help Egghead ’s reputation and it files for bankruptcy in August 2001 .
2001
11 . Because there ’s nothing more beloved than hail .
Microsoft announces an array of consumer services code - named HailStorm , including the ability to store personal information on Microsoft servers for use by companies all around the Web .
Neither consumers nor companies are thrilled with the prospect , and HailStorm quietly fizzles out in 2002 .
12 . What a freckin’ lousy idea .
Paraplegic Paul Morgan , also known as “ Freck , ” announces that he ’s going to chop off his feet with a homemade guillotine on Halloween , and Webcast the deed on the Internet before paying customers at CutOffMyFeet.com .
He does n’t .
13 . A hell of a grocery bill .
After spending more than a billion dollars on high - tech warehouses , grocery delivery services WebVan declares bankruptcy , lays off two thousand employees , and ceases operations .
14 . Pricey mistake , but a pittance compared to WebVan .
In August , once - promising operating system BeOS – the runner - up to Steve Jobs ’ NeXT as foundation for Apple ’s next - generation OS –is sold to Palm for $ 11 million .
Palm uses BeOS technology in Cobalt , an OS that never actually appears on a shipping device .
15 . Tasteless and annoying .
Moving and patriotic , but still tasteless and annoying .
In the wake of the 9/11 attacks , Webcam purveyor X10 does n’t stop its blizzard of pop-up ads featuring pictures of girls in bikinis–it just adds a solemn commemorative message to them .
16 . Proof that reincarnation exists .
At least for talking paperclips .
In October , Microsoft releases Windows XP , a pretty good operating system tarnished by a mediocre search feature starring a canine “ companion . ”
Yes , he was in XP Pro as well as XP Home .
No , Microsoft had n’t learned a thing from the universal contempt for Office 97 ’s Assistants .
Even a column on Microsoft.com says that some people “ loathe ” the mutt .
17 . I ’m still planning to buy one .
Once the price hits , say , $ 74.99 .
A mysterious invention known as Ginger is said to be so transformative that cities will be built around it .
New Hampshire inventor Dean Kamen ’s creation turns out to be a $ 3000 high - tech scooter ; however cool it may be , it ca n’t possibly live up to the hype , and some cities move to ban it as a hazard to pedestrians .

We are n’t designing copies of web pages , we ’re designing web pages .
Andy Clarke , via Quotes on Design
The old way
I used to think the best place to design a website was in an image editor .
I ’d create a pixel - perfect PSD filled with generic content , send it off to the client , go through several rounds of revisions , and eventually create the markup .
Does this process sound familiar ?
You ’re not alone .
In a very scientific and official survey I conducted , close to 90 % of respondents said they design in Photoshop before the browser .
That process is whack , yo !
Recently , thanks in large part to the influence of design hero Dan Cederholm , I ’ve come to the conclusion that a website ’s design should begin where it ’s going to live : in the browser .
Die Photoshop , die
Some of you may be wondering , “ what ’s so bad about using Photoshop for the bulk of my design ? ”
Well , any seasoned designer will tell you that working in Photoshop is akin to working in a minefield : you never know when it ’s going to blow up in your face .
Photoshop ’s propensity to crash at crucial moments is a running joke in the industry , as is its barely usable interface .
And do n’t even get me started on the hot , steaming pile of crap that is text rendering .
Crashing and text rendering issues suck , but we ’ve learned to live with them .
The real issue with using Photoshop for mockups is the expectations you ’re setting for a client .
When you send the client a static image of the design , you ’re not giving them the whole picture — they ca n’t see how a fluid grid would function , how the design will look in a variety of browsers , basic interactions like : hover effects , or JavaScript behaviors .
For more on the disadvantages to showing clients designs as images rather than websites , check out Andy Clarke ’s Time to stop showing clients static design visuals .
A necessary evil ?
In the past we ’ve put up with Photoshop because it was vital to achieving our beloved rounded corners , drop shadows , outer glows , and gradients .
However , with the recent adaptation of CSS3 in major browsers , and the slow , joyous death of IE6 , browsers can render mockups that are just as beautiful as those created in an image editor .
With the power of RGBA , text - shadow , box - shadow , border - radius , transparent PNGs , and @font - face combined , you can create a prototype that radiates shiny awesomeness right in the browser .
If you can see this epic article through to the end , I ’ll show you step by step how to create a gorgeous mockup using mostly markup .
Get started by getting naked
Content precedes design .
Design in the absence of content is not design , it ’s decoration .
Jeffrey Zeldman
In the beginning , do n’t even think about style .
Instead , start with the foundation : the content .
Lay the groundwork for your markup order , and ensure that your design will be useable with styles and images turned off .
This is great for prioritizing the content , and puts you on the right path for accessibility and search engine optimization .
Not a bad place to start , amirite ?
Flush out the layout
The next step is to structure the content in a usable way .
With CSS , making basic layout changes is as easy as switching up a float , so experiment to see what structure suits the content best .
Got your grids covered
There are a variety of tools that allow you to layer a grid over your browser window .
For Mac users I recommend using Slammer , and PC users can check out one of the bookmarklets that are available , such as 960 Gridder .
Once you ’ve found a layout that works well for the content , pass it along to the client for review .
This keeps them involved in the design process , and gives them an idea of how the site will be structured when it ’s live .
Start your styling
Now for the fun part : begin applying the presentation layer .
Let usability considerations drive your decisions about color and typography ; use highlighted colors and contrasting typefaces on elements you wish to emphasize .
RGBA ?
More like RGB yay !
Introducing color is easy with RGBA .
I like to start with the page ’s main color , then use white at varying opacities to empasize content sections .
Laying down type
Just like with color , you can use typography to evoke a feeling and direct a user ’s attention .
Have contrasting typefaces ( like serif headlines and sans - serif body text ) to group the content into meaningful sections .
In a recent A List Apart article , the Master of Web Typography ™ Jason Santa Maria offers excellent advice on how to choose your typefaces :
Write down a general description of the qualities of the message you are trying to convey , and then look for typefaces that embody those qualities .
Sounds pretty straightforward .
I wanted to give my design a classic feel with a hint of nostalgia , so I used Georgia for the headlines , and incorporated the ornate ampersand from Baskerville into the header .
Let ’s get sexy
The design does n’t look too bad as it is , but it ’s still pretty flat .
We can do better , and after mixing in some CSS3 and a couple of PNGs , it ’s going to get downright steamy in here .
Give it some glow
Objects in the natural world reflect light , so to make your design feel tangible and organic , give it some glow .
In the example design I achieved this by creating two white to transparent gradients of varying opacities .
Both have a solid white border across their top , which gives edges a double border effect and makes them look sharper .
Using CSS3 ’s text - shadow on headlines and box - shadow on content modules is another quick way to add depth .
37 pieces of flair
Okay , maybe you do n’t need that much flair , but it could n’t hurt to add a little ; it ’s the details that will set your design apart .
Work in imagery and texture , using PNGs with an alpha channel so you can layer images and still tweak the color later on .
Send it off
Hey , look at that .
You ’ve got a detailed , well structured mockup for the client to review .
Best of all , your markup is complete too .
If the client approves the design at this stage , your template is practically finished .
Bust out the party hats !
Not so fast , Buster !
So I do n’t know about you , but I ’ve never gotten a design past the client ’s keen eye for criticism on the first go .
Let ’s review some hypothetical feedback ( none of which is too outlandish , in my experience ) , and see how we ’d make the requested changes in the browser .
Updating the typography
My ex-girlfriend loved Georgia , so I never want to see it again .
Can we get rid of it ?
I want to use a font that ’s chunky and loud , just like my stupid ex-girlfriend .
Fakey McClient
Yikes !
Thankfully with CSS , removing Georgia is as easy as running a find and replace on the stylesheet .
In my revised mockup , I used @font - face and League Gothic on the headlines to give the typography the , um , unique feel the client is looking for .
Adding rounded corners
I ’m not sure if I ’ll like it , but I want to see what it ’d look like with rounded corners .
My cousin , a Web 2.0 marketing guru , says they ’re trendy right now .
Fakey McClient
Switching to rounded corners is a nightmare if you ’re doing your mockup in Photoshop , since it means recreating most of the shapes and UI elements in the design .
Thankfully , with CSS border - radius comes to our rescue !
By applying this gem of a style to a handful of classes , you ’ll be rounded out in no time .
Making changes to the color
The design is too dark , it ’s depressing !
They call it ‘ the blues ’ for a reason , dummy .
Can you try using a brighter color ?
I want orange , like Zeldman uses .
Fakey McClient
Making color changes is another groan - inducing task when working in Photoshop .
Finding and updating every background layer , every drop shadow , and every link can take forever in a complex PSD .
However , if you ’ve done your mockup in markup with RGBA and semi- transparent PNGs , making changes to your color is as easy as updating the body background and a few font colors .
Ahem , what about Internet Explorer ?
Gee , thanks for reminding me , buzzkill .
Several of the CSS features I ’ve suggested you use , such as RGBA , text - shadow and box - shadow , and border - radius , are not supported in Internet Explorer .
I know , it makes me sad too .
However , this does n’t mean you ca n’t try these techniques out in your markup based mockups .
The point here is to get your mockups done as efficiently as possible , and to keep the emphasis on markup from the very beginning .
Once the design is approved , you and the client have to decide if you can live with the design looking different in different browsers .
Is it so bad if some users get to see drop shadows and some do n’t ?
Or if the rounded corners are missing for a portion of your audience ?
The design wo n’t be broken for IE people , they ’re just missing out on a few visual treats that other users will see .
The idea of rewarding users who choose modern browsers is not a new concept ;
Dan covers it thoroughly in Handcrafted CSS , and it ’s been written about in the past by Aaron Gustafson and Andy Clarke on several occasions .
I believe we should n’t have to design for the lowest common denominator ( cough , IE6 users , cough ) ; instead we should create designs that are beautiful in modern browsers , but still degrade nicely for the other guy .
However , some clients just are n’t that progressive , and in that case you can always use background images for drop shadows and rounded corners , as you have in the past .
Closing thoughts
With the advent of CSS3 , browsers are just as capable of giving us beautiful , detailed mockups as Photoshop , and in half the time .
I ’m not the only one to make an argument for this revised process ; in his article Time to stop showing clients static design visuals , and in his presentation Walls Come Tumbling Down , Andy Clarke makes a fantastic case for creating your mockups in markup .
So I guess my challenge to you for 2010 is to get out of Photoshop and into the code .
Even if the arguments for designing in the browser are n’t enough to make you change your process permanently , it ’s worthwhile to give it a try .
Look at the New Year as a time to experiment ; applying constraints and evaluating old processes can do wonders for improving your efficiency and creativity .
Feb. 3 , 2010  --
A strange tale of oral sex , a knife fight and the most unlikely of pregnancies recently brought to light by the blogosphere has doctors touting the triumphant persistence of sperm .
In 1988 , a 15 - year - old girl living in the small southern African nation of Lesotho came to local doctors with all the symptoms of a woman in labor .
But the doctors were quickly puzzled because , upon examination , she did n't have a vagina .
" Inspection of the vulva showed no vagina , only a shallow skin dimple , " so doctors delivered a healthy baby boy via Caesarean , the authors wrote in a case report published in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology .
Her birth defect -- called Mullerian agenesis or Mayer - Rokitansky - Küster - Hauser syndrome -- did n't necessarily surprise doctors , but her pregnancy did .
Even the 15 - year - old girl could not believe she was pregnant .
Yet by looking at her records the hospital staff realized the young woman was in the hospital 278 days earlier with a knife wound to her stomach .
The average pregnancy lasts 280 days .
After interviews , they gathered that " Just before she was stabbed in the abdomen she had practiced fellatio with her new boyfriend and was caught in the act by her former lover .
The fight with knives ensued . "
The girl arrived at the hospital with an empty stomach -- and therefore with little stomach acid around -- and doctors found two holes from a stab wound that opened her stomach up to her abdominal cavity .
The case report said doctors washed her stomach out with a salt solution and stitched her up .
" A plausible explanation for this pregnancy is that spermatozoa gained access to the reproductive organs via the injured gastrointestinal tract , " the authors wrote .
Infertility experts note the story , which resurfaced on a Discovery magazine blog , is not only a testament to Murphy 's Law but one to arguably nature 's most impressive swimmers : sperm .
How Could Sperm Survive Those Conditions ?
" Here 's an unbelievable set of coincidences , " said Dr. Richard Paulson , head of the University of Southern California Fertility Program in Los Angeles .
" But it 's totally plausible . "
Although doctors know that sperm needs a low acid ( high pH ) environment to survive , and would likely die eventually in the low pH of stomach acid , doctors also said that sperm comes in a protective fluid : ejaculate , a nourishing medium meant to protect the sperm .
Besides , " out of hundreds of millions of sperm if you knock out 90 percent of them , you 're still going to have tens of millions of sperm , " said Dr. Peter Schlegel , chairman of urology at New York Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York .
Paulson agreed .
" Sperm are pretty hardy , " said Paulson , who pointed out that sperm must make it out of the acidic environment of the vagina before reaching more friendly territory at the cervix and in the uterus .
Once in the abdominal wall , Paulson estimated that the sperm could survive for days .
" It 's a long way from the stomach into the lower abdomen , it 's a heck of a trip , but they made it , " said Paulson .
" You just need sperm somewhere in the area of an egg . "
Paulson said in the early days of fertility treatments in the 1980s , doctors injected sperm in the lower abdomen hoping for the coincidental encounter with an egg .
The procedure , called DIPI or direct intraperitoneal insemination , has largely been replaced by more effective methods .
The Lengths Sperm Can Travel
Schlegel pointed out that although fertilization typically takes place in the fallopian tubes , doctors know that sperm can normally swim up and out of the reproductive organs into the abdominal cavity .
" The sperm are naturally there at times , and eggs are naturally there , " said Schlegel .
" Eggs are released from the ovary , and they sort of dance around before they get taken up by the fallopian tube . "
Sperm Can Swim Far in the Female Body
So it seems , Schlegel concluded , that the sperm could also be taken up by the fallopian tube , as could a fertilized egg .
But some doctors are still suspicious of , or at least bewildered by the tale .
The girl 's birth defect is well known and by age 15 , doctors say most girls would have been doubling over in pain with an abdomen filled with menstrual fluid that cannot escape .
The menstrual fluid of several periods would make it even more unlikely for a pregnancy to occur .
" She 'd have pain all the time and would have a stomach full of blood all the time , and would have to be operated on , or she would eventually die , " said Dr. Sherman J. Silber , director of the infertility center of Saint Louis at St. Luke 's Hospital in Missouri .
Dr. Howard A. Zacur , a reproductive endocrinologist at Johns Hopkins , also had doubts .
" The case report here suffers from the fact that an individual with a completely obstructed vaginal outlet would have been expected to have blood accumulation in the vagina , and / or uterus , " he wrote in an e-mail .
The authors of the report guessed a pregnancy could only be possible if the girl had ovulated once or at most twice before her pregnancy .
Whatever the true story of the woman , and her now grown son , Silber said it could send a message to ordinary couples planning pregnancy .
Why Doubt the Longevity of Sperm ?
" This story is a crazy story , and there 's no way to make sense of it , " said Silber .
" But the data on sperm is that normally it 's quite good in an alkaline environment for two or three days -- that 's why the average couple wastes a lot of energy when they 're trying to get pregnant . "
Silber said he sees many couples who buy into the idea that they should time sex to coincide with the woman 's ovulation .
But Silber said the remarkable survivability of sperm means most couples do n't have to change their normal sex lives at all .
" The average American married couple tends to have sex two or three days a week , " said Silber , author of " How to Get Pregnant . "
If sperm can survive for two or three days , that means the average sex life of an American married couple results in living sperm swimming around the woman 's body every single day of the week .
" The practice to check when you ovulate and not to have sex until you 're ovulating is stupid , " Silber said .
Silber said because ovulation calendars and methods to detect ovulation are somewhat inaccurate , couples could miss ovulation and have sex too late .
" Twelve hours after ovulation , the eggs are n't good any more .
You want to have the sperm there ready and waiting for when you ovulated , " said Silber .
" It 's absolutely true that sperm can last a long time . "
I ’d like to clear up some misconceptions that have appeared in comments on various blogs , social bookmarking , and other fora in response to Monty ’s recent call for action .
Many of these have been repeated ad infinitum and it ’s time to set the record straight .
I ’d like to clear up some misconceptions that have appeared in comments on various blogs , social bookmarking , and other fora in response to Monty ’s recent call for action .
Many of these have been repeated ad infinitum and it ’s time to set the record straight .
1 ) . Monty sold MySQL to Sun .
Monty founded MySQL Ab along with David Axmark .
True .
He and David then decided they ’d like to pay their bills , and so to generate revenue , they decided to seek outside investors .
As neither of them is highly experienced with such matters , they hired Mårten Mickos , who became CEO of MySQL Ab .
At that point , Monty ’s role in day - to - day business decision making dropped to almost zero .
If any one person “ sold MySQL to Sun , ” it was Mårten .
This is not to say Mårten acted against Monty ’s express wishes .
Monty had great hopes for Sun ’s stewardship of MySQL , and only became disillusioned after some time actually working for Sun.
Mårten did the job Monty and David hired him to do , and in no way should my sentiments be construed as “ blaming ” Mårten .
But saying it was Monty ’s decision to sell to Sun is patently wrong .
It was Mårten ’s decision in concert with the outside investors he had courted .
2 ) . Monty should live with the consequences of the sale .
Let ’s use an analogy here .
Let ’s say that Red Hat ‘s investors and stockholders approve a deal to sell Red Hat to Google .
( And just for fun , let ’s assume one of the results is rebranding Red Hat Enterprise Linux as Red Goo .
It ’s my analogy . )
I think Mark Ewing and Bob Young would probably be satisfied with that decision , especially if it paid them well .
This was the case with Monty and the sale of MySQL Ab to Sun .
Now let ’s say that after a few years , Google is acquired by Microsoft .
Would Mark and Bob be pleased about the possible prospects for Red Goo ?
Would you tell them , “ This is what happens when you sell a company ? ”
Or would you , quite rightly , start being concerned about the future of one of the most important Linux distributions ?
And would you feel that Mark and Bob had reason to voice their concerns and try to do the best they could to serve their community of users , developers , and customers ?
Even if you thought Microsoft had the best intentions for Red Goo , it does n’t mean Mark and Bob have to agree with you .
Even if you believe that Oracle has the best intentions for MySQL , that does n’t mean Monty has to agree with you .
3 ) . Monty got PAID !
He ’s rich , man !
He sold MySQL Ab for a BILLION !
Monty has more money than me .
He probably has more money than you .
But remember , MySQL had investors .
MySQL Ab had Mårten .
To think Monty received US $ 1 Bn is foolish .
To think he received even a tenth of that is a mistake .
Yes , Monty got a payday .
But it was n’t what a lot of people think it was .
4 . Monty sold his business , and now he just wants to get it all back for free !
Part one ?
True .
Part two ?
Not so much .
Monty ’s business was sold .
He has now started a new business ( Monty Program ) and employs a lot of the former MySQL coders , as well as strange Free Software wonks ( that ’s me , for those of you keeping score at home ) .
We all work on MariaDB , a fork of MySQL that does not have a pay - for “ Enterprise Edition ” and that actively seeks great contributions from the wider open source community .
Let ’s say that Oracle buys Sun , and completely trashes MySQL .
Who benefits ?
Monty Program .
MariaDB will immediately become the de facto replacement in most Linux distros and in the minds of most people .
Let ’s say Oracle has to sell the MySQL unit as part of the remedy for the EC ’s concerns .
Monty ca n’t buy it .
As I said , he ’s got money , but not that kind of money .
And who would get hurt if Oracle sells it or does a great job stewarding the project in the future ?
Monty Program .
Now , I like getting a paycheck .
I want Monty Program to succeed so that my wife and I are n’t eating out of cat food tins at the bus station .
But I also like principled people that care , really care , about the projects they love .
And that ’s why Monty is potentially hurting our business prospects by raising his concerns with the European Commission .
He cares about the code he has worked on for 27 years .
He cares about the companies that have built a business on that code .
And he cares about the users of that code ; be they Fortune 50 companies or your teenage brother running WordPress .
Part of me wants to slap Monty .
I want our company to become the standard .
Now .
Part of me wants to kiss Monty .
He ’s the kind of dedicated and thoughtful steward any project deserves .
Paul McCullagh discussed this thoughtfully on his blog this week .
5 . Anyone can fork .
You did .
What ’s the big deal ?
Two words .
“ Embedded solutions . ”
A lot of companies have embedded MySQL into products they sell .
They ’re not interested in releasing their entire software stack under the GPL .
They buy licenses from Sun ( and formerly from MySQL Ab ) to allow them to embed MySQL into their products and not have to release all their source .
MariaDB , or any other fork , will never be able to offer this .
Ever .
We forked the GPL version , and so will anyone else .
Your code depends on our code and you ’re selling it to any interested party ?
You have to GPL every bit of code you sell .
I said it in my last post , and I ’ll say it again .
Forking saves the code .
It does not save the business .
And as I also said before , and will reiterate , if Oracle is so certain that forks are the answer , why did n’t they just do that months ago and save themselves the headache ?
They could have forked MySQL , taken MySQL off the table , and avoided this whole EC inquiry .
They did n’t .
Think about that .
6 ) . Just use Postgres .
Sure .
Go tell Google that .
Or Amazon .
Or eBay .
Or Craigslist .
Or any ISP depending on cPanel to ease customer usage of internals .
Postgres is a great project .
It delivers a a fantastic database server .
I have a lot of people in the Postgres community I consider friends .
So does Monty .
And you know what , those people would be among the first to tell you that migrating to or from one database to another is not an easy task for large deployments with thousands of lines of customized code .
They ’d also tell you that Postgres is superior to MySQL for some things , and MySQL is superior to Postgres for others .
“ Just switch to Postgres , ” is not a solution for many people , primarily businesses that have built their products on top of MySQL .
Now , can we move beyond these issues to the larger issue at hand ?
If you think Oracle ’s proposed acquisition of MySQL is probably going to turn out badly for the Free Software and open source communities , read Monty ’s blog post and act .
If you think it ’s a tempest in a teacup , I respect your right to your opinion .
Please respect Monty ’s right , and if you wish to engage people on the subject , keep the preceding points in mind .
Santa was good to me this year , I must have been a very good boy .
My brother and his wife were good to me too .
For Christmas , they bought me Bouchon Bakery ’s snappy new “ chocolate bouchon ” kit from Williams - Sonoma .
For those of you uninitiated to the joys of the chocolate bouchon to which I am referring , they are yet another brainchild of Thomas Keller , and are famously sold at both his bakeries and restaurants that bear their name .
Think of the ultimate 2 - bite brownie and you pretty much have the idea of the thing .
Named , and shaped after the French word for “ cork ” , they are nothing short of magnificent little chocolate bombs , especially good when still slightly warm from the oven .
The kit includes enough mix to make about 18 of the suckers , and a silicone mold in which to cook them .
Joy to the World …..
We made our first batch of bouchons while skiing over Christmas break , and they were universally applauded by the adults and kids alike .
They are very rich , and made with so much cocoa powder and semi-sweet chips that they turn out almost black in color ( see photo above ) .
If you do n’t like your chocolate deep and dark , then bouchons are not for you , sorry ….. you can go now .
Having eaten through our “ kit ” batch of little bombs in a heartbeat , I turned to the recipe that comes with the silicone mold ( thankfully , you are not forced to return to Willams - Sonoma for the pre-made mix every time you want to make them ) .
The thing was though , the recipe that came with the mold looked wildly different than the one that came with the mix , it did n’t look like the same recipe at all .
Boo Hoo .
I immediately scoured the internet and found that I was n’t the only one to discover this .
The recipe on the mold box will not yield bouchons even close to what you get from Keller himself .
Good news is , his recipe is available in the Bouchon Cookbook , and is the one we used to make our second batch , and while not identical to what is in the pre-made mix , yields awesome bouchons .
Even better news , the mix yields only 18 , this from scratch recipe yields a full 24 of the tasty little buggers !!!!
When we made these from scratch , the batter came out a little “ tighter ” , and resulted in a firmer bouchon .
I attribute this fact to our making the “ kit ” version by hand , and using my standing mixer to craft the “ from scratch ” recipe .
I ’m afraid in doing so , I may have over mixed the batter .
While the flavor was identical between the two batches , I preferred the texture of the “ kit ” batch , and will therefor be mixing our next batch by - hand , without the assistance of a machine .
I ’ll return to this post and let you know what I discover .
Either way you choose to go , this recipe will deliver incredibly tasty results .
Enjoy !

Well our leaders are insane .
They think they can stampede us into begging for a fascist , militaristic government by repeatedly staging " terrorist " attacks on their own people ( 9/11 , the shoe bomber , the underwear bomber , etc. ) .

Outstanding Ernest ...
I 've heard that Obama is playing high stakes chess ... I call bullshit on that .
You do n't play high stakes chess by doubling down on insanity .
Obama was bought off early on .
His eloquence and image of decency during the campaign now seems to just another world class psychological mind fuck by the banker - military elite ...
Only bare knuckles truth pieces like this have a chance of breaking the hypnotic spell that the M.I.C. / MSM and religious right have on the minds of Americans ... Fear is a powerful spell maker ... and Obama is using fear as his policymaking American Express card now .

I daresay few of us following this blog disagree with any of your arguments regarding where we are and why it is neither just or nor beneficial to stay there .
But the nasty question is not what happened , but rather , what happens next ?
Our new president faces reality : the mess his predecessors got us into ( and not just the Bushies ) .
But he has to begin where we are , not where we should have been .
The dilemma is how to stop what we have been doing , not whether .
Do we stop completely and instantly ?
How do we disengage ?
What residual responsibilities do we have , in Iraq and Afghanistan , to cite the more recent examples ?
Ironically , one of our greatest challenges is that we still have a somewhat representative government , meaning that Obama has to achieve some political consensus for whatever policies he adopts ; and if he tries to change course too fast , he will definitely lose all ability to change at all .
It is a very tough and probably long term task .
I still believe he has the right read on what international policies work best in the long run ; and he seems to take a world view , recognizing that we are humans more than we are Americans , and that that outlook is also parallel with our long term interests .
If our populace were more aware and more united , it would be easier for Obama to actually change policy and to communicate to the rest of the world that we are on a different course .
The world is still as tribal as it has ever been .
We are , for now , the most powerful tribe .
The dilemma is not how to be a better tribe , but rather how to end tribalism .
How do we actually get there ?

How do we stop what the bankster / military elite have been doing ?
We never stop pointing out the treason of the corrupt MIC , which includes the various officers corp .
Our corrupt Generals poison our own troops with DU munitions , treat vets like trash and much more in their traitorous quest for position , power and wealth .
They seem to desire being strutting pseudo - Roman proconsuls in the vast military empire most Americans are not even aware of .
This lack of knowledge is due to the equally traitorous MSM .
The wealth of all generals , serving ( particularly in drug growing theaters ) or retired ( it seems the vast wealth may come after moving through the revolving door into the MIC industries ) , should be investigated .

You make solid points , and I agree with the main premise .
But in fairness to the current president , he did not try to " bring the ongoing wars of choice in Afghanistan and Iraq within the concept of ' just wars ' and war as a ' last resort , ' as you said .
Yes , he did that for Afghanistan , with * some * justification , but he explicitly did NOT include Iraq in that judgment .
I think the cause of peace is well served by accuracy .

With all due respect , sunnysteve ( comment # 4 ) the fallacy of your reasoning lies in your belief that Obama actually intends to change policy .
I would direct you to a couple of my earlier pieces , " Progressives of America - Unite ! " and " Wing - Nut Mobs Provide Cover for Obama / Baucus Health Care Betrayal , " as well as David Swanson 's well - written " Will We Win ? "
I am inclined to agree with Noam Chomsky , John Pilger and other progressive intellectuals who believe that Obama is nothing more than a " marketing creation ; " that the President 's real constituency is Wall Street , the military - industrial complex and corporate America ; that , as denoted in " Progressives of America - Unite !
a greater percentage of [ corporate campaign ] funds [ now flow ] to Democrats because , in Barack Obama 's enchanting eloquence , corporate America has found an individual who could best take from the poor and give to the rich while convincing us all that he intends otherwise .
As to options , the way you end an occupation is to leave .
It would be nowhere as difficult as the proponents of perpetual war would have you believe .
I am quite sure that in Afghanistan , for example , the Taliban would be more than willing to enter a cease fire for the purpose of permitting a total withdrawal of U.S. forces --- including CIA and private mercenaries .
I 'm sure the same method could be applied to what is left of the insurgency in Iraq .
Recall that President Nixon had no problem with negotiating with the North Vietnamese .
Candidate Obama spoke of negotiations , but President Obama has made no effort to meet with the Taliban , even at the urging of the U.S. - designated puppet Karzai regime .
Of course , to engage in withdrawal may require that we relinquish our desire to control the flow of oil from the Caspian Sea states and from the massive oil fields in Iraq , and that is a price which Empire is not willing to pay .

Richard Rogers said ( comment # 7 ) :
But in fairness to the current president , he did not try to " bring the ongoing wars of choice in Afghanistan and Iraq within the concept of ' just wars ' and war as a ' last resort ' ...
__________________________
With the dyslexic George W. Bush , it was always easy to spot the B.S.
With the articulate , Harvard educated , Barack Obama , one has to parse his words , looking for the subtle means by which he obfuscates reality .
The President said , I am the Commander - in - Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars .
One of these wars is winding down .
The other is a conflict that America did not seek ; one in which we are joined by 42 other countries --- including Norway --- in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks .
This was a blending of two wars with one ( Iraq ) easily set aside as " winding down " while the other ( Afghanistan ) subtly linked to 9/11 --- a war which Obama now claims he has escalated " to defend ourselves . "
Obama then added :
The concept of a " just war " emerged , suggesting that war is justified only when certain conditions were met : if it is waged as a last resort or in self - defense .
and :
The world rallied around America after the 9/11 attacks , and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan , because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self - defense .
Likewise , the world recognized the need to confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait --- a consensus that sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression .
The President adroitly evaded mention of the fact that Saddam's " aggression " against Kuwait ( which may have actually been encouraged by U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie ) , served only as justification for Gulf War I .
It had absolutely nothing to do with the unprovoked 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Why mention Iraq twice in paragraphs designed to justify our presence in Afghanistan , where the President directly claims we waging war as a last resort --- as an essential means for self - defense ?
The President , of course , also subtly ignored the fact that the U.S. was not attacked on 9/11 by Iraq , Afghanistan or the Taliban .
What Obama was really implying is that the so - called " Global War on Terror " is a war of last resort that is essential to our self - defense , a point alluded to when he described al Qaeda as on par with Nazi Germany , adding : Negotiations cannot convince al Qaeda 's leaders to lay down their arms .
While I , for one , do not propose " negotiating with al Qaeda " for anything other than their possible surrender to the World Court , the fact is that no one has ever tried to " negotiate with al Qaeda .
As I urged in this piece , the logical response is to treat al Qadea as a criminal enterprise that must be brought to justice before the World Court under the auspices of the UN and international law --- as opposed to escalation of an irrational war which will increase rather than decrease the number of people desiring to attack us out of revenge .
But Obama makes no reference in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech to any means of dealing with al Qaeda short of " war . "
Instead , he repeated the Bush / Cheney appeal to fear , referencing nuclear weapons and stating : Terrorism has long been a tactic , but modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder innocents on a horrific scale .
The gist of the President 's remarks are clear .
While ostensibly accepting a Peace prize , he was clearly advocating a perpetual " Global War on Terror " as the only rational means for dealing with a deadly threat of an amorphous , stateless enemy who must be attacked “ anywhere at any time , or everywhere all the time . ”
Obama is Big Brother .
War is Peace .

Brad wrote : " Military - industrial complex and a U.S. - led , corporate Empire whose core purpose is to feed the insatiable greed of the privileged few . "
This makes me think about a very interesting document submitted to Congress in 1940 by a Senator from Montana , J. Thorkelson .
Many people find the document offensive ( myself included , but it is , I believe , an important one to read ) .
http://www.jordanmaxwell...tish-israel-world-$1.pdf
It is long and he certainly did n't escape the fears and prejudices of his day , but he was warning us about " foreign intrigue " ( which George Washington left office hoping we'd think about ) .
So many leaders , King , Washington , and Eisenhower echoed by Brad above , and Kennedy have tried to get us to listen , so why do n't we ?
Sunnysteve wrote " Ironically , one of our greatest challenges is that we still have a somewhat representative government , meaning that Obama has to achieve some political consensus for whatever policies he adopts ; and if he tries to change course too fast , he will definitely lose all ability to change at all . "
I 've , to my amazement actually , found that consensus is not what we need .
We need to return to the Constitutional Republic we were and are meant to be .
Consensus is simply mob-rule really .
I 've been reading ( Gilded Age to present ) rhetoric , speeches , documents , etc. , with the purpose of trying to ascertain when we drifted out to sea and what ordinary citizens can do to help .
An idea I am going with is that our ship is drifting closer and closer to an island of colonialism with the military industrial complex owned by the ' privileged few ' at the helm .
Dramatic I know , but it's how I work !
One of our greatest challenges if we wish to avoid the island will be to listen to one another .
The people must come together , sift through what we instinctively know is happening to us and leave our anger and love intellectualism at the door .
In reading all of these speeches , documents , books from Twain to Obama , the only thing I know for sure is that the privileged few love it when we fight one another .
An idea I am not sure about ( but terrified its true ) is that American ideas about freedom and liberty are sinking into oblivion ( and we have some really good ideas ) .
John F. Kennedy understood , too , what we are facing ( in another little known speech as Dr. King 's Vietnam speech ) .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hXSRS7L1xU and http://www.jfklibrary.or...erPublishers04271961.htm
In this speech he refers to dangers that I believe are essentially the same as Thorkelson's ( go figure ! )
For example : " The very word " secrecy " is repugnant in a free and open society ; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies , to secret oaths and to secret proceedings .
We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers , which are cited to justify it .
Even today , there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions .
Even today , there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it .
And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment .
That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control .
And no official of my Administration , whether his rank is high or low , civilian or military , should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news , to stifle dissent , to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know . "
John Fitzgerald Kennedy , April 27 , 1961 .
Let us please listen to one another .
We bradbloggers and prisonplanet followers ( as just one example ) need to listen and try to hear each other .
The “ complex ” cares not for us , perhaps we can care for one another .
I think we 're all we 've got .

Actually , Louis ( comment # 14 ) , if you had bothered to follow my link to my earlier piece , " Beyond Afghanistan , " you would have found the following paragraph , which I did not repeat in this article : Covert CIA intervention in Afghanistan began in 1979 in response to the Soviet invasion when , per Trento , President Carter struck a Faustian bargain .
Carter reversed an earlier decision to cut off aid to Pakistan in response to that nation 's refusal to abandon efforts to acquire nuclear weapons .
The CIA not only intervened on behalf of the Afghan mujahideen , but began pouring money into Pakistan 's intelligence service , the ISI , which diverted much of these U.S. taxpayer funds into the development of " the Islamic bomb .
The Reagan administration not only greatly expanded covert assistance to the Mujahideen , whose ranks were swollen by foreign Muslim Jihadists , including one Osama bin Laden , but it was President Reagan who personally dubbed the Afghan Jihadists as " freedom fighters . "
The fact that Carter preceded Reagan in providing covert assistance to the Afghan Mujahideen no more absolves Reagan of his expansion of that covert assistance than the fact that George W. Bush initiated the so - called " Global War on Terror " absolves Obama for his decision to escalate that irrational war .
Of course , your comment does reveal how , if I fail to bring out every fact in every article I write , I will be accused by some Reagan or Bush or Obama apologist of " letting the facts get in the way of the ' story . ' "
The truth is that CIA - support of the Mujahideen under Carter was relatively brief as compared to that under Reagan .
Your suggestion that Reagan's " freedom fighters " were not " Reagan 's Mujahideen " is either uninformed or intellectually dishonest .
But nice try !

Oh , Louis , here 's another little tidbit from " Beyond Afghanistan " that I left out of this piece : " By the mid-80's , Reagan 's Afghan " freedom fighters " ... with the aid of Pakistan 's ISI intelligence agency , turned Afghanistan into the world 's single largest exporter of opium and the source of half the heroin consumed in the US .
" According to P. Scott & J. Marshall 's Cocaine Politics ( 1991 ) , the Bank of Credit and Commerce International ( BCCI ) would " go out of its way to attract [ Afghan ] drug money , facilitate arms transactions , and cater to the CIA , all the while enjoying an extraordinary , if still unexplained , degree of immunity from prosecution . "
In Prelude to Terror ( 2005 ) , Trento revealed that BCCI 's immunity derived from the relationship between George H.W. Bush and Sheik Kamal Adham , the former Director of Saudi Intelligence .
" With the official blessing of George Bush as the head of the CIA , Adham transformed [ BCCI ] into a worldwide money - laundering machine , buying banks around the world in order to create the biggest clandestine money network in history . "
" Opium production would drop off dramatically under the Taliban only to return with a vengeance following the late 2001 U.S. invasion .
By October 2006 Afghanistan produced 87 % of the world 's opium .
" Ahmed Wali Karzai has been on the CIA payroll for the past eight years .
He is linked to the Afghan heroin trade .
Ahmed is the brother of Afghan President Hamid Karzai . "
In again referring to the Mujahideen as Reagan 's " freedom fighters , " in this piece , it was no more my intent to absolve the role played by George H.W. Bush than it was to absolve Carter / Brzezinski .

Insanity ?
Insanity is asking the same silly questions while trying to explain behaviors and actions of leaders who are apart of the criminality which has made you insane in the first place .
I can see that Brad is asking for some more money again .
Good for you .
Brad .... my offer still stands so let me repeat .
I will provide you or ANYONE on the planet ONE MILLION DOLLARS in US currency CASH ..... if you can provide ONE single piece of verifiable debris from ANY of the 4 planes from ANY of the 4 locations on 9/11 .
Sounds like easy money huh ?
Especially when over 5 Billion people already " believe and saw " that the planes of 9/11 have physically been verified in ANY WAY ?!
Its been over 9 years and not ONE single piece of debris has EVER been physically verified in any way shape or form from any of the " planes " of 9/11 .
Not one single piece !
( In shanksville , authorities piled thousands of pieces of debris into a rusty dumpster .... NOT ONE SINGLE PIECE COULD BE IDENTIFIED IN ANY WAY AS HAVING COME FROM FLIGHT 93 .... even though there are 2 million + pieces PER PLANE .... which can instantly verify a plane through a standard serial number ?!)
Insanity is contiuning to try and analyze events and behavior when all your pre-concieved notions about reality and truth are based completely and totally on lies of the highest caliber .
There were no commercial plane crashes on 9/11 .
This truth will explain ALL the behaviors and actions since that very day by the US government , military , and military owned corporate US media outlets .
Of course Barack wants to continue illegal wars ..... he knows all the lies and continued murder from 9/11 .
Understanding why criminals committ crimes drives the sane insane ?

Where Does A Democrat Go From Here ?
It 's hard to own the disappointment I feel over our moderate corporate Democratic President .
The whole Obama phenomenon brings up memories from my distant past : the good - looking guy who talks real good , whose line you do n't buy immediately but whose charm is so dazzling that he gradually convinces you that this time it will be different .
Yeah .
Right .
Really different .
What the current administration is giving us is minimal change .
And not because the President has n't had the time to do better ; if he had truly wanted to make fundamental change , he would have gone in there fast and done his own version of shock and awe in the first hundred days .
And not because he did n't realize how mean all those Republicans can be , either ; Obama knew what he was getting into , and if he did n't , then he was as unprepared for the job as his opponents said he was .
I see so many people now --- many of them men , interestingly enough --- tangled up in an almost school - girlish , co-dependent , apologetic relationship with this President .
As though " poor baby " should be tacked onto the end of every description of his failures .
I see all things political in light of the immense unnecessary suffering in the world .
Republicans see it and say , " Wow , it 's sad about all that suffering , but the government has no proper role in assuaging it .
Hopefully the private sector will do something .
That would be nice . "
The Democrats --- not all of them but enough of them , and definitely this President --- see all that suffering and say , " Wow , it 's sad about all that pain people are going through .
Let 's try to assuage it . "
And yet they 're refusing to do anything to challenge the underlying forces that make all that suffering inevitable .
I remember Bobby and I remember Martin .
I remember when there was a moral force
at the center of the Democratic Party .
I see it sometimes still , in a Sherrod Brown , a Dennis Kucinich , an Anthony Weiner .
But they 're not reflective of the general tenor of the Democratic Party anymore , and I think we would all do well to wake up to that fact .
We elected Obama and then he sort of became someone else .
He 's doing a lot of good things in various areas , but he 's certainly not changing the new bottom line : that corporations get to run the world .
He bailed out the banks , but he did n't stipulate that they had to start lending again .
He got us health care , but he would n't say a word about single payer and he would n't raise a finger for the public option .
He won the Nobel Peace Prize , but accepted it with a speech that was an apologia for war .
Democrats seem to have no idea what dark wave is rushing towards them in the form of the 2010 mid-terms .
They have no idea how many people will be too depressed to go vote , who 'll be thinking , " We tried so hard last time , and what did it get us ? "
They have no idea how many people are thinking , as I am , that it 's time to face the facts , no matter how painful they are .
If Obama does n't retrieve his spine and retrieve it soon , then his Presidency will go down in the history books as one of the biggest disappointments in American history .
In the meantime , we should be looking at our options .
In " Healing the Soul of America " , I wrote about Ghandi 's notion of soul force in politics and why it matters to stand on your truth .
Should we re-brand the Green Party perhaps , or draft another Democrat to challenge Obama in the primaries in 2012 ?
I do n't know what we should do , but I know one thing that we should n't do : pretend to ourselves that this man is delivering on what he promised when he first won our hearts .

Very perceptive , NYCartist .
The title is derived from MLK's " Beyond Vietnam " speech in which he observed : " Somehow this madness must cease . "
That was in 1967 --- nearly 43 years ago , yet , as I set forth in detail within this article , the madness has not ceased .
It has expanded .
The " we , " somewhat tongue in cheek , refers to American citizens , as a whole .
Oh , I know that there are volumes of material , such as Norman Solomon 's War Made Easy , which discuss the extent to which governments , corporations and corporate media have deployed effective propaganda with which to convince us in each instance that the current war is the " good war ; " that the U.S. is simply a bulwark of democracy , tirelessly and selflessly policing the world against evil organizations and states who desire to destroy democracy --- restated in its most befuddled form by George W. Bush as they attack us " because they hate our freedom . "
But then there is Johann Wolfgang von Goethe :
We are never deceived ; we deceive ourselves .
Whether through lack of effort , a failure of civic responsibility , or simply when we act out of fear , we , as a people , have permitted the madness to continue .
We have permitted our leaders and pundits to sell us an irrational " Global War on Terror . "
Some of us , myself included , who understand the corrupt , dysfunctional and deadly nature of our capitalist Empire and the military - industrial complex it has spawned , have failed to communicate that understanding in a sufficient manner so as to pierce the corporate media fog that clouds the minds of so many of our fellow citizens .
Like our fellow Americans who fail to meet the responsibility of citizenship by failing to actively seek out the fundamental facts that are readily available through the internet ; via sites like Democracy Now , our failure to adequately reach out to those fellow Americans reflects that we are all , in some measure , responsible for the failure to bring an end to the " madness " which MLK admonished us , " must cease . "
Hence , the title , " We Must be Insane " What else explains how easy it was for the Bush regime , for example , to convince so many Americans that a nation whose military forces ( Iraq ) had been decimated by Gulf War I , 13 years of devastating economic sanctions and near continuous air assaults in the " no fly zones " constituted so grave a danger to the nation ( the U.S. ) which possesses by far the most destructive military arsenal ever known to man , that the only logical course was an immediate , preemptive strike ?
In George Orwell 's 1984 there was the " three minutes of hate . "
We get the three minutes of hate 24/7 courtesy of Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck and the Tea Bag Express .
Sounds insane to me .

Ernie writes : " Some of us , myself included , who understand the corrupt , dysfunctional and deadly nature of our capitalist Empire and the military - industrial complex it has spawned , have failed to communicate that understanding in a sufficient manner so as to pierce the corporate media fog that clouds the minds of so many of our fellow citizens .

Though the mere SUGGESTION that there were no commercial plane crashes on 9/11 and that all of 9/11 was a staged lie ROCKS this poor Ernie to the core of his being with denial and disbelief .

Its amazing to read such a paragraph from Ernie the lawyer / author .... and to then read his reply when you inform him that there were no commercial plane crashes on 9/11 staged by these EXACT CRIMINALS in government , media , and corporations that he is describing ???

We have grown soft over the years , too displaced from the harsh realities of official segregation policies and the blood spilt to reverse them ( on the books anyway . )
I 'm in my tenth year of teaching in public schools , and aside from the year spent in Cairo , I 've been involved in the planning and production of the MLK assemblies throughout .
This time of year reflects exactly what the problem with the Democratic party is - general spinelessness , unwillingness to target the root causes of societal ills , tacit deference to the reptilian brain for fear of offending .
I see this every time I try to insert the " complete " King into the assemblies .
It always focuses on racism and tolerance and what we could or should do as individuals to " play nice " .
Fine , well enough , I suppose , we could do worse - but the reaction I get from colleagues even when I talk to them about King 's anti-militarism , anti-war , anti-class - warfare , pro-labor positions , you 'd think they had either forgotten ( or never learned ) that this man was despised by many elements in our government , labeled Communist and traitor ... and of course , eventually assassinated by ( not James Earl Ray . )
This is what we leave our youth to find out by themselves , if they have a care to .
Who is this man whom we hold up as an ideal emblem of tolerance and free speech , without being as real as possible about why he said what he said , what the consequences of speeches like Beyond Vietnam were ( or should have been . )
It makes people very uncomfortable and for the most part they 'd rather leave the stuff out that still challenges the powers that be - especially in the public schools ( " we ca n't talk about that , that 'd really get parents hackles up " , etc. )
Always " I Have A Dream " , never " time to clean house . "
Our public " celebration " of MLK always rings hollow to me .
Same as the words of Obama .

First , Dana J. , the issues of Empire and the military - industrial complex neither begin nor end with 9/11 .
Second , the " legal " response to 9/11 I set forth in this article --- the arrest and prosecution of all who were complicit in the event --- would not exclude prosecution of anyone who was involved " from the inside " provided that " evidence " could be presented that would " prove " that 9/11 was an " inside job . "
Third , the issue of why WTC 7 collapsed in the span of 8.7 seconds into its own footprint is indeed significant and warrants further study , especially since it was not struck by a plane .
Fourth , it 's not that I am " rocked to the core " by your assertion that " no commercial planes crashed on 9/11 . "
It 's simply that you offer absolutely no " evidence " to support your claim .
Simply one outlandish claim after another .
You obviously have very strongly held beliefs about 9/11 , but I am only interested in facts and evidence .
I will no more accept your " beliefs " on faith than I would accept Sarah Palin's " belief " in End Times on faith , or for that matter , than I would accept the rants of a holocaust denier who claims that films of concentration camps were made up as well .
( Especially since I knew someone who served in Gen. Patton 's 4th Armor Division and entered those camps at the end of the war ) .
Absent " proof " --- and you have provided none --- your " no commercial plane " theory suggests that you are suffering from a paranoid delusion .

Your credibility is mortally wounded there Dana J.... millions ... hell 10's of millions of Americans witnessed two planes crash into the WTC ... now I grant you that who caused those crashes is highly speculative .
Personally I highly doubt that a squad of middle easterners , who only had some flight school training in Florida , Would be able to achieve two perfect hits on those relatively small targets ... I would think it takes a highly skilled and experienced pilot to strike those buildings with that kind of accuracy ... both on the first pass mind you ... UNLESS !
Those planes were electronically / lasered in to target those buildings without pilot intervention at all ; drone like ... I would be willing to believe that their were NO middle easterners on the planes that hit those towers ...
As far as the dubious Pentagon and the highly nefarious plane crash in Pennsylvania fantasies .... well I do n't believe those events were as explained either ...
But your shrill attacks on Ernest Canning and his explanations ... do n't wash with me .
You 're one of the reasons that people that do n't buy the MSM lies get labeled as crazy conspiracy theorists ... because you sound of kind hysterical .

Ernie the burn writes : " Absent " proof " --- and you have provided none "
This will be my last post on this thread .
YOU , the US military , FBI , CIA , SS , Homeland Security .... have yet to provide ONE SINGLE SPECK of verifiable debris from a single plane from a single location from 9/11 .
Until then ... there were no commercial plane crashes on 9/11 .
My ONE Million dollar bounty is still there for the taking ?
Do you want it Ernie ?
Verify the debris from any of the planes from any of the locations from 9/11 and its yours .
Anyone reading this at a later date will soon realize why the million dollars has never been claimed ( or promoted in the media for that matter ) .
Its to force you to investigate in great detail PERSONALLY every aspect of the supposed planes and passengers of 9/11 .
That is exactly what the army of gatekeepers never want you to focus on .
They will use misdirection , focused questioning , personal put downs and insults , and questions of mental health and public ridicule ... basically the intro-handbook handed out at military disinformation classes .
Why ?
Because there were no commercial plane crashes on 9/11 .
Its essential that you never focus on that .
Its essential that you feel " stupid " for even asking or questioning .
The never ending US global war on terror would have to end ?
No terror on 9/11 ..... no more war on terror ?
This truth could put alot of people out of a job ?
No commercial plane crashes on 9/11 exposes 100's of other crimes ..... including election fraud to make it happen the way it did in the first place .
It ties into almost every aspect of government and military criminality that this site exposes everyday .
Why would the lies of 9/11 be any different .
There were no commercial plane crashes on 9/11 .
The war on terro must end .
Thanx Ernie and Brad .
Take care .
I will not be back and will take brads suggestion of going elsewhere .

If I ask a witness in court if the grass was green and he begins to tell me that the sky is blue , I ask the judge to strike the response and direct the witness to answer the question .
Brad , in comment # 6 , did no more than ask for any " evidence " that supports the contention that 12/25/09 was an act of state terrorism .
He did not get into issues of the cause of 9/11 .
Think of 12/25/09 as the green grass and 9/11/01 as the blue sky .
Get the picture ?
Yet , your comment # 7 then blasted Brad about an issue --- 9/11 --- that had nothing to do with Brad 's question .
You see , the problem with you self - described " Truthers " --- aside from a proclivity to ignore evidence --- is that your behavior is really quite boorish .
It does n't matter what topic we deal with , Empire , Health Care , Karl Rove , ACORN , voting irregularities .
No matter the topic , you can be counted on to barge in and rudely claim that it 's 9/11 .
It 's always 9/11 !
And nothing else in life matters , but 9/11 .

BlueHawk - I am a 9/11 " truther " in that I think the government 's story is complete bullshit .
That does n't mean I know what happened , how , or why ... but there is plenty of circumstantial " evidence " that what went down on 9/11 was planned well in advance by individuals who had key access to the buildings , control over the response , and control over the investigation .
Quite frankly , the collapse of the towers without extra help does not seem at all reasonable given the history of building fires of that magnitude in the past .
Anyway , there are many things that remain unexplained by other than " that 's just how it happened this time " , which is not at all satisfactory .
Bottom line is we never got a real investigation and we never got any real answers .
Until the government does some kind of real investigation , the 9/11 truth movement will never go away - nor should it .
As far as not providing rational , reasonable discourse , there are plenty of websites that ask legitimate questions and provide credible testimony as to possibilities and probabilities ( start with Prof .
Jones from BYU and his scientific analysis of thermite presence and the physics of building collapse ) .
If the 9/11 truthers can be accused of theorizing without evidence , then surely the government should be accused of the same , no ?
I mean , that Commission Report does n't really mean anything to anybody , does it ?
Anyway , I would n't have weighed in here on this ( because it is " off topic " ) , however the " you 9/11 truthers " barbs stung me enough that I thought a response was warranted .

9/11 is a gigantically complex issue , and I agree with Ernest ( Great article , by the way ) --- the problems of the military - industrial complex ( et al ) neither begin nor end with 9/11 .
9/11 is neither the beginning nor the end of the world .
9/11 ( the act itself , inasmuch as it was perpetrated by whomever ; and the perception thereof , inasmuch as most all of us were fairly easily duped into rejecting our own intuitions , not to mention the laws of physics ) is merely a symptom of a long - developing and persistently gathering storm .
9/11 is a spiritual problem .
Let 's not attack people who do n't have our exact theory of 9/11 ; stick to the evidence , not ideological litmus tests .

To BlueHawk 1/4/2010 @ 9:29 pm PT ,
The issue is not evidence .
The evidence is inescapable for anyone interested in finding it .
The issue is whether an individual can stand the truth ( sorry , I do n't mean to sound trite ) .
However , evidence can be found here : http://www.ae911truth.org/, here : http://www.911weknow.com/911-mysteries-dvd, and thousands of other sites .
The MSM itself showed beyond a shadow of a doubt , for those paying attention , that no Boeing crashed into the Pentagon and no airliner disappeared into that mine in PA .
How about BBC reporting WTC7 had collapsed 20 minutes before it did ?
Gosh , do you think they got the script a little early maybe ?
http://www.wtc7.net/bbc.html
Here 's a quandary , why did the second tower hit fall first ?
If you look at the smoke , it had turned black --- i.e. , the fires were almost out .
It seems it was take it down , or give up the game .
I 'm sure in Germany there were those who refused to believe or even entertain that the Reichstag fire was state terror .
What 's the practical difference between a Good German refusing to listen to BBC and an actual Nazi ?

@ Earnest Canning and reply # 24 :
I am looking at 7 0 at the end of next month .
I have heard the ML King Jr speech many times on WBAI .
( Note : There 's been a coup at WBAI , my local community listener supported station , which marks its 50th birthday next weekend - when it was a gift to the Pacifica Network .
I support www.takebackwbai.org)
The people do n't want war - which Nazi said that ?
And have to be propagandized .
I think Fox and Chenney and Bush did that so that long after going into Iraq people seemed to be a majority in support .
My opinion .
The majority were opposed to staying in Afghanistan ( I was in support of a police action , not invasion , bombing , etc. )
( I said so on the airwaves of WBAI as a listener , when a San Fran professor said he thought it was a good idea .
A couple of years later , I reminded him that he was wrong , but he still insisted it was good to invade .
A progressive . )
I have lived through the opposition to the war on Vietnam and think that those of us who were in our 20s lived through a vibrant , optimistic period of America .
My " dream " died with the various assassinations of leaders , but the spark did n't die out .
My small contributions to activism have continued , as can , as I ride out disabling illness , adding disability rights to human / civil rights / peace activism in recent decades .
That 's why I give you a " hard time " on use of " insane " as behavior that 's " bad " .
Rev. Dr. King used " war as madness " which is not quite the same and it was then .
Finally , to me , Dr. King was an older person , when we lived at the same time , as he was in his 30s .
Yup .
When there was dissention over some of his policies in " the movement " , I was an observer , in my small role at LCDC , civil rights law office in NOLA .
I knew he was a great leader at the time .
I never met him .

JACKO @37 I 'm aware of most of the 9/11 evidence and I find it compelling .... what I 'm irritated about is being constantly bashed over the head with it .
I 've stated on another thread ... I 've watched 9/11 truth drive other topics off the road , topics that were just as important , just as critical to be aired and explored .
Most 9/11 truth folks have been strident and dismissive to others in their statements and that gets old too ... After 8 years of W Bush and a year of Obama most people here can indeed " handle the truth " .
It 's not simply an issue of being able to - handle the truth - of what actually happened on 9/11 ...
For me it 's an issue of being able to handle the multi- faceted con job perpetrated on this country and cover it like a fog and digest it fully ... 9/11 truth is an element of the hijacking - coup that happended to America ... not the whole of it .
9/11 truthers ( alot of them ) need to give people the room to decide for themselves about the evidence of 9/11 ... without being dismissed , called names or smeared as unworthy of respect .
A lot of people 's focus is on other aspects of " the truth movement " and have n't studied just the 9/11 incident ...
You guys could be a lot more tolerant of that .

The Nazi to whom you refer , NYCartist , was Hermann Goering , who said : Naturally the common people do n't want war ; neither in Russia , nor in England , nor in America , nor in Germany .
That is understood .
But after all , it is the leaders of the country who determine policy , and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along , whether it is a democracy , or a fascist dictatorship , or a parliament , or a communist dictatorship .
Voice or no voice , the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders .
That is easy .
All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked , and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger .
It works the same in any country .

Evidence that the painkiller Vioxx might increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes emerged nearly four years before the drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market , research has shown .
Vioxx , the brand name for rofecoxib , was designed to fight the pain of arthritis .
It was launched in May 1999 by Merck & Co Inc .
But in September 2004 , Merck voluntarily pulled Vioxx following a large trial that was halted early after finding evidence linking Vioxx to a raised risk of cardiovascular events .
In November 2004 , Merck 's then chief executive Raymond Gilmartin testified before a US Senate finance committee that until the halted trial , there was no suggestion from research data that patients taking Vioxx were at increased risk .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yesterday , experts from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York writing in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine produced evidence of clear concerns about Vioxx from December 2000 onwards .
NBC Universal has licensed the medical drama to 250 territories worldwide so far .
But the show ’s popularity in Europe is startling .
In France , it averaged 9.3 million viewers per episode for broadcaster TF1 during its latest season – up 30 % on the previous season .
Last year , Italian channel Canale 5 averaged 4.7 million viewers when it showed House on Sunday nights .
Germany was not far behind with 4.2 million viewers for broadcaster RTL .
It ’s also incredibly popular in Poland , where TV2 averaged 3.3 million viewers per episode , and in the Netherlands , where it averaged 793,000 for SBS6 .
Television ratings analyst Mediametrie rated House the most popular U.S. import across 29 territories in 2008 .
And it looks set to do that again in 2009 .
Almost 72 million people outside of the U.S. watched the show ’s most popular episode .
House romped ahead of its closest rivals , CBS ’ CSI : Las Vegas ( 57.7 million ) and CSI : Miami ( 51.3 million ) .
Other hit U.S. exports included Buena Vista ’s Lost and Desperate Housewives .

Eric Boehlert makes an incredible point .
If you do n't think there 's a media double standard that favors Republicans over Democrats , then let 's play a game of what - if .
What if , in 2006 , at Yearly Kos , the first annual convention of liberal bloggers and their readers , organizers shelled out $ 100,000 for former Vice President Al Gore to address attendees ?
And what if the same organizers booked as an opening - night speaker a fringe , radical - left conspiracy theorist who'd spent the previous year pushing the thoroughly debunked claim that some Bush White administration insiders played a role in , and even planned , the 9 - 11 attacks .
What if the speaker ( also proudly anti-Semitic ) received a standing ovation from the liberal Yearly Kos crowd ?
Given that backdrop , and given the fact that the 9 - 11 Truther nut had for weeks bragged about his chance to share the stage with Gore , do you think the press would have demanded that Gore justify his association with a hateful conference that embraced a 9 - 11 Truther ?
Do you think pundits would have universally mocked and ridiculed Gore 's judgment while condemning the Yearly Kos convention as being a hothouse of left - wing hate ?
Do you think Gore 's appearance would have become a thing ?
I sure do .
Gore and liberal bloggers would have been crucified by the press and the D.C. chattering class if the scenario I described ever unfolded in real life .
( FYI , it goes without saying that organizers for Yearly Kos , now known as Netroots Nation , would never dream of mainstreaming an anti-Semitic 9 - 11 Truther via a prime - time speaking gig . )
But this past weekend in Nashville , at the first National Tea Party Convention , the Beltway press did just the opposite with regard to Sarah Palin 's keynote address , which did follow a prime - time speech by " birther " nut Joseph Farah , who over the years has carved out a uniquely hateful and demented corner of the right - wing blogosphere .
Because , yes , at the Tea Party convention , Farah , a proud Muslim - hater and gay - hater , did receive a standing ovation from the conservative crowd after he unfurled his thoroughly debunked birther garbage .
( i.e. Obama " does n't have a birth certificate . " )
And Farah did brag in the weeks leading up to the event about his chance to share the stage with Palin , to associate with Palin .
( " Sold out !
Palin - Farah ticket rocks tea- party convention , " read the headline at Farah 's discredited right - wing site , WorldNetDaily.com . )
Worst of all , though , the press played dumb about the whole thing .
Fact : Virtually nobody in the corporate media said boo about Palin helping to legitimize Farah by sharing the same stage with him .
She was given a total free ride .
And I mean nobody .
According to Nexis , there were more than 150 newspaper articles and columns published in the U.S. last week that mentioned both Palin and the Tea Party .
( Combined , The New York Times and The Washington Post published 18 of them . )
Yet out of all those articles and columns , exactly two also mentioned Joseph Farah by name .
( Congrats to the Philadelphia Daily News and New Hampshire 's Concord Monitor . )
When MoveOn held a video contest called Bush in 30 seconds and a Bush - Hitler video showed up and slipped through , the RNC and the media went ballistic .
Six months ago , MoveOn.org held a contest to find the best amateur ad against President Bush .
The group invited people to make ads and submit them to its
Web site .
Some idiot spliced images of Bush together with images of Adolf Hitler , evidently trying to make Bush look like a warmonger .
His submissions , which arrived with 1,500 others — too many to be screened quickly — were posted on the contest Web site .
As soon as MoveOn.org leaders realized what was in the ad , they removed and denounced it .
We 've seen hundreds of signs at Tea Party events that are racist and violent , but there never was an outcry from the media over them like there was over Move On , who did n't even produce it .
FOX News and others in the media ripped every Democratic politician who went to Yearly Kos back in 2006 .
And when many of the Democratic presidential nominees went to the same event in 2007 instead of the DLC convention , the criticism was abundant .
Why did n't Kristol rip his Quayle project ( Sarah Palin ) over making over 100K and speaking at the Tea Party convention ?
Well , that would never happen because conservatives can do no wrong .
Even if she did appear with the likes of a birther like Joseph Farah because he serves a purpose for the GOP .
Digby writes :
I do n't think there 's any doubt .
In fact , the first Yearly Kos got a lot of media attention and it featured some big names like Howard Dean and Harry Reid .
But the organizers did n't pay for any of them and there were no extremist cranks invited , so there was nothing to compel the huge hue and cry that would have been raised if they had done so .
It was , all in all , a pretty staid affair , with the only controversy surrounding the fact that Mark Warner paid 50 k for a party --- which was roundly criticized by the participants as gilding the lily .
Considering what would have been a feeding frenzy if the netroots had done something similar , Boehlert goes on to wonder why the mainstream press did n't bother to report the fact that Sarah Palin , whose speech was broadcast live on television , followed a prime time speech by " birther " fruitcake Joseph Farah .
By the way , here 's some of the highlights that Farah came away with at the tea party convention .
It 's very scary stuff .
If the media was actually covering the convention then why did they ignore this garbage ?
Innis & Gunn wants a foothold in the lucrative US beer market
The Edinburgh - based independent brewer , Innis & Gunn , has set up a new company to lead its drive into the US .
The new firm will distribute and market the brewer 's range in America .
Currently , the US accounts for 3 % of Innis & Gunn 's sales , and the company said the potential in America was " enormous " .
Innis & Gunn is the best selling British bottled beer in Canada and the brewer said response from US consumers to date had been extremely positive .
Dan DeLuca from International Beverage has been appointed as the the managing director of Innis & Gunn USA .
' Perfect man '
Dougal Sharp , managing director of Innis & Gunn Brewing Company , said : " Gaining a strong foothold in the US is an integral part of our growth strategy as we look to write the next chapter in Innis & Gunn 's success story .
" The market conditions are perfect , the product is perfect and now we have the perfect man in the job to lead the new set - up .
Dan 's track record speaks for itself and we 're thrilled to have him as part of the team . "
The " craft " or speciality category makes up 16 % of US beer sales and the Edinburgh brewer said it was keen to be a part of that growing market .
Innis & Gunn was set up in 2003 as a joint venture with the drinks firm , William Grant .
In 2008 there was a management buy - out and the business is now under family ownership .
An urban mystery unfurls as one man pieces together the surreal meaning of hundreds of cryptic tiled messages that have been appearing in city streets across the U.S. and South America .

A female trainer was killed today at SeaWorld 's Shamu Stadium in Orlando , Fla. , by a 12,000 - pound killer whale that had twice before been involved in the deaths of humans , according to police and local media .
Dawn Brancheau , 40 , an experienced trainer at the tourist attraction , was pulled into the tank by the killer whale , Chuck Tompkins , head of animal training at all SeaWorld parks , said this evening .
Tompkins told ABC News Orlando affiliate WFTV that Brancheau was rubbing down the whale after an afternoon show , when the incident occurred .
" She was pulled in and she drowned , " he said .
Earlier , police had said Brancheau slipped or fell into a tank holding the killer whale , Tillikum , and witnesses described the animal coming to the surface to attack the woman .
" Brancheau was pronounced dead at the park after being recovered from the pool .
Orange County Sheriff 's
Office homicide investigators continue to investigate the death of the trainer who was reported to have 16 years of experience working with killer whales , " the Orange County Sheriff 's Office said in an e-mailed release .
Tillikum , a male or bull whale , has lived at the park since 1992 , and is one of eight killer whales there .
" Currently , deputies with the full cooperation of SeaWorld have secured the scene and homicide detectives have been requested to respond and conduct a death investigation follow - up , along with our forensics unit , " said Capt .
Angelo Nieves of the Orange County Sheriff 's Office in a statement .
One witness , park visitor Victoria Biniak , told WKMG - TV that she watched the whale grab Brancheau .
" He was thrashing her around pretty good .
It was violent , " Biniak said .
The whale " took off really fast in the tank , and then he came back , shot up in the air , grabbed the trainer by the waist and started thrashing around , and one of her shoes flew off , " she said .
Visitors were evacuated and the park closed following the attack .
In a news conference shortly after the attack , police said Brancheau had fallen into the tank .
" We had a female trainer back in the whale holding area .
She apparently slipped or fell into the tank and was fatally injured by one of the whales , " said Jim Solomons of the Orange County Sheriff 's Office .
He added there was no evidence of " foul play . "
Dan Brown , vice president and general manager of SeaWorld Orlando , called Brancheau one of the park 's " most experienced trainers . "
" It is with great sadness that I report that one of our most experienced animal trainers drowned in an incident with one of our killer whales this afternoon , " said Brown .
" We have never , in the history of our parks , experienced an incident like this , " he said .
" We extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the trainer and will do everything possible to assist them in this difficult time . "
Tillikum 's Previous Attacks
Tillikum has been involved twice before in human deaths .
In 1991 , trainer Keltie Lee Byrne fell into a tank holding Tillikum and two other whales at Sealand of the Pacific in Victoria , Canada .
A homicide inquest found that the whales had prevented Byrne from climbing out of the tank and ruled her death an accident .
After being transferred to SeaWorld in Orlando , Tillikum again was connected to the death of a person in 1999 .
The body of Daniel Dukes , 27 , was found naked , draped across the giant whale 's body in July 1999 .
Dukes reportedly got past security at SeaWorld , remaining in the park after it had closed .
Wearing only his underwear , Dukes either jumped , fell or was pulled into the frigid water of Tillikum 's huge tank .
An autopsy ruled that he died of hypothermia in the 50 - degree water .
Dukes ' parents filed a lawsuit against the park later that year , but later withdrew it .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
EL PASO , Texas , Feb. 11 ( UPI ) -- U.S. authorities said they discovered 30 pounds of marijuana hidden in framed pictures of Jesus Christ being taken across the border from Mexico to Texas .
Agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the pictures were in the vehicle of a 22 - year - old woman from Juarez , Mexico , who was attempting to cross the border into El Paso , Texas , CNN reported Thursday .

" This is not the first time we have seen smugglers attempt to use religious figures and articles of faith to further their criminal enterprise , " said William Molaski , port director of the agency 's El Paso office .
" What some might find offensive or sacrilegious has unfortunately become a standard operating procedure for drug smugglers .
This would include using religious symbols , children and senior citizens in their attempts to defeat the CBP inspection process , " he said .
Molaski said the woman was arrested .
We are not supposed to speak ill of the dead .
But those whom the deceased viciously smeared and humiliated deserve to be defended .
Entrenched Rep. John Murtha passed away on Feb. 8 after a botched gallbladder surgery .
He has been hailed as a “ military advocate ” ( Associated Press ) and “ one of the greatest patriots ever to serve in Congress ” ( former Rep. Harold Ford Jr. ) .
These obsequious obituaries leave out inconvenient truths : John “ Jack ” Murtha was an unrepentant smear merchant and corruptocrat to the bitter end .
In May 2006 , during an MSNBC appearance that Marines and their families will never forget or forgive , Murtha accused US troops of wantonly killing some two dozen civilians , including children , in the terrorist stronghold of Haditha , Iraq .
Bellowed Murtha : “ Our troops overreacted because of the pressure on them , and they killed innocent civilians in cold blood . ”
He publicly indicted the Marines before military investigations had been completed .
His remarks opened military - bashing floodgates around the world .
In the wake of Murtha ’s reckless blabbing , MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann accused the Haditha Marines of “ willful targeted brutality . ”
The Nation magazine claimed that “ members of the 3rd Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment perpetrated a massacre . ”
The New York Times dubbed Haditha the “ defining atrocity ” of the Iraq war .
International papers piled on with Vietnam - era “ My Lai ” allusions .
Murtha cold - bloodedly sat back and enjoyed the ride while the Marines were left twisting in the wind .
By 2008 , seven of the Marines charged in the incident had been exonerated or had charges against them dropped .
One still awaits a long , dragged - out trial this year .
Murtha , the so - called “ military advocate , ” went to his deathbed refusing to apologize or retract the attacks on the Haditha Marines ( several of whom unsuccessfully sued him for libel to restore their honor ) .
Decent people would call this intransigent treachery .
The big - mouthed lawmaker treated his own constituents with trademark contempt .
During his last congressional campaign , he mocked voters in his district as bigots .
“ There ’s no question that western Pennsylvania is a racist area , ” he told the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette .
Responding to mounting criticism on both sides of the aisle about his logrolling orgies on the Hill , he sniffed : “ If I ’m corrupt , it ’s because I take care of my district . ”
First , foremost and forever , Jack Murtha took care of Jack Murtha .
The glowing encomiums from his liberal colleagues have glossed over the 19 - term Democrat ’s defining moment of political self - service .
In 1980 , Murtha was an unindicted co-conspirator in a massive bribery probe — in which undercover FBI agents videotaped Murtha entertaining a $ 50,000 bribe from agents posing as emissaries for Arab sheiks trying to enter our country illegally .
From transcripts of those conversations published by the late newspaper columnist Jack Anderson , Murtha ’s true colors shined :
“ I want to deal with you guys awhile be fore I make any transactions at all , period .
. . .
After we ’ve done some business , well , then I might change my mind .
. . . ”
“ I ’m going to tell you this .
If anybody can do it — I ’m not B.S. - ing you fellows — I can get it done my way , ” he boasted .
“ There ’s no question about it . ”
Murtha worried not about his integrity or how his constituents might be harmed , but about getting ratted out :
“ All at once , ” he said , “ some dumb ( ex pletive deleted ) would go start talking eight years from now about this whole thing and say ( expletive deleted ) , this happened .
Then in order to get immunity so he does n’t go to jail , he starts talking and fingering people .
So the ( S.O.B. ) falls apart . ”
“ You give us the banks where you want the money depos ited , ” offered one of the bag men .
“ All right , ” agreed Murtha .
“ How much money we talking about ? ”
“ Well , you tell me . ”
By the time of his death , Murtha had been caught intervening on behalf of a law - breaking Pennsylvania company convicted of selling military equipment parts illegally overseas ; had steered unprecedented billions in federal earmarks to friends , family and donors ; had earned multiple “ most corrupt in Congress ” designations from both the left - leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the right - leaning Judicial Watch ; and had remained intimately tied to PMA Group , a former lobbying firm under federal investigation , and Kuchera Industries , a defense contractor also under federal investigation .
From his character assassination of innocents to his insatiable appetite for pork and power , Jack Murtha embodied everything that is wrong with Washington .
If only the culture of corruption he serviced could be buried six feet under with him .
The Australian government found itself victim of a cyberattack on Wednesday morning as a protest against the government 's plan to begin filtering certain types of pornography from being accessed online .
The attack was carried out by the group Anonymous ( yes , that Anonymous ) as part of " Operation : Titstorm , " an effort to push back on Australia for including a plethora of perfectly legal content as part of its Internet filtering initiative .
Two government sites were taken down temporarily , and officials have ( unsurprisingly ) condemned the attacks .
The denial of service attacks began at 8 am Australian Time Wednesday morning ( 5 pm Eastern Time Tuesday night ) and targeted the Australian government 's main website as well as the Parliament site .
The plan was DDoS government servers first , and then follow up with " a s*** storm " of porn - related e-mails , faxes , and prank cell phone calls to government officials , with a special focus on three types of content that has fallen under the ban : small - breasted porn , cartoon porn , and female ejaculation .
( Australia 's Classification Board had previously determined female ejaculation to be a form of urination , while small - breasted women simply " appeared " to be underage . )
" The Australian government will learn that one does not mess with our porn , " someone wrote on behalf of Anonymous in an e-mail sent to media outlets .
" No one messes with our access to perfectly legal ( or illegal ) content for any reason . "
Australia has been under heavy criticism for its plan to filter pornographic content since it began discussing the proposal in 2007 .
Despite the fact that its own government - funded studies have shown that ISP level filtering wo n't work , the government forged ahead , even throwing perfectly legal — if not a little gross — content into the mix .
Most of the legal - but - objectionable content falls under the government 's optional filter ( there is also a required blacklist that is short and specific ) , but whether or not to implement the second blacklist is a decision made at the ISP level .
Australia 's Department of Parliamentary Services confirmed with the Sydney Morning Herald that the parliament site was getting up to 7.5 million hits per second at its peak .
The spokesperson said that the site was inaccessible for about an hour and then intermittent for several hours after that .
A spokesperson for Communications Minister Stephen Conroy added that the attacks were " totally irresponsible " and could have denied services to the Australian public .
Somehow , we get the feeling that Anonymous does n't care much about what the Communications Minister thinks is " responsible . "
Still , other groups that oppose Australia 's filtering plan also condemned the attack : Stop Internet Censorship cofounder Nicholas Perkins said the action brought negative attention to the issue .
" It would be much more helpful for these people to put their efforts behind legitimate action to stop this ineffective and inefficient attempt at censorship by the Australian government , " Perkins said in a statement .
( Health.com ) --
People who take antidepressants such as Paxil often say they feel less stressed and more outgoing , lively , and confident .
Now a new study suggests it 's not just because they 're less depressed .
In fact , such drugs may alter two key personality traits linked to depression -- neuroticism and extraversion -- independently of their effect on depression symptoms .
" Medication can definitely change people 's personalities , and change them quite substantially , " says the lead author of the study , Tony Z. Tang , Ph.D. , a professor of psychology at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois .
The findings show that " those changes are very important , " he says .
In the study , people who took Paxil ( paroxetine ) , a selective serotonin - reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , had a drop in neuroticism , which is a tendency toward emotional instability and negative mood .
They also had an increase in extraversion , which is a tendency toward outgoingness , compared to similarly depressed people taking placebo .
And the more drastic the personality shift , the less likely depressed patients were to relapse , according to the study , published this week in the Archives of General Psychiatry .

How to cope with mental illness during the holidays
Paxil is rarely prescribed now , because of concerns about side effects and withdrawal , says Tang , but other SSRIs ( such as Prozac and Zoloft ) are likely to have the same effect on personality .
Expert Q & A : Your mental health questions answered
The notion that antidepressant drugs -- and SSRIs in particular -- can cause personality changes is not new .
But many researchers have attributed these changes to a patient 's improved mood , and have been skeptical that SSRIs had independent effects on personality .
Health.com : " Antidepressants helped my fibromyalgia "
The current research is a " confirmation of what I observed a number of years ago , " says psychiatrist Peter D. Kramer , M.D. , the author of the landmark 1993 book " Listening to Prozac , " which described how patients treated with antidepressants often became more at ease socially and less sensitive to rejection .
" It looks like a lot of what gives people relief is that they 're feeling whatever the opposite of neuroticism is , " says Kramer , a clinical professor of psychology and human behavior at Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island .
" Getting better very solidly seems to predict a longer period before the next episode .
That argues against the notion that these medications are just band - aids [ that ] get people through . "
Health.com : Depression in bipolar disorder
Psychiatrists have come to expect personality changes in patients being treated with SSRIs , says Kramer .
Thirty years ago , he says , a person who was " no longer in acute pain , remained pessimistic and socially shy and socially anxious and feeling inferior " was considered cured of depression .
Today , he says , " Clinical people now want to see these personality changes . "
In Listening to Prozac , Kramer expressed concern that SSRIs might usher in an era of " cosmetic psychopharmacology , " with non-depressed people popping pills to make themselves more attractive , energetic , and confident .
But this has n't come to pass , he says .
" I 've never had anyone come into my office or ever had an extended phone conversation with someone who was on these medications for trivial reasons . "

How the right drugs can treat bipolar disorder
Although the new study sheds some light on the relationship between SSRIs and personality , there is much that remains unknown about these drugs .
" The theory of how these medications work is actually still a mystery , " says Tang .
In the study , the researchers randomly assigned 240 people with moderate to severe depression to Paxil , placebo , or cognitive therapy ( a form of talk therapy ) .
In order to separate out the effect of Paxil and depressive symptoms on personality , the researchers matched participants in the Paxil and placebo groups according to how much their symptoms improved .

After eight weeks , the group of patients who took Paxil reported a reduction in neuroticism nearly seven times greater than that reported by the patients taking placebo whose depression symptoms had improved a comparable amount .
The increase in extraversion reported by the Paxil group was 3.5 times greater than that among the matched placebo patients .
( The changes in personality were measured using a standard questionnaire . )
The study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health .
GlaxoSmithKline , the maker of Paxil , provided the medication and placebo pills .

Sikhs should be allowed to wear their ceremonial daggers - known as Kirpans - to school and other public places , Britain 's first Asian judge has said .
There have been a number of cases of Sikhs being refused entry to venues because they wear the Kirpan or other religious artefacts .
Sir Mota Singh QC , who is retired , has criticised schools over the issue .
" Not allowing someone who is baptised to wear a Kirpan is not right , " Sir Mota told BBC Asian Network .
' No objection ' Last year , a Sikh police officer , who had been told to remove his turban during riot training , won a discrimination case against Greater Manchester Police .
A schoolboy was also banned from wearing his Kirpan at the Compton School in Barnet , north London .
The kirpan is one of five ' articles of faith '
Sikhs must carry And , in 2008 , 14 - year - old Sarika Singh won a High Court case against her school after it excluded her for breaking its " no jewellery " rule for wearing a Kara ( steel bangle ) , which is another symbol of Sikh faith .
The school was found guilty of indirect discrimination under race relations and equality laws .
" I see no objection to a young Sikh girl or boy , who 's been baptised , being allowed to wear their Kirpan if that 's what they want to do , " said Sir Mota , who received a knighthood in the 2010 New Year Honours list .
" I wear my Kirpan and I 've always worn it for the last 35 to 40 years , even when I was sitting in court or visiting public buildings , including Buckingham Palace . "
Sir Mota , who is now retired , added : " I think these are issues that can be dealt with with a certain amount of sensitivity .
" The girl not allowed to wear the Kara is a petty thing for the administrators to have done and it does n't do them any good .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It may be part of the Sikh faith but at the end of the day the Kirpan is still a knife Anon , Glasgow " It is the right of every young girl and boy to be educated at the school of their choice .
For him or her to be refused admission on that sort of ground , as far as I 'm concerned , is quite wrong .
" It ought not to happen but it does .
I think it 's wrong to be discriminated against for that reason . "
The Compton School offered the boy the option of wearing a smaller knife , welded into a metal sheath , but his parents refused and withdrew him - an action by the family that Sir Mota said he supported .
He later told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : " But on the other hand , I am also conscious of the health and safety position .
" I accept that , because I think as one realises the increase in crimes of violence involving the use of knives and other offensive weapons , I can see that .
" But there has been no reported case , certainly none that I know of , of a Sikh using a knife in order to cause injury . "
' Worn discreetly '
Asked about the possibility of substituting a smaller knife in place of the traditional Kirpan , the judge said that might be an option for debate between school and Sikh authorities .
But he told Today : " It 's a little more than ceremonial .
It 's a requirement of the religion . "
There have been problems for Sikhs going to tourist attractions
Dabinderjit Singh
Adviser to Sikh Federation UK
Have your say on the Kirpan Kirpan ' is part of the body '
In Sikhism , the Kirpan and Kara are two of the five " articles of faith " that must be carried at all times by baptised Sikhs .
The others are Kesh ( unshorn hair ) , Kara , Kanga ( comb ) and Kacha ( special underwear ) .
The Kirpan is carried in a sheath attached to a cloth belt .
It is normally worn discreetly under clothes and most people would be unaware that a person was carrying one .
Guidelines from the department for Children , Schools and Families indicate it is up to individual governing bodies to make their own policy on the carrying of the Kirpan , and if challenged , it would then be up to the courts .
Dabinderjit Singh is an adviser to the Sikh Federation UK and he says he regularly receives calls from worried Sikh parents whose children have been prevented from wearing the Kirpan at school and in public areas .
Although Sikhs carrying the Kirpan are exempt from prosecution under the offensive weapons act , Mr Singh believes objections about the ceremonial dagger have increased following the September 11 attacks and instances of knife crime .
" There have been problems for Sikhs going to tourist attractions , " he explained .
" Part of it is education .
" We 're actually working with the government to introduce a code of practice which would then be used to educate people in the security industry so they are aware of the different articles of faith , " Mr Singh told the BBC Asian Network .
Campaign groups such as United Sikhs and the Sikh Federation UK have welcomed Sir Mota 's comments over issues which the judge himself has not had to encounter during his career .
' No eyebrows raised ' Sir Mota was raised in Nairobi , Kenya , before coming to England in 1954 in order complete his studies in law .
He joined the English bar in 1967 and made headlines with his appointment to the bench in 1982 when he wore a white turban in court instead of a wig .
" The fact that I 'm a Sikh matters more to me than anything else , " he said .
" If , for instance , when I was appointed the suggestion had been made that I could not appear unless I wore a wig and discarded my turban , I would have refused .
" I would have said I would not accept the appointment , but the question never arose and no judicial eyebrows were raised at all . "

TORONTO , Canada — Last Sunday , Canada commemorated the 20th anniversary of a massacre that haunts us still .
In 1989 , a young man named Marc Lepine walked into the engineering school of the University of Montreal armed with a semi-automatic hunting rifle .
He stalked its cafeteria and classrooms shouting , “ I hate feminists , ” and coldly separated the men from the women .
By the time he turned the gun on himself , 14 people lay murdered — all of them women .
The killing spree traumatized the nation .
It was a decade before the Columbine high school shootings in the United States .
Yet it brought home a level of gun violence many naively thought was the reserve of neighbors south of the border .
Worse , it could n’t be dismissed as the act of a deranged man who randomly opened fire .
This was a killer who targeted women .
First came a period of mournful soul - searching .
Then came a period of activism .
There were marches to protest violence against women , and to denounce the glass ceilings that restrict the number of women in politics , top business jobs and elsewhere .
And there was sustained pressure to toughen gun laws , some if it led by the Montreal women who survived the massacre .
The Liberal government of the day reacted by setting up the “ long - gun registry , ” a centralized system whereby owners of rifles and shotguns have to register their weapons .
With an estimated 1.9 million Canadians owning guns , its implementation took a decade and cost $ 2 billion .
The gun registry is strongly backed by police chiefs across the country .
Police officers like to know , when they ’re responding to a call , if there ’s a gun in the house .
It helps protect them .
They can also seize the weapons in cases of domestic disputes .
And , it helps track the provenance of rifles , particularly when they ’re stolen from homes and used in crimes .
Police used the registry 2.5 million times in 2007 .
The registry is also about violence against women .
Rifles or shotguns are used in most murders committed in the home during incidents of domestic violence .
And most of these victims are women .
The registry , however , has long been opposed by many who live in rural areas of Canada .
They question its value in restricting gun crime and insist it treats law - abiding farmers and hunters like criminals .
These same people , bizarrely , do n’t complain about having to register their vehicles .
Rural Canada is the power base of the Conservative Party .
So when the party formed its first minority government in 2006 , Prime Minister Stephen Harper immediately set about undermining the long - gun registry .
He granted new owners of rifles and shotguns an “ amnesty ” — they did n’t have to register them .
It also waived fees for people renewing gun licenses .
The message gun owners came away with is that they need not bother with either the gun registry or licenses .
In October , Canada ’s national police , the RCMP , said 138,000 Canadians had let their gun licenses expire .
Of those , half had moved without notifying registry authorities of their new address .
In other words , every year police lose track of tens of thousands of guns .
Last month , the Harper government went further .
It let a Conservative member of Parliament propose a law that would abolish the long - gun registry once and for all .
It would also destroy the files of 7 million previously registered rifles and shotguns .
The bill would not affect handguns , which would continue to be registered .
And illegal weapons , such as assault rifles and sawed - off shotguns , would still be banned .
The bill was a cunning move .
Laws proposed by the government are subject to party discipline , which means MPs must vote the party line .
With the three opposition parties officially in favor of keeping the long - gun registry , any bill sponsored by Harper ’s minority government would have been defeated .
But bills proposed by individual MPs — such as the one to abolish the gun registry — are traditionally allowed a “ free vote . ”
Politicians can break from party policy and vote as they like .
That put the pressure on several opposition MPs that represent rural ridings .
The Conservative party increased the pressure with radio attack ads targeting the most vulnerable MPs .
Several Liberal and New Democratic party MPs caved in and supported the bill to abolish the registry , allowing it to pass an important vote that leaves it just two more votes away from becoming law .
Heidi Rathjen , one of the survivors of the Montreal massacre , described the proposed law as a “ slap in the face ” to all victims of gun crimes .
The vote on the bill highlighted the rural - urban divide in Canada politics , one that has shut out the Conservative party from almost all urban ridings .
It also revealed what some describe as the Harper government ’s blatant hypocrisy .
At every turn , Harper vaunts his government ’s law - and - order agenda .
Inspired by American methods of fighting crime that have proved ineffective , he has passed laws that set the minimum amount of prison time judges can impose for a series of crimes , and is considering spending billions of dollars on the building of massive prison compounds .
But tough on crime apparently does n’t mean vigilance about rifles and shotguns .
All week long in the foyer of the House of Commons , the government paid tribute to the victims of the Montreal massacre with a vase of 14 white roses , one for each woman killed .
But with the government ’s efforts to abolish the long - gun registry , many could n’t help but see it as an empty gesture .

China to continue One Child Policy By By Wang Fangqing Jan 20 , 2010 in World Despite the fact China is facing population challenges such as fast aging and sex ratio imbalance , the country will continue its low - birth policy , said Li Keqiang , Vice Premier of China .
Only 200 million people were born from 1989 to 2005 , the year the nation 's population reached 1.3 billion .
The Chinese government said the achievement should be attributed to the One Child policy , without which the population would be more than 1.7 billion , estimated the government .
Under the policy , which was introduced in 1978 , urban couples can only have one child while rural couples are allowed to have two .
The policy , along with rapid industrialization and urbanization have also contributed to the growth of China 's aging society .
According to government statistics , the country 's birth rate dropped from more than 1.8 percent in 1978 to around 1.2 percent in 2007 .
The population over 60 years of age , however , increased by 50 million in the last 10 years .
By the end of 2008 there were 169 million people over 60 years old .
Meanwhile , rural couple are still obsessed with having a male heir , mainly because of China 's weak social welfare system .
Ultrasonic inspection is widely being used in hospitals in remote area for sex ratio selection .
A recent In early January , the central government said it would accelerate the legislation to prevent gender selection .
China is facing the pressure of population growth and the country 's aggressive development over the past three decades has raised new challenges , Li told authorities at the National Population and Family Planning Commission today , reports Xinhua Only 200 million people were born from 1989 to 2005 , the year the nation 's population reached 1.3 billion .

Walmart is redesigning its stores to mimic its app .
This is what they 'll look like
So , in The Beginning , when I was just a young padawan on the Internet , I had been let into a glorious secret : Emulation ( not of IBM System / 360 machines , but of more important things like the Super NES ) .
Some branching from there led me to zophar.net , a popular emulation site , and their message boards , and also left me with a fascination with emulation .
The attributes of some of the older systems like the NES and Super NES made it fairly easy to capture their music - producing software , since those systems used separate co-processors to handle music effects .
NES music would be stored in the NSF format , and SNES music was handled with the SPC format ( named after the audio chip used , the Sony SPC700 ) .
There were ( and still are ) specialized plugins on many systems to play these formats ( they emulated only the music chip , not the rest of the system ) .
I ’ve been involved on the periphery of some of these things for the past couple of years .
( For instance I had written a KFileMetaInfo plugin for KDE 3 , and had helped Chris Lee with adding playback support to GStreamer .
One problem with the previous GStreamer solution ( which I ’ll call gst - spc ) is that the underlying playback library , libopenspc , is written in x86 assembly , and has some crash bugs associated with it as well .
As well the code has long been orphaned .
I ’m not really any good at writing emulation code and although I could learn , it would take far too much time for me to do anything useful .
Luckily for me the state of the art has advanced and last year I was pointed to a library called game - music - emu .
This library included a very good SPC emulator written in C++ , which had been merged into some popular SNES emulators already .
Unfortunately it did n’t really have a great build system ( using it involved simply copying it into your existing program ) so my initial proposal to port GStreamer to use game - music - emu by simply including the source files with GStreamer was rejected .
The GStreamer devs preferred to have an external library which could be used ( or not ) and I could n’t blame them since in general good OSS projects avoid copying or forking external code .
So I contacted the game - music - emu author ( Blargg ) asking about the possibility of adding support for building a library , and ended up with commit access and an invitation to do it myself .
Hmm .
So I did , and awhile ago I had made a release of “ libgme ” 0.5.5 , working with Blargg has he got free time .
My subsequent patch to GStreamer was accepted and since gst-plugins - bad - 0.10.14 it has been possible to use libgme to playback many emulated music file types ( not just SNES , but others as well ) .
With that solved I left the issue , but I recently came back to it since I figured out that even after upgrading to gst- plugins - bad - 0.10.17 the other day , that gstreamer playback was not using libgme , but the older libopenspc .
At first I thought it was simply my fault , as I ’d still had gst - spc installed from years and years ago .
Removing gst-spc and libopenspc ( just to be double - sure ) left me with no SPC playback features .
Running gst - inspect confirmed I did not have any gme decoder .
WTF .
I then again thought it was my fault because I had installed libgme to /usr / local instead of /usr .
So I dutifully wrapped up libgme in an ebuild and installed it .
And still nothing .
WTF .
I dug into the Gentoo ebuild for gst- plugins - bad and it seems that for whatever reason not all possible plugins are installed .
It seems the new installation method is supposed to be that each individual plugin is supposed to have its own ebuild ( i.e. gst- plugins - gme ) , like how Gentoo has split out other packages like KDE into individual ebuilds .
Fair enough .
I write another ebuild , and finally hit paydirt :
The Qt example music player playing SPC files
Obviously this does require that you are using the GStreamer backend for Phonon to have this work , otherwise you can just try it in some other GStreamer - using application .
( I ’d show it in JuK but I ’d have to add SPC support to Taglib first )
If you ’re interested in the ebuilds I used you can use this Portage overlay , ( SHA - 512 sum c0ff9aa5413b0c0b14f7c52d5b3ee887edc4e7bf47182e58c21e9c340d8ff7e9 ) .
The overlay may or may not work for you , and I do n’t even know if overlays are still the “ hip ” way to do things in Gentoo , but It Works For Me. ;)
Weather Is Not Climate
Cooler Weather and Fewer Hurricanes Do Not Lessen Global Warming Trends , Say Scientists
" Choosing shorts or long underwear on a particular day is about weather ; the ratio of shorts to long underwear in the drawer is about climate . "
-- Charles Wohlforth , " The Whale and the Supercomputer "
You probably noticed there were fewer Atlantic hurricanes this year .
Melting Arctic sea ice came extremely close to but did n't break the record minimum of summer 2005 .
And today , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , or NOAA , announced two months of cooler - than - average temperatures across the United States .
So what happened to global warming ?
Scientists who study climate say they get that question every time there 's a cold spell .
Their answer :
It 's important to keep in mind an important concept .
Weather is not climate .
Weather , as we all know , is what we see in the day - to - day , often unpredictable fluctuations in local temperature , humidity , precipitation and wind .
" The fact that we had a couple of cool months does n't say anything at all about long - term trends , " said Mark Serreze , a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center .
" It 's just a clear example of natural variability on the climate system .
The long - term averages are decidedly toward a warming planet . "
Kevin Trenberth , a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , agreed .
" Weather is chaotic .
It has an infinite amount of variability , and that 's just the nature of weather , " he said .
" Weather dominates on a day - to - day basis , and there will be warmer period and cooler periods .
But it 's the overall pattern that gives you the climate . "
And that , said climate scientists , means the occasional cold snap is not inconsistent with global warming , just as a heat wave may not by itself indicate global warming .
Temperatures
Long - term trends in the data tell scientists that the planet is getting warmer .
Weather events that suggest otherwise are to be expected , they said .
" We have a gradual warming of Earth 's system , but that is interspersed with a strong natural variability in the system , " Serreze said .
" This is just the way the system works . "
Scientists also note that the five - warmest annual temperatures in the last century have all occurred in the last eight years .
NOAA said today that globally , temperatures for October are well above average , and the month was the fourth warmest on record .
The average global temperature has risen by about one degree Fahrenheit over the past century .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which represents hundreds of scientists studying climate change in the United States and worldwide , predicted future temperature increases this century of anywhere from two degrees to eight degrees .
Hurricanes
Short - term variability also helps explain the dramatic difference between recent hurricane seasons .
In 2005 , for example , there were a record 27 named storms during the North Atlantic hurricane season , including Katrina , Rita and Wilma .
The 2006 season , while an average season , was much quieter , and no storms hit the U.S. coast .
The Pacific , on the other hand , has seen an intense hurricane season .
Typhoon Saomai , a Category 4 storm with sustained winds up to 150 miles per hour , drove half a million Chinese inland , caused massive flooding , and left 900 fishing boats lost at sea .
No one knows how many people were killed .
Hurricane Sergio , which is not threatening land , is currently churning across the Pacific and is the 19th named storm of the season .
Chalk it up to natural fluctuations in weather patterns , said Trenberth .
In this case , the cause is the periodic warming and cooling cycles in the Pacific Ocean known as El Niño and La Niña .
In the winter of 2004 - 2005 , warmer water temperatures brought on by a weak El Niño meant lighter winds and sunny skies in the tropical Atlantic , where hurricanes form .
" The sun was beating down .
There was less heat energy being sucked out by trade winds , " said Trenberth .
" The water warmed up and that set the stage for the 2005 season . "
But this season the opposite occurred .
A La Niña cooling of the Pacific Ocean led to stronger trade winds that pulled more heat energy out of the ocean while also helping prevent hurricane - strength winds from forming .
Cloudier skies meant the sun did n't heat the oceans as much .
" There was very little heat in the ocean " compared with 2005 , Trenberth said .
Despite the natural fluctuations , a growing body of scientific research argues that human - induced global warming is having an increasing effect on the intensity of hurricanes .
Scientists said it is difficult to predict just how future hurricane seasons will stack up , but according to a 2005 study by scientists at Georgia Tech University and the National Center for Atmospheric Research , the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes -- packing winds up to 155 miles an hour -- has doubled in the past 35 years .
Ice
Up in the Arctic , the amount of summer sea ice that melted in the summer of 2006 may not have broken the record set in 2005 , but that does n't necessarily mean good news , Serreze said .
Throughout the early summer , for example , the amount of sea ice was well below the 2005 record .
An unusually cooler , cloudy August that reflected the sun 's energy away from the ice helped reverse the steady downward trend .
The big picture , researchers said , shows that Arctic sea ice is " sharply declining " and has melted back at almost 10 percent per decade over the last 30 years .
If that trend continues , some scientists believe the Arctic could be completely ice free by 2060 .
" In terms of the long - term trends in the Arctic sea ice cover , I 'm certainly pessimistic , " Serreze said .
We 'll still need weather forecasters in coming decades , said scientists , to tell us how tomorrow will be different from today .
Even as Earth 's overall temperature -- its climate -- gets warmer and warmer .
Why not ?
Everyone loves it when our crazy comments page numbers thing kicks in .
Ubisoft have taken their senses and posted them into outer space .
Responding to the public outcry for more draconian , inconveniencing copyright management , they have replaced Starforce and announced their new PC - only DRM system .
One that requires you be permanently online in order to be able to play .
The attempt to sell this new system begins with what it does n’t do .
There ’s no CD check , and there ’s no installation limits .
A good start .
And then , GameSpy reports enthusiastically , it will support cloud saving .
Well , I love cloud saving – it ’s something Valve promised ages ago ( although with sadly little movement since ) .
When I choose to use it .
Which with this DRM , the current reports suggest , you cannot .
The price we pay for not requiring the CD in the drive , and for being able to install a game we ’ve legally bought on as many machines as we want , is to be permanently online when playing Ubi games .
It will authenticate itself online each time you load it , and then save remotely every time you save .
This is , to stress , a game perhaps bought in a shop .
So from now on , beginning with Settlers 7 , potentially all Ubi PC games will require you to check in with them to let them know you ’ve started playing their game , and then tell them every time you save , send them all the data in doing so , and then say bye - bye when you ’re done playing for that day .
Shack News received some clarifying information from Ubisoft .
They explain that they will apply patches should they ever remove the servers behind the games .
They also explain that if your connection drops while playing , the game will pause while it tries to reconnect , and then will apparently allow you to carry on without the internet .
They do n’t say whether it will be impossible to save if you do , however .
They also say in the same notes that , “ you will need to have an active Internet connection to play the game , for all game modes . ”
So this is a little unclear .
This seems like such a bizarre , bewildering backward step .
Of course we have n’t experienced it yet , but based on Ubi ’s own description of the system so many concerns arise .
Yes , certainly , most people have the internet all the time on their PCs .
But not all people .
So already a percentage of the audience is lost .
Then comes those who own gaming laptops , who now will not be able to play games on trains , buses , in the park , or anywhere they may not be able to find a wifi connection ( something that ’s rarely free in the UK , of course – fancy paying the £ 10 / hour in the airport to play your Ubisoft game ? ) .
Then there ’s the day your internet is down , and the engineers ca n’t come out to fix it until tomorrow .
No game for you .
Or any of the dozens of other situations when the internet is not available to a player .
But further , there are people who do not wish to let a publisher know their private gaming habits .
People who do not wish to report in to a company they ’ve no affiliation with , nor accountability to , whenever they play a game they ’ve legally bought .
People who do n’t want their save data stored remotely .
This new system renders all customers beholden to Ubisoft in perpetuity whenever they buy their games .
Clearly publishers are terrified by piracy .
While none of the major publishers has ever produced any evidence to support the claims that piracy decreases their sales , they clearly think it does , and are trying to do anything they can to prevent it .
Their ultimate goal – to make more money from sales – is in our favour too , of course .
We want more PC games , and we want them now .
So if publishers are n’t willing to invest in the medium because of piracy fears , we ’ll lose out in a big way .
But sadly these peculiar , Big Brother - esque approaches do not seem close to the right way to go about it .
Perhaps Ubi will react to public outcry .
Perhaps a more sensible version can be created , one that offers an offline mode for those who play games offline , as with Steam .
A solution that ’s designed to make games accessible to those who legally purchase them .
I really hope so .
Update : Just noticed two other things .
Firstly , this new DRM also prevents the option to resell your game .
There are implications here .
Secondly , this rather remarkable wording in the FAQ :
While Barack Obama was making his latest pitch for a brand new , even more unsustainable entitlement at the health care “ summit , ” thousands of Greeks took to the streets to riot .
An enterprising cable network might have shown the two scenes on a continuous split - screen – because they ’re part of the same story .
It ’s just that Greece is a little further along in the plot :
They ’re at the point where the canoe is about to plunge over the falls .
America is further upstream and can still pull for shore , but has decided , instead , that what it needs to do is catch up with the Greek canoe .
Chapter One ( the introduction of unsustainable entitlements ) leads eventually to Chapter 20 ( total societal collapse ) : The Greeks are at Chapter 17 or 18 .
What ’s happening in the developed world today is n’t so very hard to understand :
The 20th century Bismarckian welfare state has run out of people to stick it to .
In America , the feckless insatiable boobs in Washington , Sacramento , Albany and elsewhere are screwing over our kids and grandkids .
In Europe , they ’ve reached the next stage in social democratic evolution :
There are no kids or grandkids to screw over .
The United States has a fertility rate of around 2.1 – or just over two kids per couple .
Greece has a fertility rate of about 1.3 : 10 grandparents have six kids have four grandkids – i.e. , the family tree is upside down .
Demographers call 1.3 “ lowest - low ” fertility – the point from which no society has ever recovered .
And , compared with Spain and Italy , Greece has the least - worst fertility rate in Mediterranean Europe .
So you ca n’t borrow against the future because , in the most basic sense , you do n’t have one .
Greeks in the public sector retire at 58 , which sounds great .
But , when 10 grandparents have four grandchildren , who pays for you to spend the last third of your adult life loafing around ?
By the way , you do n’t have to go to Greece to experience Greek - style retirement : The Athenian “ public service ” of California has been metaphorically face down in the ouzo for a generation .
Still , America as a whole is not yet Greece .
A couple of years ago , when I wrote my book “ America Alone , ” I put the Social Security debate at that time in a bit of perspective :
On 2005 figures , projected public pensions liabilities were expected to rise by 2040 to about 6.8 percent of GDP .
In Greece , the figure was 25 percent : in other words , head for the hills , Armageddon outta here , The End .
Since then , the situation has worsened in both countries .
And , really , the comparison is academic : Whereas America still has a choice , Greece is n’t going to have a 2040 – not without a massive shot of Reality Juice .
Is that likely to happen ?
At such moments , I like to modify Gerald Ford .
When seeking to ingratiate himself with conservative audiences , President Ford liked to say : “ A government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take away everything you have . ”
Which is true enough .
But there ’s an intermediate stage : A government big enough to give you everything you want is n’t big enough to get you to give any of it back .
That ’s the point Greece is at .
Its socialist government has been forced into supporting a package of austerity measures .
The Greek people ’s response is : Nuts to that .
Public sector workers have succeeded in redefining time itself :
Every year , they receive 14 monthly payments .
You do the math .
And for about seven months ’ work : for many of them the work day ends at 2:30 p.m .
And , when they retire , they get 14 monthly pension payments .
In other words : Economic reality is not my problem .
I want my benefits .
And , if it bankrupts the entire state a generation from now , who cares as long as they keep the checks coming until I croak ?
We hard - hearted small - government guys are often damned as selfish types who care nothing for the general welfare .
But , as the Greek protests make plain , nothing makes an individual more selfish than the socially equitable communitarianism of big government :
Once a chap ’s enjoying the fruits of government health care , government - paid vacation , government - funded early retirement , and all the rest , he could n’t give a hoot about the general societal interest ; he ’s got his , and to hell with everyone else .
People ’s sense of entitlement endures long after the entitlement has ceased to make sense .
The perfect spokesman for the entitlement mentality is the Deputy Prime Minister of Greece .
The European Union has concluded that the Greek government ’s austerity measures are insufficient and , as a condition of bailout , has demanded something more robust .
Greece is no longer a sovereign state :
It ’s General Motors , and the EU is Washington , and the Greek electorate is happy to play the part of the UAW – everything ’s on the table except anything that would actually make a difference .
In practice , because Spain , Portugal , Italy and Ireland are also on the brink of the abyss , a “ European ” bailout will be paid for by Germany .
So the aforementioned Greek Deputy Prime Minister , Theodoros Pangalos , has denounced the conditions of the EU deal on the grounds that the Germans stole all the bullion from the Bank of Greece during the Second World War .
Welfare always breeds contempt , in nations as much as inner-city housing projects :
How dare you tell us how to live !
Just give us your money and push off .
Unfortunately , Germany is no longer an economic powerhouse .
As Angela Merkel pointed out a year ago , for Germany an Obama - sized stimulus was out of the question simply because its foreign creditors know there are not enough young Germans around ever to repay it .
Over 30 percent of German women are childless ; among German university graduates , it ’s over 40 percent .
And for the ever - dwindling band of young Germans who make it out of the maternity ward there ’s precious little reason to stick around .
Why be the last handsome blond lederhosen - clad Aryan lad working the late shift at the beer garden in order to prop up singlehandedly entire retirement homes ?
And that ’s before the EU decides to add the Greeks to your burdens .
Germans , who retire at 67 , are now expected to sustain the unsustainable 14 monthly payments per year of Greeks who retire at 58 .
Think of Greece as California : Every year an irresponsible and corrupt bureaucracy awards itself higher pay and better benefits paid for by an ever - shrinking wealth - generating class .
And think of Germany as one of the less - profligate , still - just - about - functioning corners of America such as my own state of New Hampshire : Responsibility does n’t pay .
You ’ll wind up bailing out , anyway .
The problem is there are never enough of “ the rich ” to fund the entitlement state , because in the end it disincentivizes everything from wealth creation to self - reliance to the basic survival instinct , as represented by the fertility rate .
In Greece , they ’ve run out Greeks , so they ’ll stick it to the Germans , like French farmers do .
In Germany , the Germans have only been able to afford to subsidize French farming because they stick Americans with their defense tab .
And , in America , Obama , Pelosi and Reid are saying we need to paddle faster to catch up with the Greeks and Germans .
What could go wrong ?

An Indian man is in hospital after being set on fire in the street in Melbourne early this morning .
Jaspreet Singh , 29 , was attacked in Essendon in Melbourne 's north - west shortly before 2.00 am ( AEDT ) .
He had just come home from a dinner party with his wife and went to park his car when four men poured fluid over him and set him alight .
He is in a stable condition in the Alfred Hospital with burns to 20 per cent of his body .
Police say the man is of Indian origin but they do not know whether he is an Australian citizen .
Friends say the man is living in the city on a spouse visa .
Detective acting senior sergeant Neil Smyth says it is not yet known who the four men could be or their relationship to the victim .
He says investigations indicate the attack was random .
" It 's unlikely to be a racially motivated incident as due to the timing and the nature , it 's highly unlikely anyone could have targeted the victim in the circumstances , " he said .
It has been a week since 21 - year - old Indian man Nitin Garg was stabbed to death on his way to work in West Footscray .
The murder has sparked outrage in India and among Indians in Melbourne , who say racist attacks are on the rise .
Gautam Gupta from the Federation of Indian Students of Australia says the attacks are unacceptable and the Federal Government must act .
" We are extremely disturbed , we have contacted the Prime Minister 's office and have suggested that they intervene , it 's high time they intervene , " he said .
" How many times are they going to just dodge this issue . "
Cartoon ' hysteria '
Today the editor of an Indian newspaper said Australia was reacting hysterically to a cartoon depicting an Australian police officer as a member of the Ku Klux Klan .
The cartoon shows a person in a Ku Klux Klan hood wearing a police badge , with a caption that reads : " We are yet to ascertain the nature of the crime " .
The editor of the Mail Today newspaper , Bharat Bhushan , has defended his decision to publish the controversial cartoon .
Mr Bhushan has also defended the paper 's cartoonist , R Prasad , who drew the piece in response to attacks on young Indian men in Melbourne .
" What he does is he exaggerates things , " Mr Bhushan said .
" He forces people to look at a particular point of view , which we had thought in a mature society like Australia would lead to introspection , rather it has led to hysteria . "
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard has expressed outrage at the cartoon 's Ku Klux Klan reference .
" Any suggestion of that kind is deeply , deeply offensive to the police officers involved and I would absolutely condemn the making of a comment like that , " Ms Gillard said .
" [ The police ] have indeed worked in close collaboration with representatives of the Indian community as they 've gone about this step up in policing . "
Ultimately , it appears , New York officials could not tolerate ceding much of the city to a set of trials that could last for years .
“ The administration is in a tricky political and legal position , ” Julie Menin , a lawyer who is chairwoman of the 50 - member Community Board 1 that represents Lower Manhattan , including the federal courthouse and ground zero , said of President Obama and his Justice Department .
“ But it means shutting down our financial district .
It could cost $ 1 billion .
It ’s absolutely crazy . ”
Ms. Menin said the turning point for her came when she heard Mr. Kelly ’s security plan and cost estimates : hundreds of millions of dollars a year .
“ It was an absolute game - changer , ” she said .
She wrote a Jan. 17 op - ed article for The New York Times proposing moving the trial to Governors Island off Manhattan ; that idea did not catch hold , but the article escalated the outcry against a Manhattan trial .
When the Justice Department announced in November its plans to try Mr. Mohammed and four alleged accomplices blocks from where the World Trade Center stood , Mr. Bloomberg hailed the location as not only workable but as a powerful symbol .
“ It is fitting that 9/11 suspects face justice near the World Trade Center site where so many New Yorkers were murdered , ” the mayor said at the time .
The federal courthouse had hosted major terror trials previously , he noted , and the police were more than up to the security challenge .
And so it is possible that the reversal will call into question the calibrated effort of Mr. Obama and his attorney general , Eric H. Holder Jr. , to bring the handling of suspected terrorists out of the realm of military emergency and into the halls of civilian justice .
If the message to Al Qaeda and its supporters in November was that New York City was able , even eager , to bring justice to those who plotted mass murder , the message of January is far less confident .
President Barack Obama will deliver the spring 2010 commencement address at the University of Michigan , where he will receive an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree , U - M announced Thursday evening .
“ President Obama has captured the imagination and enthusiasm of many students with his inspiring words of hope and change .
We are honored to welcome a leader of his distinction and look forward to his message , ” U - M President Mary Sue Coleman said in a written statement .
“ We could not be happier for the graduates who will celebrate their academic achievements with the president of the United States . ”
President Barack Obama will deliver U - M's commencement address May 1 .
The Associated Press
The ceremony will be held at 11 a.m. May 1 in Michigan Stadium .
U - M officials said further details of his visit will be announced soon .
It 's unclear how long U - M has been working to bring Obama to Ann Arbor for commencement .
U -M spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said the university extended the invitation , and Obama accepted .
He said he had no additional details to share , and U - M would not discuss any planned security measures for his visit .
Reaction to the news was swift and overwhelmingly positive .
U -M Regent Julia Donovan Darlow said she 's overjoyed by the news .
" I think it will be wonderful for the students and the university , " Donovan Darlow said .
" I think it 's tremendous . "
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje , who teaches a government course at U - M , said he hopes to be in attendance for Obama 's speech .
" I think it 's spectacular .
It 'll be good for the city and I look forward to hearing his message , " Hieftje said .
Hieftje recalled the time he attended Vice President Al Gore 's speech at the Community Center in 2000 , while Gore was running for president and Hiefjte was running his first campaign for mayor of Ann Arbor .
Abhishek Mahanti , the Michigan Student Assembly president and a computer science engineering senior , said Obama 's visit will be great for the ailing state , not just U - M and Ann Arbor .
Mahanti said he'd heard rumors Obama 's name was on the short list for commencement speaker and was optimistic it could happen .
" Everyone 's excited to see Barack Obama come here , " said Mahanti , who was celebrating in the student government offices with his peers .
" It was surprising , but my optimism got the better of me . "
Samuel Marvin , chairman of College Democrats at U - M , said Obama 's announced visit has him thinking back to what he learned in class about Lyndon B. Johnson 's 1964 speech at U - M , in which Johnson presented his goals for the Great Society .
Marvin said he expects
Obama 's speech to be similar in message , looking toward the future .
" It would be cool to hear something similar , " he said , mentioning education and health care reform as preferred topics .
Marvin said his group set two national records this past year for phone calls made during phone banks for Organizing for America , the grassroots effort building on the call - for - change movement that helped elect Obama .
Marvin said his group made more than 8,000 calls toward that effort last semester alone .
" This is something we 've been hoping for , " Marvin said .
" It 's pretty much the culmination of four years at this university . "
In this May 17 , 2009 , file photo , President Barack Obama delivers his commencement address through a teleprompter during commencement ceremonies at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend , Ind .
Obama will be greeted by a Michigan economy suffering from an unemployment crisis .
“ I do n’t think he needs to hear this , but I think a lot us want to hear about jobs , and are we going to get them after we graduate ? ” said U - M graduate student Evangeline Harvey , who is graduating this spring with a master ’s in education .
“ I have a feeling that that ’s one of his reasons for doing this . ”
Anne Bishop , an evolutionary anthropology senior at U - M , is graduating this spring .
" I can't believe it , " said Bishop , an Obama fan whose family is from the Chicago area .
" I called all my friends already .
They 're so excited . "
Even members of the U - M College Republicans say they 're looking forward to welcoming the president to campus - though they may not agree with his message .
" I 'm not his biggest fan , but that 's pretty impressive , " said U - M sophomore Charles Bogren , the group 's co-chair .
" Whether I agree with his policies or not , it 's great that the university can get somebody as prestigious as the president to deliver the commencement speech .
It 's no JFK on the steps of the Student Union , but it 's still pretty cool . "
Brady Smith , former chairman of the College Republicans , said he could hardly believe the news .
" I saw it on Facebook and then I had to double check , but I figured NPR is pretty reliable , " he said .
Smith , who will be graduating this semester with a degree in history and political science , said he looks forward to hearing what Obama has to say .
He said Obama sent the message during the 2008 primary that " Michigan does n't matter " by staying off the ballot and not campaigning here .
" He has a lot of explaining to do , " he said .
" And I 'm not so sure that after over a year in office college graduates now are any more optimistic than they were a year ago .
He does have some explaining to do , certainly to the Midwest , on the economics . "
Ann Arbor 's business community welcomed news of Obama 's visit - and the opportunity it could bring to promote the region .
“ What a fantastic opportunity to showcase our region and to expose him to the innovations and the excitement ” in the business community , said Elizabeth Parkinson , vice president of marketing and public relations for economic development firm Ann Arbor SPARK .

Top 10 Ann Arbor companies Barack Obama should visit in May
Ann Arbor ’s business community invited Obama to tour local companies when he visited the region in early 2009 during the height of the global auto crisis .
He did n’t visit the region then , but Parkinson said she ’s hopeful he ’ll make time to visit promising local companies in May .
Obama ’s visit comes as U - M scientists and local companies have been actively seeking federal stimulus dollars to support their research and growth .
U - M said in September that it had received more than $ 100 million in grants from the $ 787 billion economic stimulus package .
About half of that was from the National Institutes of Health for life sciences work .
Another $ 19.5 million was devoted to establishing a solar energy research center .
Parkinson said Obama 's decision to visit Ann Arbor is particularly appropriate due to the administration 's financial commitment to the region .
“ They ’re backing us up with their policies and funding , and this is kind of the exclamation point that comes along with that , ” Parkinson said .
Obama 's visit also comes after his administration provided $ 65 billion in emergency loans to General Motors and Chrysler to keep the Michigan - based automakers from liquidating last year .
Obama spoke at three college commencements in spring 2009 : Arizona State University , the University of Notre Dame and the U.S. Naval Academy .
Obama ’s address comes 10 years and one day after former President Bill Clinton delivered the commencement address at Eastern Michigan University while in office in 2000 .
Clinton also delivered the U - M spring commencement speech in 2007 .
According to U-M , Obama will be the fourth sitting president to visit the Ann Arbor campus .
The most recent was George H.W. Bush in May 1991 .
U - M alumnus Gerald R. Ford launched his re-election campaign at the university in September 1976 .
Lyndon B. Johnson was the first sitting president to visit U - M when he addressed the graduating class of 1964 .

Yesterday , Roger Waters was interviewed by legendary British TV presenter David Frost , on his " Frost Over The World " programme aired by Al Jazeera English TV channel .
In the interview , Roger talks about the Wall in 1990 , the history of the band ( with a focus on meeting Syd Barrett , and the growth of that relationship ) , and the " inevitable " break - up of Pink Floyd .
The Live8 reunion is remembered fondly , and he mentions , particularly in light of Richard Wright 's very sad passing , how the concert had " the small window of opportunity to actually play together for one last time , and it was very important to me that we did that - it was a terrific experience ... "
Finally , he talks again about his hopes for the proposed Wall tour of 2010 / 2011 , noting that he was currently " crunching all the numbers at the moment " , and noted that the tour would " probably be later next year " .

Are the Chinese Google and YouTube clones any good ?
With Google threatening to pull out of China , immitation versions of the search engine and its video subsidiary YouTube have emerged to take their places on the Chinese internet :
YouTubecn.com offers videos from the real YouTube , which is blocked in China .
The Google imitation is called Goojje and includes a plea for the U.S. - based Web giant not to leave China , after it threatened this month to do so in a dispute over Web censorship and cyberattacks .
The search engine behind Goojje was likely designed before the Google - China kerfuffle began then renamed as a marketing gimmick , and indeed the results it returns are fairly different than Google ’s .
( Goojje vs. Google searching for " Foreign Policy " . ) .
The site apparently complies with Chinese censorship guidelines , like the old chinese google .
I tried searching for " Dalai Lama " and got his official website .
" Rebiya Kadeer " worked also .
When I typed in a Google - translated version of " Dalai Lama " in Chinese characters , the top result was an article titled , " The Road of Treason . "
When I typed in " Falun Gong , " in English , I got an error message .
The same thing happened on multiple computers .
YouTubeCn is more more freewheeling , with videos on the persecution of Falun Gong and Rebiya Kadeer available .
While the layout is an almost exact rip - off of YouTube , the videos are really buggy with many requiring new versions of flash player and others not working at all .
Neither site seems like much of a substitute for the one it ’s based on in terms of functionality .
I do n’t think Baidu should have much to worry about .

The dreams that bricks are made of
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Look at a Lego brick and what do you see ?
A studded , brightly coloured block .
Perhaps you remember them from your childhood .
Perhaps that brick was part of a fire engine , a race car or a bulldozer .
Some people look at Lego bricks and see great potential buried within them .
In their hands Lego rises above its childhood origins and gets a chance to aspire , to be part of something great .
In Warren Elsmore 's hands 11,000 Lego bricks have been fashioned into a scale model of the Forth Railway Bridge .
The real thing is a marvel in all its riveted splendour and its tiny cousin , which stretches 6.5 metres , is too .
Its spans have the same breath - taking arcs as the original and the similarities do not end with its looks .
Whatever you build in Lego , you need a lot of bricks .
" The parts they had problems building on the real bridge were a problem for me too , " said Mr Elsmore .
In particular , he said , the point where the pylons and bridge supports meet on the base were very tricky to render in Lego .
Just as in the real bridge , some parts of the Lego model are in compression and some in tension .
The structure even flexes when under load .
The bridge is regularly shown off at Lego shows and some bits of it have to be replaced when Lego trains have been running across it for a few days .
" They turned to dust , " said Mr Elsmore who is also chairman of the Brickish Association , the UK 's club for adult fans of Lego .
The model took 18 months to put together and , so far , is the biggest model Mr Elsmore has built .
Screen dreams
Unlike the designers of the original , Mr Elsmore could turn to computers to help him draw up his plans .
He used a program called LDraw which is effectively a computer - aided design package for Lego bricks .
Warren Elsmore 's model is more than just bricks .
LDraw is written and maintained by adult fans of Lego .
It is kept updated so the new pieces that Lego releases are turned into virtual versions so people can use them in their models .
" Lego is no longer about a 2x4 brick with studs on the top , " said Chris Dee , one of the many Lego fans who helps to maintain LDraw .
" There are a lot of specialised elements created for individual sets . "
" You need to understand what physical parts exist in order to use it , " he said .
" LDraw is a system of tools for virtual modelling , " he said .
" It includes a library of parts and a set of tools and utilities to make use of that library . "
" Lego has produced a CAD tool that 's freely available but the level of sophistication does not match LDraw and the parts library is smaller , " Mr Dee told BBC News .
" They have the advantage of having the design drawings for the bricks .
We are effectively reverse engineering the parts , sometimes that is easier than at others . "
Adult fans of Lego use LDraw in different ways , said Mr Dee .
Some use it as a design tool so they can work out how to build a particular model .
One utility divides a building task into a series of steps just like in Lego instruction books .
" Some prefer to doodle with the physical bricks then they will use LDraw to keep what they have done and then rip it apart and try to improve it , " he said .
" There are also people that use it as a documentation tool after they have created a model , " he said .
But , said Mr Dee , using LDraw does not remove all the skill involved in making a Lego model .
" LDraw can show you how to represent a physical entity in the parts but it cannot tell you whether it will hold together , " he said .
" Sometimes there is just not enough connectivity . "
Art from bricks Mr Elsmore is using LDraw to plan his next model or MOC ( My Own Creation ) .
This is far more ambitious than the Forth Bridge .
Justin Ramsden used Lego to create works of art He is taking on the task of rendering in Lego , London 's St Pancras station .
So far , he has built the hotel at the front .
Next comes the engine shed round the back .
The finished model will be made of more than 100,000 bricks .
Building that would be impossible without a tool such as LDraw .
There are some Lego fans that use the bricks in much more artistic ways .
Justin Ramsden , at 18 the youngest member of the UK's Brickish Association , is an art and design student who is using Lego as his medium .
" I 've been using Lego all my life , " he said .
Many older Lego fans talk , he said , of a " dark age " when they put the bricks aside before returning to them later on .
" I have never really had a dark age , " he said .
" From the start , I just got my older brother 's sets and broke them up , rebuilt them to my own design . "
So far , Mr Ramsden has not turned to tools such as LDraw .
" I tend to build from eye or draw a few sketches and if I run out of bricks then I buy some or find them , " he said .
He has built a model of himself , undertaken commissions from the local council and is working on a life size head of Amy Winehouse made from Lego .
The attraction for all the adult fans of Lego is its versatility .
Many might dismiss it as a toy , a child 's plaything .
When they are told about what some are planning to build they might dismiss it and declare it impossible .
The Lego fans know better , just like the men who built the Forth Bridge .

The clock is ticking for light bulbs
The organic light - emitting diode ( OLED ) emits a brilliant white light when attached to an electricity supply .
The material , described in the journal Nature , can be printed in wafer thin sheets that could transform walls , ceilings or even furniture into lights .
The OLEDs do not heat up like today 's light bulbs and so are far more energy efficient and should last longer .
They also produce a light that is more akin to natural daylight than traditional bulbs .
" We 're hoping that this will lead to significantly longer device lifetimes in addition to higher efficiency , " said Professor Mark Thompson of the University of Southern California , one of the authors of the paper .
Old fashioned
Traditional light bulbs were invented more than 130 years ago .
Since then the basic principle of creating light remains the same , although the design has been tweaked .
An electric current passing through a tungsten wire causes it to heat up and glow white hot .
Today , more than 20 % of electricity used in US buildings is eaten up by lights and nearly half that amount is used by traditional , incandescent light bulbs .
It has been a long - term goal of scientists to come up with something that would reduce this mammoth energy demand .
The new work exploits the properties of carbon - based polymers to produce the white light .
These are already found in some mobile phone displays and MP3 players .
To create the new material , the scientists build up ultra - thin layers of plastics coated with green , red and blue dyes .
When an electric current passes through them , they combine to produce white light .
Previous attempts to make OLEDs like this have largely failed to make an impact because traditional phosphorescent blue dyes are very short lived .
The new polymer uses a fluorescent blue material instead which lasts much longer and uses less energy .
The researchers believe that eventually this material could be 100 % efficient , meaning it could be capable of converting all of the electricity to light , without the heat loss associated with traditional bulbs .
The new material can also be printed onto glass or plastic and so in theory could create large areas of lighting , relatively cheaply .
Before this becomes a reality , the scientists need to work out a way to seal the OLEDs from moisture which can contaminate the sensitive material , causing it to no longer work .
If that barrier can be overcome , the new polymer could eventually become the material of choice for stylish , environmentally friendly lighting .
The research team incorporated members from Princeton University , the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan .
