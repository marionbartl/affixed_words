Marriage and the Market
Stephanie Coontz ’s careful and persuasive history of marriage adds some much needed factual background to an over - politicized debate .
And her scholarship yields an important insight : marriage has historically been the product of the economic environment of the time .
Moreover , family institutions are dynamic , and marriage has evolved as economic opportunities have changed .
Our aim in this essay is to re-frame Coontz ’s careful history of the family in the language of economics , in the hope that this will yield useful insights about the future of marriage .
While Coontz describes the variety of forms of family life through history , the commonality uniting them is particularly significant : families have always played a role in “ filling in ” where incomplete market institutions would otherwise have hindered economic development .
For example , even in the absence of well - functioning contract law , families found ways to enforce agreements among kin .
This naturally gave the family a role as an organizing device for economic activity , and the limits of the firm often coincided with the limits of the family .
Thus marriage also provided the key means to strategic “ mergers ” — a way to form alliances and boost the financial welfare of the household .
Similarly , prior to the expansion of the welfare state , the family had been a key provider of insurance , as spouses agreed not only to support each other “ through richer , through poorer , in sickness and in health , ” but also extended this guarantee to parents , children , and siblings .
Before modern credit markets arrived , access to capital was often facilitated through family ties .
A number of goods and services , such as freshly cooked meals , or childcare , were historically not sold in the market sector .
Thus , the family became the firm producing these household services .
Just as Adam Smith observed that specialization by workers in the pin factory yielded more efficient production , so too families were organized so as to reap the benefits of specialization .
Thus households came to involve the specialization of one spouse , typically the husband , in the market , and the other in the domestic sphere .
The forces shaping family life have changed with the development of the market economy .
An increasingly sophisticated system of contract law has made possible enormous economic benefits , but in the process the modern corporation has come to supplant the family firm as the key unit of production .
The development of social insurance has spread greater security to many but has reduced the role of the family as a provider of insurance .
Most recently , technological , social , and legal changes have reduced the value of specialization within households .
While the political emancipation of women is surely a key factor in their movement from the home to the market , deeper economic forces are also at play .
Services previously produced in the home are now freely traded in the market .
Accordingly , there are fewer reasons for households to employ a domestic specialist .
With cheap clothes available at Wal - Mart , it makes more sense for women to earn money to buy clothes than to make them at home .
Other innovations have allowed technology to substitute for specialized domestic labor , as dishwashers , washing machines , and the more recent invention of the Roomba have made housework so easy that even a ( non-specialist ) husband can do it .
While the benefits of one member of a family specializing in the home have fallen , the costs of being such a specialist have risen .
Improvements in the technology of birth control have made investing in a wife ’s human capital a better bet , and this has been abetted by a decline in discrimination and improved wages .
These greater opportunities also connote a greater opportunity cost for a couple contemplating a stay - at - home spouse .
Advances in medicine have yielded rising life expectancy , and the average woman will now spend less than a quarter of her adult life with young children in the household .
By increasing the number of potential years in the labor force , the opportunity cost of women staying out of the labor market to be home with children is higher .
Rising life expectancy also reduces the centrality of children to married life , as couples now expect to live together for decades after children have left the nest .
Other marriages are occurring when women are in the post - fertility part of their lives .
Only 41 % of married couples currently have their own children present in their household ( down from 75 % in 1880 ) .
Not surprisingly then , modern marriage is somewhat less child - centric than it once was .
So what drives modern marriage ?
We believe that the answer lies in a shift from the family as a forum for shared production , to shared consumption .
In case the language of economic lacks romance , let ’s be clearer : modern marriage is about love and companionship .
Most things in life are simply better shared with another person : this ranges from the simple pleasures such as enjoying a movie or a hobby together , to shared social ties such as attending the same church , and finally , to the joint project of bringing up children .
Returning to the language of economics , the key today is consumption complementarities — activities that are not only enjoyable , but are more enjoyable when shared with a spouse .
We call this new model of sharing our lives “ hedonic marriage ” .
So is marriage doomed ?
Marriage in which one person specializes in the home while the other person specializes in the market is indeed doomed .
The opportunity cost of having women stay out of the labor force is likely to continue to rise — particularly as young women are surpassing men in educational attainment and higher education is becoming more important for market success .
The reach of markets will continue to expand , allowing individuals and families to reap the returns to specialization through market - mediated trade with other specialists , rather than requiring a domestic specialist in each home .
Yet while the changing marketplace may have made marriage a bit more fragile , it is also key to its survival .
Rising productivity has given all Americans more leisure time while simultaneously raising standards of living .
As consumption increases , so too will the demand to have someone with whom to share these pleasures .
Thus marriage is n’t dead , it is , again , transforming .
Hedonic marriage is different from productive marriage .
In a world of specialization , the old adage was that “ opposites attract , ” and it made sense for husband and wife to have different interests in different spheres of life .
Today , it is more important that we share similar values , enjoy similar activities , and find each other intellectually stimulating .
Hedonic marriage leads people to be more likely to marry someone of their similar age , educational background , and even occupation .
As likes are increasingly marrying likes , it is n’t surprising that we see increasing political pressure to expand marriage to same - sex couples .
At this juncture it should be clear that any sensible theory of marriage has to acknowledge that it is a responsive and adaptive institution , changing as circumstances change .
Why then is the debate about family policy so polarizing ?
We suspect that much of the disagreement is driven by a failure of political advocates to adapt their understanding of marriage even as circumstances have changed .
Many have cited high and rising divorce rates as pointing to the collapse of the family , and Kay Hymowitz ’s essay reprises these themes .
Yet the high divorce rates among those marrying in the 1970s reflected a transition , as many married the right partner for the old specialization model of marriage , only to find that pairing hopelessly inadequate in the modern hedonic marriage .
Divorce rates have actually been falling since reaching a peak thirty years ago .
And those who have married in recent years have been more likely to stay together than their parents ’ generation .
These facts should be emphasized and bear repeating — divorce has been falling for three decades — since this important fact is often ignored in the discussion of the current state of the family .
Hymowitz also bemoans the fact that the demographics of marriage are changing .
Again , the facts warrant closer scrutiny : College - educated women used to be the least likely to marry , and today they are about as likely as those without a college degree to marry .
Several decades ago , a woman earning a graduate degree was unlikely to find the old specialization model of marriage to be useful , and many therefore chose to remain single .
But today ’s hedonic marriage is likely more enticing for educated women .
On the flipside , the decline in marriage among less - educated women would be an important concern if we were still in the world where women needed a husband for financial security .
Less educated women have their own market opportunities available to them and have less to gain from marrying today than in the past .
The new hedonic model of marriage thrives when households have the time and resources to enjoy their lives .
This suggests that increasing the financial stability of these households will lead to marriage rather than marriage leading to financial stability .
Trends in marital behavior reflect a common - sense response to the economic and social circumstances surrounding us .
Just as we have deregulated the economy so that firms and businesses can deal with changing conditions , the long - run trend in U.S. family policy has been to deregulate the marriage market , and the book of rules governing who can get married or divorced where and when has become much thinner .
Yet much of the current political debate is precisely about re-regulating marriage .
Our concern is that this re-regulation may actually be a force undermining the dynamic institution that is the modern U.S. family .
In an investigation carried out by Guardian Films for Channel 4 , we uncover how thousands of Iraqis employed at $ 10 a day by the US to take on al - Qaida are threatening to go on strike because they say they have been used by the ' Americans to do their dirty work ' and have n't been paid

Email this Page U.S. Middle East Policy U.S. Vetoes of U.N. Resolutions on Behalf of Israel By Donald Neff
Former Time Magazine Bureau Chief , Israel
This updated version was published in Fifty Years of Israel
Originally printed in Washington Report , September ⁄ October 1993 Donald Neff has been a journalist for forty years .
He spent 16 years in service for Time Magazine and is a regular contributor to Middle East International and the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs .
He has written five excellent books on the Middle East .
On March 17 , 1970 , the United States cast its first veto in the United Nations Security Council during the presidency of Richard Nixon , when Henry Kissinger was the national security adviser .
It was a historic moment , since up to that time Washington had been able to score heavy propaganda points because of the Soviet Union ’s profligate use of its veto .
The first U.S. veto in history was a gesture of support for Britain , which was under Security Council pressure to end the white minority government in southern Rhodesia .
Two years later , however , on Sept. 10 , 1972 , the United States employed its veto for the second time — to shield Israel .
1
That veto , as it turned out , signalled the start of a cynical policy to use the U.S. veto repeatedly to shield Israel from international criticism , censure and sanctions .
Washington used its veto 32 times to shield Israel from critical draft resolutions between 1972 and 1997 .
This constituted nearly half of the total of 69 U.S. vetoes cast since the founding of the U.N.
The Soviet Union cast 115 vetoes during the same period .
2
The initial 1972 veto to protect Israel was cast by George Bush [ Sr. ] in his capacity as U.S. ambassador to the world body .
Ironically , it was Bush as president who temporarily stopped the use of the veto to shield Israel 18 years later .
The last such veto was cast on May 31 , 1990 , it was thought , killing a resolution approved by all 14 other council members to send a U.N. mission to study Israeli abuses of Palestinians in the occupied territories .
Then President Bill Clinton came along and cast three more .
The rationale for casting the first veto to protect Israel was explained by Bush at the time as a new policy to combat terrorists .
The draft resolution had condemned Israel ’s heavy air attacks against Lebanon and Syria , starting Sept. 6 , the day after 11 Israeli athletes were killed at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games in an abortive Palestinian attempt to seize them as hostages to trade for Palestinians in Israeli prisons .
3
Between 200 and 500 Lebanese , Syrians and Palestinians , mostly civilians , were killed in the Israeli raids .
4
Nonetheless , Bush complained that the resolution had failed to condemn terrorist attacks against Israel , adding : “ We are implementing a new policy that is much broader than that of the question of Israel and the Jews .
What is involved is the problem of terrorism , a matter that goes right to the heart of our civilized life . ” 5
Unfortunately , this “ policy ” proved to be only a rationale for protecting Israel from censure for violating a broad range of international laws .
This became very clear when the next U.S. veto was cast a year later , on July 26 , 1973 .
It had nothing to do with terrorism .
The draft resolution affirmed the rights of the Palestinians and established provisions for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories as embodied in previous General Assembly resolutions .
6
Nonetheless , Washington killed this international effort to end Israel ’s occupation of Palestinian lands .
Washington used the veto four more times in 1975 - 76 while Henry Kissinger was secretary of state .
One of these vetoes arguably may have involved terrorism , since the draft condemned Israeli attacks on Lebanese civilians in response to attacks on Israel .
But the three other vetoes had nothing at all to do with terrorism .
One , in fact , struck down a draft resolution that reflected U.S. policy against Israel ’s alteration of the status of Jerusalem and establishment of Jewish settlements in occupied territory .
Only two days earlier , U.S. Ambassador William W. Scranton had given a speech in the United Nations calling Israeli settlements illegal and rejecting Israel ’s claim to all of Jerusalem .
7
Yet on March 25 , 1976 , the U.S. vetoed a resolution reflecting Scranton ’s positions which had been passed unanimously by the other 14 members of the council .
8
The two other vetoes during Kissinger ’s reign also were cast in 1976 .
One , on Jan. 26 , killed a draft resolution calling for recognition of the right of self - determination for Palestinians .
The other , on June 29 , called for affirmation of the “ inalienable rights ” of the Palestinians .9
The Carter administration cast only one veto .
But it had nothing to do with terrorism .
It came on April 30 , 1980 , killing a draft that endorsed self - determination for the Palestinian people .
10
The all - time abuser of the veto was the administration of Ronald Reagan , the most pro-Israel presidency in U.S. history , with the most pro-Israel secretary of state , George Shultz , since Kissinger .
The Reagan team cynically invoked the veto 18 times to protect Israel .
A record six of these vetoes were cast in 1982 alone .
Nine of the Reagan vetoes resulted directly from Security Council attempts to condemn Israel ’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon , and Israel ’s refusal to surrender the territory in southern Lebanon which it still occupies today .
The other nine vetoes shielded Israel from council criticism for such illicit acts as the Feb.
4 , 1986 , skyjacking of a Libyan plane .11 Israeli warplanes forced the executive jet to land in Israel , allegedly in an effort to capture Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal .
He was not aboard and , after interrogation , the passengers were allowed to leave .
12 The U.S. delegate explained that this act of piracy was excusable “ because we believe that the ability to take such action in carefully defined and limited circumstances is an aspect of the inherent right of self - defense recognized in the U.N. Charter .
” 13 Other vetoes employed on Israel ’s exclusive behalf included the Jan. 20 , 1982 killing of a demand that Israel withdraw from the Golan Heights it had occupied in 196714 ; the April 20 , 1982 condemnation of an Israeli soldier who shot 11 Muslim worshippers at the Haram Al - Sharif in the Old City of Jerusalem 15 ; the Feb.
1 , 1988 call for Israel to stop violating Palestinian human rights in the occupied territories , abide by the Fourth Geneva Convention and formalize a leading role for the United Nations in future peace negotiations16 ; the April 15 , 1988 resolution requesting that Israel permit the return of expelled Palestinians , condemning Israel ’s shooting of civilians , calling on Israel to uphold the Fourth Geneva Convention and calling for a peace settlement under U.N. auspices .
17 The Bush [ Sr. ] administration used the veto four times to protect Israel : on Feb. 17 , 1989 , to kill a draft strongly deploring Israel ’s repression of the Palestinian uprising and calling on Israel to respect the human rights of the Palestinians18 ; on June 9 , 1989 , deploring Israel ’s violation of the human rights of the Palestinians19 ; on Nov. 7 , 1989 , demanding Israel return property confiscated from Palestinians during a tax protest and calling on Israel to allow a fact - finding mission to observe Israel ’s suppression tactics against the Palestinian uprising20 ; and , finally , on May 31 , 1990 , calling for a fact - finding mission on abuses against Palestinians in Israeli - occupied lands .
21
The May 31 , 1990 veto was the last , presumably , as the result of a secret understanding , if not an official agreement , with Russia and the three other Security Council members with veto power .
By then it had become obvious that the council could not be effective in a post - Cold War world if Britain , China , France , Russia and the United States recklessly invoked their vetoes .
Moreover , the international alliances sought by Washington to repel Iraq ’s invasion of Kuwait in August , 1990 made it necessary for the Bush administration to retain unity in the Security Council .
As a result , instead of abstaining on or vetoing resolutions critical of Israel , as it did in 1989 and the first half of 1990 , the Bush administration abruptly joined other members in late 1990 , 1991 and 1992 in passing six resolutions deploring or strongly condemning Israel ’s conduct against the Palestinians .
22
These resolutions brought the total passed by the council against Israel since its birth to 68 .
If the United States had not invoked its veto , the record against Israel would total 100 resolutions condemning or otherwise criticizing its behavior or supporting the rights of Palestinians .
The agreement on vetoes held until March , 1995 , when President Clinton invoked the veto after all 14 other members approved a U.N. Security Council resolution calling on Israel to rescind a decision to expropriate 130 acres of land in Arab East Jerusalem .
23
The Clinton administration exercised two more vetoes in 1997 , both of them on resolutions otherwise unanimously supported by the 14 other Security Council members .
The draft resolution was critical of Israel ’s plans to establish a new settlement at Har Homa ⁄ Jabal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem in the midst of Palestinian housing .
24 The three Clinton vetoes brought to 32 the number Washington has cast to protect Israel .

Mathare is one of countless slums in Kenya that the government does not quite reach .
There are no police stations here , or fire hydrants or roads .
There are few toilets and the hillsides reek of fresh waste .
Many of the dented metal kiosks advertise — in dripping hand - painted scrawl — paraffin for oil lamps , because despite the palatial homes in the neighborhood next door that light up like soccer stadiums at night , most Mathare dwellers have no electricity .
“ These people live like beasts , ” said Ms. Bokindo , one of the government officials in charge of Mathare .
The Mungiki did not start here .
They came from the Kikuyu highlands north of Nairobi , that carpeted green , straight - off - a- postcard “ Out of Africa ” side of Kenya .
According to Hezekiah Ndura Waruinge , one of the Mungiki ’s founders , the group began as a local defense squad during land clashes in the late 1980s between forces loyal to the government , which was dominated by the Kalenjin tribe , and farmers who were Kikuyu , a rival tribe .
The Mungiki , whose name means multitude in the Kikuyu language , modeled themselves after the Mau Mau , Kenya ’s independence fighters who sprouted dreadlocks , took secret oaths and waged a hit - and - run guerrilla war against British colonizers .
By the late 1990s , the Mungiki went urban , Mr. Waruinge explained , taking over the city ’s minibus trade .
Then they diversified into garbage collection , building materials and eventually the protection racket .
“ It was beautiful , ” Mr. Waruinge said .
“ We had 500,000 members and millions of shillings coming in every day . ”
Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy ( MPIfR ) in Bonn have detected for the first time a molecule closely related to an amino acid : amino acetonitrile .
The organic molecule was found with a 30 metre radio telescope in Spain and two radio interferometers in France and Australia in the " Large Molecule Heimat " , a giant gas cloud near the galactic centre in the constellation Sagittarius ( Astronomy & Astrophysics , in press ) .
The " Large Molecule Heimat " is a very dense , hot gas clump within the star forming region Sagittarius B2 .
In this source of only 0,3 light - year diameter , which is heated by a deeply embedded newly formed star , most of the interstellar molecules known to date have been found , including the most complex ones such as ethyl alcohol , formaldehyde , formic acid , acetic acid , glycol aldehyde ( a basic sugar ) , and ethylene glycol .
Starting from 1965 , more than 140 molecular species have been detected in space , in interstellar clouds as well as in circumstellar envelopes .
A large fraction of these molecules is organic or carbon - based .
A lot of attention is given to the quest for so - called " bio " - molecules , especially interstellar amino acids .
Amino acids , the building blocks of proteins and therefore key ingredients for the origin of life , have been found in meteorites on Earth , but not yet in interstellar space .
The simplest amino acid , glycine ( NH 2 CH 2 COOH ) , has long been searched for in the interstellar medium but has so far not been unambiguously detected .
Since the search for glycine has turned out to be extremely difficult , a chemically related molecule was searched for , amino acetonitrile ( NH 2 CH 2 CN ) , probably a direct precursor of glycine .
The scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy in Bonn selected the " Large Molecule Heimat " , as the source has been named by experts , and investigated a dense forest of 3700 spectral lines from complex molecules with the IRAM 30 - metre telescope in Spain .
Atoms and molecules emit light at very specific frequencies , which appear as characteristic lines in the radiation spectrum .
By analyzing these spectral lines , astronomers can determine the chemical composition of cosmic clouds .
The more complex a molecule is , the more possibilities it has to radiate its internal energy .
This is the reason why complex molecules emit many spectral lines , which are very weak and therefore difficult to identify in the " line jungle . "
" Still , we were finally able to assign 51 very weak lines to the molecule amino acetonitrile " says Arnaud Belloche , scientist at the Max Planck institute and first author of the research paper .
This result was confirmed at 10 times higher spatial resolution with two radio telescope arrays , the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer in France and the Australia Telescope Compact Array .
These observations showed that all the candidate lines were emitted from the same position in the " Large Molecule Heimat " , " a strong proof of the reliability of our identification . "
" Finding amino acetonitrile has greatly extended our insight into the chemistry of dense , hot star - forming regions .
I am sure we will be able to identify in the future many new , even more complex organic molecules in the interstellar gas .
We already have several candidates ! " says Karl Menten , director at the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy and head of the " Millimeter and Submillimeter Astronomy " research group .

When I walked into Charles Dunstone 's office at Carphone Warehouse 's giant blue shed on a West London trading estate , he was in fighting mood .
Brandishing a document , he told me : " They 've sent us the most unbelievably rude letter . "
They were the BPI - the music industry 's trade body - and Mr Dunstone , whose TalkTalk business is Britain 's third biggest internet service provider , saw that letter as a declaration of war .
The BPI has been writing to all the big ISPs with a proposal .
It wants them to warn their users that file - sharing is not an acceptable activity - and then disconnect those who ignore repeated warnings to desist .
The ISPs do n't like the idea of chucking out customers - but they and their trade association have been keeping a low profile on this issue .
Not so Carphone Warehouse .
Charles Dunstone was so angry about that letter , which he says threatened legal action if he did n't comply with the BPI 's demands within 14 days , that he issued a call to arms .
" TalkTalk rejects music industry threats and refuses to become internet police " said the press release that came hurtling out of that shed in Acton .
Mr Dunstone is angry for two reasons - he does n't want to start telling his customers how to behave , and he thinks the music industry is trying to make him pay the price for its failure to adapt to the digital age .
" They 're not just shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted - the horse has left town , got married , and started a family . "
So what 's the other side of this story ?
Well the music industry thinks Carphone Warehouse is being mischievous .
The BPI has issued an equally combative press release which says " TalkTalk either seek to misrepresent our position or just does n't get it . "
The trade body says it is not asking ISPs to police the internet , but simply to act on evidence that it will provide about users who are engaged in music piracy .
Lurking in the back of this very noisy battle is the government .
The BPI believes that it has convinced ministers that the ISPs need to play their part in the battle against file - sharing .
Jeff Taylor of the BPI told us : " The government says if ISPs do not start helping to deal with this problem in a helpful way then there will be legislation . "
Charles Dunstone says he will fight all the way against any move to make him cut off customers engaged in file - sharing - and he does n't believe there is any chance that the government will bring in laws to force him to do that .
Mr Dunstone is pretty well plugged in to the current government - so he 's probably right .
Ministers have been lobbied with some vigour on this issue by the music industry - but the BPI may find that supportive mood music from the government does n't translate into new laws .
Researchers have developed an energy - capturing knee brace can generate enough electricity from walking to operate a portable GPS locator , a cell phone , a motorized prosthetic joint or an implanted neurotransmitter .
The wearable mechanism works much like regenerative braking charges a battery in some hybrid vehicles where they collect the kinetic energy that would otherwise be dissipated as heat when a car slows down .
This knee brace harvests the energy lost when a human brakes the knee after swinging the leg forward to take a step , researchers at the University of Michigan said in a release .
The scientists tested the knee brace on six men walking on a treadmill at 2.2 miles per hour .
They measured the subjects ' respiration to determine how hard they were working .
A control group wore the brace with the generator disengaged to measure how the weight of the 3.5 - pound brace affected the wearer , researchers said .
Test subjects walking with one device on each leg produced an average of 5 watts of electricity , which is about 10 times that of shoe - mounted devices .
In the mode in which the brace is only activated while the knee is braking , the subjects required less than one watt of extra metabolic power for each watt of electricity they generated .
A typical hand - crank generator , for comparison , takes an average of 6.4 watts of metabolic power to generate one watt of electricity because of inefficiencies of muscles and generators , researchers said .
" The body is clever .
In a lot of places where it could be dissipating energy , it may actually be storing it and getting it back elastically .
Your tendons act like springs .
In many places , we 're not sure whether the energy is really being dissipated or you 're just storing it temporarily .
We believe that when you 're slowing down the knee at the end of swinging the leg , most of that energy normally is just wasted , ” said Arthur Kuo , an associate professor of mechanical engineering at Michigan and an author of a paper on the device that appears in the Feb. 8 issue of the journal Science .
Researchers said the prototype device is bulky and heavy and that they want to develop a lighter version that would be helpful to hikers or soldiers who do n't have easy access to electricity .
And the scientists say similar mechanisms could be built into prosthetic knees other implantable devices such as pacemakers or neurotransmitters that today require a battery , and periodic surgery to replace that battery .
I spent the weekend in Amsterdam , doing ordinary touristy things on the days when I was n't attending the 2008 edition of the European Common Lisp Meeting .
I suspect that most readers of this diary are likely to prefer a summary of the ECLM to the details of my wanderings on the ( rather cold ) Saturday , so that is what I shall provide .
Walking through the streets of continental cities early ( around 08:00 ) on a Sunday Morning is usually a pleasant experience – everything is closed , most people are n't even yet going to appropriate religious observances , and so you get an unimpeded view of the town , devoid of the hordes that can cause obstruction or aggravation .
Unfortunately , Amsterdam is a somewhat popular destination for British ‘ stag ’ parties ; and , indeed , as I was walking down Leidsestraat , two such parties , who did not seem to be the sort to be going either to an appropriate religious observance or to the ECLM , passed each other .
Noise ensued .
On arriving at the Felix Meritis , at 08:30 on the dot , I saw a crowd of people , all seemingly with the same idea : to have the first coffee of the day .
Fortunately , the doors opened shortly afterwards , and caffeination was allowed to take place .
Conversation happened as well , though I can't remember very much of it , not yet having been fully invigorated by the coffee .
Mostly I think I explained why I was n't on the previous night 's boat trip : a combination of somewhat tardy registration and a second mouth to feed ...
And then the real action , the talks , got under way .
Unlike many an academic conference , of of the ECLM 's distinguishing features is that the talks are attended by the vast majority of the participants ; there 's much less of a feeling that people simply attend to chat to colleagues : probably partly because the talks are very much the ‘ deliverable ’ of the meeting ( there are no proceedings or anything like that ) but also , I think , because the talks cover interesting ground , and offer perspectives based on a solid amount of experience .
Jeremy Jones ( from Clozure Associates ) started the ball rolling , with a talk on the production of InspireData : an application built for data visualization in an ( American , pre-University ) educational context .
Jeremy wisely started off with a demonstration of InspireData 's features ; it contains some very impressive - looking tools , and seems to present them to the user in a sensible way .
I have n't tried it or gone beyond the demo , but it looks like a huge advance on , say , using an off - the - shelf spreadsheet program to do data analysis , even ( dare I say it ) for professionals – though whether it scales up to professional - sized data sets is another question .
Some other take - home messages from Jeremy 's talk : it is possible to sell shrink - wrapped software , even today , even written in Lisp ; having a proper designer on the team ( or as your client ) can help enormously in producing a usable interface ; and having a programmer as your client can be both a help and a hindrance – specify the acceptance process carefully .
Nicholas Neuss followed Jeremy , with a discussion of the FEMLISP framework for solving partial differential equations .
Being in a somewhat darkened room , early in the morning at a weekend reminded me a little of my undergraduate days , where discussion of differential equations , fields and the like was par for the course – and the talk took me right back ( in a good way ) .
In particular , watching FEMLISP compute the eigenmodes of Lake Constance ( surface waves , I think ) was entertaining .
One difference in kind between this talk and the previous is , I think , a function of the possible ‘ market ’ for the two tools ; InspireData is sold in quantities of the order of tens of thousands at present , while , let 's face it , FEMLISP is never going to have that kind of exposure : and so the resources are n't really available to make FEMLISP into a product usable by even other domain experts .
Of course , the fact that Nicholas ' boss makes a competing product might also have something to do with that ...
There followed a talk about large Internet systems , from Stefan Richter .
There was an interesting survey during the talk , asking people about the size of their userbase ( assuming that they worked on web applications at all ) .
An interesting distribution ; certainly applications with millions of users are no longer rare – and Juho showed commendable restraint in not snorting something along the lines of “ millions of users ? ”
One other interesting moment was when Nick Levine stopped Stefan , to give him time to write down the long list of libraries that is already available to help build Lisp web applications , from the database to the front - end .
Kilian Sprotte gave the last presentation before lunch , talking about the GL - enabled Patchwork music visual programming system .
The presentation unfortunately appeared to be a little bit unrehearsed , and so I 'm not sure that Kilian got everything that he wanted to across to the general audience .
From my perspective , though , it was sufficiently close to the day job that I could see the point ( and catch some of the references ; B - A - C - H and so on ) – I 'll be able to report back to people in the lab , who were asking about it , and maybe we can find some useful musical analysis algorithms in there .
Also , it occurred to me that GSharp could usefully provide some import or export functionality for the chord and score editors , maybe through MusicXML , or maybe writing directly into the PWGL notations for notes ( tighter couplings are likely to be hard , given PWGL 's current non-Open- Source nature . )
Then we broke for lunch ; Juho , Nikodemus and I ended up sitting on a table with Hannes Mehnert and Luke Gorrie ; among other conversations , we had The Great SBCL Maintenance Debate , and we now have a proposed Plan .
( I do n't know if any other plans have been proposed , but hopefully soon there will be less uncertainty . )
The rest of the lunch break was spent grilling Luke about OLPC and Kathmandu , and eating interesting interpretations of café food .
( Pasta arrabiata with beans and squash ?
I do n't think so . )
After lunch , a talk about cheap apartment design architect assistance software : Knowledge - Based Engineering , where in this case the knowledge base is about Norwegian building regulations .
The idea of the House Designer product developed at Selvaag is to allow architects to experiment with designs , while tracking that building rules ( both governmentally - imposed and the house style ) can be accommodated , along with all the necessary pipes and electrics and so on .
It was good to see a variety of techniques on display , and I liked the flashes of humour : for instance , that the user - interface group asking for XML descriptions was OK by the Lisp group , but that then the user - interface group wanted to send XML back , and that was not OK .
It 's good to know that Frode Fjeld has a Lisp job , too ; he was solidly namechecked in the presentation .
Then Juan José García - Ripoll came to the stage to talk about ECL design and implementation .
There were some wry moments for me there ; starting with the observation that he was n't really a computer scientist at all , but rather a physicist .
Also , many of the motivations for the ECL design appear to be direct analogues of some of SBCL's PRINCIPLES : completeness , clean bootstrappability , and preferring maintainability over whizzy features , for instance ( I hope I 'm not mischaracterizing here ; it 's possible I 'm just evaluating what he said through an SBCL - tinted lens ) .
Given that , I think it 's interesting how different the two systems look , maybe just from having different starting points ?
After the final coffee break , yet more talks .
Marc Battyani , of FractalConcept HPC
Platform , talked about using Lisp to program FPGAs for custom high - performance solutions ; in particular , applications in the financial world , such as derivative valuations and automatic share trading platforms .
( A word of advice to Marc : it 's not often that you get to say that you 're 1000 times as fast as your nearest competitor , nor that you can process packets faster than the test network can send them to you – so do n't let that message get hidden by the constant fumbling for a particular Microsoft Image and Fax viewer window ! )
The products he has look interesting ; best of luck to him for finding a buyer in these more financially - challenged times ...
And finally , the pièce de résistance : Kenny Tilton took the stage , to give “ a rant on the state of Lisp and Lispniks touching on Algebra software , Lisp libraries , Open Source , Cello , Cells , and somewhere along the way introducing Triple - Cells , animated data modelling with persistence for free ” .
Unfortunately , it seemed that we were n't going to get this rant ; instead , we got a small demo of the Algebra tutoring software , along with some discussion of the dataflow paradigm that Kenny believes is central to all simple applications , and a fair number of sound effects .
Nice anecdote about Lisp and speeding tickets , though .
Then it was all over bar the dinner ; I chatted to Pascal Costanza and Charlotte Herzeel about the busy workshop season , to Jeremy Jones and Marco Baringer about the ( lack of ) checkin policy to SBCL's CVS , to Edi about how much Heathrow Airport sucks , among many conversations .
As we were about to call it a night , Nick mentioned that the Lambda Express had some spare tickets , and that we could probably hitch a lift back to London by train ( rather than by plane to Terminal 5 ... ) , so we arranged to meet Dave Fox and his crew the following morning .
While on the train , in a spirit of cross-implementation co-operation , we essentially finished the Araucaria from the Saturday Guardian – documentary evidence will be forthcoming .
And then it really was all over .
Conformity gets a bad rap .
From NYT Mag :
The psychologists Bert Hodges and Anne Geyer recently took a new look at a well - known experiment devised by Asch in the 1950s .
Asch ’s subjects were asked to look at a line printed on a white card and then tell which of three similar lines was the same length .
The answer was obvious , but the catch was that each volunteer was sitting in a small group whose other members were actually in on the experiment .
Asch found that when those other people all agreed on the wrong answer , many of the subjects went along with the group , against the evidence of their own senses .
But the question ( Which of these lines matches the one on the card ? ) was not posed just once .
Each subject saw 18 sets of lines , and the group answer was wrong for 12 of them .
Examining all the data , Hodges and Geyer found that many people were varying their answers , sometimes agreeing with the group , more often sticking up for their own view .
( The average participant gave in to the group three times out of 12 . )
This means that the subjects in the most famous " people are sheep " experiment were not sheep at all – they were human beings who largely stuck to their guns , but now and then went along with the group .
The number of US military deaths in Iraq since the invasion began in 2003 has reached 4,000 , the military said , after a roadside bomb killed four US soldiers in Baghdad yesterday .
The statement by US - led coalition forces said one US soldier was wounded in the attack .
The US soldiers were killed around 10:00 pm local time while on patrol in vehicles in southern Baghdad .
The deaths came on a day when Baghdad 's fortified " Green Zone " was assaulted repeatedly by rocket or mortar attack , and police said up to 17 people had been killed by rockets falling short outside the government and diplomatic compound .
The attacks were part of a wider increase in violence in the capital and in the northern city of Mosul , underlining warnings by US military commanders that recent security gains in Iraq are both fragile and reversible .
In the past , the US military has blamed such attacks on the Green Zone on rogue elements of Shiite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr 's Mehdi Army militia .
Cleric
Sadr has imposed a cease - fire on the militia , but there have been signs that it is fraying .
In Mosul , a suicide truck bomber killed 15 Iraqi soldiers and wounded 45 people , including civilians , in an attack on an Iraqi army base , the Interior Ministry said .
US commanders describe Mosul as Al Qaeda 's last urban stronghold in Iraq .

Just two days after WND published an exclusive guest column criticizing noted matchmaking service eHarmony.com for advising about one - night stands , the company has apologized and pulled the advice from its website .
" eHarmony is committed to helping its members find highly compatible , long - term relationships , and I regret that the inappropriate content and tone of the column could lead our members to believe that we were not interested in their long - term relationship success , " said the posting from Stan Holt , vice president for publishing .
" For nearly a decade , eHarmony has served its members very effectively by delivering matches that have resulted in tens of thousands of marriages .
We apologize to anyone who read the column and found it inappropriate , " he said .
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
The commentary from J.P. and Amanda Duffy noted how the couple , celebrating their two - year anniversary of being matched on eHarmony , had " praised the matching service for promoting healthy , life - long marriage relationships . "
Amanda is a high school art teacher and J.P. is media director for the Family Research Council , a Washington , D.C. - based public policy organization .
" To the skeptics of online dating , we explained that eHarmony is unique in that the matching service does n't promote the ' hook - up ' culture .
According to the company 's mission statement , their goal is to ' help couples achieve stronger , healthier and happier marriages , ' " the couple wrote .
But then a friend told them of eHarmony 's e-newsletter : " Navigating the one - night stand . "
" Our friend read the first few lines : ' So you 're a swinging single , and you 've had a one - night stand .
What 's the etiquette for establishing boundaries , calling the day after and getting out without hurting feelings ? ' " the couple wrote .
" Promoting such high - risk , promiscuous behavior is outrageous and irresponsible , " they wrote .
" The advice column glosses over the risks of sexually transmitted diseases ... , " they wrote .
" Also glossed over is the increased risk for violence among those who ' navigate ' multiple sexual partners . "
" Several years ago , Dr. Neil Clark Warren , founder of eHarmony , was closely associated with Focus on the Family .
He separated from the organization after deciding to expand his services to the wider market .
However , ' Navigating the One Night Stand ' takes this a step further by completely breaking eHarmony away from its Christian , pro-marriage beginnings , " the couple wrote .
But the apology from Holt said " the advice contained in this column was completely inconsistent with our editorial guidelines and the relationship service that we offer to our members .
The day after sending the e-mail newsletter , I was made aware of the column , and it was immediately removed from our site . "
" You deserve and expect the best from eHarmony and we are dedicated to providing information that resonates with our diverse , vibrant , and thriving community , " he continued .
" Please be assured that we are immediately upgrading our editorial review process and are also reviewing our existing content to make sure that it is consistent with the interests of our members . "

" I wanted to thank you for publishing our op - ed on the eHarmony ' One Night Stand ' article , " J.P. Duffy wrote to WND .
" My wife and I have received many supportive e-mails from your readers .
eHarmony sent me an apology and posted it on their website . "
" We fully accept the apology and are greatly encouraged that the statement calls the article ' completely inconsistent ' with the relationship service that they offer to their members , " he wrote .
" I thank eHarmony for recognizing its mistake and making it clear that they wish to remain in the values - matching service business . "
The company boasts it is " America 's No. 1 trusted relationship service . "
" Recent research presented at the American Psychological Society found that eHarmony married couples are significantly happier than couples married for a similar length of time who met by other means , " the website says .

Build a Pocket Theremin on the Cheap
Throw together this pint - sized light - sensitive Theremin for spooky sci- fi sound effects on the cheap
The pages of this newspaper hold two sharply divergent visions of how to eat in a world heading toward 9 billion people seeking a decent life .
Video
There is news from animal - rights campaigners of a big prize for cheap in - vitro meat ( I still crave a different name ) .
And there is Michael Pollan ’s magazine essay on the virtues of attacking the climate problem , in part , by growing at least one item on your menu yourself , whether in a plot hacked out of a lawn or a pot on a rooftop .
His essay is in The Times Magazine ’s “ green issue , ” published to coincide with Earth Day .
( Personally , I am looking forward to the day we — in the media and society at large — have moved “ beyond green , ” to where the environmental facets of a choice are simply part of the natural calculation we make in considering options , not a separate added value imposed on the choice . )
I do love local food , and do n’t get into a knot over whether it ’s more carbon - intensive than something shipped from a factory - style farm , mainly because I value the broader set of environmental qualities that are sustained when a landscape , whether my yard or my valley , is productive and interactive .
For more on this , see my video interview ( and cooking lesson ) with Peter Hoffman , a Manhattan chef with a passion for regional and seasonal produce .
As he explains , there are many benefits — far beyond food miles — that come with reconnecting at least a little with seasons , soil , and the harvest .
As Mr. Pollan makes clear in his piece , a few heads of home - grown lettuce will not fix the gigaton - scale climate problem , which is driven by exploding energy appetites in a world where coal and oil remain the fuels of convenience .
Nonetheless , this summer I ’m determined to be a bit more diligent about our weed - choked garden plot and rather overgrown blackberry patch .
The article on the other end of the food spectrum , by my friend and science - writing colleague John Schwartz , brings word that animal - rights campaigners are so enamored with the idea of meat grown in laboratories instead of on the flanks of animals raised for slaughter that they ’re offering a bounty to spur innovation .
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is unveiling plans on Monday for a $ 1 million prize to the “ first person to come up with a method to produce commercially viable quantities of in vitro meat at competitive prices by 2012 . ”
As I wrote following the first international conference on vat - grown meat , there are big technical and public - relations hurdles to surmount before Burger King is selling lab - grown quarter pounders .
Still , if someone does come up with a resource - efficient ( low energy , low water ) way to grow muscle tissue and turn it into something tasty , it might be possible for a growing population to have its environment , climate , conscience , and meatballs , too .
But , boy , that sure is a different vision than the one laid out by Michael Pollan ( actually , I ’d love to hear his thoughts on humane , low - carbon meat ) .
I ’ll send a note and links to John ’s news story and my recent post .

Toshiba has halted production of HD DVD players and recorders and is close to making a decision on whether to throw in the towel on the high - definition movie disc format , Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Saturday evening .
The decision , which NHK said will likely cost the company several tens of billions of dollars , is being made in the face of flagging support by movie studios and major U.S. retailers .
" We are making considerations following the impact on sales of Warner 's announcement but we have n't made any decision , " said Keisuke Ohmori , a spokesman for Toshiba , when reached on Saturday evening .
He was referring to the January decision by Warner Bros to stop issuing movies on HD DVD and go solely with Blu-ray Disc .
Other local media reports on Saturday said an official announcement from Toshiba is likely in the coming week .
HD DVD has been battling Blu-ray Disc for just under two years to become the defacto replacement for DVD for high - definition video .
HD DVD is backed by Toshiba and a handful of other companies including Microsoft and Intel but Blu-ray Disc counted a larger number of consumer electronics heavy hitters .
The main backer of the format is Sony and other supporters include Panasonic , Sharp , Samsung , LG and Philips .
Both formats delivered a similar audio and video quality and the main difference comes down to the movies available on each format .
Most movie studios have taken one side or the other so consumers are left with a difficult decision .
As a result many have walked away from stores with neither an HD DVD or Blu-ray Disc player and the market has performed poorly .
The Warner Bros decision in January has been seen by many as the beginning of the end for HD DVD .
With Warner pulling out HD DVD only two of the major Hollywood studios , Paramount and Universal , are left backing the format .
In the weeks since the Warner announcement things have gotten worse for HD DVD .
In the last week Netflix , an Internet - based movie rental company in the U.S. , said it would cease supporting HD DVD and then on Friday Wal - Mart , the largest retailer in the U.S. , said it would stop selling HD DVD in favor of Blu-ray Disc .
A summary of Maggie Mahar 's summary of a talk by Uwe Reinhardt on the source of rising health care costs .
As noted here many times , an aging population is not the problem , it 's a combination of technological innovation and rising labor costs :
The Mythology of Boomers Bankrupting Our Healthcare System , by Maggie Mahar , Alternet : ... [ D]eveloped countries share many of the same problems .
One that stands out is the fact that our populations are aging .
Each country faces the same question :
How will a shrinking work force possibly pay for the medicine their nations ' retirees will need ?
This brings me to Princeton economist Uwe Reinhardt 's speech ... on what he called " the folklore that people bring to the healthcare policy table . "
By nature an iconoclast , Reinhardt spent the next 20 minutes shattering some ... myths ...
Begin with the notion that an aging population is a major factor driving healthcare inflation .
In the United States this is accepted ...
Bad news is often more gripping than good news , and " if you want to be a popular speaker , you need to feed the paranoia of your audience , " Reinhardt observed , pointing to the first slide of his PowerPoint presentation -- a chart illustrating just how quickly we can expect a horde of wrinkly boomers to take over the nation .
... [ Note : the slides are shown in the Alternet article . ]
A second slide is even more distressing , revealing that healthcare spending on patients over 75 averages about five times what we spend on 40 - year - olds .
Yet the next graph that Reinhardt offers is a little puzzling .
Here , we see that the United States spends close to $ 7,000 per person on care -- even though its population is younger than the citizens of most developed countries ...
Meanwhile , Japan 's population has been graying for some time , yet it spends only $ 1,000 per person .
Could eating fish really make that much difference ?
Reinhardt 's next graph provides the explanation .
It turns out that when you look at estimates of growth in healthcare spending from 1990 to 2030 , a senescent citizenry plays only a minor role in the projected jump from $ 585 billion ( what we laid out for healthcare in 1990 ) to $ 14,026 billion ( what analysts say we 'll ante up in 2030 ... ) .
What will be the biggest factor pushing the tab so much higher ?
Innovation .
" The healthcare industry will continue developing new stuff for every age group , " Reinhardt explains .
Will that " new stuff " -- in the form of new drugs , devices , tests and procedures -- be worth it ?
Some of it will be .
Some wo n't .
...
In many areas , we seem to have reached a point of diminishing returns .
This also is true in the drug industry , where most new entries are " me too drugs " -- little different from products already on the market .
" In truth , the aging of the population is not a big problem , " Reinhardt says .
...
This does n't mean that healthcare spending wo n't continue to levitate .
" But what will drive costs in coming years , will come , not from the demand side of the equation , but from the supply side , " ...
We can be certain that , without some significant reforms , suppliers will continue to invent new products for every age group , charging us more and selling us more -- using whatever methods it takes , from direct - to - consumer advertising to promises of near immortality and perpetual youth ... -- if we just swallow enough pills and replace enough body parts .
...
Moreover , healthcare is labor intensive ....
We are already experiencing a shortage of registered nurses -- which has helped raise wages .
...
Looking ahead , we 'll probably need 50 percent more nurses than we employed in 2000 .
...
So between the endless inventiveness of those who would overmedicate us to the unavoidable costs of a labor - intensive industry in an aging society , it is the supply side of medicine that is likely to push prices higher .
This , says Reinhardt , is what policymakers should be thinking about .
But , he emphasizes , it does n't have to happen .
" If we begin to purge our healthcare system of Waste , Fraud and Abuse , " we could save billions ...
And when it comes to caring for the elderly , he suggests , " If we develop healthcare information technology , we could use it to monitor seniors in their homes -- instead of in nursing homes . "
This is just one example of how the United States could bring costs down on the supply side .
In addition , Medicare could use its clout to negotiate for lower drug and device prices -- just as other nations do .
We could become more discriminating about what we buy from the healthcare industry 's suppliers ...
Finally , Sweden offers proof that an aging population does n't have to spell financial disaster .
... [ the post goes on to discuss Sweden 's health care system ... ]
It sounds like a sci - fi cliché , but it is possible for one 's cat to be radioactive , particularly after certain medical procedures - iodine treatment for a hyperthyroid condition is the most common .
If your cat has been pumped full of a radioactive isotope ( like radioiodine ) , there are a few things to consider :
You might want to kennel the cat for the first two weeks of the detoxification period , when the cat is the most radioactive .
The cat 's going to be miserable either way , but in a kennel you wo n't have to listen to the poor thing complain .
It 'll get over it .
If you do bring it home and have other cats , keep them completely separated .
The radioactive cat will be sweating iodine through its pores and allowing it to mingle with other cats is a bad idea .
Be careful with the cat 's litter box , as the animal 's urine and feces will be radioactive .
Clean it frequently , and check your area 's regulations on the disposal of radioactive material .
No , I 'm not kidding - most places will forbid you to flush the waste and may require a special waste pick - up to take care of the stuff .
Oh , and wear gloves .
Do n't go anywhere near the cat if you 're pregnant .
Just do n't .
Do exactly what your vet tells you to do - most local governments do n't screw around when it comes to radioactivity and some pet owners have been hit with fairly hefty fines .
Be careful .
VANCOUVER , British Columbia ( Reuters ) - A Canadian man who claims he was discriminated against as a pagan who practices a form of sadomasochism will get to take his complaint to a human rights tribunal .
An appeals court rejected a bid by Vancouver police on Tuesday to block a hearing on whether Peter Hayes ’ rights were violated when an officer refused to grant him the permit he needed to get a chauffeur ’s job .
Hayes complained to British Columbia ’s Human Rights Tribunal that he was discriminated against because he is a pagan who practices a “ BDSM lifestyle ” and deserves protection under the human rights code , based on sexual orientation .
BDSM refers to bondage , discipline and submission and sadism and masochism , according to the court documents .
Police went to the courts , arguing the tribunal and a lower court judge erred in agreeing to hear Hayes ’ complaint because the laws designed to protect the sexual orientation of gays and lesbians did not extend to protecting types of sexual practices .
A B.C. Court of Appeal panel ruled unanimously that the police motion was premature since the tribunal ’s hearing was to decide what , if any , sexual practices deserved legal protection , and even the tribunal ’s chairwoman was unsure if the human rights code did that .
“ How can the tribunal determine if BDSM falls within the meaning of ‘ sexual orientation ’ if it does not have a full understanding of what BDSM means ? ” Justice Anne Rowles wrote for the three - judge panel .
When Saving Money Goes Extreme : Serious Savers Who Died Very Wealthy
How to become a millionaire by saving money to the extreme .
While there are people who love to flaunt whatever they have and give the impression that they are wealthier than they truly are , there ’s this subset of individuals who work in completely the opposite way : these people are the ones who are wealthier than anyone ever suspects , and are only discovered as millionaires right after they have passed away and have bequeathed their millions to others .
I ’ve always been quite inspired by such people , but also wondered about what would possess them to hoard money in this manner .
More often than not , it ’s an issue of control , with “ pack rat like ” behavior extending to money as being the object of choice to squirrel away in this extreme fashion .
Saving Money Goes Extreme : Stories Of The Unexpectedly Rich
These people have been called many things — from rich paupers , to millionaire eccentrics , to the “ surprisingly rich ” .
Here are some accounts of people who ’ve lived under the radar while secretly stashing away their money .
They ’re living a double life .
I do n’t know about you , but I find this somewhat cool and intriguing .
Joseph Leek left nearly $ 1.8 million to an organization that provides guide dogs for the blind , and nobody , not even his own family , had any idea that he had that kind of money .
The 90 - year - old Britisher lived like a pauper .
He watched television at a neighbor ’s house to save on electricity , put off home repairs , and bought secondhand clothes .
Rev. Vertrue Sharp raised hay and cattle , preached and taught , while saving every penny he made .
When he died in 1999 , he left an estate of $ 2 million to the East Tennessee Children ’s Hospital , the University of Tennessee Medical Center , and other charities .
English spinster , Mary Guthrie Essame was a retired nurse who lived in an old Victorian house and who clad herself in such worn clothes and old shoes that no one knew how well off she was .
Neighbors were shocked to learn that her estate amounted to a whopping $ 10 million when she died in January 2002 .
( The money was left to a host of charities . )
Have you heard about the elementary school teacher who built up almost $ 4 million dollars by the age of 89 ?
There was also the 55 year old transient who lived in a trash - filled hotel room who had $ 1.4 million in Wachovia stocks and funds because he was afraid “ his health would go bad ” and that he needed to ensure he ’d get medical attention when the need arose .
And here ’s my favorite story of all :
Joe Temeczko was a Polish immigrant and former prisoner of war who did odd jobs and handyman repair work .
He had no family and lived in a modest house which he filled with stuff he scavenged from the streets .
He roamed the neighborhood to find junk to fix up and sell or give away , and would get free food from local charities and read newspapers in the store so he would n’t have to buy them .
When he passed away at the age of 86 , he left behind a $ 1.4 million bank account which he gifted to the City of New York .
In fact , he ’d rewritten his will right after 9/11 .
Interesting Notes About The Secretly Wealthy
There are more people of this profile than you think .
Do n’t look now but the shabby clothed guy standing in the corner can be worth millions .
A lot of these folks become philanthropists and leave the bulk of their money to charity .
They are ordinary people who want to make a difference in society , and who ’ve done it in a special way — by allowing their money to grow throughout the years , enabling them to bequeath a large gift to their causes and helping them make an impact upon death .
On the other hand , family members of the secretly wealthy have also voiced their disappointment in finding out that they ’re actually richer than they thought they were .
Many have lived lives of sacrifice and deprivation affected by the lack of knowledge about their true financial status .
This true status is a closely guarded secret by the patron ( or matron ) of the family throughout their lifetime .
Not surprisingly , this can trigger a backlash among the heirs , who may then proceed to spend their inheritance willy nilly .
Many of the secretly wealth are actually quite happy and content just living the way they do ( as reported by those close to them ) , although I ’m rather baffled that anyone would like to live in flea - bitten hotels , seemingly poverty - stricken , when they could afford a decent apartment .
Keeping one ’s riches secret has been looked upon as a control issue , although these extreme frugalists appear to have the common desire to surprise their heirs when they die .
For those who pretend to be poorer than they are , it could be due to having the baglady anxiety syndrome , where they feel that no matter how much they have , it can all be gone in a split second if an emergency arises .
Or they may just feel more comfortable hiding their wealth so that it could grow uninterrupted , away from prying eyes and others ’ involvement .
They may also enjoy and derive pleasure from the idea that they can become the “ hero ” once they die and leave a legacy to others .
Odd behaviors aside , these stories should prove one thing : that ordinary people CAN indeed find themselves sitting on millions by simply living frugally .
Though I can hear you all making the argument that a lot of these folks are found to be millionaires only after many , many years of scrimping and only upon reaching the twilight of their lives , you really can’t argue with the hard results : they still have a million dollars more than most of us have .

15,568 species now face extinction
NewScientist.com
The number of threatened species on the planet is increasing at unprecedented rates across almost all major animal groups , according to the most comprehensive evaluation of the world ’s biodiversity ever undertaken .
A total of 15,568 species now face extinction , according to the 2004 Red List of Threatened Species published on Wednesday by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) .
This represents a rise of 3300 species compared to the 2003 list .
One in three amphibians and almost half of all freshwater turtles are now threatened , as well as one in eight birds and a quarter of known mammals .
For the first time , the Red List includes an index that shows the overall change in threatened status and the projected risk of extinction for each particular species group .
The conclusion is that there is an even greater sense of urgency , says Simon Stuart at Conservation International , Washington DC , US .

The distinctive rostrum of the Largetooth sawfish often becomes entangled in West Pacific fishing nets
Callum Rankine , international species officer for the World Wildlife Fund , agrees : “ Year - on - year we know that the situation is getting worse , but this time it just seems to be getting worse much faster . "
New to science
There is still much to be understood about key species - rich habitats , such as tropical forests , marine and freshwater systems , says Craig Hilton - Taylor , one of the Red List ’s authors .
This is despite these appearing to be some of the ecologies most at risk .
For example , in Madagascar more than half the freshwater fish now face extinction .
One of these , a type of killifish which is so new to science it has not yet been formally named , used to live in what was the Sakaramyi River .
But this has now been diverted for domestic water supplies leaving the last remaining specimens of this fish existing in “ a handful of puddles ” , sustained only by poor plumbing .
“ If all the people in Madagascar fixed their taps , these fish would die out , ” Hilton - Taylor says .
Human geography
In addition to the list itself , the IUCN published results of a four - year analysis entitled the Global Species Assessment ( GSA ) which highlights problems not just in terms of biodiversity but also in terms of human geography and socioeconomics .
For example , although some countries like Australia , Brazil , Indonesia and Mexico have a disproportionately high number of species at risk , the number of threatened species is likely to increase more rapidly in regions where human population growth rates are high , such as in Cameroon or India .
“ This is the first time we have been able to overlay species distribution maps with population growth data , ” says Stuart , one of the authors of the GSA .
Habitat loss is by far the greatest threat to biodiversity but , in regions where human population growth is particularly high , “ the traditional protected area approach might not work ” , says Hilton - Taylor .
The challenge lies in finding ways to enable people living in poverty to develop a sustainable relationship with their local resources .
“ But it ’s extremely difficult to get these people to live sustainably , because often they are just concerned with trying to live , ” says Rankine .
The new data also offers the chance to identify countries for pre-emptive conservation initiatives .
In countries such as Bolivia , Papua New Guinea and Namibia , there is currently a low human population density but a high rate of population growth , which could threaten wildlife in the future .

Who do those stupid ass Liberal - commie frogs think they are ?.
Their lower on the food chain than people .
If they keep complaining about their trees getting cut down we 'll declare a ' war on frogs ' and we 'll bomb them into the stone age and stuff .
Then we 'll stick Anthrax from that military Anthrax place we got in the US ( you know where those anthrax letters came from ?
teehee , fooled yu's .
Then we 'll give them frogs to those left - wing tin foil head frenchies to eat , then they 'll die and then George Bush can take over the world !

You know you 're all alone
Your friends they are n't at home
Everybody 's gone to the garden
As you look into the trees
You can look but you do n't see
The flowers seem to tease you at the garden
Everybody 's there , but you do n't seem to care
What 's it with you man , and this garden
Turned into my worst phobia ,
A crazy man 's utopia
If you 're lost no one can show ya ,
But it sure was glad to know ya
Only poor boys take a chance ,
On the garden 's song and dance ,
Feel her flowers as they wrap around ,
But only smart boys do without
You can find it all inside
No need to wrestle with your pride
No you ai n't losin ' your mind
You 're just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself
Or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside
For the garden
I was n't really scared
Lost my virginity there ,
To a gypsy with blond hair
But now no one seems to care
Like a mouse inside a maze
Wandering round 4 daze
With a smile upon my face ,
I never wanna leave this place
Only poor boys take a chance ,
On the garden 's song and dance ,
Feel her flowers as they wrap around ,
But only smart boys do without
Turned into my worst phobia ,
A crazy man 's utopia
If you 're lost no one can show ya ,
But it sure was glad to know ya
Bye bye
So long , bye bye
It 's glad to know ya
Bye bye
Bye bye
Aw ... so long

What all the knee - jerk humanists fail to realize is that this object of their adoration , i.e. " civilization , " is far more fragile than the most robust elements of nature .
Sure , there are millions of fringe species that will disappear rapidly , but nature at its core is an all but infinite reservoir of adaptive potential , far more so than weakling humans .
Cockroaches , rats , slime - molds , and common weeds can scrape out an existence under climatic conditions far below the minimum requirements of civilization , and if we keep pushing our " only humans matter " bullshit , we 're going to watch this very truth unfold .
In what will be a grand irony , the most overbred , least fit humans , i.e. the Ruling Pig class , will then become the sole survivors , because they 'll push everyone else over the edge to save themselves .
We 'll know this day has arrived when genetically altered pneumonic Ebola , etc. , " mysteriously " breaks out everywhere , even as a whole new class of servant robots suddenly emerges to take our place .
This obscene parasitic scum will be so fucking doomed , ha ha !
Instead of taking the sensible and just route of reverting to " primitive " folkways , these connoisseurs of hubris will resort to more and more extreme and entropically unstable means of maintaining the surreal luxury on which they 're utterly dependent .
This will only deepen the present pattern of techno - stupidity .
Picture actual bubble - cities with robots everywhwere , all run on -- oh goody -- nuclear energy .
When their much - deserved extinction finally arrives , these weird mewling fetus - things will be sobbing with relief .
Then a liberated earth will finally heal itself .

Hi Vox , Just glad to see that you are back posting .
I thought maybe the fascists had gotten to you somehow .
FACT : The planet is going into hyper - change mode at the same time the oil is running out for the old technology .
NOBODY knows anything about the future anymore because the rate of change is so fast and the data is all so new every moment that even the weather is now completely unpredictable .
SAME goes for human behavior and geopolitics .
NONE of the old models hold .
Love your brothers and sisters .
Keep your feet on the ground if you can and do n't waste time FIGHTING with imbeciles .
Respectfully , A&P .

We are at a point in time / space where evolution and de-evolution are running about the same rate .
The Cyber - Culture Future Historian speaks of is already here .
The Chip - Mobile is already putting implants in people because , well , it is simply there .
Cybernetics might not be a bad thing if not for hidden lower reptilian consciousness still hiding beneath the threashold of human consciousness .
People are taught to accept death as something better than biological immortality .
This is the only strength of religion .
If we had infinite space to evolve , then maybe , just maybe , the confines of gravity would not have such a disastrous effect on earthbound species .
Oh , Angry and Prepared , I agree 100 % , although I do occasionally like putting dopes in their place with facts and logic .
Love will prevail in the end , that I know .

Dear Vox ,
Glad to see new activity on your site .
Please give us an update as to your situation over the last few months .
It seems as though things came crashing down when you announced the radio program ( which I was never able to find ) in the summer .
I see the monitors are still at work .
By the way , the text of the article and comments is seen on my browser in the palest of greys , hardley legible , so it seems like they are still messing with you .
Hope all is well .

The US $ is in a free fall as the US goes into record debt to pay Halliburton ( Cheney ) , Bechtel ( Rumsfeld ) and Carlyle ( Bush , Bin Laden , Blair ) .
The US is the biggest threat to world peace and the world is ganging up to fight back .

A key concept in brainwashing is to communicate directly to the reptilian brain ( hippocampus ) using emotional words .
The " invasion and occupation of Iraq " becomes the " war on terror " and the sheeple can't figure out why the rest of the world is so pissed off at them .
Remember Ronald Reagan's " freedom fighters " in Afghanistan , who fought valiantly to stop the Russian invasion ?
We 've conveniently renamed them " Al Quaeda Terrorists " .
Al Quaeda is like the boogey man - really scary until you realise he is n't real .

" ... NOBODY knows anything about the future anymore because the rate of change is so fast and the data is all so new every moment ... SAME goes for human behavior and geopolitics .

Simply not true .
For as long as civilization 's existed , its defining pattern has been the pursuit of ever larger strategies of parasitism by the ruling class as a discrete group toward the totality of life , including other humans .
The implications of this pattern for the future of humanity and the earth are very clear , and the " advancement " of technology has done absolutely nothing to modify this dynamic , other than broadening and deepening it .
Technology as a reality is eclipsed by the primal human motivations that spawn it .
Certain " primitive " bloodlines , e.g. Native Americans , have possessed the magnificence of spirit necessary to clearly see civilization 's self - extincting destiny , but of course civilization has sought to exterminate such people along with their insights , leaving only morbidly fearful boob - hangers , for whom civilization 's overriding promise is that they can remain infantile indefinitely .
This appeal to their impaired psychology totally cancels any ability to generate a meaningful critique .
Their faith in civilization is exactly like a fetus ' faith in the womb : absolute , perfectly invulnerable to analysis , because any such analysis would first of all depend on alien experiences and profoundly latent intellectual capacities .
" The Cyber - Culture Future Historian speaks of is already here . "
Oh really ?
My prediction involved the Supreme Psychopaths wiping out everyone else to alleviate population pressure .
If this has indeed come to pass , why are there still Haitians ?
Why is everyone you know still here ?
" Cybernetics might not be a bad thing ... biological immortality ...
If we had infinite space to evolve ... "
So , in your need to dismiss my initial post , you technodreamers have brought out the " big guns " of your favorite diseased fantasies , i.e. immortality and space colonization .
Ya know , it 's a really grim sign of how deeply fucked the human race is when even Vox readers can't think freely enough to see past all the techno - utopian horseshit shoveled at them by Popular Science magazine .
There has yet to be a single solid indication that space colonization represents a viable future for the human race .
Until such an indication arrives , and so far this is looking like the biggest longshot ever , bio -engineered immortality would be a singularly stupid idea .
Yah , you wanna live forever , you 're going to want to pop out a kid every so often , also free of chronological or numerical limits , and you 're also gonna want THEM to live forever and do the same .
Why am I the only person I know who can foresee how psychotic this population scenario is ?
You featherweight punks badly need to avail yourselves of a certain itsy bitsy subject called 'P - O - P - U-L - A - T - I - O - N D-Y- N - A - M - I -C - S . '
One of the all - time great works , Thomas Malthus ' ' Population Theory , ' can be found right here on Vox 's home page , upper right .
Much as civilizationists despise Malthus ' 250 - year - old ruminations , his work remains essential because they never truly succeed in refuting him , they just love imagining they have .
What your position actually amounts to is that we should pursue space - faring immortality because you 're too fucking chicken to face the necessity of your own death .
That 's the religionists ' crippling weakness , as well , so put the blame where it belongs , already .
This ' solution ' of yours would solve jack shit , because the real problem here is the turd - like supine squishiness of your own intellect , which would now merely continue perpetually .
What causes you to imagine the Rockefellers would save a spot for you on their spaceship , anyway ?
Meanwhile , the REAL world that sustains you in every way sickens and dies for lack of attention ...
There is simply nothing visionary to be found in this techno - delusional rebuttal of yours , which in fact represents severe intellectual flabbiness , symptomatic of a person too weak to face immense realities staring them implacably in the face , many of which are clearly immutable .
Physical law , for example .
My diagnosis is not diminished in any way by the fact that everyone you know is as weak - minded and delusional as yourself ; this only speaks to the sadly narcissistic state of the average American intellect .
After spending 10,000 hours playing video games over the past decade , you pathetic cyber - vegetables have simply mistaken them for reality .
" Love will prevail in the end , that I know . "
Uh-huh , " Love Conquers All , " r - i - i - i - i - i-ight .
How odd , then , that for 5,000 + years the people who view your existence as a tradable commodity have been getting such superb results from their hatred of all things plebeian , which has almost never been directed against them in kind .
Maybe as a first step to actually fixing the world , you should stop puking forth the exact same sentimental idiocies installed in your head by their pseudo - spiritual church operatives .
Or you can not fix it and just die , you and them alike .
That would probably be best .
They , believe it or not , are fucked up even worse than you ; the present dire prognosis for the planet is a testament to their mental disease .

Yo Vox :
You 're awfully silent since you re-opened your forum .
Cat got your tongue ?
I can only conclude that this page is now being used by the Feds to capture names for the soon to be released " amoral enemies of the state list . "
If only they would just ask politely , I would be glad to provide them with the names of all my like - minded anarchist friends .

To Future Historian : Having just read your posting above , I can't begin to express my dismay .
Imagine , there exists among the weak , feeble - minded , religionist fucks who inhabit this site an actual man ( woman ? ) of reason .
We MUST talk .
I came upon this site about a year ago and thought that unlike the Renses , Joneses , Rupperts , et al , I had reason to be hopeful that the entity formerly known as Voxfux was , potentially , a man of both reason and ACTION .
Unfortunately , this proved not to be the case .
The only reason for my occasional visit ( other than to let the host of this site know what I thought of him subsequent to the end of our private correspondence ) is an endeavor to locate rational human beings who may share my world view and may have an interest in actually doing something to veer the course of humanity from the current path of self - destruction .
I know , this site is hardly a sea of enlightened humankind from which to fish .
And yes , I am acutely aware of the folly of my aspirations .
However , regardless of my success or lack thereof , one must begin at the beginning .
Having given up on vox after reading an account of him tooling around Alex Jones in his " cigarette boat at the RNC , I was resigned to the fact that this site was no longer worthy of my continued perusal .
Until now , that is .
If you feel as passionately as I do that all the significant advances in societal evolution have sprung from the minds of a handful of individuals who refused to accept the status quo and were certain in their belief that they could create a more perfect world , than we need each other desperately .
I have plans and means .
Are you interested ?

The end of the week is nigh .
You have worked hard and now it 's time to relax .
That is the spirit behind the new " Thank Giz It 's Friday " roundup .
This week it is all about gadgets that will help you breeze through the weekend with as little physical effort as possible — a guide to the ultimate in laziness .
The way I see it , why should you do things half - assed when you can do things no -assed ?
Let us show you the way .

After you wake up promptly at 1 p.m. , you will probably need to make the bed .
Screw that .
Selfy the Easy Bed can do it for you using a motorized rail system .
You still have to push a button with it though , which is one step too many if you ask me .
Might as well just leave it unmade .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
The next thing that you will probably need to do is hit the bathroom .
After all is said and done , the Neorest AH Tankless toilet will wash and dry your ass after use .
Does n't get much better than that my friends .
Oh wait , yes it does : it also cleans itself and saves water in the process .
That kind of laziness does n't come cheap though .
One of these beauties will set you back $ 4000 .

By this time the dog is probably antsy to go out and play .
If you had a homemade tennis ball cannon like the dude in this video , that would be no problem at all .

You may have noticed a little extra flab here and there , so it might be a good time to hit the gym or go for a run .
Nah .
Too lazy for that .
I mean , why work for six pack abs when you can pay for them ?
For $ 4,000 - $ 7,000 you can undergo abdominal etching surgery for that cut look .
However , if you have a body like John Goodman , a six pack on a huge gut may not look right .

Yardwork on the weekends can be a real pain in the ass , especially if you have a big lawn .
With Husqvarna 's Autonomous Solar Powered Lawnmower , you wo n't ever have to mow again .
Just program it to do your bidding and let it handle all of the hard work .
It even cuts the grass short enough that you do n't have to bother with bagging — and it charges itself when the work is done .
Priced at around $ 4000 US .

While you are sitting on the porch watching the Husqvarna mow your yard , have a seat and take a load off .
And do n't worry about getting up .
This chair can walk for you using a sophisticated mechanism under the seat .
Unfortunately , I do n't think many lazy folks could afford to drop around $ 23,000 on a chair .

Alright , the chores are done and now it is time to eat dinner .
Unfortunately , all of that microwaving has left you feeling a bit tired .
If the thought of having to manually season your food is too much to bear , a set of these Movers & Shakers should do the trick .
Just pull on the cord and they will dispense your condiments for you .
Available for $ 9.95 .

Claim : Video shows a suspect in a police shooting committing suicide in an interview room .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , 2004 ]
Is this video real ?
Is this video real ?
GRAPHIC IMAGE WARNING : Video shows a suicide by gunshot .
Origins : Movies and television have planted sensationalized images of certain phenomena into the public consciousness , to the extent that when most of us see the real thing , we ’re disappointed that it seems so mundane .
In films and television programs , automobile crashes are always slam - bang affairs that inevitably end with one or more cars bursting into flame and exploding ; thunder is always a very loud , sharp , and short report which occurs simultaneously with a bolt of lightning ( rather
than a slow , distant , gradually increasing rumbling which arrives well after the lightning flash ) ; and gunshots are usually depicted as producing ear - splitting volumes of sound and , when aimed at another human being , resulting in plenty of gore and splatter .
It ’s no wonder , then , that when the above - displayed video of a detainee shooting himself while in police custody began to circulate , many viewers were skeptical of its authenticity — by Hollywood standards , it ’s so tame as to be almost surreal .
As depicted in the video , an uncuffed suspect enters an interrogation room and sits down in a chair , followed by an officer who dumps some keys and sunglasses on a table , checks his cell phone , and leaves the room momentarily .
The officer returns several seconds later with a bottle of water and a cup of coffee , then hands the water bottle to the suspect , checks his cell phone again , picks up the coffee , and exits the room a second time — leaving the suspect alone and unrestrained , and the door open .
The suspect takes a couple of swigs of water , then calmly reaches into his pants with his other hand , pulls out a large - caliber handgun , and shoots himself in the left temple .
But what we see in the video is nothing like what most of us might expect .
The soon - to - be suicide victim is neither visibly nervous nor distraught as he freely pulls out a gun and places it against his head .
( He even replaces the cap on the water bottle before pulling the trigger . )
The weapon does not produce an ear - shattering concussive
sound in the small room , blood and brain matter do n’t splatter all over the walls , and the victim ’s body is n’t hurtled out of the chair and onto the floor .
The gun makes a sharp popping sound as the suspect shoots himself , blood streams from the victim ’s head and mouth , his hands drop the gun and water bottle to the floor , and his body slumps but slightly in the chair .
Even more unusual to many viewers is the officer ’s reaction to this event .
He does n’t respond with any of the emotions most of us might feel , such as fear , panic , terror , or disgust .
Nor does he rush to the victim ’s aid , check him for signs of life , summon help , or otherwise raise an alarm .
“ Oh , fuck , ” he exclaims as he re-enters the room , puts his coffee down on the table , and surveys the scene for a second or two , then adds “ Holy fuck . ”
When a second ( unseen ) officer inquires “ What did he do ? ” he responds with , “ Nobody shook him ” ( i.e. , nobody searched the suspect for weapons ) , then calmly retrieves the keys and sunglasses and leaves the room .
Throughout the short video , the officer ’s actions seem almost nonchalant : he does n’t act the least bit shocked or horrified that a human being has just died a violent death right in front of him .
Instead , the foremost thought on his mind seems to be concern that someone ’s going to get into big trouble for the oversight of allowing a detainee to retain a weapon .
( We realize , of course , that all of this would be viewed quite differently from a police perspective .
Officers undergo thorough instruction in the handling and use of firearms , they generally see far more blood and violence on the job than most of us will experience in our lifetimes , and they ’re trained to respond to emergency situations by following proper procedure rather than reacting with fear or panic .
We ’re simply presenting the average person ’s reaction to this video , as reflected in the e-mail we ’ve received from readers who have viewed it . )
The circumstances behind this video took place on 19 December 2003 , when 47 - year - old Ricardo Alfonso Cerna was stopped for a traffic violation at about 9:30 A.M. in Muscoy ( a residential suburb of San Bernardino County , about 60 miles east of Los Angeles ) .
Cerna fled the scene ( in his car and then on foot ) before shooting the pursuing officer , sheriff ’s deputy Michael Parham , twice in the abdomen .
( Deputy Parham survived the shooting . )
Cerna was soon arrested by San Bernardino police and taken to sheriff ’s headquarters on Third Street , where he was placed in an interview room just before 11 A.M. in preparation for questioning by Bobby Dean , head of the San Bernardino County sheriff ’s homicide unit .
When Dean stepped out of the room briefly to speak with a detective in the hallway , Cerna pulled the .45 - caliber handgun out of his pants and shot himself in the head .
Evidently a chain of mistakes led to Cerna , a shooting suspect , being taken into custody without either the arresting officers or the booking officers discovering he had a large , heavy handgun concealed on his person :
[ Sheriff Gary ]
Penrod said deputies failed to adequately search Cerna before he was put in a car , and again when he was transferred to the homicide division office .
Each receiving deputy may have wrongly assumed the previous officer adequately searched the man , he said .
[ Sheriff Gary ]
Penrod said deputies failed to adequately search Cerna before he was put in a car , and again when he was transferred to the homicide division office .
Each receiving deputy may have wrongly assumed the previous officer adequately searched the man , he said .
Penrod said confusion among the three agencies involved — the Highway Patrol , San Bernardino police and the Sheriff ’s Department — may have contributed to the oversight .
“ Obviously there was a mistake made , ” Penrod said by phone .
“ It was hectic and it was a guy who was cuffed by somebody other than the transporting officer .
( This apparently egregious oversight led to conspiracy - theory speculation in some quarters that Cerna had been “ executed ” by the San Bernardino Sheriff ’s Department , or that the sheriff returned the gun to Cerna and urged him to commit suicide with it — the completely implausible scenario of officers ’ deliberately handing a loaded gun to a suspect who had already shot one policeman notwithstanding . )
As to how the video of Cerna ’s suicide made it onto the Internet , sheriff ’s spokesman Chip Patterson said :
[ A ] ranking official at the department was authorized to show the video during a presentation on officer safety at the FBI ’s training academy in Quantico , Va. , several months ago .
[ A ] ranking official at the department was authorized to show the video during a presentation on officer safety at the FBI ’s training academy in Quantico , Va. , several months ago .
Following the presentation , dozens of copies of the video were made at the request of law - enforcement agencies across the country .
Officials of those agencies wanted the copies for training purposes .
Sheriff ’s officials do not know who might have leaked the video to the public .
Some of the officers involved in Cerna ’s arrest and handling were subjected to disciplinary action , but sheriff ’s officials would n’t comment on the specifics of that action or identify the officers involved .

The full text of tonight 's State of the Union speech to be delivered by President Bush , as prepared for delivery , per Think Progress .
# STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS As Prepared for Delivery Madam Speaker , Vice President Cheney , Members of Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow citizens :
Seven years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum .
In that time , our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined .
We have faced hard decisions about peace and war , rising competition in the world economy , and the health and welfare of our citizens .
These issues call for vigorous debate , and I think its fair to say weve answered that call .
Yet history will record that amid our differences , we acted with purpose .
And together , we showed the world the power and resilience of American self - government .
All of us were sent to Washington to carry out the peoples business .
That is the purpose of this body .
It is the meaning of our oath .
And it remains our charge to keep .
The actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of our Nation long after this session has ended .
In this election year , let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them .
And let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time .
From expanding opportunity to protecting our country , we have made good progress .
Yet we have unfinished business before us , and the American people expect us to get it done .
In the work ahead , we must be guided by the philosophy that made our Nation great .
As Americans , we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history .
We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens .
So in all we do , we must trust in the ability of free people to make wise decisions , and empower them to improve their lives and their futures .
To build a prosperous future , we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy .
As we meet tonight , our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty .
America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months , but jobs are now growing at a slower pace .
Wages are up , but so are prices for food and gas .
Exports are rising , but the housing market has declined .
And at kitchen tables across our country , there is concern about our economic future .
In the long run , Americans can be confident about our economic growth .
But in the short run , we can all see that growth is slowing .
So last week , my Administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment .
The temptation will be to load up the bill .
That would delay it or derail it , and neither option is acceptable .
This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working .
And this Congress must pass it as soon as possible .
We have other work to do on taxes .
Unless the Congress acts , most of the tax relief we have delivered over the past 7 years will be taken away .
Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase .
Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $ 1,800 .
Others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes .
I welcome their enthusiasm , and I am pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and money orders .
Most Americans think their taxes are high enough .
With all the other pressures on their finances , American families should not have to worry about the Federal Government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks .
There is only one way to eliminate this uncertainty : make the tax relief permanent .
And Members of Congress should know :
If any bill raising taxes reaches my desk , I will veto it .
Just as we trust Americans with their own money , we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely .
Next week , I will send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs totaling more than $ 18 billion .
And this budget will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012 .
American families have to balance their budgets , and so should their Government .
The peoples trust in their Government is undermined by congressional earmarks  special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute , without discussion or debate .
Last year , I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half .
I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote .
Unfortunately , neither goal was met .
So this time , if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half , I will send it back to you with my veto .
And tomorrow , I will issue an Executive Order that directs Federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by the Congress .
If these items are truly worth funding , the Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote .
Our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending .
On housing , we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market .
My Administration brought together the HOPE NOW alliance , which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure .
The Congress can help even more .
Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , modernize the Federal Housing Administration , and allow State housing agencies to issue tax - free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages .
These are difficult times for many American families , and by taking these steps , we can help more of them keep their homes .
To build a future of quality health care , we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options .
We share a common goal : making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans .
The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice , not government control .
So I have proposed ending the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer .
This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions , and I call on the Congress to pass it this year .
The Congress must also expand health savings accounts , create Association Health Plans for small businesses , promote health information technology , and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits .
With all these steps , we will help ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctors office  not in the halls of Congress .
On education , we must trust students to learn if given the chance and empower parents to demand results from our schools .
In neighborhoods across our country , there are boys and girls with dreams  and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them .
Six years ago , we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act , and today no one can deny its results .
Last year , fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record .
Reading scores are on the rise .
And African - American and Hispanic students posted all - time highs .
Now we must work together to increase accountability , add flexibility for States and districts , reduce the number of high school dropouts , and provide extra help for struggling schools .
Members of Congress : The No Child Left Behind
Act is a bipartisan achievement .
It is succeeding .
And we owe it to Americas children , their parents , and their teachers to strengthen this good law .
We must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up .
Thanks to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarships you approved , more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our Nations capital have found new hope at a faith - based or other non-public school .
Sadly , these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of Americas inner cities .
So I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning .
And to open the doors of these schools to more children , I ask you to support a new $ 300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids .
We have seen how Pell Grants help low - income college students realize their full potential .
Together , we have expanded the size and reach of these grants .
Now lets apply that same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools .
On trade , we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas .
Today , our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods , crops , and services all over the world .
So we are working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can .
We are working for a successful Doha round of trade talks , and we must complete a good agreement this year .
At the same time , we are pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements .
I thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru .
Now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia , Panama , and South Korea .
Many products from these nations now enter America duty - free , yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets .
These agreements will level the playing field .
They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers .
And they will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world : those whose products say  Made in the USA . 
These agreements also promote Americas strategic interests .
The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia , a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers .
If we fail to pass this agreement , we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere .
So we must come together , pass this agreement , and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life .
Trade brings better jobs , better choices , and better prices .
Yet for some Americans , trade can mean losing a job , and the Federal Government has a responsibility to help .
I ask the Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance , so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs .
To build a future of energy security , we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology .
Our security , our prosperity , and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil .
Last year , I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade , and you responded .
Together we should take the next steps :
Let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions .
Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions - free nuclear power .
Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future .
Let us create a new international clean technology fund , which will help developing nations like India and China make greater use of clean energy sources .
And let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow , stop , and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases .
This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride .
The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change .
And the best way to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more efficient technology .
To keep America competitive into the future , we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow .
Last year , the Congress passed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative , but never followed through with the funding .
This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge .
So I ask the Congress to double Federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on earth .
On matters of science and life , we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries .
In November , we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells .
This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life .
So we are expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research .
And as we explore promising avenues of research , we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves .
So I call on the Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices such as the buying , selling , patenting , or cloning of human life .
On matters of justice , we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says .
I have submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law , not the whim of the gavel .
Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed .
They are worthy of confirmation , and the Senate should give each of them a prompt up - or - down vote .
In communities across our land , we must trust in the good heart of the American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need .
Over the past 7 years , more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service .
Americans have volunteered in record numbers .
Charitable donations are higher than ever .
Faith - based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair , with newfound support from the Federal Government .
And to help guarantee equal treatment for faith - based organizations when they compete for Federal funds , I ask you to permanently extend Charitable Choice .
Tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the Gulf Coast .
America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region .
We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before .
And tonight I am pleased to announce that in April we will host this years North American Summit of Canada , Mexico , and the United States in the great city of New Orleans .
There are two other pressing challenges that I have raised repeatedly before this body , and that this body has failed to address : entitlement spending and immigration .
Every Member in this chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford .
And we all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path : massive tax increases , sudden and drastic cuts in benefits , or crippling deficits .
I have laid out proposals to reform these programs .
Now I ask Members of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and grandchildren .
The other pressing challenge is immigration .
America needs to secure our borders  and with your help , my Administration is taking steps to do so .
We are increasing worksite enforcement , we are deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings , we have effectively ended the policy of catch and release at the border , and by the end of this year , we will have doubled the number of border patrol agents .
Yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy .
This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm .
We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally .
Illegal immigration is complicated , but it can be resolved .
And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals .
This is the business of our Nation here at home .
Yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world .
Our foreign policy is based on a clear premise :
We trust that people , when given the chance , will choose a future of freedom and peace .
In the last 7 years , we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty .
We have seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections .
We have seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence .
We have seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban to choose a new president and a new parliament .
We have seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink- stained fingers and celebrating their freedom .
And these images of liberty have inspired us .
In the past 7 years , we have also seen images that have sobered us .
We have watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassins hand .
We have seen wedding guests in blood - soaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan , Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets , and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs .
And on a clear September day , we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant .
These horrific images serve as a grim reminder :
The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists  evil men who despise freedom , despise America , and aim to subject millions to their violent rule .
Since September 11 , we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists .
We will stay on the offense , we will keep up the pressure , and we will deliver justice to the enemies of America .
We are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century .
The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear .
Yet in this war on terror , there is one thing we and our enemies agree on :
In the long run , men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny .
That is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to people in Lebanon , Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and the Palestinian Territories .
And that is why , for the security of America and the peace of the world , we are spreading the hope of freedom .
In Afghanistan , America , our 25 NATO allies , and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country .
Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel , a nation that was once a safe haven for al Qaida is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school , new roads and hospitals are being built , and people are looking to the future with new hope .
These successes must continue , so we are adding 3,200 Marines to our forces in Afghanistan , where they will fight the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police .
Defeating the Taliban and al Qaida is critical to our security , and I thank the Congress for supporting Americas vital mission in Afghanistan .
In Iraq , the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty and to establish safe havens for attacks across the world .
One year ago , our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos .
So we reviewed our strategy and changed course .
We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq .
And we gave our troops a new mission : Work with Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people , pursue the enemy in its strongholds , and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country .
The Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened .
Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their country .
They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods , clearing out the terrorists , and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return .
And they saw our troops , along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that include Foreign Service Officers and other skilled public servants , coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life .
Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction , and they have the gratitude of our whole Nation .
The Iraqis launched a surge of their own .
In the fall of 2006 , Sunni tribal leaders grew tired of al Qaidas brutality and started a popular uprising called  The Anbar Awakening . 
Over the past year , similar movements have spread across the country .
And today , this grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists .
The government in Baghdad has stepped forward as well  adding more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year .
While the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains , the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just 1 year ago :
When we met last year , many said containing the violence was impossible .
A year later , high profile terrorist attacks are down , civilian deaths are down , and sectarian killings are down .
When we met last year , militia extremists  some armed and trained by Iran  were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq .
A year later , Coalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters .
And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country .
When we met last year , al Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq , and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country .
Today , it is al Qaida that is searching for safe passage .
They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held , and over the past year , we have captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq , including hundreds of key al Qaida leaders and operatives .
Last month , Osama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al Qaida and admitted that Coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq .
Ladies and gentlemen , some may deny the surge is working , but among the terrorists there is no doubt .
Al Qaida is on the run in Iraq , and this enemy will be defeated .
When we met last year , our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise .
Today , because of the progress just described , we are implementing a policy of return on success ,  and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come home .
This progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders .
This evening , I want to speak directly to our men and women on the frontlines .
Soldiers , Sailors , Airmen , Marines , and Coast Guardsmen :
In the past year , you have done everything we have asked of you , and more .
Our Nation is grateful for your courage .
We are proud of your accomplishments .
And tonight in this hallowed chamber , with the American people as our witness , we make you a solemn pledge :
In the fight ahead , you will have all you need to protect our Nation .
And I ask the Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops .
Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard .
They are not yet defeated , and we can still expect tough fighting ahead .
Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007 , while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy .
American troops are shifting from leading operations , to partnering with Iraqi forces , and , eventually , to a protective overwatch mission .
As part of this transition , one Army brigade combat team and one Marine Expeditionary Unit have already come home and will not be replaced .
In the coming months , four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit .
Taken together , this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home .
Any further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders .
General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in the disintegration of the Iraqi Security Forces , al Qaida - Iraq regaining lost ground , [ and ] a marked increase in violence .
Members of Congress : Having come so far and achieved so much , we must not allow this to happen .
In the coming year , we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they are making toward political reconciliation .
At the local level , Sunnis , Shia , and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives .
Progress in the provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad .
And we are seeing some encouraging signs .
The national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces .
The parliament recently passed both a pension law and de-Baathification reform .
Now they are debating a provincial powers law .
The Iraqis still have a distance to travel .
But after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence , reconciliation is taking place  and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future .
The mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our Nation .
But it is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed .
A free Iraq will deny al Qaida a safe haven .
A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible .
And a free Iraq will be a friend of America , a partner in fighting terror , and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world .
By contrast , a failed Iraq would embolden extremists , strengthen Iran , and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends , our allies , and our homeland .
The enemy has made its intentions clear .
At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them , al Qaidas top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in Washington .
My fellow Americans :
We will not rest either .
We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated .
We must do the difficult work today , so that years from now people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment , prevailed in a tough fight , and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer America .
We are also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land , where we have new cause for hope .
Palestinians have elected a president who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel .
Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful , democratic Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security .
This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem , I assured leaders from both sides that America will do , and I will do , everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year .
The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side - by - side in peace .
We are also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in Tehran .
Irans rulers oppress a good and talented people .
And wherever freedom advances in the Middle East , it seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose it .
Iran is funding and training militia groups in Iraq , supporting Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon , and backing Hamas efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land .
Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium , which could be used to create a nuclear weapon .
Our message to the people of Iran is clear :
We have no quarrel with you , we respect your traditions and your history , and we look forward to the day when you have your freedom .
Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear : Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment , so negotiations can begin .
And to rejoin the community of nations , come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions , stop your oppression at home , and cease your support for terror abroad .
But above all , know this : America will confront those who threaten our troops , we will stand by our allies , and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf .
On the homefront , we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country .
This is our most solemn duty .
We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since September 11 .
This is not for a lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy .
In the past 6 years , we have stopped numerous attacks , including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic .
Dedicated men and women in our Government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans .
These good citizens are saving American lives , and everyone in this chamber owes them our thanks .
And we owe them something more :
We owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe .
One of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications .
To protect America , we need to know who the terrorists are talking to , what they are saying , and what they are planning .
Last year , the Congress passed legislation to help us do that .
Unfortunately , the Congress set the legislation to expire on February 1 .
This means that if you do not act by Friday , our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger .
The Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted .
The Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America .
We have had ample time for debate .
The time to act is now .
Protecting our Nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military .
It also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair .
So America is using its influence to build a freer , more hopeful , and more compassionate world .
This is a reflection of our national interest and the calling of our conscience .
America is opposing genocide in Sudan and supporting freedom in countries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma .
America is leading the fight against global poverty , with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance .
We have also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account .
This program strengthens democracy , transparency , and the rule of law in developing nations , and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative .
America is leading the fight against global hunger .
Today , more than half the worlds food aid comes from the United States .
And tonight , I ask the Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world , so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine .
America is leading the fight against disease .
With your help , we are working to cut by half the number of malaria - related deaths in 15 African nations .
And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 million people .
We can bring healing and hope to many more .
So I ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success .
And I call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting HIV / AIDS by approving an additional $ 30 billion over the next 5 years .
America is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people , and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us .
We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace .
Over the past 7 years , we have increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent .
As we increase funding , we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation .
I call on the Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala , so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope , promise , and dignity .
Our military families also sacrifice for America .
They endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home .
We have a responsibility to provide for them .
So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to childcare , creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the Federal Government , and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children .
Our military families serve our Nation , they inspire our Nation , and tonight our Nation honors them .
The secret of our strength , the miracle of America , is that our greatness lies not in our Government , but in the spirit and determination of our people .
When the Federal Convention met in Philadelphia in 1787 , our Nation was bound by the Articles of Confederation , which began with the words ,  We the undersigned delegates . 
When Gouverneur Morris was asked to draft the preamble to our new Constitution , he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our Nation and the history of the world :  We the people . 
By trusting the people , our Founders wagered that a great and noble Nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women .
By trusting the people , succeeding generations transformed our fragile young democracy into the most powerful Nation on earth and a beacon of hope for millions .
And so long as we continue to trust the people , our Nation will prosper , our liberty will be secure , and the State of our Union will remain strong .
So tonight , with confidence in freedoms power , and trust in the people , let us set forth to do their business . #

Difference between Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates ?
I 've given presentations on " creating passionate users " at both Amazon and Microsoft.
2 big companies , 2 CEOs .
Guess which CEO has been to the talk ?
And he did n't just sit there , he participated .
His hand shot up when I asked a question .
He quit fondling his Blackberry .
But far more importantly - - he asked an amazing question .
And it was a question I can't imagine being asked by Bill Gates , even in the alternate universe where Bill Gates WOULD choose to see a talk on " creating passionate users . "
So there he was , Jeff Bezos , third row .
( The talk he came to was at O'Reilly 's Foo Camp , not the one I did at Amazon . )
I tried to imagine what he was doing there .
You 're Jeff f'n Bezos .
More than 10,000 people work for you .
You 're building a space ship !
After the talk , Jeff came up ( patiently waiting his turn ) and said he was really going to think hard about the implications of the some of the things we talked about , especially the part on levels and rewards .
Then he asked , " How can I do more for our reviewers ?
These people do so much , and work so hard -- especially the ones who do a lot of reviews -- and the ' Top [ some number ] Reviewer ' badges are not enough . "
I was speechless .
Not because I could n't think of an answer , but because I could n't believe someone this far up the food chain would even think -- let alone care about this .
My talk is geared toward -- and usually attended by -- founders of tiny start - ups , not Big Company CEOs .
[ Visualize me doing one of those cartoon double - take head shake eye - pop things ]
But then I remembered my trip to Amazon , where Paul Graham gave a fabulous talk on what a company loses when it gets big , and how important it was to hang on to a start - up sensibility as you grow .
Paul said to the Amazon folks , " You 're a big company now , but how can you still act like a start - up in the ways that really matter . "
And there 's Jeff Bezos , doing exactly that .
Acting just like the enthusiastic start - up folks I usually see -- the ones whose chance for success hangs on their ability to make and keep users happy .
The ones who do n't have 10,000 other people to do it for them .
I have no idea if he thought about it ever again , and yes we all have our stories of bad Amazon customer service .
But the point is , Jeff Bezos , CEO , chose to spend time and attention on a talk about user passion .
And remember , what we ( and Jeff ) were talking about is at the implementation level , not some abstract concept of " we must be good to our customers . "
I believe most CEOs do care -- at least strategically -- about having happy users , but would n't waste a single synapse actually thinking about specific ways to make it happen .
So , to my original question on the difference between Jeff and Bill - - would Bill Gates attend a talk like this ?
( And I 'm not talking about my talk in particular , but anything -- by anyone -- on these kinds of user - happiness topics . )
Ask yourself , would your CEO choose to hear a talk on how to create passionate users ?
How about your upper - level managers ?
Anyone besides you ?
When I worked at Sun , I gave many lunch - time " brown - bag " talks on this over my 4 years , and it would never have occurred to me that , say , Scott McNealy might drop in .
Or any mid - to - upper - level manager .
( Although I 'm delighted that there are some kick - ass higher - up Sun folks I know now that are working on this ... but I had n't met any of them until recently . )
I did n't charge a fee to do this talk at Microsoft , or any other company that has convinced me they 'll take it seriously and try to make a difference .
I do n't do this for pay ; I do it because I believe it matters .
The problem is , the places it matters the most are the ones least likely to think about it .
No , they have too many other -- apparently more important -- things to think about .
And for the rest of us ?
That means there 's plenty of opportunities for small companies and start - ups that DO make user happiness ( not the same as " customer satisfaction " ) the top priority .
p.s. the question Jeff raised his hand on ( and answered ) was , " Who in popular culture speaks English without using contractions ? "
Jeff answered , correctly , " Data ! " ( thus reinforcing his geek cred ) .
If you want to know why that question -- and answer - - was relevant , you 'll have to read my earlier post on conversational language ; )

As much I < 3 Amazon and I </3 Microsoft , I have to say that Gates does have a reputation for dropping in to development planning meetings , having meticulously reviewed documents and such , and getting down into the details with designers and such .
This was a few years ago , but not that many .
I 'm not saying that the end result is all that good , but he does get down to implementation - level stuff .

So .. what was your answer to Jeff 's question ?
Posted by : Ross Hill | Feb 2 , 2007 9:52:34 PM
I 'm fresh out of grad school , so I can't help but think about how this applies to learning institutions .
For example , plenty of upper / middle management people in education believe that " we need to get more girls / women interested in science and engineering " -- but the people that really make the difference are the ones who light the fire under their own asses , and push themselves ( and others ) to answer the tough question -- HOW do we GET people passionate about something , how do we KEEP them passionate , and how do we FEED and NURTURE that passion .
I helped run a FIRST LEGO League event at my university for several years , and every year we would invite the Dean of the College of Engineering - and he always had " prior engagements " .
Well this year he came , and when he saw 1,000 middle school kids ( boys AND girls ) jumping and cheering for a bunch of LEGO robots , he was blown away .
I can only hope it got him to think , " what can I do to help " .
Thanks for the post Kathy - it 's good to hear a similar perspective on a different situation .

Bill Gates is only a software architect .
There are two kind of analysts :
* functional analysts ( marketers , commercials ) - people oriented
* technical analysts ( software architects ) - constrains oriented
This is why Gates is not so much about people , but about implementations .
It is not wrong , it is different .

I worked at Amazon and all that talk of Customer Obsession is absolutely NOT a joke -- Bezos breathes , lives , and evangelizes that mantra everyday .

Great subject !
For background : I 'm LDS and we have unpaid lay clergy .
The leader of the congregation is called a Bishop and he is regular member of the church with a regular full - time job typically .
When I moved to the Bay Area , the Bishop of my singles congregation was the billionaire Dick Peery .
On the very first Sunday I was there he met with me personally for about 20 minutes and really got to know all about me .
He never once forgot my name or anything about me .
He and his wife came to every party ( there are lots when you 're a single mormon ) and each time made an effort to come and chat with me .
I was no exception - he did this with everyone .
I 've seldom seen someone so passionate about his church calling - but it was more than that , you could tell that he was passionate about * us* personally .
He would have the whole congregation to his home all the time and would stay up into the wee hours of the morning making phone calls to us to make sure everything was going well .
He had put his business life on hold for the three years he served as the bishop .
Totally amazing guy - these folks who retain their down - to - earthedness despite their success are really the most impressive people to me .

Tony Hsieh , CEO , Zappos.com , said ( in regards to his hiring practice ) , " We want people who are passionate about what Zappos is about -- service .
I do n't care if they 're passionate about shoes . "
Zappos ' three - year growth ?
948 %
Amazon , and Zappos are places that empower and delight me .
I feel totally in control of my experiences there , which is why I return .
I 'm not a Microsoft basher , I think Bill Gates has done some phenominal things .
Customer service just is n't one of them .
Posted by : Karen Demerly | Feb 3 , 2007 7:33:08 AM
There are bad customer service experiences with Amazon ?
Except for the statistical law that , when you sell that much to that many people , sooner or later someone 's going to be unhappy , I 'm amazed to hear it .
As an avid English - reader living in Italy , I was probably more thrilled when I heard about Amazon than about any other thing that 's happened online before or since .
I 've been buying from them for 10 + years I guess .
And they 've NEVER let me down on customer service : they 've repeatedly replaced for free orders that went missing ( the Italian postal service is , uh , legendary ... ) .

Y'all are our invited guests , but if you 're being rude and obnoxious we 'll let the bouncer toss you .
So please , stick to debating and criticizing ideas rather than personal attacks . "
This seems ironic , do n't you think ?
I do n't think anyone can presume to know what Bill Gates would do , and it seems a gratuitous slam , beginning with the very title of thie piece , that is n't necessary to make what is otherwise a very good point .

I second Deirdré on Amazon 's service ( and on the Italian postal service , for that ) .

Should not compare apples to oranges .
CEO Jeff Bezos should be compared to CEO Steve Ballmer , not to Software Architect Bill Gates ( http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/bio.mspx ) .
Posted by : Mihaï | Feb 3 , 2007 12:12:17 PM
Thanks for the stories everyone .
Mihai : I have to disagree -- the comparison between Jeff and Bill IS oranges to oranges ... they are BOTH programming nerds , with a deep technical interest and background -- hacking , designing , etc .
And , Bill and Jeff are both the founders / visionaries of their companies , which is why I did n't use Balmer .
( yes , Bill Gates is not technically the CEO at this point , but actually -- I would be far less surprised to see Gates at something on user happiness than to see Steve Balmer ) .
But I also disagree with the notion that a topic like this does n't -- or should n't -- apply to a software engineer / architect / programmer or any other tech role .
Who do you think I 'm giving this talk to ?
It 's almost exclusively software engineers , not marketers .
Most of my talks are at the geekiest forums ...
OSCON , the European GNOME Conference , Linux Australia , etc. -- all loaded with almost nothing BUT programmers .
In fact , if they all knew this stuff , they would n't need to hear it .
Fortunately , a lot more software folks ( especially in open source ) are recognizing they could always use more help in things like usability , user experience , user learning , marketing , etc .
Darrell : I take your point , but I do n't think it really applies here .
I did n't make a personal attack ( although it * was * gratuitous , I agree ) .
I did n't slam ( or say ) Bill Gates was doing something wrong , but rather that Jeff Bezos did something surprisingly right ( in my opinion ) , given his position .
So , do I have an attitude that says Bill Gates would n't be interested in the details of topics like this ?
Yes .
Is that a personal attack ?
Not really .
The comparison was meant to highlight how Jeff Bezos is doing something you usually would n't find in someone that far from a start - up .
Oh what the hell ... who am I trying to kid ... I LOVE to make fun of Microsoft and Bill Gates : )
Even though I have deep respect and affection for quite a few heroic and creative people who work there .

Kathy , I thought I 'd have a hard time figuring out which CEO asked the question ... that is , until I saw the statement " He quit fondling his Blackberry . "

There 's no way Bill Gates has a Blackberry ; he undoubtedly has a Microsoft ( tm ) Smartphone ( tm ) , but not a Blackberry ...( tm ) 's added for emphasis , not for any legal reason .

I used to work at Amazon , key word ' used to ' .
Amazon is a great company to be a customer with , but not a great company to work for .
I just had to throw this warning in - the idea that being focused on the user , means that this guy would be great to work for or with .
So , what does it mean when Bezos pays attention to customer issues in depth , but when he was told of a high rate of regrettable attrition , did nothing ?
What does that kind of inconsistency mean ?
For me , it meant working for a new company , one that appreciates it 's employees , through and through .
Posted by : ryan | Feb 3 , 2007 7:10:00 PM
Jeff came to my talk at Amazon as well .
He 's brilliant , consistent and committed .
I think his biggest challenge : most of his people spend much too much time asking , " What would Jeff do ? "

Even if you do it because you believe it matters , you might get more traction if you charged money for your expertise .
Many companies , especially big companies , pay more attention to advice they have to pay for than to advice they can get for free .
You could have a sliding scale based on corporate revenue , from $ 0 for brand - new start - ups , up to some cap that 's big enough to show up on someone 's department budget , but not so huge that you feel dirty .

I love Amazon .
The books tend to arrive on schedule or early .
The only time I had a problem they apologized and resolved my complaint .
I can't imagine my managers every attending a talk on user satisfaction although we were all forced to attend a 2 day presentation on customer satisfaction .

Matt over at IGN has confirmed that the upcoming Mario Kart Wii will not support voice chat , but will instead be text - only .
Nintendo of Europe also explained that players will only be able use this feature before races , not during them .
" You can create rooms for friends to join and even text chat while you 're waiting for other racers , " NOE said .
With all of the new ( for the Wii anyways ) features that Mario Kart Wii is bringing to Nintendo 's console , the lack of voice support is a bit disappointing .
Even if you are n't a fan of being called racially insensitive names by complete strangers , it is always nice to have the option .
Hopefully , the game will also feature USB keyboard support to make the text chatting a little more bearable .
You will be able to get your chat on soon , as Mario Kart Wii is set to hit store shelves this April .
I know that GW Bush says all kinds of strange stuff , but is this the strangest ( I do n't mean most mendacious , that 's different ) remark of his current term in office ?
Bush said sympathetic to Tillman family .
President Bush hopes someone is held responsible for the U.S. military 's mishandling of information about the death of former football star Pat Tillman in Afghanistan , the White House said Wednesday .
That sound you hear is brains leaking out all over America .
See , the Tillman case involves many high - ranking people in the Army — Colonels and Generals and perhaps even high - ranking civilian officials — engaged in a knowing and willful conspiracy to cover up and then lie to the public about the circumstances of Pat Tillman 's death .
There is a chain of command here , and someone is a the top of it , either someone in a uniform or someone in a Pentagon .
And either way , they report to one GW Bush .
So if this GW Bush who so vaguely and generally “ hopes ” that “ someone ” is held responsible also hopes that the “ someone ” held responsible is the person who is in fact responsible , all that GW Bush would have to do is pick up the phone and make one — one ! — phone call to the current Secretary of Defense , asking for the appropriate head on a plate .
To read this statement from the White House is to be left with the belief that either
GW Bush does n't understand that he can give the Pentagon orders
GW Bush thinks we do n't understand he is the titular and ( should he choose to exercise the role ) actual head of government in this country as well as the Commander - in - Chief
GW Bush hopes very much that someone is scapegoated for the ongoing Tillman PR disaster , but does n't want to pick up the phone and order that the actual ringleader who ordered up this unnecessary and destructive piece of propaganda be unmasked because the truth ( Rumsfeld ?
Cheney ? ) is too embarrassing .
The words “ someone ” and “ responsible ” should not be used in the same paragraph as “ GW Bush ” .
Revolution #118 , February 3 , 2008
Andrew Sullivan on Obama : The “ Best Face ” For Imperialism
In an article in the December issue of The Atlantic , commentator Andrew Sullivan argues that Barack Obama should be the next president of the United States .
( “ Goodbye to All That : Why Obama Matters , ” December 2007 ) .
Sullivan writes that a ( ruling class ) “ consensus ” agenda for endless war and increased repression will be in effect regardless of who is president .
He challenges the reader to pick who could best implement all this in the face of global isolation and profound domestic alienation .
And , in the process , he sheds light on the real role of elections in this society .
Those who are willing to listen in on a ruling class insider ’s case for Obama , read on .
Civics 101 : Your Vote for President “ Has Little to Do With ” Basic Policy Decisions
First , a note on Andrew Sullivan ’s credentials : Sullivan writes columns for the New York Times , Time magazine , and is a regular on the political talk shows .
He is a senior editor at The Atlantic magazine .
Sullivan ’s defining political legacy was his tenure as editor of The New Republic , where he counted among his big achievements the promotion of the book The Bell Curve , a completely ridiculous but highly influential pseudoscientific book that claimed that Black people are genetically inferior to whites .
The New Republic under his editorship played a key role in — in his words — “ helping to torpedo the Clinton administration ’s plans for universal health coverage . ”
A conservative who has differences with Christian fundamentalism ( Sullivan is openly gay ) , he invokes Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher as models .
And yes , he is supporting Barack Obama for president .
Very early in Sullivan ’s article , he invokes and reveals a little ruling class secret :
Your vote “ has little to do with ” basic policy decisions .
Listen to Sullivan : “ The logic behind the candidacy of Barack Obama , ” he writes , “ has little to do with his policy proposals , which are very close to his Democratic rivals ’ and which , with a few exceptions , exist firmly within the conventions of our politics . ”
Sullivan lists , rather extensively , how such “ conventions of our politics ” are set for the next president , regardless of who he is .
The war in Iraq ?
It “ has a momentum that will propel the occupation into the next decade . ”
“ Every potential president , ” writes Sullivan , “ is committed to an open - ended deployment in Afghanistan and an unbending alliance with Israel . ”
And Sullivan does n’t even pose as “ issues ” many of the most egregious outrages that people are angry about — from the abandonment of the poor and Black people of New Orleans , to the generated xenophobia and reign of terror against immigrants .
The word “ torture ” never appears in his article .
While Sullivan ’s actual projection of the ruling class “ evolving consensus ” is bad enough , it also includes what is likely wishful thinking on his part .
For example , he postulates that this “ consensus ” includes permitting abortion in the first trimester — something that the leading Republican candidates have vowed to end .
But the more fundamental revelation pointed to here is not that Obama ’s policies are the same as those of every other “ credible ” candidate ( which they are ) , but that it does n’t really matter what his policies are .
Underlying Sullivan ’s assertion that Obama ’s candidacy ( or anyone else ’s ) has “ little to do with his policy proposals ” is a deeper truth which is not acknowledged by Sullivan , although it drives the whole framework that he does acknowledge .
The foundational thing here is that whoever is elected president of the United States presides over a system of capitalism - imperialism that has its own logic , and any president who tried to go against that would be “ overruled ” in one form or another quickly by the system .
To take just one example :
If someone got elected president and tried to withdraw U.S. military forces from all of the 130 countries with U.S. bases , this plan would be “ overruled ” in one form or another by the apparatus of the capitalist state ( through “ advice ” from ruling class advisers , impeachment , “ scandal , ” or other forms ) .
Why ?
Because the global domination of U.S. capital is projected and enforced by these military bases .
That imperialist domination of the world , in turn , is key to the relative high standard of living and social stability within the U.S.
If a president tried to shut down all the U.S. military bases around the world , that would be incompatible with , and cause severe disruption in the U.S. imperialist economy and in society .
Having clarified that this election “ has little to do with [ Obama ’s ] policy proposals , ” and “ even less to do with his ideological pedigree , ” Sullivan gets to the argument for Obama , and in the course of doing so , entreats the reader into complicity with terrible crimes .
“ The Most Effective Re-Branding of the United States Since Reagan ”
Obama , argues Sullivan , is “ the most effective potential re-branding of the United States since Reagan .
Such a re-branding is not trivial — it ’s central to an effective war strategy .
The war on Islamist terror , after all , is two - pronged : a function of both hard power and soft power . ”
( By “ hard power , ” Sullivan means military force ; by “ soft power , ” he means non-military dimensions of “ winning hearts and minds ” — in conjunction with the use of , or threat of , military power . )
Choosing whether Obama , Clinton , Edwards , McCain or anyone else would actually be the most effective “ soft power ” weapon in the “ war on terror , ” is choosing who will put the best face on the actual source of the worst global terror — U.S. imperialism .
Let ’s check back into reality for a moment and reflect on the horrors the “ war on terror ” has brought :
Up to a million or more dead Iraqis .
Five million Iraqis dislocated from their homes or country .
Afghanistan , in ruins , controlled by either the Taliban or drug - growing Islamic fundamentalist warlords aligned with the U.S. Torture chambers from Bagram in Afghanistan to secret cells in Europe .
Rendition to Egypt , Syria , Saudi Arabia for more U.S. - sponsored torture .
Detention without trial .
Guantánamo .
And a world trapped in a horrific polarization between U.S. imperialist aggression , plunder , and terror , and reactionary Islamic fundamentalism that is both the target of and , in many ways , a product of the “ war on terror . ”
Obama ’s invocation of Ronald Reagan is worth another look in the context of Sullivan ’s article .
Sullivan specifically argues that Obama could be the most effective president at projecting U.S. power around the world since Reagan .
Reagan ’s infamous joke : “ My fellow Americans , I ’m pleased to tell you today that I ’ve signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever , we begin bombing in five minutes , ” concentrated his role in history .
While he rattled horrific nuclear weapons , he armed thugs to carry out terror from Nicaragua to Afghanistan , from El Salvador and Guatemala to Angola and Mozambique .
Reagan fostered a war between Iraq and Iran that took the lives of a million people and backed the apartheid government of South Africa and the racist state of Israel — when both were brutally suppressing internal rebellions of the oppressed peoples within their borders .
Since controversy broke out over his pro-Reagan statements to a Nevada newspaper , Obama has sought to “ clarify ” what he meant .
Let ’s re-examine his statements .
In the interview with the Reno Gazette - Journal , Obama said : “ Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not .
He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it .
I think they felt like with all the excesses of the ’60s and ’ 70s , and government had grown and grown , but there was n’t much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating .
I think he tapped into what people were already feeling .
Which is ,
‘ We want clarity , we want optimism , we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing . ’”
Later Obama “ clarified ” his remarks to say that he “ spent a lifetime fighting against Ronald Reagan ’s policies , ” while not recanting his previous comments .
But , as we have seen , “ policies ” are not really what elections are all about .
What Obama calls the “ excesses ” of the ’60s were really great struggles that did not go far enough .
And the point remains that both Sullivan , and Obama himself , are invoking the Reagan legacy in terms promoting feel - good “ clarity ” and “ optimism ” about the crimes of U.S. imperialism .
Nobody who opposes the terrible course this country is on should want to be part of a campaign to do that .
Two Scenarios
In promoting Obama for president , Sullivan poses a couple of very heavy scenarios .
Sullivan writes : “ Consider this hypothetical .
It ’s November 2008 .
A young Pakistani Muslim is watching television and sees that this man Barack Hussein Obama is the new face of America .
In one simple image , America ’s soft power has been ratcheted up not a notch , but a logarithm ...
If you wanted the crudest but most effective weapon against the demonization of America that fuels Islamist ideology , Obama ’s face gets close .
It proves them wrong about what America is in ways no words can . ”
This is an argument for who would be the best face on endless imperialist war , mass murder , and torture .
Why the hell would you want to be part of choosing who could best put that over on people ?
And Sullivan argues that Obama is not only a better face for the “ war on terror ” around the world , but also a uniquely credible face for domestic repression .
What would happen , Sullivan asks , if there were “ another 9/11 – style attack . ”
He poses that “ It is hard to imagine a reprise of the sudden unity and solidarity in the days after 9/11 , or an outpouring of support from allies and neighbors .
It is far easier to imagine an even more bitter fight over who was responsible ( apart from the perpetrators ) and a profound suspicion of a government forced to impose more restrictions on travel , communications , and civil liberties .
The current president would be unable to command the trust , let alone the support , of half the country in such a time .
He could even be blamed for provoking any attack that came . ”
The context here is an argument over who would be best , in the event of “ another 9/11 - style attack ” ( or , one could add , a claim by the government that one was “ planned ” ) , to implement what Sullivan euphemistically calls “ more restrictions on travel , communications , civil liberties . ”
Right now , uncounted people are on secret “ watch lists , ” prohibited from traveling on airplanes .
The most massively intrusive surveillance in human history monitors your phone calls and your Internet browsing , and makes it illegal for a librarian to tell you the government is looking at what books you check out .
The president can lock up anyone , for any reason , on his say - so , without recourse to anything resembling a credible trial .
And Sullivan is arguing that Obama would be best for implementing even more fascistic repression .
Once more :
Why the hell would you want to be part of choosing who could best put that over on people ?
The Intensifying Domestic “ Civil War ”
Sullivan frames his argument for Obama in the context of what he calls an “ intensifying , a nonviolent civil war . ”
A conflict “ about culture and about religion and about race . ”
There is profound conflict in the U.S. over culture , religion , and race .
It is characterized not by nonviolence , but by one - sided violence .
White supremacy that in an earlier era was enforced through lynch mobs and nooses ( and note the comeback of the noose ) is today enforced in the inner cities by the policeman ’s gun .
The religious culture war is waged by violent attacks on not only abortion clinics , but also those who work for them .
And society is so permeated with violence against women in the form of rape and domestic violence against women that it is an invisible part of the “ culture . ”
There is also a polarization at the top of society , among the ruling class .
On one side , the core around Bush ( and , generally speaking , ruling class forces whose agenda is expressed by or represented by the Republican Party ) is on a mission — in the literal , religious sense in many ways — to radically remake the post - “ Cold War ” world and to tear up the “ social contract ” that has more or less held U.S. society together for generations .
On the other side are forces in the ruling class who are operating in the same framework , but fear doing all this too fast , too overtly , and in a way that will tear society apart ( generally characterized by the leaders of the Democratic Party ) .
A substantial thread in Sullivan ’s article includes his advice on how to manage the conflict at the top of the ruling class , including his dissatisfaction with Bush ’s style and approach ( among Sullivan ’s complaints : Bush is “ unable to do nuance ” ) .
But here , we ’ll focus on Sullivan ’s argument that Obama is the best face not only for U.S. imperialist war , but also for resolving the domestic “ civil war . ”
Obama , Sullivan writes , can take “ America — finally — past the debilitating , self - perpetuating family quarrel of the Baby Boom generation that has long engulfed all of us . ”
And Obama can end “ the war within America that has prevailed since Vietnam and that shows dangerous signs of intensifying . ”
Sullivan ’s own perspective is that the best course for those with fears and reservations about the direction things are heading is to adopt much of the framework established by Bush , and push for moderation within that .
Sullivan sees the Baby Boomers ( his repeated term for the legacy of the ’ 60s ) as an obstacle to forging a reasonable course within the “ evolving consensus . ”
In his article , he claims that those who oppose the U.S. “ war on terror , ” and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , “ judged the 9/11 attacks to be a legitimate response to decades of U.S. foreign policy . ”
This distortion is important to excavate .
The most powerful opposition voices to the “ war on terror ” have never argued that 9/11 was a “ legitimate response ” to U.S. foreign policy .
They have argued that the “ war on terror ” is immoral , illegal , and illegitimate ; and that the people themselves must forge a new way forward in opposition to both McWorld and Jihad .
For example , the Call from World Ca n’t Wait , signed by thousands of people including many prominent actors , authors , political activists , and others , begins : “ YOUR GOVERNMENT , on the basis of outrageous lies , is waging a murderous and utterly illegitimate war in Iraq , with other countries in their sights .
YOUR GOVERNMENT is openly torturing people , and justifying it . ”
( The Call is available at worldcantwait.org . )
Millions in this country have asked , and more should ask , “ Why do they hate us so much ? ”
Distorting such questioning and opposition in the way Sullivan does — claiming that such opposition judges the 9/11 attacks “ legitimate ” — fits in with the framework established by the Bush mantra of “ You ’re either with us or you ’re with the terrorists . ”
Sullivan , and let ’s face it , he is accurately projecting what Obama is about , argues that Obama can isolate “ the Baby Boomers ” and get America past all that ’60s stuff .
And here again , the Reagan legacy is invoked , not — actually — by Sullivan , but by Obama himself who recently pointed to Reagan ’s ability to “ transform how we think about ourselves as a country in fundamental ways … ”
As we wrote last week , in the wake of the rebellious culture of the ’60s , “ Reagan came out there with this shit - eating grin and salesman ’s chuckle , and all the while he mobilized a fascist social base ready to bully anybody , and he narcotized those in the middle , and he effectively silenced and marginalized those who stood for anything decent . ”
( See “ ‘ American Greatness ’ — And Why Obama and Reagan Really DO Belong Together , ” by Toby O’Ryan at revcom.us . )
In this context , Obama ’s constant invocation that “ There is no liberal America , there is no conservative America , there is only the United States of America … ” can be understood as a call for patriotic national unity — unity with the most terrible crimes being committed by the world ’s sole superpower .
And again , it must be posed :
Who the hell would want to “ resolve ” the culture wars in society this way ?
Sullivan does not focus much in this essay on the great societal divide over the oppression of Black people ( or other oppressed nationalities ) .
( The relationship between Obama ’s campaign and white supremacy is beyond the scope of this article , but here it can be noted that in this essay Sullivan describes “ Obama ’s campaign for white America : courteous and smiling and with no sudden moves . ” )
Sullivan does address the question of the rise of theocratic Christian religious fundamentalism .
In the method typical of his article , Sullivan defines the societal divide over religion in terms that marginalize secularism , and even separation of church and state , referring to a conflict between “ God- fearing Americans and the peacenik atheist hippies . ”
Sullivan argues for a bigger role for religion in society and government than has been the norm up to Bush .
The choice , Sullivan poses , is between “ crude exploitation of sectarian loyalty and religious zeal by Bush and Rove , ” and a bigger role for religion that stops short of that .
Sullivan writes , “ You cannot lead the United States without having a foot in both the religious and secular camps . ”
Whatever Sullivan ’s intentions , the view of ceding a larger role to religion and denigrating secular culture ( those “ atheist hippies ” ) cedes the moral high ground to Christian fascists .
Both Obama and Hillary Clinton ( and before her Bill Clinton ) have also promoted the illusion that by conceding ground to the Christian fundamentalists you can moderate or temper them .
It is in this context that Obama ’s particular brand of professed Christian beliefs fits the bill , according to Sullivan , although he acknowledges that Hillary Clinton as well is taking pains to position herself as accommodating to the rise of Christian fundamentalism .
What We REALLY Need
Underlying Sullivan ’s argument that Obama is the best candidate to manage all these conflicts in the direction the ruling class wants to take things is an explicit acknowledgement that there is a sharp polarization in U.S. society that could get out of control — “ the war within America that has prevailed since Vietnam and that shows dangerous signs of intensifying . ”
This intensifying situation will not just “ fall into ” anything good for the people .
The global anger at the U.S. is far from enough to bring about anything positive .
That is the case within the U.S. , and it is the case worldwide .
Within the U.S. , anger at the direction of things can take , and for many is taking , the form of rallying around patriotic Christian fascism and an attraction to the “ good old days ” of unquestioned white supremacy and “ good vs. evil ” simplistic support for U.S. wars .
Around the world , far too many angry oppressed people look to the reactionary dead end of Islamic fundamentalism as a “ response ” to imperialism .
But the emergence of a real and visible opposition to the whole direction this country is headed , standing with and starting from the interests of humanity , can forge a new polarization within the U.S. and create a much better climate for the emergence of progressive and revolutionary movements worldwide , and can even create openings for , and forces for , revolutionary change in the U.S .
Working for that is something worth doing .
And it is a lot more realistic than putting your faith in a candidacy , and a process that is part of putting “ the best face ” on a world of horrors !
“ If you fall into the orientation of trying to make the Democrats be what they are not , and never will be , you will end up becoming more like what the Democrats actually are . ”

Women cannot make even simple decisions on children , the report says Saudi women are being kept in perpetual childhood so male relatives can exercise " guardianship " over them , the Human Rights Watch group has said .
The New York - based group says Saudi women have to obtain permission from male relatives to work , travel , study , marry or even receive health care .
Their access to justice is also severely constrained , it says .
The group says the Saudi establishment sacrifices basic human rights to maintain male control over women .
Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where women are not allowed to drive .
Saudi clerics see the guardianship of women 's honour as a key to the country 's social and moral order .
' No progress '
The report , Perpetual Minors : Human Rights Abuses Stemming from Male Guardianship and Sex Segregation in Saudi Arabia , draws on more than 100 interviews with Saudi women .
Farida Deif , women 's rights researcher for the Middle East at Human Rights Watch , said : " Saudi women wo n't make any progress until the government ends the abuses that stem from these misguided policies . "
It 's astonishing that the Saudi government denies adult women the right to make decisions for themselves but holds them criminally responsible for their actions at puberty
Farida Deif ,
Human Rights Watch
Read the full HRW report
The report says that Saudi women are denied the legal right to make even trivial decisions for their children - women cannot open bank accounts for children , enrol them in school , obtain school files or travel with their children without written permission from the child 's father .
Human Rights
Watch says that Saudi women are prevented from accessing government agencies that have no established female sections unless they have a male representative .
The need to establish separate office spaces for women is a disincentive to hiring female employees , and female students are often relegated to unequal facilities with unequal academic opportunities , the report says .
Male guardianship over adult women also contributes to their risk of exposure to violence within the family as victims of violence find it difficult to seek protection or redress from the courts .
Social workers , physicians and lawyers say that it is nearly impossible to remove guardianship from male guardians who are abusive , the group says .
" It 's astonishing that the Saudi government denies adult women the right to make decisions for themselves but holds them criminally responsible for their actions at puberty , " said Ms Deif .
" For Saudi women , reaching adulthood brings no rights , only responsibilities . "

What are these ?
While recent attempts to create a perpetual motion machine somehow inexplicably did n't pan out , a physics professor from Osaka University now claims to have made a scientific breakthrough of another sort , with him now touting nothing less than a supposedly successful demonstration of cold fusion .
That was apparently done by forcing deuterium gas under pressure into an evacuated cell containing a sample of palladium dispersed in zirconium oxide , which caused the deuterium to be absorbed by the palladium sample , resulting in a denser , or " pynco " deuterium , with deuterium nuclei that are close enough together to fuse .
That process also supposedly resulted in a rise in temperature to about 70° Celsius , and a temperature in the center of the cell that remained " significantly warmer " than the cell wall for 50 hours after the test .
Of course , there does n't appear to be any other scientists ready to back up the experiment just yet , so you 'll have to rely on your own armchair science expertise to get your hopes up or down accordingly on this one .

Study : Incarceration rate lower for immigrants
Immigrants in California are far less likely to land in prison than their U.S. - born counterparts , a finding that defies the perception that immigration and crime are connected , according to a study released Monday .
Foreign - born residents make up 35 percent of the state 's overall population , but only 17 percent of the adult prison population , according to the Public Policy Institute of California , which conducted the research .
Noncitizen men from Mexico between the ages of 18 and 40 , which the study indicated were more likely to be in the country illegally , were eight times less likely to be in a " correctional setting , " the study found .
The study did not address the visa status of those included among the foreign - born , which would include citizens and noncitizens , including those in the country legally and illegally .
Nonetheless , these results have implications for the current debates over immigration policy , said Kristin Butcher , co-author of the report .
" Our research indicates that limiting immigration , requiring higher educational levels to obtain visas or spending more money to increase penalties against criminal immigrants will have little impact on public safety , " Butcher said in a statement .
While immigrants often have lower levels of education and higher poverty rates , which are normally associated with higher crimes rates , other factors are probably contributing to the underrepresentation among the foreign - born in state prisons .
Current immigration laws , for example , screen legal immigrants for criminal activity .
Also , all noncitizens - including those in the country legally - face deportation for crimes that carry a prison sentence of a year or more .
And those here illegally have incentive to avoid contact with the law , which could lead to detection of their immigration status .
The study acknowledged several factors that could affect the incarceration rates among foreign - and U.S. - born residents , including the possibility that one group might receive more lenient treatment within the criminal justice system or have greater resources to mount a defense .
Also , the deportation of foreign - born criminals also could affect the rates , the study said .

Vicki Iseman in middle of McCain lobbyist scandal Lobbyist Vicki Iseman is caught up in a scandal involving Republican presidential candidate John McCain .
Both John McCain and Vicki Iseman deny they ever had a romantic relationship .
From the NY Times : Early in Senator John McCain 's first run for the White House eight years ago , waves of anxiety swept through his small circle of advisers .
A female lobbyist had been turning up with him at fund - raisers , in his offices and aboard a client 's corporate jet .
Convinced the relationship had become romantic , some of his top advisers intervened to protect the candidate from himself - instructing staff members to block the woman 's access , privately warning her away and repeatedly confronting him , several people involved in the campaign said on the condition of anonymity .
When news organizations reported that Mr. McCain had written letters to government regulators on behalf of the lobbyist 's clients , the former campaign associates said , some aides feared for a time that attention would fall on her involvement .
Mr. McCain , 71 , and the lobbyist , Vicki Iseman , 40 , both say they never had a romantic relationship .
But to his advisers , even the appearance of a close bond with a lobbyist whose clients often had business before the Senate committee Mr. McCain led threatened the story of redemption and rectitude that defined his political identity .
A decade ago a McCain 's political career nearly ended in the Keating Five scandal .
Since then he has claimed to be a crusader for stricter ethics and campaign finance rules .
UPDATE : " It is a shame that TheNew York Times has lowered its standards to engage in a hit - and - run smear campaign , " McCain 's communications director , Jill Hazelbaker , said .
" John McCain has a 24 - year record of serving our country with honor and integrity .
He has never violated the public trust . "

Related Stories Bush gives McCain the kiss of death McCain says Clinton would make a good president
The battle for Basra , which came to a halt on Sunday , was a disaster for everyone except its intended losers .
Tens of thousands of families were trapped in their homes for a week , their electricity , mobile phones and water cut off .
The number of deaths is unknown , but is probably several hundred .
Iraq 's prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki - who ordered the assault and put his prestige on the line by supervising it in person - has emerged with his authority severely weakened .
His army and police took a battering and failed to capture any ground , with several commanders and units going over to the Sadrist militias they were meant to be defeating .
And the Bush administration 's effort to portray Iraq as a place that is gradually calming down thanks to the " surge " of an extra 30,000 US troops looks far less convincing to an increasingly sceptical US public .
Finally , there is the blow to Britain 's remaining forces stuck at Basra airport .
Some 1,600 had been hoping to leave Iraq this spring .
Des Browne 's Commons statement this week shows that a few of them played a bigger role in the Basra fighting than was at first realised .
As well as mounting surveillance and artillery strikes , British troops were deployed to rescue Iraqi units from militia counterattacks .
Now the government feels it has to show solidarity with Maliki and Bush by delaying another troop reduction , even though only a limited number were needed last week .
British forces are held hostage to save the face of politicians once again .
Meanwhile , Moqtada al - Sadr , the target of the assault , comes out of the crisis strengthened .
His militiamen gave no ground and , by declaring a ceasefire that has successfully held since Sunday , Sadr has demonstrated his authority and the discipline of his men .
Their tactics are often brutal and some of his commanders little more than thugs or warlords , but they obey their political boss .
Big questions remain over the backroom negotiations that ended the fighting .
In his ceasefire announcement Sadr called for an end to the Maliki government 's campaign of arresting local Sadr representatives in Baghdad and other cities .
This has been going on for months without a Sadr response .
Sadr also asked for the release of those being held , an estimated two thousand .
What is not clear is whether the government conceded these points during pre-ceasefire talks .
If so , then Sadr 's appeal was a generous cover to allow the government not to look as though it had already capitulated .
Much will depend on whether Maliki fulfils the promises he made .
Otherwise fighting may resume , this time with Sadr taking the initiative .
The US role is the other main unknown .
General David Petraeus , the US commander in Iraq , and the Bush administration 's civilian officials supported the arrests of Sadr 's people .
They have long worked with Maliki and Sadr 's main political rivals , the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq ( formerly the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq ) , to weaken the movement .
Although the fighting in Basra was led by the Iraqi national army , many of its units are made up of troops of Isci 's fighting wing , the Badr organisation .
President Bush described last week 's fighting as a " positive moment in the development of a sovereign nation that is willing to take on elements that believe they are beyond the law " .
In reality , it amounted to US support for the promotion of a Shia civil war .
There are depressing similarities with US policy in Palestine , where the US is arming and financing Mahmoud Abbas 's Fatah movement against Hamas instead of working for Palestinian unity .
US officials say that Iran is behind the Sadr movement , a charge that could equally be made about Isci , whose leaders spent decades exiled in Tehran during the Saddam Hussein years .
In fact , Sadr 's real sin in Washington 's eyes is that , of all the Shia movements , his is the one that has most consistently opposed the US occupation and called for a timetable for US troops to leave Iraq .
How far was the US responsible for last week 's assault ?
When Iraqi government forces became bogged down after the initial attacks , US officials were quick to brief American journalists that they had not been fully consulted in advance .
Certainly the government 's poor performance and the flare - up in fighting have made things harder for Petraeus and the US ambassador , Ryan Crocker , when they brief Congress next week on the latest results of the surge .
But it is hard to believe that the Iraqi army could have undertaken such a major offensive without American cooperation , since they needed American , and British , surveillance and air support .
The most likely explanation is that the Americans approved the assault , confidently expecting it would succeed within a few days .
The hardline US vice - president , Dick Cheney , was in Baghdad two weeks earlier and may well have urged Maliki to go ahead .
They hoped for a triumph to boast about in Congress .
Now they must explain a disaster .
Even before the Basra assault , scepticism about the surge was mounting in the US .
A majority of the American public wants a timetable for a US withdrawal , and the two Democratic contenders are still firm on the point , arguing that the surge has not resolved Iraq 's underlying problems .
Senators Obama and Clinton are vague on some key issues , not least their intention to keep " residual forces " in or around Iraq even if most combat troops leave .
But they have not been taken in by the surge .
Deploying an extra 30,000 troops was not the main factor in lessening sectarian attacks - the measure used to define the surge 's success .
More significant was the uprising by Iraqi Sunnis against al - Qaida , which has put foreign jihadis on the defensive and made it harder for them to attack Shias .
The ceasefire announced by Sadr last August had a major effect in reducing revenge attacks by his followers on Sunni civilians .
That is why last week 's assault on Basra was particularly foolish .
Instead of using Sadr 's original ceasefire constructively to engage him in political dialogue , American officials joined Maliki in trying to break Sadr 's movement .
The lesson of the past few days must be that this policy is doomed .
Sadr is a major player who can not be marginalised or defeated .
He has widespread popular support , not just because of his socially conservative Islamist message , but because of his nationalist credentials .
These have been strengthened by last week 's failed assault .
It should not be repeated .

To the Editor :
As a former mortgage banker in Baltimore , I feel for the women described in “ Baltimore Finds Subprime Crisis Snags Women ” ( front page , Jan. 15 ) .
The subprime mortgage mess came about for many reasons .
But a big part is missing from the media coverage , and it ’s exactly the reason people took out subprime loans  they had bad credit and posed a big risk to the lenders .
Bad credit means missed payments on cars , 30 - 60 - 90 - day late payments on credit cards , bankruptcies and so on .
While I know that these are things that should not have been overlooked by the lenders , and led to many of today ’s crises , for the most part these people put themselves in a position in which the subprime loan was their only option .
An AP - Yahoo poll conducted April 2 - 14 found that “ about 8 percent of whites would be uncomfortable voting for a black for president . ”
A measure of racism : 15 percent ?
I was talking the other day to a prominent Republican who asked me what I thought John McCain ’s strongest issues would be in the general election .
Lower taxes and the argument he will be better able to protect America from its enemies , I said .

Republicans have a pretty good track record with those two .
The Republican shook his head .
“ You ’re missing the most important one , ” he said .
“ Race .
McCain runs against Barack Obama and the race vote is worth maybe 15 percent to McCain . ”
The man I was talking to is not a racist ; he was just stating what he believes to be a fact :
There is a percentage of the American electorate who will simply not vote for a black person no matter what his qualities or qualifications .
How big is that percentage ?
An AP - Yahoo poll conducted April 2 - 14 found that “ about 8 percent of whites would be uncomfortable voting for a black for president . ”
I do n’t know if 8 percent sounds high or low to you , but I was amazed that 8 percent of respondents were willing to admit this to a pollster .
And I figure that the true figure is much higher .
The same poll , by the way , found that 15 percent of voters think Obama is a Muslim .
He is , in fact , a Christian .
But thinking a person is a Muslim probably does not encourage you to vote for him in America today .
And consider this little nugget from Monday ’s Washington Post , in a story by Kevin Merida and Jose Antonio Vargas datelined Scranton , Pa. :
“ Barack Obama ’s campaign opened a downtown office here on March 15 , just in time for the annual St. Patrick ’s Day parade .
It was not a glorious day for Team Obama .
Some of the green signs the campaign had trucked in by the thousands were burned during the parade , and campaign volunteers — white volunteers — were greeted with racial slurs . ”
Signs burned ?
Racial slurs shouted out loud ?
In this day and age ?
Maybe that 15 percent estimate is low .
I am not suggesting for a second that McCain would exploit race in a campaign against Obama .
He would not .
But the real question is whether the racial issue has to be “ exploited ” at all .
It is pretty powerful just sitting there on its own .
Ronald Reagan began his presidential campaign in 1980 by giving a speech at a county fair in Philadelphia , Miss. , where three civil rights workers — James Chaney , Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman — had been murdered in 1964 .
Reagan made no mention of the murders or civil rights in that speech but did say , “ I believe in states ’ rights . ” “ States ’ rights ” was common code in those days for letting states discriminate against black people .
A few months ago , David Brooks , a conservative columnist for The New York Times , defended Reagan , claiming it is a “ distortion ” to say Reagan opened his campaign “ with an appeal to racism . ”
But Brooks also wrote : “ Reagan could have done something wonderful if he ’d mentioned civil rights at the fair .
He did n’t .
And it ’s obviously true that race played a role in the GOP ’s ascent . ”
In 2005 , then - Republican Party chairman Ken Mehlman gave a speech to a National Association for the Advancement of Colored People convention in Milwaukee denouncing the use of race as a wedge issue .
“ Some Republicans gave up on winning the African - American vote , looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization , ” Mehlman said .
“ I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong . ”
On Monday , McCain went to Selma , Ala. , where on March 7 , 1965 , more than 500 civil rights marchers were beaten and clubbed by state troopers at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as the rest of America watched on television .
“ They watched and were ashamed of their country , ” McCain said .
“ And they knew that the people who had tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge were n’t a mob ; they were n’t a threat ; they were n’t revolutionaries .
They were people who believed in America — in the promise of America .
And they believed in a better America .
They were patriots — the best kind of patriots . ”
The Associated Press noted that McCain drew a crowd Monday of about 100 people that “ was mostly white , although , as the campaign noted , Selma ’s population is 70 percent black . ”
“ I am aware the African - American vote has been very small in favor of the Republican Party ; I am aware of the challenges , and I am aware of the fact that there will be many people who will not vote for me , ” McCain said .
“ But I ’m going to be the president of all the people . ”
Which was an intriguing point :
Sure , there are voters who will not vote for Obama under any circumstances , but McCain was saying there are also voters who will not vote for him under any circumstances .
But which group , if either one , will hold the balance of power in November ?
MUSIC legend Morrissey has given a gift of £ 20,000 to the youth club he made internationally famous .
Salford Lads Club became a mecca for devoted fans of the singer , who fronted cult Manchester band The Smiths , when it featured in the artwork for their 1986 album The Queen is Dead .
Volunteers this year launched a £ 1 million campaign to restore and upgrade the grade II listed Edwardian building .
But they suffered a massive setback when thieves climbed scaffolding to steal guttering and lead from the roof in July .
Now Davyhulme - born Morrissey has given the fundraising team a surprise reason to celebrate .
Project manager Leslie Holmes said : " Fans travel from all over the world to visit Salford Lads Club .
I think they will be as delighted as we are by Morrissey ’s support .
I imagine it is their dedication that made him aware of our cause and I hope his contribution will now alert others to it .
“ It is an unexpected and wonderful gesture , particularly coming from a Manchester lad – it does a great deal for relations between the two cities . ”
Although the singer was never a member of the club , a room inside was dedicated to The Smiths in 2004 – its centenary year – for the international attention brought by the iconic black and white photo used for the album , which is now in part of the collection at London ’s National Portrait Gallery .
200 members
The red - brick club , in St Ignatius Walk , Ordsall , is used by around 200 members and is one of the few original lads ’ clubs still standing in England .
It remains virtually unchanged from its heyday with original fittings including a boxing ring , snooker rooms and a brick - walled gym with a viewing balcony .
The club is now open to girls and boys .
It falls within a regeneration area and developers LPC Living helped raise the first £ 250,000 for crucial roofing work .
But July ’s vandalism left the restoration fund short of the same amount after it was used to pay a security firm had to be paid to monitor the site .
Morrissey ’s donation pushes the fund back up to the £ 330,000 mark and will be used to put insulation into the roof and carry out work on the ceiling .
Club secretary Brian Ball added : “ Morrissey and The Smiths made a big difference to the Salford Lads ’ club by having their picture taken outside in 1986 .
" They were never members of the club and did n’t even come from Salford , so it ’s a marvellous gesture by Morrissey to give support to the future of our club . ”
Morrissey ’s manager , Merck Mercuriadis , said of the donation : “ The donation is a reflection of how important the Salford Lad ’s Club and its future is to Morrissey .
This was meant to be a private gesture but we have agreed to allow it to be made public at the request of the club directors as they felt very strongly that it would encourage further contributions and guarantee the success of the campaign and the club ’s survival . ”
The fund benefited from another cash boost when property tycoon Chek Whyte gave money to the roof project after working undercover in the city as part of Channel 4 ’s Secret Millionaire programme .

Testing out the above changes , I am immediately redirected to a page saying " Sorry , all the Sandboxes are full . "
Let me restate that :
From the time I pushed those changes live to the time I could test them out , 160 people had beaten me into the sandboxes .
Wow .
3/12/2008 10:00 am : 700 signups / hr , 500 hits / sec , 5 - 20 % CPU
Looking through the error logs , I 'm starting to see our first concurrency issues .
These are the little one - in - a - million things that you 'd never find in test , but that happen every ten minutes under load .
They 're mostly low - hanging fruit , so I spend the next hour patching and re-deploying until the error logs go silent .
3/12/2008 12:00 pm : 600 signups / hr , 400 hits / sec , 5 - 17 % CPU
I 'd been doing all of this from my sister 's house up in Ft. Worth , who I had supposedly been visiting for a couple days , but whose house I had been mostly using for an office ( thanks Lisa for tolerating that , and I promise to get out and visit sometime when I 'm not trying to launch a new website ! )
Now I had to hop in the car and drive back to Austin to fly home .
Our trusty server will be on its own for the next 12 hours , taking the beating of its life .
I wo n't even know if it goes down .
3/13/2008 4000 signups / day , 100 hits /sec , 3-10 % CPU
Twiddla Art Back in a stable place , and ready to deal with the flood of feedback emails we 've been getting .
This part is fun , since most people have nice things to say , and it becomes readily apparent what features everybody wants to see .
Nothing has broken , so I actually have some time to put a few minor features live .
The " Wite - out " button was added this day , I think , and I re-did the way we handle snapshots and image exporting .
3/14/2008 3000 signups / day , 100 hits / sec , 2-5 % CPU
I implemented a fix for the last little concurrency bug that we'd been seeing .
Then , while profiling that fix on the server , I noticed that TwiddleBot was flipping out .
TwiddleBot is the little service that runs the Guided Tour feature , and is also responsible for clearing out the sandboxes from time to time .
Turns out , he was also pounding the database 20 times a second , asking for instructions .
Hmm … Chill , TwiddleBot .
Pushed a fix for that , and suddenly CPU usage dropped to zero .
Like , ZERO !
Every 5 seconds , it would spike up to 1 % .
Cool .
I think we 're gonna be able to scale this thing …
One week later , ~1000 signups per day , 50 hits / sec , 0 % CPU
In the end , we came through our first little scaling event rather well .
We were actually a bit over - prepared .
Our colocation facility ( Easystreet in Beaverton , Oregon ) had a couple extra boxes waiting to go for us , and I had taken the time a week earlier to write up and test a little software load balancer to allocate whiteboard sessions to various boxes when needed .
In the end , we did n't get to try any of that out .
Hell , we never spiked the processor on our one server over 50 % .
I 'd love to congratulate myself for the design choices I made all those months back when I wrote that article , but I think it 's still too early in the game to conclude that we 'll really scale when we ramp up to the next level .
Still , it 's worth noting that everything in Twiddla was built using the simple , Readable , Debuggable backend that we 've been using on our more pedestrian sites for years , and it held up just fine under traffic .
When it turned out that parts of that backend needed refactoring to handle the kind of concurrency we saw last week , it was a simple 5 minute task to crack open the code , find what needed to change , and change it .
Readable , Debuggable , Maintainable .
That 's the plan .
Thus far , that has enabled us to keep on top of any Performance and Scalability issues that have come along .
With luck , things will continue to work that way !
This article was originally published in 2009 and has been updated .
By now most of us have heard the statistics .
If we do n’t limit our planet ’s warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels , we will set in motion cataclysmic change that will result in lost ecosystems and irreversible damage to our planet .
Some of these changes are already occurring .
The last 40 years have seen the warmest surface temperatures in recorded history .
The past several years have been among the warmest on record .
Spring of 2019 set a record for the highest amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 800,000 years .
Scientists have concluded that human activity , primarily the burning of fossil fuels , is the major driving factor in climate change .
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , “ Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere by photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years ; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years . ”
I mentioned the $ 30 million Google Lunar X - Prize a few months ago , but now there ’s a bit of an update : the first team has stepped forward and announced that they ’ll be trying to claim it .
The team is called Odyssey Moon , and it stars International Space University founder Bob Richards and Inmarsat CFO Ramin Khadem .
If all goes well , they ’ll land a rover on the Moon within the next 7 years .
Just a quick recap .
The Google Lunar X - Prize follows on the success of the original Ansari X - Prize .
The first private group that can land a rover on the surface of the Moon , and complete a series of challenges before December 31st , 2014 will win $ 30 million .
Team organizers have said that hundreds of teams have expressed an interest , but nobody has actually filled out the necessary paperwork … until today .
Team Odyssey Moon announced their intention to compete for the Google Lunar X - Prize at the Space Investment Summit in San Jose , California .
The team will be based on the Isle of Man , off the coast of England .
Not a place known for its bustling space commerce , but the team founders say the location has the right business regulations and tax laws for such an unusual business venture .
And that ’s the point , they expect this to be a business venture .
Richards and Khadem believe they have a viable business plan for operating a Moon rover business .
They ’ll finance operations by the delivery of science , exploration and commercial payloads to the surface of the Moon .
According to the Odyssey Moon folks , the $ 30 million prize is just a nice benefit .
For my fellow Canadians , you ’ll be please to hear that MacDonald , Dettwiler and Associates has been selected as the mission ’s prime contractor .
MDA has developed the robotic arms used on the space shuttle and International Space Station , and hardware for other space missions .
In addition to the two founders , the Planetary Society announced today that they ’re going to pitch in with Odyssey Moon , helping out with education , public involvement , and serving as a science liaison for the project .
Although Odyssey Moon is just the first team to announce their intentions for the $ 30 million prize , they wo n’t be the last .
Prize founder Peter Diamandis expects that several teams will make launch attempts within a handful of years – it seems unlikely that a rover wo n’t succeed before the time limit ends .

Supreme Court Appears Ready to Back an Individual ’s Right to Bear Arms
On March 16th I wrote this post about the supreme court hearing a case about gun control in Washington D.C.
This is a very important case on the second amendment as the supreme court is going to rule on whether individuals have the right to bear arms , or if the amendment only applies to state militias .
The court heard the arguments this morning and will now have several weeks to make a final decision .
It is being reported here , and on Fax News , that the supreme court is prepared to rule that individuals do have the right to keep and bear arms .
The US Supreme Court appears ready to rule that Americans have a constitutional right to keep a gun in their home for self - defence , a ruling that could help Republicans in the upcoming presidential election .
Hearing the most important gun rights case in nearly 70 years , the justices on Tuesday spent 98 minutes engrossed in a lively debate about British and American legal traditions relating to the right to bear arms , especially in self - defence .
The court will now reportedly use the next few weeks to decide on what , or if any restrictions can be placed on gun ownership .
This is a huge victory for second amendment advocates .
This ruling had the possibility of shaking up the very structure of one of the basic rights guaranteed under the constitution .
The court actually had to rule on whether individuals have the right to bear arms , and they are reported to have passed this test .
Now it will be very interesting to see the type of restrictions that they rule are acceptable .
The supreme court seems to have made a great decision on the first part of the argument , now we will see if they continue to support the second amendment with their next decision , which is due in late May or early June .
I have written before about what I feel President Bush ’s most enduring and profound legacy will be when looked back upon many years from now .
I believe that his two supreme court appointees will be and have the most positive effects on the country , and will shape the future of the country for many years to come .
If this decision is a sign of things to come .
we are off to a good start .
As it has become the favorite entry point for undocumented migrants trying to sneak into the United States , Arizona has become a laboratory for whether a state can single - handedly combat illegal immigration .
In recent years it has barred illegal immigrants from receiving government services , from winning punitive damages in lawsuits and from posting bail for serious crimes .
A new state law shuts down businesses that hire illegal workers .
And the sheriff of Maricopa County , which includes Phoenix and three - fifths of the state ’s population , dispatches his deputies and volunteer “ posses ” to search for illegal street vendors or immigrants being smuggled through the county .
“ What I love about what Arizona is doing is we do n’t have to rely on the federal government , ” said state Rep. Russell Pearce , a Mesa Republican who has authored most of the toughest measures .
“ It has truly woken up the rest of America that states can fix that problem . ”
The campaign has had an effect : Illegal immigrants complain it ’s impossible to find good work and are leaving the state .
Advertisement
It has also taken a toll on some U.S. citizens .
Juan Carlos Ochoa , a naturalized U.S. citizen who lives in an upper - middle - class subdivision near Phoenix named Laguna Hills , ca n’t find a job because a government database classifies him as a possible illegal immigrant .
Pauline Munoz , a 39 - year - old mother of six who was born in Phoenix , has been afraid to leave her apartment since being held by sheriff ’s deputies for 15 hours for a driving infraction -- an example of what she believes is racial profiling .
And businesses that cater to immigrants both legal and illegal report a huge drop in sales , increasing the drag on the state ’s already troubled economy .
“ There used to be so many people they would fight for parking out there , ” said Omar Flores , 31 , manager of La Mexicana market in western Phoenix .
Now the grocery store is mostly empty .

Economist Dawn McLaren of Arizona State University said that part of what ’s pushing immigrants out is the collapse of the state ’s housing - based economy .
In the construction sector , which employs many immigrants , 10 % of jobs have vanished over the last year as home prices have plunged .
The economic woes are magnified by the employer sanctions law , which has led some businesses to say they wo n’t expand in Arizona , McLaren said .
“ It exacerbates the downturn , ” she said .
No one knows how many immigrants have left the state , and the most recent government figures show Arizona growing robustly -- as of July , Maricopa was the fastest - growing county in the nation .
But enough immigrants have left that the government of Sonora , the Mexican state bordering Arizona , has complained about how many people have arrived on its doorstep .
Advertisement
Pearce says the overall effect has been undeniably positive for Arizona .
“ Smaller class sizes , shorter emergency room waits , ” he said .
“ Even if [ illegal immigrants ] are paying taxes -- and most of them are n’t -- the cost to taxpayers is huge . ”
The biggest effect has come from the new employer sanctions law , which took effect in January .
The law is fairly straightforward .
Any business caught hiring illegal immigrants is put on probation .
If it is caught doing the same thing again , the state revokes its business license .
Advertisement
The only defense for an employer is if it used E - Verify , a federal pilot project to allow businesses to confirm the legality of their laborers .
The law did what it was supposed to with Jorge Hernandez , a 32 - year - old illegal immigrant from Mexico .
He had been working in a Phoenix tire shop for years when in December his bosses told him they ’d have to let him go because of the new law .
Now he struggles to support his family by working as a day laborer and is thinking of leaving .
“ I ’ve been in Arizona for 11 years , ” he said .
“ This is the worst one .
For those years I worked every day .
I had money , I had a car . ”
Hernandez dreams of moving to New Mexico , where friends have told him the economy is stronger and sentiment against illegal immigrants weaker .
“ They do n’t have E - Verify there , ” he said in Spanish .
Advertisement
E - Verify has at least one significant flaw -- its treatment of naturalized U.S. citizens .
Between October 2006 and March 2007 , about 3,200 foreign - born U.S. citizens were initially improperly disqualified from working by E - Verify .
Their status was later corrected .
Because many did not register their citizenship with the Social Security Administration , they are often listed as possible illegal workers .
That ’s what apparently happened to Ochoa , 47 , who became a citizen in 2000 .
He quit his job as a car salesman at the end of last year and got hired by a local Dodge dealership in February .
Days later , his new employers called him with bad news -- E - Verify classified him as a possible illegal immigrant .
He only had a couple of days to convince Social Security that he was n’t .
Advertisement
He had lost his naturalization certificate , so Ochoa took his U.S. passport , Social Security card , driver ’s license and Arizona voter identification card to the local Social Security office .
He was told he ’d have to request new papers from the Department of Homeland Security , which could take up to 10 months .
“ I love this country , I ’m happy in this country , ” said Ochoa , a father of two , who escaped eviction this month only because a church group paid his rent .
“ The guy who made this law , I do n’t know him .
He ’s started destroying a lot of families . ”
Katherine Lotspeich , acting chief of the agency that runs E - Verify , said officials will introduce a number of changes , starting in May , to make it easier to fix the problems that Ochoa and other naturalized citizens have encountered .
“ The last thing we want is to have people who are naturalized citizens deal with this cumbersome process ” to get paperwork , Lotspeich said .
Advertisement
She added that Social Security should have accepted Ochoa ’s passport as proof of citizenship .
Local law enforcement efforts , meanwhile , have drawn complaints about racial profiling .
For the last two years , Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has been testing how far a local law enforcement agency can go in combating illegal immigration .
His deputies and trained volunteers have detained more than 1,000 illegal immigrants , many of whom were stopped for minor infractions and then asked about their immigration status .
State legislators this month moved toward passing a law requiring all local police departments to start fighting illegal immigration .
“ I believe that if you get tough , ” Arpaio said , illegal immigrants “ will disappear . ”
Advertisement
Immigrant - rights groups and attorneys have complained that Arpaio ’s attack on illegal immigrants leads to Latinos constantly being asked about their citizenship status .
Some cite Munoz ’s case as an example of perils to Arpaio ’s approach .
Munoz was held for 15 hours after being stopped on a speeding violation in Phoenix in December .
Deputies discovered she did not have a driver ’s license .
She was placed in a van with several arrested illegal immigrants , taken to jail and held for several hours of processing before a judge released her .
“ It ’s only because of the way you look , ” Munoz said .
“ Even though I ’m from here , I do n’t feel safe to go out and do anything . ”
Sheriff ’s Capt .
Paul Chagolla , a department spokesman , said Munoz was detained for driving without a license .
She was kept with the illegal immigrants because “ when we run an operation we do n’t always have transport ” for individual suspects , he said .
Advertisement
Arpaio said that there have been few specific complaints of profiling and that his deputies ask suspects about immigration status only when they see a possible crime committed .
He has no apologies for his tactics or their contribution to a flight of illegal immigrants from Arizona .
“ The more who leave , the better , ” he said .
“ They should n’t be here in the first place . ”

The first ever Veruca Salt Award given by TheZoo , after much deliberation by the committee , has been awarded to Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Actually , we could n’t think of anyone more deserving …
The Veruca Salt Award is named in honor of the character from the film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory .
Veruca is a spoiled rotten child , who ’s parents treat her like a princess , who thinks she can take whatever she wants whenever she wants it , and her wants and desires rise above all else .
She embodies the Deadly Sin of Greed , with touches of Envy and Wrath .
A thoroughly unpleasant character , naturally she ends up in the garbage chute .
The awards committee has had their eye on Hillary Clinton for some time now , but this story written by Willyloman , on his blog the American Everyman , finally tipped the scales in her favor .
Hillary ’s response to Barack Obama ’s speech on race in America was typically snide and condescending :
“ That ’s the difference between me and my opponent .
My opponent makes speeches .
I offer solutions .
It is one thing to get people excited .
I want to empower you , ” “ Now , over the years , you ’ve heard plenty of promises from plenty of people in plenty of speeches .
And some of those speeches were probably pretty good .
But speeches do n’t put food on the table .
Speeches do n’t fill up your tank , or fill your prescription , or do anything about that stack of bills that keeps you up at night , ” Reuters
Willyloman took note of Hillary ’s words , and posted these astonishing numbers from her recently released tax returns .
CUMULATIVE TOTAL ( GROSS ) INCOME : $ 109,175,175 Including , among other items : Senator Clinton ’s Senate Salary : $ 1,051,606
President Clinton ’s Presidential Pension : $ 1,217,250
Senator Clinton ’s Book Income : $ 10,457,083
President Clinton ’s Book Income : $ 29,580,525
President Clinton ’s Speech Income : $ 51,855,599 52 million dollars puts a lot of food on the table for most Americans .
Well stated , Willyloman .
What about that stack of bills …?
And since they are given free universal health - care , on our dime , she is n’t spending any nights up worrying about those bills either .
Ca n’t say the same for her campaign staff though .
That ’s right , the Clinton campaign failed to pay the health insurance bills for her staff .
Maybe they should make speeches …?
Even this is n’t enough to qualify Ms Clinton for an award as prestigious as the Veruca Salt Award , you say ?
Well , here are a few things that pushed our winner to the top of the heap :
Hillary Clinton asks pledged Obama delegates in North Dakota to switch .
Hillary Clinton says Obama wants to stop votes .
Hillary Clinton ’s campaign strategist , Mark Penn , forced to apologize for lobbying for a free - trade agreement , supposedly opposed by the Clinton campaign .
Hillary Clinton under fire for false health care horror story .
Hillary Clinton uses the Rev Wright controversy against Obama , lives in glass house .
Hillary Clinton looks like she ’s trying to get McCain elected , so she ’ll have a “ shot ” at 2012 .
Hillary Clinton creates her own reality .
Hillary Clinton ’s role in the Irish peace process not corroborated by official documents .
Hillary Clinton says Bosnian girl was a sniper .
( SATIRE !!
I thought you ’d need a laugh by now )
Hillary Clinton will destroy the Democrat party to try to get what she wants .
Hillary Clinton was for NAFTA before she was against it .
Hillary Clinton campaign tells the Canadian government to take her criticisms of NAFTA with a “ grain of salt . ”
Tries to make it looks like it was actually Obama saying it .
Hillary Clinton pretends she ’s bad at math .
Hillary Clinton claims Obama is not a Muslim “ as far as I know . ”
And finally …
Hillary Clinton is a bald - faced liar .
Congratulations , Hillary Clinton !
You ’re the winner of TheZoo ’s first Veruca Salt Award !!
Though I might hold some political views that have tied me to my party , I am also someone that knows when it is imperative to vote against his own .
The Iraq war was the most critical mistake this country has ever made , and the neocons that were behind it need to be purged from Washington forever .
The fierce urgency of now is what opened me up to Sen.
Barack Obama and the message and hope that he has brought to this nation .
Some say his words are empty or simply " just words " , but for this Republican , no words have ever personally resonated more .
Some say he is inexperienced , but for this Republican , it is clear to me what we do n’t need is the kind of experience that has led us to this precipice .
Some say he is naïve and those that support him are as well , but for me , naive is to not be able to recognize the calculated and strategized politcs of the past that have fooled so many of us .
This is my first diary since officially joining Daily Kos a little over a week ago , and I do n’t pretend to be a master scribe or orator of the axioms of my political beliefs , but recent events have driven me to try to put down some of my thoughts , lest my voice not be heard in these critically important times for our nation .
I read a statement tonight that all of the Republican supporters for Barack were leaving because of all of the Rev .
Wright flack that has been beat like a drum the last several days , especially from the political pundits on the right that were just waiting for their opening .
What I saw from my party two nights ago made me so sick to my stomach that I had to post on this site an apology to my newfound Democratic friends .
Because it was straight from my heart , I felt it appropriate to quote it in its entirety :
My apologies to the Democrats Let me first get this out of the way .
I am a Republican , but I am strongly supporting Sen. Barack Obama .
For the first time in my adult life , I am really proud of the person I am supporting as President of The United States of America .
I could go on and on ad nauseum about all the things that I admire about Barack , but that will need to come at a later day .
That said , I have been watching some of the news coverage tonight concerning the cherry picked speeches from Sen.
Obama ’s pastor .
I think for the most part , CNN and MSNBC have been reasonable in their coverage , all things considered , but when I flipped over to Fox News – just to see how biased their coverage would be on this story – I was appalled .
I had stopped watching Fox News shortly after the start of the Iraq war , but I tune in every now and then just to see how slanted their coverage is .
What I saw tonight from Sean Hannity and some of his panel truly disgusted me .
The agenda to tear down Barack and Michelle was exceedingly clear and I was very disturbed at the level of the message of hatred and destruction .
What in the past I might have trivialized , I now take very personally because I walk in a different set of shoes .
For all of you on the left , center , or in - between that have been the brunt of the personal attacks of the pundits , surrogates , and politicians from the right , just so that they could promote their political and personal agendas at any cost , I sincerely apologize for what my party has done to you .
If I could offer this amend with words stronger than this simple pronouncement , I would , but the verbal expressions of what I wish I could accurately convey to you escape me at the moment , but my convictions do not .
I am truly , truly sorry for what my party has become .
This has got to end .
Yes , this has got to end .
The politics of yesterday must end -- not just for my party , but also for yours .
Without hesitation , I denounce George W. Bush , and by proxy for supporting his policies , Sen. John McCain as well .
The unlikely migration of Republican supporters away from our party in support of Sen. Obama is a very real phenomenon .
Just in my small circle of friends and family , there are eight of us that have made this crossover in support of Barack .
And this is what gets me to the main point of my diary .
Like the struggle for the future of my party , I also see the same thing happening in yours , but with a much more significant impact .
We all see it -- there is a distinct division between the politics of yesterday and future of your party .
One voice represents through words and actions calculated divisiveness , the other voice does its best to stay above it all and set a new standard for what a leader should be in whom we could admire .
This message is for Sen. Clinton and her supporters .
It is over , and it is time to stand behind the future of your party .
It is evident that the scorched earth or " kitchen sink " approach of the campaign is tearing both candidates down .
The recent polls vs. McCain illustrate this point with eye opening and disheartening clarity .
The win at all costs approach down the narrow path to the nomination is ripping your party apart , and for what ?
There is a belief that Sen.
Clinton should stay in the race just in case something would happen to invalidate Sen.
Obama as the nominee , but this is a flawed argument .
If something did happen to cause Barack to step down , then Hillary would be nominated at the convention whether she remained in the race or not .
Sen .
Clinton , by you remaining in the race , the Republicans are getting organized , prepared , and are raising money .
By you staying in the race , all you are doing is providing ammunition and precious time to McCain .
You will also be wasting tens of millions of dollars for a simple gain of a few delegates , which will not get you to the nomination .
We do n’t need any more " 3 a.m. " ads or " ... Sen. Obama brings a speech from 2002 " sound bites .
Sen .
Clinton , the race is over .
Support the party ’s nominee , and go out with dignity .
It is the fierce urgency of now .
CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Coral is again flourishing in the crater left by the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated by the United States , 54 years after the blast on Bikini Atoll , marine scientists said on Tuesday .
Porites matrices grow in the Bravo Crater in this handout photo made available April 14 , 2008 .
Coral is again flourishing in the crater left by the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated by the United States , 54 years after the blast on Bikini Atoll , marine scientists said on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Australian Research Council / Handout
A team of research divers visited Bravo crater , ground zero for the test of a thermonuclear weapon in the remote Marshall Islands on March 1 , 1954 , and found large numbers of fish and coral growing , although some species appeared locally extinct .
“ I did n’t know what to expect , some kind of moonscape perhaps .
But it was incredible , ” Zoe Richards , from Australia ’s James Cook University , told Reuters about the team ’s trip to the atoll in the south Pacific .
“ We saw communities not too far from any coral reef , with plenty of fish , corals and action going on , some really striking individual colonies , ” she said .
The 15 megatonne hydrogen bomb was 1,000 times more powerful than the blast which destroyed Hiroshima , vaporizing islands with temperatures hitting 99,000 Fahrenheit , and shaking islands even up to 124 miles away .
The resulting 4 mile - wide fireball left a crater 1 mile across and 80 yards deep , while the mushroom cloud rose 62 miles over the South Pacific and radioactive fallout reached Australia and Japan .
Richards , from the Australian government - backed Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies , said the research team from Germany , Italy , Hawaii , Australia and the Marshall Islands found corals up to 9 yards high and some with 12 inch - thick trunks .
“ It was fascinating .
I ’ve never seen corals growing like trees outside of the Marshall Islands , ” Richards said .
While above - water areas remained contaminated and unfit for human habitation , healthy sub -sea species probably traveled on strong winds and currents from nearby Rongelap Atoll , which was not bombed in a series of 23 tests between 1946 - 58 .
“ It is absolutely pristine for another tragic reason .
It received fallout and was evacuated of people , so now underwater it ’s really healthy and prevailing winds have probably been seeding Bikini Atoll ’s recovery , ” Richards said .
Compared with a study made before the atomic tests , the team established that 42 species were missing compared to the early 1950s , with at least 28 of those locally extinct .
The team was asked by Marshall Islands authorities to investigate Bikini for the first time since the tests , in part to see if a small diving industry could safely be expanded .
The waters around Bikini are littered with wrecks of old , decommissioned ships sunk during the atomic tests , including the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga and the former Japanese flagship HIJMS Nagato , from which Admiral Yamoto gave the order to attack Pearl Harbour .
Richards said the ability of Bikini ’s corals to bounce back from “ a single huge destructive event ” was proof of their resilience , although that did not mean the threat to corals from climate change had been overestimated .
“ Climate change is an ongoing struggle to survive with coral , with no reprieve in sight , ” she said .
“ After the atomic blasts they had 50 years undisturbed to recover . ”
Fox News Liz Trotta Wants Obama and Osama Dead ( Video )
is a Fox News contributor and former New York bureau chief of The Washington Times .
On May 25 , 2008 , Trotta made news after expressing her personal view on Fox News that U.S. presidential candidateshould be assassinated along with .
Prior to calling for his assassination she referred to Obama as Osama .
Discussing Hillary Rodham Clinton 's controversial reference to Robert F. Kennedy 's June 1968 assassination , she stated :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-AxdVWZFvM
This will be the most controversial piece I ’ve written , but it should not be .
Lest you think that I harbor racial preferences , know that these divisions are utterly against my nature .

Obama , Race , and the Media
I have a problem that has been festering ever since I ’ve been politically aware .
( Yes , that ’s only been eight years .
But that ’s immaterial . )
For me , it has turned from a minor annoyance to near - outrage as I ’ve watched the Presidential campaign unfold .
I keep reading articles that label Barack Obama “ black , ” as if he is the “ black ” candidate for President .
The authors of these pieces , who earn paychecks for getting their facts straight , know that the Senator is both white and black .
He is bi-racial .
However , the media rarely points this out in their coverage , particularly when talking about his appeal to fellow white Americans . *
Thanks to overblown coverage , we know that Obama made regrettable remarks about lingering “ bitterness ” in the American heartland , due to the economic dilapidation of these regions .
I think people object more to his wording than the words themselves .
I happen to agree with his critics to some extent .
According to Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report , “ For undecided voters being asked to support a 46 - year - old black man with a relatively thin résumé on the national or statewide level , this kind of story does not make them comfortable . ”**
Comfortable about what ?
My problem with this statement is not that they merely identified him is “ black , ” but they did so vis - à - vis “ undecided voters ” , or “ whites . ”
The key to understanding these blanket statements about race is to unpack and decode them .
Charlie ’s overall point is clear : Barack Obama is a “ different ” and “ under - qualified ” candidate that many white people wo n’t easily support .
For fairness ’ sake , consider the reverse of Cook ’s statement .
“ For undecided black voters being asked to support this 46 - year - old white man .
. . this kind of story does not make them comfortable . ”
The implication is that blacks must be conditioned into voting for someone of different skin pigmentation than theirs .
How likely is it that this would be said about a white candidate ?
Not very likely .
For example , I doubt that it was written about Rep. Steve Cohen ( D - TN ) , a wrongly rejected member of the Congressional Black Caucus .
Cohen , a white American , represents a majority black district .
Think about it .
Non-white voters have always had to support a white candidate for President of the United States .
( I know , Jesse Jackson had a shot .
But I ’m talking about actual nominees . )
There has n’t been talk of them being “ comfortable ” seeing a white take the office .
My point is that Barack Obama , a bi-racial man , deserves the same media treatment that any other “ main stream ” candidate would get .
These coded statements reveal the range of racial feelings in America , from mistrust to downright animosity across all races .
Do n’t mistake my comments for coming down on whites ; these feelings exist on all sides .
I badly wish that we would overcome these historical racial divisions .
It is a cancer that we have not gotten rid of in 232 years of this nation ’s history .
I am optimistic though , because people voted for Obama in many primaries , largely without regard to race .
Let ’s continue that trend and put Charlie Cook and the media in a different frame of mind when talking about the racial appeal of candidates .
What do you think ?

* I understand that Obama self identifies as African American .
The focus of this piece is n’t on his self - identification , which he obviously has a right to do , but on the fact that the media does not give a candidate , black or half black , equal due in comparison to his counterparts .

At a time when many dioceses are closing down parochial schools for K - 12 students , Benedict stressed the importance of keeping them open , especially to serve immigrants and the underprivileged .
He also used the occasion to clarify limits , saying that although academic freedom is valuable , it must not be used to “ justify positions that contradict the faith and the teaching of the Church . ”

He had additional healing work to do at his evening encounter with Muslim , Jewish , Buddhist , Hindu and Jain religious leaders .
On a previous trip , to his German homeland , Benedict had set off a paroxysm of anger with comments that appeared to denigrate Islam .
He has also offended Jewish leaders by reinstituting a prayer for the conversion of the Jews in the Latin prayers on Good Friday .
On Thursday , he offered an olive branch to Jewish leaders , and affirmed that all religions should have a common goal of working for peace .
But he also issued a challenge , saying that interfaith dialogue that does not deal with existential “ truth ” is insufficient .
And he talked of the need to protect religious freedom , pointing out that religious minorities in some countries are subject to discrimination and prejudice .
For years , victims of abuse in the United States had beseeched the Vatican for a meeting with the pope , first asking John Paul II , who died in 2005 , and finally , six years after the outbreak of the scandal , one was granted .
The scandal affected nearly every diocese in America , revealed more than 5,000 abusive priests and more than 13,000 victims and has cost the church more than $ 2 billion in settlements and legal fees .
It also has cost the church trust and respect , both of which the pope is clearly aimed at restoring .
But reaction from victims and their advocates varied , with some praising the meeting as an important step and others saying that still it was not enough .
“ This is a small , long - over due step forward on a very long road , ” Joelle Casteix , southwestern regional director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests , said in a statement .
“ We ’re confident the meeting was meaningful for the participants and we ’re grateful that these victims have had the courage to come forward and speak up .
Lynx are making a comeback - but they are very rare ( pic : WWF )
A lynx has appeared in the Italian Alps for the first time in 100 years .
The authorities in Italy 's South Tyrol region say the lynx , which crossed the mountains from Switzerland , does not pose a threat to livestock in the area .
The lynx was fitted with a signalling collar after being captured in Switzerland in February .
Lynx were wiped out by hunters and farmers in the region in the early 20th Century .
They were reintroduced in Switzerland in the 1970s .
On Friday the South Tyrol authorities said the lynx spotted in the area had wandered through the Pejo Valley and had stopped in the Deutschnonsberg area of South Tyrol .
The WWF conservation organisation says there are about 100 lynx in Switzerland , in two main areas : the northwestern Alps , which includes Interlaken , and the Jura Mountains near Lake Geneva .
Lynx are solitary hunters , inhabiting high - altitude forests and preying on small mammals such as hares , foxes and small deer as well as fish .
WWF Italy spokesman Riccardo Nigro told the BBC News website that lynx " are fully protected in Italy " .
But he said carnivores such as bear , lynx and wolves could be a risk in some places because alpine communities had forgotten simple preventive measures such as low - voltage fences and dogs trained to defend cattle .
An Italian programme to reintroduce bears to the Alps suffered a setback when one - nicknamed Bruno - ventured into Austria and Germany and preyed on local livestock .
Bruno dodged Bavarian hunters for weeks before being shot dead in June 2006 .

“ According to George Cook of WVNET this cluster has been up for over 10 years .
WVNET is the West Virginia Network , a dynamic service organization providing telecommunications and computing services within West Virginia .
WVNET was created in 1975 to provide central computing facilities and wide - area network communications linking its ‘ central site ’ computing resources in Morgantown with the campus computing systems at most of the colleges and universities throughout the state .
The cluster consists of an Alpha 4100 ( with four 533 Mhz CPUs ) running VMS 7.3 - 2 ; a VAX 6000 - 630 running VMS 7.3 ; and four DEC 3000 workstations running VMS 7.3 - 2 . ”
“ ISO should hang their heads in shame for allowing it to happen . ”
– Tim Bray
F rom this point onwards , it is worth starting to argue in favour of ODF because of its merits rather than its ISO rubber stamp .
Microsoft has single - handedly redefined the meaning and significance of ISO .
It rendered ISO moot .
The aggressive lobbying ( and at times even well - documented bribery ) has not gone unnoticed .
It has gone well over the fine line and even involved bullying , smear campaigns , and libel .
“ The problem is that reports from there transcend borders and can then ‘ poison ’ the minds of readers in other countries .
” We continue to find disturbing stories which tend to escape the media ’s attention and rarely by coincidence .
That in its own right is equally appalling and we shall soon cover Glyn ’s Moody piece which is titled “ In Praise of Journalistic Scum ” .
You may recall , especially if you are a long - time reader , that the Philippines was on many occasions criticised for biased reporting on OOXML .
The problem is that reports from there transcend borders and can then ‘ poison ’ the minds of readers in other countries .
As a refresher to one ’s memory , one might wish to read :
Another new article from the Philippines seems more like an imbalanced informercial ( more on informercials in general here ) .
Among various bits it contains , the following statement is worth highlighting .
Though obviously elated by the development , the local subsidiary of Microsoft Corp. chose to highlight in its official statement the “ transparent ” process which the BPS adopted in resolving the issue .
This is far from the first time that a country wrongly defends the transparency of the “ process ” rather than the so - called “ standard ” .
This is a bald - faced lie , as we have shown many times before [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] .
Are we seeing manufactured lies here [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , which rely on the public being misinformed and too trusting ?
What what is being said in Malaysia , which has been more honest then most .
What is the point is that we have collectively , globally , bore witness to an awesome display of power by a single corporation .
Awesome .
Ruthless , even .
That Microsoft would fight in every nook and cranny , every possible avenue , every committee , sub - committee , sub - sub - committee , upwards , downwards and sideways to the committees , is simply astounding .
That Microsoft can and did encourage the final decision makers to ignore the wishes of their own standards bodies , majorities be damned , is further affirmation of this awesome display . [...]
However , it was awesome .
One company , Microsoft , against all comers , all over the world .
Simply , awfully , awesome .
Pieter has posted a bogus press release on April Fools Day , but the sad fact is that it ’s exactly the type of press release we ought to see later today .
Geneva , 1 April 2008 .
The International Organization for Standardization announced at a press conference that its processes are “ broken ” and “ need radical reform ” .
ISO president Håkan Murby told journalists that “ the Microsoft OOXML process was a near - disaster and we want to make sure such a thing never happens again . ”
Instead , prepare ISO to continue to pretend that it's all business as usual , sweeping under the carpet all the abuses of the process , boosted by Microsoft and ECMA press releases .
“ We are winning !!!!!!!!!!!!! ”
Of course , those of us who have watched this closely will always know that this so - called ‘ standard ’ is not really a standard .
It was brought to ISO using abuse , even crime .
When is a Standard Not a Standard ? [...]
So , now we come to the present day , and an ongoing battle about which relatively few people , compared to the world population , know or understand .
The battle lines were drawn , the positions chosen , and the war began .
Microsoft ca n’t stop ODF from being a standard – ODF has already achieved the status .
To quote the father of MXL ( on the OOXML BRM specifically ) : “ process irretrievably broken … complete , utter , unadulterated bullsh*t . ”
To quote ISO itself :
“ This year WG1 have had another major development that has made it almost impossible to continue with our work within ISO .
The influx of P members whose only interest is the fast - tracking of ECMA 376 as ISO 29500 has led to the failure of a number of key ballots .
Though P members are required to vote , 50 % of our current members , and some 66 % of our new members , blatantly ignore this rule despite weekly email reminders and reminders on our website .
As ISO require at least 50 % of P members to vote before they start to count the votes we have had to reballot standards that should have been passed and completed their publication stages at Kyoto .
This delay will mean that these standards will appear on the list of WG1 standards that have not been produced within the time limits set by ISO , despite our best efforts .
The disparity of rules for PAS , Fast - Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles .
The days of open standards development are fast disappearing .
Instead we are getting “ standardization by corporation ” , something I have been fighting against for the 20 years I have served on ISO committees .
I am glad to be retiring before the situation becomes impossible .
I wish my colleagues every success for their future efforts , which I sincerely hope will not prove to be as wasted as I fear they could be . ”

Formerly Convenor , ISO / IEC JTC1 / SC34 WG1

" Weyrich was furious when he learned of the excision of the public transportation section :
" It is disappointing that after the paragraphs indicated were passed by a nine to three vote that someone without ever asking me would see to it to do away with these important policy considerations , Weyrich said to NCI . "
It is the kind of gutter politics which make people hate their government , and Washington in general . "
" Weyrich , who founded the Heritage Foundation and also founded and is chairman of the Free Congress Foundation , has been a leader of the American conservative movement since the days of the Reagan Administration .
He is also one of the most knowledgeable and sought after supporters of public transportation especially light rail , in America . "
The press release contains " the full text of what Weyrich wrote , adopted by the full commission , and then mysteriously disappeared from the official version of the report :
The Case for Public Transportation
" It is the view of the Commission that public transportation , especially in the form of electric railways , must and will play a significantly larger role in Americans ' mobility .
Federal transportation policy should not only accommodate but encourage this development .... "
The section discusses the societal and environmental benefits of public transit investment , including congestion relief , energy security , air quality and climate protection , and urban re-development .
It even includes historical information describing how public road investment , dating back to 1921 , set the private electric railways on a downward spiral .

Federal agents at the border do not need any reason to search through travelers ' laptops , cell phones or digital cameras for evidence of crimes , a federal appeals court ruled Monday , extending the government 's power to look through belongings like suitcases at the border to electronics .
The unanimous three - judge decision reverses a lower court finding that digital devices were " an extension of our own memory " and thus too personal to allow the government to search them without cause .
Instead , the earlier ruling said , Customs agents would need some reasonable and articulable suspicion a crime had occurred in order to search a traveler 's laptop .
On appeal , the government argued that was too high a standard , infringing upon its right to keep the country safe and enforce laws .
Civil rights groups , joined by business traveler groups , weighed in , defending the lower court ruling .
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the government , finding that the so - called border exception to the Fourth Amendment 's prohibition on unreasonable searches applied not just to suitcases and papers , but also to electronics .
The ruling ( .pdf ) came in a case where customs agents searched the laptop of Michael Arnold who was returning from the Philippines .
They found images they believed to be child pornography , seized the laptop and later arrested him .
While the lower court ruling excluded from trial the pictures of young boys the government says it found on the hard drive , they now can be used again .
The panel chose to follow the reasoning of a similar case from the 4th Circuit , known as Ickes ( .pdf ) , which held that the government did not need any reason to search a vehicle crossing the border .
The 9th's ruling did not , however , clarify whether a traveler has to help the government search his computer , by providing the login information , or what would happen when the government decided to search a laptop with encrypted data on the drive .
The defendant in the case can appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court , but the Court is unlikely to take up an issue that two separate appeals courts have agreed upon .
In the meantime , travelers should be aware that anything on their mobile devices can be searched by government agents , who may also seize the devices and keep them for weeks or months .
When in doubt , think about whether online storage or encryption might be tools you should use to prevent the feds from rummaging through your journal , your company 's confidential business plans or naked pictures of you and your - of - age partner in adult fun .
The case is Arnold vs. USA .

In the violent tangle that is sex between giant squids , almost anything can happen , including accidentally injecting yourself with firehose - pressure blasts of sperm .
The report goes on : " Although mating has never been observed in giant squid , it is thought that what happens is that the male injects his sperm packages into the female 's arms .
The process is likely to be a fairly violent affair as the female is probably not that keen on being injected .
This is a problem for the amorous male as females are normally a third bigger than they are .
" But males get round their inferior size by being endowed with a particularly long penis , which means they can inject the female without having to get too close to her chomping beak .
The male 's sexual organ is actually a bit like a high - pressure fire hose and is normally nearly as long as his body – excluding legs and head .
" But having such a big penis does have one drawback : it seems that co-ordinating eight legs , two feeding tentacles and a huge penis , whilst fending off an irate female , is a bit too much to ask , and one of the two males stranded on the Spanish coast had accidentally injected himself with sperm packages in the legs and body .
And this does not seem to have been an isolated incident since two of the eight males that had stranded in the north - east Atlantic before had also accidentally inseminated themselves .

John Donahoe Handout ONLINE AUCTION SALES ONLINE AUCTION SALES EBay is the dominant player in a worldwide market whose growth is slowing .
Year Sales ( 1 ) % of total retail sales 2005 $ 22 1.0 % 2006 $ 26 1.1 % 2007 $ 30 1.3 % 2008 $ 34 1.4 % 2009 $ 38 1.4 % 2010 $ 42 1.5 % 2011 $ 45 1.5 % 2012 $ 47 1.5 % 1 - in billions ; Note : 2008 - 2012 are projections ; Source : Jupiter Research SAN FRANCISCO 
The biggest boycott by eBay ( EBAY ) sellers concludes Monday , capping a week of acrimony after the online - auction site raised fees and changed its feedback policy .
Auction listings on eBay.com dropped some 13 % since the strike started Feb. 18 to about 13 million items , according to third - party tracking sites such as dealscart.com and medved .
net .
The boycott , amid slowing growth and intensifying competition from Amazon and Google , could presage a challenging year for John Donahoe , eBay 's incoming CEO , say analysts .
Like dozens of other boycotts against eBay the past few years , this protest is largely over pricing changes .
Though many previous boycotts have fizzled after a few days , the most recent gained more attention through protest - related actions on YouTube and MySpace .
" If ( eBay 's listings total ) falls below 12 million , we 've made a pretty good impact , " said Nancy Baughman , an eBay PowerSeller who deals antiques and collectibles .
She is also co-author of a book on online auctions .
Jim Griffith , dean of eBay Education , declined to comment on third - party statistics , and said that the site 's internal statistics show the boycott " has had no impact on our listings . "
EBay does not publicly release its listings totals .
Fluctuations in eBay 's listings can be hard to interpret due to seasonal swings .
Complicating matters , eBay ran a one - day promotion Feb. 13 offering steep discounts of fees , which pushed listings up more than 20 % .
Still , the impact of the boycott is evident , says David Steiner , president of AuctionBytes.com , a publication for online merchants .
" The protestors made a loud statement . "
Donahoe , who becomes eBay 's CEO in March , recently announced changes to the fees eBay charges .
The cost to list items will be cut 25 % to 50 % , but the commission that eBay charges for completed sales increased , starting last Wednesday .
As of May , sellers will no longer be able to leave negative feedback comments for buyers .
" When I heard the changes , I thought it was April Fool 's Day , " Valerie Lennert , one of the boycott organizers , says , referring to the changes in fees and feedback .
She sells doll clothes on eBay .
Lennert has spread her message with an anti-eBay video on YouTube .
The video has been viewed 140,000 times .
The protestors also created a MySpace page .
Despite the protest , eBay is not considering altering or postponing its policies , Griffith says .
" A lot of deliberation went into these decisions , " he says .

For China , the Olympics are about more than sporting prowess and pride I was in Beijing on the hot summer 's night in 2001 when it was announced that the Olympic Games would be awarded to the world 's most populous nation .
We had squeezed into an outdoor atrium a mile or so from the Forbidden City on the broad Chang An Avenue that was once - a long time ago - filled with 10 lanes of bicycles and is now clogged with dense urban traffic .
Giant screens broadcast the voices of IOC officials radiating with the charisma of Swiss bank managers .
Their downbeat delivery jarred with the bubbling hysteria of the crowd around us , screaming " Beijing Erlingbai , Beijing Erlingbai ! " , Beijing 2008 , Beijing 2008 in high - pitched anticipation .
As the announcement was read out , there was a hushed silence , in which you could only hear the cicadas and the hum of distant traffic .
Suddenly the crowd erupted into euphoria .
A young bespectacled student next to me burst into tears .
His girlfriend sank to the ground .
A group of sweating students came up to me and shouted : " You see , China is the best ... we are the biggest and now we are the best ! "
Coming - out party
Whenever a city gets the Olympics , there are scenes of jubilation .
London went wild for a night when it got the Games in 2005 .
In Sydney , I witnessed the sporting pride of a nation in love with the outdoors .
Australia was keen to use the spotlight to introduce the world to the land " down under " .
The Chinese have come to the conclusion that the West values economic interest far more highly than democracy - and who can blame them ?
Send us your comments
But the Beijing Olympics were never just about the pride of a city or the sporting prowess of Chinese athletes , or indeed the tourist board 's desire to introduce the globe to Dim Sum , Sichuan folk dresses and the Terracotta Army .
For China , the Games are a coming - out party for an emerging super - power , a chance to prove to the world that it deserves to be respected , that it has finally shaken off the yoke of Communist isolation or colonial occupation .
The Games will put a human face to all those economic statistics that the world has marvelled at for so many years .
In Beijing , the Olympics will not just be a sporting event .
They will be a national celebration .
Compare it to the perfect wedding of an arranged marriage .
It is less about the love between bride and groom and more about the canapes , the placement and the 600 carefully chosen family guests .
Last minute objections are a definite no - no .
The claim that this is just another international sporting event simply does not wash .
The Chinese themselves do not see it that way .
The Olympics have always been prone to political meddling .
They are after all a competition between nation states and not individual sportsmen and women .
There is nothing unusual about the Chinese using the Olympics to gain the respect of the international community .
But if granting that respect involves a tacit acceptance of bloodshed or excessive force , plastered on TV screens , then an appearance at the party could become an embarrassment .
People will make this judgement on their own terms .
Slap in the face Stephen Spielberg decided in February that he could not continue as artistic director of the Games , saying China was not doing enough to pressure Sudan to end the killings and violence in Darfur .
The Chinese were furious .
The Chinese will see any boycott of the Olympics as a slap in the face Now the situation in Tibet is making others reconsider .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has hinted that the opening ceremony may have to be boycotted .
Barack Obama has urged President Bush to consider staying away unless China 's human rights record improves .
Hillary Clinton has made a similar call , although it is worth pointing out that as First Lady she did go to China in 1996 for the international women 's conference despite calls for her not to attend because of Beijing 's human rights abuses .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has declared that he will only attend the closing ceremony - the diplomatic equivalent of smoking without inhaling .
But the Chinese have a zero - tolerance policy for even the faintest whiff of dissent and any form of boycott will be perceived as a slap in the face for a nation which cares deeply about saving face .
For their part , the pro-Tibetan demonstrators know this is their opportunity to hurt China where they have failed even to scratch its hide in recent decades .
They will protest all the way to the closing ceremony .
As the demonstrations get more heated , the torch more imperilled and the questions more acute , other actors will be forced to reassess .
Most Western governments and businesses like a China that is stable and hides its discontent and dirty business from public view .
So after two decades the Chinese have come to the conclusion that the West values economic interest far more highly than democracy .
And who can blame them ?
Humiliated The Chinese have had their way over Tibet .
They have openly intimidated those countries who want to have diplomatic relations with Taiwan .
And from their point of view , the Tibetans are an ungrateful bunch of peasants who have been dragged from the Dark Age of a Buddhist theocracy to the modern era of paved roads , city plumbing and light bulbs .
China 's attempts brought modernity to Tibet but it has not always been welcome I travelled through China as a student in 1984 when the country was largely closed to outsiders .
I stayed in Taerse , a stunning Tibetan monastery on the edge of the Tibetan plateau .
This home to hundreds of Tibetan monks had been saved by Zhou Enlai during the Cultural Revolution , as the Chinese mobs prepared to level it to the ground .
He felt it was simply too beautiful to be left to the mercies of those wielding the axe in one hand and the Little Red Book in the other .
One day , bus loads of Chinese tourists in Mao uniforms arrived .
They lined the dirt road to the monastery and laughed openly at the monks and pilgrims who were approaching on their knees as custom dictates .
Some shouted abuse .
Some even spat .
I asked them why they had done that .
" Look , " a woman with thick , black - rimmed spectacles wearing a blue Mao suit told me .
" They are like cave people . "
You do not pick a fight with your banker , especially when your economy is in trouble
China may have brought electrical power to Tibet but it has also humiliated its recipients for decades , forced the Dalai Lama to stay in exile and imprisoned his chosen successor , the Panchen Lama , when he was just a six - year - old boy , appointing another Tibetan boy in his place .
Now that bubble of humiliation , oppression and quiet suffering has burst .
The Tibetans know that 2008 is perhaps their only chance to force the world outside Hollywood and what President George W Bush told me in February was " the Dalai Lama crowd " to take note .
From governments to Western companies sponsoring the Olympics , all will have to make choices as the protests continue .
To boycott or not to boycott .
To incur the wrath of China or not .
These will become ever more pressing questions , sharpened in the US by the demands of the presidential election campaign and a hinterland of Sinophobia ranging from toxic toys to outsourced jobs .
President Bush told me in February that he does not support any boycott .
He knows better than anyone how much Chinese investment now underwrites the US economy , how many billions of dollars in US treasury bonds are owned by China .
And let 's face it : you do not pick a fight with your banker , especially when your economy is in trouble .
Fear of chaos The Chinese , too , will have to make choices .
Do they live up to their vow to crack down on any dissent ?
Do they care more about the placement , the canapes and the band at the wedding than about the couple at the altar ?
What motivates them in their hardline rhetoric towards keeping the torch alight and the Olympics free of dissent is , as ever , fear of chaos .
If they are seen to give in over Tibet , they believe it will soon be open season on China 's brittle unity .
Such is the paranoia of dictatorships .
The wedding would be off and the marquee burned to the ground .
I end back on that clammy night in Beijing .
Amid the euphoria and the crowds , we began to notice armoured vehicles on Chang An .
It was the first time since the violent suppression of protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 that the military had been deployed on the streets of the capital .
The Chinese do not like large gatherings of crowds , even patriotic ones , if they display too much emotion .
Events could go off - script .
That was the mistake of 1989 .
The men and women living in the modern Forbidden City , Zhongnanhai , the heavily guarded home of the party elite , simply do not trust their own people .
This may not be a sound basis on which to host a sporting event that is by its very nature unpredictable , but it is the reality of an emerging super - power in which we are all heavily invested .
And the hapless little torch making its way around the globe this week is shedding a glaring light on some very inconvenient truths about our relationship with China .

Combining Naive Bayes and n- Gram Language Models for Text Classification
Fuchun Peng , Department of Computer Science , University of Massachusetts at Amherst

Full Text : ecir03.ps
We augment the naive Bayes model with an n�gram lan� guage model to address two shortcomings of naive Bayes text classifiers .
The chain augmented naive Bayes classifiers we propose have two ad� vantages over standard naive Bayes classifiers .
First , a chain augmented naive Bayes model relaxes some of the independence assumptions of naive Bayes --- allowing a local Markov chain dependence in the observed variables --- while still permitting e#cient inference and learning .
Second , smoothing techniques from statistical language modeling can be used to recover better estimates than the Laplace smoothing techniques usu� ally used in naive Bayes classification .
Our experimental results on three real world data sets show that we achieve substantial improvements over standard naive Bayes classification , while also achieving state of the art performance that competes with the best known methods in these cases .

With the green theme growing in popularity across every stretch of the world , more and more people are turning to cargo container homes for green alternatives for office , and even new home , construction .
There are countless numbers of empty , unused shipping containers around the world just sitting on the shipping docks and taking up space .
The reason for this is that it ’s too expensive for a country to ship empty containers back to the their origin in most cases , it ’s just cheaper to buy new containers from Asia .
The result is an extremely high surplus of empty shipping containers that are just waiting to become someone ’s home or office .
Design , buy or build your shipping container home today !
And click here for an additional 70 Works of Recycled Art and Design .
There are plenty of benefits of to the so - called shipping container architecture model .
A few of these advantages include : they are plentiful , they are easily transported , they ’re stackable , relatively inexpensive ( as little as $ 900 for a used container ) , they can be prefabricated , and they ’re extremely durable .
Residential applications are also becoming a popular topic of conversation among green supporters .
The first official 2 - story shipping container home in the US was designed by Southern California architect Peter DeMaria in 2006 .
The only big obstacle that he encountered during construction of his shipping container pad was making sure that the house passed all of the strict guidelines of the Uniform Building Code ( UBC ) .
In other parts of the world , places like Odessa , Ukraine already have the the biggest shopping mall in all of Europe which uses stacked shipping containers to form alleys throughout the 170 acre site .
In Asia , the Dordoy Bazaar in Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan is almost entirely composed of empty shipping containers stacked two high and chock - full of inexpensive trinkets and toys .
So , in other words , shipping container architecture is nothing new , but it is new when it comes to residential and office applications .
This great example of shipping container architecture was created by architects Pieter Peelings and Silvia Mertens of Sculp ( IT ) .
They live and work in these shipping containers which are stacked four high .
The entire space is 2.4 meters wide by 5.5 meters deep by 12 meters high .
The bottom floor is used for work , dining room is located on the second floor , relaxation room on the third , and spectacular rooftop views from the fourth – including a relaxing spa .
This award - winning office design by Clive Wilkinson is made out of stacked shipping containers is the home office of Palotta TeamWorks , a US charity event company .
The 47,000 square foot warehouse is filled with shipping containers that have been transformed into modern office spaces .
This design layout saved the company a ton of money on construction costs , and it allowed the entire space to be more open and airy .
The world ’s first hotel built from recycled shipping containers has popped - up in Uxbridge , West London .
Each prefabricated container comes fully - equipped with fixtures , furniture , and windows from a factory in China .
The company , called Travelodge , says that constructing a hotel this way is 25 % faster and 10 % cheaper than the more traditional construction methods .
Also , construction is much quicker , because all that has to be done is to fit each container together like it was a giant Lego set .
Rooms at this London hotel start at about 19 EU per night .
The London area may see more these ‘ portable hotels ’ pop-up around the city as the 2012 Olympics approaches .
Opened in 1998 , the Simon ’s Town High School Hostel is constructed almost entirely of used shipping containers .
This amazing place is constructed out of 40 large shipping containers to be exact , and it ’s big enough to accommodate up to 120 boarders .
The hostel manager gets his own 2 bedroom flat , while the other staff share 2 separate flatlets .
Area residents were concerned that the project would prove to be an eyesore to the community since it was made from grungy old shipping containers , but the final result proved otherwise with a modern - looking structure that is incredibly durable and aesthetically pleasing at the same time .
This shipping container home from the so - called Zigloo Domestique project in Victoria , British Columbia , Canada is a residential home created by Keith Dewey .
The home is built out of old shipping containers , and the owner chose to paint them with an industrial strength minty - green enamel , commonly found on shipping containers today , in order to maintain the container ’s roots in the shipping business .
While the exterior of the home may look a little rugged , due to the protruding containers , the 2,000 square foot interior of the house is quite comfortable and modern .
The project cost about $ 150 per square foot , compared to a similar quality traditional construction project that can cost about $ 250 per square foot .
This stunning home is almost like a piece of art that you can live in .
Constructed using 12 recycled shipping containers , the 12 container home home has all of the modern conveniences of a traditionally built home but with a unique element of style as well .
A modern kitchen , huge wide - open floor plan , and gigantic windows that bring in tons of natural lighting are just a few of the great features of this home – plus , construction costs were relatively inexpensive when compared to traditional construction .
This 2,000 square foot home , built in 2001 , is actually built around a smaller cottage - style house that has stood in that location for decades .
The cottage house almost looks like a gigantic version of a dollhouse inside of the huge storage shed that forms the exterior of this innovative house .
The 3 bedroom 2.5 bath home is also made from 5 large shipping containers – 3 on the bottom , and 2 stacked on top of those .
This place also contains all of the modern features of a ‘ normal ’ home , but it ’s supposedly built to last much longer .
The creator of this innovative home is Adam Kalkin , and he ’s actually selling these homes for as little as $ 76,000 , or less than $ 100 per square foot .. not a bad deal considering traditional construction of a new home averages about double that amount .
This 3,000 square foot L.A. home features multiple storage containers in its design – each with its own purpose .
There ’s a storage container for the entertainment area , library , dining room / office space , master bedroom , and bathroom / laundry room .
This place has plenty of large windows which provide plenty of natural lighting as well as awesome views of the garden and koi pond outside .
Aside from using recycled storage containers , this home also uses recycled steel scraps in its construction which further adds to the green vibe that this home resonates – not to mention saved a ton of money on construction costs .
Almost everyone has signaled thumbs up on a Federal Communications Commission plan that would allow AM radio stations to duplicate their programming on FM translators .
The formal comment period for the proceeding has concluded , but filings keep arriving .
The latest came in on February 8th from Rep. Wayne Gilchrest ( R - MD ) , endorsing the remarks of his constituent , Richard Gelfman , owner of Chestertown AM oldies station WCTR , " The Town . "
" We strongly urged the Federal Communications Commission to adopt new rules which would allow daytime only stations such as ourselves to better serve local communities by granting the right to use FM translators ( or any other means ) to operate at night , " Gelfman wrote .
" As a matter of fact , without this ability , I do not believe that daytime AM stations can continue to survive . "
Over 200 comments have been filed in this proceeding , most of them in favor of the idea .
But several media reform groups have raised questions about the proposal , especially its impact on communities that hope to build Low Power FM ( LPFM ) stations in their area .
Filling in " coverage gaps ? "
Many AM stations have to dramatically reduce their signal power at night because of " skywave propagation " — in the wee hours the AM frequency can hit the ionosphere and travel hundreds of miles beyond its designated local service area , causing interference .
Unless the FCC has designated the station as a " clear channel " licensee , allowed to broadcast long distances at night , or permits it to operate on " flea power " — greatly reducing its signal — the station must shut down .
Since 1970 , the Commission has limited the use of FM translators for extending the broadcasts of other FM stations .
But in July of 2006 , the National Association of Broadcasters ( NAB ) petitioned the FCC to allow AM stations to operate FM translators as well .
The NAB argued that such a rule change would allow many of the nation 's estimated 4,814 stations to fill in " coverage gaps " and provide more local programming .
" For instance , " NAB wrote , " daytime stations that currently air tape - delayed coverage of the local high school 's sporting events or a local political debate because they must turn off their transmitter at sundown , will now be able to do so live . "
NAB filings on this issue also point out that women and minorities have a significance presence in AM radio .
And so the Media Bureau of the FCC launched a 90 - day proceeding on the question in early November of last year .
Their proposal would allow FM translators as long as the night time service does not extend beyond a 25 - mile radius of the AM site , or the daytime coverage area of the station , whichever is smallest .
A hodgepodge of smaller , locally - based AM station owners quickly wrote in to support the proposal , among them Virginia 's Christian Broadcasting Service , which operates six AM stations , and a consortium of AM " daytimer station " groups in and around Kentucky led by Big River Radio , Inc .
Many complain that they have lost audience to the iPod , and satellite and Internet radio .
" All daytimer stations are at a competitive disadvantage , and generally cannot provide good nighttime service to their communities of license , " the Big River group wrote to the FCC in early December .
Other station filings , such as Gelfman of WCTR's , extol the unique local coverage that they provide : high school and college sports , local government meetings , and agricultural weather forecasts .
" In our town , Chesterton , there is one newspaper — a weekly — and we are the only other source of local news and events , " Gelfman wrote .
" Our service to our local community should not be so seriously limited by rules that require us , a vital community resource , to go off the air . "
Giving to AM ; taking from low - power FM
But a sympathetic filing submitted by Clear Channel Communications in January probably did not help the cause of these local broadcasters .
Clear Channel owns 1,100 radio stations across the US and praised the plan as one that will " enhance competition , foster localism and promote diversity . "
Shortly after their comment came one of the few statements critical of the proposal , jointly filed by the LPFM advocacy group Prometheus Radio Project and the Media Access Project ( MAP ) .
The Prometheus / Media Access comment reminds the FCC that not all AM stations provide local coverage to their communities ; many , in fact do not at all .
But the translator proposal could take spectrum space from potential LPFM license owners , whose applicants have to prove to the Commission that they enjoy an " established community presence " and are committed to " local program origination . "
" Allocating FM spectrum to AM stations that may or may not provide local content is not an effective way to increase localism , " Prometheus / MAP wrote to the Commission on February 4 , " a more effective way to promote localism is to allocate spectrum to LPFM licensees who pledge a commitment to localism . "
The FCC has launched another proceeding on operation and licensing rules for these community based , nonprofit stations , which can broadcast at a maximum of 100 watts of power .
And Representative Michael Doyle of Pennsylvania has proposed legislation that would liberalize the rules for LPFM , since an FCC commissioned study indicated that these licenses do not threaten full power stations , as the NAB and National Public Radio claimed in the late 1990s .
In late November , the Commission recommended to Congress that it remove requirements that LPFM stations protect full power stations operating on third adjacent channels .
The Prometheus / MAP filing also notes that while female and minority ownership rates are better for AM than for FM stations , they 're still " abysmal , " at 6.63 percent for women and 10.65 percent for minorities .
" The proposed rule would do nothing to increase the number of minority and female owners , " the comment warns , and could make the situation even worse by making AM stations more valuable , " attracting women and minority buy - outs from well funded corporations . "
But the statement does suggest conditions for AM to FM translator rules that Prometheus and MAP see as acceptable .
AM stations may access FM translators only as a " fill - in " — presumably when some important event requires broadcast coverage in the early morning , evening , or night
Only " standalone " stations may employ FM translators .
" Many AM stations are owned by large companies , " Prometheus writes , " and the interests of large companies should not be allowed to hide behind the interests of survival of genuine small businesses "
One FM translator per standalone AM station
No translator should go to an AM station that also owns an FM outlet in the same market .
It 's unclear when the FCC will make a decision on this issue , but given that even the most skeptical commenters make allowance for the proposal , chances are that we 'll eventually see some relaxation of the Commission 's FM translator rules .
Hope for new way to destroy MRSA
The government has set a target to halve MRSA rates by 2008 British scientists are working on a new way to combat the superbug MRSA .
Researchers at Brighton - based Destiny Pharma are testing a bactericidal compound in the hope it can be used in hospitals by 2011 .
Official figures show in the last three months of last year there were more than 1,000 cases of MRSA in England .
Campaign group MRSA
Action cautiously welcomed the news and called for more funding for research .
Bacteria have a habit of being able to get round any treatments we develop
Derek Butler
MRSA Action
The new compound , codenamed XF - 73 , is applied as a gel into patients ' noses .
Tests showed that the compound destroyed the five most common strains of MRSA in the nasal passage - and that the bug was unable to develop resistance , even after repeated exposure .
More tests ' needed '
The firm presented its findings to the European Congress on Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Barcelona last month .
However , critics said that was no evidence that killing MRSA in the nasal passage would prevent patients developing fatal infections , as the bug can be found anywhere on the body .
Derek Butler , chairman of MRSA Action , said he was interested in " anything in the development of cures or treatment for MRSA " and was hopeful the research would prove beneficial .
But he added : " I think more tests need to be done on it .
We need to be careful in saying we have beaten the resistance problem .
" Bacteria have a habit of being able to get round any treatments we develop . "
A Department of Health spokesman said " a close watch " would be maintained on all emerging findings regarding the superbug .
The latest official figures show recent drops in the number of new MRSA infections seem to have stalled .
Cases in England rose by 0.6 % between October and December 2007 to 1,087 , the Health Protection Agency said last month .
It comes after a series of continuous drops in infections since April 2006 .
Last September , Prime Minister Gordon Brown ordered all hospitals to deep clean , to tackle the spread of infections , such as MRSA .
But the Conservatives said the programme was a shambles as not all the money promised to cover the costs of cleaning had materialised .
Cleaning firms said ministers should instead have properly funded day - to - day cleaning .

MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif . 
Many parts of America , long considered the breadbasket of the world , are now confronting a once unthinkable phenomenon : food rationing .
Major retailers in New York , in areas of New England , and on the West Coast are limiting purchases of flour , rice , and cooking oil as demand outstrips supply .
There are also anecdotal reports that some consumers are hoarding grain stocks .
At a Costco Warehouse in Mountain View , Calif. , yesterday , shoppers grew frustrated and occasionally uttered expletives as they searched in vain for the large sacks of rice they usually buy .
" Where 's the rice ? " an engineer from Palo Alto , Calif. , Yajun Liu , said .
" You should be able to buy something like rice .
This is ridiculous . "
The bustling store in the heart of Silicon Valley usually sells four or five varieties of rice to a clientele largely of Asian immigrants , but only about half a pallet of Indian - grown Basmati rice was left in stock .
A 20 - pound bag was selling for $ 15.99 .
" You can't eat this every day .
It 's too heavy , " a health care executive from Palo Alto , Sharad Patel , grumbled as his son loaded two sacks of the Basmati into a shopping cart .
" We only need one bag but I 'm getting two in case a neighbor or a friend needs it , " the elder man said .
The Patels seemed headed for disappointment , as most Costco members were being allowed to buy only one bag .
Moments earlier , a clerk dropped two sacks back on the stack after taking them from another customer who tried to exceed the one - bag cap .
" Due to the limited availability of rice , we are limiting rice purchases based on your prior purchasing history , " a sign above the dwindling supply said .
Shoppers said the limits had been in place for a few days , and that rice supplies had been spotty for a few weeks .
A store manager referred questions to officials at Costco headquarters near Seattle , who did not return calls or e-mail messages yesterday .
An employee at the Costco store in Queens said there were no restrictions on rice buying , but limits were being imposed on purchases of oil and flour .
Internet postings attributed some of the shortage at the retail level to bakery owners who flocked to warehouse stores when the price of flour from commercial suppliers doubled .
The curbs and shortages are being tracked with concern by survivalists who view the phenomenon as a harbinger of more serious trouble to come .
" It 's sporadic .
It 's not every store , but it 's becoming more commonplace , " the editor of SurvivalBlog.com , James Rawles , said .
" The number of reports I 've been getting from readers who have seen signs posted with limits has increased almost exponentially , I 'd say in the last three to five weeks . "
Spiking food prices have led to riots in recent weeks in Haiti , Indonesia , and several African nations .
India recently banned export of all but the highest quality rice , and Vietnam blocked the signing of a new contract for foreign rice sales .
" I 'm surprised the Bush administration has n't slapped export controls on wheat , " Mr. Rawles said .
" The Asian countries are here buying every kind of wheat . "
Mr. Rawles said it is hard to know how much of the shortages are due to lagging supply and how much is caused by consumers hedging against future price hikes or a total lack of product .
" There have been so many stories about worldwide shortages that it encourages people to stock up .
What most people do n't realize is that supply chains have changed , so inventories are very short , " Mr. Rawles , a former Army intelligence officer , said .
" Even if people increased their purchasing by 20 % , all the store shelves would be wiped out . "
At the moment , large chain retailers seem more prone to shortages and limits than do smaller chains and mom-and - pop stores , perhaps because store managers at the larger companies have less discretion to increase prices locally .
Mr. Rawles said the spot shortages seemed to be most frequent in the Northeast and all the way along the West Coast .
He said he had heard reports of buying limits at Sam's Club warehouses , which are owned by Wal - Mart Stores , but a spokesman for the company , Kory Lundberg , said he was not aware of any shortages or limits .
An anonymous high - tech professional writing on an investment Web site , Seeking Alpha , said he recently bought 10 50 - pound bags of rice at Costco .
" I am concerned that when the news of rice shortage spreads , there will be panic buying and the shelves will be empty in no time .
I do not intend to cause a panic , and I am not speculating on rice to make profit .
I am just hoarding some for my own consumption , " he wrote .
For now , rice is available at Asian markets in California , though consumers have fewer choices when buying the largest bags .
" At our neighborhood store , it 's very expensive , more than $ 30 " for a 25 - pound bag , a housewife from Mountain View , Theresa Esquerra , said .
" I 'm not going to pay $ 30 .
Maybe we 'll just eat bread . "

Three different views of Saturn 's largest moon
If worlds have shadow twins elsewhere in the Universe , then Earth 's would appear to lie just a block or two down the cosmic road , in orbit around Saturn .
" We have on Titan many of the geological features that we find on Earth , " enthuses Rosaly Lopes .
" We find volcanism , we find tectonics , we find erosion and deposition , and wind activity forming dunes .
" It 's very similar to the Earth . "
But there is a crucial difference : Titan is so cold that most of the water is solid .
This combination of liquid water in the interior plus complex organic molecules composes two big ingredients for life
Ralph Lorenz , Johns Hopkins University
The rivers flowing across these plains are formed of a hydrocarbon soup with methane as its main ingredient .
The true nature of this once mysterious world is now finally emerging , courtesy largely of the Cassini - Huygens mission , a joint US - European venture , which deposited a landing craft on Titan , and continues to send back data and pictures of Saturn , its rings and its 60 - odd moons .
Dr Lopes , from Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in California , is one of the scientists reviewing the Titan findings at the European Geosciences Union ( EGU ) meeting in Vienna , Europe 's largest annual gathering of scientists studying the Earth , its climate and its cosmic neighbourhood .
Four years after its arrival in the Saturnian system , Cassini is now showing researchers just how similar Titan is to our own planet .
Lake district
Last year , the craft 's radar identified large areas close to the moon 's north pole that are apparently lakes filled with the same methane - rich liquid .
A few have subsequently turned up near the south pole , too .
The radar instrument has identified lakes on Titan 's surface " What you have is very much like the hydrological cycle on Earth , " explains Sushil Atreya from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor .
" We have methane lakes in the high latitude regions , and the lower part of the atmosphere is sub-saturated , so there 's about 40 % relative humidity [ of methane ] .
" And from time to time , it will rain methane onto the surface , which then collects into lakes ; and there are also equatorial storms in the tropical regions . "
So alike do the lakes appear to those on Earth that the cosmological " nomenclature police " , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) , have decreed that they can be named after those on our planet .
Among others , Titan now features a Lake Abeya , a Lake Mackay and a Lake Ontario , named because their shapes resemble their terrestrial equivalents in Ethiopia , Australia and Canada .
Long trails
Perhaps the most spectacular example of Titan 's mimicry of our terrestrial home lies in the river valleys , which are disturbingly Earth - like - long snaking structures with tributaries arranged like veins on a leaf .
Look at the images really hard , and you can almost imagine zooming in to find some Titanian vegetation growing along the banks , and a train of methane - guzzling animals heading down to drink .
" There are a lot of valley systems , and a few are very huge , in the order of 1,000 km long , " notes Ralf Jaumann from the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) .
Cassini has seen many valley systems on Titan 's surface
" We tried to figure out what these systems are doing with erosion on the surface , and it 's comparable with what we know on Earth ; these rivers are doing erosion and sediment transport just as we know it from rivers like the Rhine , Elbe and probably the Mississippi .
But the liquid in these rivers is not water , but methane . "
Ask why methane plays the role here that water plays on Earth , and the answer is disturbingly simple : it is chance .
On Earth , water is warm enough that water is mobile , but not so warm that it evaporates into space , as would happen on Mercury .
Titan is so cold - averaging about minus 180C - that water is largely frozen .
Here , it is methane that is able to flow , to evaporate , freeze , thaw and condense , without trailing away into the void .
Water bed
So if methane has usurped the role that water plays on Earth , what part is there on Titan for Earth 's most important substance ?
For the most part , water here is solid , behaving in some ways as rock does on Earth ; a surface to be eroded , a landscape to be sculpted .
But in places it emerges violently in volcanoes .
A new analysis of the moon 's rotation using Cassini 's radar data indicates that large quantities of liquid water may lie under the icy surface .
The Huygens probe captured images of Titan 's surface features as it parachuted through the atmosphere
Enlarge Image
" By matching up surface features that we saw on successive flybys , we were able to plot their positions relative to where we would have expected them to be if Titan was rotating the way it had always been expected to , " explains Ralph Lorenz from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , US .
" In fact , on top of the expected rotation there is a little bit of a wobble back and forth that is driven by the atmosphere spinning up and spinning down with the seasons .
" Now this actually happens on Earth ; the length of our day changes by about a millisecond over the course of a year .
But on Titan the change is considerably more because the atmosphere is denser than ours , and Titan is a smaller body .
" The displacement of surface features that we observe is such as to require the ice crust of Titan to be comparatively thin , perhaps 100 or 200 km thick , and decoupled from the core with an ocean of liquid water . "
Mission life
The atmosphere of Titan has also turned out to be reminiscent of Earth 's , possessing layers that mimic the troposphere , stratosphere and ionosphere above our heads .
There may be 1,000 times as much hydrocarbon as there is on Earth
In the higher levels , the interaction of solar radiation , nitrogen , and methane and other simple organic compounds leads to the formation of complex organic molecules such as benzene that later come down to the surface .
There may be 1,000 times more liquid hydrocarbons in Titan 's lakes than in all the oil wells on Earth .
Its dunes may hold hundreds of times the content of Earth 's coal reserves .
It makes an enticing prospect for the would - be life - hunter in space .
" This combination of liquid water in the interior plus complex organic molecules composes two big ingredients for life - certainly life as we know it - and that makes Titan a very attractive body for future exploration , " says Ralph Lorenz .
But Cassini is a busy craft .
Its trajectory means it spends most of its time away from Titan , snapping strip - shaped radar images as it swings by the moon approximately once every month .
An ocean of liquid water may exist below Titan 's surface
The first next step that scientists had been looking for was a two - year extension to Cassini 's mission schedule , taking it past the original end date of July this year .
As scientists were discussing the findings in Austria , Nasa officials back in Washington granted their wish .
In those two years , further flybys of Titan will mean that about 44 % of the moon 's surface gets mapped , as compared to 28 % currently .
A further extension mission is also feasible , provided that Cassini continues to enjoy a healthy old age .
Beyond that , something dedicated to Titan is envisaged ; or perhaps a " double - dip " mission taking in Titan and another of Saturn 's enticing moons , Enceladus .
Balloons and further landers may be deployed to sample Titan 's extravagant hydrocarbon riches .
Let us hope that the craft does not navigate by vision alone .
If it does , it is as likely to alight in the lake - strewn landscape of Finland or the valley of the Mississippi as on the plains of this strange and fascinating world .

" BioShock " , which captivated video game fans with its tale of an underwater utopia gone wrong , took the top honour from the Game Critics Awards on Thursday with judges praising it for innovating game play .
REUTERS / Handout
Released last August for Microsoft ’s Xbox 360 console , “ BioShock ” was a sleeper hit for Take - Two Interactive Software and critics gushed over its finely crafted story and disturbing moral choices .
“ ‘ BioShock ’ truly shocked , amazed and pushed all sorts of boundaries for gaming .
And while we felt it was 2007 ’s best title , we ’re betting its influence will extend well beyond 2007 , ” Dan Hsu , editor - in - chief of EGM magazine , wrote of the group ’s decision .
It was the first time the Game Critics Awards have picked a game of the year .
The group , consisting of several dozen game journalists , is best known for judging games shown at E3 , the game industry ’s most influential trade show .
The runner - up was “ The Orange Box ” from privately held studio Valve , co-published by Electronic Arts Inc .

Never Too Young to Marry , Sect Girls Say Texas official testifies girls said teen marriages and pregnancies were OK .
SAN ANGELO , Texas , April 18 , 2008  --
A child protection supervisor testified Thursday that girls at a West Texas polygamous ranch believed that teen marriages were OK and that girls from the compound had gotten pregnant when they were as young as 13 .
The girls believed there was " no age too young to be married and they wanted to have as many babies as they could , " said Angie Voss , a supervisor of investigations at the Texas Department of Child Protective Services .
Voss testified during a massive hearing in one of the largest child protection cases in U.S. history , an ad hoc , unwieldy process that will eventually determine the fate of 416 children taken from the Yearning for Zion Ranch .
The hearing will resume today .
Thurdays ' hearing , filled to capacity with more than 350 lawyers for the state , the children and their parents , dragged on into the night after a sputtering start .
At times , it seemed the process threatened to fall into chaos as lawyers jumped from their seats to object and Judge Barbara Walther struggled to maintain order .
" It 's a real monumental task -- the judge is essentially flying by the seat of her pants , " said Eric Robertson , who represents a 2 - year - old currently being housed in the San Angelo Coliseum .
Voss said it would not be safe to send the children -- including the boys -- back to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints compound because the culture there encourages marrying underage girls to older men in " spiritual marriages . "
" I believe the boys are groomed to be perpetrators , " she said .
Children on the Yearning for Zion Ranch also told a Texas state worker that they had seen the 16 - year - old girl who reportedly called a domestic abuse hot line saying that she was beaten and sexually abused by her 49 - year - old husband , spurring an investigation of child abuse on the polygamous compound , officials testified Thursday .
The children confirmed that she did have a baby but said that they did not know where she was , Voss said on the stand Thursday afternoon .
" It was a very scary environment , intimidating , " said Voss , who visited the ranch the night of April 3 .
" I was afraid . "
" I saw men all around , " Voss said .
" It felt like the schoolhouse was surrounded . "
Voss said that when she first arrived at the ranch and asked to see the girl who made the reported phone call , the men at the gates denied anyone of her description existed .
Eventually , they were allowed inside and taken to the schoolhouse , where they asked to meet with all girls who were younger than 18 .
A few of the girls who spoke with CPS investigators said that they had seen the teen the CPS workers were looking for within the previous week , Voss testified .
They confirmed that she did have a baby but said that they did not know where she was .
The massive custody case of 416 children taken from a polygamist sect opened Thursday to a chorus of complaints and motions that indicate it will take a long time to sort out the children 's future .
Among all the men dressed in suits in the San Angelo courtroom were about a dozen mothers from the sect dressed in their distinctive pioneer style ankle length dresses and a handful of men from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
During the first 40 minutes of the hearing , Walther was confronted with the enormity of the case — the largest child custody case in the nation 's history — and the difficulty in keeping order in such a complicated proceeding .
Lawyers repeatedly rose from the section where the public generally sits to make objections to the process that was just beginning , and Walther would tell them to sit down .
At one point a lawyer who said she represented an 8 - year - old girl objected , protesting that each child was entitled to an individual hearing and to be able to present evidence .
A clearly frustrated Walther assured the roomful of lawyers they would be able present evidence .
" Give us a chance to get this going .
Let 's just try to start this process before you say its not going to work , " she snapped .
The judge will eventually have to decide whether each child gets an individual hearing .
" It 's embarrassing compared to how cases are usually handled , " said D'Ann Johnson , a lawyer who represents three of the mothers and works for the Texas Rio Grande Legal Aide .
" It 's very difficult for justice to be done in this structure . "
Robertson told ABCNEWS.com that he had spoken with a woman who claimed to be his client 's mother , but had no way to verify whether she was telling the truth .
The children were removed from the sect 's Yearning for Zion Ranch during a weeklong raid that began April 3 .
Rod Parker , a spokesperson for the sect , spoke about the teen whose call prompted the raid .
" The information called in is easily checked out , " said Parker .
" We see no evidence of any effort to corroborate before the search . "
Nevertheless , officials say they have found teenagers under the age of 16 who are pregnant or who have babies , and that they fear that returning the children to the sect would put them and other children in danger of abuse .
To bolster that point , police Sgt. Danny Crawford , who took part in the search of the compound , said he found documents in a safe on the ranch that listed husbands and wives .
It included several adult men with wives who were 16 , Crawford testified .
Among the names he read from the list were Jackson Jessop , who had a wife listed as 17 and a son who was 8 months old .
Crawford also cited Abraham Jeffs , 35 , whose wife was listed as 16 years old .
Lawyers for Texas Child Protective Services asked the court today to require DNA tests of all the parents from the sect 's ranch so they could compare it to DNA of the children and establish parent and child relationships .
State officials have said it has been difficult to determine who are the parents of individual children .
CPS also requested that the judge order psychological evaluations for all of the sect 's parents , and that the judge allow the state to put the kids in foster care outside of the normal five - county range .
Most of the children are being housed in the San Angelo Coliseum , although 27 teenage boys have been sent 400 miles away to a facility for delinquent boys and girls .
The state said it wants to introduce medical records of three teenage girls as evidence .
But all lawyers were entitled to see the records and object if they want .
As they crammed the aisles to see the records , Walther called a recess .
When the hearing resumed , Walther said the initial objection to the medical records would be accepted and she asked the lawyers if they would be willing to hold their individual objections .
" Can I get a universal ' Yes , judge ' " ?
Walther asked .
The lawyers in the room answered together , " Yes , judge . "
The Tom Green County courthouse was ringed with police and there were so many lawyers and reporters for the case that the state set up a video of the hearing in a building a couple blocks away from the courthouse .
Also in the overflow room were several of the sect 's women who dabbed their eyes as they watched the proceeding .
Outside the courthouse , where satellite trucks lined the street , a man who said he was an FLDS father waved a photo of himself surrounded by his four children , ranging in age from an infant to about 9 .
" Look , look , look , " the father said .
" These children are all smiling , we 're happy . "

( CNN ) -- Gasoline prices set a record for the 16th consecutive day Wednesday .
A gallon of gas cost an average of $ 3.62 , according to AAA , and much more in some markets .
Shell Oil Co. President John Hofmeister says a boost in U.S. production would startle the world market .
All three presidential candidates have weighed in on the issue , and President Bush on Tuesday addressed it during a news conference .
John Hofmeister , president of Shell Oil Co. , the U.S. division of Royal Dutch Shell , addressed rising gasoline prices during an interview Wednesday with John Roberts on CNN's " American Morning . "
ROBERTS :
What do you say to people who are in this budget crunch of trying to fill up the family car ?
HOFMEISTER : I say we need more gas to be produced in this country .
I 've been saying that for three years , ever since I took this position [ as president of Shell ] .
If the U.S. set a goal to produce 2 to 3 million barrels more a day in this country , we would send a shock around the world that would immediately say to the speculators , hey , U.S. is serious .
President [ Bush ] said something yesterday about this .
I did n't hear him , but I think that 's good news .
But we should set a specific target .
The presidential candidates should be out there on the postings saying let 's increase domestic production by 2 to 3 million barrels a day .
That would be something that would put money back into this country , jobs back into this country , and it would bring more supply toward the Americans who need it .
ROBERTS : The president is advocating more drilling on U.S. territory .
Is n't it true that globally we 're starting to reach a peak in production and that within maybe a decade or two oil production will begin to decrease ?
HOFMEISTER :
Well , I think there is some argument [ that ] with convenient , easy oil we will peak sometime in the next decade .
I think Shell sees that coming , but in terms of total oil supply to the world , we 're a long way from reaching peak oil because it does n't take into account unconventional oil .
I think the president brings up a good point in that we could , we have the available domestic supplies off the coast of Alaska as well as [ the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge ] .
Shell has won $ 2 billion worth of high bids for the Chukchi Sea -- that 's a few years off before we could begin production .
But let 's remember there 's more than 100 billion barrels of untouched oil and gas in this country that is subject to a 30 - year moratorium .
Now , there 's only one body in this country that can set a 30 - year moratorium , and that 's the U.S. government .
ROBERTS : Sen .
Hillary Clinton wants to slap you with a 50 percent tax on what she calls windfall profit , profit above a certain level .
Is that a good idea ?
HOFMEISTER : Look at our revenues and our income for the last quarter .
If we had made $ 7.8 million on $ 114 million of revenue , nobody would call that excessive , because that 's 7 ½ percent .
We made $ 7.8 billion profit on $ 114 billion revenue -- same 7 ½ percent .
So to me that is not an excessive number when banks and pharmaceuticals and IT companies earn a whole lot more .
Watch Hofmeister defend Shell 's profits »
ROBERTS : Would it hurt you if she put in place this tax on the windfall profits ?
HOFMEISTER : Sure it would .
It would slow down investment .
Taxing the oil companies was tried in the ' 80s .
It drove us to do imports , which is exactly the problem we have today .
ROBERTS :
Where is the top of all this ?
How high can the price of a barrel of oil go ?
How high will the cost of a gallon of gasoline go ?
HOFMEISTER : I heard somebody say the other day it 's as long as a piece of string .
We do n't know .
ROBERTS : The president of OPEC said $ 200 a barrel .
HOFMEISTER : Yeah , well , there are some countries out there subsidizing the cost of their energy to their consumers and industries to compete with America -- or against America -- because they think America wo n't solve the problem .
ROBERTS :
You 're saying you have no idea where the top is .
HOFMEISTER : We do n't know .
But we should produce more oil in this country .

Clinton : OPEC 'can no longer be a cartel '
Clinton 's attacks on oil prices as artificially inflated , Enron - style , keep escalating , and today she appeared to threaten to break up the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries .
" We ’re going to go right at OPEC , " she said .
" They can no longer be a cartel , a monopoly that get together once every couple of months in some conference room in some plush place in the world , they decide how much oil they ’re going to produce and what price they ’re going to put it at , " she told a crowd at a firehouse in Merrillville , IN .
" That ’s not a market .
That ’s a monopoly , " she said , saying she 'd use anti-trust law and the World Trade Organization to take on OPEC .
Clinton has cast herself as a warrior for working people against the oil industry and malicious " speculators , " and made that -- along with her push for a gas tax holiday -- central to her closing message in Indiana .
It 's a potent message , like the attack on " Wall Street money brokers , " with deep roots in American politics .
It '
It 's also very hard to figure out what exactly she means by the threat to break OPEC .
UPDATE : The Obama campaign points out that Clinton has not signed on to cosponsor a bill that aspires " to make oil - producing and exporting cartels illegal . "
UPDATE : Clinton 's campaign says she voted a version of the bill in 2007 and has long favored filing a WTO complaint against OPEC .

A stunt driver has crashed the car used by movie secret agent James Bond into Italy 's Lake Garda during filming of 007's latest movie , Quantum of Solace .
The driver was delivering the iconic Aston Martin DBS to the film scene in heavy rain when he lost control around one of the lake 's narrow curves .
The driver was quickly rescued and taken to hospital with minor injuries .
Italian TV showed the car , reportedly the only one available for use in the film , being winched out of the lake .
Filming for the movie - starring Daniel Craig as the latest Bond - has already taken the crew to England , Panama , Chile and Mexico .
The newest film in the long - running 007 franchise is to be released later this year .

Day is coming up and you want to be prepared for the event .
What can you do to …
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- A Georgia military contractor tricked law enforcement agencies into buying faulty stun grenades , ultimately leaving three FBI agents injured , federal prosecutors announced Monday .
" Flash - bang " grenades were relabeled and sold to police after the Navy deemed them faulty , an indictment says .
Pyrotechnic Specialties Inc. is accused of relabeling and selling " flash - bang " grenades that the U.S. military rejected after its personnel were injured .
The company also mixed defective grenades with others that had been fixed " to camouflage the defective devices from receiving personnel " at the FBI , the indictment says .
Last week 's indictment alleges that company officials bribed a federal official and paid for a visit to a strip club .
The officials are accused of conspiracy , money laundering , mail fraud and defrauding the government .
Watch how the grenades work »
The company , known as PSI , did not immediately respond to calls for comment .
The indictment names three company officials -- CEO David J. Karlson , sales representative F. Brad Swann and production manager Daniel Ramone -- as taking part in the conspiracy .
The indictment does not say whether they still hold those titles .
PSI had a multimillion - dollar contract with the Defense Department to provide stun or " flash - bang " grenades , referred to as " MK141 diversionary charges " in the indictment .
From 1996 to 2007 , the Navy awarded three contracts to PSI for the MK141 , according to the indictment .
The devices are designed to produce a bright flash and loud bang , disorienting their targets .
They 're considered nonlethal weapons , though they can be dangerous .
The indictment alleges , " On or about March 2003 , a flaw in the original Navy design of the MK141 diversionary charge became apparent . "
A plastic piece would sometimes crack , which " could result in a hazardous situation to those in close proximity . "
" Improper detonation could , and did , cause serious injuries to personnel using the device , " according to the indictment .
The indictment says that the Department of Defense issued a " stop work order " on the devices , and PSI " developed a procedure to correct the defect " that cost about $ 3.72 per unit .
PSI officials later engaged in a scheme to sell the defective devices by claiming that they had met the department 's standards , the indictment alleges .
The defendants sold and attempted to sell the devices " to the Department of Defense and to federal law enforcement agencies , as well as to state and local law enforcement agencies , " the indictment says .
At one point , some of them prematurely detonated , " causing serious injuries " to three FBI agents who were on a SWAT team investigating a kidnapping , the indictment says , adding that the interior of their government vehicle was damaged .
" To further implement the scheme and artifice to defraud , the defendants provided gratuities and additional compensation to a Department of Defense employee , " the indictment adds .
The devices were sold to more than a dozen FBI offices between 2003 and 2004 , as well as to the San Rafael Police Department in San Rafael , California , and the Orange County Sheriff / Coroner 's Department in Santa Ana , California , the indictment says .
The Department of Defense said it could not comment because the case is under investigation .
" Our understanding is that the Naval Criminal Investigative Service is supporting the FBI in this investigation , " Lt. Geraldine Carey of Marine Corps Systems Command said in a written statement .
Carey added that it is " against DOD policy to discuss matters under investigation prior to the requested official or government agency receiving a formal report . "
According to the company 's Web site , PSI supports " the U.S. and many foreign military services with custom compositions , pellets and devices . "
Automotive airbag products are atop the list of commercial products it manufactures , according to the Web site .
The company employs 160 people at its manufacturing facility near Byron , Georgia , the Web site says .

Does the USA Need a Debt Consolidation Loan ?
By now you are well aware of the debt crisis the United States of America is facing .
Turn on the news and you will hear about how we are in a recession .
The most extreme of financial “ experts ” will tell you we are headed towards another Great Depression .
You obviously have felt the effects of this debt , but what has been causing it ?
No Credit , No Problem !
We know the cause , at some point in time lending standards started to deteriorate until they bottomed out just recently .
With the “ no credit , no problem ! ” slogan becoming ever so popular , even people with the poorest of credit ratings were able to get a loan .
The fundamental problem with this is that these people will have less money to pay off the much higher interest on their loans , which will lead to a default .
This has helped cause our current debt problem .
Bad credit loans have quickly become bad loans .
Overzealous lenders saw a niche market that they could make money off of and threw caution into the wind , and it came back to haunt them and us .
This has affected numerous industries .
The housing market has already crashed , and foreclosures are on the rise .
Credit card debt is heading the same route .
With the collapse of JP Morgan - Bear Stearns , a prominent investment bank , a new trend has started to rise : government bailouts .
The US government issued a $ 30 billion dollar bailout of Bear Stearns , and more bailouts could be on the way .
Both democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama support pumping an additional $ 30 billion dollars into the economy to assist the housing market and other economic stimulus plans .
Just recently , Congress issued a $ 152 billion dollar economic stimulus package .
The FDIC , Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , was established after the Great Depression to ensure people ’s bank accounts to up to $ 100,000 .
If the debt crisis gets even worse , it is possible banks could start to fail and the FDIC would be on the hook for billions upon billions of dollars .
The Cost of War
The War in Iraq has become less and less popular , as many site the loss of American lives as the main reason to pull out .
The cost of American dollars , however , may be another important reason to pull out .
It is estimated that the war costs the United States about $ 300 million per day , and as of today the total cost is over $ 500 billion dollars .
Estimation is that the war costs each individual citizen about $ 1,721 .
Time to Consolidate ?
Let ’s tally up the totals : Government bailouts , costs of war , the Bush $ 600 tax refund plan , and the national debt now sits at over $ 9 trillion .
The national debt has never been higher , after reaching some of its lowest totals during the Clinton administration in the 90s .
It seems the United States is in danger of collapsing in debt one day ; perhaps a debt consolidation loan is in order .
With a debt consolidation loan , the United States could combine all their debts into one , easy monthly payment .
The real question is : who has enough money to take on the United States enormous debt ?
The answer could be China , but that is not really an answer at all is it ?

On May 23 , 1933 , Congressman , Louis T. McFadden , brought formal charges against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank system , The Comptroller of the Currency and the Secretary of United States Treasury for numerous criminal acts , including but not limited to , CONSPIRACY , FRAUD , UNLAWFUL CONVERSION , AND TREASON .
The petition for Articles of Impeachment was thereafter referred to the Judiciary Committee and has YET TO BE ACTED ON .
So , this ELECTRONIC BOOKLET should be reprinted , reposted , set up on web pages and circulated far and wide .
Congressman McFadden on the Federal Reserve Corporation Remarks in Congress , 1934 AN ASTOUNDING EXPOSURE
Congressman McFadden ’s Speech On the Federal Reserve Corporation
Quotations from several speeches made on the Floor of the House of Representatives by the Honorable Louis T. McFadden of Pennsylvania .
Mr. McFadden , due to his having served as Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee for more than 10 years , was the best posted man on these matters in America and was in a position to speak with authority of the vast ramifications of this gigantic private credit monopoly .
As Representative of a State which was among the first to declare its freedom from foreign money tyrants it is fitting that Pennsylvania , the cradle of liberty , be again given the credit for producing a son that was not afraid to hurl defiance in the face of the money - bund .
Whereas Mr. McFadden was elected to the high office on both the Democratic and Republican tickets , there can be no accusation of partisanship lodged against him .
Because these speeches are set out in full in the Congressional Record , they carry weight that no amount of condemnation on the part of private individuals could hope to carry .
The Federal Reserve - A Corrupt Institution
" Mr. Chairman , we have in this Country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known .
I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks , hereinafter called the Fed .
The Fed has cheated the Government of these United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the Nation ’s debt .
The depredations and iniquities of the Fed has cost enough money to pay the National debt several times over .
" This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of these United States , has bankrupted itself , and has practically bankrupted our Government .
It has done this through the defects of the law under which it operates , through the maladministration of that law by the Fed and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it .
" Some people who think that the Federal Reserve Banks United States Government institutions .
They are private monopolies which prey upon the people of these United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers ; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers ; and rich and predatory money lender .
In that dark crew of financial pirates there are those who would cut a man ’s throat to get a dollar out of his pocket ; there are those who send money into states to buy votes to control our legislatures ; there are those who maintain International propaganda for the purpose of deceiving us into granting of new concessions which will permit them to cover up their past misdeeds and set again in motion their gigantic train of crime .
" These twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully and disloyally foisted upon this Country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our American institutions .
Those bankers took money out of this Country to finance Japan in a war against Russia .
They created a reign of terror in Russia with our money in order to help that war along .
They instigated the separate peace between Germany and Russia , and thus drove a wedge between the allies in World War .
They financed Trotsky ’s passage from New York to Russia so that he might assist in the destruction of the Russian Empire .
They fomented and instigated the Russian Revolution , and placed a large fund of American dollars at Trotsky ’s disposal in one of their branch banks in Sweden so that through him Russian homes might be thoroughly broken up and Russian children flung far and wide from their natural protectors .
They have since begun breaking up of American homes and the dispersal of American children .
" Mr. Chairman , there should be no partisanship in matters concerning banking and currency affairs in this Country , and I do not speak with any .
" In 1912 the National Monetary Association , under the chairmanship of the late Senator Nelson W. Aldrich , made a report and presented a vicious bill called the National Reserve Association bill .
This bill is usually spoken of as the Aldrich bill .
Senator Aldrich did not write the Aldrich bill .
He was the tool , if not the accomplice , of the European bankers who for nearly twenty years had been scheming to set up a central bank in this Country and who in 1912 has spent and were continuing to spend vast sums of money to accomplish their purpose .
" We were opposed to the Aldrich plan for a central bank .
The men who rule the Democratic Party then promised the people that if they were returned to power there would be no central bank established here while they held the reigns of government .
Thirteen months later that promise was broken , and the Wilson administration , under the tutelage of those sinister Wall Street figures who stood behind Colonel House , established here in our free Country the worm - eaten monarchical institution of the " King ’s Bank " to control us from the top downward , and from the cradle to the grave .
" The Federal Reserve Bank destroyed our old and characteristic way of doing business .
It discriminated against our 1 - name commercial paper , the finest in the world , and it set up the antiquated 2 - name paper , which is the present curse of this Country and which wrecked every country which has ever given it scope ; it fastened down upon the Country the very tyranny from which the framers of the Constitution sough to save us .

In an e-mail message to Mr. Sesto , Rackspace ’s senior corporate counsel , Beth Sherfy , said the company would not be the site ’s host because it “ could create a risk to the health and safety of law enforcement officers . ”
RateMyCop then found a third domain host , which Mr. Sesto would not identify , and is back online .
Six months ago , Mr. Sesto and the site ’s other founder , Rebecca Costell , began sending letters to thousands of police and sheriff ’s departments around the country requesting the names and badge numbers of officers .
Based on the responses and information on department Web sites , they created a database of officers from more than 500 departments in every state except Maine , Rhode Island and Alabama .
The site focuses on departments in major cities , including Los Angeles , San Francisco , Dallas , Atlanta and Miami .
Sgt. James Russo of the New York Police Department ’s freedom of information law unit said the department would decide by the end of the month whether to send the Web site the requested information on its officers .
Washington , D.C. , and Chicago have turned down RateMyCop ’s request .
Users can search for officers by name , department or state and give them up to five stars based on professionalism , fairness and overall satisfaction during an encounter .
Users must register with the site by leaving their names and e-mail addresses before rating or commenting on officers and are urged to flag inappropriate postings .
Some comments have been removed after users complained that they were worrisome or offensive , according to Mr. Sesto .
“ We want a safe environment , ” he said .
Mr. Sesto said he had decided to create the site after trading stories about traffic tickets with a friend last year .
“ There are sites like rate my doctor , rate my lawyer , rate my teacher , so why not have rate my cop ? ” he said .
“ We are taxpayers .
We pay for the service that ’s provided , so why ca n’t we give feedback on that service ? ”
The average rating since Feb. 28 , the site ’s first day online , has been 3.7 stars .
Many users gave high marks and thanked officers for being helpful or professional .
Among raters who were not as impressed was “ imdlaw1 ” who gave two stars to a San Diego sheriff ’s deputy and described him as “ a little red - head napoleon . ”
“ Tate ” described his encounter with a Dallas police officer with one word : “ Lies . ”

My " COP STOP " idea for a painting spawned out of this tin police car .
It 's cool graphics made it perfect for the focal point of a police - related image .
I decided that the police car would ticket one of the local citizens for parking in a ' police parking only ' zone .
That zone would be ... in front of " The Donut Shop " .
I 've chosen a strip of buildings in Oceanside that I can ' convert ' into a donut shop .
The street light , awnings and ' high lighting ' will give the image plenty of life .
Well , no painting about the police is worth it 's weight in paint if you do n't have a police officer , and in this case I did n't have to look too far to find a ' suspect ' for my model .
This is my youngest brother , Brian who has been in law enforcement for as long as I can remember .
Although he is not a uniformed officer anymore , he came up with the perfect uniform to pose as my ' parking enforcer ' .
Stay tuned as I begin to put all the elements together ...
Here is a mockup from foam board , that helps me visualize what the donut shop should look like in terms of lighting and impact .
I 've blocked in a blue sky to simulate the sky against the donut sign .
It is obvious to me that the donut needs to be bigger and that the ' DONUTS ' letters need to be cut out and dimentional .
I decided to start the painting with the police officer writing the ticket .
I 've designed the signage for the store next door .
Here 's the car blocked in .
Notice that the driver of the car is not in the window .
The " Laszlo's Car Wash " promotion car is in place .
By the way , you push the ' spring loaded ' head of the driver down and the rear wheels spin ... very cool .
Here is a view of the two cars on the street .
I 'm painting the cars first because they have to be these specific colors .
I will base the rest of the painting 's color on these two objects .
The street and shadows are painted next to ' tie down ' the cars and officer to the ground ...
Here is an overall photo of the painting .
There is quite a bit of glare from the overhead lights so I will reshoot later .
The two stores are taking shape .
Notice the scrubbing effect the first application of paint makes in the window areas .
That will diminish in the final paint layer .
All the preliminary painting is done .
Now , I will make the final decisions on values ( lightness / darkness ) and hues ( color ) of each area of the painting .
The paint applied on this ' second coat ' will be mixed straight out of the tube with no thinners or medium ( ie. linseed oil , stand oil etc. ) .
The background buildings are completed .
The large donut and the sky will be next .
Here are the same buildings with the sky painted with a slightly darker value , which makes the buildings ' pop ' in the sunlight .
And the donut ... plain , no icing ... ready for dunking !
Today I painted the building it 's cream color , both the sunlit areas and the shaded areas .
Here 's an overall look at it .
Next I will paint the signage and awning , moving down into the window areas after that .
For those of you who have emailed me and asked for a peek into my studio , here is a shot of my back wall in my painting area .
Lots of props that have either been in a painting or are waiting their turn ...
Here 's a close - up of the finished street lamps .
Look at the finished DONUT sign on the overhang .
I love the powder blue color ... It looks as edible as the donut !
I 've painted the windows and doors on the shoe repair store much darker to make the police car stand out .
The windows of the donut shop are also darker to make the little tin man in the Car Wash car ' pop ' optically .
The awning was painted , increasing the ' redness ' of the hue .
Compare the finished ' Car Wash ' car with the photo of it in it 's initial stage two photos above .
Notice the increased intensity in the hue and detail .
Patrol car is done .
The only things left are Brian ( the cop ) , the sidewalk and the street .
Brian looks good .
The street and the sidewalk have been painted also ...
That 's it !
Finished !
A donut sounds good right about now !
Law enforcement officials assist members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints onto a school bus in Eldorado , Texas , Sunday , April 6 , 2008 .
Officials in Texas just finished collecting cheek - swab samples from the 437 children and alleged parents in order to determine who is related to whom .
The children were removed from a polygamous commune in Eldorado earlier this month during a raid sparked by reports of sexual abuse of underage girls .
According to news accounts of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) in Eldorado , pubescent girls were forced into " spiritual marriages " to older men .
The cheek - tissue samples will be analyzed for DNA , the tightly coiled threads of deoxyribonucleic acid found inside each of the trillions of cells in our bodies .
Sexual consent
Results could have legal implications , including any evidence for possible statutory rape , which includes individuals below a certain age deemed legally incapable of consenting to sexual activity .
In Texas , 17 is the minimum age , making it illegal for anyone under the age of 17 to engage in sexual activity with another who is at least three years their elder .
( An individual must be at least 16 years old to enter into a legal marriage in Texas . )
" Now not only can we look at alleged relationships between parents and their children , " said Robert Allen , a professor of biochemistry at Oklahoma State University , " but now we can look at alleged sibships ( siblings ) , alleged half - sibships ( half brothers and sisters ) . "
To find a male child 's father , researchers will look for match - ups in DNA markers found on the Y sex chromosome , which is passed down from fathers to their sons .
" All males descended from a common male and female ancestor would have exactly the same Y chromosome passed unchanged from generation to generation , " said Allen , who is also director of the Human Identity Testing Laboratory .
" So I will have the same Y chromosome as my brother , father , son , paternal uncle , paternal cousin . "
Mothers can be linked to children with DNA found in the cells ' energy - producing structures called mitochondria .
The mitochondria hold a separate set of genes passed down from mothers to their offspring .
Based on the age of the child , officials could then figure out how old the mother was at the time of conception and the age of the father .
The information will be news only to officials , as the mothers and children within this Mormon sect know who 's who .
" It 's not a free - love community .
These children are being raised by their mothers .
It 's the father who may be having multiple wives .
All these children know who their father is and who their mother is , " said Stuart Wright , a professor of sociology at Lamar University in Texas .
" The question is whether some of these women were under legal age when they were either married or impregnated .
I think that 's what the DNA tests are probably going to try to show . "
Incestual relations ?
The DNA testing could also provide incest clues .
Though no evidence of incest has been reported in the current case , the Texas Department of Public Safety ( DPS ) is conducting the criminal investigation of possible sexual abuse at the Eldorado compound , also called the Yearning for Zion ( YFZ ) ranch .
" We assisted Child Protective Services in serving a search warrant at the YFZ ranch .
While we were there , we observed activity that led us to believe that there may be some crimes that were occurring , " said Tela Mange , a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety .
" We obtained a second search warrant .
And we are in the process of conducting a criminal investigation . "
The investigation does include looking into possible " sexual abuse , " Mange told LiveScience .
" We have n't been more specific than that at this point . "
However , incidents of statutory rape and incest have surfaced in other investigations of members of this sect .
The sect 's " prophet " Warren Jeffs was convicted in Utah last year of being an accomplice to rape , for arranging a marriage between a 14 - year - old girl and her first cousin ; in Arizona , Jeffs faces trial on eight charges of sexual conduct with a minor , incest and conspiracy , according to news accounts .
Jeffs is now being held in the Mohave County Jail in Kingman , Arizona , where he will be tried on charges of being an accomplice to incest and sex with minors .
" In incest , for example , you can determine whether or not a man is the father of the mother just by doing the standard parentage analysis . "
Allen said .
" Then you can determine if the man is also the father of her child . "
A strong positive test would suggest the man mated with his own daughter , Allen added .
Incest is a statutory crime , and is defined as sexual intercourse between close blood - relatives .
The prohibited degrees of incest vary from state to state and can include brothers and sisters , parents and children , aunts or uncles with nephews or nieces , and grandparents and grandchildren .
In Texas , it is illegal for a person to have sexual relations with : a current or former stepchild or stepparent , an uncle or aunt ( or half uncle or half aunt ) , or a brother or sister ( or half brother or half sister ) , according to the Texas Attorney General 's office .
MITROVICA , Kosovo ( Reuters ) - NATO troops secured a hostile strip of north Kosovo on Tuesday after Serb riots forced the pullout of U.N. personnel in the most serious challenge to the state since it split from Serbia last month .
Soldiers in infantry vehicles and armored personnel carriers were positioned at key points in the flashpoint town of Mitrovica , where Serbs bitterly opposed to Kosovo ’s independence clashed with U.N. police and NATO peacekeepers on Monday .
Bridges over the Ibar river that divides the Serb north from the Albanian south were closed .
The U.N. mission that has run Kosovo since the 1998 - 99 war said the withdrawal of its police and civilian staff from the Serb stronghold of north Mitrovica was only temporary , but could not say when they would return .
Monday ’s clashes highlighted the risk of Kosovo ’s partition along ethnic lines and cast further doubt on the deployment in the north of a European Union police mission intended to take over much of the role of the U.N. administration in Kosovo .
“ We will maintain our intention to deploy the mission throughout the territory of Kosovo , ” the EU ’s new Kosovo envoy , Pieter Feith , told a news conference .
The violence , sparked by a U.N. police operation to retake a U.N. court seized three days earlier by protesting Serbs , was the worst since Kosovo ’s 90 - percent Albanian majority declared independence from Serbia on Feb 17 .
GUNFIRE
NATO said its troops came under automatic gunfire as Serbs converged on the court following the dawn raid .
Serb media reports said about 70 civilians were wounded , along with dozens of U.N. police and soldiers of the 16,000 - strong NATO - led peacekeeping force .

The EU last month withdrew a small advance team from north Mitrovica for security reasons .
A U.N. spokesman said U.N. staff would return “ as soon as the security situation permits ” .
Backed by big - power ally Russia , Serbia has rejected Kosovo ’s secession and its recognition by the United States and a majority of the EU ’s 27 members .

Around 120,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo among 2 million ethnic Albanians .
Almost half live in the north , adjacent to Serbia and in complete isolation from the capital Pristina .
They reject the incoming EU mission as “ occupiers ” .
Russia on Monday demanded restraint by NATO and Serbia said it was consulting Moscow on joint steps to protect Kosovo Serbs .
Serbia lost control over Kosovo in 1999 , when NATO bombed to drive out Serb forces and halt the killing and ethnic cleansing of Albanians in a two - year Serb counter - insurgency war .
Belgrade is now strengthening a network of parallel structures in Serb areas of Kosovo , severing ties between Serbs and Albanians in all aspects of civic life .
“ We have to be present here as a state to provide security for Kosovo Serbs , ” Serbia ’s Minister for Kosovo , Slobodan Samardzic , told Serbian state television late on Monday .
Addressing the crowd in Mitrovica , Samardzic said : “ Our battle continues .
Kosovo is part of Serbia . ”
The Department of Justice released a report Thursday that reviewed the FBI 's use of national security letters in 2006 and the steps the FBI has taken to correct problems identified in last year 's report on the use of NSLs .
The report acknowledged that the bureau had made some limited progress in reforming the NSL process , but warned that more changes were still needed .
A national security letter is a controversial legal device that allows the FBI to demand certain kinds of business records about Americans without judicial oversight .
They are typically delivered to telephone companies , Internet service providers , and financial institutions .
The letters have been in use since the 1980s , but their use was dramatically expanded by the Patriot Act in 2001 .
The Patriot Act allows the government to threaten recipients of the letters with criminal prosecution if they reveal to anyone that they have received the letters .
On a few occasions , this " gag order " provision has been successfully challenged in court , but ignoring a gag order still carries legal risks .
In his first report on NSLs , released in March 2007 , Inspector General Glenn Fine inspected a few hundred NSLs issued by the FBI between 2003 and 2005 and found dozens that had been issued " improperly . "
Given that a total of 143,000 NSLs were issued during that period , the results suggested that hundreds , and probably thousands , of improper NSLs were issued from 2003 to 2005 .
Last week 's report extended that analysis to 2006 .
The FBI issued more than 48,000 NSLs during 2006 .
The OIG found that NSL abuses continued in 2006 , and that " the FBI sought or obtained records or other information on thousands of telephone numbers outside the normal approval process , some of which were associated with improper NSLs , exigent letters , and other informal requests . "
It also warned that due to deficiencies in the FBI 's internal tracking system , reports to Congress have understated the use of NSLs by the FBI .
Last week 's report did not cover the use of " exigent letters , " the legally dubious practice of asking businesses to voluntarily turn over their customers ' private records before receiving a legally binding NSL .
Exigent letters will be the subject of a follow - up report to be released in the coming months .
" Significant progress "
The FBI has taken pains to emphasize that the 2006 abuses occurred before the release of the original OIG report a year ago .
In the last year , the FBI has taken steps to prevent further abuses .
The bureau has created an Office of Integrity and Compliance to ensure compliance with legal requirements regarding the use of NSLs .
It has issued new legal guidance for FBI agents to follow .
It has also instituted mandatory training sessions for FBI personnel .
The OIG report praised these steps as " significant progress " toward reducing the abuse of national security letters .
But it also found that the FBI needed to do much more to ensure that the abuses do not recur .
For example , in last year 's report , the inspector general recommended that the FBI implement a system to tag information derived from national security letters so they could be distinguished from data gathered using ordinary investigative activities .
That would assist FBI agents in ensuring that information ostensibly obtained for anti-terrorism or counter - espionage purposes is not used for ordinary criminal investigations .
But an FBI working group concluded that such tagging would be burdensome and would provide few privacy benefits .
Last week 's report disagreed , urging the FBI to " give additional consideration " to the issue .
The report faulted the FBI for assigning only 14 personnel to its Office of Integrity and Compliance .
At this staffing level , the report warned , the office " appears to serve as a coordinator rather than an entity with sufficient independent resources and a capability to identify and assess compliance risks . "
Inadequate staffing would mean that most oversight would consist of each department evaluating its own activities .
This danger is illustrated by the internal review of NSL usage that the FBI conducted in response to last year 's OIG report .
Fine found that the FBI 's internal auditors tended to " understate the severity " of problems with the use of NSLs by categorizing them as " administrative errors . "
These included hundreds of cases where inadequate record - keeping had made it impossible to determine whether the law had been followed .
The FBI 's audit was also far more likely to fault third parties for NSL problems than was Fine :
The FBI found that 1 percent of NSL requests had problems attributable to the actions of the FBI , while 8 percent had problems attributable to errors on the part of the NSL recipient .
In contrast , Fine 's audit found that 4 percent of NSLs had errors by FBI personnel , while only 3 percent had problems attributable to the recipient .
The importance of judicial oversight
These results suggest that procedural reforms within the FBI will never be sufficient to ensure that the law is followed .
FBI personnel will inevitably be biased in favor of their fellow FBI officials .
The creation of the FBI 's Office of Integrity and Compliance is especially ironic because the federal government already has an " integrity and compliance " unit .
It 's called the judicial branch .
Rather than trying to create a separate system of checks and balances within the FBI , the feds should take advantage of the system of checks and balances we already have .
Administrative reforms are no substitute for genuine judicial oversight .
Regardless of the number of layers of review , the sophistication of the FBI 's tracking system , or the amount of time its personnel spend in training , there will always be a temptation to cut corners unless the issuance of NSLs is subject to scrutiny from outside the FBI hierarchy .
We are only now learning about NSL abuses that occurred in 2006 .
This suggests that we wo n't learn about 2007 abuses until 2009 , and abuses happening today wo n't be revealed until 2010 .
After - the - fact investigations and procedural reforms are no substitute for case - by - case judicial oversight .
Once abuses have occurred , there is n't a lot that can be done about them .
Only by having a judge review each and every national security letter — before it 's issued — can we be confident that the abuses identified in recent OIG reports will not recur in the future .

Jesus ate bread and drank wine at the last supper
Don Colbert , a Florida doctor , believes asking yourself " What would Jesus eat ? " is the best way to stay fit , slim and trim .
In his book , which gets its title from this question , he explores some of the Old Testament dietary laws and looks at foods mentioned in the Bible .
He says : " If you truly want to follow Jesus in every area of your life you cannot ignore your eating habits .
Some of the stricter religious people have accused Jesus of being a wine bibber and a glutton because Jesus did like parties
Reverend Dr Gordon Gatward , Director of the Arthur Rank Centre
" The health of Americans is going down and it is largely down to our bad food choices .
" We have an obesity epidemic .
People eat when they are stressed and eat on the run and everyone is super - sizing their meals .
" A lot of people have no desire to change their foods .
Instead , they just go on medication to control their symptoms of obesity - related disease .
But it should n't be this way .
" By getting them to look at the biblical side it allows them to slow down and make the correct choice about their diet and lifestyle , " he said .
So what did Jesus eat ?
At the last supper , Jesus is said to have eaten bread and drunk wine .
Luke 24:42 says : " And they gave him [ Jesus ] a piece of a broiled fish , and of a honeycomb .
And he took it , and did eat before them . "
Round Lake Tiberias - the Sea of Galilee - fish would also have been significant
Eric Eve , a tutor in theology and a New Testament scholar at Oxford University
While Luke 10:8 says : " Whenever you enter a town and they receive you , eat what is set before you , " which would seem to suggest that Jesus was not encouraging fussiness about food .
Dr Colbert said : " Jesus ate primarily natural foods in their natural states - lots of vegetables , especially beans and lentils .
" He would have eaten wheat bread , a lot of fruit , drunk a lot of water and also red wine .
" And he would only eat meat on special occasions , maybe once a month , just like the parable of the prodigal son who ate fatted calf . "
Mediterranean diet
Eric Eve , a tutor in theology and a New Testament scholar at Oxford University , said : " The staple diet of a Mediterranean peasant in Jesus ' day would have been bread .
" Round Lake Tiberias - the Sea of Galilee - fish would also have been significant , though for peasants perhaps only in small quantities to provide a relish for the bread .
" Grapes and olives were also grown in Galilee , but more as cash crops for the wine and oil trade than for peasant consumption . "
He said food was probably scarce .
" Many of them probably went hungry much of the time , or achieved only bare subsistence . "
But he said : " I can't imagine many modern Americans taking enthusiastically to all the features of a " biblical " diet
Biblical dietary laws
Pork pie would not have graced Jesus ' dinner table
" For example Leviticus 11:22 says ' Of them you may eat : the locust according to its kind , the bald locust according to its kind , the cricket according to its kind , and the grasshopper according to its kind . ' "
Dr Colbert said : " He did not eat meats that were an abomination .
" He followed the Levitical laws .
He would not have eaten pigs and rabbits or fish that did not have scales , such as crabs and shrimps .
" These foods are higher in arachidonic acid , which is an inflammatory fatty acid , as well as saturated fat that predisposes us to disease .
" So , again , it is best if we eat these animals , which were forbidden in the Old Testament , only very rarely and in smaller amounts , I tell my patients . "
Gift from God
Dr Colbert said it was also the manner in which people ate in biblical times that was important .
" They would eat for hours and take their time .
The disciples would be lounging around and conversing while dining , not eating fast food on the go like we do . "
Reverend Dr Gordon Gatward , director of the Arthur Rank Centre , part of the Royal Agricultural Society of England , said : " Some of the stricter religious people have accused Jesus of being a wine bibber and a glutton because Jesus did like parties .
" But what is interesting is that with both Christian and Jewish faiths , the focal celebration and worship surrounds a meal .
We say grace before a meal because food is a gift from God .
" But it is about more than just the physical diet .
It is also about the spiritual diet .
The Christian faith takes a holistic view . "
In the wake of the near panic over the launch of Sputnik in 1957 , President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed James Killian , the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , to become the first special assistant to the president for science and technology .
Ever since , the relationship between the nation ’s chief executive and the White House ’s resident authority on nuclear fission , the workings of DNA and the greenhouse effect , among an array of topics , has had its highs and lows .
To be sure , advice has flowed freely at times .
Eisenhower consulted frequently with Killian and other scientists , and in the Kennedy years Jerome Wiesner , another M.I.T. president , helped to coordinate the government ’s response to the publication of Rachel Carson ’s Silent Spring , a book that spurred a national grassroots environmental movement by pointing out the dangers of pesticides .
Just as often the adviser ’s position has tilted toward irrelevance .
Richard M. Nixon went so far as to abolish the job altogether , along with the President ’s Science Advisory Committee , which had recommended against going ahead with a supersonic transport program , advice that the ill - fated 37th president did not want to hear .
( The U.S. Congress restored the position in 1976 . )
The tenure of George W. Bush marks a new nadir .
On the few science - related issues the administration has cared about — stem cells and climate change were on the short list — it had largely set its course before the arrival of its new science adviser John H. Marburger III some nine months after Bush first took office .
The administration , moreover , stripped the job of the title “ special assistant to the president , ” a reminder that the adviser would never be part of the inner circle .
Nevertheless , hopes rose with the appointment of the well - regarded physicist and former head of Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory .
“ As both scientist and administrator , John H. Marburger III tries to bring needed perspective into a White House not thought to be particularly interested in science , ” read a headline for a profile published in Scientific American in June 2002 .
In the ensuing years , Marburger has disappointed .
Much of his public persona has been as an apologist for the Bush team , trying to rebut charges from scientists , Congress and the media that the administration has engaged in a “ war on science ” by systematically distorting or suppressing science - related reports and politicizing federal advisory committees .
Bush ’s first appointed EPA administrator , former New Jersey Republican governor Christine Todd Whitman , resigned in 2003 , amid this politically charged atmosphere .
Mystifyingly , the ever dutiful Marburger , a registered Democrat , has spent more time as science adviser than any of the dozen or so men who have served before him .
Marburger continues to plow ahead with elaborate rationales that acknowledge in one breath the reality of global warming and in the next explain why “ adaptation ” to rising temperatures ( think pineapple farming in North Da­kota ) needs to receive more attention .
He has also assumed the role of the disembodied , neutral voice that quietly corrects the boss ’s gaffes .
Yes , evolution is the “ cornerstone of modern biology . ”
No , intelligent design is not a scientific concept ( comments he made the day after Bush twice said that both should be taught in schools ) .
We can only hope that the next president , whether Democrat or Republican , will not relegate the science adviser — and the entire scientific endeavor — to the status of afterthought .
Once elected , the new chief executive should hire a leading scientist , perhaps one with Marburger ’s credentials though not with his compliant , technocratic demeanor .
In collaboration with the rest of the community , the official should be allowed to assume a prominent , unimpeded role in helping to influence the crafting of policies that address climate change , missile defense and stem cells .
The war on cancer — and a host of other research initiatives — should once again take precedence over the war on science .

Lurita Doan finally forced out at GSA
Lurita Doan , head of the General Services Administration , was forced to offer her resignation tonight , according to an e-mail she sent out this evening .
Doan was appointed in late May , 2006 , becoming the first woman to serve as GSA Administrator .
With 12,000 empioyees and a $ 20 billion annual budget , GSA has responsibilty for overseeing the thousands of building and properties owned by the federal government .
Doan became the subject of congressional scrutiny last year for allegedly using GSA to help Republican lawmakers win re-election .
Doan denied the allegation , but her appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was disastrous .
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , chairman of the panel , called on Doan to resign over the allegations , but Doan refused to do so .
Here is the text of the e-mail that Doan sent out earlier this evening announcing her forced resignation :
“ Dear Friends and Colleagues at GSA ,
Early this evening I was asked to submit my resignation , and I have just done so .
It has been a great privilege to serve with all of you and to serve our nation and a great President .
The past twenty - two months have been filled with accomplishments : together , we have regained our clean audit opinion , restored fiscal discipline , re-tooled our ability to respond to emergencies , rekindled entrepreneurial energies , reduced bureaucratic barriers to small companies to get a GSA Schedule , ignited a building boom at our nation ’s ports of entries , boldly led the nation in an aggressive telework initiative , and improved employee morale so that we were selected as one of the best places to work in the Federal government .
These accomplishments are made even more enjoyable by the fact that there were lots of people who told us they could never be done .
Best of luck to all of you , it has been a true honor . ”
Update – Waxman issued this statement in reaction to Doan ’s resignation : “ I know this decision was difficult for the White House and Lurita Doan , but it was the right thing to do .
GSA should now be able to return to its nonpartisan tradition and its work as our government ’s premier contracting agency . ”
Rep. Tom Davis ( R - Va. ) , ranking member on Oversight and Government Reform , offered praise for Doan ’s tenure at GSA , although he noted that Doan ’s “ management style was not everyone ’s cup of tea , ” and admitted that Doan suffered from “ personality conflicts ” at the agency .
Davis also criticized Special Counsel Scott Bloch , who found last year that Doan had violated the Hatch Act and urged President Bush to remove her from office .
That law prohibits federal employees for using their offices for political activities .
“ It would be a shame if this decision had anything to do with the hyperbolic and unfounded allegations of Scott Bloch and others who were after her just to claim another administration scalp , ” Davis said in a statement released by his office .
“ There ’s no doubt personality conflicts played a role .
Certainly , her management style was not everyone ’s cup of tea .
Davis added : ” But the administrator appears to have fallen victim to a bureaucratic culture that fears , rather than rewards , entrepreneurial spirit , innovation and bold leadership .
Lurita Doan ’s legacy at GSA should be viewed as a positive one , and her attempts to bring private sector best practices to the agency should be applauded . ” 

Lory Lybeck , attorney for former RIAA defendant Tanya Andersen , has filed an amended complaint in her malicious prosecution lawsuit against the record labels and the RIAA .
It 's Lybeck 's fourth attempt at crafting a complaint acceptable to the judge , and , if it is successful , it will set the stage for what Andersen hopes will be far - ranging discovery into the RIAA 's tactics throughout its long - running legal campaign against P2P users .
Andersen 's first three complaints have all been dismissed by the judge presiding over the case , but Judge Anna J. Brown has given Andersen leave to refile each time .
The initial complaint , which accused the RIAA of racketeering , fraud , invasion of privacy , deceptive business practices , and a host of other misdeeds , was dismissed by Judge Brown in February .
In her decision , she indicated that Andersen failed to adequately state claims for relief , but gave her leave to refile an amended complaint .
That second amended complaint was refiled in mid-March , with Lybeck telling Ars that it would focus on the RIAA 's " sham litigation " and its " abuse of the federal judiciary to operate [ its ] criminal enterprise . "
The RIAA was critical of the 108 - page filing , arguing that it was " long on rhetoric , hyperbole , and scandalous allegations . "
The group also said that Lybeck ignored the judge 's instructions to file a " plain and concise " complaint .
Judge Brown apparently agreed with the RIAA 's take , dismissing the second complaint as well , and a third complaint filed in early April was dismissed on April 21 .
In her most recent ruling , the judge indicated her belief that the racketeering claims would be difficult to successfully litigate ; accordingly , the fourth complaint has dropped references to state and federal RICO violations .
Lybeck has said that he may seek the judge 's permission to refile those claims , presumably depending on how discovery goes .
Tanya Andersen
The latest complaint is still intended to be a class - action lawsuit filed on behalf of others who have been mistakenly targeted by the RIAA 's " campaign of threat and intimidation . "
The RIAA stands accused of conspiracy and abuse of the legal process , negligence , acting criminally " in ' investigating ' and pursuing claims against class members , " wire fraud , mail fraud , and wrongfully filing lawsuits .
Laying the background for the allegations in the lawsuit , Andersen cites the famous " driftnet " comment uttered by a former RIAA spokesperson as well as a statement made during a deposition by MediaSentry 's former president that its " investigative scheme " suffered from " serious flaws . "
But the central piece of Andersen 's complaint is the RIAA 's conduct in Atlantic v. Andersen .
She says that the RIAA could have with very little effort discovered the true identity of " gotenkito@KaZaA , " the P2P user observed by MediaSentry , but instead chose to pursue its case against her — despite having " actually already identified the real ' gotenkito ' " over 10 months before dismissing the case against her .
As this is the fourth complaint filed in Andersen v. Atlantic , the judge may not be inclined to give her attorney a fifth shot .
Lybeck 's latest effort weighs in at a relatively svelte 39 pages , a little more than one - third the length of the second complaint .
Lybeck has accused the RIAA of " operating a zone of secrecy " throughout its legal campaign , and hopes that last week 's filing will mark the beginning of the end for the labels and their legal campaign .
The RIAA 's response to the lawsuit is due by May 20 .
Some conservative economists say that increased deficits in the short run are an acceptable tradeoff for tax cuts that they say will promote economic growth in the long run .
And many liberal economists say that some of the Democratic spending proposals , like addressing the affordability of health care or improving education , are long - overdue investments that pay off handsomely even if they entail more red ink .
Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton have acknowledged that their various new programs would be costly but have outlined how to pay for them .
But some fiscal monitors say they may be relying on overly rosy projections of how much savings their proposals would actually yield .
Mrs. Clinton has calculated that her universal health care plan would cost about $ 110 billion a year , while Mr. Obama ’s somewhat more modest proposal would cost up to $ 65 billion annually , his advisers say .
Both candidates have also talked of new government incentives and investment to encourage the development of alternative sources of energy , which would cost about $ 15 billion a year .
The Democratic candidates have suggested that they could finance these and other programs by allowing parts of the Bush tax cuts to expire .
That , however , ignores projections of the Congressional Budget Office , which has already assigned those savings to deficit reduction .
In other words , unlike Mr. McCain , both Democrats say they would revoke the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy .
“ At a time of war and economic hardship , the last thing we need is a permanent tax cut for Americans who do n’t need them and were n’t even asking for them , ” Mr. Obama said .
But they would retain those reductions meant to benefit poor and “ middle - class ” families , which they defined as the 97 percent or so of the population that lives on less than $ 250,000 a year , and they would count the estimated $ 50 billion generated by higher taxes on the wealthy as new revenue .
“ Remember , you can only use this money once , ” said Mr. Bixby of the Concord Coalition , “ and with all the Bush tax cuts scheduled to expire , that money is already scheduled to come into the Treasury .
But on the campaign trail , this has become a source of new spending . ”

WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton replaced the longtime chief strategist of her struggling presidential campaign after the disclosure that he was working with Colombia 's government to help win congressional approval of a trade pact that she opposes .
The move comes two weeks before the pivotal Pennsylvania Democratic primary , where trade issues are likely to play a big role .
In a statement , campaign manager Maggie Williams said that " after the events of the last few days , Mark Penn asked to give up his role as chief strategist . " ...
Bjork has long been a supporter of Tibetan independence
Her cry followed a powerful performance of her song Declare Independence .
Talk of Tibetan independence is considered taboo in China , which has ruled the territory since 1951 .
China 's culture ministry said the outburst " broke Chinese law and hurt Chinese people 's feelings " and pledged to " further tighten controls " .
" We will further tighten controls on foreign artists performing in China in order to prevent similar cases from happening in the future , " the ministry said in a statement on its website .
" We shall never tolerate any attempt to separate Tibet from China and will no longer welcome any artists who deliberately do this . "
I am not a politician , I am first and last a musician
Bjork
The statement said there was " no country that admits that Tibet is an independent country " .
Bjork said she " would like to put importance on that I am not a politician , I am first and last a musician and as such I feel my duty to try to express the whole range of human emotions " .
On her website , she said : " This song was written more with the personal in mind .
" But the fact that it has translated to its broadest meaning , the struggle of a suppressed nation , gives me much pleasure . "
A spokeswoman from the culture ministry told the AFP news agency Bjork could be banned from performing in China if there was a repeat performance .
" If Bjork continued to behave like that in the future , we may consider never allowing her to perform in China , " she said .
Global struggles
Human rights activists and many politicians abroad have criticised Chinese policy in Tibet .
Many Tibetans feel loyal to the exiled spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , whom China considers a separatist threat .
The song Declare Independence has previously been used by Bjork to highlight other struggles for self - rule .
She dedicated a performance of it in Japan last month to Kosovo .
She has also used the song to campaign for Greenland and the Faroe Islands - territories controlled by Denmark .
Her behaviour at Sunday 's Shanghai concert has not been reported in the state - controlled Chinese media .
Since its launch in 1990 , the Human Genome Project has earned worldwide admiration , racked up $ 437 million in US government funding , and even landed its own day ( April 25 is National DNA Day ) .
But the genome alone can't explain how our bodies work .
For that , you need to decode a lot of other " - omes " — all the complex biological systems that regulate how we develop .
( The suffix is borrowed from the word chromosome , but scientists have gotten pretty fast and loose with it . )
Tracking them all requires an omeome .

For immediate release from John McCain 's campaign :
When questioners suggested that this move would n't actually change how much consumers spend to fill their tanks , McCain responded " Well , neither would my previous proposal " .
In unrelated election news , the McCain campaign announced that P.T. Barnum has been posthumously appointed as their policy director .
Also , Hillary Clinton has proposed a suspension of the law of gravity , at least during the summer flying season , to help the beleaguered airline industry .
Barack Obama reportedly had no comment on these suggestions , other than to say that Americans are definitely " atwitter " about gas prices .
Harvard scholar Linda Bilmes speaks about the book on the Iraq war ’s costs that she wrote with Joseph Stiglitz .
The two former Truthdiggers of the Week have been working hard to uncover even more hidden expenses for the war , which they estimate will cost the taxpayers and their children trillions of dollars .
Listen to this interview .
Transcript :
James Harris :
This is Truthdig .
James Harris here with Linda Bilmes .
She is the co-author of the new book , “ The Three Trillion Dollar War . ”
She ’s also a Harvard economist , and she did serve in the Department of Commerce during the Clinton administration .
As we watch the sensational news coverage of the governor of New York ’s resignation , “ The Three Trillion Dollar War ” reminds us that nearly 4,000 American soldiers and more than half a million Iraqis have been killed in this war .
And that spending will total more than $ 3 trillion .
Linda , why is it important that we take this war , and our spending , more seriously ?
Linda Bilmes :
Well , I think if you look at what happened throughout this war , we have essentially translated the human cost into a financial cost , and then we ’ve deferred that cost to the next generation .
So what I mean is , we are fighting the war with a volunteer Army , with soldiers and Marines who we pay , and with another army of contractors who we pay , but all of that money has … been borrowed .
So , in effect , the average American has not felt the cost of the war , either in blood or in treasure , and that accounts for the fact that although I think people feel very badly about it , it is not as immediately gripping as some of the scandals in the news .
Harris :
You ’d mentioned off - air that you ’re not a very popular person at the White House right now .
In a nutshell , they ’re saying it ’s easy to go in a room , write a book and point fingers about how much this war costs .
The White House ’s position to this point is , pretty much , “ What ’s the cost of doing nothing ?
What is the cost of not bringing democracy to Iraq ? ”
How do you respond ?
Bilmes :
Well , you know , and actually , first of all , it is very challenging to write a book like this because the numbers are simply not there .
The way the government keeps its accounts is very misleading , and government accounting is very poor .
So they do n’t actually produce any materials that would enable the average person who does n’t spend two years working on it and uses the Freedom of Information Act — without doing that , you really cannot tabulate all of the costs of the war that are hidden and all the long - term costs .
And so when the president says that he does not go to war , as he said , “ on the basis of green - eye - shaded accountants , ” I think we should all consider whether it is correct to go to war with no idea of what it ’s going to cost .
And you know the president and his advisers said that this war would cost us $ 50 or $ 60 billion .
At the time Larry Lindsey , who was the economics adviser , said that it might cost $ 200 billion , and he was fired for that moment of honesty .
And now we have a situation where even the Congressional Budget Office is saying that this war will cost $ 1.7 to $ 2.7 trillion , we have our estimate of $ 3 trillion at least .
The Joint Economic Committee says it will cost $ 3.5 trillion .
So there is a general consensus that the cost is so large that it is of very considerable concern and that it is having a major impact on our economy .
So I do n’t see how one can ignore this any longer .
Harris :
Why is it that there is no accountability for the spending that has taken place over the last five years ?
Bilmes :
Well , that is a very good question .
There is no accountability for the spending that has taken place .
And , unlike any other war , in this war , the United States cut taxes and raised spending at the same time it was going to war .
And , unlike any other war — apart from the Revolutionary War — we borrowed something close to 40 percent of the money for this war from overseas .
You know , in the Revolutionary War , the colonies borrowed from France .
So we have financed this war with debt , and if you look at how the money for the war has been appropriated in Congress , it is simply … it is simply unbelievable .
But all of the money has been appropriated through a series of what are called “ Emergency Supplementals . ”
And what these are is a vehicle that exists in order to circumvent the normal checks and balances on budget spending .
And it exists because , in certain circumstances , in genuine emergencies , such as Katrina , you want to get the money to the field very , very quickly without going through the normal budgetary process .
But here we are , five years , 25 supplemental appropriations later , still funding the war on a bipartisan basis through this emergency mechanism which denies both Democratic and Republican budget experts in the Congress and in the Budget Office and other places the chance to actually look at how much it costs to get anything done .
And under these circumstances , it is inevitable that we will see the kind of shenanigans that we have seen in terms of profiteering and corruption and cost overruns and overpayments to Halliburton , and money on which , as the Pentagon puts it , we have “ lost visibility . ”
Harris :
So 25 times over the last five years we ’ve used this discretionary funding , these Emergency Supplemental Funds .
And you said this is done to circumvent the normal budgetary process .
That sounds like a short way of saying , “ We can get this by them if we do it this way . ”
Have any laws been broken ?
Bilmes :
Well , you know , here you have a situation where , I mean , laws have not been broken because there ’s no law that would have anticipated that anyone would have done something like this .
The reason for having this Emergency Supplemental concept in the first place is so that , if Congress enacts something new during the year or if there was a genuine emergency , that there is a way to get money quickly to a new program or to an emergency area .
And what has happened here is that you had an administration and a Congress that has not wanted to face , or to vote on the full cost of the war .
So instead you ’ve had a series of dribs and drabs that have been appropriated outside the regular budgetary caps .
And we as taxpayers have all seen this : $ 25 billion here , $ 72 billion here , $ 52 billion here .
It ’s gone on and on and on , to the point that people are almost , I think , hardly notice .
And this is , I think , one of the things we have criticized heavily .
But , in addition , what ’s important about the money that is being appropriated is that this is simply the tip of the iceberg in terms of the total cost of the war .
Because the money that has been appropriated to date , the $ 800 billion that will have been appropriated for the wars through 2008 , that is only paying for the combat operations .
That ’s the monthly — annual burn rate of the operations going on in the field right now .
And that ignores the cost of taking care of our veterans when they come home , providing disability compensation for our veterans , of replenishing all the military equipment that ’s been used up , of resetting the military forces to their prewar strength , and of paying interest on all the money we ’ve borrowed to pay for the war .
So if you add all of those up , you essentially double or triple the amount of money that we are spending every month .
Harris :
One of the more telling lines from your book discusses veteran payouts from the first Gulf War .
You write , “ The United States still spends over $ 4.3 billion each year paying compensation , pension , disability benefits to more than 200,000 veterans of the Gulf War . ”
What do you think veterans ’ benefits and health care will cost us 20 years from now for this war ?
Bilmes :
Well , it ’s a very good question because the important thing to note about veterans ’ disability benefits is that they grow over time and they peak many , many years after the war .
For example , in the Spanish American War , the peak year for paying disability benefits was 50 years after the end of the war .
In World War II , these benefits peaked in 1993 .
In the Vietnam War we are currently paying out some $ 20 billion a year in disability benefits .
And even in the first Gulf War , which was a one - month war , we are spending $ 4.3 billion a year in paying disability benefits .
So , in this war we ’ve had a very , very high rate of casualties .
We have had 1.65 million troops deployed , over 70,000 of them wounded in combat or injured in accidents or contracting serious diseases that required them to be medically airlifted out of the country .
There have been another 250,000 who have been treated for other things at veterans hospitals and clinics and , of those , 68,000 have been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder .
There have been near - epidemic problems with hearing .
Hearing loss , vision problems , joint problems .
And the long - term cost of caring for our servicemen and - women will be felt by the next generation .
We expect that , overall , if you include medical care and disability benefits , the cost of taking care of our veterans will cost around $ 600 billion , depending on — in today ’s money .
Harris : I was always taught — when I was spending a significant amount of money — to think about the consequence of that spending .
Not so much how much money I lost , but what else that money could have been spent on .
So when you say just a portion of this war has cost us upwards of $ 600 billion , what are some other things that we could have spent this money on ?
Bilmes :
Well , the opportunity costs are really staggering .
For the amount of money we ’ve spent so far , we could have made Social Security solvent for the next 75 years .
We could have provided universal health care to children .
We could have paid for a significant investment in our infrastructure here at home in paying for our own roads and bridges and tunnels and electrical grids instead of essentially spending that money on repairs and construction in Iraq , much of which has been bombed and attacked and had to be reconstructed again and again .
And I think that the amount of money is so large that it ’s almost hard to conceive what a large amount of money this is .
For example , I was reading a report that the Centers for Disease Control issued last week .
This is their long - awaited report on autism .
And the Centers for Disease Control say that one in every 150 American children is now being diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder , which is a huge number .
And we spend , in the Federal Government , $ 108 million a year on autism research , which is the equivalent of four hours of the Iraq war in cash costs , not even counting all the veterans and other costs .
So once you start thinking about it in that way , and there ’s almost a new method of measurement now , in Washington , of how many hours , how many days of the Iraq war would it cost to pay for this or that .
And certainly in many communities throughout the country there are very serious problems which require investments — infrastructure problems , problems with homelessness , problems for the elderly — which would require … the amounts of money required are minutes or hours of the cost of fighting in Iraq .
Harris : Linda , there ’s a growing sentiment that we are spending too much money on the war in Iraq .
How would you reallocate funds in a way that … puts us on a path to recovery ?
How would you reform this process ?
Bilmes :
Well , we have , in our book , a chapter on exiting Iraq , in which we lay out the fundamental question about whether it is worth spending another $ 600 to $ 900 billion to stay in Iraq , in the way that we are , for the next two or three years .
We also lay out in another chapter a number of recommendations that would make , hopefully , it less likely for us to get embroiled in this kind of quagmire again .
Some of those recommendations have to do with transparency of financial reporting , of better control and oversight over where our money is going , of better checks and balances between the Congress and the executive .
And a very important thing which we have not touched on yet is improvements in the way our veterans are being treated .
And if I can just say one point about that :
We wrote the book for two reasons .
Partly because we believe that the public has a right to know how much the war is costing and , secondly , to call attention to the fact that our veterans are being shortchanged .
And we discovered this , essentially by accident , as we were doing our research .
We discovered that many veterans are encountering an enormously difficult bureaucratic battlefield when they come home , just trying to get their disability benefits and get access to doctors for their disabilities that they have suffered .
And this is something which is particularly painful because it ’s a fixable problem .
There are some parts of the Iraq situation that are very , very difficult and complicated .
But doing right by our veterans should not be impossible to fix .
And we ’ve laid out , in our book , a series of steps that would improve substantially the situation for returning veterans .
Harris : I actually do mean to harp on this because I agree with you that it is important to respect the veterans .
After all , they are doing a service that we ’ve asked them to .
Can you share with us some of the stories , some of the accounts from veterans returned from Iraq , veterans who had trouble accessing their benefits ?
Bilmes :
We had , during the course of our research — and we had written two papers previously , one specifically on veterans — we had hundreds of veterans and current military servicemen write to us with their concerns .
But I think a typical story is a story of a 19 - year - old soldier .
His name is Patrick .
He ’s from Texas .
His aunt wrote to us because Patrick had been seriously wounded in Iraq .
He had been in four hospitals , he had been , miraculously , after nine months , in Walter Reed and so forth , he had recovered .
He had been visited by President Bush in the hospital .
He received a Purple Heart , and so forth .
But when he got back to Sugar Land , Texas , he was , for 18 months , unable to receive a single penny in disability compensation or any money that would have enabled him to take some online training courses and other training that he wanted .
So , he could n’t do his previous job as a mechanic again because he could n’t stand up , but he wanted to try and acquire some training in another field .
And it was only after his aunt contacted us and we looked into this story and we contacted Newsweek magazine , that decided to put him on the cover , or threatened to put him on the cover , that all of a sudden , remarkably , all of his benefits were paid retroactively for 18 months , from the veterans organizations .
Harris : Sure .
Bilmes : But , I mean , there are hundreds of stories .
We tell some of them in the book .
But the fundamental issue is that the system for transitioning troops from the military to veteran status is not working .
There is no seamless transition .
And what we should be doing is we should be automatically providing disability benefits to our returning veterans who are wounded .
Instead , when they come back , even if they are in a wheelchair , we are forcing them to prepare the equivalent of a graduate school application with dozens of different forms and pieces of paperwork that they have to fill in correctly before they can even begin the process of securing disability benefits .
And on the medical side there are fantastic doctors and very dedicated nurses in many veterans hospitals and facilities , but there simply is not enough of them , and particularly if it ’s a nationwide network , there are many veterans who are coming back , particularly needing mental health care , who simply do not have access to these facilities .
Harris :
And you mentioned , minutes ago , that we will spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of the next 20 years alone on these types of care initiatives , helping veterans who ’ve returned .
Do you get the sense that a majority of the soldiers that return will be treated properly or do you get the sense that they will be stiffed ?
Bilmes :
Well , you know , that ’s a good question .
I think that there are many excellent advocates in the veterans service organizations who are working very , very hard on behalf of veterans .
I think there is a bipartisan desire to do right by our veterans .
On the other hand , when you look at some of the stories that have surfaced , it is hard not to feel depressed .
We discovered , for example , that veterans who are enlisting and taking signing bonuses , if they are wounded , have been asked to repay their signing bonuses because they did n’t serve out their contract .
We have found — and the GAO has chronicled hundreds of veterans who are being chased and hounded for small amounts of money that they allegedly owe the government , in most cases related to pieces of equipment that they lost because they were wounded or their vehicle exploded .
So some of these stories are deeply disturbing , but I do believe this is an area where the American public feels very strongly that they want to fix the problem .
And I just hope that we can change the mentality , change the culture of the Veterans Affairs Department to one which basically , instead of trying to sort of pre-audit every veteran before we give them the benefit , we should give them the benefit when they come home , and then we can audit a subset of them later , which is what the IRS does .
We do n’t all have our taxes audited , but we audit all of the veterans .
Harris :
You and Joseph Stiglitz have done this remarkable evaluation of the way that money is being spent over there .
Due respect , neither of you is in a position to change the policy on this .
Do you get the sense that the policy that governs spending during times of war will actually be changed ?
What ’s your gut tell you ?
Bilmes :
Well , I think that , in terms of veterans , we do see some encouraging signs .
There are currently 18 pieces of legislation pending which are based , in some form , on our recommendations .
There is a strong , bipartisan desire to improve the situation for veterans .
And some of the recommendations of the Dole - Shalala commission , which were sensible , have also been enacted .
So I think there is some reason for optimism there .
On the other hand , I do not see any progress in trying to bring greater transparency and greater financial accountability to the Pentagon .
We ’ve had a situation there where the Pentagon has flunked its financial audit every year for the past 10 years , where they have thousands of material weaknesses throughout their balance sheet and they are essentially unauditable .
Whereas pretty much the entire rest of government has been able to figure out ways to track where its money goes .
And I think until we get really serious about making financial accountability for money important in the Pentagon — important and required — essentially what we did for the private sector with the Sarbanes - Oxley bill — until we do something similar in the Pentagon , I am not optimistic that we will have a better understanding of how our taxes are spent with regards to the military .
Harris :
You said earlier that it appears that no crimes have been committed or no laws have been broken .
Policy aside and politics aside , I think crimes have been committed ; both American and Iraqi citizens have been wronged on a scale much larger than we will ever be able to imagine , and that there seems to be nothing tangible that we can reach out and say , “ OK but at least that ’s going to happen , ” or “ At least she ’s going to make a change . ”
I do n’t see that , and it ’s quite disheartening as you mentioned earlier .
This could be depressing .
Bilmes :
Well , it could be , and I think one of the things that we found in writing the book was that , every single week , we kept coming across another incredible , unbelievable finding .
I mean , it was to the point where whoever — Joe or I — found it , we were saying , “ No , this ca n ’t be . ”
But it was .
“ No , this ca n’t be . ”
But it was .
Just last week , another one emerged when it was discovered that the major contractor in Iraq , which is the Halliburton subsidiary KBR — and this really is an incredible one — has been employing its workers using a shell company in the Cayman Islands , thereby evading hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. taxes .
Now , this is not right .
Now , it was not breaking a law because there was no law saying you could n’t do that because no one imagined it would be done .
But here we have a situation where sort of official , our official contractor , who is deeply embedded in every aspect of the war , is evading paying U.S. taxes for its employees .
And we will feel the pinch about this because eventually those employees will need Medicare and Social Security and they will have never paid into the system and this only exacerbates our already looming health care and Social Security crisis .
Harris :
One of the things that this text , “ The Three - Trillion - Dollar War , ” does extremely well is outline a plan that prevents this from happening again .
It also speaks to some of the insufficiencies of the Constitution .
Can you tell me a little bit more about that ?
Bilmes :
It certainly speaks to a series of limitations .
We do go through , in our book , a whole chapter of changes , legal and regulatory changes that we think should be enacted to prevent this kind of thing from happening again because we have certainly seen that it has been possible for this war to be conducted in a way that , I think , very few Americans — whether they were in favor of the war initially or not — very few Americans would have wanted to see the war conducted in the manner in which it has been .
Harris :
At a time when our nation appears desperately in need of a recipe for change , here comes this book , “ The Three - Trillion - Dollar War . ”
This should be required reading for every American citizen and every American politician , most certainly .
Linda Bilmes , thank you for joining us .
Bilmes :
Thank you .
Harris : For Linda Bilmes , this is James Harris , and this is Truthdig .
I admit it : I 'm an adult ( although I suppose that 's arguable ) who watches cartoons .
And I 'm not just talking The Simpsons or Family Guy ( although I like those too ) – I have a real thing for [ adult swim ] on the Cartoon Network .
I know I 'm not alone – those guys ( and gals ) at Williams Street have a major cult following .
I enjoy most of their shows – excluding anime , sorry – but thought I 'd highlight a few of my favorites and share some of the behind - the - scenes stories from them .
Metalocalypse
I 'm not a fan of death metal , but this show cracks me up .
It follows the exploits of the band Dethklok - lead singer Nathan Explosion , Pickles the drummer ( doodily doo , ding - dong doodily - doodily - doo ) , lead guitarist Skwisgaar Skwigelf ( taller than a tree ) , rhythm guitarist Toki Wartooth ( not a Bumblebee ) and bassist William Murderface ( Murderface , Murderface , Murderface ) .
Dethklok is the biggest band in the world and their fans follow them rabidly – even to the point of death .
The government is really concerned that Dethklok is going to use their extremely dedicated fanbase to take over the world , so a Tribunal has been formed to gather information about and ultimately dispose of the band .
And now , the trivia :
• Nathan 's parents are Oscar and Rose Explosion of New Port Richey , Florida .
• Murderface 's tattoos say " Pobody 's Nerfect " and " This Place is a Mess " .
• Musicians love the show , at least based on the number of them that have had cameos .
James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett of Metallica ; Jeff Loomis , Steve Smyth and Warrel Dane of Nevermore ; as well as members of Cannibal Corpse , Zyklon , Strapping Young Lad , Emperor , Dimmu Borgir and violinist Emilie Autumn .
• Dethklok is going on tour this summer .
How ?
The series co-creator , Brendon Small , says they will tour in a manner similar to the Gorillaz – the people who play the instruments for the animated characters will be the ones going on tour .
• Skwisgaar is a member of two side projects – 10 Points to Gryffindor , a Harry Potter tribute band ; and
Depantsification Proclamation , a nudist Civil War - styled band .
• Toki hates Rachael Ray .
We do n't know why .
• Pickles has asthma .
Frisky Dingo
OK , take Bruce Wayne but give him the personality of Brody Jenner .
That 's Xander Crews , AKA Awesome X , the " superhero " of Frisky Dingo .
Now take … umm …
OK , remember Arnold Schwarzenegger in his body - building days ?
Take that body , make him albino , give him a British accent …
OK , no , nevermind .
Our villain , Killface , is really in a category all of his own .
He 's a giant , white , British alien , it would seem , and he 's hell - bent on taking over the world / blowing it up with the Annihilatrix .
The thing that makes it such a funny show is that it juxtaposes the fantastical world of superheroes and villains with the mundane – the Xtacles , for example , are really concerned about life insurance and benefits .
Killface has a dysfunctional relationship with his son , Simon .
A few more interesting facts about Frisky Dingo :
• The name of the show was originally Whiskey Tango , but that name was already taken by a band .
To avoid legal issues , the name was changed to Frisky Dingo .
• Awesome X's minions are called the Xtacles , which cracks me up every time I hear it .
• Killface , Xander , Simon and Taqu'il ( Simon 's favorite rapper ) all have their own MySpace pages .
Killface 's MySpace says he is 7 ' 6 " , 47 years old and loves anything with Sir Sidney Poitier in it .
Xander flatly states he is only on the Internet to meet women ; his favorite singers are Phil Collins and Sting and his favorite book is How to Succeed in Business Without Ever Trying Ever .
• Exactly what does Frisky Dingo mean ?
The code words to activate the Annihilatrix ( therefore blowing up the world ) are … yep … " Frisky Dingo " .
• The creators , Adam Reed and Matt Thompson , also created SeaLab 2021 , which also happens to be one of my favorites …
Sealab 2021
One of [ adult swim ] 's favorite tricks seems to be dubbing over old cartoons with subversive dialogue .
In this case , Adam Reed and Matt Thompson took the old Hanna - Barbera environmental cartoon Sealab 2020 , which only aired for 13 episodes in 1972 .
In Sealab 2021 , instead of trying to save the environment , the crew pretty much spends all of their time trying to avoid work .
A few things you might not have known :
• Marco Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar Gabriel Garcia Marquez has a thing for the t.v. show CHiPs , which happens to star Erik Estrada .
Guess who provides the voice for Marco Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar Gabriel Garcia Marquez ?
… Erik Estrada .
• The main character of the show , Captain Hazel " Hank " Murphy , was voiced by Harry Goz .
When Goz died in 2003 and Captain Murphy left Sealab to go fight in the Great Spice Wars .
Captain Bellerophon " Torpedo " Shanks was recruited for the open position via a " Help Wanted " ad and took over as Captain of Sealab – he was voiced by Harry Goz ' son , Michael Goz .
• There were real SEALABs – three of them , in fact .
The first one was lowered off the coast of Bermuda in 1964 but stopped after only 11 days because a tropical storm was headed in that direction .
SEALAB II was placed in La Jolla Canyon off the coast of California in 1965 .
Tuffy the Porpoise delivered supplies to SEALAB II .
Seriously .
SEALAB III of 1969 was pretty much disastrous .
First , the habitat started to leak and the six divers sent to repair it were unsuccessful .
Then , aquanaut Barry Cannon died of carbon monoxide poisoning because of a faulty breathing apparatus .
Finally , it appeared that someone was trying to sabotage the air supply of the five other divers .
The SEALAB experiments were stopped after that .
Harvey Birdman , Attorney at Law
In a similar vein , the Cartoon Network took the old Hanna - Barbera cartoon Birdman and the Galaxy Trio and created Harvey Birdman , Attorney at Law .
The original cartoon featured Ray Randall , AKA Birdman , who was just a regular human being until the Sun God Ra endowed him with the ability to shoot " solar rays " and " solar shields " from his fists .
Oh , and the ability to fly , obviously .
His trademark is his battle cry of " Biiiiiiiiirdman ! !!! "
The updated version has Our Hero , now named Harvey , as a retired superhero who practices law with other old Hanna - Barbera cartoon characters like Peter Potamus and the Blue Falcon .
He represents or prosecutes other characters , including the Scooby Doo posse ( accused of pot possession ) , Fred Flintstone ( racketeering ) and Grape Ape ( Steroid use ) .
• The law firm on the show , Sebben and Sebben , is a play on the drink Seven and Seven .
• Stephen Colbert is the voice of Myron Reducto , Phil Ken Sebben and The Eagle of Truth
• Lots of characters from Birdman and the Galaxy Trio were recycled for Harvey Birdman .
o The original Avenger is Birdman 's friend and can carry him when Birdman is unable to fly .
Updated Avenger is Harvey 's legal secretary and does a lot of filing and taking dictation .
o Falcon - 7 is Birdman 's government contact .
Updated Falcon - 7 is actually Phil Ken Sebben , one of the partners of Sebben and Sebben Law .
o
The original Birdboy is a boy who was rescued by Birdman because he was near - death .
To revive the boy , Birdman transferred some of his powers .
The updated Birdboy is now called Peanut and was hired by Harvey to be his legal clerk .
He wears a sweater vest and has a rivalry with Avenger .
o Birdgirl was created by Birdman 's nemesis to destroy him , but she realized that she was being used for evil and defected to Birdman 's side .
Updated Birdgirl is the alter - ego of Judy Ken Sebben , Phil Ken Sebben 's daughter .
Phil does n't know the identity of Birdgirl and hits on her whenever she shows up .
o Reducto was a mad scientist who uses a shrink ray on his enemies .
In modern times , he 's Myron Reducto , a rival lawyer .
He and Birdman now only argue in the courtroom ; outside of work they are friends and even carpool to work .
Space Ghost Coast to Coast
Space
Ghost is the show that kicked off the trend of taking an old cartoon and retooling it for [ adult swim ] viewers .
Space Ghost 's original debut was in 1966 in Space Ghost and Dino Boy .
Space Ghost 's talk show , however , started its run in 1994 .
Space Ghost Coast to Coast features the man himself interviewing various celebrities .
In a strange twist of events , his old enemies Zorak , Moltar and Brak now work for his show as his bandleader , producer and …
Brak .
• Four rocks found on Mars have been named Space Ghost , Zorak , Moltar and Brak .
• One of the show 's writers was Joel Hodgson , the creator / star / writer of Mystery Science Theater 3000 .
• The interview process is a bit odd for the people being interviewed .
They are placed into an all - black room and " Space Ghost " asks them questions via speaker phone .
Their answers are later chopped up and applied to completely different questions .
• Guests include Weird Al , Adam West , Michael Stipe ( Space Ghost says , " Is that you in the corner ? " and Michael Stipe responds , " Yes , it is . " ) , Slash , Hulk Hogan , Tenacious D , Jim Carrey , Willie Nelson , Conan O'Brien , Tyra Banks and Ben Stiller .
My other favorite [ adult swim ] offerings are Robot Chicken , Tom Goes to the Mayor and The Oblongs ( though it 's not a Williams Street production ) .
Any other [ adult swim ] fans out there ?
What are your favorites ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The biggest day of U.S. presidential nominating contests kicked off on Tuesday with Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton battling for advantage and Republican John McCain aiming to knock Mitt Romney out of the race .
Republican Mike Huckabee struck the first blow on Tuesday with a win in West Virginia , one of 24 states holding nominating contests on “ Super Tuesday ” that will yield a huge haul of delegates to this summer ’s conventions to nominate candidates for the November presidential election .
Clinton , a New York senator , was hoping to hold off a late surge by Obama , an Illinois senator who has almost caught her in national polls and leads in several states taking part in the coast - to - coast voting .
“ The fact that we ’ve made so much progress I think indicates that we ’ve got the right message , ” Obama said on NBC ’s “ Today ” show .
More than half the total Democratic delegates and about 40 percent of the Republican delegates are up for grabs .
Georgia is the first state to end voting at 7 p.m. EST ( 2400 GMT ) .
Huckabee , a Baptist preacher and former Arkansas governor , won in the second round of balloting at the West Virginia Republican convention after Romney led on the first ballot .
Huckabee was aided by McCain voters who switched to him to deny Romney a victory , drawing a protest from Romney ’s camp .
“ This is what Senator McCain ’s inside Washington ways look like : he cut a backroom deal with the tax - and - spend candidate he thought could best stop Governor Romney ’s campaign of conservative change , ” Romney campaign manager Beth Myers said .
McCain criticized Romney for complaining .
“ Generally speaking , rather than blame it on someone else , I suggest that he move on , ” McCain told reporters .
“ It ’s a bit insulting to Gov. Huckabee , who won that , by suggesting such a thing . ”
Economic concerns -- plunging housing values , rising energy and food prices , jittery financial markets and new data showing a big contraction in the service sector -- have eclipsed the Iraq war as voters ’ top concern , opinion polls show .
BIGGEST PRIZE
A new Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll showed Romney leading McCain by 7 points in California , the biggest Super Tuesday prize .
But McCain , a senator from Arizona , held commanding double - digit advantages in many of the largest states .
Huckabee aimed for a strong showing in the South with its concentration of evangelical Christians .

Among Democrats , the Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll showed Obama opening a 13 - point lead on Clinton in California , where polls close at 11 p.m. EST ( 0400 GMT on Wednesday ) .
Other opinion polls showed a much tighter race in California , and close Democratic battles in many other states .
Clinton and Obama have split the first four significant contests and spent heavily on advertising from coast to coast .
“ None of us really understands what the impact of all these contests on one day will be , ” Clinton said on ABC ’s “ Good Morning America . ”
Slideshow ( 51 images )
Clinton voted in suburban New York , accompanied by her husband , former President Bill Clinton .
Obama voted in Chicago and then settled in for a possibly long night .
“ I think everybody is flying blind on this one , ” he told reporters , saying it was much harder to judge the outcome in so many states .
Because Democrats distribute delegates in proportion to their vote statewide and in individual congressional districts , candidates can come away with large numbers of delegates even in states they lose .
Aides for both campaigns predicted the contest would continue for weeks or months to come .
In contrast , many of the 21 Republican contests are winner - take - all when awarding delegates , meaning a strong day by McCain could give him a commanding lead .
DUELING COMMERCIALS
McCain predicted victory at an early - morning rally .
“ We ’re going to win today , we ’re going to win the nomination and we ’re going to win the presidency , ” McCain told a crowd of several hundred in New York ’s Rockefeller Center .
He then headed across country to California for one final campaign stop before returning to Arizona for the evening .
“ We ’re going to do well here , we ’re going to get the nomination , ” he said in San Diego .
In dueling commercials , McCain and Romney both invoked former President Ronald Reagan in an attempt to question each others ’ conservative credentials .
The two also clashed after Romney dismissed one of the Republican Party ’s senior figures , 1996 presidential nominee Bob Dole , who had rebuked conservative talk - show host Rush Limbaugh for criticizing McCain .

After reading an article on Time Magazine , discussed later in this article , it seemed that Time was sending a not so subtle message to the public , via innuendo , that required us to take a closer look at the situation in regards to the nation 's food supply .
On February 20 , Bloomberg.com published an article that should have enjoyed wide media coverage , however was relegated to the alternative news as our MSM did n’t see fit to warn America of the possibility of a looming global famine - and have been negligent in informing us that the food on hand in the United States is at a historic low , without question an issue of national security and survival .
We investigated this matter in - depth and an eventual probability of famine in the US is avoidable , at least in the short term , but without the public understanding the danger we face , nothing will be done to alleviate this danger to America :
Famines May Occur Without Record Crops This Year , Potash Says By Christopher Donville Feb. 20 ( Bloomberg ) —
Grain farmers will need to harvest record crops every year to meet increasing global food demand and avoid famine , Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. Chief Executive Officer William Doyle said .
People and livestock are consuming more grain than ever , draining world inventories and increasing the likelihood of shortages , Doyle said yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg Television .
Global grain stockpiles fell to about 53 days of supply last year , the lowest level since record - keeping began in 1960 , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
“ If you had any major upset where you did n’t have a crop in a major growing agricultural region this year , I believe you ’d see famine , ” Doyle , 57 , said in New York .
( Emphasis added )
Crop prices have soared as much as fourfold this decade because of increased demand for food in India and China , where hundreds of millions of people are moving up to the middle class and can afford to eat more meat from animals raised on grain - based feeds , Doyle said .
Soybean futures rose to a record $ 14.2875 a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade , capping an 85 percent gain in the past 12 months .
Wheat prices , which have more than doubled in the past year in Chicago , reached a record on Feb. 11 , and corn climbed to a record on Feb .
6 . “ There is a dietary shift occurring in China today , particularly amongst the young , ” Hugh Grant , chief executive officer of Monsanto Co. , the world ’s biggest seed producer , said in a Feb. 6 interview .
“ As protein consumption increases , as they move from fish to chicken , chicken to pork , and pork to beef , the demand for commodities increases almost by an order of magnitude . ”
' Enormous Pressure ’
“ We keep going to the cupboard without replacing and so there is enormous pressure on agriculture to have a record crop every year , ” Doyle said .
“ We need to have a record crop in 2008 just to stay even with this very low inventory situation . ”
MUCH MORE , EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE ARTICLE
It is this author ’s contention that this impending disaster , which I believe is essentially transparent once the facts are revealed , is being manufactured by political interests that place profit and power above the health and safety of the American public .
Spring is n’t here yet , and this is an issue the public can change if enough people become aware of the facts that are widely available on the Internet , but our fascist MSM continues to ignore and / or downplay the issues that are of vital interest to the average American .
It ’s no secret to the informed public that a global famine is destined to occur due to the persistent drought conditions which are worsening as per the effects of global warming and climate change .
Tough times lie ahead , but in today ’s world , it ’s unconscionable that the American public is being ripped - off so the wealthy can acquire more wealth while we suffer every time we visit the local store (s ) when the US food crisis is currently avoidable .
The crisis we face is two - fold ; the economic crisis , and the lopsided effect it will have on the lower middle - class , poor , and the countless millions of social security recipients and disabled is staggering !
Some families have attempted to stretch their budgets by driving less , and for the first time in years , gas consumption actually decreased and strapped families are curbing their driving in an effort to compensate for the rise in costs of the essentials that feed and supply every American family .
LINK
On the other hand , the nation ’s bulk of Social Security recipients , many who are already stretched to the max , face cutting “ what ” to make their budgets meet ?
For those who exist on less than a thousand dollars per month , who number in the millions , what essentials are they to cut out of their budgets to simply survive as we watch everything we buy rise in cost while wages remain stagnant and many are actually declining ?
This is a lower - class nightmare in the making , and for some , the reality of the nightmare has already come home to roost !
2007 was rough , but 2008 looks even worse and none of us know what nature has in store for us as it pertains to unusual weather patterns that have plagued the US for several years , affecting our agriculture , and are becoming even more unpredictable .
Food industry says prices headed up again in ‘ 08 By Rene Pastor WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Americans who dug deeper into their pockets for groceries last year will face sticker shock again this year when shopping for food , experts said on Thursday .
“ There ’s going to be real food inflation in this country , ” C. Larry Pope , president and chief executive of U.S. beef processor Smithfield Foods Inc. , said at the U.S. Agriculture Department ’s annual outlook conference .
Prices of grain futures have surged lately .
For example , wheat futures have more than doubled on the Chicago Board of Trade over the last 12 months .
Pope said meat shoppers eventually will pay for the rally because farmers who raise livestock cannot absorb the sharp escalation in feed costs .

This A growing number of bankruptcies among US retailers is set to prompt thousands of store closings , the New York Times will report on the front page of its Tuesday edition .
" The consumer spending slump and tightening credit markets are triggering a wave of bankruptcies in American retailing , " with ensuing store closures " expected to remake suburban malls and downtown shopping districts across the country , " writes Michael Barbaro for the Times .
Barbaro notes that over half a dozen store chains have filed for bankruptcy in recent months amidst " mounting debt and plummeting sales " and warns that financial troubles are " quickly spreading to bigger national companies . "
The Times articles comes amid a slew of reports underscoring America 's economic woes .
Even presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain , who only months ago panned talk of a recession , admitted today that he thought the country was now in one .
Even relatively well - off retailers face troubles .
Added Barbaro in the article , such store chains who can avoid bankruptcy " are shutting down stores to preserve cash through what could be a long economic downturn . "
Excerpts from the Times article , available in full at this link , follow ... #
The surging cost of necessities has led to a national belt - tightening among consumers .
Figures released on Monday showed that spending on food and gasoline is crowding out other purchases , leaving people with less to spend on furniture , clothing and electronics .
Consequently , chains specializing in those goods are proving vulnerable .
... " You have the makings of a wave of significant bankruptcies , " said Al Koch , who helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy in 2003 as the company 's interim chief financial officer and works at a corporate turnaround firm called AlixPartners .
" For years , no deal was too ugly to finance , " he said .
" But now , nobody will throw money at these companies . "
Because retailers rely on a broad network of suppliers , their bankruptcies are rippling across the economy .
The cash - strapped chains are leaving behind tens of millions of dollars in unpaid bills to shipping companies , furniture manufacturers , mall owners and advertising agencies .
Many are unlikely to be paid in full , spreading the economic pain .
...
In most cases , the collapses stemmed from a combination of factors : flawed business strategies , a souring economy and banks ' unwillingness to issue cheap loans . #

General Manager Frank Muscillo said the zoo , where the khaki - clad Irwin got up close with crocodiles and other wildlife at the 5,000 - seat “ Crocoseum ” , had done nothing wrong except fall victim to a “ highly sophisticated case of deception ” .
“ This situation has cost us a lot .
Not just in monetary terms but in respect of our reputation , ” Muscillo said in a statement to Reuters , adding that the zoo in tropical Queensland state was fully cooperating with the tax investigation .
Steve Irwin was killed in September 2006 when a stingray barb pierced his heart while he was filming a documentary .
His daughter Bindi and American - born wife Terri have vowed to continue his work on conservation and crocodile research .
The scheme , under investigation by the Australian Taxation Office , allowed the Irwin ’s zoo to claim large tax breaks by paying more than A$ 600,000 a year ( $ 550,000 ) in fees to a Singapore - based company , the Australian newspaper said .
Muscillo said the ATO investigation was linked to a A$ 2.5 million civil lawsuit against Terri Irwin and Australia Zoo which was in turn tied up in tax advice given to the Irwins and their advisers by a disgraced former ATO tax lawyer .
“ Clearly we wish we had not dealt with these organizations and people , ” Muscillo said .
“ We would certainly never knowingly have become involved or associated ourselves with anything illegal or deceitful , ” he said .
The zoo is being sued by a collection company over unpaid debts after the Irwins signed off on the tax scheme in 2005 , before the television naturalist ’s death .
Steve Irwin ’s father , meanwhile , told Australian television in an interview to be aired next Monday that he recently quit the zoo he founded 36 years ago , and which his son made famous , because he was becoming a “ disrupting influence ” .
“ It ’s a strange feeling to spend half your lifetime building something up and walking away from it .
I was becoming a disrupting influence , not that I meant to be , ” Bob Irwin told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television .
Magazine reports have suggested the 68 - year - old was upset with the direction of the zoo and the high - profile career of 9 - year - old Bindi Irwin , falling out with Terri Irwin .
Terri Irwin , who plans to extend the zoo to give it a “ Disneyland feel ” with luxury accommodation and more staff , has denied there is a rift between the two .

Advertisement Europe 's sophisticated new space truck , the ATV , has docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The unmanned vessel carries just under five tonnes of food , water , air , fuel and equipment for the orbiting platform 's three astronauts .
The Automated Transfer Vehicle used its own computerised systems to make the attachment at 1445 GMT .
Ground control and the ISS crew were on alert just in case there was a problem - but it was a textbook docking .
See where the ATV is right now The European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) station programme manager , Alan Thirkettle , said it was a great engineering achievement .
He told BBC News : " This is a first in the world - this is a fully automatic spacecraft that docked with the space station , totally under its own control , and that 's never been done before by anybody at all ; so from a purely technical point of view , it 's really quite incredible . "
Nicolas Chamussy , for lead manufacturer EADS Astrium , said the three weeks since launch leading up to docking , had been a remarkable period for the industrial teams .
" As a satellite manufacturer you never normally get to see your bird in flight - and we have ; that 's really amazing .
It has flown 20 million km since launch and to see it there in space is quite an emotion . "
Platform boost Moving at just a few centimetres per second , the 20 - tonne freighter moved towards the Russian Zvezda module , on the rear of the platform , and pulled itself onto the connection mechanism .
ATV - THE FIRSTS
The ATV is the first completely automated rendezvous and docking ship to go to the ISS The ATV is the largest and most powerful space tug going to the ISS over its mission life
It provides the largest refuelling and waste elimination capability for the space station
It is the only vehicle on the current timeline able to de-orbit the ISS when it is retired Mission Guide : Jules Verne
Alan Thirkettle A good seal will have to be confirmed , and electrical and piping contacts secured , before space station commander Peggy Whitson and her crew can open up the ATV .
Their first job will be to turn on a " scrubber " to make sure the air mixture inside the vehicle 's pressurised vessel contains no leaked hazardous vapours , and that no metal objects have come loose in transit that might cause injury .
It is expected to be Friday before the astronauts begin to use the stores on the ship - which has been dubbed " Jules Verne " for this mission .
One of the truck 's main tasks will be to raise the altitude of the station , which is currently at about 340 km .
The ISS has a tendency to fall back to Earth over time as it drags through the top of the atmosphere .
Every few weeks the freighter will fire its thrusters to accelerate the platform complex , taking it higher into the sky .
As the astronauts deplete the ship 's supplies , they will fill the empty storage racks with rubbish .
In a few months ' time , probably in August , Jules Verne will detach from the ISS and take itself and the waste into a controlled burn - up over the Pacific Ocean .
Four more trucks are booked to fly to the station between now and 2015 .
The logistics vehicles represent the subscription Europe must pay for its membership of the ISS project .
Cost : Total bill was 1.3bn euros ( at least 4 more ATVs will be built )
Total cargo capacity : 7.6 tonnes , but first mission is flying lighter Mass at launch : About 20 tonnes depending on cargo manifest Dimensions : 10.3 m long and 4.5 m wide - the size of a large bus Solar panels :
Once unfolded , the solar wings span 22.3 m
Engine power : 4 x 490 - Newton thrusters ; and 28 x 220N thrusters Mission Guide : Jules Verne
Fly with the ATV on a mission to the space station A quick guide the ATV 's main features
But Jules Verne 's significance goes well beyond mere cargo duties .
The automated systems that allow it to track down an object ( the ISS ) moving at 27,000 km/h , and attach itself with an accuracy of 2 cm , are beyond what other space - faring nations have at the moment - including the Russians and the US .
ATV technology gives Europe the capability to build its own mini-station " The ATV is a major step forward in terms of competence and capability for European Industry , and for the European space programme , " said Mr Thirkettle .
" We have demonstrated we can do things that we 've never been able to do before and that 's going to help a lot for the exploration future . "
The space truck 's technologies are expected to find applications in many more missions that require automatic rendezvous and docking .
These would include ventures that take humans back to the Moon or on to Mars .
Any attempt to retrieve rocks from the Red Planet for study in Earth labs would also need the sorts of sensors the ATV employs to join spacecraft together without manual assistance .
European independence At Esa HQ in Paris , however , space officials have even grander plans .
They believe Jules Verne 's technologies could eventually be incorporated into an independent European manned spaceship - perhaps one that looked similar to the Orion concept now being built by the Americans to replace the shuttle .
Currently , European astronauts are totally dependent on the US or Russia to get into space .
Europe has demonstrated very capable launcher technology with its Ariane rockets ; it has shown with the ATV it can build human - rated spacecraft that are highly navigable .
With further technological development - on re-entry systems , in particular - it would then have the complete package of engineering solutions needed to take people into space and bring them back safely .
Europe 's space ministers will be asked to consider such ideas at their meeting in November .

Blue areas show volume loss picked up by computer
Experts taught a standard computer how to diagnose Alzheimer 's from brain scans , and got a 96 % success rate .
The accuracy of diagnosis from standard scans , blood tests and interviews carried out by a clinician is 85 % .
The findings , published in the journal Brain , could lead to earlier diagnosis and more successful treatment of dementias , say scientists .
Researchers from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London say computers have several advantages for diagnosing Alzheimer 's - a condition caused by the build - up of plaques and tangles of tissue in the brain .
From the point of view of developing new pharmaceuticals for these disorders there 's great potential
Prof Richard Frackowiak
Professor Richard Frackowiak said the computers were better able to distinguish signs of Alzheimer 's than humans , and proved cheaper , faster and more accurate than current methods .
" It 's beginning to look like it will have to come into clinical practice , " he said .
" Machines are clearly able to do that sort of thing better . "
The method involves teaching a standard computer the difference between brain scans from patients with proven Alzheimer 's disease and people with no signs of the disease at all .
The two conditions can be distinguished with a high degree of accuracy on a single clinical MRI scan without the need for time consuming follow - up tests , say the scientists .
They think the technique will be particularly useful for reassuring elderly people with mild memory loss that they are not suffering from Alzheimer 's disease .
It may also allow researchers to study progression of the disease in a patient , and perhaps eventually lead to a way of screening new drugs .
" In the long - run , we 'd like to use these techniques as ways of classifying patients with something like a degenerative disease into various stages , " explained Professor Frackowiak .
" From the point - of - view of developing new pharmaceuticals for these disorders there 's great potential , " he added .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Cosmic rays are so dangerous and so poorly understood that people are unlikely to get to Mars or even back to the moon until better ways are found to protect astronauts , experts said on Monday .

And NASA is not properly funding the right experiments to find out how , the National Research Council committee said .
“ One of the big issues is they have really cut funding for biology issues , ” retired space shuttle astronaut James van Hoften , who chaired the committee , said in a telephone interview .
“ It is tough on them when they do n’t have any new money coming in .
They are using old data , ” he added -- including research done on survivors of the nuclear bombings of Japan during World War Two .
“ Given today ’s knowledge and today ’s understanding of radiation protection , to put someone out in that type of environment would violate the current requirements that NASA has . ”
The committee of experts agreed that NASA ’S existing radiation safety standards can protect astronauts and they urged the U.S. space agency to keep them in place .
The Earth ’s bulk , atmosphere and magnetic field protect life from the solar radiation and the cosmic rays that travel through space .
Astronauts have just a thin layer of shielding .
Van Hoften knows from personal experience .
“ My introduction to space radiation came first - hand as a crew member aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger in April 1984 .
‘ What the heck was that ? ’
I blurted out after seeing what looked like a white laser passing quickly through my eyes , ” van Hoften wrote in the introduction to the report .
“ ‘ Oh , that ’s just cosmic rays , ’ said Pinky Nelson , my spacewalking partner and space physicist .
The thought of extremely high - energy particles originating from a distant cosmic event passing easily through the space shuttle and subsequently through my head made me think that this can not be all that healthy .
The truth of the matter is that it is not . ”
NOWHERE TO HIDE
The cosmic rays include galactic cosmic radiation or GCR and solar particles .
“ You can put on very thick walls and they just wo n’t protect you from that , ” van Hoften said .
“ The younger you are the worse it is , ” he added , because as with many types of radiation , it can take years for the damage to cause disease .
“ It might be OK if you just send a bunch of old guys like me , ” he laughed .
Any mission to Mars using current technology would take three years , van Hoften said .
That long in space would subject astronauts to too much radiation .
“ It has n’t really gotten the airing that it needs .
In the committee we stewed over this for a long time before we said anything , ” he added .
Ejections of dangerous particles from the sun can be forecast , but astronauts must hide in specially shielded areas of shuttles or space stations and may miss important tasks , the committee said .
Adding more shielding can make spacecraft too heavy and is too expensive , added the report from the council , one of the independent National Academies of Science that advises the federal government .
The report , commissioned by NASA ’s Exploration Systems Mission Directorate , said the radiation poses cancer and other health risks for years after astronauts return to Earth .
“ The committee finds that lack of knowledge about the biological effects of and responses to space radiation is the single most important factor limiting prediction of radiation risk associated with human space exploration , ” the report reads .
Dock Phillip Ellis ’ voice reveals how much pain he is in .
The former pitcher speaks slowly , haltingly about his battle with cirrhosis of the liver .
“ It ’s pretty bad , ” Ellis said in a phone interview last week .
“ I spend more time itching than anything because that goes with the cirrhosis .
I just try to take it slow . ”
The 63 - year - old does not have much choice .
Since being diagnosed the day after Thanksgiving , Ellis has deteriorated rapidly .
He spends most of his days lying in bed or on the couch of his Apple Valley , Calif . home .
He no longer can drive and the disease has wiped him out .
“ He ’s fatigued at all times and he ’s lost his appetite , ” Ellis ’ wife of 23 years , Hjordis , said .
“ I ’ve watched my husband lose over 60 pounds since November .
He has very serious bouts of delusion .
He ’s very emotional and he cries a lot .
That ’s something I never thought I ’d see . ”
Ellis pitched 12 years in the big leagues , including stints with the Yankees and Mets .
He is best known for his time with the Pittsburgh Pirates , helping the Bucs win the 1971 World Series with a 19 - 9 record .
Ellis never fit the model of a ballplayer with his outspoken and outlandish behavior .
He spoke up for the rights of black players and fought for free agency .
He also infamously pitched a no-hitter while on LSD and showed up in the dugout one day with curlers in his hair .
He battled alcoholism until 1980 when he checked into rehab and kicked the habit .
Ellis went on to become a drug counselor .
His old habit may have caught up to him , though , last Thanksgiving when he began shaking and having delusions during the family ’s dinner .
“ I was shaking like a leaf , bobbing and weaving like Joe Frazier , ” Ellis said with a chuckle .
“ I did n’t know who I was . ”
Ellis went to a local hospital and was diagnosed .
Complicating matters , Ellis had started a new job and was without health insurance .
The Ellis ’ now question if they received the best treatment because the hospital knew he would n’t be able to pay his bills .
“ The most difficult part is when he gets sick and I take him to hospital and once they find out he does n’t have insurance , the lack of concern and care , ” Hjordis said .
“ You can witness a change .
There have been times when he ’s been very ill , and they ’ve basically kicked him out of the hospital . ”
A few of Ellis ’ friends , led by David Reich , the son of his former agent Tom Reich , have tried to change that .
They brought Ellis to UCLA Medical Center recently and Reich paid for his exams .
If Ellis is found to be healthy enough , he could be placed on a liver transplant list in the upcoming weeks .
Reich has enlisted the help of Hall of Famer Joe Morgan , who is on the board of the Baseball Assistance Team ( B.A.T. ) .
Along with executive director Jim Martin , Morgan and B.A.T. have begun to help Ellis .
Yankees president Randy Levine also has given Ellis a commitment that the team he helped lead to the 1976 American League pennant will aid him .
Hjordis has taken a leave of absence to care for her husband .
All the couple can do now is wait and hope that he can have a transplant .
“ I do n’t think most people are understanding the severity of the illness , ” Hjordis said .
“ It ’s a matter of life and death with him now . ”

Prepare for a new breed of cognitive , thinking robots .
Photo : COSPAL
Designers of artificial cognitive systems have tended to adopt one of two approaches to building robots that can think for themselves : classical rule - based artificial intelligence or artificial neural networks .
Both have advantages and disadvantages , and combining the two offers the best of both worlds , say a team of European researchers who have developed a new breed of cognitive , learning robot that goes beyond the state of the art .
The researchers ’ work brings together the two distinct but mutually supportive technologies that have been used to develop artificial cognitive systems ( ACS ) for different purposes .
The classical approach to artificial intelligence ( AI ) relies on a rule - based system in which the designer largely supplies the knowledge and scene representations , making the robot follow a decision - making process – much like climbing through the branches of a tree – toward a predefined response .
Biologically inspired artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) , on the other hand , rely on processing continuous signals and a non-linear optimisation process to reach a response which , due to the lack of preset rules , requires developers to carefully balance the system constraints and its freedom to act autonomously .
“ Developing systems in classical AI is essentially a top - down approach , whereas in ANN it is a bottom - up approach , ” explains Michael Felsberg , a researcher at the Computer Vision Laboratory of Linköping University in Sweden .
“ The problem is that , used individually , these systems have major shortcomings when it comes to developing advanced ACS architectures .
ANN is too trivial to solve complex tasks , while classical AI cannot solve them if it has not been pre-programmed to do so . ”
Beyond the state of the art
Working in the EU - funded COSPAL project , Felsberg ’s team found that using the two technologies together solves many of those issues .
In what the researchers believe to be the most advanced example of such a system developed anywhere in the world , they used ANN to handle the low - level functions based on the visual input their robots received and then employed classical AI on top of that in a supervisory function .
“ In this way , we found it was possible for the robots to explore the world around them through direct interaction , create ways to act in it and then control their actions in accordance .
This combines the advantages of classical AI , which is superior when it comes to functions akin to human rationality , and the advantages of ANN , which is superior at performing tasks for which humans would use their subconscious , things like basic motor skills and low - level cognitive tasks , ” notes Felsberg .
The most important difference between the COSPAL approach and what had been the state of the art is that the researchers ’
ACS is scalable .
It is able to learn by itself and can solve increasingly complex tasks with no additional programming .
“ There is a direct mapping from the visual precepts to performing the action , ” Felsberg confirms .
“ With previous systems , if something in the environment changed that the low - level system was not programmed to recognise , it would give random responses but the supervising AI process would not realise anything was wrong .
With our approach , the system realises something is different and if its actions do not result in success it tries something else , ” the project coordinator explains .
“ Like training a child or a puppy ”
This trial - and - error learning approach was tested by making the COSPAL robot complete a shape - sorting puzzle , but without telling it what it had to do .
As it tried to fit pegs into holes it gradually learnt what would fit where , allowing it to complete the puzzle more quickly and accurately each time .
“ After visual bootstrapping , the only human input was from an operator who had two buttons , one to tell the robot it was successful and another to tell it that it had made a mistake .
It is much like training a child or a puppy , ” Felsberg says .
Though a learning , cognitive robot of the kind developed in COSPAL constitutes an important leap forward toward the development of more autonomous robots , Felsberg says it will be some time before robots gain anything close to human cognition and intelligence , if they ever do .
“ In human terms , our robot is probably like a two or three year old child , and it will take a long time for the technology to progress into the equivalent of adulthood .
I do n’t think we will see it in our lifetimes , ” he says .
Nonetheless , robots like those developed in COSPAL will undoubtedly start to play a greater role in our lives .
The project partners are in the process of launching a follow - up project called DIPLECS to test their ACS architecture in a car .
It will be used to make the vehicle cognitive and aware of its surroundings , creating an artificial co-pilot to increase safety no matter the weather , road or traffic conditions .
“ In the real world you need a system that is capable of adapting to unforeseen circumstances , and that is the greatest accomplishment of our ACS , ” Felsberg notes .
COSPAL series : Part 1 of 2 .
The second part will be published on 27 March .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China accused Tibetan groups on Tuesday of planning suicide attacks following last month ’s riots and protests but did not answer key questions about its evidence for such allegations .
A spokesman told a news conference in Beijing that police had seized guns , bullets and explosives in some Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and repeated the accusation that the Dalai Lama was linked to Tibetan groups that had organised the recent unrest .
An aide to the Dalai Lama immediately denied what he called “ baseless ” allegations , and the U.S. State Department said the Dalai Lama was a man of peace who wanted only to talk to China .
At the same time , China ’s anti-riot force was issued a mobilization order to ensure a trouble - free Beijing Olympic Games in the wake of the anti-Chinese unrest across Tibetan areas .
The Dalai Lama ’s representatives in India , where he has lived in exile since 1959 , have denied Beijing ’s charges of his complicity in deadly riots that swept Tibet ’s regional capital on March 14 and urged Beijing to allow an international probe .
But China ’s Ministry of Public Security said it had arrested “ key members ” of an underground network in Lhasa working in concert with overseas pro-Tibet independence groups to spark a “ Tibet People ’s Uprising Movement ” .
“ We now have sufficient evidence to prove that the Lhasa incident is part of the Tibetan People ’s Uprising Movement organized by the Dalai clique .
Its purpose is to create crisis in China by staging coordinated sabotage activities , ” ministry spokesman Wu Heping told the news conference .
“ To our knowledge , the next plan of the Tibet independence forces is to organize suicide squads to launch violent attacks . ”
Wu linked the recent unrest with gatherings of Tibetan rights groups last year and in January , saying that the Tibetan Youth Congress and other participants set down a blueprint to disrupt the Olympics and stir insurrection in Tibetan areas .
“ They reached agreement after consulting with high - level leaders in the Dalai clique , ” Wu said .
Pressed to give the names of arrested suspects , or to say whether China wants to extradite and try the exiled Dalai Lama -- winner of a Nobel Peace Prize -- for the alleged crimes , spokesman
Wu backed off into generalities about “ rule of law ” .
He also would not give details of the supposed plans for suicide attacks , instead referring to his claims of weapons seizures in monasteries .
The United States rejected the allegations that the Dalai Lama was involved in plotting any kind of violence .

“ The Dalai Lama is a man of peace .
There is absolutely no indication that he wants to do anything other than have a dialogue with China to discuss how to deal with some of the serious issues there , ” said State Department spokesman Tom Casey , when asked about China ’s claims .
He reiterated a U.S. call for China to engage in a dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
“ We continue to urge the Chinese government to exercise restraint in terms of dealing with any protests that are out there , ” Casey added .

EXPLOSIVES
Wu said that investigators had seized 176 guns , 13,013 bullets and 3,504 kilograms of explosives , but did not say where .
“ The Dalai Lama was in fact an energizing force in guiding this movement , ” he said .
Tenzin Taklha , a senior aide of the Dalai Lama , said China should stop making baseless allegations , take a realistic look at the grievances of the Tibetan people and engage in dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
“ Again , the Chinese are trying to portray that we Tibetans are instigating violence and now they are talking about suicide squads and we strongly deny these allegations , ” he said .
Some foreign leaders , including U.S. President George W. Bush , have urged China to talk to the Dalai Lama to resolve the crisis , but China has been pressing foreign governments to avoid contact with him .
The Dalai Lama will make a brief stopover in Japan en route to the United States from India next week , upsetting China .
“ We have all along opposed him using any excuse or in any capacity going to any country to engage in separatist activities , ” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said .
In India , where the Dalai Lama and many of his followers have lived since 1959 when they fled China , Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee urged the Dalai Lama not to indulge in political activities that hurt its ties with China .
On Sunday , China ’s most senior foreign policy official , Dai Bingguo , called Indian National Security Adviser M.K. Narayanan to explain China ’s position on the anti-government unrest .
There were more protests on Tuesday in neighboring Nepal , where at least 87 Tibetan protesters were detained when they tried to storm the Chinese embassy in the capital , police said .
ON THE first Tuesday of every May ( it 's May 6 , this year ) the citizens of Brookline make a belated acknowledgment of Thomas Jefferson 's birthday ( it 's April 13 , every year ) .
They go to the polls .
Brookline , like 50 other New England towns , is governed by a representative town meeting .
Each town meeting member is elected by his precinct - his neighbors .

Using parasite fighters ( an aircraft intended to be carried into a combat zone by a larger aircraft ) is an old idea .
The first parasite fighters were carried aboard military airships .
Several plans were drawn up to outfit Zeppelin - type dirigible airships to launch and recover fighters .
USS Akron and her sister ship USS Macon were regarded as potential " flying aircraft carriers " , carrying parasite fighters for reconnaissance use .
During the 1930s , the Soviet Union developed a parasite aircraft project called
One of the more interesting experiments undertaken to extend the range of the early jets in order to give fighter protection to piston - engineed bombers , was the provision for in - flight attachment / detachment of fighter to bomber
On April 24 , 1953 , a F - 84 flopped over onto the wing of a B - 29 and both crashed with loss of all on board personnel .
The project was cancelled .

The Convair B - 36 ( nicknamed Peacemaker ) was the largest mass - produced piston engined aircraft ever made and the largest combat aircraft ever built .
With a range of over 6,000 miles , some of these aircrafts needed special protection , so they were employed in " parasite " programs in which the B - 36 carried smaller interceptors or reconnaissance aircraft .
The FICON ( Fighter Conveyor ) program was conducted by the United States Air Force in the 1950s to test the feasibility of a B - 36 Peacemaker bomber carrying an F - 84 parasite fighter in its bomb bay .
A production B - 36 Peacemaker was modified with a special trapeze mechanism in its bomb bay , and a production F - 84E Thunderjet was fitted with a retractable hook in the nose in front of the cockpit .

The first parasite fighters were carried aboard military airships .
Several plans were drawn up to outfit Zeppelin - type dirigible airships to launch and recover fighters .
USS Akron and her sister ship USS Macon were regarded as potential " flying aircraft carriers " , carrying parasite fighters for reconnaissance use .
During the 1930s , the Soviet Union developed a parasite aircraft project called Zveno .
It consisted of a Tupolev TB - 1 or a Tupolev TB - 3 heavy bomber acting as a mothership for between two and five fighters .
Depending on the Zveno variant , the fighters either launched with the mothership or docked in flight , and they could refuel from the bomber .
It is estimated that Zveno - SPB flew at least 30 combat missions .
One of the more interesting experiments undertaken to extend the range of the early jets in order to give fighter protection to piston - engineed bombers , was the provision for in - flight attachment / detachment of fighter to bomber via wingtip connections .
One of the several programs during these experiments was done with a B - 29 mother ship and two F - 84D " children " , and was code named " Tip Tow . "
On April 24 , 1953 , a F - 84 flopped over onto the wing of a B - 29 and both crashed with loss of all on board personnel .
The project was cancelled .

In life , one mystery gives way , revealing a new one underneath , waiting to be solved .
An early mystery was genes .
Scientists did not know what hidden factor lurked inside living things , giving rise to their traits and traveling from parent to child to recreate those traits anew .
The answer , of course , turned out to be DNA : Segments of the molecule encode the proteins and RNA molecules that carry out the work of life , send signals , capture energy and build biomass .
But it quickly became clear that just having genes was not the full secret of life .
The genes need to become active at the right time and place .
Think about it : Each one of your cells contains genes that can produce hair and toenails , and can crank out neurotransmitters and digestive enzymes .
If all your genes did churn away , your body would become a hideous , useless jumble .
Our life depends on the courteous restraint of our genes .
In the late 1950s , French scientists discovered how genes are restrained .
They wanted to know why the microbe E. coli sometimes made enzymes for feeding on lactose ( the sugar in milk ) , and why sometimes it did n't .
The scientists demonstrated that E. coli uses three genes to feed on lactose , and all three are lined up next to each other in the microbe 's DNA .
They also discovered that the three genes can all be shut down at once .
A special protein latches onto a distinctive bit of DNA near the genes , blocking the molecules that would read their genetic recipes .
If the repressing protein is pried away , the genes switch on .
All living things , ourselves included , turn genes on and off in a similar way , by making switch - like proteins called transcription factors .
And as scientists have identified more of these , they 've discovered something remarkable :
They form a chain of command .
The job of some transcription factors is to switch others on and off , and they in turn are controlled by other transcription factors .
Even a seemingly simple microbe like E. coli has an impressive hierarchy .
Just nine genes rule over about half of the 4,000 - odd genes in E. coli .
E. coli's network allows it to respond quickly to the challenges it meets , from starvation to heat to the loss of oxygen .
It can rapidly reorganize itself , switching on hundreds of genes and switching off hundreds of others .
What makes this network all the more impressive are the feedback loops that keep it from spinning out of control .
When one gene switches on , for example , it may make a protein that shuts down the gene that switched it on in the first place .
Yet even as scientists uncover this network , they discover yet another mystery .
In the latest issue of Nature , scientists reported an experiment in which they wreaked havoc with E. coli's network .
They randomly added new links between the transcription factors at the top of the microbe 's hierarchy .
Now a transcription factor could turn on another one that it never had before .
The scientists randomly rewired the network in 598 different ways and then stepped back to see what happened to the bacteria .
You might expect that they all died .
After all , if you were to pop open the back of an iPod and start linking its components together in random ways , you 'd expect it to crash .
But that 's not what happened .
About 95 percent of the rewired bacteria did just fine with their new networks .
They went on with their lives , feeding , growing and dividing .
Some even performed better than microbes with the original wiring , under some conditions .
The tolerance these bacteria showed reveals something important about how evolution works .
Humans can randomly rewire cells , and so can mutations .
There 's something about gene networks that allow them to thrive despite these mutations , and , in some cases , to even gain an edge in the evolutionary race .
But scientists do n't quite know why a network like the one in E. coli can handle this rewiring so well .
The source of their strength lies not in a single molecule – DNA – but in a complicated web of relationships .
The network itself is the mystery for biologists in the 21st century .

LAST Friday ’s election in Iran – like every vote there since the 1979 revo lution – violated fundamental Islamic principles .
But , then , so does the so - called Islamic Republic of Iran itself .
No one can become a candidate in Iran without the approval of a body known as the Council of Guardians .
The regime , in other words , does n’t trust individual Iranian Muslims to uphold Islamic principles in their political choices .
Yet the fundamental principle of individual personal responsibility – which can never be abdicated or delegated – is one of the most striking recurring themes in the Koran .
Various schools within Islam put different emphases on this duty , but having a council of fallible humans negate the free will of Muslim citizens is totalitarianism – not Islam .
Thus , the “ Islamic Republic ” is neither Islamic nor a republic .
The authoritarianism of such institutions as the Council of Guardians is supposedly justified as necessary for preserving “ the Islamicity of the state ” – a goal that is claimed as another teaching of the Koran .
That , too , is false .
The claim that a state can be Islamic is false from a religious point of view and has no support in 15 centuries of Islamic history .
There is no mention whatsoever of the state in the Koran .
Islam does not prescribe any form of government .
Rather , the teachings of Mohammed emphasize the community of Muslims and each Muslim ’s responsibility for conducting public affairs .
True , Muslims everywhere , whether a majority or minority of the populace , are bound to observe sharia as a matter of religious obligation .
But this can be best achieved when the state is neutral regarding all religious doctrines .
Any principle of sharia that has been enacted into state law , simply because it is a principle of sharia , is no longer religious – for Muslims would then be observing the law of the state as such and not freely performing their religious duty as Muslims .
( This does not , of course , prevent a Muslim from supporting , say , laws against pornography or prostitution on the basis of his or her moral beliefs .
But , then , the same holds for citizens of other faiths . )
The notion of an Islamic state is in fact a postcolonial innovation in the thinking of some Muslims – an “ import ” of a European model of the state and of a totalitarian view of law and public policy .
In essence , then , today ’s Iranian system is no different from the former Soviet and Nazi regimes – or from the Arab nationalist Ba’ath dictatorship in Syria ( and formerly in Iraq ) .
That the repression comes in the name of religion does n’t make it any less totalitarian .
A true and valid return to Islamic values , in Iran and elsewhere , requires allowing individuals to practice religion unfettered by political leaders who claim to speak in the name of the Divine .
This is the clear demand of Muslims everywhere .
Consider “ Who Speaks for Islam , ” a survey , published in February by Gallup , of 50,000 Muslims in more than 35 countries .
A clear majority of those polled said they do n’t want religious leaders to draft their constitutions .
The survey also confirms that large majorities of Muslims want to protect free speech and reject attacks on civilians as morally wrong .
It also found Muslim women demanding equality and respect for their human dignity .
Gallup did find a majority of Muslims saying they want sharia to be a source of legislation and religion to have an important role in their societies .
Plainly , much great public awareness is needed of such concepts as the inherently secular nature of the state and the critical role of the principles of constitutionalism , human rights and citizenship .
Islamic beliefs , as with any other religious and philosophical principles , will unavoidably have some connection with politics .
But a proper understanding of the Koran ’s teachings can regulate that connection – indeed show the necessity for separation of sharia and state .
The question is how to transform attitudes of Muslims on these issues .
Human - rights advocates should , of course , speak out about the Iranian election and call it what it is – a mockery of democracy .
Just as important , however , Muslims must speak out .
The “ religious ” state that the Iran ’s ruling clique hopes to perpetuate in Iran is , in fact , a form of heresy – completely antithetical to Islam ’s true teachings .
As a Muslim , I demand – and the Koran promises – the right to practice my religion freely .
Abdullahi Ahmed An - Na’im is a law professor at Emory University and author of “ Islam and the Secular State : Negotiating the Future of Sharia . ”
premium_icon Cats premiership push from every angle
Aussie rules
The Broadbeach Cats will have the chance to break a 24 - year senior premiership drought on Saturday when they play Morningside in the QAFL grand final at Yeronga .
Here are all the storylines you need to know heading into the game following our sit down with senior coach Craig O’Brien .
The US 's Transportation Security Administration has announced some good news for aficionados of nipple piercings - they will no longer have to remove them with pliers before boarding internal flights .
The policy review came shortly after 37 - year - old Mandi Hamlin fell foul of a handheld metal detector in Lubbock , Texas , while trying to catch a plane to Dallas on 24 February .
The device sucessfully detected two jub accessories , and Hamlin was ordered to remove them .
She was whisked behind a curtain and while the first piercing - a metal bar - slipped out without protest , her nipple ring proved a little more stubborn .
Hamlin was quickly reduced to tears and , when handed a pair of pliers to dislodge the offending metalwork , claimed she heard " male TSA agents snicker as she took out the ring " .
Cue the obligatory press conference and demands for an apology , although the TSA claimed its operatives " properly followed procedures in that incident " and further supported " the thoroughness of the Officers involved as they were acting to protect the passengers and crews of the flights departing Lubbock that day " .
However , the TSA late last week updated its statement to read : " TSA has reviewed the procedures themselves and agrees that they need to be changed .
In the future TSA will inform passengers that they have the option to resolve the alarm through a visual inspection of the article in lieu of removing the item in question .
" TSA acknowledges that our procedures caused difficulty for the passenger involved and regrets the situation in which she found herself .
We appreciate her raising awareness on this issue and we are changing the procedures to ensure that this does not happen again . "
In celebration of this attack of good sense , we at El Reg have had a quick whip - round and will offer a hearty night in our favourite hostelry to the first male reader who turns up at Lubbock bearing a " Prince Albert " and demands a visual inspection .

A poll carried out in nine countries -- the United States , Britain , Germany , France , the Netherlands , Russia , Italy , Spain and Poland -- also showed Americans were most willing to donate money to spread the message of the Bible .
The poll for the Catholic Biblical Federation interviewed Christians and non-Christians ahead of a synod of Roman Catholic Bishops on the Bible due to be held at the Vatican in October .
Most respondents in the poll , which was presented at the Vatican , were Christian .
Except for in the United States , Britain and Russia , most of the Christians respondents were Catholic .
Asked if they had read a phrase from the Bible in the past 12 months , 75 percents of American respondents said yes , while between 20 percent and 38 percent of respondents in the other eight countries said yes .
The lowest were Spain with 20 percent , France with 21 percent , Italy with 27 percent , and Germany with 28 percent .
Results were similar when respondents were asked if they had read a book with a religious theme in the past 12 months .
Fifty - eight percent of Americans said yes .
Poland was second with 50 percent and the other countries came in between 22 and 35 percent .
The poll , taken by the GFK - Eurisko research group , showed Americans prayed the most ( 87 percent ) and the French the least ( 49 percent ) .
Americans , Britons , Dutch , Germans , Spaniards , Poles and Russian tended to pray “ with my own words ” whereas Italians and French tended to recite prayers they had memorized .
Germany and the Netherlands had the highest percentage of respondents who said they believed the Bible was not divinely inspired but just “ an ancient book made up of legends , historical facts and teachings written by man ” .
The majority of respondents in all countries believed it was either the direct word of God or inspired by God .
Americans were the largest group who said they had a Bible at home ( 93 percent ) and the French were the lowest ( 48 percent ) .
The French were the most opposed to teaching the Bible in schools whereas the Americans were split about evenly .
Poland had the highest percentage of those who said they attended religious services regularly ( 91 percent ) , followed by the United States with 77 percent and Russia with 75 percent .

IN 1784 , Benjamin Franklin composed a satire , “ Essay on Daylight Saving , ” proposing a law that would oblige Parisians to get up an hour earlier in summer .
By putting the daylight to better use , he reasoned , they ’d save a good deal of money  96 million livres tournois  that might otherwise go to buying candles .
Now this switch to daylight saving time ( which occurs early Sunday in the United States ) is an annual ritual in Western countries .
Even more influential has been something else Franklin said about time in the same year : time is money .
He meant this only as a gentle reminder not to “ sit idle ” for half the day .
He might be dismayed if he could see how literally , and self - destructively , we take his metaphor today .
Our society is obsessed as never before with making every single minute count .
People even apply the language of banking :
We speak of “ having ” and “ saving ” and “ investing ” and “ wasting ” it .
But the quest to spend time the way we do money is doomed to failure , because the time we experience bears little relation to time as read on a clock .
The brain creates its own time , and it is this inner time , not clock time , that guides our actions .
In the space of an hour , we can accomplish a great deal  or very little .
Inner time is linked to activity .
When we do nothing , and nothing happens around us , we ’re unable to track time .
In 1962 , Michel Siffre , a French geologist , confined himself in a dark cave and discovered that he lost his sense of time .
Emerging after what he had calculated were 45 days , he was startled to find that a full 61 days had elapsed .
The images coming down from the STS - 123 mission have been nothing short of spectacular .
The pictures have included amazing EVA shots , images of the astronauts hard at work ( and having fun , too ) and stunning photos of the ever - growing International Space Station .
Here are just a few of the latest images from the mission , and they ’re all so great , I ’ve decided to give each one an award .
This one gets the award for Best Group Photo Ever of the Shuttle , ISS and Earth .
On Monday , shuttle Endeavour undocked from the ISS , and after the obligatory fly - around , the astronauts snapped this picture as the shuttle separated from the station .
In my mind , this is one of the most amazing images from space ever .
And there ’s more ….
This image gets the award for Best Color Contrast Image of the ISS .
Backdropped by the airglow of Earth ’s horizon and the blackness of space , the ISS hangs on Earth ’s limb .
What an awesome view that must be live and in person .
Obviously , this image gets the Best Moon Photo for the STS - 123 Mission .
Talk about being in the right place at the right time !
Framed by different components of the International Space Station , a full moon is visible in this view above Earth ’s horizon and airglow .
I ’d like to give credit where credit is due and say which astronaut snapped this image , but NASA only says the picture was taken by an STS - 123 crewmember who was on the station while Space Shuttle Endeavour was docked with the ISS .
This has to be one of the Best Aurora Picture Ever Taken From Space .
I ’m still trying to wrap my brain around having the chance to look down to see an aurora .
The Aurora Borealis glows beautifully green in this images that looks northward across the Gulf of Alaska , over a low pressure area ( cloud vortex ) .
This image was taken on March 21 , 2008 at 09:08:46 ( GMT ) with a 28 mm lens from the nadir point of 47.9 degrees north latitude and 146.8 degreees west longitude .
Let ’s give a round of applause for the crews of STS - 123 and the ISS who accomplished so much during the mission with five EVA ’s , adding the Japanese Logistics Module to the station and constructing Dextre the robot handyman .
Plus they are responsible for all the great images from the mission , too .
Shuttle Endeavor will attempt to land on Wednesday , March 26 at 7:05:08 p.m EDT .
As of now , the weather looks good for landing in Florida .
Pictured are Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko , US astronauts Greg Johnson , Rick Linnehan , Garrett Reisman , Dom Gorie , Peggy Whitson , Mike Foreman , Bob Behnken , European astronaut Leopold Eyharts , and Japanese astronaut Takeo Doi .

The Army is accustomed to protecting classified information .
But when it comes to the planning for the Iraq war , even an unclassified assessment can acquire the status of a state secret .
That is what happened to a detailed study of the planning for postwar Iraq prepared for the Army by the RAND Corporation , a federally financed center that conducts research for the military .
After 18 months of research , RAND submitted a report in the summer of 2005 called “ Rebuilding Iraq . ” RAND researchers provided an unclassified version of the report along with a secret one , hoping that its publication would contribute to the public debate on how to prepare for future conflicts .
But the study ’s wide - ranging critique of the White House , the Defense Department and other government agencies was a concern for Army generals , and the Army has sought to keep the report under lock and key .
A review of the lengthy report – a draft of which was obtained by The New York Times – shows that it identified problems with nearly every organization that had a role in planning the war .
That assessment parallels the verdicts of numerous former officials and independent analysts .
The study chided President Bush – and by implication Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who served as national security adviser when the war was planned – as having failed to resolve differences among rival agencies .
“ Throughout the planning process , tensions between the Defense Department and the State Department were never mediated by the president or his staff , ” it said .

REUTERS /DigitalGlobe / Handout
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Syria on Thursday dismissed U.S. accusations that North Korea was helping it build a nuclear reactor that could produce plutonium .
Syria ’s ambassador to Britain , Sami al - Khiyami , told Reuters that the accusation , which President George W. Bush ’s administration was expected to lay out to lawmakers on Thursday , was to put pressure on North Korea in talks about Pyongyang ’s nuclear program .
“ This has nothing to do with North Korea and Syria .
They just want to exert more pressure on North Korea .
This is why they are coming up with this story , ” Khiyami said .
“ This is political manipulation ahead of the talks with North Korea to exert more pressure on them . ”
Khiyami was speaking before what a U.S. official said would be evidence regarding Syria - North Korea nuclear cooperation to be put to lawmakers in Washington on Thursday .
The White House has said little about the possibility of such cooperation between the two since Israel conducted a mysterious September 6 air strike on Syria that media reports said targeted a nuclear site being built with Pyongyang ’s help .
Painstaking academic research indicates that promiscuous oral sex can carry a higher risk of throat cancer than smoking or boozing .
A report based on a hospital study of 100 oropharyngeal cancer sufferers and 200 controls , carried out by Johns Hopkins scientists , appeared today in the New England Journal of Medicine .
In it , the splendidly - named Dr Gypsyamber D'Souza and her co-authors make some noteworthy conclusions .
" A high lifetime number of vaginal - sex partners ( 26 or more ) was associated with oropharyngeal cancer , " the boffins wrote .
It 's hard to say what that really means in terms of rumpy - associated risk ; but El Reg suggests that it does offer at least one piece of concrete info .
Namely , that if you are a Johns Hopkins scientist , chances are you have done it with significantly less than 26 people .
According to the scientists , oral sex is a vastly more dangerous business than plain - vanilla rogering , with just six or more partners required to increase the danger of throat cancer .
Again it seemed that the Johns Hopkins crew had perhaps led relatively quiet lives , as they considered that half - a- dozen was a " high " final score .
The increased multipartner - jigjig throat cancer risk was due to the likelihood of becoming infected with human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , thought to be implicated in various kinds of cancer including the cervical variety .
The study appeared to suggest that throat - cancer risks from booze and cigs were insignificant compared to those from getting too frisky .
Of course , that does n't mean that drink and baccy are safer than the other things you might - in this context - put in your mouth .
Oral sex does n't ( as far we as we know ) cause liver failure or lung cancer .
So do n't log off that swingers ' site and rush out for a sixpack or 20 Bensons just yet .
On the face of it , however , this really is excellent news for cigar fanciers , who seldom breathe the fumes of their chosen weed into their lungs and so avoid many of the risks faced by aficionados of the smaller , more economical paper - wrapped smoke .
One of cigar - lovers ' primary risks is that of cancer in the throat or mouth ; and it now appears that this danger is actually insignificant .
Of course , certain circumstances leap to mind in which this might not be true .
It seems possible that former US President Bill Clinton may be reading the New England Journal of Medicine with close attention this afternoon . ®

Nuclear power is the logical step up in energy density from dung , wood , coal , oil ... , but its scaling has been controversial and uncertain .
Below is an overview of both the nuclear fuel cycle and its energy return .
Please add your comments , links and expertise in a manner that Prof Goose is fond of saying , ' that would improve the silence ' ...;-)
The concept of an energy theory of value has been around since ( at least ) the 1930s and net energy actually became part of law after Mark Hatfield petitioned Congress in 1970 regarding the importance of EROI .
His efforts resulted in the passing of ( now defunct ) Public Law 93.577 which stipulated that all prospective energy supply technologies considered for commercial application must be assessed and evaluated in terms of their ‘ potential for production of net energy ” .
However , insurmountable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the energy unit to understand , a ) the conversion among disparate fuel types ( energy quality ) , b ) the contribution of the environment , and c ) the boundaries of analysis .
Despite these problems , energy analysis is grounded ( largely ) in physical principles , which gives it an important long term edge over financial analysis which may proximately be related to real things , but ultimately is related to the political will to print money .
This is 4th in a continuing series of articles by Professor Charles Hall of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and his students , describing the energy statistic , " EROI " for various fuels .

INTRODUCTION
Definition : Nuclear power refers to the controlled use of nuclear fission reactions to release energy captured for use in electricity generation .

TECHNOLOGY
Light Water Reactors ( LWRs ) :
Figure 2 – Nuclear Fuel Chain ( Leeuwen 2005 ) .
Click to Enlarge .
All commercial reactors in the US are variants of light water reactors , either Pressurized Water Reactors , or Boiling Water Reactors , and are known as Generation II reactors ( EIA 2007 ) .
Thus plants constructed in the short and medium term can only be incrementally different from current designs .
Generation III and III + reactors ( which any new reactors built in the US will be ) incorporate new safety features and standardized designs .
It takes years to get regulatory approval for new reactor designs .
Standardization , such as has been done in France , lowers costs substantially .
Passive safety features activate through physical means , with little or no electricity and no human operators are necessary , increasing reliability in extreme traumas .
Breeders
Breeders are plants that use excess radiation to generate new fuels , with the combination of new LWR reactors could increase the amount of energy extracted from fissionable resources by 100 times ( Martinez - Val 2007 ) .
Figure 3 – General breeder cycle ( Leeuwen 2005 ) .

RESOURCE BASE
As noted in Proops ( 2001 ) and elsewhere , and shown in Figure 2 , the nuclear fuel cycle is simple , and basically similar to the fossil fuel cycle .
As can be the case with coal , the EROI and energy and economic balances in general seem to be highly dependent on ore - quality .
Uranium
Uranium can come in several types of deposits , with different energy requirements for extraction from each .
Figure 4 – Available uranium in the world ( WISE 2007 ) .
Click to Enlarge .
At current use rates , the known resources are enough to last for 70 years , although changes in price and technology can affect the economically recoverable resources available ( Hore - Lacy 2006 ) .
As with other mineral resources the average grade of uranium has declined substantially over time as the best reserves have been depleted .
The average grade mined also is very sensitive to the mining rate , and the mean grade declines substantially when the rate of extraction increases for society ( Hall et al. 1986 ) .
Not much research , with the exception of Leeuwen ( 2005 ) , has been done on the effect of net energy with regards to these decreasing quality deposits , which will be used when uranium increases in price .
Figure 5 – Available uranium as a function of resource / ore type ( Leeuwen 2005 ) .
Click to Enlarge .
As extraction and depletion have operated over time , the average ore grade has decreased and the uranium has become more and more dispersed within the background substrate , plus the total amount of uranium we can extract can decrease as well .
Leuwen ( 2005 ) argues that the empirical extraction yield declines much more sharply than the hypothetical one , which could come into play if there is a large increase in nuclear capacity in the coming decades .
Figure 6 – % of Uranium Extracted from Ore as a Function of Ore Grade ( Leeuwen 2005 ) .
Click to Enlarge .
An increasing portion of the world ’s uranium comes from in - situ leaching ( ISL ) ( Hore - Lacy 2007 ) .
Figure 7 – In Situ Leaching ( WISE 2007 ) .
Click to Enlarge .
With ISL oxygenated groundwater is circulated through a porous ore - body to dissolve the Uranium and bring it to the surface .
This should help the energy balance , as much less materials are being moved around , although it is unclear how concentrated ( what grade ) the ore must be .
Seawater
Uranium salts exist in seawater at low concentrations , as is the case for essentially every other element , and hence can be extracted from the massive total supplies in seawater .
Some scientists in Japan are considering this , although according to at least one source , extraction of uranium from seawater would cost much more energy than contained in the uranium itself ( Leeuwen 2006 ) .
EROI
We have found the information about the EROI of nuclear power to be mostly as disparate , widespread , idiosyncratic , prejudiced and poorly documented as information about the nuclear power industry itself .
Much , perhaps most , of the information that is available seems to have been prepared by someone who has made up his or her mind one - way or another ( i.e. a large or trivial supplier of net energy ) before the analysis is given .
As is usually the case , the largest issue is often what the appropriate boundaries of analysis should be .
The following diagram , which should be considered conceptually if not necessarily quantitatively appropriate , illustrates the main issues .
The diagram indicates from left to right the timeline of a power plant , with the initial negative values ( “ phase 1 ” ) indicating the initial energy costs of plant construction , the large positive value generated over the reactor ’s lifetime ( with a correction for the energy to get / refine the fuel ) and phase 3 indicating the energy required for dismantling the plant and sequestering the dangerous by products .
Figure 8 – Lifecycle view of energy costs and production ( Leeuwen 2005 ) .
The above figure is a general outline of the energy costs and gains lifecycle , but does not accurately reflect the operational lifetime ( which is more likely to be around 50 years ) or the EROI ( which depends on the study looked at ) .
Click to Enlarge .
The seemingly most reliable information on EROI is quite old and is summarized in chapter 12 of Hall et al. ( 1986 ) .
Newer information tends to fall into the wildly optimistic camp ( high EROI , e.g. 10:1 or more , sometimes wildly more ) or the extremely pessimistic ( low or even negative EROI ) camp ( Tyner et al .
1998 , Tyner 2002 , Fleay 2006 and Caldicamp 2006 ) .
One recent PhD analysis from Sweden undertook an emergy analysis ( a kind of comprehensive energy analysis including all environmental inputs and quality corrections as per Howard Odum ) and found an emergy return on emergy invested of 11:1 ( with a high quality factor for electricity ) but it was not possible to undertake an energy analysis from the data presented ( Kindburg , 2007 ) .
Nevertheless that final number is similar to many of the older analyses when a quality correction is included .
Figure 9 . EROI for nuclear power plotted vs. year of analysis .
( Source Robert Powers ) .
Click to Enlarge .
Tyner was the author ( or co-author ) on the 1988 and 1997 reports which are examples of the lower EROI numbers -- less than 5:1 .
Tyner ’s 1997 paper reported an “ optimistic value ” of 3.84 and a “ less- optimistic ” value of 1.86 and may be based on “ pessimistic ” cost estimates .
For example capital monetary costs were 2.5 times higher than those reported for Generation III and III + plants ( Bruce Power 2007 , see below ) .
Fleay ’s 2006 on line paper at least gives very detailed numerical analyses of costs and gains and hence probably can be checked explicitly .
Different boundaries are used for these “ low EROI ” studies than most other recent studies that effect the results .
For example Tyner takes interest ( with a 4 - 5 x larger energy cost magnitude than capital energy costs ) into account in EROI ( Tyner 1997 ) .
The two large EROI values reported here were for nuclear lifecycles which used centrifuge fuel enrichment as opposed to diffusion - based enrichment .
Centrifuge enrichment uses much less electricity than other methods ( Global Security 2007 ) .
We do not know how to interpret these analyses because centrifugal separation is an old technology .
Newer rotor materials allow more rapid rotor spin which might influence results .
At present much of the enriched uranium used for nuclear power is coming from dismantled nuclear warheads from the US - Russian agreement to decrease nuclear warheads but , apparently , that program will soon come to an end and we will have to contemplate again generating nuclear power from mined uranium .
Much of the arguments about the great or small potential of future nuclear power comes from those who argue about the importance of technology vs. those who focus on depletion .
As usual , however , technology is in a race with depletion and the winner can be determined only from empirical analysis , of which there seems to be far too little .
Charles
Hall inserts :
As an example of the disparity in information “ out there ” I quote the following from the responses to our earlier posting of the balloon graph on the web : ( From mkwin ) : …….. A recent study I read from Melbourne University quantified the EROEI from the Forsmark Plant in France as 93:1 .
Source : http://nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/TheBenefitsOfNuclearPower
How can there be such a discrepancy ( with the balloon graph ) ?
This discrepancy on the EROEI figure for nuclear has to be clarified as one of the most urgent energy issue .
( a reply was posted by Chris ) :
There is a large discrepancy because the report you read is intentionally deceptive .
Their goal is to hide carbon emissions associated with nuclear power so when they calculate the EROEI they hide the energy needed to enrich the uranium .
This is currently the largest energy input .
France devotes the entire output of three reactors to enrichment so the EROEI of their program should be around 7 or less …..
( Charles Hall stupidly gave the critics ammunition by extrapolating from that number to all reactors in France ) .
Charles Barton added later :
If I were researching EROEI , I would identify who in India might be helpful in identifying information that would lead to an understanding of the EROEI of the Indian fuel cycle .
If I were looking for information you might start with the Indian Department of Atomic Energy .
http://www.dae.gov.in/
I would also suggest contacting the AECL of Canada , to get a picture of the EROEI of the CANDU reactor .
http://www.aecl.ca/site3.aspx
I understand your frustration but your assumption that you can get a good picture of the EROEI of the nuclear Industry by a literature review and a meta - analysis will lead to a distorted and inaccurate picture .
As I told you my interest in establishing a basis of comparison between competing or potentially competing nuclear power systems .
If you only analyze the EROEI of one system , and ignore the existence of other systems in Canada , and India , you will leave yourself open to criticism , and not just to me .
So , dear reader , take your pick .
I am not technically qualified to judge from all these differing perspectives .
Please send any hard analyses you may have .
We need a really good review by a committee of qualified people with few axes to grind .
I leave you with one thought my mother told me long ago : caveat emptor .
ECONOMICS
There has been a general upward trend in the cost ( in inflation - corrected dollars ) of constructing a new nuclear power plant in the U.S. , although there has not been a new plant completed for decades .
Plant Costs
Figure 10 – Historical Capital Costs per KW of Nuclear Capacity Installed Over Time
In the US
Click to Enlarge .
Bruce Power ( 2007 ) gives cost estimates for new plant construction ( no subsidies included ) as --- $ 1,000 - 1,100 / KW for a Westinghouse AP1000 and $ 1,160 -1,250 / KW for a GE ESBWR .
These costs are significantly lower than historical trends , and no plants with these designs have been completed yet in the US , so it remains to be seen if these cost projections are accurate .
In general as the price of oil has increased so has the cost of just about everything .
Another unresolved issue is that of government subsidies .
Proops ( 2001 ) lays out three main types : subsidies from the military nuclear industry , non-military government subsidies , and artificially low insurance .
In the US the initial expenditure on uranium enrichment plants was exclusively from military budgets , so for these commercial plants the capital costs were written off .
The figures for direct government subsidies are hard to come by , however billions have been spent by the government directly and through grants on nuclear power R&D ( Proops 2001 ) .
In addition , the US government has pledged to cover up to $ 500 million in cost overruns due to regulatory delays for the first 2 new nuclear plants built , and half that for the next 4 ( Energy Policy Act of 2005 ) .
There are also funds to cover the Nuclear Power 2010 Program , “ a joint government / industry cost - shared effort to identify sites for new nuclear power plants , develop and bring to market advanced nuclear plant technologies , evaluate the business case for building new nuclear power plants , and demonstrate untested regulatory processes ” ( DOE 2007 ) .
The longest standing , and perhaps most important , direct subsidy for nuclear power in the US is the Price - Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act .
This act artificially maintains low insurance costs with “ no - fault ” insurance for operators .
The first ten -billion dollars of damage from a major disaster would be covered by the nuclear industry ( not solely the operator ) , and above that the government up the tab .
Thus the nuclear industry in the USA has had to bear only a small proportion of the risk , the rest is assumed by the state or imposed as an uncovered risk on the public ( Proops 2001 ) .
If commercial plants had to cover the full risks , such as the human , environmental and property damages from a major accident or terrorist attack , nuclear power would be extremely uneconomic ( Proops 2001 ) .
In unsubsidized markets there are many natural - gas plants being built but not a single new nuclear plant , suggesting unsubsidized returns are not competitive with similar sized fossil - fuel plants ( Proops 2001 )
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
As in any large heavy industry there are substantial environmental impacts of operating the nuclear fuel cycle .
Although the accidental release of radiation has received the largest attention , ( even there have been no such deaths in the U.S. from more than 50 years of nuclear power ) , there are far more actual fatalities from the routine mining and processing of the material that will eventually enter a plant .
The same perhaps could be said about environmental impact although no such overview exists to our knowledge .
We next look at the impacts at each stage :
Mining
Open pit uranium mining has similar environmental impacts to other forms of open - pit mining , such as ecosystem removal or physical disruption , dust .
leachates entering into water supplies and so on .
In all uranium mining ( except , perhaps , in situ leaching tailings are a major issue .
While the leachates themselves are relatively low in radioactivity , the sheer amount of tailings ( usually 100 - 1000 x the amount of uranium extracted ) make them a major issue ( Anawa 2007 ) .
Radiation - emitting particles can leech into groundwater , or dried tailings from soft ores can be carried by wind and deposited on plants .
The most serious ( human ) issue is lung cancer from inhaling uranium decay products ( Anawa 2007 ) .
Plant Operation
Accidents causing small to large releases of radiation can occur impacting either the local environment ( in the case of a small loss of primary coolant ) or much larger geographic areas ( as was the case with the plume of radioactive fallout from Chernobyl ) .
Large accidents also have the possibility of making huge areas of land uninhabitable , as was also the case for the area surrounding Chernobyl were over 300 thousand people were moved and resettled .
There is production of radioactive waste from routine plant operation .
These include : Low - level waste ( such as tools used in the reactor , containment suits , used piping , etc ) which are often dealt with on site , typically by burying for several years until it is not significantly radioactive anymore ( Fentiman 2007 ) .
High - level waste includes materials such as spent fuel , and is much more radioactive and difficult to deal with .
It must be stored on site for several years to cool down before the possibility of moving it to a geological repository is considered .
Waste Storage
Waste from nuclear reactors can contain lethal doses of radiation for thousands of years .
The best known way to deal with waste is to store it in a geological repository , deep underground .
Currently Yucca Mountain , Nevada is the only site being developed or investigated as a repository in the US , and is scheduled to begin accepting waste in 2017 .
More repositories will be needed especially if the use of nuclear power is expanded in the US .
Even then , over tens of thousands of years waste could possibly leak into the water table .
Again the issue is controversial even after extremely expensive and extensive analyses by the U.S. Department of Energy .
SOCIAL IMPACTS
People around the plant
While no one living near a nuclear power plant in the US has been killed accidents are an ever present fear and risk for those living near current power plants .
Plants are also targets for terrorist attacks .
New designs greatly reduce the probability of serious events associated with plants , but not necessarily the perception of high risk around plants .
Nuclear proliferation
Main fear in the US is that spent fuel will be stolen for use in a ‘ dirty bomb . ’
Yucca Mountain
The area surrounding Yucca Mountain has traditionally been holy lands of the Western Shoshone , Southern Paiute , and Owens Valley Paiute and Shoshone peoples who arenaturally not enthusiastic about the construction or operation of the facility .
CONCLUSION
There are great potential gains and great potential costs with nuclear power .
Existing reactors seems to work well and mostly safely although waste disposal problems remain .
If the uranium resource limitation people are correct then we cannot go much further without a new technology , perhaps based on thorium .
Various issues related to terrorism are more important than they used to be .
Earlier “ new technologies ” such as Breeders ( Clinch River , Super Phoenix ) have been abandoned as too expensive .
Plumbing issues have plagued the Candu style reactors , although they appear intrinsically cheaper and safer and do not require energy - intensive enrichment .
Fusion is still many decades away .
So there is no free lunch with nuclear .
Nevertheless it is possible that nuclear fission should be considered as a transition fuel on our way to solar or something else simply because the cycle emits far less CO2 than does any fossil fuel .
In our opinion we need a very high level series of analyses to review all of these issues .
Even if this is done it seems extremely likely that very strong opinions , both positive and negative , shall remain .
There may be no resolution to the nuclear question that will be politically viable .

Li Qun Roast Duck Restaurant in Beijing gets its birds from a farm outside the city .
They arrive dead because live ducks are not allowed in the capital .
The ducks are reared for about 40 days , and slaughtered the night before being delivered to Zhang Li Qun 's eatery .
The BBC ’s Michael Bristow visited Mr Zhang 's restaurant to find out how one of China 's most famous dishes , Peking Duck , is created .
Microsoft CFO
Chris Liddell thinks he knows why Microsoft shares have gotten hammered so hard in recent months .
And that reason is Yahoo .
In an internal interview today , Liddell was asked to comment on the stock 's lagging performance .
Liddell boils it down to three major factors :
" [ It 's ] our own performance , but more particularly general economic performance . . . and the Yahoo situation [ .]
And I think until the Yahoo situation clarifies itself one way or another , it 's going to be an overhang on our price , " Liddell said in the interview .
One can only assume that Liddell was asked to comment on the stock price in a semi-public forum because employees are freaked out about losing their savings on a rotten Yahoo deal .
And with the looming Saturday deadline – the day by which Microsoft has threatened to go hostile if it does n't have an agreement with Yahoo – Liddell interestingly again brought up the possibility of walking away .
" We made a decision almost three weeks ago to send a letter saying , ' Hey , it 's time to move on ' . . .
And if we do n't consummate a transaction or make significant progress by then , I think we 've signaled very publicly , we 'll think about our alternatives .
And our alternatives then are to try to facilitate a transaction , to possibly go directly to Yahoo shareholders .
Or to walk away and go back to our original organic strategy .
We 'll see what next week brings , " Liddell said .

There will be no international boycott of the Olympics in Beijing .
By the time the Games are over , however , even the Chinese Government might be wishing that its country had never been chosen to host them .
The disruption yesterday by pro-Tibetan demonstrators of the Athens launch of the Olympic torch relay is just the first trickle of what will become a tidal wave of embarrassment for the colonial Communist rulers of the ancient Buddhist kingdom of Tibet .
In fact , the Chinese Government will be fortunate if it is only the Tibetan independence movement which seeks to exploit the intense media focus on Beijing as the 29th Games draws near .
A preview of the possibilities was provided at the ceremony three months ago launching China Central Television 's coverage of the 2008 Olympics .
A popular Beijing newscaster , Hu Ziwei , grabbed the microphone and stunned the audience – not to mention millions of viewers – by shouting repeatedly , " If the Chinese have no humane values to present to the world , what is the purpose of the Olympics after all ? "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Hu was jailed on charges of " damaging the name of China and the Olympic Games " .
We are told that she will be released when the Games are safely over ; but the difficulty for the rulers in Beijing is that there will be protesters whose identities even their immense domestic intelligence services will not have been able to ascertain .
This problem is by no means peculiar to the People 's Republic of China in the year 2008 .
The Olympics have long been a focus for spectacular displays of political opposition .
Forty years ago , the run-up to the Mexico City Games was characterised by rioting against the Government of Gustavo Ordaz : 10 days before the Games started there was what amounted to a massacre in Mexico City , when hundreds of demonstrators were shot by the police and military .
This , however , was before the days of 24 - hour news television : its impact was minimal compared to what would ensue if something similar happened in Beijing this summer .
In 1972 , West Germany would have had the highest hopes when Munich held the Games : it seemed a glorious opportunity to eradicate the memories of the only previous occasion on which Germany was the host – in 1936 , under the rule of the Nazis .
Instead , it had to endure the public horror of the " Munich Massacre " in which 12 Israeli athletes were slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists .
This is the " event " for which the 1972 Olympics is most remembered – by everyone except track and field anoraks .
Most terrifyingly for the occupants of Beijing 's Zhong Nan Hai , it was probably the presence of the international media which lay behind the timing of the student protests of 1989 .
The Tiananmen Square massacre has rather obliterated the outside world 's memories of what happened immediately beforehand : it was the occasion of the first visit of a Russian leader since the Sino - Soviet split in the 1960s .
The world 's news media had flown in to Beijing to broadcast the encounters between the charismatic reformist Mikhail Gorbachev and the gerontocrats of the Chinese Communist Party .
The students could see that this was an opportunity to demonstrate to the world their demands for similar reforms in their own country – a demonstration suppressed with a brutality that only underlined the Chinese Communist Party 's almost pathological inability to cope with any genuine form of political opposition .
A similar inability has disfigured Beijing 's handling of Tibet .
The 72 - year old Dalai Lama long ago abandoned the idea of achieving independence for his people : his demands do not go much further than advocacy of some sort of cultural autonomy .
Far from calling for a boycott of the Olympics , he has actually criticised those who have pressed for such an ostracisation of Beijing .
Yet the Chinese Communists have continued to denounce the old man with the vehemence and the language which in earlier years they applied to such mortal enemies as Chiang - Kai Shek .
Thus the Beijing - appointed Communist Party chief in Tibet , Zhang Qingli , has spent much of his three years in the job hurling gratuitous insults at the Dalai Lama .
This month he described the Tibetan spiritual leader as " a wolf in monk 's robes , a devil with a human face , but the heart of a beast " .
On the same occasion , he told officials that " we are now engaged in a fierce blood - and - fire battle with the Dalai clique , a life and death battle between us and the enemy " .
Zhang does not just use this sort of language to inspire the necessary vigour among Communist Party officials : in an interview two years ago with the German magazine Spiegel , he denounced the Dalai Lama 's followers in these terms :
" Those who do not love their country are not qualified to be human beings .
This is a matter of commonsense . "
Zhang 's inflammatory rhetoric is not , of course , the worst thing that the Tibetan people have had to endure .
While it is true that the Tibetans might well be materially better off under the Communists than ruled by a God-King , the extirpation of an entire culture causes pain and anger that cannot be assuaged by the existence of a new railway line , or sports centre .
Beijing has offered Han Chinese great incentives to settle in Tibet – including an exemption from the one - child policy for those who marry Tibetans .
The result has been a resettlement which threatens to make Tibetans a minority in their own so - called " autonomous region " .
This fear of cultural annihilation doubtless lies behind the ugly rioting in Lhasa and elsewhere , which has seen the trashing and burning of Han Chinese shops – and , indeed , murders .
It is both pathetic and predictable that it is only physical violence on the part of the Tibetans that has galvanised Western leaders ( with the honourable exception of Angela Merkel ) into some sort of rhetorical action .
This was summed up pretty well by a Tibetan exile in Dharamsala last week , who told a reporter how her 21 - day hunger strike in front of the UN building in New York had achieved nothing .
Well , have you ever heard of Dolma Choephel ?
Ms Choephel , of the Central Committee of Tibetan Youth , told Spiegel with some bitterness : " The world only reacts to violence – when a bomb explodes or a house goes up in flames . "
It was inevitable that the Chinese refusal to deal with the peaceful demands of the Dalai Lama led to a situation in which his own people have started to advocate violent resistance .
Alas for those angry young Tibetans , the Chinese can utter the words made famous by the BBC 's invented master - race , the Daleks : " resistance is futile " .
The terrible truth is that they are probably right .
No matter what demonstrations are mounted during the Beijing Olympics , no matter how much attention the outside world pays – when the Games are over , the Tibetans will continue their state - sponsored slide into oblivion .

Sex for money , not love / Violet Blue asks rising adult superstar Lorelei Lee about the differences between sex work and sex not - for - work
Lorelei Lee glows .
Not simply because her hair is a halo of sunshine blond , her eyes a clear liquid gaze , or because all of her features combine uniquely to make her a stunning young woman — natural body and all .
Lorelei Lee smiles .
A lot .
And in porn , that 's a rarity .
Lee is a local girl porn performer who's hit the mainstream with impact , but she prefers to work and play close to home .
The last time I saw her in person , she was onstage at Femina Potens reading excerpts from her memoirs .
Her passages were perfect pieces of prose that made me lose track of time and get lost in the rhythm and cadence of her reading , told between big smiles , even when painful in topic .
Lee was telling us about her poetry scholarship , the boyfriend who spent it all , her first steps into porn , and her mother 's ever - evolving , frenetic reactions .
I was impressed with her writing .
It 's exactly this space that fascinates : the story behind the sex work .
A young woman 's first decision to have sex for money , not love .
Every story is different ; every woman has her reasons why .
How each individual sex worker navigates sex for money is unique .
Even though I am not a porn performer , I am often asked by total strangers how to " get into porn . "
I tell them I do n't really know but to see who 's hiring , to expect risks , to be physically fit , and to be absolutely certain that they can have sex and not require cuddling or any aftercare .
I never know the motivations or stories behind the question , and I can only answer as a spectator .
I need cuddling — vibrators are worthless at snuggling — so I 'm not really qualified .
That 's one of the reasons I was happy to talk to Lee .
With an aura that keeps your eyes on her no matter where she 's at in a room or onscreen , as well as her penchant for extreme onscreen activities , I knew she could best describe the terrain .
Violet Blue :
Is being a porn performer easy ?
Lorelei Lee : OK , my first answer is that no matter what the actual job is like , " being a porn performer " is , in many ways , pretty much as difficult as " being a gay person " in terms of the ways it affects your life and your interactions in the world .
That is , it might be easier ( still perhaps not " easy " ) for the few people who have really great support networks and really amazing , understanding friends and families , but for most people it is relatively difficult .
In terms of the actual job itself ...
Once in a while I 've had a really easy day in which I go to work , get my make - up done , shoot a simple gonzo scene with an easy set - up and I 'm showered and on my way home in four hours .
But most of the time it does n't work that way .
VB : What 's the biggest misconception you encounter about the job ?
LL : I think there 's a big misconception that working in porn is somehow easier than doing other kinds of work .
I think that there is a mythology that says that porn performers " just have sex " and that the sex we have at work is somehow the same as sex that anyone might have at home .
First of all , porn sex is not the same as private sex .
The biggest difference is that , at work , a performer 's personal pleasure is not of primary importance .
Of course , the job is easier and the finished product is often sexier if the performers are enjoying themselves .
But that enjoyment — when it happens — usually happens in spite of a lot of other concerns and pleasure obstacles .
VB : Like what ?
LL : Early morning call times — how many people really feel sexy at 7:00 in the morning ?
I suppose there must be a few people , but they are n't me .
Tedious pre-scene preparation .
Long 10 - 12 hour days .
Scene partners who we may not get along with or be attracted to , or , who may be less hygienic than we 'd like .
Demanding , highly critical and / or unsympathetic directors ( imagine being yelled at , criticized and / or ordered around by your boss while you are trying to act and feel sexy ) .
Aerobic and highly performative sex in positions that may be uncomfortable and / or awkward and may far outlast one 's capability for arousal .
" Cuts , " " holds , " camera angles and hot , glaring , unflattering lights .
Tons and tons of just waiting around .
I imagine that being a porn performer is similar to being a kind of athlete .
In that capacity , you have to perform on schedule and under demanding conditions .
A big part of the job is being reliable regardless of if you have a headache or a pulled muscle or your period or you 're having a fight with your boyfriend or girlfriend , or you just do n't feel sexy .
VB : How does a performer distinguish between sex work and sex - not - for - work ?
LL : I think every sex worker has a different idea about the answer to this question — people seem to have very individualized physical and emotional boundaries and processes of compartmentalization .
Some people choose to only perform certain acts on camera , in order to save something for their personal lives or for their significant others .
Some women I know who primarily date men decide to only have sex with women on camera .
Some women I know who primarily date women , decide to only have sex with men on camera .
Personally , I do n't choose to draw that line in terms of physical acts , but rather , I have an emotional boundary between work sex and personal sex .
That is , work sex , for me , is not an intimate experience .
I do n't choose to become vulnerable or emotionally open while I 'm having sex at work .
I enjoy having sex at work , and I often have affectionate feelings for the people I work with — many of them are my good friends — but I do n't expect them to react to me in a vulnerable or emotionally intimate way and I do n't react to them in a vulnerable or emotionally intimate way .
I 'm not sure that I have good advice about how to do this , because I do think that strategies for this are entirely individual , but I also think it comes back to the importance of remembering what you will and wo n't get from a day at work .
You will get a certain kind of attention for a limited amount of time and you are likely to get an intense physical experience .
You are far less likely to get that attention for any extended period of time or to develop a romantic and / or emotionally intimate relationship with your co-workers .
Even though you are having sex with some of the people you work with , you are still likely ( perhaps advisedly , considering the prospects of your continued employment ) to have a somewhat formal working relationship with them .
VB : What does a girl need to know if she wants to get into porn ?
LL : First of all , it 's a good idea to have some idea of what you want to get out of your work in porn .
Are you looking to make a specific amount of money ?
Have a certain kind of experience ?
Gain a certain kind of attention ?
Is this something you want to do for the short term or the long term ( remembering , of course , that porn careers , like all athletic careers , become more difficult to maintain as you get older ) ?
A good place to find more advice is AIM - med.org .
They have great informational videos for new performers .
In general , the porn industry is not a good place to get famous .
It is not even a good place to go if what you are looking for is a certain kind of attention .
You will get positive sexual attention , praise , etc. ( to a degree that can become overwhelming very quickly and can begin to seem false and / or one - dimensional ) , but you will also get negative feedback and negative attention .
Remember that you will be making images of your body public in a way that you have very little control over — as many flattering , glamorous images will be published as unflattering , badly lit , poorly angled , awkwardly positioned images .
Many people will think you are a beautiful , sexy goddess and they will write this on the Internet , they will send you MySpace marriage proposals and every other kind of proposition .
Just as many people will look at you as an unfeeling , degraded , lesser person because you 've chosen to do this work ; they will say every mean thing that you can think of .
People who you have never met will make their opinions about you publicly known on Internet forums and they will send you crude and occasionally explicitly cruel MySpace messages .
It 's important to have a plan for dealing with all of this attention , both positive and negative .
Having a solid support system of friends who are both in the industry and outside of the industry is crucial .
Think about your limits before you start — what do you want and not want to do on camera ?
Remember that if you say you will perform a certain act , you will be expected to perform that act .
Do n't say you can or will do something if you are not sure whether you can or want to do it .
It 's no fun for anyone if someone on set seems to be uncomfortable or in physical pain , or seems to be pushing themselves to do something they 'd rather not .
In general , no one ( directors , other performers , porn viewers ) wants you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable — it does n't make for good movies , for one thing .
If you decide , for example , that you want to perform in an anal sex scene , it 's a good idea to make sure you are practiced and comfortable with having anal sex — remembering that you are likely to be working with men who are inordinately well - endowed .
If you think no one will find out about your job , you 're wrong .
Your friends will find out .
Your significant other will find out .
Your family will find out .
I promise you .
Have a plan for how you want to deal with this .
( Would you rather tell them first ?
Would you rather wait and deal with it when it happens ?
What / how will you tell them ? )
I think that the happiest performers have other things going on in their lives that have nothing to do with porn .
If you are comfortable with your body and comfortable with having public sex , the porn industry is a good place to make a lot of money very quickly .
Particularly if you are n't used to making money this way , it 's really important to have some kind of financial plan , remembering that as an independent contractor , your next paycheck is never guaranteed .
It 's good to be prepared for slow periods and periods when you might need to take breaks .
Burnout happens to everyone .
You will also need to be prepared to pay your taxes — keep detailed records of all of your work expenses .
For the first time in your life you will get to write off both lipstick and enema bottles .

Just one example of the lengths to which foreigners will go to stay on good terms with Nazarbayev is the current negotiation between a consortium of Western energy giants , including ENI and Exxon , and Kazakhstan ’s state - run oil company over the development of the Caspian ’s massive Kashagan oil field .
At present , the consortium is coughing up at least $ 4 billion as well as a large hand - over of shares to compensate for delayed exploration and production  and Kazakhstan is n’t satisfied yet .
The lesson from Kazakhstan , and its equally strategic but far less predictable neighbor Uzbekistan , is how fickle the second world can be , its alignments changing on a whim and causing headaches and ripple effects in all directions .
To be distracted elsewhere or to lack sufficient personnel on the ground can make the difference between winning and losing a major round of the new great game .

The Big Three dynamic is not just some distant contest by which America ensures its ability to dictate affairs on the other side of the globe .
Globalization has brought the geopolitical marketplace straight to America ’s backyard , rapidly eroding the two - centuries - old Monroe Doctrine in the process .
In truth , America called the shots in Latin America only when its southern neighbors lacked any vision of their own .
Now they have at least two non-American challengers : China and Chávez .
It was Simón Bolívar who fought ferociously for South America ’s independence from Spanish rule , and today it is the newly renamed Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela that has inspired an entire continent to bootstrap its way into the global balance of power on its own terms .
Hugo Chávez , the country ’s clownish colonel , may last for decades to come or may die by the gun , but either way , he has called America ’s bluff and won , changing the rules of North - South relations in the Western hemisphere .
He has emboldened and bankrolled leftist leaders across the continent , helped Argentina and others pay back and boot out the I.M.F. and sponsored a continentwide bartering scheme of oil , cattle , wheat and civil servants , reminding even those who despise him that they can stand up to the great Northern power .
Chávez stands not only on the ladder of high oil prices .
He relies on tacit support from Europe and hardheaded intrusion from China , the former still the country ’s largest investor and the latter feverishly repairing Venezuela ’s dilapidated oil rigs while building its own refineries .
But Chávez ’s challenge to the United States is , in inspiration , ideological , whereas the second - world shift is really structural .
Even with Chávez still in power , it is Brazil that is reappearing as South America ’s natural leader .
Alongside India and South Africa , Brazil has led the charge in global trade negotiations , sticking it to the U.S. on its steel tariffs and to Europe on its agricultural subsidies .
Geographically , Brazil is nearly as close to Europe as to America and is as keen to build cars and airplanes for Europe as it is to export soy to the U.S. Furthermore , Brazil , although a loyal American ally in the cold war , wasted little time before declaring a “ strategic alliance ” with China .
Their economies are remarkably complementary , with Brazil shipping iron ore , timber , zinc , beef , milk and soybeans to China and China investing in Brazil ’s hydroelectric dams , steel mills and shoe factories .
Both China and Brazil ’s ambitions may soon alter the very geography of their relations , with Brazil leading an effort to construct a Trans - Oceanic Highway from the Amazon through Peru to the Pacific Coast , facilitating access for Chinese shipping tankers .
Latin America has mostly been a geopolitical afterthought over the centuries , but in the 21st century , all resources will be competed for , and none are too far away .
The Middle East  spanning from Morocco to Iran  lies between the hubs of influence of the Big Three and has the largest number of second - world swing states .
No doubt the thaw with Libya , brokered by America and Britain after Muammar el - Qaddafi declared he would abandon his country ’s nuclear pursuits in 2003 , was partly motivated by growing demand for energy from a close Mediterranean neighbor .
But Qaddafi is not selling out .
He and his advisers have astutely parceled out production sharing agreements to a balanced assortment of American , European , Chinese and other Asian oil giants .
Mindful of the history of Western oil companies ’ exploitation of Arabia , he  like Chávez in Venezuela and Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan  has also cleverly ratcheted up the pressure on foreigners to share more revenue with the regime by tweaking contracts , rounding numbers liberally and threatening expropriation .
What I find in virtually every Arab country is not such nationalism , however , but rather a new Arabism aimed at spreading oil wealth within the Arab world rather than depositing it in the United States as in past oil booms .
And as Egypt , Syria and other Arab states receive greater investment from the Persian Gulf and start spending more on their own , they , too , become increasingly important second - world players who can thwart the U.S .
Saudi Arabia , for quite some years to come still the planet ’s leading oil producer , is a second - world prize on par with Russia and equally up for grabs .
For the past several decades , America ’s share of the foreign direct investment into the kingdom decisively shaped the country ’s foreign policy , but today the monarchy is far wiser , luring Europe and Asia to bring their investment shares toward a third each .
Saudi Arabia has engaged Europe in an evolving Persian Gulf free - trade area , while it has invested close to $ 1 billion in Chinese oil refineries .
Make no mistake : America was never all powerful only because of its military dominance ; strategic leverage must have an economic basis .
A major common denominator among key second - world countries is the need for each of the Big Three to put its money where its mouth is .
For all its historical antagonism with Saudi Arabia , Iran is playing the same swing - state game .
Its diplomacy has not only managed to create discord among the U.S. and E.U. on sanctions ; it has also courted China , nurturing a relationship that goes back to the Silk Road .
Today Iran represents the final square in China ’s hopscotch maneuvering to reach the Persian Gulf overland without relying on the narrow Straits of Malacca .
Already China has signed a multibillion - dollar contract for natural gas from Iran ’s immense North Pars field , another one for construction of oil terminals on the Caspian Sea and yet another to extend the Tehran metro  and it has boosted shipment of ballistic - missile technology and air - defense radars to Iran .
Several years of negotiation culminated in December with Sinopec sealing a deal to develop the Yadavaran oil field , with more investments from China ( and others ) sure to follow .
The longer International Atomic Energy Agency negotiations drag on , the more likely it becomes that Iran will indeed be able to stay afloat without Western investment because of backing from China and from its second - world friends  without giving any ground to the West .
America 's most senior general was " hoodwinked " by top Bush administration officials determined to push through aggressive interrogation techniques of terror suspects held at Guantánamo Bay , leading to the US military abandoning its age - old ban on the cruel and inhumane treatment of prisoners , the Guardian reveals today .
General Richard Myers , chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff from 2001 to 2005 , wrongly believed that inmates at Guantánamo and other prisons were protected by the Geneva conventions and from abuse tantamount to torture .
The way he was duped by senior officials in Washington , who believed the Geneva conventions and other traditional safeguards were out of date , is disclosed in a devastating account of their role , extracts of which appear in today 's Guardian .
In his new book , Torture Team , Philippe Sands QC , professor of law at University College London , reveals that :
· Senior Bush administration figures pushed through previously outlawed measures with the aid of inexperienced military officials at Guantánamo .
· Myers believes he was a victim of " intrigue " by top lawyers at the department of justice , the office of vice - president Dick Cheney , and at Donald Rumsfeld 's defence department .
· The Guantánamo lawyers charged with devising interrogation techniques were inspired by the exploits of Jack Bauer in the American TV series 24 .
· Myers wrongly believed interrogation techniques had been taken from the army 's field manual .
The lawyers , all political appointees , who pushed through the interrogation techniques were Alberto Gonzales , David Addington and William Haynes .
Also involved were Doug Feith , Rumsfeld 's under - secretary for policy , and Jay Bybee and John Yoo , two assistant attorney generals .
The revelations have sparked a fierce response in the US from those familiar with the contents of the book , and who are determined to establish accountability for the way the Bush administration violated international and domestic law by sanctioning prisoner abuse and torture .
The Bush administration has tried to explain away the ill - treatment of detainees at Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq by blaming junior officials .
Sands ' book establishes that pressure for aggressive and cruel treatment of detainees came from the top and was sanctioned by the most senior lawyers .
Myers was one top official who did not understand the implications of what was being done .
Sands , who spent three hours with the former general , says he was " confused " about the decisions that were taken .
Myers mistakenly believed that new techniques recommended by Haynes and authorised by Rumsfeld in December 2002 for use by the military at Guantánamo had been taken from the US army field manual .
They included hooding , sensory deprivation , and physical and mental abuse .
" As we worked through the list of techniques , Myers became increasingly hesitant and troubled , " writes Sands .
" Haynes and Rumsfeld had been able to run rings around him . "
Myers and his closest advisers were cut out of the decision - making process .
He did not know that Bush administration officials were changing the rules allowing interrogation techniques , including the use of dogs , amounting to torture .
" We never authorised torture , we just did n't , not what we would do , " Myers said .
Sands comments : " He really had taken his eye off the ball ... he did n't ask too many questions ... and kept his distance from the decision - making process . "
Larry Wilkerson , a former army officer and chief of staff to Colin Powell , US secretary of state at the time , told the Guardian : " I do know that Rumsfeld had neutralised the chairman [ Myers ] in many significant ways .
" The secretary did this by cutting [ Myers ] out of important communications , meetings , deliberations and plans .
" At the end of the day , however , Dick Myers was not a very powerful chairman in the first place , one reason Rumsfeld recommended him for the job " .
He added : " Haynes , Feith , Yoo , Bybee , Gonzalez and - at the apex - Addington , should never travel outside the US , except perhaps to Saudi Arabia and Israel .
They broke the law ; they violated their professional ethical code .
In future , some government may build the case necessary to prosecute them in a foreign court , or in an international court . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Already - battered U.S. auto sales could be the next victim of the problems with mortgages , declining home and stock prices as potential car buyers delay purchases due to uncertainty .
Industrywide U.S. auto sales in August could be off 10 percent from a year ago , according to an early read from sales tracker Edmunds.com .
That follows July sales that were 19 percent below year - earlier levels .

Jesse Toprak , executive director of industry analysis for Edmunds.com , said that the downturn in home values and credit issues that were seen in the July numbers could be an even bigger factor this month .
" I think the issue is becoming more pronounced , " he said .
Sales were n't just weak at domestic automakers , such as General Motors ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Ford Motor ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler Group .
Year - over - year sales fell in July at Toyota Motor ( Charts ) and Honda Motor ( Charts ) as well .
Many forecasters are cutting full - year auto sales targets in the face of these weak summer sales .
And some experts say the turmoil in housing could throw even more dirt in the gears .
CNW Research , which specializes in surveys of car buyers , found in its latest reading that 13.6 percent of the potential market 's customers were canceling or postponing plans to make a new - vehicle acquisition any time soon , up from 10.1 percent last year .
And of those postponing or canceling plans , home - related issues jumped to the No. 1 reason , cited by 17.6 percent of those staying away from dealers ' showrooms , with nearly 11 percent of that group citing a decline in their home equity and another 6 percent citing an increase in their monthly home payment .
Of those postponing purchases , 10.7 percent cited problems with credit scores , as some sources of car loans are tightening lending standards .
Gas prices are a distant third , cited by less than 5 percent of those delaying purchases .
" We 're probably going to see some pretty bad [ auto sales ] numbers for the rest of the year , " said Art Spinella , president of CNW .
" To put it simply , housing is now the major hurdle to new car purchases .
The next three to four months are not going to be much better if it 's better at all .
People are not interested in buying a new vehicle . "
Only two years ago , the CNW survey found just 2.3 percent citing home - related issues as a reason to postpone a car purchase , while 5 percent cited credit score problems and about 3 percent cited gas prices .
Automakers , led by GM , are upping cash - back offers and other inducements to try to breathe life into sales in the face of headlines about home foreclosures and market meltdowns .
GM spokesman John McDonald said that GM is n't seeing any sharp drop - off in sales it can trace to the current mortgage and housing slowdown .
" It is one of a number of headwinds , " he said .
" There 's fuel prices , there 's interest rates and there 's housing prices .
But we 're not seeing anything new that we 've not been talking about for more than a year . "
But one auto industry executive , who spoke on condition that his name not be used , said that the higher incentive spending by automakers , particularly on GM pickups , may mask some of the bite that housing is putting on sales .
" The home was not only a source of financing for some car purchases , it contributes to a positive feeling psychologically , " said the executive .
" That led to a confident outlook , a view that ' I can go ahead and spend from paycheck to paycheck and buy new cars when I want to because the value of my home and portfolio have gone up . '
" It 's silliness to say the credit crunch does n't matter , " said the executive .
" If the final sales numbers for August have any strength , it will be because of incentives . "
Experts in the field say that car purchases are one of the first items that consumers can and will put off if they are nervous about their own financial outlook , long before they 'll cut back on eating out or other discretionary purchases .
Bob Schnorbus , chief economist for auto research firm J.D. Power & Associates , said that the August sales probably wo n't tell the full story about the drag that the housing turmoil is causing for auto sales .
" I would n't expect it to have that quick impact ; I would expect it to be more of a drag throughout the rest of this year than a plummet in August , " he said .
And Schnorbus said that while consumers may keep making other types of purchases , even as they pull back from buying new cars and trucks , the slowdown could spread to other types of spending in the future if the market does not improve .
" A new car is one of the more postponable purchases that people make , " said Schnorbus .
" That new vehicle purchase could be a good leading indicator if consumers are going to cut back .
Over the next few months , we could be getting some very interesting signals . "
Laptop consumers can be a pretty tough crowd to please , because the limitations of laptops usually stand in the way of manufacturers putting in everything a pretentious consumer might want their device to have .
That being said when you finally use a laptop that feels incredibly sturdy performance - wise , you ca n’t help but applaud the manufacturer ’s efforts .
Two of the laptops that are able to produce such a reaction out of their audience are the XPS 15 from Dell and Apple ’s own MacBook 15 .
Many might wonder what sets these two beasts apart and today we ’ll going to look deeper into that inquiry .
Here are the key differences between the two devices and how each can impress users .
Dell XPS 15
Dell ’s laptop comes with a max configuration of 32 GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD storage .
That alone is outstanding , but when you couple it with the Core i7 - 7700 HQ processing unit and the GTX 1050 graphics processor , you have yourself a remarkable device .
It also features a 4 K display which takes things up a notch than your “ regular ” full HD experience .
MacBook 15
The MacBook comes with the 6700HQ model of the i7 processor and the graphics choice of a Radeon Pro 450 .
Additional specs include 16 GB of RAM and 256 GB of SSD memory .
It comes with Apple ’s trademark quality displays that produce a crisp image but given the lower capabilities of the graphics card , it ’s questionable how much that matters .
While both devices are capable of dishing out great performance even worthy of a desktop configuration , the clear spec advantages of the Dell laptop make it the obvious choice in this situation .
That ’s not saying that the MacBook 15 is a bad laptop .
However , given the opportunity , most people would choose the better and cheaper option .
Dell ’s XPS 15 is by no means cheap , but in comparison with the MacBook price you could say that it ’s a little lighter on a user ’s financials .
Dell XPS 15 manages to offer a price that saves you more than $ 300 in comparison to the MacBook , which goes for around $ 2400 .
If you 'd been in Volare restaurant in downtown Chicago on Monday night , you would not have thought a US recession was imminent ; the place was packed , as , earlier , was most of Michigan Avenue , the principal shopping street , despite the freezing winds .
But that was before Friday as news spread of the collapse of Bear Stearns , America 's fifth largest investment bank .
A mounting financial crisis threatens to undermine the economy that supports , among many others , the clientele of Volare .
The United States is about to be trashed by perhaps the greediest , most arrogant , self - deluding financial class in the country 's history .
It is an epic tragedy whose ramifications are bound to impact on Britain and the rest of the world , beginning with the sanguine economic assumptions - of only the mildest of economic slowdowns - that underpinned Alistair Darling 's Budget forecasts last week .
But whether in Britain or America , politicians and policy - makers seem frozen into inactivity ( with the honourable exception of the US Federal Reserve , America 's central bank ) .
Messrs Brown and Darling echo President Bush and US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson ; as little as possible must be done to regulate or impede the operation of the titans of Wall Street and the City , whatever their recklessness .
Even Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , slugging it out for the Democratic presidential nomination , are happier to talk about the threat to American jobs from foreign trade than the mortal threat constituted by an out - of - control and broken financial system .
Yet to blame foreign trade for America 's ills is both stupid and wrong .
The untold story of our times is of US industry not just holding the line but expanding production , a phenomenon gathering pace as the dollar plunges on world markets , promoting super US competitiveness .
American brands and companies increasingly populate the world top 100 and the US invests stunning sums on its knowledge economy base - software , universities and R&D .
Britain spends proportionally half as much while our exports and industrial base languish .
We are much more vulnerable than even the Americans to the impact of falling house prices and contracting credit , though you would never guess it from the way policy is made .
For the US to put its success at risk through protectionism , the stance taken by both Clinton and Obama , while indulging Wall Street is mad .
The heart of Keynesian economics was never tax and spend ; it was the warning from the greatest economist of the 20th century that a financial system based on free - market principles inevitably destabilised the health and stability of capitalism .
Keynes knew his ideas would be contested to the last because he threatened the orthodoxies of laissez faire and the fortunes of the financiers .
So it is proving again .
For make no mistake - the global economy is under threat .
It is the slump in American property prices that has prompted the collapse of trust in Wall Street .
And the chief reason property prices are falling is an epidemic of repossessions caused because banks lent to poor , uncreditworthy borrowers .
Then they disappeared , selling off the debts .
The Americans have invented a system with no commitment , trust or long - term human relationships and the result is mayhem .
For the banks , there was a glorious byproduct .
They could borrow to a stunning degree because they had , allegedly , spread their risk .
Bear Stearns had $ 11.8 bn of capital and $ 395bn of debt .
When things are going well , it is ' leverage ' like this that creates the volume of business that generates incredible bonuses for their executives .
When things go badly , the bank simply goes bust . .
The unresolved question is a humdinger .
How big is the void between all the debt and the actual , slipping , value of the property that is supposed to be sustaining it ?
And here 's another : how many banks may go bust before the situation steadies ?
Goldman Sachs estimate the gap at $ 2trn ; Professor Nouriel Roubini , of the Stern School of Business at New York University and a contemporary Nostradamus , says the number is $ 3trn .
Any which way , it is large and the only way to save the US economy from a credit - crunch - induced recession is to try to narrow the gap by steadying property prices , while the banks are thrown a lifeline .
So far , the chief activist has been the US central bank , the Federal Reserve , with the idea - lite Bush administration using the crisis to agree to tax cuts to stimulate the economy , its panacea for everything .
It was the Fed that earlier last week agreed to offer $ 200bn of support that would have helped Bear Stearns ; it was the Fed that bailed out Bear Stearns itself ; and it was the Fed that earlier slashed interest rates .
Chairman Ben Bernanke has said he will do everything in his power to prevent a rerun of 1929 .
But the Fed cannot shoulder the entire burden itself .
The US government needs to put a floor under house prices by offering mortgage guarantees and prohibiting immediate foreclosures .
Nor should the rest of the world stand idly by .
The impact of the financial crisis is rocking the dollar ; the EU , Japan , China and the oil exporters need to co-ordinate massive foreign exchange intervention .
The Europeans , and here Britain should take a lead , must redesign and reregulate their financial systems fast to close down the scope for the kind of seizure that has hit not just Bear Stearns , but British , German and French banks and threatens more .
There must be a readiness to offer any troubled bank as much liquidity as it needs .
This is not just an American , but global , emergency .
Above all , America 's politicians , especially leading Democrats , need to stop blaming foreigners for America 's problems while worshipping at the shrine of free finance .
Instead , they need to nail the real culprits .
On that the immediate future of the American - and our economy - depends .
Name Details of Drug Use , if Any
Michael R. Bloomberg
Asked during the 2001 mayoral campaign by New York magazine if he had ever used marijuana , said : ” You bet I did .
And I enjoyed it . ”
Later said he regretted those remarks .
George W. Bush Acknowledged in 1994 run for governor of Texas that he had abused alcohol , and decided to quit drinking when he turned 40 .
As candidate for president in 2000 , refused to answer directly whether he had used marijuana , cocaine or other illegal drugs , but said that he could have passed a 15 - year F.B.I. background check when his father became president — apparently ruling out drug use since 1974 .
As president , appeared to acknowledge past marijuana use in conversations with a family friend , Doug Wead .
Aides have denied specific allegations of other drug use in a 2004 biography by Kitty Kelley .
Bill Clinton
As a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in the late 1960s , tried marijuana .
“ I ’ve never broken a state law , ” he said .
“ But when I was in England I experimented with marijuana a time or two , and I did n’t like it .
I did n’t inhale it , and never tried it again . ”
Hillary Rodham Clinton
When running for Senate in 2000 , said she had never used marijuana or cocaine .
Andrew M. Cuomo Seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2002 , said , “ I have tried marijuana in my youth , ” but refused to say whether he had enjoyed it .
Rudolph W. Giuliani
As mayor , expounded from a City Hall lectern about why he had not tried marijuana or cocaine .
Later said he regretted even answering reporters ’ questions about personal drug use , saying , “ It ’s none of their business . ”
Al Gore As Democratic senator from Tennessee , disclosed in 1987 , when the Supreme Court appointment of Douglas H. Ginsburg was scuttled over the judge ’s past marijuana use , that he had used marijuana in his youth .
John Kerry , John Edwards and Howard Dean
All admitted , in succession at a Democratic presidential debate in 2003 , to having used marijuana in the past .
The Rev. Al Sharpton and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman said they had not .
John McCain
As candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1999 , was asked if he had ever tried marijuana and replied : ” No .
Also remember my age : 63 . ” ( Mr. McCain is now 71 . )
Explained at the time that drug use did not escalate among troops in Vietnam until after he had been taken prisoner .
Barack Obama
In his 1995 memoir , wrote that he indulged in marijuana , alcohol and sometimes cocaine as a high school student in Hawaii .
But his account significantly differed from the recollections of others who did not recall his drug use .
George E. Pataki
In his autobiography , the Republican governor wrote that he experimented with marijuana when a law school friend at Columbia University cooked it into a pot of baked beans .
Charles E. Schumer
Said that as a college student at Harvard ( where he graduated in 1971 ) , he never used marijuana .
“ It was illegal , ” the Democratic senator explained .
The use of tobacco is done for ages , and people cannot give up on it easily .
The usage of snus has become strangely very popular among people who ca n’t give up on tobacco .
Snus sale is illegal among Europe ’s cities , and manufacturing is not allowed to sell freely , and strict actions can be taken against it .
Even though snus is illegal , the snus ’ popularity is on the rise , so we are here taking a look behind the increasing popularity .
If you are eager to understand why Swedish snus is on top - selling things around the world .
Why Swedish snus so popular ?
The moist Swedish snus is manufactured in Sweden , in Norway along with the united states .
People have given up on cigarettes or other tobacco products instead of using Swedish snus .
Let us have a closer look at the aspect of grasping it better .
Quality standards : the quality provided in Swedish snus is unmatchable in terms of quality , where they provide more quality and minimal hazardous .
In contrast with other smokeless tobacco products that have poor quality and additional sweeteners , Swedish snus especially focus on superior quality products from nature .
Gothiathek standard is the quality snus standard were industry standard for a good amount of substances like metals , aldehydes , nitrosamines , and mycotoxins in the snus manufactured in Sweden .
Safety standards : Swedish snus is steam pasteurized , not fermented like other types of smokeless tobacco .
Snus has a lesser risk of lung cancer , pancreatic cancer , and oral cancer due to non-containment of tobacco - specific nitrosamines that are found in other smokeless tobacco products .
The process of tobacco inhibits the growth of microbes that creates cancer - causing chemical ; however , due to the superior quality provided , there is no such risk of cancer as high in other tobacco products .
No harmful combustion occurs that cigarettes do and making it a better substitute for people who cannot leave tobacco .
Effective smoking termination method : Swedish snus popularity has hit on top due to several reasons , but the top one remains a safe and better alternative of nicotine alternatives .
People who cannot give up on smokeless tobacco products that are harmful to you and put you at a higher risk of getting different cancers .
Variety of flavors : users do n’t get variety into other smokeless products , and users are restricted on the options .
Swedish snus is provided into a huge variety of the flavors in which it is provided to you .
With the increasing brand popularity variety of snus is increasing with richen flavors to make it easy for users to choose .
Snus brands such as Mocca , caliber , Siberia , Lyft that is sold by the online store , snusdirect .
Flavors such as berry , coffee , mint , eucalyptus , clove , cinnamon , honey , lemon , lime , fruit , and vanilla .
Conclusion
In conclusion , we can conclude to the aspect that the reasons behind the popularity are a convenience that tobacco users have , which is not provided in other smokeless products .
In addition , people who are struggling hard to give up on the tobacco products and want to get safer alternative will find Swedish snus ideal . …
Have you ever been betrayed by a old and trusted friend ?
If so , you might understand my rage at and disgust with The New York Times .
While I gave up on the Times some time ago , I ca n’t allow the latest outrage , the hiring of William Kristol as the newest Times columnist , to pass by without complaint .
The New York Times and I go way , way , back .
Since before I was born , my parents subscribed to the Times .
Throughout college , graduate school , and early career , the NYT was my gold - standard of journalistic accuracy and integrity .
It was reputed to be “ the newspaper of historical record , ” and I believed it .
When , in the sixties , I lived in Manhattan and taught at the City University of New York , I would eagerly await the Saturday night appearance of the Sunday edition , which I would then take home , spread out on my bed , and devour .
All the News That Gives Us Fits .
Had you been reading the Times for the past two decades , you would have learned :
** That Bill and Hillary Clinton were involved in a crooked land deal , dubbed “ Whitewater . ”
** That Chinese - American nuclear scientist , Dr. Wen Ho Lee , was probably spying for the Peoples Republic of China .
** That Al Gore was a “ serial liar ” who had claimed , among other things , to have “ invented the internet ” and to have “ discovered Love Canal . ”
** That Bush would have won Florida and the 2000 election , regardless of the Supreme Court decision , Bush v. Gore .
** That Saddam Hussein was importing aluminum tubes to manufacture weapons - grade uranium .
** That Saddam Hussein was stockpiling and prepared to use weapons of mass destruction .
All this was published as news , not as opinion .
And it was false .
All of it !
Had you searched elsewhere for news – the independent and foreign press , and the internet , you would have discovered :
** That the GOP slanders against Al Gore were all groundless .
** That the " Swift Boat Veterans for Truth " conducted a baseless smear against John Kerry , and conversely , that Kerry ’s military record and his medals were authentic .
** That George Bush was absent without leave from his military obligation with the Texas Air National Guard .
** That Bush likely violated securities law as an executive and investor with Harken energy .
** That there is compelling evidence that the 2000 , 2002 and 2004 elections were stolen by the Republicans through election fraud .
** That , according to " The Downing Street Memos , " prior to the outbreak of the Iraq war , Bush and Blair were willing to " fix the intelligence " to fit the pro-war policy .
None of this was prominently included among what The New York Times proclaims as “ All the News That ’s Fit to Print . ”
To its credit , the Times reported that the Bush Administration violated the FISA laws on wiretapping of US civilians .
However , the NYT held the story past the 2004 election , an editorial decision which might have affected the outcome .
Kristolnicht
And now , to top it all off , they ’ve hired Bill Kristol – notorious neo-conservative , Co-Founder of PNAC , propagandist , war - monger , demonstrable liar .
This editorial decision has set off an avalanche of complaints and cancelled subscriptions .
Some by writers who frequently contribute to the Times .
A sample :
Erica Jong : “ As a believer in free speech and the First Amendment , I understand the argument that all points of view be represented in your Op - Ed pages .
But in fact , they are not .
There is only one regular woman columnist ( and one on your blog ) , no feminist spokesperson who questions the status quo , no anti-war columnist , no columnist who speaks for the rights of children or questions the priorities of the military industrial complex ....
Why give more space to one who already has plentiful outlets and is not a questioner but a confirmed propagandist ? ”
Jane Smiley : “ I cannot imagine why the Times has hired Kristol .
Kristol is not merely some right wing loose cannon like David Brooks or even William Safire , and his hiring by the Times is not a free - speech issue .
Kristol has plenty of opportunities to speak , and if he did n’t he could blog , like the rest of us .
Kristol is a war - monger and a hate - monger , and his lies has been exposed over and over in the last four years ...
In Iraq alone , Kristol has the blood of hundreds of thousands on his hands .
He is unrepentant and eager for more ...
You would have thought that remorse for the Judith Miller debacle would have taught [ The New York Times ] something , but clearly not .
Sadly . ” D.S. Negroponte : “ It is not that Bill Kristol has an ‘ opinion ’ with which I disagree .
Bill Kristol is a strategist posing as a columnist .
The Times should n’t be giving him free space to push his agenda , and that of his employer , [ The American Enterprise Institute ] .
Bill Kristol was an architect of the propaganda campaign for the failed Iraq war and the failed surge ....
Kristol is a lying propagandist who poses as a writer / editor on television .
His fondness for Leo Strauss says to me that he openly espouses and glorifies the use of deception in public life ...
Public revulsion at the man has nothing to do with a rejection of free discourse , and everything to do with wanting to protect it . ”
The response by NYT Op - Ed Editor , Andrew Rosenthal , has been pathetically weak and hackneyed : “ Mr. Kristol ... is a columnist and magazine editor , with views that clearly bother you .
I disagree with many of his views , as well as many of the other views expressed on our Op - Ed page .
It is not my job to print only those with whom I agree .
It is my job to give readers [ as ] broad a spectrum of views to read as we can manage . ”
This excuse is ludicrous on its face .
Rosenthal seems to regard the Op - Ed page of The New York Times as equivalent to a Hyde Park soap box , a village bulletin board , or the internet – the latter open to anyone with a computer and a modem .
Anyone can play , and we do n’t exclude opinions just because we do n’t always agree with them .
Gimme a break !
In fact , the Op - Ed page of The New York Times is the most valuable and exclusive journalistic real - estate in the United States , and arguably the world , however much it may have been devalued by this most recent addition .
Space on the NYT Op - Ed page was at one time earned through merit : like a Pulitzer Prize , casting in a Broadway play , or a place in the New York Yankees lineup .
The publication of a Kristol column in The New York Times is as incongruous as the Yankees putting in the line - up , a player with a 000 batting average whose fielding errors frequently lose games .
This approximately describes Kristol ’s performance as a prognosticating pundit .
He is strictly Bush league material ( pun intended ) .
During my career I have refereed hundreds of submissions to scholarly journals .
These journals insist that the referees set high standards , since only a very few submissions are accepted for publication .
None of these journals allow what Rosenthal would have us believe is the NYT Op - Ed standard : “ It is my job to give readers [ as ] broad a spectrum of views to read as we can manage . ”
No , Mr. Rosenthal , it is your job to give your readers intelligent , informed , cogent commentary , from columnists with a proven record of factual accuracy , foresight and integrity .
William Kristol fails on all counts .
The New York Times can pick from a field of thousands of outstanding conservative scholars and journalists .
Kristol is not , by any stretch of the imagination , the best that you can do .
Andrew Rosenthal and The New York Times will likely weather the immediate storm of protests and cancellations provoked by Kristol ’s addition to the Op - Ed page .
But this outlandish and misguided editorial decision can only continue the decline of a once - magnificent newspaper .
That decline will accelerate if , along with falling circulation , many additional outstanding writers such as Erica Jong and Jane Smiley , refuse to publish in the Times .
Redemption .
The news is not all bad .
Paul Krugman , Frank Rich , Bob Herbert remain on the NYT Op - Ed page .
And just last week , the Times editorial page published a searing indictment of the Bush Administration , “ Looking at America . ”
In addition , last Sunday the NYT Magazine published one of the first mainstream media investigations into the election crisis , Clive Thompson ’s “ Can You Count on Voting Machines ? ”
Though much less than what the “ black box voting ” critics would want ( the author refuses deal seriously with the issue of whether the 2000 , 2002 and 2004 elections might have been stolen ) , it is at least a breakthrough .
To get back on track toward a reinstatement of its former greatness , The New York Times need only look to the past , and to the standards that at one time it scrupulously enforced .
A restoration of its former reputation will lag behind these reforms , as it must , for the Times must prove itself anew .
There is no need for The New York Times to compensate for its recent swerve to the right by becoming a mouthpiece for the progressive Democrats .
Just the facts – “ All the news that ’s fit to print ” – will nicely suffice .
After all , as Stephen Colbert correctly observes , “ reality has a liberal bias . ”

FOR its supporters , the idea of growing single - celled algae on exhaust gas piped from power stations is the ultimate in recycling .
For its detractors , it is a mere pipe dream .
Whoever turns out to be right , though , it is an intriguing idea : instead of releasing the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels into the atmosphere , why not recapture it by photosynthesis ?
The result could then be turned into biodiesel ( since many species of algae store their food reserves as oil ) , or even simply dried and fed back into the power station .
Of course , if it were really that easy , someone would have done it already .
But although no one has yet commercialised the technology , several groups are trying .
One of them is GS CleanTech , which has developed a bioreactor based on a patent held by a group of scientists at the Ohio Coal Research Centre , at the University of Ohio .
The GS CleanTech bioreactor uses a parabolic mirror to funnel sunlight into fibre - optic cables that carry the light to acrylic “ glow plates ” inside the reactor .
These diffuse the light over vertical sheets of polyester that form the platform on which the algae grow .
Eventually the polyester is unable to support the weight of the algae , and they fall off into a collection duct positioned underneath .
GreenFuel Technologies , based in Cambridge , Massachusetts , has a different approach .
Its reactor is composed of a series of clear tubes , each with a second , opaque tube nested inside .
This arrangement makes it possible to bubble the exhaust gas down through the outer compartment and then bubble it back up through the opaque middle .
The bubbling gas causes turbulence and circulates the algae around the reactor .
The constant shift between light and darkness as the algal cells circulate increases the amount of carbon that they fix , probably by promoting chemical reactions that occur naturally only at night .
A preliminary test of GreenFuel 's reactor design , which was performed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's campus power plant , suggested that it can remove 75 % of the carbon dioxide from a power station 's exhaust .
A more serious test is now being carried out by Arizona Public Service , that state 's power utility , at its Redhawk plant .
Another test is planned in Louisiana .
GreenFuel claims that over the course of a year , a hectare ( 2.5 acres ) of its reactors should be able to produce 30,000 litres ( 8,000 American gallons ) of oil , which could be used as biodiesel , and enough carbohydrates to be fermented into 9,000 litres of ethanol , which can be used as a substitute for petrol .
There is , of course , no free lunch .
As Rob Carlson of the University of Washington points out , if money is to be made selling products made from exhaust gas , then that gas goes from being waste matter to being a valuable resource .
Far from giving it away , power companies might even start charging for it .
That would , indeed , be a reversal of fortune .
Alonzo Church was one of the greatest math brains that America has ever produced .
He was a mathematics professor at Princeton University for nearly four decades and his work was extremely influential in fields such as mathematical logic , theoretical computer science , and recursion theory .
When he passed away in 1995 , he was regarded as one of the best logicians the world has ever seen .
The Church Project is named after him and they are concerned with developing technology that has superior reliability , performance , and usability .
Below we will take a look at why technology is really important in business .
Technology Improves Communication
Nowadays , companies are reliant on different communication software to communicate with others .
Companies need to consider a number of technical aspects before they decide on the way of communication for their company .
For instance , if a company is in need of instant feedback , they should opt for phone services as this provides quality voice .
Effective communication will ensure that the business runs smoothly and that everyone is highly motivated .
Communication breakdown can lead to a number of issues for employees , which can damage the company .
Therefore , companies should preoccupy and prepare contingency plans for themselves in case issues arrive in communication .
Helps to Improve Efficiency
Nobody can deny the fact that technology improves the efficiency of a business .
The advancements in sciences and robotics has helped companies to facilitate their customers .
Furthermore , thanks to artificial intelligence , companies are able to use technology better .
For example , using chatbots to deal with customer issues .
Using technology saves effort and time as the company does not need to find human labor and it also increases productivity , which is always great for a company .
Protects Against Attacks
Online attacks are becoming a regular thing , and these can be very damaging to businesses .
Thus , there are now plenty of cybersecurity defense systems that can protect businesses from such threats .
The possibility of a cyber - attack is something that is not going to go away soon , so businesses need to protect themselves by improving their online accounts security .
This can be done by using the latest defense technology .
Provides Unlimited Knowledge
Thanks to technology , there is absolutely no limit as to what a company can or cannot achieve .
Technology provides all the knowledge that a company could ever need .
For instance , carrying out research has never been simpler as companies can instantly find the information that they are looking for on the Internet .
It also helps you to keep an eye on your rivals and take the necessary measures to ensure that you stay ahead of the game .
Allows Exploration and Growth
By using the latest technology , companies are able to explore loads of new markets that will allow them to expand their operations as well as their profitability .
Technology can help to provide complex calculations and give authentic forecasts .
By getting authentic results they will be able to see whether it is worth moving ahead with their plan .
Helps to Increase Capacity
Technology allows companies to reach out to more of their customers in less time than it would usually take .
This obviously means that they can serve more people than they were able to before , which means that they can get more profit than they did before .
To add to this , it also means that companies are now easily able to communicate with their suppliers when they need to top of their goods .
Allows for Cryptocurrency Use
Blockchain technology has allowed cryptocurrency to come into being .
Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world and , like the American dollar , it is a medium of exchange .
However , the main difference is that it is encrypted and digital to manage the control of different monetary units .
This technology has allowed companies all over the world to make secure and safe payments with fully fledged records .
In other words , Blockchain keeps all transaction records so that companies can keep an eye on when and where their money is being transferred .
Palaeontologists have discovered fossil remains in Scandinavia of parrots dating back 55 million years .
Reported May 14 in the journal Palaeontology , the fossils indicate that parrots once flew wild over what is now Norway and Denmark .
Parrots today live only in the tropics and southern hemisphere , but this new research suggests that they first evolved in the North , much earlier than had been thought .
The fossil parrot was discovered on the Isle of Mors in the northwest of Denmark – far from where you ’d normally expect to find a parrot .
It ’s a new species , officially named ' Mopsitta tanta ' .
However , already its nick - name is the ‘ Danish Blue Parrot ’ , a term derived from a famous comedy sketch about a ' Norwegian Blue Parrot ' in the 1970s BBC television programme ‘ Monty Python ’ .
The Scandinavian connection makes links to Monty Python ’s notoriously demised bird irresistible , but the parallels go further .
The famous sketch revolves around establishing that a bird purchased by John Cleese is a dead parrot , and in dealing with these fossils , palaeontologists were faced with the same problem .
As Dr David Waterhouse , lead author of the paper , explains : “ Obviously , we are dealing with a bird that is bereft of life , but the tricky bit is establishing that it was a parrot .
As with many fragile bird fossils , it is a wonder that anything remains at all , and all that remains of this early Danish parrot is a single upper wing bone ( humerus ) .
But , this small bone contains characteristic features that show that it is clearly from a member of the parrot family , about the size of a Yellow - crested Cockatoo . ”
Dr David Waterhouse was funded by a UCD postgraduate scholarship from 2002 to 2006 .
He is currently Assistant Curator of Natural History at Norfolk Museums Service .
Dr Bent Lindow was an IRCSET ‘ Basic Research Grant ’ scholar at UCD and the University of Copenhagen from 2004 to 2007 .
He is currently postdoctoral researcher in palaeontology at the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen .
At around 55 million years old , this is very much an ex-parrot .
Indeed , Mopsitta represents the oldest and most northerly convincing remains of a parrot ever to have been discovered .
Waterhouse continues : “ It is n’t as unbelievable as you might at first think that a parrot was found so far north .
When Mopsitta was alive , most of Northern Europe was experiencing a warm period , with a large shallow tropical lagoon covering much of Germany , South East England and Denmark .
We have to remember that this was only 10 million years after the dinosaurs were wiped out , and some strange things were happening with animal life all over the planet . ”
“ No Southern Hemisphere fossil parrot has been found older than about 15 million years old , so this new evidence suggests that parrots evolved right here in the Northern Hemisphere before diversifying further South in the tropics later on . ”
So was Danish Mopsitta “ pinin ’ for the fjords ” ?
“ It ’s a lovely image , ” says Waterhouse , “ but we can say with certainty that it was not .
This parrot shuffled off its mortal coil around 55 million years ago , but the fjords of Norway were formed during the last ice age and are less than a million years old . ”
This research was supported by the Irish Research Council for Science , Engineering and Technology ( IRCSET ) and University College Dublin ( UCD ) .

Bush administration officials including Vice President Dick Cheney approved harsh interrogation techniques for suspected terrorists , ABC News reported .
During the meetings , top officials were discussing Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) interrogation methods , such as slapping , pushing , sleep deprivation or simulated drowning .
Following the first reports about the details of the meetings that took place on Wednesday , a former senior U.S. intelligence official confirmed the information on Thursday to the AP .
The meetings were held in the White House Situation Room and started right after the terrorists attack on September , 11 .
Sessions were attended by the National Security Council 's Principals Committee , a selected team of senior officials that were advising president on the matters regarding national security policy .
These members included National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Vice President Dick Cheney , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Colin Powell and CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General John Ashcroft .
Rumsfeld and Powell refused to comment on Tuesday about the interrogation program or the details of these discussions .
Senator Edward M. Kennedy , District of Massachusetts , criticized the decision saying that " our country will continue to pay the price for his administration 's renegade repudiation of the rule of law and fundamental human rights . "
That was the first time when Bush administration officials uncovered the details of torture techniques on terror suspects .

Today most people get on average 4 to 6 hours of exercise every day , and make sure that everything they put in their mouths is not filled with sugars or preservatives , but they pay no attention to their mental health , no vacations , not even the occasional long weekend .
All of this for hopes of one day getting that big promotion .
This response is important for our ability to learn from mistakes , but it also gives rise to self - criticism , because it is part of the threat - protection system .
In other words , what keeps us safe can go too far , and keep us too safe .
In fact , it can trigger self - censoring .

One morning , when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams , he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin .
He lay on his armour - like back , and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly , slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections .
The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment .
His many legs , pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him , waved about helplessly as he looked .
NEW BRUNSWICK , N.J. 
When a fellow student at Rutgers University urged Didi Onejeme to try Philosophy 101 two years ago , Ms. Onejeme , who was a pre-med sophomore , dismissed it as “ frou - frou . ”
“ People sitting under trees and talking about stupid stuff  I mean , who cares ? ” Ms. Onejeme recalled thinking at the time .
But Ms. Onejeme , now a senior applying to law school , ended up changing her major to philosophy , which she thinks has armed her with the skills to be successful .
“ My mother was like , what are you going to do with that ? ” said Ms. Onejeme , 22 .
“ She wanted me to be a pharmacy major , but I persuaded her with my argumentative skills . ”
Once scoffed at as a luxury major , philosophy is being embraced at Rutgers and other universities by a new generation of college students who are drawing modern - day lessons from the age - old discipline as they try to make sense of their world , from the morality of the war in Iraq to the latest political scandal .
The economic downturn has done little , if anything , to dampen this enthusiasm among students , who say that what they learn in class can translate into practical skills and careers .
On many campuses , debate over modern issues like war and technology is emphasized over the study of classic ancient texts .
Congress , the groups said , had given Mr. Chertoff too much power .
“ It is only happenchance that the secretary ’s waiver in this case involved laws protecting the environment and historic resources , ” the groups told Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle of Federal District Court in Washington .
“ He could equally have waived the requirements of the Fair Labor Relations
Act to halt a strike , or the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act in order to force workers to endure unsafe working conditions . ”

( Happenchance ?
You do n’t see that word every day , and certainly not in a court filing . )
The groups said Congress cannot hand over unbridled power to the executive branch even as it cuts the courts out of the picture .
They relied mostly on a 1998 Supreme Court decision striking down the Line Item Veto Act , which had allowed the president to cancel parts of laws .
In December , Judge Huvelle rejected the challenge and allowed construction to proceed .
She said she had no jurisdiction to decide whether Mr. Chertoff was correct in saying the waivers were necessary , and she ruled that the delegation of power to him was constitutional .
“ The court concludes that it lacks the power to invalidate the waiver provision merely because of the unlimited number of statutes that could potentially be encompassed , ” Judge Huvelle wrote .
A petition asking the Supreme Court to hear the case was filed three months later .
Did you notice the missing step ?
In addition to forbidding judges from second - guessing Mr. Chertoff ’s decisions , Congress forbade federal appeals courts from becoming involved at all .
After losing before Judge Huvelle , the groups ’ only recourse is to hope the Supreme Court decides to hear their appeal .
In their petition , the environmental groups said the Supreme Court had never upheld a broad delegation of power like that given to Mr. Chertoff without the possibility of judicial review of executive branch determinations .
Nor , they said , has any appeals court .
BAIKONUR , Kazakhstan ( Reuters ) - A Russian Soyuz rocket carrying South Korea ’s first astronaut blasted off into space on Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan .
The Soyuz TMA - 12 spaceship disappeared into a clear sky as planned at 5:16 p.m. ( 1116 GMT ) after lifting off from the world ’s oldest space launch pad , used by Russia ’s Yuri Gagarin when he became the first human in space in 1961 .
Yi So-yeon , a 29 - year - old nanotechnology engineer , began her journey to the International Space Station ( ISS ) alongside Russian cosmonauts Sergei Volkov and Oleg Kononenko .
Dozens of Korean fans and officials , their faces painted in the colors of their national flag , cheered and sang as loudspeakers at the launch pad announced the rocket had safely delivered the spaceship into orbit .
“ She ( Yi ) has bravely overcome all the difficulties , ” Choi Gi-hyuk , director of astronaut projects at the South Korea Aerospace Research Institute , told Reuters after watching the launch .
“ I feel great .
Four years of efforts by Korean and Russian experts have finally become successful . ”
Yi ’s family observed the rocket ’s blast - off from a special observation post nearby .
Yi ’s mother burst into tears as the spaceship turned into a dot and disappeared in the sky .

Originally a reserve candidate , Yi was picked for the flight last month after Russia accused Ko San , the primary South Korean crew member , of removing sensitive documents from a training centre .
Ko later apologized for his actions .
In South Korea ’s capital Seoul , a crowd of thousands including President Lee Mung - bak and astronaut Yi’s sister watched the launch on wide screen TVs in front of City Hall .
Lee pumped his fist in the air as the rocket soared skyward and the crowd cheered .
The South Korean government paid Russia about $ 25 million for the right to send the first Korean into space .
Along with her Russian colleagues ,
Yi will conduct scientific experiments at the ISS during her 11 - day mission .
Yi has said she would take a bit of Korean culture into outer space by serving the traditional kimchi spicy cabbage and singing a song at a dinner party on the ISS on April 12 .
Though Dr. Hofmann ’s father was a Roman Catholic and his mother a Protestant , Dr. Hofmann , from an early age , felt that organized religion missed the point .
When he was 7 or 8 , he recalled , he spoke to a friend about whether Jesus was divine .
“ I said that I did n’t believe , but that there must be a God because there is the world and someone made the world , ” he said .
“ I had this very deep connection with nature . ”
Dr. Hofmann went on to study chemistry at Zurich University because , he said , he wanted to explore the natural world at the level where energy and elements combine to create life .
He earned his Ph.D. there in 1929 , when he was just 23 .
He then took a job with Sandoz Laboratories in Basel , attracted by a program there that sought to synthesize pharmacological compounds from medicinally important plants .
It was during his work on the ergot fungus , which grows in rye kernels , that he stumbled on LSD , accidentally ingesting a trace of the compound one Friday afternoon in April 1943 .
Soon he experienced an altered state of consciousness similar to the one he had experienced as a child .
On the following Monday , he deliberately swallowed a dose of LSD and rode his bicycle home as the effects of the drug overwhelmed him .
That day , April 19 , later became memorialized by LSD enthusiasts as “ bicycle day . ”
Dr. Hofmann ’s work produced other important drugs , including methergine , used to treat postpartum hemorrhaging , the leading cause of death from childbirth .
But it was LSD that shaped both his career and his spiritual quest .
“ Through my LSD experience and my new picture of reality , I became aware of the wonder of creation , the magnificence of nature and of the animal and plant kingdom , ” Dr. Hofmann told the psychiatrist Stanislav Grof during an interview in 1984 .
“ I became very sensitive to what will happen to all this and all of us . ”
Tracy Jones of the Compass Center , a Seattle agency that has seen a handful of new homeless each month , said she was surprised by “ the quickness in which Iraqi Freedom veterans are becoming homeless ” compared with the Vietnam era .
The availability of meth and crack could lead addicts into rapid downhill spirals , Ms. Jones said .
Poverty and high housing costs also contribute .
The National Alliance to End Homelessness in Washington will release a report on Thursday saying that among one million veterans who served after the Sept. 11 attacks , 72,000 are paying more than half their incomes for rent , leaving them highly vulnerable .
Mr. Dougherty of the V.A. said outreach officers , who visit shelters , soup kitchens and parks , had located about 1,500 returnees from Iraq or Afghanistan who seemed at high risk , though many had jobs .
More than 400 have entered agency - supported residential programs around the country .
No one knows how many others have not made contact with aid agencies .
More than 11 percent of the newly homeless veterans are women , Mr. Dougherty said , compared with 4 percent enrolled in such programs over all .

Veterans have long accounted for a high share of the nation ’s homeless .
Although they make up 11 percent of the adult population , they make up 26 percent of the homeless on any given day , the National Alliance report calculated .
According to the V.A. , some 196,000 veterans of all ages were homeless on any given night in 2006 .
That represents a decline from about 250,000 a decade back , Mr. Dougherty said , as housing and medical programs grew and older veterans died .

Motherboard Walls
Our final contribution to the lab space was a three - month endeavor .
It started after Aubrey and I built a motherboard collage to hang above my desk ( see first row of images ) .
Scott Hudson liked it so much , he asked us to produce several more for his lab ( where a lot of electronics fabrication occurs ) .
This kicked off a month - long motherboard buying extravaganza .
By December , I had amassed about 150 lbs worth .
Most were bulk lots purchased off ebay at an average cost of $ 1.35 per pound , including shipping cost ( cheap ! ) .
Construction did n't start until after winter break .
When Aubrey and I returned , we set aside two thursday afternoons .
Each motherboard wall took approximately 6 hours to assemble .
The longest step by far was laying them out .
Not only did we try to distribute the colors in an interesting way , but dozens of different sized boards had to fit together perfectly and not overlap the edges .
Not an easy task I assure you .
Additionally , we added a third dimension by stilting approximately one fourth of the boards at different heights .
This project was featured on Gizmodo , Neatorama , Hack a Day , and other blogs in August 2008 .
Did you ever hear the phrase , they sure do n’t make things like they used to ?
That phrase can attach to so many things or situations within our collective lives .
During the Viet Nam War , a powerful song came out and one that I still feel applicable to this day .
It was sung by Country Joe and the Blowfish titled , I Feel like I ’m Fixin to Die Rag .
Below are they lyrics to this wonderful song and all one has to do is substitute Iran since Iraq is but a foot note in my belief .
The reason for saying that is that Washington already has Iran in their sights .
They want endless wars for year and years to come .
In copying the lyrics the beginning of it while spelling fish as we all know in listening to this song was the ‘ f ’ word .
Yes , we are all indeed f’d should our government allow for this to happen .
Just the mere fact that it mentions Wall Street is as telling back then as it is now .
As we all know , stocks from companies like Halliburton , Bechtel , Kellogg Brown and Root , Raytheon and so many other wonderful defense contractors are traded which line the pockets of these whores of greed .
As they get insanely rich , the world waits for their weaponry to take some to the Pearly Gates and others to the Gates of Hell .
I would like to think that all that have been protesting this war in Iraq and as some have begun to speak out against any war with Iran will surely make it to the Pearly Gates and the rest ; well we all know where they are going .
If you think that Washington cares , I invite you to read one of the most powerful articles written by Michael S. Rozeff titled , On Track for U.S. Collapse .
In reading it , you will tremble with the utmost fright as I did .
In my thank you letter to Mr. Rozeff , I wrote in part , “ Not only do I think that Bush and Cheney need to be impeached but many of the powerful elected officials we have on both sides of the political aisle in Washington .
All need to be removed from power , for allowing these events to unfold .
They have in fact betrayed the American people . ”
Who are those people you may be asking ?
In my opinion any elected official like Senators , Lieberman , Kyl , Clinton , McCain , Brownback and many more .
Any presidential candidate no matter what side of the political aisle that states no option should be taken off the table such as Senator Obama should also be removed from power .
This is only our survival as a people that I am speaking of .
Those who are not in power presently yet saber rattle like former Mayor Rudy Giuliani , former Senator Fred Thompson are beyond contempt if this is the world they wish to give us as president .
After reading Mr. Rozeff ’s piece another song came to my head and that is Barry McGuire ’s song , Eve of Destruction and as you will see , I also copied the lyrics to that song .
Having just listened to it , this stanza sang out to me , “ Yeah , my blood ’s so mad feels like coagulatin ”
I just wonder how many are feeling this way from coast - to - coast as they see Washington taking us down the darkened abyss .
As we scream in anger and become terrified , as we open up our mouths to scream , while it is a deafening roar , Washington chooses to hear silence .
If you think for one second that the top - tier presidential candidates on both sides of the political aisle can deliver us from this madness , think again .
This message goes to both Republicans and Democrats alike do not vote for any of these top - tier candidates in the upcoming primaries .
Our very survival depends upon it .
No , this is not a red VS blue call to the American people , but one of our very survival .
Without further adieu , I now present the lyrics to these two powerful songs and hope that it shall resonate with all who read them .
Move the slider toward either candidate to explore how many superdelegates are needed to secure the presidential nomination .

The U.S. Federal Reserve has forgotten the most essential rule .
They should first do no harm .
In a rush to bailout the bankers from their self inflicted mortgage mess , the Federal Reserve has seriously distorted the U.S. monetary system .
In this week 's graph are plotted the year - to - year dollar change for several Federal Reserve balance sheet items .
The first bar is for Reserve Bank Credit , which is essentially the change in the Fed 's total assets .
It is the monetary base from which money is created .
The second bar is for the Fed 's holdings of government securities .
The third is essentially the special lending facility created to bail out bankers .
The Federal Reserve has lent more than $ 200 billion to the creators of the mortgage mess .
At the same time as indicated by the second bar , the Fed has extracted from the rest of the economy nearly a like amount .
In essence , the Federal Reserve has reallocated money from Main Street to Wall Street .
This massive shift of funds to Wall Street away from producing sectors of the U.S. economy has some strong implications .
The U.S. recession will be deeper and longer .
Rather than allowing the system to purge itself of weak financial institutions , the Federal Reserve is providing them with special funding .
Money has been shifted from goods and services producing sectors to non productive financial entities .
Massive economic recession now rolling across U.S. , and into Canada , was created by misguided policies at the Federal Reserve .
Now , another round of misguided policies has been initiated .
This latest set of actions is not a cure , but a prolonger of the disease and rot .
These actions will only exacerbate the long - term Bear market for the U.S. dollar .
Over time , $ Gold 's price will benefit from these actions .
Gold is insurance against acts of the central bank .
On a tactical basis , Gold has passed into a correction .
Investors should use any serious price weakness which is likely to develop to add to Gold holdings in a measured manner .
Also , be wary of oil trading lemmings , their next act may push Gold lower and deeper than many consider possible .

Obama ’s attendance at anti-white sermon reaches mainstream » The shocking , part - of - a- pattern , random , deliberate , drunken , religiously motivated , tension - caused , not - to - be- publicized - because - it - may - cause - tensions beating of Anglican clergyman
Here is a This is London about the follow - up fromabout the assault on Canon Michael Ainsworth by Muslim youths in east London .
Comments by me are in brackets .
Wife of vicar beaten for ‘ being a Christian ’ by Asian yobs speaks of shock at faith hate attack
The wife of a clergyman beaten up in his churchyard in a suspected “ faith hate crime ” has spoken of the shock felt by his congregation .
Canon Michael Ainsworth , 57 , was set upon by three Asian youths shouting anti-Christian abuse when he confronted them for rowdy behaviour outside St George - in - the - East church in Shadwell , leaving him with two black eyes and cuts and bruises .
His wife , Janina Ainsworth , 56 , took Palm Sunday services yesterday after Canon Ainsworth was re-admitted to hospital for his injuries .
She said : “ It is obvious that it does contain a religious element .
“ Quite clearly , there are mindless individuals in every community under the influence of drink and drugs who will engage in random acts of violence .
But we ’re very shocked . ”
[ So the attack was motivated by religion , yet it is also “ random . ” ]
She said her husband was expected home to the rectory next to the church in Cannon Street Road tonight .
“ We do know that churchyards have been quite vulnerable places so we are going to be working with the church , the police and the local council to look at security , ” she added .
Wife Jan insists her husband feared publicity over the attack could lead to racial tension .
[ Muslims have physically mauled him in his churchyard in a deliberate Muslim attack on a Christian , but there should n’t be public discussion of this religiously motivated attack , because that could lead to “ tensions . ” ]
“ Normally community relations here are very good .
We have had very strong messages of support from the East London Mosque and Tower Hamlets Mosque with whom we ’ve got good relations .
“ Clearly the Muslim community is very shocked .
These individuals were under the influence and this was a random act . ”
The Bishop of London , the Rt Rev Richard Chartres , said clergymen who were part of the community were “ vulnerable ” to attacks .
“ Over the years we ’ve had murders , we ’ve had assaults on clergy , ” he said .
“ Therefore we have over the past few years been beefing up our security and operations .
“ But of course if you go out into the streets , if you belong to the community , if you ’re a part of it , then you are vulnerable . ”
[ Translation : Christian clergymen operating visibly in a Muslim community are vulnerable to physical attacks by Muslims .
This has happened before , it ’s a known problem , and they ’ve even been increasing security to handle it .
Yet Canon Ainsworth ’s parishioner are “ shocked ” by the attack , and Mrs. Ainsworth says the attack is “ random , ” and they all insist that community relations are good . ]
Mrs Ainsworth faced a fearful congregation yesterday who said rising tensions in the area had led up to the attack on 5 March , the second time the church has been targeted after a Good Friday attack last year in which youths threw bricks through the windows .
Gravestones in nearby St Dunstan ’s Church in Stepney are also regularly vandalised and locals say drink and drugs problems , combined with religious differences , fuel the attacks .
[ Muslims are regularly vandalizing Christian gravestones , but the attack on Ainsworth was “ random . ” ]
Parishioner Susan Crocker said : “ It is not out of the blue , they broke the glass last Easter — it ’s a recurrent problem . ”
Toni Davey , 43 , said : “ To be honest something like this was going to happen sooner or later — it is the area and the times we are living in .
There is a tension in the area with the Muslims . ”
[ Muslims are regularly physically attacking Christian churches and Christian clergymen , but what ’s causing the attacks is not Muslims , but “ a tension in the area with the Muslims . ”
The “ tension ” — presumptively shared equally by Christian and Muslims — is the agent in the attacks , not the Muslims who are actually doing the attacks .
To complete the argument , maybe the attacks should be attributed to “ random tensions . ”
Meanwhile , the attack , which was caused by “ tensions , ” should n’t be publicized , because that could lead to “ tensions . ” ]
Father - of - four Mr Ainsworth officiated last year at the wedding of Coronation Street star Andy Whyment , who plays Kirk Sutherland .
Canon Ainsworth asked three Asian youths to quiten down when he was attacked in the grounds of St George - in - the - East He moved with his family from Manchester last summer and was said to be working hard to connect with the large Bangladeshi community in the area .
Michael Saward , 75 , said : “ I saw Michael about 10 days ago and he looked very frail and fragile with two large black eyes .
Obviously we ’re all very shocked . ”
Police have confirmed the case is being treated as a faith - hate crime and no arrests have been made .
The Rev Alan Green , area dean for Tower Hamlets and chairman of the Tower Hamlets Inter - Faith Forum , said : “ Any incident that involves an element of abusive faith - related language should be handled in this way .
“ An important part of the work of the Tower Hamlets Inter Faith Forum is to bring together representatives from our local faith communities , the borough council and the Metropolitan Police to monitor and respond to all reported faith - hate incidents .
“ This ensures that we protect people of all faiths or none and maintain the good relations that exist locally between our diverse population . ”
[ Translation : Even as the Muslims become more numerous and aggressive and begin to use physical assaults and intimidation to scare Christian out of the area , the Christians devote their energies to maintaining “ good relations ” with the Muslims .
The logical culmination of these “ good relations ” is the complete Muslim takeover of Britain and the reduction of the British population to dhimmitude . ] - end of initial entry -
My comments above are an expansion on Anthony Damato ’s remarks which he sent along with the article :
The Moslem community is “ shocked ” at the beating !
Additionally , the “ youths ” coulda been under the “ influence , ” but community relations with area mosques are “ good , ” but sometimes bad , but these things happen , but there is a history of attacks on clergy , church property and tombstones , and the beaten priest fears fueling “ racial tensions ” , and the official line is “ to maintain the GOOD relations that exists locally between OUR diverse population . ”
Whew .
How much doublespeak and brainwashing can be crammed into one article ?
Rick Darby writes : Rick Darby writes : I was going to blog about this but I see you got there first and said most of what I was going to say .
It ’s harder and harder for me to sympathize with people like the Ainsworths .
As an individual Mr. Ainsworth is as entitled as anyone to live in denial about the reality of aggressive Islam , if he wants to believe it touches him only in the guise of “ random ” violence from ordinary yobs .
But as a clergyman he is in a position of responsibility : directly , for his church and congregation , and indirectly , for his neighborhood and country .
In opting out of reality , he is failing in his responsibility toward all those others .
If his congregation is “ fearful , ” as the newspaper account has it , is n’t it down to him to speak out on their behalf , for their safety as well as his , instead of acting as though not publicizing the situation will make it go away ?
If the truth is that his patch has been the scene of murders and assaults on the clergy , as the Bishop of London acknowledges , should n’t his conscience require him to stand for the sanctity of life and liberty , even if his ideology insists that what is happening should n’t be happening in a vibrant multi-culti paradise ?
“ Clearly the Muslim community is very shocked , ” he says .
“ These individuals were under the influence and this was a random act . ”
Excuse me , Canon , but how do you know the Muslim community was “ very shocked ” ?
Have large numbers of people from the Muslim community been in touch to express their shock ?
I rather doubt it , since if that had happened I expect you would have eagerly mentioned it .
But nothing seems to get through to people like this ; you get the feeling the “ Asians ” could burn his church down and he ’d be ( once again ) shocked and call for another community outreach meeting .

“ The police told me , ‘ We ca n’t do anything , he ’s your husband , ’ ” she said .
But Ms. Musabih ’s approach clearly shocked and angered many , and not just the husbands whose wives found shelter .
A prominent cleric , Ahmed al - Kobeissi , recently gave interviews to Dubai newspapers in which he said Ms. Musabih ’s work “ goes against the traditions of Emirati people ” because she “ instigates wives against their husbands . ”
Mr. Kobeissi also voiced indignation at Ms. Musabih ’s suggestion that Emirati men are among the clients of Dubai ’s many prostitutes .
Ms. Musabih ’s work took on a higher public profile when she joined a crusade against the practice of using children , some as young as 4 , as camel jockeys , once common in the Persian Gulf .
Her advocacy led to a number of television and newspaper reports about the horrific abuses practiced on young jockeys , and appears to have helped lead to a ban on the practice in the Emirates in 2005 .
Ms. Musabih is full of praise for the Emirati government ’s response on this issue , and says it responded quickly and effectively to her appeals to change the laws .
But her highly public approach to the problem is said to have angered some influential Emiratis , who felt she had embarrassed the leadership instead of allowing the matter to be settled quietly .
In the early spring of 2007 , government officials approached Ms. Musabih about plans for a new state - sanctioned women ’s shelter , apparently intended to replace hers .
At first she welcomed the idea , because her shelter was often crowded and she was struggling to manage financially .
They praised her pioneering work and said she could help direct the new shelter as a board member .
As the project evolved , it became clear that the government ’s approach was vastly different from Ms. Musabih’s .
It hired a director with a background in management and a more subdued style .
On the grounds of an old rehabilitation center 20 minutes from Dubai with high fences and guards , the new shelter , known as the Dubai Foundation for Women and Children , resembles an American low - security prison .
FBI probing figure linked to 2004 Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ; Accused of forging campaign audit Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday February 6 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The Politico revealed on Wednesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had initiated a probe of a former treasurer of the National Republican Congressional Committee over the forging of a 2006 election audit .
But it left out an important detail : the official in question served as a partner at a firm that was retained by the Swift Boat Veterans and Prioners of War for Truth in 2004 to perform legal compliance work .
A report in Wednesday 's Politico from Patrick O'Connor and John Bresnahan reveals that the NRCC , which raises funds for the political campaigns of House Republicans , is auditing its own books due to what may be an FBI fraud investigation of Christopher J. Ward , who served as NRCC treasurer until Aug. 2007 .
While the Politico report noted that Ward had been serving the NRCC as a private contractor since last year , it failed to note that he was also at one time a partner with the Fairfax , Virginia - based Political Compliance Services , Inc. , a firm that specializes in filing reports with the Federal Election Commission on behalf of political candidates and campaigns .
PCS , Inc. , according to earlier reports , was retained by the Swift Boat Veterans and POWs for Truth in the run-up to the 2004 presidential election .
" Since the spring of 2004 , Swift Boat Veterans for Truth paid Wards firm nearly $ 230,000 for services ranging from database management to website consulting , according to disbursements archived at PoliticalMoneyLine , a nonpartisan website that tracks fundraising , " according to a July 2007 report in The Hill .
Reporter Alexander Bolton also noted that Ward did not directly handle the Swift Boat Vets ' work which was carried out by another Political Compliance Services , Inc. partner .
The Swift Boat Vets played a powerful role in the 2004 presidential election .
The group raised tens of millions of dollars , much of it from major Republican Party donors , and paid for commercials and mailings questioning Democratic Senator John Kerry 's military service record , as well as his anti-war activities after his return from Vietnam .
The group was led by John O'Neill , who had been tasked by figures close to President Richard Nixon in 1971 to publicly challenge peace advocates like Kerry in public settings in the form of the group " Vietnam Veterans for a Just Peace . "
The Swift Boat Vets relied on claims of Vietnam veterans who claimed they knew Kerry and that he was exaggerating his service record , many of which did not hold up to truth .
In Dec. 2006 , the Federal Election Commission levied an almost $ 300,000 fine against the group for breaking federal election laws .
A call to PCS on Wednesday morning confirmed that Ward recently left the firm .
RAW STORY was awaiting further comment from the company .
If Grand Theft Auto IV is anything like the previous iterations , it will offer a robust single - player experience , the kind that can last several hundred hours .
That always worked well in the past , but Rockstar decided that was n't enough this time around and added a sizable multiplayer component .
Here 's the challenge for Rockstar : create a multiplayer experience good enough to convince players to leave the single - player campaign for a little while .
That 's a tall task .
After spending a day checking out four of the MP modes , we 're pretty certain Rockstar 's succeeded .
Riding+tandem+on+a+bike+is+a+whole+lot+of+fun .
see deal Grand Theft Auto IV - PC $ 19.99 on Gamestop
Multiplayer is accessed from the single - player game via Niko 's cell phone and supports up to 16 players .
Oh , and the entire world runs at the same time .
That 's right -- all the pedestrians , traffic and cops are there .
The entire city is open to you and your fifteen friends in apparently every mode .
And that 's what it feels like to have your mind blown .
You wo n't play the story mode in multiplayer .
In fact , no one gets to be Niko online .
Instead , you 'll create a custom character ( dude or babe ) from about a half - dozen options .
While the options we were shown were fairly limited , new clothes and accessories unlock as you rank up .
Ranks run from 0 - 10 , with experience earned by collecting cash in multiplayer .
Cash is dropped by opponents and can be nabbed by anyone and is also automatically earned for performing certain tasks in the various modes .
We did n't get to experience the leveling system , but it appears fairly simple .
It 's meant to reward you for playing a lot of multiplayer , but leveling up your character is n't the focus as it tends to be in Call of Duty 4 and Rainbow Six Vegas 2.
We were n't given a view of the lobby system , but from Rockstar 's hints , it sounds like you will just run around going Bananarama in Liberty City until someone launches a game .
The good news is that when a game is set up , the host has a myriad of options depending on the mode .
This is everything from turning on cops ( yes , you can have a wanted level in multiplayer ) , adjusting the density of traffic , selecting from several weather options ( fog and heavy rain being the coolest ) , time of day , and even what radio station is playing .
We counted sixteen options for one mode and the others had similar amounts .
Playing with eight people , we only had one instance of slowdown .
And that was when all of us were firing RPGs into a crowd of cops .
At that point , the game just sort of threw up it hands and said , " Come on , seriously ? "
Except for this brief moment of slowdown , our hours enjoying GTA IV Before we break down each of the four modes played ( Team Deathmatch , GTA Race , Cops N Crooks and Hangman 's NOOSE ) , there is one significant gameplay change from single - player mode .
When playing MP , your names shows above your head along with a colored dot .
However , if you crouch , your name disappears , making you tougher to spot .
And if you use cover , both your name and dot disappear .
It may sound insignificant , but both bring an unexpected pacing to GTA multiplayer by rewarding you for being strategic in your combat .
Aside from this , the gameplay is basically the same as in single - player .
There is no dumbing down of the game .
So you will be able to take cover , jack cars , climb up buildings , swim , run over pedestrians and toss Molotov cocktails out the window of your car , just as you can with Niko in the main campaign .
No , you wo n't have a main story component , but if you 've trained in single - player , you should be able to do well in multiplayer .
Unless you 're playing against people at Rockstar .
Damn you to hell , Hove Beachin !
April 11 , 2008 — A Tokyo medical team prepares to CT - scan the world 's best preserved mammoth — missing only her tail and shaggy coat .
Completed by February , the resulting 3 - D images ( not yet released to the public ) provide the first detailed look at a prehistoric animal 's insides , Russian scientists announced this week .
A hunter found 37,000 - year - old " Lyuba " in Arctic Russia in May 2007 .
She was later shipped to Tokyo's Jikei University School of Medicine and is now back in Russia for biopsies and detailed genetic analysis .
Researchers hope to sequence the entire mammoth genome from Lyuba and uncover ancient viruses in her tissues .
A CT scan of the baby mammoth Lyuba lights up a monitor at a Tokyo medical school .
A Japanese team captured 3 - D images by February 2008 of individual body parts , such as her liver and heart , though they have not yet been released to the public .
Russian biologist Alexei Tikhonov said , “ Now we can see all the internal organs in their natural positions inside the body .
"
Labels : amazing , Science
Yes , this is amazing .
We see mommoths all the time in animation and on movies like 10,000 BC -- always feeling like just storybook characters no more real than fairies and ogres and unicorns .
But this gave me the feeling like I am actually sharing space with them , just that they are no longer here .
“ Right now , most physicists would predict that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same properties , ” Gerald Gabrielse tells Physorg.com , “ What ’s irresistible is that we of the opportunity to – potentially – look for tiny differences . ”
Gabrielse , a professor at Harvard University , is the leader of the ATRAP Collaboration .
The ATRAP Collaboration consists of an international team that includes others from Harvard , as well as the Forschungszentrum Jülich and the Johannes Gutenberg - Universität in Germany , and York University in Toronto .
ATRAP works with very cold atoms , and has been working on studies in antimatter .
Recently , the ATRAP Collaboration showed that it is possible to create antihydrogen so that it can be trapped within a certain magnetic field .
Their work is published in Physical Review Letters : “ Antihydrogen Production within a Penning - Ioffe Trap . ”
Antimatter is extremely rare ; almost nothing in the universe is made of antimatter .
Besides , when antimatter comes in contact with regular matter , it annihilates , leaving nothing but an energy release .
But antimatter offers an interesting study for many physicists .
“ Our most basic theories predict that antimatter should behave like matter , ” Gabrielse explains .
He and his colleagues believe that they may have found a way to trap antihydrogen so that it can be precisely studied .
“ This is exciting , because many said that it was n’t possible to produce antimatter in the environment that we did . ”
“ We have to take it one step at a time , ” Gabrielse continues .
“ Right now , we ’ve just shown that it ’s possible to create antihydrogen in this region where the magnetic field is at the minimum . ”
He explains the process of creating antihydrogen in the ATRAP technique : First , antiprotons are slowed by lowering their temperatures to close to four degrees above absolute zero .
Positrons are also cooled down .
“ Next , we get the positrons and the antiprotons to interact – we get them to collide , ” Gabrielse says .
“ If we do it at a low enough energy , there is a probability that they will get attached and form an antihydrogen atom . ”
The problem is that , without charge , the antihydrogen does n’t trap very well .
The ATRAP Collaboration overcame this problem by “ creating a trap within a trap , ” Gabrielse explains .
A Penning trap , which is designed for the antiprotons and positrons , is located inside an Ioffe trap with four current - carrying poles .
This creates a region where the magnetic field is at a minimum .
“ Antiydrogen atoms that are cold enough and in the right quantum state will preferentially stay in the place where the magnetic field is lowest , ” Gabrielse explains .
The Ioffe trap is designed to keep the antihydrogen , once it ’s formed , in place .
Gabrielse points out that they do n’t know if they have any trapped antihydrogen yet .
“ Our first step was to show that we could produce it under these conditions .
Some said it could n’t be done , but we did it .
We are working on making colder antihydrogen atoms that are better able to ‘ stick ’ inside the trap . ”
Once this is done , it should be possible to study the properties of antihydrogen and compare them to the properties of hydrogen .
“ If we discover they have different properties , ” Gabrielse says , “ it will have huge implications at a fundamental level .
If we find that they are the same , that reality does conform to theory , it ’s still a winning situation . ”
Even though there are no immediately obvious applications for antihydrogen , Gabrielse believes that this technique may move beyond the study of fundamentals in time :
“ When nuclear magnetic resonance was discovered , Ed Purcell thought it would only be good for studying fundamentals , but now MRIs are used all the time .
Norman Ramsey had no idea that his maser would be incorporated into today ’s GPS technology . ”
“ Our trap designs are now being used by others to analyze pharmaceuticals and our magnet designs are now being used to make MRI magnets that can be located closer to elevators and other sources of changing magnetic fields , ” Gabrielse continues .
“ These discoveries often lead to new inventions and techniques that become part of everyday life and our culture .
It ’s the way science works . ”

Prosecutors first laid out how on that Saturday morning around 4 a.m. , Mr. Bell was leaving Club Kalua in Jamaica , Queens , where he had been celebrating his impending wedding  scheduled for later in the day  with childhood friends and his father .
The detectives were working undercover to make arrests at the club for prostitution or drugs .
The two groups may never have noticed each other if not for a testy exchange between Mr. Bell and another man outside the front door .
Prosecutors said Mr. Bell exchanged words with a man standing near a black sport utility vehicle who had “ muttered his unhappiness ” that Mr. Bell was drunk “ and was overheard , ” Mr. Testagrossa said .
But he said the conversation never escalated and ended without incident .
“ Not a single blow was thrown , and no gun was displayed . ”
The detectives saw the confrontation and decided to follow Mr. Bell .
They have said that they believed some of the men with Mr. Bell were armed .
Detective Isnora trailed Mr. Bell and two of his friends , Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield , to their car , which was parked around the corner from the club , on Liverpool Street .
He did not call for backup as he approached the men , as is standard in undercover operations , Mr. Testagrossa said , and his communication with his team was lax .
Detective Isnora has said that he pinned his police shield to his collar , but Mr. Testagrossa said it may not have been visible to Mr. Bell and his friends , and that rather than shouts of “ Police ! ” witnesses said they heard the detective say , “ Yo , let me holler at you . ”
By that time , the three men were in the car .
Mr. Bell drove forward , striking the detective ’s leg before hitting an unmarked van carrying Detective Oliver and another detective , who was not charged in the case .
Mr. Bell then reversed , hitting a wall before speeding forward and hitting the van again .
Mr. Testagrossa said Mr. Guzman looked at the detective and saw only a man with a gun , and felt a bullet tear into his shoulder before he shouted , “ Let ’s do it ! ” to Mr. Bell , urging him to flee .
Mr. Testagrossa said Detective Oliver began shooting after Detective Isnora , firing 31 shots , with the briefest of pauses to reload .
“ Had he paused to reassess , he would have discovered that no gunfire was coming from the occupants of the vehicle , ” the prosecutor said .
I work in the NYTimes.com feeds team .
We handle retrieving , parsing and transforming incoming feeds from whatever strange proprietary format our partners choose to give us into something that our CMS can digest .
As you can imagine , we deal with a huge amount of text processing .
To handle all of these transformations as efficiently as possible we rely heavily on the magic of Perl .
Recently , as feeds become more and more important , we have begun to feel pains caused by past impromptu segments of inefficient code written to meet quick , episodic deadlines .
A situation that we are especially prone to as a fast moving news organization .
I am a relatively new employee here at NYTimes.com and one of my responsibilities is to create tools to help ensure the integrity and scalability of our code .
To this end , I would like to introduce you to The New York Times Perl Profiler , or Devel : : NYTProf .
The purpose of this tool is to allow developers to easily profile Perl code line - by - line with minimal computational overhead and highly visual output .
With only one additional command , developers can generate robust color - coded HTML reports that include some useful statistics about their Perl program .
Here is the typical usage :
perl -d:NYTProf myslowcode.pl
nytprofhtml
See ?
It ’s easy !
nytprofhtml is an implementation of the included reporting interface ( Devel : : NYTProf : : Reader ) .
If you do n’t want HTML reports , you can implement your own format with relative ease .
If you create something cool , be sure to let me know via CPAN patch request or open@nytimes.com .
Detailed instructions can be found in the documentation and source code on CPAN .
You can see sample screen shots of the html report ’s index pageand a single module report .
Similar tools exist to profile Perl code .
Devel : : DProf is the ubiquitous profiler , but it only collects information about subroutine calls .
Because of this limitation , its not all that helpful in finding that elusive broken regex in a 75 - line subroutine of regex transforms .
Devel : : FastProf is another per-line profiler , however I found its output difficult to coerce into HTML .
It also does n’t support non-Linux systems ( we need at least Solaris and Ubuntu / Linux support ) .
Devel : : NYTProf is available as a distribution on the CPAN .
You may install by typing “ install Devel : : NYTProf ” in the ‘ cpan ’ command - line application , or manually by downloading the tarball from CPAN .
We were able to reduce the long runtime on one particular application by 20 % ( about a minute ) after the very first test run of our profiler .
We hope that you will find our tool as useful as we have .
Of course , any comments and suggestions are welcome !

At least 12 people have been killed in the South African city of Johannesburg since Friday in a wave of violence directed at immigrants , police say .
Police have used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to stop gangs of armed youths from attacking foreigners and looting and burning their property .
Five people were killed overnight in the area of Cleveland .
Two of them were burned and the others beaten to death .
More than 50 were taken to hospitals with gunshot and stab wounds .
During the day , a church where about 1,000 Zimbabweans have been taking refuge was attacked .
In pictures : Johannesburg violence Bishop Paul Veryn of the Central Methodist Church which was attacked told SABC radio : " We consider that the situation is getting so serious that the police can no longer control it . "
As night fell , immigrants were streaming into one police station near downtown Johannesburg carrying whatever belongings they could , reports Caroline Hawley .
Many now fear for their lives , she reports .
One Zimbabwean woman told the BBC she would flee back home rather than risk losing her two children to the mobs .
Social problems Foreigners have been trying to flee the violence
The trouble began a week ago in the sprawling township of Alexandra .
Immigrants from neighbouring African countries were set upon by men with guns and iron bars chanting " kick the foreigners out " .
Terrified Zimbabweans , Mozambicans and Malawians fled to the safety of the local police station and to another township , Diepsloot .
They were then attacked there as well - shacks were burnt down and shops looted .
The violence has since spread to other areas .
Since the end of apartheid , millions of African immigrants have poured into South Africa seeking jobs and sanctuary .
But they have become scapegoats for many of the country 's social problems - its high rate of unemployment , a shortage of housing and one of the worst levels of crime in the world .
Police have been trying to restore order in Diepsloot township The South African Red Cross is now providing food and blankets to hundreds of frightened immigrants forced from their homes .
President Thabo Mbeki said he would set up a panel of experts to investigate the violence .
The leader of the governing African National Congress , Jacob Zuma , condemned the attacks .
" We cannot allow South Africa to be famous for xenophobia , " he told a conference in Pretoria .

The video of Tariq Azizuddin showed him surrounded by armed men Pakistan 's ambassador to Afghanistan , who went missing in February , has appeared in a video saying he is being held by Taleban militants .
Armed men surrounded Tariq Azizuddin in the footage , shown on Dubai - based al - Arabiya television .
He urged Pakistan 's government to meet a demand for an exchange of captives .
It is the first public statement by the envoy since he disappeared in the border area between the two countries , on his way to the Afghan capital Kabul .
In comments translated into Arabic by the channel , Mr Azizuddin said he , along with his driver and his bodyguard , had been kidnapped by " mujahideen from the Taleban " .
He added that they were being held " in comfortable conditions " and " looked after " .
" We have no problems , but I suffer health problems such as high blood pressure and heart pains , " he said .
No escort Appealing directly to Pakistan 's ambassadors in Iran and China and the foreign secretary , he said : " I urge them to do what they can to keep us alive and fulfil all the Taleban 's demands as soon as possible so we can be released and return home , God willing . "
A Taleban spokesman said in February that the group would exchange Mr Azizuddin for a Taleban commander captured by Pakistani security forces .
Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Sadiq told Reuters news agency : " Yes , it is him , but ... we 're not in a position to verify if he's in the custody of the Taleban . "
Mr Sadiq declined to confirm whether the captors had expressed any demands for the envoy 's release .
The issue is very sensitive and we do not want to jeopardise his security by discussing it in too much details , " he said .
Mr Azizuddin was travelling from the north - western Pakistani city of Peshawar when he was abducted .
Many areas in the border region with Afghanistan are strongholds of pro-Taleban militants , and hundreds of people have been kidnapped in recent years .
The envoy said he had been seized in the Khyber area - the quickest way between Peshawar and Kabul .
The historic Khyber Pass is the main trade route supplying reinforcements and supplies to the US and Nato forces in Afghanistan .
It is also one of the best protected areas , with a heavy contingent of tribal police .
Mr Azizuddin is said to have previously travelled to Kabul by road , often without a tribal escort .

Jones Report

Members of We Are Change UK questioned ex-BBC reporter Phil Hayton about the early reporting of WTC 7 ’s collapse during a speaking appearance .
Hayton failed to recollect even being in the studio on the day of 9/11 – at first– but then recalls the situation when it is described in detail , including the actions of Jane Standley , who reported the collapse some 26 minutes in advance with WTC Building 7 still visible in the background .
" A lot of eyebrows were raised , " We Are Change reporters point out in summary , because many saw it as a clear controlled demolition , including a number of engineers .
Hayton responded , pointing out that he was not aware of the situation with WTC 7 .
" This sounds so significant – I ’m just amazed I did n’t know about this …
This is completely news to me . "
" So , is there no official explanation ? " Hayton further probed .
We Are Change continues to explain the delayed NIST report on WTC 7 as well as the response from a BBC editor who claimed 9/11 tapes were " lost " in a ‘ cock - up . ’
" I sense that you think there ’s a conspiracy here – but you might be right , " Hayton concluded .
On a previous occasion , We Are Change UK reporters contacted Jane Standley by phone about the telling incident .
Standley , unlike Hayton , was not surprised by the revelation , but became uncomfortable and hurriedly ended the conversation , only commenting that she had been " harassed " about the situation already .
Surely , it is clear that neither Standley nor Hayton were ‘ in on a conspiracy ’– rather they were used and fed information .
However , Hayton seems willing to admit it while Standley has thus far been unable to answer for the suspicious incident ahead of the unexplained collapse .
The suspicion surrounding early media reporting of WTC7 ’s collapse– which Aaron Brown of CNN also announced– only exacerbates the demolition apparent that many police , fire fighters and other emergency workers were told about in advance and which many other news anchors described as being like a ‘ deliberately destroyed ’ building .
Further , WTC lease holder Larry Silverstein said that the building was " pulled " and rescue worker Kevin McPadden has reported hearing a countdown to Building 7 ’s demolition .

This is a follow - up on the previous entry , the " high - level CPU " challenge .
I 'll try to summarize the replies and my opinion on the various proposals .
But first , a summary of my original points :
" Very " high - level languages have a cost .
Attributing this cost to the underlying hardware architecture is wrong .
You could move the cost from software to hardware , but that would n't eliminate it .
I primarily referred to languages characterized by indirection levels and late binding of user - defined operations , such as Lisp and Python , and to a lesser extent / confidence to side - effect - free languages like Haskell .
I did n't mean to say that high - level languages should not be used , in fact I think that their cost is wildly overestimated by many .
However , denying the existence of any intrinsic cost guarantees that people will keep overestimating it , because if it were n't that high a cost , why would you lie to them ?
I mean it very seriously ; horrible tech marketing is responsible for the death ( or coma ) of many great things .
Of all systems with similar cost and features , the one that has the least stuff implemented in hardware is the best , because you can change more things .
The idea that moving things to hardware is a sure way to make them efficient is a misconception .
Hardware can't do " anything in one cycle " ; there are many constraints involved .
Therefore , it 's better to let the software explicitly control a set of low - level components than build hardware logic implementing high - level interfaces to them .
For example , to add 2 numbers on a RISC machine , you load them to registers , then add .
You could have a command adding operands from memory ; it would n't run faster , because the hardware would have to spend cycles on loading operands to ( implicit ) registers .
Hardware does n't have to be a RISC machine , but it 's always better to move as much control to software as possible under the given system cost constraints .
I basically asked people to refute point 1 ( " HLLs are costly " ) .
What follows describes the attempts people made at it .
Computers you can't program
Several readers managed to ignore my references to specific high - level languages and used the opportunity to pimp hardware architectures that can't run those languages .
Or any other programming languages designed for human beings , for that matter .
Example architectures :
It is my opinion that the fans of this family of hardware / vaporware , consistent advocates of The New Age of Computing , have serious AI problems .
Here 's a sample quote on cellular automata : " I guess they really are like us . "
Well , if you want to build a computing device in order to have a relationship with it , maybe a cellular automaton will do the trick .
Although I 'd recommend to first check the fine selection of Homo Sapiens we have here on Planet Earth .
Because those come with lots of features you 'd like in a friend , a foe , a spouse or an employee already built - in , while computer hardware has a certain gap to fill in this department .
Me , I want to build machines to do stuff that someone " like us " would n't want to do , for any of the several reasons ( the job is hard / boring / stinky / whatever ) .
And once I 've built them , I want people to be able to use them .
Please note this last point .
People and other " nature 's computers " , like animals and fungi , are n't supposed to be " used " .
In fact , all those systems spend a huge amount of resources to avoid being used .
Machines are n't supposed to be like that .
Machines are supposed to do what you want .
Which means that both the designer and the user need to control them .
Now , a computer that can't even be tricked into parsing HTML in a straightforward way does n't look like it 's built to be controlled , does it ?
Let me supply you with an example : Prolog .
Prolog is an order of magnitude more tame than a neural net ( and two orders of magnitude compared to a cellular automaton ) when it comes to " control " – you can implement HTML parsing with it .
But Prolog does show alarming signs of independence – it spends most of its time in its inference engine , an elaborate mechanism running lengthy non-trivial loops , which sometimes turn out to be infinite .
You are n't supposed to single - step those loops ; you 're supposed to specify truths about your world , and Prolog will derive more truths for you .
Prolog was supposed to be the wave of the future about 25 years ago .
I think it can be safely called dead by now , despite the fair amount of money poured into it .
I think it died because it 's extremely frustrating to use – you just can't tell why the hell it worked that way in each particular case .
I 've never seen anything remotely as annoying as Prolog , with the notable exception of Makefiles , running on top of a wonderful inference engine of their own .
My current opinion is that neural networks rarely deserve a special hardware implementation – if you need them , build a more traditional computer and run them on top of that ; and cellular automata are just stillborn .
I might be wrong in the sense that a hardware implementation of these models is the optimal solution for some problem , hence we 'll see those beasts in some corner of a successful real - world system .
But the vast majority of computing , including AI apps , will run on machines that support basic bread - and - butter programmer things simply and straightforwardly .
Here 's a Computing Technology Acceptance Lower Bound for ya : if you can't parse a frigging log file with it , you can't do anything with it .
Self - assembly computers
Our next contestant is a machine that you surely can program , once you 've built it from the pieces which came in the box .
Some people mentioned " FPGA " , others failed to call it by its name ( one comment mentioned a " giant hypercube of gates " , for example ) .
In this part , I 'm talking about the suggestions to use an FPGA without further advice on exactly how it should be used ; that is , FPGA as the architecture , not FPGA used to prototype an architecture .
Maybe people think that with an FPGA , " everything is possible " , so in particular , you could easily build a processor efficiently implementing a HLL .
Well , FPGA is just a way to implement hardware allowing you to trade NRE for unit cost .
And with hardware , some things are possible and some are n't , or so I claim – for example , you can't magically make the cost of HLLs go away .
If you can't think of a way to reduce the overhead HLLs impose on the system cost , citing FPGA does n't make your argument look any better .
On the contrary – you 've saved NRE , but you 've raised the cost of the hardware by the factor of 5 .
Another angle : can you build a compiler ?
Probably so .
Would you like to start your project with building a compiler ?
Probably not .
Now , what makes people think that they want to build hardware themselves ?
I really do n't know .
Building hardware is gnarly , FPGA or not – there are lots of constraints you have to think about to make the thing efficient , and it 's extremely easy to err on the side of not having enough flexibility .
The latter typically happens because you try to implement overly high - level interfaces ; it then turns out that you need the same low - level components to do something slightly different .
And changing hardware is n't quite as easy as changing software , even with FPGA , because hardware description code , with its massive parallelism and underlying synthesis constraints , is fairly tricky .
FPGA is a perfectly legitimate platform for hardware vendors , but an awful interface for application programmers .
If you deliver FPGAs , make it your implementation detail ; giving it to application programmers is n't very likely to make them happy in the long run .
At the other end of the spectrum , there 's the kind of " self - assembly computer " that reassembles itself automatically , " adapting to the user 's needs " .
Even if it made any sense ( and it does n't ) , it still would n't answer the question : how should this magical hardware adapt to handle HLLs , for example , indirect memory access ?
Actual computers designed to run HLLs
Some people mentioned actual hardware which was built to run HLLs , including Reduceron , Tcl on Board , Lisp Machines , Rekursiv , and ARM's Jazelle instruction set .
For some reason , nobody mentioned Intel 's 432 , an object - oriented microprocessor which was supposed to replace x86 , but was , among other things , too slow .
This illustrates that the existence of a " high - level processor " does n't mean that it was a good idea ( of course it does n't mean the opposite , either ) .
I 'll now talk about these machines in increasing order of my confidence that the architecture does n't remove the overhead posed by the HLL it 's supposed to run .
Reduceron is designed to run Haskell , and focuses on an optimization problem I was n't even aware of , that of graph reduction .
One of the primary ideas seem to be that graph reduction does n't suffer from dependency problems which could inhibit parallelization , but still can't be parallelized on stock CPUs .
That 's because a lot of memory access is involved , and there 's typically little load / store bandwidth available to a CPU compared to its data processing capability .
Well , I agree with this completely in the sense that memory access is the number one area where custom hardware design can help ; more on that later .
However , I 'm not sure that the right way to go about it is to build a " Haskell Machine " ; building a lower - level processor with lots of bandwidth available to it could be better .
Then again , it could be worse , and my confidence level in this area is extremely low , which is why I list the Reduceron before the others : I think I 'll look into this whole business some more .
Pure functional languages are a weak spot of mine ; for now , I can only say three things for sure : ( 1 ) side effects are a huge source of bugs , ( 2 ) although they get in the way of optimizers , side effects are a poor man 's number one source of optimizations , so living without them is n't easy , and ( 3 ) the Reduceron is a pretty cool project .

Tcl on Board was built to run a Tcl dialect .
Tcl does n't pose optimization problems that languages like Lisp or Python do – it's largely a procedural language grinding flat objects .
And there 's another thing I ought to tell you : I do n't like Tcl .
However , I think that this Tcl chip is kind of insightful , because it 's designed for low - end applications .
And the single biggest win of having a " high - level " instruction set is to save space on program encoding .
Several people mentioned it as a big deal ; I do n't think of it as a big deal , because instruction caches always worked great for me ( ~90 % hits without any particular optimizations ) .
However , for really small systems of the low - end embedded kind , program encoding is a real issue .
I 'm not saying that Tcl on Board is a good ( or a bad ) idea by itself ; I know nothing about these things .
I 'm just saying that while I think high - level hardware will fail to deliver speed gains , it might give you space gains , so it may be the way to go for really small systems which are n't supposed to scale .
Not that I know much about those systems , except that if I 'd have to build one , I 'd seriously consider Forth …

Not that I know much about those systems , except that if I 'd have to build one , I 'd seriously consider Forth … Lisp Machines ran Lisp , and Rekursiv ran LINGO , which apparently was somewhat similar to Smalltalk .
This I know .
What I do n't know is how the hardware support for the high - level features would eliminate the cost overhead of the HLLs involved ; that 's because I do n't know the architecture , and nobody gave much detail .
I do n't see a way to solve the fundamental problems .
I mean , if I want to support arrays of bytes , then each byte must be tagged , does n't it ?
And if I only support fixnums larger than bytes , then I 'd waste space , right ?
And just what could the LispM do about the hairy binding done by CLOS behind the scenes ?
Again , this does n't mean these machines were n't a good idea ; in fact I wish my desktop hardware were more expensive and more secure , and tagged architectures could help .
All I 'm saying is that it would be more expensive .
I think .
I 'd like to hear more about LispM , simply because most people who used it seem to be very fond of it – I know just one exception .

Jazelle is supposed to run Java .
Java is significantly lower - level than Lisp or Smalltalk .
It still is a beautiful example , because the hardware support in this case yields little performance benefits .
In fact MIPS reported that a software implementation of JVM running on a MIPS core outperformed a JVM using Jazelle by a factor of about 2 . I 've never seen a refutation of that .
Stock computers with bells and whistles
Finally , there was a bunch of suggestions to add specific features to traditional processors .
Content - addressable memory is supposed to speed up associative array look - ups .
There 's a well - known aphorism by Alan Perlis – " A language that does n't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing " .
Here 's my attempt at an aphorism : " A processor that does n't affect the way you access memory is not worth building " .
This makes the wide variety of tools designed to help you build a SIMD VLIW machine with your own data processing instructions uninteresting to me , and on the other hand , makes CAM quite appealing .
I came to believe that your biggest problem is n't processing the data , it 's fetching the data .
I might talk about it some time ; the Reduceron , essentially designed to solve a memory access problem preventing the optimization of a " perfectly parallelizable " algorithm , is one example of this .
However , CAM goes way beyond providing more bandwidth or helping with the addressing – it adds comparison logic to each memory word .
While it sounds impractical to replace all of your RAM with CAM , stashing a CAM array somewhere inside your system could help with some problems .
Then again , it wo n't necessarily pay off – it depends on the exact details of what you 're doing .
All I can say at this point is that it 's a Worthy Idea , which , for some reason , I keep forgetting about , and I should n't .

GC / reference counting optimizations .
Maybe I 'm wildly wrong , but I do n't think the garbage is a big deal , ' cause how much time do you spend on garbage collection compared to plain malloc / free ?
The way I see it , the problem is n't so much with the overhead of garbage collection as it is with the amount of small objects allocated by the system and , most importantly , the amount of indirect memory accesses .
I learned that some Lisp compilers can do object inlining with varying amounts of user intervention ; well , when it works out , it removes the need for special hardware support .
The thing is , I think the main battle here is to flatten objects , not to efficiently get rid of them .
And I think that it 's quite clearly software that should fight that battle .

Regular expression and string functions in hardware : I do n't think it 's worth the trouble , because how much time do you spend in regex matching anyway ?
Maybe it 's because I do n't process massive volumes of text , but when I do process the moderate amounts of text I bump into , there 's the part where you store your findings in data structures , and I think it might be the bottleneck .
And then a huge amount of data comes from places like RDBMSes where you do n't have to parse much .
You 'd end up with idle silicon , quietly leaking power .
The good stuff
At the bottom line , there were two hardware - related things which captured my intoxicated imagination : the Reduceron and content - addressable memories .
If anything ever materializes around this , I 'll send out some samples .
In the meanwhile – thanks !
Programming
If a programming language was a boat …
This one is inspired by a recent forum post , that still leaves me in amazement .
Hi , Im wondering how i can create a boat in turing and if someone can post a example .
This makes no sense , since one does n’t normally make water vehicles in Turing , the programming language .
Though this got me thinking — if a programming language was a boat , what would it be ?
Turing
Turing would definitely be a kayak ( thank you for comments ) .
It ’s small .
It ’s human powered .
It ’s often used as a beginner “ boat ” .
And it ’s also very Canadian .

Java
Java is a cargo ship .
It ’s very bulky .
It ’s very enterprise~y .
Though it can also carry a lot of weight .
Will carry a project , but not very fun to drive .

Perl
Perl is a tugboat .
Powerful enough to tug Java around , in 80 characters or less .

Ruby
Ruby is difficult to describe .
It ’s sleek , sexy , and very fun to drive .
Here ’s a picture .
Very trendy .

PHP
PHP is a bamboo raft .
A series of hacks held together by string .
Still keeps afloat though .

C is a nuclear submarine .
The instructions are probably in a foreign language , but all of the hardware itself is optimized for performance .

INTRODUCTION
The aim of this site is an attempt to uncover the history of the Welrod pistol , as well as the distribution and use of it , during the German occupation of Denmark .
There are only a handful of reports and descriptions regarding the use of this pistol , which most likely accounts for the fact that the Welrod to this day remains relatively unknown .
Welrod MkIIA © Anders Thygesen .
Cross sectioned , note the projectile in the first rubber baffle .
Alas , in my view , the Welrod pistol gained an unjust reputation for being unreliable and lacking sufficient " power " .
But keeping in mind the purpose for which it was built , and accepting the inherent limitations of such a design , it entirely fulfilled its role .
The Welrod pistol in my opinion is an exceptional piece of weapons - technology .
The Welrod was produced in three basic versions : the Mk.II and Mk.IIA , chambered the .32 ACP round , and the Mk.I , chambered for the 9 mm Parabellum .
I find the Mk.II and Mk.IIA , .32 ACP , to be the more interesting of the two , as it was the only version to be delivered to the Danish Resistance .
However , in the interest of thoroughness , I have chosen to also bring a full description of the Mk.I .
The original history behind the development and production of the Welrod pistol has proven hard to trace .
Most of the information regarding the origins of the pistol has either disappeared , or has been destroyed .
Although the identity of the manufacturer is still not officially confirmed , copies of the original drawings carrying the B.S.A. stamp , has recently surfaced proving that B.S.A. was in fact the main contractor on the project .
Besides just recently a friend of mine Brian Moyse , told me about an early reference to the Welrod pistol that stemmed all the way back to July 1946 .
It is in the book “ The Other Battle ” telling the history of B.S.A. written by Donovan M. Ward .
How that slipped through the censor in 1945 is most puzzling , but it is reasonable to believe that B.S.A. got away with it because at that time the Ministry staff were more preoccupied with other matters .
On page 147 in Chapter XXIII , Rush Jobs - And Others :
" Special weapons for Resistance Forces in Europe , R.A.F. bomber turrets , shell cases , gun carriages , field gun trundlers - these and a host of other munitions were manufactured by B.S.A. during the war in addition to the armaments already described .
One of the most deadly weapons used by members of the French Resistance Movement against the occupying German forces in the months before D - day was manufactured at Small Heath .
This was the Welrod Silent Pistol .
Although from 1942 onwards the French were receiving regular supplies of normal military arms and ammunition dropped at night by parachute from R.A.F. planes , these were only of use in regular warfare .
There was an obvious need for a weapon with which the war of nerves could be carried into the dance halls and cafes frequented by German officers and men ; and it had to be a weapon which would give the user a chance to escape after an " execution " .
Late in 1943 the War Office asked B.S.A. to manufacture a pistol , which had been specially designed by an army major .
In the matter of silence it was the most perfect gun of its kind ever evolved , for when the tip of the muzzle was pressed into a sandbag and a shot fired , there was only the faintest noise , which would pass unnoticed in the normal chatter and clatter of a cafe .
To enable it to be manufactured quickly on the large scale required , the company 's experts simplified the design .
Within six weeks the first batch was on its way to France , and with them a new reign of terror was instituted against the men who were shooting hostages by the score and wiping out whole villages just as they had earlier exterminated Lidice in Czechoslovakia . "
In addition to the commonly available literature on the subject , I have obtained information part through correspondence with museums and different authorities , and part with the assistance of fellow - minded people throughout the world with a shared interest in historical weaponry .
In the end , the accumulated material has been pieced together to relatively form a whole .
Pentagon says it mistakenly shipped ballistic missile parts to Taiwan
The Pentagon has announced that it mistakenly shipped non-nuclear ballistic missile components to Taiwan from a U.S. Air Force base in Wyoming .
It said the items have been returned to the United States .
At a Pentagon news conference , Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne said the misshipped items were four nose cone assemblies for ICBMs .
He also said they were delivered to Taiwan in March 2005 and had been sent instead of helicopter batteries that had been ordered by Taiwan .
" This could not be construed as being nuclear material .
It is a component for the fuse in the nosecone for a nuclear system , " Wynne said .
" We are very concerned about it . "
Wynne said the matter is under investigation .
He said the Taiwanese authorities notified U.S. officials of the mistake .
Neither the Chinese Embassy nor Taiwan diplomats in Washington immediately responded to requests for comment .
Ryan Henry , the No. 2 policy official in the office of Defense Secretary Robert Gates , said President Bush was notified of the mistake and the actions to recover the items .
Henry called the mistake " disconcerting " and intolerable .
He said the Chinese government has been notified of the error .
Henry said an examination of the site in Taiwan where the components had been stored after delivery indicated that they had not been tampered with .
He said the components were " quite dated , " as part of a system designed in the 1960s .
( with wire reports )
This video is from CNN's Newsroom , broadcast March 25 , 2008 .
As the photo editor for Wired News , where the stories and galleries are constantly streaming in , I do n't often get to reflect on the images we put up after they 've been published .
So this particular year in review was a pleasant change of pace .
2007 has seen a lot of excellent galleries on the site ( and some real duds ) but these are my favorite chosen from our most popular .
### 10 . BSOD Through the Ages
One of our most popular galleries this year , this feature gives a brief history of the Blue Screen of Death and shows how it pops up in some of the most unlikely places .
### 9 . Star Trek 's 10 Cheesiest Classic Creatures
This gallery has three of my favorite elements :
Geeky nostalgia , Lore Sjoberg 's wit and bad costumes .
One wonders if the plots or the props came first in these episodes .
### 8 . Planetary Imagery : 30 Years From Voyager Spacecraft
Simply stunning images from the Voyager missions .
We had a difficult time keeping this gallery to 24 images .
### 7 . Best Transformers Fan Photos
I was a huge Transformers fan as a kid – I had Transformers bedding and watched the original animated movie every weekend – so it was fantastic to see all my old favorite toys .
Some of the collections people sent in were very impressive .
### 6 . Best of Burning Man
Reinventing society in the desert is n't the easiest event to cover , but photographer Lane Hartwell snuck out some spectacular shots that really captured the essence of the art exhibits there .
Her night photographs and aerial shots from the Playa are some of the best we 've seen anywhere .
### 5 . Steam - Driven Dreams : The Wondrously Whimsical World of Steampunk
For every web trend , there 's an intangible critical mass of interest that percolates , boils over and then fizzles .
We may have missed the boiling point of Steampunk on this gallery , but it 's still my favorite piece on the subject .
### 4 . Endless Assembly Lines and Giant Cafeterias ; Inside China 's Vast Factories
Ed Burtynsky magnanimously contributed his striking photos of industrial China to Wired.com and gave us some insight into his experiences there .
I think the scale of the photos is more educational than any news story I 've read on China 's growth .
### 3 . The Lost Arcade Games of the Soviet Union
Resurrected communist video games housed in a bomb shelter ?
We should 've known it would be a Wired hit .
The photos are flat and low quality , but they 're fitting of the simple machines and their unglamorous home .
### 2 . NSFW Gallery : Blu - Ray Porn , Mechanized Masturbation and Upskirts at Japan's First Sex Show
Anything with " sex " in the title tends to get a lot of interest from readers , but I think this gallery was popular because it was an honest snapshot of Japanese sexuality that did n't fetishize it .
The hand - crafted statues , the Clitoraid exhibit and the flower shop lady were things I would n't expect to find at an adult expo in the U.S .
### 1 . The ' Winners ' of the Wired News Saddest - Cubicle Contest
This contest turned out to be a huge hit .
Though we suspected many of our readers toiled away in cubicle hell , we were surprised by the overwhelming response to the gallery .
Reader submitted photos are some of our favorites , and they can be some of the most compelling images we have on the site due to their voyeuristic quality .
Turkey and Thailand have in the past also banned access to the site
The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority has told internet service providers ( ISPs ) to restore access to the site , according to a spokeswoman .
Google , the owner of YouTube , confirmed service had been restored in Pakistan .
The attempt to block the site , reportedly because of a " blasphemous " video clip , caused a near global blackout of the site on Sunday .
A spokesman for YouTube told the BBC News website : " We are pleased to confirm that YouTube is again accessible in Pakistan . "
It is reported that a trailer for a forthcoming film by Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders , which portrays Islam in a negative light , was behind the restrictions .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Using religious beliefs as a reason to block websites is completely unacceptable John , UK
The ban was instigated by Pakistan on Friday .
At the time , the BBC News website 's technology editor , Darren Waters , said that to block citizens from accessing YouTube it was believed Pakistan Telecom " hijacked " the web server address of the popular video site .
Those details were then passed on to the country 's internet service providers so that anyone in Pakistan attempting to go to YouTube was instead re-directed to a different address .
But the details of the " hijack " were leaked out into the wider internet by Hong - Kong based provider PCCW and as a result YouTube was mistakenly blocked by other ISPs around the world .
The fact YouTube is back in action makes me revise my thoughts on the clash between governments and freedom of speech
Rory Cellan- Jones
Read Rory 's blog
The block on the servers was lifted once PCCW had been told of the issue by YouTube engineers .
A statement from Google said that the problems lasted for " about two hours " .
" Traffic to YouTube was routed according to erroneous internet protocols , and many users around the world could not access our site , " it said .
A leading net professional told BBC News : " This was probably a simple mistake by an engineer at Pakistan Telecom .
There 's nothing to suggest this was malicious . "
IP hijacking involves taking over a web site 's unique address by corrupting the internet 's routing tables , which direct the flow of data around the world .
Other countries that have temporarily blocked access to YouTube include Turkey and Thailand .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr threatened " open war , " against the American " occupiers " and not the Iraqi government , according to a letter read by a top aide during Friday prayers .
Supporters of Muqtada al - Sadr hold up his photo before noon prayers in Baghdad 's Sadr City on Friday .
" When we threatened to declare an open war until the liberation , we meant war against the occupier , " al - Sadr said in his letter .
" There is no war between us and our Iraqi brothers -- no matter what their nationality , race or sect .
The blood of Iraqis are forbidden on you . "
He encouraged not only his Mehdi Army militia to fight U.S. troops , but also every Iraqi , including the nation 's security forces which are in league with U.S. troops .
" I direct my speech to all government security forces and others , and all the religious and political forces , if this open war is between us and the occupier , you should not interfere in the favor of the occupier , " the letter said .
" We want to liberate you and your lands from the occupiers , so our government would be a full sovereign government . "
On Saturday , al - Sadr issued what he called a " last warning " and told his followers in Sadr City to fight the " occupier " there .
Despite the threat , al - Sadr has a freeze on Mehdi Army military activities , said Saleh al - Ageili , a spokesman for Sadr 's parliamentary bloc .
Al - Sadr said earlier this month that if he called off the freeze , he would issue a separate statement , al - Ageili said .
Al - Sadr praised members of his Mehdi Army for obeying the freeze in his letter Friday .
" The enemy is waiting for the chance to attack you , " al - Sadr said .
" Damn the occupier and his work , which raised the hand of violence and death against your children , women , elders and your scholars . "
He continued , " And you -- still patient -- you showed the clear , white face of al - Sadr and his family , and you have been the people of peace , the people of Islam . "
Al - Sadr said he would not accept the long - term agreement which the U.S. and Iraqi governments are crafting to replace the current U.N. mandate for multi-national forces in Iraq .
The U.N. mandate expires in December .
" There should be no long - term security agreement between the government and occupier , no matter how hard they fight us and no matter how much of our blood is spilled , " he said .
" We will not accept to divide Iraq and to steal its wealth . "
Al - Sadr 's supporters have accused Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki 's government of not holding up its end of the cease - fire agreement , which includes freeing non-convicted prisoners from the Sadrist movement and halting what they call " illegal " raids on the cleric 's followers .
Al - Sadr 's message came after at least 11 people were killed and 36 others were wounded in overnight battles in northern Baghdad 's Sadr City neighborhood , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said .
U.S. - backed Iraqi forces and fighters loyal to al - Sadr have been fighting for several weeks in the sprawling Shiite slum .
The U.S. military launched overnight airstrikes on Sadr City , the official said .
Violence in Sadr City reduced somewhat after al - Sadr called on his supporters to halt attacks on March 30 , but it 's still heavy , the U.S. military said .
Other developments
• Tariq Aziz , one of the best - known faces of Saddam Hussein 's former regime in Iraq , will go on trial Tuesday with six other defendants for their alleged roles in the execution of dozens of Iraqi merchants in 1992 .
Iraqi prosecutor Jaafar al - Moussawi said the merchants , summoned to the Interior Ministry , were blamed for rising prices , given a one - day trial and sentenced to death .
Aziz 's lawyer , Badee Aref , says his client had nothing to do with the executions .
• A minivan carrying five armed men exploded Friday afternoon near an Iraqi army checkpoint in northern Baghdad , wounding three soldiers and killing the men in the car , an Interior Ministry official told CNN .
The official said the men began firing guns after the soldiers gestured for the vehicle to stop .
The minivan exploded when the soldiers fired back , the official said .
• Four masked gunmen shot and killed a journalist working for a Basra radio station run by a Shiite political party , a police official said .
Jassim al - Batat , 38 , was driving his car Friday when gunmen opened fire as they drove past him in Qurmat - Ali , just north of Basra , the official said .
Since the war began in March 2003 , 157 journalists and 54 media assistants have been killed in Iraq , Reporters Without Borders said .
• The U.S. military also said a U.S. soldier was killed by a roadside bomb south of Baghdad Thursday .
The death brings to 4,051 the number of U.S. military personnel killed in the Iraq war since it began in March 2003 .

FOR THE RECORD :
Military medical malpractice :
An article in Sunday ’s Section A about military medical personnel being immune from malpractice lawsuits said Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - Alpine ) had served as a fighter pilot .
He was an Army infantry officer in Vietnam . —
A student nurse assisting an understaffed anesthesia team tried to resuscitate Witt and failed .
Inexplicably , Witt ’s gurney was wheeled into a pediatric area .
Lifesaving devices sized for children , not a 175 - pound adult , proved useless , according to an internal report on the incident .
Medical personnel at David Grant Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base screamed at each other .
A double dose of a powerful stimulant was mistakenly administered .
When a breathing tube was finally inserted , it was misdirected , uselessly pumping air into the patient ’s stomach .
Errors compounded errors and delays multiplied .
By the time a breathing tube finally was inserted correctly , Witt had devastating brain damage .
Three months later , he was removed from life support and died .
Witt , who grew up in Oroville , Calif. , left behind a wife and two children , including a 4 - month - old son .
“ This medical incident was due to an avoidable error , ” concluded an unpublished internal report , a copy of which was reviewed by The Times .
Despite questionable medical care criticized in the report , the bereaved family could not sue for malpractice because Witt was an active - duty airman .
Under limits stemming from a Supreme Court ruling nearly 60 years old , military hospitals and their staffs are immune from malpractice claims -- even for the most egregious lapses -- if the victim is an enlisted member on active duty .
A series of court rulings since 1950 have upheld the original decision , known as Feres vs. United States , denying members of the military the right to sue for damages over medical errors or even deliberate wrongs .
Barbara Cragnotti of Medford , Ore. , learned of the Feres case after her son Joseph suffered lung and neurological injuries from undiagnosed pneumonia while under a military doctor ’s care .
Joseph Cragnotti was in the Navy and had nearly completed training for submarine duty when he was stricken .
Military medical personnel failed to provide antibiotics , and her son ended up having multiple surgeries .
He lost part of a lung .
His mother said his condition deteriorated further after doctors at the naval hospital in Bremerton , Wash . , took the sailor off a needed drug , causing seizures and permanent neurological damage .
Joseph Cragnotti , now 28 , has left the military but still needs treatment for his medical conditions .
His mother joined VERPA -- Veterans Equal Rights Protection Advocacy -- a nonprofit group determined “ to expose and remedy ” what it calls “ the un-American Feres doctrine . ”
Barbara Cragnotti , now head of the organization , foresees more trouble as wounded troops from Iraq and Afghanistan strain a taxed military health system .
“ Congress is not going to act until the public forces them to , ” she said .
The military medical establishment is “ hiding behind the Feres doctrine . ”
Christine Lemp , whose husband , James , 35 , died after receiving questionable medical care at Missouri ’s Ft. Leonard Wood , said accountability was lacking .
“ One of the most disturbing things is that these doctors can do anything and nothing happens , ” she said .
Army Capt .
James Lemp was diagnosed with a stomach virus in 2003 .
Hours later , he was brain - dead from a stroke - like condition called vertebral artery dissection .
Experts hired by his wife said that with proper treatment , he would have had a 90 % chance of recovery .
Defending the doctrine
Feres supporters say the doctrine is necessary to protect the military from costly , time - consuming trials that could compromise military discipline .
Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - Alpine ) , a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a former fighter pilot , called Feres “ a reasonable approach to ensuring that litigation does not interfere with the objectives and readiness of our nation ’s military . ”
For years , the Department of Justice and the Pentagon have joined forces to fend off legal and legislative challenges to Feres .
“ Nobody wants some judge meddling in military matters , ” Paul Harris , then a deputy associate attorney general , told a Senate committee in 2002 .
“ It would have dire implications . ”
Harris , now in private practice , said he stood by his position that “ it would be unconscionable to subject the military to an adversarial civil trial process . ”
But fresh attempts to repeal Feres are in the works , spurred in part by the case of Marine Sgt. Carmelo Rodriguez .
In January , a CBS News TV crew had just arrived to interview him when Rodriguez -- holding the hand of his 7 - year - old son -- died .
Rodriguez , 29 , an Iraq war veteran from New York , had been ravaged by cancer that he and his family blamed on years of misdiagnoses .
Military doctors had mistaken a deadly melanoma for a wart .
His case prompted Rep. Maurice D. Hinchey ( D - N.Y. ) to promise renewed efforts to overturn Feres .
Previous bills have passed easily in the House but died in the Senate .
“ No service member should ever become sick or die as the result of poor military medical care , ” Hinchey said .
“ I believe our military has outstanding doctors , but if those doctors fail our men and women in uniform , then there must be some system of accountability . ”
Military is ‘ sole remedy ’
One former military doctor told The Times that military medical staffs were well aware that Feres shielded them from malpractice claims by active - duty patients or their survivors .
The doctor , who spoke on the condition that he not be identified , served on the medical staff at Travis Air Force Base .
He said staff shortages were chronic there and at other Air Force installations where he worked .
Under such circumstances , he said , “ they ’ll take anyone . ”
James B. Smith , a New Jersey lawyer who served as a military trial judge during a 30 - year service career , said the theory behind Feres was that since the military provided full medical care for members and lifelong veterans benefits , there was little practical need for financial damages for malpractice .
“ The military is already providing for you , and that ’s your sole remedy , ” Smith said .
The 1950 Feres decision encompassed three separate cases .
One involved a soldier named Rudolph J. Feres who died in a fire caused by a faulty barracks heating system .
The others were the victims of medical malpractice .
One had sued after a towel nearly 3 feet long was discovered in his abdomen , left there by military surgeons .
The court was interpreting the Federal Tort Claims Act , which gives citizens a limited right to sue the government for wrongs resulting from the actions of federal employees or agencies .
But the Supreme Court , in a unanimous opinion by Justice Robert H. Jackson , reasoned that active - duty members of the military could seek other remedies for such wrongs , including Veterans Administration benefits .
“ The compensation system , which normally requires no litigation , is not negligible , ” Jackson wrote .
The Supreme Court came within a single vote of overturning Feres in 1987 .
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in the dissenting opinion for the four - member minority : “ Feres was wrongly decided and heartily deserves the ‘ widespread , almost universal criticism ’ it has received . ”
Among the curious aspects of Feres is that it bars malpractice suits by active - duty military personnel but not by their spouses or other family members , who also are entitled to treatment at military hospitals .
“ It does n’t make any sense , ” said Washington - based lawyer Eugene Fidell .
“ If a doctor malpractices on a dependent on one day , the family can sue .
But if he commits the same malpractice the next day on a GI , they can ’t . ”
An investigative panel convened by the Air Force shortly after Witt ’s surgery concluded in its still - unreleased report that “ due to assignments , deployments and recent ill health , ” the anesthesia unit at the Travis Air Force Base hospital was badly understaffed .
“ There is insufficient manning to support operational tempo and the teaching mission of the hospital , ” the report said .
It found that the authorized complement of seven anesthesiologists was down to four available for duty .
“ This medical incident was due to an avoidable error , ” the report said .
“ The practice of anesthesia at a medical center should not rely on the minimum standard . ”
In response , Travis officials said the hospital could increase its anesthesia unit only if the Pentagon provided additional personnel .
Base officials declined to comment on any aspect of the Witt case , citing privacy restrictions .
Legal challenge
Despite the long legal odds , Witt ’s widow , Alexis , is determined to challenge Feres in court .
This month she was formally notified that her administrative claim against the Air Force had been declined , an expected rejection that exhausted all options but litigation .
“ As a family , ” said her sister Carmen Voegeli , a Marine veteran , “ we have a right to know what happened .
How dare the military use these men and take away their rights . ”
One haunting coincidence that could be a factor in the Witt family ’s challenge of Feres involves a nurse anesthetist who helped treat the airman .
After Witt ’s death , her license was revoked by the state of California for “ negligence and / or incompetence . ”
The same anesthetist had been on duty a year earlier when 22 - year - old Texas airman Christopher
White died after routine surgery on his shoulder .
As in the Witt case , post - surgery care of White was criticized by the state nursing board .
White ’s family did not try to take legal action .
If it had , that might have brought attention sooner to problems in the anesthesia unit .
His father , Harris
White , said lawyers had advised him that he could not sue because of the Feres doctrine .
One question is whether senior Democrats who are trusted by the candidate and her husband will ask her to consider quitting the race  politically savvy elected officials such as Gov. Edward Rendell of Pennsylvania or Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey , or friends with wide connections in the Democratic Party , such as Vernon Jordan or Robert Rubin .
( Mr. Rendell and spokeswomen for him and Mr. Corzine did not return phone calls on Tuesday night . )
“ I would n’t be surprised at all if a Rendell or a Vernon Jordan was prepared to weigh in with the Clintons , because the path to the nomination is just looking tougher for us , ” said one top fund - raiser for Mrs. Clinton and longtime friend of the couple , who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe his mood and that some other fund - raisers .
“ Many of us thought she had to win both Indiana and North Carolina to show that she could pull off surprises now in order to pull off the biggest surprise of all  winning the nomination despite being behind right now , ” this fund - raiser added .
“ And she did n’t . ”
Some independent political analysts said Tuesday night that it is almost a certainty  at this late stage of a primary campaign , with 50 primaries and caucuses concluded and only 6 left  that the Clintons and their closest supporters would at least discuss whether she should continue to battle Mr. Obama .
It may only further weaken him if he emerges as the nominee ; tarnish him in potential swing states that still have primaries , such as West Virginia ; and also hurt Mrs. Clinton ’s chances of being selected as his running mate .
“ The campaign may go on but the contest is now over : Obama is the Democratic nominee for president , ” said Robert Shrum , a Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser to the Gore and Kerry presidential campaigns .
“ Now the decision for her is how she wants to end this .
“ The people who have her best interests at heart , they would now say to her , ‘ You ought to really think about not protracting this , because you will only look selfish in the weeks to come , ’ ” Mr. Shrum said .
“ Her Pennsylvania win bought her permission to go on .
But then her narrow victory in Indiana and this smashing defeat in North Carolina  there is no rationale for her to continue . ”
One Clinton adviser called the North Carolina loss in particular “ a very significant turning point ” because Mrs. Clinton , the former president and some of their advisers had become so excited about their prospects of a surprise victory there .
Instead Mr. Obama beat her there by about 15 percentage points .
About the author
( NewsTarget ) Phytochemical - rich foods , such as blueberries , are not only healthy food choices , they may actually be able to reverse age - related memory problems .
That 's the conclusion of a study by a research team from the University of Reading and the Peninsula Medical School in England .
The researchers ( from the Schools of Food Biosciences and Psychology in Reading and the Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences at the Peninsula Medical School in Exeter ) supplemented a regular diet with blueberries over a three month period .
Within three weeks , they discovered improvements in spatial working tasks and the improvements continued throughout the course of the study .
" This not only adds science to the claim that eating blueberries are good for you , it also provides support to a diet - based approach that could potentially be used to increase memory capacity and performance in the future , " said Dr. Matt Whiteman , a principal investigator of the study , which is soon to be published in the science journalBlueberries are a major source of flavonoids , compounds found in fruits , vegetables , and certain beverages that have diverse beneficial biochemical and antioxidant effects .
Flavonoids have been shown to cross the blood / brain barrier when blueberries are consumed .
The enhancement of both short - term and long - term memory is controlled in neurons ( brain cells ) at the molecular level .
The researchers think flavonoids found in blueberries may help learning and memory by enhancing existing neuronal connections , improving communication between cells and stimulating the regeneration of neurons .
The scientists were able to pinpoint the ability of flavonoids to activate signaling proteins in a specific area of the hippocampus , the learning and memory - controlling part of the brain .
" Impaired or failing memory as we get older is one of life 's major inconveniences .
Scientists have known of the potential health benefits of diets rich in fresh fruits for a long time .
Our previous work had suggested that flavonoid compounds had some kind of effect on memory , but until now we had not known the potential mechanisms to account for this , " stated Dr. Jeremy Spencer , a lecturer in Molecular Nutrition at the University of Reading , who headed the study .
Dr. Spencer 's research team plans on continuing to investigate the effects of diets rich in flavonoids on individuals suffering from cognitive impairment and Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .
According to the Alzheimer 's Association , as many as 5.2 million people in the United States are living with AD and 10 million baby boomers will develop the memory - robbing disease in their lifetime .
The Association predicts between 11 million and 16 million people will have AD by 2050 .
The direct and indirect costs of Alzheimer 's and other dementias to Medicare , Medicaid and businesses amount to more than $ 148 billion each year .
While no drug therapy has been shown to be an effective long - term treatment for AD , natural substances are offering hope .
In addition to the new findings suggesting blueberries may provide a treatment for memory loss , additional research published last December in thesuggests omega - 3 fatty acids found in fish oil could play an important role in preventing Alzheimer 's disease .
According to a research team at the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) , omega - 3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) increases the production of LR11 , a protein that is found at reduced levels in Alzheimer 's patients .
LR11 is able to destroy the protein that forms the plaques associated with the disease , the researchers explained .

To gas prices , foreclosure rates and the cost of rice , add this rising economic indicator : the number of tips to the police from people hoping to collect reward money .
Calls to the Southwest Florida Crime Stoppers hot line in the first quarter of this year were up 30 percent over last year .
San Antonio had a 44 percent increase .
Cities and towns from Detroit to Omaha to Beaufort County , N.C. , all report increases of 25 percent or more in the first quarter , with tipsters telling operators they need the money for rent , light bills or baby formula .
“ For this year , everyone that ’s called has pretty much been just looking for money , ” said Sgt. Lawrence Beller , who answers Crime Stoppers calls at the Sussex County , N.J. , sheriff ’s office .
“ That ’s as opposed to the last couple of years , where some people were just sick of the crime and wanting to do something about it . ”
As a result , many programs report a substantial increase in Crime Stopper - related arrests and recovered property , as callers turn in neighbors , grandchildren or former boyfriends in exchange for a little cash .
The worst days of the housing slump may lie ahead .
Buyers vanished from the housing market in March , as sales of new homes plummeted to the lowest level since the housing recession of the 1990s , the government said on Thursday .
Builders are now faced with the biggest backlog of unsold homes in more than a quarter century , a sign that home values may continue to drop .
“ People are obviously reluctant to buy so long as prices continue to fall , ” said Bernard Baumohl , managing director of the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton , N.J. “ They have no desire to buy a house that is going to be worth less two months later . ”
Even those who wish to buy may be stymied , Mr. Baumohl said , as banks and mortgage lenders tighten their credit standards amid broader troubles in the economy .
America 's disregard for Canberra 's pleas about Mr Habib came despite the fact that Australian troops were fighting alongside the US in Afghanistan at the time , and preparing to help the US in the invasion of Iraq .
Mr O'Sullivan said Australian officials in Pakistan formed the view on October 22 , 2001 , that Mr Habib might be " rendered " — transferred to a third country for interrogation — and conveyed concerns to Canberra .
A meeting in Canberra the next day — attended by then ASIO director - general Denis Richardson and senior representatives of the Federal Police and three government departments — decided that Australia would oppose his rendition .
He said Mr Richardson conveyed Australia 's position to the US State Department and the US intelligence community .
" The former director - general made plain on a number of occasions to the American authorities the Australian Government 's position .
And that was in October of 2001 , that was in November 2001 and subsequently . "
Mr O'Sullivan 's evidence suggests the US practice of rendition and its use of torture was known at senior levels of the Australian Government three weeks after the invasion of Afghanistan on October 7 .
He told the hearing he believed this was why Australia opposed Mr Habib 's rendition .
" My assumption is that it was because of long - standing Australian policy going back over decades that Australia does not support torture and so we would not support a position where one of our citizens was put in such a position , " Mr O'Sullivan said .
Mr O'Sullivan confirmed the outcome of the officials ' meeting was communicated through senior levels of government on a " need - to - know " basis .
" Such intelligence material would routinely be distributed to the prime minister 's office — to whomever the staffer in the prime minister 's office who is charged with handling such material , " he said .
Mr O'Sullivan said ASIO interviewed Mr Habib in Pakistan on October 24 , 26 , and 29 before he was sent to Egypt without Australia 's consent .
For months after Mr Habib 's rendition , Australia was unable to confirm from either the Egyptians or the Americans where he was .
Mr O'Sullivan said that by November 2001 , ASIO thought it was likely Mr Habib was in Egypt .
By February 2002 , it was almost certain he was held there .
Mr Habib was transferred to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in May 2002 , and held there for almost three years before being released without charge in early 2005 .
He said later that his interrogators in Egypt had beaten his feet and used an electric cattle prod to torture him .
He said he also saw a man beaten to death in front of him and was warned the same could happen to him .
Last night , an angry Mr Habib told The Age he did not believe Mr O'Sullivan 's version of events .
He said he was convinced Australian authorities supported the US plan to render him to Cairo .
" What did they do to stop it ? " Mr Habib said .
" I know Australia had a hand in my rendition to Egypt . "
Mr Habib said that in Egypt he was interrogated by a man he knew to be an agent contracted to an Australian intelligence agency .
He knew the names of Australian agents operating from the Australian embassy in Cairo but he would be breaking the law if he made that information public .
Mr Habib said the Howard government only asked for him to be moved when the media found out where he was .
Greens senator Kerry Nettle said yesterday 's hearing revealed that three other agencies at the October 23 meeting — the Federal Police , the Attorney - General 's Department and the Prime Minister 's Department — did nothing to stop Mr Habib 's rendition .
" It 's damning .
If you do n't actively ensure that it does n't happen , then you are ensuring that it does , " she told The Age .

James Rajotte , the Alberta Conservative MP and Chair of the Standing Committee on Industry delivered a noteworthy address at the Public Policy Forum event on copyright this afternoon .
Rajotte divided the government 's IP agenda into three parts .
The first involves commercialization of scientific research , which his committee is currently studying ( Rajotte encouraged participants to feed into that process ) .
The second is the need to address commercial counterfeiting concerns through greater enforcement resources and potentially legislative change .
The third is copyright reform .
Rajotte indicated that the current plan is to introduce a copyright bill before the House of Commons breaks for the summer – ie .
within the next six weeks .
Rajotte assured the audience that the government is working toward a balanced approach in the forthcoming bill .
He made particular mention of the need to distinguish between commercial infringement ( bad ) and non-commercial cases of infringement such as time shifting and format shifting ( not so bad ) .
He also focused on the desire for robust hearings on the bill , with the need for a committee ( possibly his ) to conduct hearings once the bill is introduced .
" Gnomish helms should not function .

We have seen that knowledge implies mutual information between a mind and its environment , and we have seen that this mutual information is negentropy in a very physical sense :
If you know where molecules are and how fast they 're moving , you can turn heat into work via a Maxwell 's Demon / Szilard engine .
We have seen that forming true beliefs without evidence is the same sort of improbability as a hot glass of water spontaneously reorganizing into ice cubes and electricity .
Rationality takes " work " in a thermodynamic sense , not just the sense of mental effort ; minds have to radiate heat if they are not perfectly efficient .
This cognitive work is governed by probability theory , of which thermodynamics is a special case .
( Statistical mechanics is a special case of statistics . )
If you saw a machine continually spinning a wheel , apparently without being plugged into a wall outlet or any other source of power , then you would look for a hidden battery , or a nearby broadcast power source - something to explain the work being done , without violating the laws of physics .
So if a mind is arriving at true beliefs , and we assume that the second law of thermodynamics has not been violated , that mind must be doing something at least vaguely Bayesian - at least one process with a sort - of Bayesian structure somewhere - or it could n't possibly work .
In the beginning , at time T=0 , a mind has no mutual information with a subsystem S in its environment .
At time T=1 , the mind has 10 bits of mutual information with S. Somewhere in between , the mind must have encountered evidence - under the Bayesian definition of evidence , because all Bayesian evidence is mutual information and all mutual information is Bayesian evidence , they are just different ways of looking at it - and processed at least some of that evidence , however inefficiently , in the right direction according to Bayes on at least some occasions .
The mind must have moved in harmony with the Bayes at least a little , somewhere along the line - either that or violated the second law of thermodynamics by creating mutual information from nothingness .
In fact , any part of a cognitive process that contributes usefully to truth - finding must have at least a little Bayesian structure - must harmonize with Bayes , at some point or another - must partially conform with the Bayesian flow , however noisily - despite however many disguising bells and whistles - even if this Bayesian structure is only apparent in the context of surrounding processes .
Or it could n't even help .
How philosophers pondered the nature of words !
All the ink spent on the true definitions of words , and the true meaning of definitions , and the true meaning of meaning !
What collections of gears and wheels they built , in their explanations !
And all along , it was a disguised form of Bayesian inference !
I was actually a bit disappointed that no one in the audience jumped up and said : " Yes !
Yes , that 's it !
Of course !
It was really Bayes all along ! "
But perhaps it is not quite as exciting to see something that does n't look Bayesian on the surface , revealed as Bayes wearing a clever disguise , if : ( a ) you do n't unravel the mystery yourself , but read about someone else doing it ( Newton had more fun than most students taking calculus ) , and ( b ) you do n't realize that searching for the hidden Bayes - structure is this huge , difficult , omnipresent quest , like searching for the Holy Grail .
It 's a different quest for each facet of cognition , but the Grail always turns out to be the same .
It has to be the right Grail , though - and the entire Grail , without any parts missing - and so each time you have to go on the quest looking for a full answer whatever form it may take , rather than trying to artificially construct vaguely hand - waving Grailish arguments .
Then you always find the same Holy Grail at the end .
It was previously pointed out to me that I might be losing some of my readers with the long essays , because I had n't " made it clear where I was going " ...
... but it 's not so easy to just tell people where you 're going , when you 're going somewhere like that .
It 's not very helpful to merely know that a form of cognition is Bayesian , if you do n't know how it is Bayesian .
If you can't see the detailed flow of probability , you have nothing but a password - or , a bit more charitably , a hint at the form an answer would take ; but certainly not an answer .
That 's why there 's a Grand Quest for the Hidden Bayes - Structure , rather than being done when you say " Bayes ! "
Bayes - structure can be buried under all kinds of disguies , hidden behind thickets of wheels and gears , obscured by bells and whistles .
The way you begin to grasp the Quest for the Holy Bayes is that you learn about cognitive phenomenon XYZ , which seems really useful - and there 's this bunch of philosophers who 've been arguing about its true nature for centuries , and they are still arguing - and there 's a bunch of AI scientists trying to make a computer do it , but they can't agree on the philosophy either -
And -
Huh , that 's odd !
- this cognitive phenomenon did n't look anything like Bayesian on the surface , but there 's this non-obvious underlying structure that has a Bayesian interpretation - but wait , there 's still some useful work getting done that can't be explained in Bayesian terms - no wait , that 's Bayesian too - OH MY GOD this completely different cognitive process , that also did n't look Bayesian on the surface , ALSO HAS BAYESIAN STRUCTURE - hold on , are these non-Bayesian parts even doing anything ?
Yes : Wow , those are Bayesian too !
No : Dear heavens , what a stupid design .
I could eat a bucket of amino acids and puke a better brain architecture than that .
Once this happens to you a few times , you kinda pick up the rhythm .
That 's what I 'm talking about here , the rhythm .
Trying to talk about the rhythm is like trying to dance about architecture .
This left me in a bit of a pickle when it came to trying to explain in advance where I was going .
I know from experience that if I say , " Bayes is the secret of the universe , " some people may say " Yes !
Bayes is the secret of the universe ! " ; and others will snort and say , " How narrow - minded you are ; look at all these other ad - hoc but amazingly useful methods , like regularized linear regression , that I have in my toolbox . "
I hoped that with a specific example in hand of " something that does n't look all that Bayesian on the surface , but turns out to be Bayesian after all " - and an explanation of the difference between passwords and knowledge - and an explanation of the difference between tools and laws - maybe then I could convey such of the rhythm as can be understood without personally going on the quest .
Of course this is not the full Secret of the Bayesian Conspiracy , but it's all that I can convey at this point .
Besides , the complete secret is known only to the Bayes Council , and if I told you , I 'd have to hire you .
To see through the surface adhockery of a cognitive process , to the Bayesian structure underneath - to perceive the probability flows , and know how , not just know that , this cognition too is Bayesian - as it always is - as it always must be - to be able to sense the Force underlying all cognition - this , is the Bayes - Sight .

Light Beam with a Curve
A light beam appears to bend and propagate without spreading .
Phys . Rev. Lett. 99 , 213901 ( 2007 )
Phys . Rev. Lett. 99 , 213901 ( 2007 ) ×
A new optics experiment makes a light beam appear to bend in air .
The brightest patch of the beam also appears to travel with almost no spreading , unlike ordinary laser beams , as a team reports in the 23 November Physical Review Letters .
The so - called Airy beam may lead to new kinds of optical engineering .
Any ordinary beam of light spreads as it travels , thanks to the wave effect known as diffraction .
Even a laser pointer ’s beam gets wider and dimmer on the way to a distant screen .
But in 1987 a team introduced the Bessel beam , whose intensity remains constant as you move away from the source [ 1 ] .
The “ trick ” is that light does n’t actually travel along the beam axis ; the intensity at any location in the beam results from the complicated interference of light emerging from all points in a large , ring - shaped slit at the source .
Other researchers have devised variations on the Bessel beam that have other surprising properties .
Now Demetri Christodoulides , Aristide Dogariu , and their colleagues at the University of Central Florida in Orlando have come up with a new family of non-diffracting waveforms that have another , even stranger property : they appear to curve .
The Airy waveform was described theoretically nearly 30 years ago as a surprising solution to the quantum equation for a free particle , a problem with a mathematical analogy in optics [ 2 ] .

Phys . Rev. Lett. 99 , 213901 ( 2007 ) Impossible light .
The Airy beam–now created in the lab–bends sideways by about 1 milimeter over the 35 - centimeter section shown in this computer simulation ( top , horizontal axis exaggerated ) .
The two - dimensional version is shown with the beam facing us ( bottom ) . ×
The beam is asymmetric , with one bright region at the center and a series of progressively dimmer patches on one side of the central spot .
But rather than propagating in a straight line , the entire pattern of bright and dark patches curves toward one side .
At the same time , the width and intensity of each patch remains essentially constant , even after an ordinary beam would have dropped to nearly half its original intensity and spread to several times its original width .
The repeated dim patches of an ideal Airy beam extend sideways to infinity , but Christodoulides and his colleagues recently realized that they could approximate it fairly well using an ordinary laser [ 3 ] .
The bell - shaped beam profile happens to correspond well mathematically with a “ truncated ” Airy wave .
To make the beam , the researchers directed a centimeter - wide laser beam onto a watch - sized liquid crystal display screen called a spatial light modulator ( SLM ) .
The reflectivity of each pixel on this screen is related to its index of refraction , so the device allows control of the precise phase of light reflected from each spot .
The team programmed the SLM pixels to provide the phase relationships needed for an Airy beam .
Their measurements of the beam ’s profile at several locations agreed with theoretical predictions , including the beam ’s bending and lack of spreading .
Next the team reprogrammed the SLM to generate a two - dimensional Airy beam–one with secondary spots both below and to the left of the main spot .
It curved up and to the right .
As with the Bessel beam ’s diffraction - free “ propagation , ” light does n’t actually propagate along the curved path .
The beam is the pattern created by interference of light from the 500,000 carefully - phased pixels of the SLM .
Still , Mordechai Segev of the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa is impressed .
“ It ’s a beautiful piece of work , ” he says .
Segev envisions using similar phasing tricks in situations where multiple light beams are needed to create a specific light effect at a precise distance from the source .
“ If you engineer the phase the right way , you will only have white light where the pulses meet .
Imagine if you did something like that in the atmosphere , ” where Airy - like beams could improve LIDAR , a type of laser - based radar used to study the atmosphere .

Solar power is a truly efficient source of energy , but it tends to fluctuate , and , as you might know , it turns off at night .
One clever way to alleviate this intermittence is to store solar energy in the form of heat using molten salt .
An aerospace company , Hamilton Sundstra , has created a venture called SolarReserve , and it plans to have its first molten salt solar power plant online by 2010 .
( This picture is from eSolar , the solar thermal company Google is partnering with for its “ RE Less Than C ” program , but uses a similar setup as SolarReserve ’s proposed plant design , with a central collection tower surrounded by heliostats . )
" The molten salt holds its heat very efficiently and for long periods of time , " Dan Coulom a spokesman at Hamilton Sundstrand .
Coulum said the company plans to build as many as 10 plants over the next 10 to 15 years , pulling in revenues of $ 1 billion over that time period .
With concentrated solar , a large number of motor - controlled mirrors track the sun and reflect the solar energy onto a tower receiver , which in turn heats a liquid that can be used to make steam .
A steam turbine can then produce electricity .
" The molten salt , which is in a storage tank at the bottom of the tower , is run up through the receiver and heated to about 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit , " said Coulom .
The company said using molten salt , a mixture of sodium and potassium nitrate , instead of water or oil , allows the heat to be stored for use on cloudy days or at night .

Al - Qaeda regularly posts audio and video tapes on the internet
Al - Qaeda 's deputy leader , Ayman al - Zawahiri , has blamed Iran for spreading the theory that Israel was behind the 11 September 2001 attacks .
In an audio tape posted on the internet , Zawahiri insisted al - Qaeda had carried out the attacks on the US .
He accused Iran , and its Hezbollah allies , of trying to discredit Osama Bin Laden 's network .
Correspondents say the comments underline al - Qaeda 's increasing public hostility towards Iran .
In a two - hour audiotape posted on an Islamist website , Osama Bin Laden 's chief deputy responded to questions posted by al - Qaeda sympathisers .
In response to a question about persistent rumours in the Middle East that Israel was involved in the 9/11 attacks , Zawahiri said the rumour had begun on the Hezbollah television station , Al - Manar .
" The purpose of this lie is clear - [ to suggest ] that there are no heroes among the Sunnis who can hurt America as no- one else did in history , he said .
" Iranian media snapped up this lie and repeated it . "
Sunni fears
Zawahiri went on to criticise Iran for co-operating with the US in its 2001 invasion of Afghanistan , that helped to oust the Taleban .
" Iran 's aim here is also clear - to cover up its involvement with America in invading the homes of Muslims in Afghanistan and Iraq , " he said .
This is the second verbal attack on Iran , a predominantly Shia Muslim country .
Earlier this month , in an audiotape marking the fifth anniversary of the fall of Iraq 's leader Saddam Hussein , the al - Qaeda deputy accused Iran of planning to annexe southern Iraq and the eastern part of the Arabian peninsula .
BBC security correspondent Rob Watson says such messages appear designed to play on Sunni fears throughout the region of growing Iranian influence , and to present al - Qaeda as the best bulwark against Tehran .
( CNN ) --
The Wisconsin man accused of poisoning his wife with antifreeze and convicted of murdering her was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison with no chance of parole .
Mark Jensen 's chin quivers as a letter from his sons is read in court Wednesday before his sentencing .
Mark Jensen , 48 , was found guilty Thursday in Elkhorn , Wisconsin , of killing his wife , Julie Jensen , in 1998 .
The prosecution said the murder culminated years of torment .
" Your crime is so enormous , so monstrous , so unspeakably cruel that it overcomes all other considerations , " Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder said before pronouncing the sentence .
Watch the judge lower the boom »
Prosecutors contended that Jensen poisoned his 40 - year - old wife with antifreeze and then suffocated her in 1998 , but the defense argued that Julie Jensen was a depressed woman who killed herself and framed her husband .
Julie Jensen had given a neighbor a letter pointing an accusing finger at her husband should anything happen to her .
She also made foreboding comments to police and to her son's teacher , saying she suspected her husband was trying to kill her .
Her letter , read aloud in court , said in part : " I pray I 'm wrong + nothing happens ... but I am suspicious of Mark 's suspicious behaviors + fear for my early demise . "
Read the letter »
The case turned on the admissibility of the letter , which would have been considered unusable " hearsay " evidence if Schroeder had not ruled that it was a " dying declaration . "
In such cases , the defendant has no opportunity to face his accuser .
After the verdict , jurors told reporters that the letter gave them " a clear road map " to conviction , as one female juror phrased it .
Another female juror said he believed Mark Jensen was trying to push his wife over the edge .
" He tortured Julie hoping she could be classically diagnosed as a nutcase , " she said .
Several of the jurors were in the court gallery for the sentencing hearing Wednesday .
Jensen , dressed in blue jail fatigues , sat stoically while Julie Jensen 's four brothers asked for the harshest possible sentence .
" I hope the court shows the same mercy and compassion that the defendant showed our sister , " Patrick Griffin , the victim 's youngest brother , said .
Watch brothers demand justice »
But Jensen 's chin quivered and his eyes watered when his attorney read a letter from Jensen 's two sons , David and Douglas .
" He never failed to support us throughout this ordeal , " the sons wrote in requesting mercy for their father . " ...
If anyone in this world is the epitome of loyalty , it is our dad . "

Sadr says US will always be enemy
Moqtada
Sadr lost a key aide on Friday , shot dead in Najaf Radical Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr has said the US will always be his enemy " till the last drop of blood " .
Mr Sadr was responding to a statement by US Defence Secretary Robert Gates , who said that all those within the political process were not enemies .
" I have no enemy but you .
You are the occupier , " Mr Sadr 's statement said .
Iraqi forces have been clashing with militias such as Mr Sadr 's Medhi Army since last month .
The US said 13 gunmen were killed in Baghdad on Saturday .
The latest fighting was in Baghdad 's eastern Sadr City suburb , a stronghold of supporters of Moqtada Sadr .
On Friday , Riyad al - Nuri , a relative and key aide of the cleric , was killed by gunmen in the city of Najaf Which political process do you want to involve me in when you are occupying my land ?
Moqtada Sadr
The cleric blamed the US " occupation " for Mr Nuri 's death .
In his statement on Saturday , Moqtada Sadr said : " I heard the statement of the terrorist American defence minister and I feel compelled to give a decent response to such a terrorist .
I have no enemy but you .
You are the occupier . "
At the Pentagon on Friday , Mr Gates referred to Mr Sadr as a " a significant political figure " .
Mr Sadr called a ceasefire with US - led forces in August last year , which Washington has cited as a key contributing factor to lower levels of violence .
" Those who are prepared to work within the political process in Iraq , and peacefully , are not enemies of the United States , " Mr Gates said .
Iraqi forces launched an offensive in Sadr City a week ago " [ Mr Sadr ] has a large following .
And I think it 's important that he become a part of the process if he is n't already . "
But Mr Sadr asked : " Which political process do you want to involve me in when you are occupying my land ? "
He said he would continue resisting the US presence in a " way that we consider suitable " .
He urged the Iraqi government to " rid the land of the occupier " but said his followers should not " raise your weapons against Iraqis as long as they do n't help the occupier " .
Saturday 's fighting in Sadr City was some of the worst there since Iraqi forces launched an offensive a week ago , residents said .
US forces used both tanks and air support .
In Najaf , a curfew remained in place after the murder Mr Nuri .
Hundreds of people have died in clashes between Iraqi forces and militias , mainly in Baghdad and in Basra in the south , since Prime Minister Nouri Maliki ordered his crackdown on armed gangs .

Probably some DORK like COLORADO .
In November 2006 , the Federal Trade Commission held a huge conference on the challenges that American consumers would face in the next " Tech - Ade . "
The groan - inducing title aside , the event was a chance for the Commission staff to hear from assorted technology experts about the key issues that the FTC would have to police over the next ten years .
Now , a year and a half after the conference , the Commission has finally written up ( PDF ) the " major trends identified at the hearings . "
They are old news by now ( social networking is hot ! ) , but the document does give us some insight into FTC priorities ; hopefully , the Commission can deliver on its goals of ensuring consumer data privacy , monitoring behavioral advertising , and working globally to combat spam and spyware .
" Flogging " online
One of the main trends identified in the report is the shift from consumer to consumer / producer .
Blogs and user - generated content sites continue to blur the line between the consumers and the producers of content .
The FTC notes that it can be difficult for Internet surfers to know if an " amateur " site is really an authentic outlet for someone 's personal opinion .
Pay - per -post schemes are already targeting bloggers , and the Commission has had to issue guidance on this sort of marketing that strongly suggests it must be disclosed .
Fake blogs ( flogs ) , like the ones set up by Sony to promote the PSP , also try to gain authenticity by masquerading as homegrown labors of love .
And while most established media sites have policies designed to keep editorial and advertising separate , blogs may have no such rules in place .
For the FTC , this explosion of media outlets " will make the task of monitoring advertising all the more difficult . "
But for consumers , it will also grow more difficult to separate out authenticity from PR .
At least the Commission is aware of the issues in this area , though whether the FTC's " substantial consumer education efforts " will clear up online confusion remains to be seen .
Global spam smackdown
The FTC report also noted the global nature of threats faced by Internet users , something that has hampered the Commission 's ability to crack down on things like spam and spyware .
Spyware , for instance , is often distributed using " a complex system of affiliates and sub-affiliates to distribute their products to consumers , with each entity in the distribution chain receiving a financial benefit . "
Spam , too , has long been an international phenomenon that makes any one country 's efforts to stop it ineffective .
To take on these problems , the Commission is using powers given to it in the 2006 US SAFE WEB Act ( a ridiculously titled " acronym " bill that stands for Undertaking Spam , Spyware , and Fraud Enforcement with Enforcers Beyond Borders Act ) .
The FTC now partners with 19 consumer protection agencies from 15 different countries to combat spam , it is a member of the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network , and it has signed Memoranda of Understanding with consumer protection agencies in Australia , Canada , China , the UK , and more .
So , err , how 's that spam crackdown going ?
My inbox says , " not so well . "
Unfortunately , spam , spyware , and other Internet threats come from all parts of the globe , and the FTC has as one of its priorities " outreach to the appropriate enforcement authorities in developing nations . "
Good luck .
DRM :
It better be labelled
Finally , the FTC recognizes that consumers want interoperability , and they therefore tend not to like DRM .
While the FTC does n't see its job as making sure that products are interoperable , it will work to " ensure that consumers are provided sufficient information prior to purchase so that they understand any inherent limitations on the use of the products they buy . "
Case in point : the Sony BMG rootkit fiasco , a case in which the Commission actually did charge the company with deception for not informing consumers that certain CDs contained DRM that limited their usefulness .
While all of these priorities sound good , our main question concerns how effectively they will be translated into action .
While the FTC has in fact shown a willingness to go after spammers , spyware vendors , and companies like Sony BMG , the agency 's efforts do n't appear to have done much to stem the flow of Internet annoyances .
When it comes to dealing with established companies that actually have to respond to government investigations and tend to care about public opinion , the Commission 's work has been more valuable .
But , hey , as long as it continues to run the national Do Not Call list , we 'll be happy .
For astronauts toiling in the close quarters of the International Space Station or on a shuttle to Mars , an ordinary germ would be risky enough .
But a recent experiment published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has shown that a microbe can turn even more dangerous in space than on Earth .
In that study , a bacte­rium particularly nasty for humans — salmonella — was shown to become more virulent after just 83 hours of growing in space .
The experiment on the space shuttle Atlantis was designed to explore how a lack of gravity affects disease - causing microbes in space .
Astronauts aboard the space shuttle grew the salmonella , and back on Earth researchers used it to infect a group of mice .
For comparison , bacteria grown in a laboratory on Earth in normal gravity infected another group of mice .
The mice infected with the space - grown germs had a mortality rate almost three times higher than that of mice given germs grown in normal gravity .
Researchers noticed that while on board the space shuttle , the salmonella encased themselves in a biofilm , a protective coating that is notoriously resistant to anti­biotics .
Several follow - up experiments on space shuttle flights over the next few years will look to see whether other bacteria undergo similar changes in virulence in microgravity .
The pro-war lobby is heading to Washington and the halls of Congress Tuesday , April 8 , when General David Petraeus testifies on the continuing war in Iraq .
The Modesto Bee reports that the Republican front group called Vets for Freedom , " in an extraordinary move suggestive of fairly deep pockets ... will pay all travel , lodging and food expenses " for any recent veteran wanting to lobby with them in DC .
The offer attracted Zak Applequist , a local soldier .
" He 's never been to Washington ; until now , he has n't even been particularly involved in politics .
... ' I heard about it through my mom , ' Applequist said , ' and she heard about it through Fox News . ' "

Bill Clinton has been going after Ryan Lizza 's tough Campaign Journal in the New Yorker , turning it , with a classic tweak , into a symbol of elitism and media bias :
He skewered a recent New Yorker magazine article , which quoted an unnamed Clinton campaign adviser 's joke that the former president would be " leading a caravan of Wal - Mart greeters to the polls " on primary day .
Only in Clinton 's retelling , it was the article 's author , not his wife 's adviser , who was laughing at him .
" You know , there was an article in one of the publications the other day making fun of me for being Hillary 's ambassador to rural America .
' They sent that ol ' boy out there running around these little towns .
What in the world 's he doing ? '
And this guy ended by - he thought he was insulting me - he said , ' Next thing you know , Bill Clinton will be taking Wal - Mart greeters to the polls , ' " he said , prompting squeals of delight from an actual Wal - Mart greeter in the crowd and her friends .
" That 's the kind of thing those people that are n't for us say .
You know , they think we 're dumber 'n we are .
I know , cuz I grew up in a place like this , and I figured out that people are just as smart here as anywhere else .
But they ai n't figured it out yet . "

Back in 2004 , The Onion predicted that Gillette would release a 5 - blade razor in a satire entitled : “ Fuck Everything , We ’re Doing Five Blades ” and it was hilarious .
By James M. Kilts
CEO and President ,
The Gillette Company
February 18 , 2004 | Issue 40*07
Would someone tell me how this happened ?
We were the fucking vanguard of shaving in this country .
The Gillette Mach3 was the razor to own .
Then the other guy came out with a three - blade razor .
Were we scared ?
Hell , no .
Because we hit back with a little thing called the Mach3 Turbo .
That ’s three blades and an aloe strip .
For moisture .
But you know what happened next ?
Shut up , I ’m telling you what happened — the bastards went to four blades .
Now we ’re standing around with our cocks in our hands , selling three blades and a strip .
Moisture or no , suddenly we ’re the chumps .
Well , fuck it .
We ’re going to five blades .
Well , it happened .
It ’s called the Gillette Fusion .
And now , the thing has a battery and vibrates …
Do we really need 5 blades that vibrate ?
Somewhere along the history of men ’s grooming , shaving got adulterated and lost its purity , big time .
Looking at the toys that litter the market these days , it ’s clear that it ’s just a marketing war out there .
So Jae and I did some research , revisited our shaving stash , and went on a journey into the art of wet - shaving : a world full of shaving creams scented with Lavender , shaving brushes made of badger hair and ivory handles from England , safety razors from the early 1900 ’s with blades made in Japan , and methods that looked like more art than anything I ’ve associated with shaving before .
Excessive ? maybe .
We went in to investigate , and this is what we found :
The Classic Double - edged Safety Razor
It may seem like I ’m bashing Gillette , but I only have the utmost reverence for Gillette .
Gillette is the designer of one of the finest razors ever made , the Double - edged “ Heavy Duty ” Safety Razor .
It is considered by many experienced “ wet shavers ” as the standard for double - edged safety razors .
I discovered , with the help of many a wet - shavers ’ advice , that one of these old school safety razors , coupled with the proper shaving cream , will do a much better job at giving you a close shave than those new 5 - 6 bladed monsters .
It also wo n’t cost you a tank of gas to buy replacement cartridges , saving you tons in the long - term .
Although they do n’t make them anymore , a German company named Merkur is continuing the legacy with the same high quality and design .
Search for the Merkur Heavy Duty Safety Razor .
I bought mine at lee ’s razor for $ 35 .
Shaving never felt so solid and elegant .
They go for around $ 25 - 35 , but if you ’re looking for the greatest shave of your life , it ’ll be one of the best investments you make in awhile .
Blades
These classic razors usually do n’t come with blades so you ’re going to have to purchase blades separately .
However , this is where you really save because Fusion replacements cost $ 40 for a pack of 8 – that ’s $ 5 per cartridge - – while double edge replacement blades will only cost you around $.50 cents .
Different blades work for different people , so you ’re going to have to experiment a little .
The best bet is to buy small sample pack of the following brands before you go ahead and invest in 20,000 of one kind .
Here are some of the highest quality blades recommended by experienced wet shavers : Merkur ( Germany ) , Personnas ( Israel – great starter blades ) , Derby ( Turkey ) , and Feather ( Japanese blades that are feared and revered as ninja sharp blades – the company makes surgical equipment ) .
Shaving Brushes
Now this is where shaving takes on another level .
Most men do not own a brush nor do they feel compelled to drop $ 25 - $ 500 on something they can use their hands for .
However , if you ’re even somewhat serious about getting the “ perfect shave , ” the shaving brush is an integral piece .
It not only turns your shaving cream into the perfect lather , but raises the hairs on your face for a much better shave .
Not to mention , it also exfoliates dead skin off your face .
Types of Shaving Brush Hairs
There are a few types of shaving brush hairs , and these types ( including what part of the animal the hair is from ) will determine the quality of the brush , as well as the whether it will cost you $ 5 or $ 500 .
The major types you ’re going to find are 1 .
Badger , 2 . Boar , and 3 .
Synthetic .
The Badger is going to account for your highest quality brushes , followed by the Boar .
For many guys , this is where they might want to cut costs , but opting for the boar hair may result in a harsh brush that falls apart all over your face .
You do n’t want that , so I recommend going with the Badger .
Within the Badger brushes you ’re going to get a few grades .
In general the grades are categorized as “ pure ” ( being the lowest grade ) , “ best , ” “ super , ” and “ silver tip . ”
The “ super ” or “ silver tip “ badger brushes are going to be some of the softest , highest quality brushes you can find , and will have a white color instead of its usual black / brown .
These brushes can go upwards of $ 500 .
Personally , I do n’t see the need / value , but to each their own .
I got my best badger brush at Crabtree & Evelyn .
It ’s one of the best values you ’re going to find for a really high - quality badger brush .
Some other great look - for brands are : Vulfix , Savile Row , and Shavemac .
If the idea of using animal hair rubs you the wrong way , Men-u ’s Premier Shaving Brush is a synthetic brush that is highly recommended by experienced wet shavers .
3 - years in the making , many say the men-u premier surpasses the effectiveness of badger brushes in creating a phenomenal lather .
Shaving Creams
Even if you decide to skip the brush , and even the safety razor , you ’re going to see a huge improvement in your shaves by upgrading your shaving cream .
Look for a glycerin - based shaving cream as it binds well with water .
Throw away that shaving gel as they most likely contain alcohol which closes your pores and drys out your skin .
Here are a few brands I would recommend :
Taylor of Old Bond Street ( $ 13 )
Geo F. Trumper ( $ 15 )
Crabtree & Evelyn Sandalwood Shaving Cream ( $ 15 )
Proraso ( $8 )
Here is another great shaving cream that I would recommend : The Art of Shaving Unscented Shaving Cream Tube
How to Shave w/ a Single Blade :
It took a bit to get used to shaving with a single blade instead of “ 5 plus the precision of 1 . ” I was used to rushing , and worse , pressing down on my skin in order to get a closer shave .
Preparation is Key
“ Ninety percent of shaving is preparation ” – Adam Dishell , of The Shave Beverly Hills
Shave after a hot shower , or at the least , wash your face in hot water for at least 30 seconds .
This will open up your pores and get your hair exposed for the shave .
You can also put a hot towel on your face like when you ’re getting a wet shave at a barber .
You can also go as far as using pre-shave oil to make your whiskers stand , but I find that a little excessive–a good shaving cream will do that for you .
Here ’s a great video of a single blade in action :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO2gMTNnyYk&feature=related]
The Aftermath
So many guys forget to moisturize their skin .
Shaving tends to expose new skin and really dry it out .
Use a good moisturizer to avoid the red and itching that may be the aftermath .
Here are some great after - shave balms :
Nivea Extra Soothing Balm ( $6 )
At $ 6 this is one of the best values when it comes to after shave balms .
Proraso Liquid Cream After Shave ( $ 12 )
The Italians know what they ’re doing when it comes to shaving , and this after shave cream is a prime example .
Art of Shaving After Shave Balm ( $ 38 )
Personally , I think Art of Shaving is overpriced , but their products are quality .
Their shave balm is especially good .
Geo F. Trumper Skin Food
More a luxury than a necessity .
The Verdict :
Now the question is does all this result in a better , closer shave ?
or is it all merely a hyped - up hobby ?
I went out and bought some of the latest and greatest , and began to truly scrutinize my shaves .
At first , the shave was comparable between my old gear ( Gillette fusion , can of gel shaving cream ) and the new ( merkur HD , taylor ’s shaving cream , badger brush ) .
In fact , using the classic safety razor initially resulted in a somewhat lack - luster shave with some nicks and cuts .
However , after a few shaves under my belt , and a few revisions to my strategy , I began getting some of the closest shaves ever .
If anything , the shave brush and shaving cream upgrade alone magnified my shaving experience by ten - fold , even with my old multi- blade razor .
The Merkur just took it to the next level .
Not to mention , the whole process is an addictive , luxurious treat that sets the tone for the entire day .
Try it , and see for yourself .

Do you believe this ?
In early March Colombia invaded Ecuador , killed a guerrilla chief in the jungle , opened his laptop – and what did the Colombians find ?
A message to Hugo Chavez that he sent the FARC guerrillas $ 300 million – which they ’re using to obtain uranium to make a dirty bomb !
That ’s what George Bush tells us .
And he got that from his buddy , the strange right - wing President of Colombia , Alvaro Uribe .
So : After the fact , Colombia justifies its attempt to provoke a border war as a way to stop the threat of WMDs !
Uh , where have we heard that before ?
The US press snorted up this line about Chavez ’ $ 300 million to “ terrorists ” quicker than the young Bush inhaling Colombia ’s powdered export .
What the US press did not do is look at the evidence , the email in the magic laptop .
( Presumably , the FARC leader ’s last words were , “ Listen , my password is – . ” )
I read them .
( You can read them here )
While you can read it all in espanol , here is , in translation , the one and only mention of the alleged $ 300 million from Chavez :
“ With relation to the 300 , which from now on we will call “ dossier , ” efforts are now going forward at the instructions of the boss to the cojo [ slang term for cripple , which I will explain in a separate note .
Let 's call the boss Ãngel , and the cripple Ernesto . ”
Got that ?
Where is Hugo ?
Where ’s 300 million ?
And 300 what ?
Indeed , in context , the note is all about the hostage exchange with the FARC that Chavez was working on at the time ( December 23 , 2007 ) at the request of the Colombian government .
Indeed , the entire remainder of the email is all about the mechanism of the hostage exchange .
Here ’s the next line :
“ To receive the three freed ones , Chavez proposes three options : Plan A .
Do it to via of a humanitarian caravan one that will involve Venezuela , France , the Vatican [ ? ] , Switzerland , European Union , democrats [ civil society ] , Argentina , Red Cross , etc . ”
As to the 300 , I must note that the FARC ’s previous prisoner exchange involved 300 prisoners .
Is that what the 300 refers to ?
¿ Quien sabe ?
Unlike Uribe , Bush and the US press , I wo n’t guess or make up a phastasmogoric story about Chavez mailing checks to the jungle .
To bolster their case , the Colombians claim , with no evidence whatsoever , that the mysterious “ Angel ” is the code name for Chavez .
But in the memo , Chavez goes by the code name Chavez .
Well , so what ?
This is what . . . .
Colombia ’s invasion into Ecuador is a rank violation of international law , condemned by every single Latin member of the Organization of American States .
But George Bush just loved it .
He called Uribe to back Colombia , against , “ the continuing assault by narco - terrorists as well as the provocative maneuvers by the regime in Venezuela . ”
Well , our President may have gotten the facts ass - backward , but Bush knows what he ’s doing : shoring up his last , faltering ally in South America , Uribe , a desperate man in deep political trouble .
Uribe claims he is going to bring charges against Chavez before the International Criminal Court .
If Uribe goes there in person , I suggest he take a toothbrush : it was just discovered that right - wing death squads held murder - planning sessions at Uribe ’s ranch .
Uribe ’s associates have been called before the nation ’s Supreme Court and may face prison .
In other words , it ’s a good time for a desperate Uribe to use that old politico ’s wheeze , the threat of war , to drown out accusations of his own criminality .
Furthermore , Uribe ’s attack literally killed negotiations with FARC by killing FARC ’s negotiator , Raul Reyes .
Reyes was in talks with both Ecuador and Chavez about another prisoner exchange .
Uribe authorized the negotiations .
However , Uribe knew , should those talks have succeeded in obtaining the release of those kidnapped by the FARC , credit would have been heaped on Ecuador and Chavez , and discredit heaped on Uribe .
Luckily for a hemisphere on the verge of flames , the President of Ecuador , Raphael Correa , is one of the most level - headed , thoughtful men I ’ve ever encountered .
Correa is now flying from Quito to Brazilia to Caracas to keep the region from blowing sky high .
While moving troops to his border – no chief of state can permit foreign tanks on their sovereign soil – Correa also refuses sanctuary to the FARC .
Indeed , Ecuador has routed out 47 FARC bases , a better track record than Colombia ’s own , corrupt military .
For his cool , peaceable handling of the crisis , I will forgive Correa for apologizing for his calling Bush , “ a dimwitted President who has done great damage to his country and the world . ”
( Watch an excerpt of my interview with Correa here . )
Amateur Hour in Blue
We can trust Correa to keep the peace South of the Border .
But can we trust our Presidents - to - be ?
The current man in the Oval Office , George Bush , simply can’t help himself : an outlaw invasion by a right - wing death - squad promoter is just fine with him .
But guess who could n’t wait to parrot the Bush line ?
Hillary Clinton , still explaining that her vote to invade Iraq was not a vote to invade Iraq , issued a statement nearly identical to Bush ’s , blessing the invasion of Ecuador as Colombia ’s “ right to defend itself . ”
And she added , “ Hugo ChÃ¡vez must stop these provoking actions . ”
Huh ?
I assumed that Obama would n’t jump on this landmine – especially after he was blasted as a foreign policy amateur for suggesting he would invade across Pakistan ’s border to hunt terrorists .
It 's embarrassing that Barack repeated Hillary ’s line nearly verbatim , announcing , “ the Colombian government has every right to defend itself . ”
( I ’m sure Hillary ’s position was n’t influenced by the loan of a campaign jet to her by Frank Giustra .
Giustra has given over a hundred million dollars to Bill Clinton projects .
Last year , Bill introduced Giustra to Colombia ’s Uribe .
On the spot , Giustra cut a lucrative deal with Uribe for Colombian oil . )
Then there ’s Mr. War Hero .
John McCain weighed in with his own idiocies , announcing that , “ Hugo Chavez is establish[ing ] a dictatorship , ” presumably because , unlike George Bush , Chavez counts all the votes in Venezuelan elections .
****************
Watch Greg Palast ’s reports from Venezuela and Ecuador for BBC Television Newsnight and Democracy Now ! compiled on the DVD , “ The Assassination of Hugo Chavez . ”
The report says that 70 % of the world 's poor are women Women are discriminated against in almost every country around the world , a UN - commissioned report says .
It says that this is despite the fact that 185 UN member states pledged to outlaw laws favouring men by 2005 .
It adds that 70 % of the world 's poor are women and they own just 1 % of the world 's titled land .
The report , which was prepared for UN Human Right Commissioner Louise Arbour , says rape within marriage has still not been made a crime in 53 nations .
' Life - long violation '
The report was compiled by Fareda Banda , a law professor at London 's School of Oriental and African Studies ( SOAS ) .
At a news conference in Geneva , Prof Banda said that other laws discriminating women included statutes on divorce , maternity benefits and pensions .
HAVE YOUR SAY EVERY woman I know has experienced discrimination or abuse J K Holtz , Chicago
She said that even basic laws like the legal ages for marriage could have a huge impact on women 's lives : " Many states still have different ages of marriage for young women than they have for young men , and the age for girls is always lower then the age for boys .
" This leads to violations , for example of a girls ' right education , if she has to leave school at 14 to get married , and this impacts upon her life chances .
" It ends up being a life - long violation of her rights in terms of forfeiting education , having children too early , possibly being damaged herself . "
The report recommends the introduction of a new , separate mechanism to fight discrimination because existing UN and international human rights laws are not being upheld .
It also calls for a new UN expert to focus specifically on laws which damage women 's chances in life .

What are these ?
A person with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 30 or greater is considered obese .
BMI is calculated as weight in pounds divided by height in inches squared and multiplied by 703 .
The lower house of parliament in France has just passed a law to prevent thinness .
My , what a cultural contrast to the Unites States , where two - thirds of all adults are considered overweight or obese and our lawmakers are worried about fatness , not thinness .
Problem is , both cultures do n't really understand the role of culture in how their citizens look .
It starts with biology .
Any culture is made up of a group of people with a shared history and some shared genes .
Today we live in a globally dynamic world where people come and go , but not long ago , humans lived in isolated populations where people tended to look alike simply because they mated with similar looking people .
Maasai men tend to be tall because they tend to make babies with other Maasai who are also tall .
Central African pygmies are short because they make babes with other pygmies .
Selective mating , then , has produced societies where people tend to have similar features and similar body types .
But that 's where genetic influences on body size end , because body weight and shape are also highly influenced by experience , which is sometimes called " culture " or " environment . "
Body size is , within genetic limits , highly flexible , with a wide range of outcomes .
Grow up in an agricultural culture and you 'll probably be thin and hard - muscled because of daily physical exertion .
Live in a culture where rice is the major staple , and you 'll probably be small because you never get enough to eat .
Sit around working on a computer like everyone else in your culture and guess what , no matter how little you eat , the pudge factor kicks in .
We also know how dynamic the effect of culture can be on body shape and size when that culture alters .
Children growing up in war zones are under constant stress which stunts their development .
After World War II , kids in Japan received rations of milk for the first time and they ended up much taller than their parents because of increased calcium and vitamin D in their diet .
The introduction of television and processed food makes a new generation of American kids much fatter .
Body size , then , is a movable feast , and it just keeps on moving .
And so the French concern with making laws that keep skinny girls out of magazines is n't going to do all that much because those models are only a tiny sliver of culture , and not a very powerful influence .
No one has been able been able to prove that young women are deeply affected by seeing ultra - thin models ; in fact , most girls know that magazine adds are computer - altered for perfection , and that the models on the runway are just plain scary .
Obviously , in America , with our load of extra fat , those models have n't had much effect .
It 's easy to imagine groups of plump teen - aged American girls sitting around , eating a pizza , maybe wishing they were thin too , but then taking another bite .
And they certainly do n't need laws on the books to make them eat .

Hero is turning some gamers into actual guitar players .
With more than 14 million units sold in North America since the videogame 's release in 2005 , the incredibly popular franchise is giving an entire generation of potential guitarists just enough of a taste for them to consider experimenting with the real thing .
" I 'd always had an interest in playing guitar , and you kind of get more of an inkling to do it when you 're playing the videogame , " said Louis Grondah , who snapped up an acoustic guitar at Guitar Center and started learning chords after playing Guitar Hero .
Grondah , a fan of Metallica , Pantera and Deftones who is currently in training as a police officer in San Jose , California , said he still plays the game , but now spends more time reading books about guitar .
" It 's difficult – I 'm not going to lie , " he said about learning to play the six - string .
" But it 's really fun . "
The wildfire success of music games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band is causing a subtle revolution in popular music – maybe not on the level of the British Invasion of the '60s , but noticeable nonetheless .
The games are bringing about renewed interest in the guitar , a music - making machine that 's been losing traction lately to turntables and laptops .
Guitar
Hero is like a gateway drug that 's getting a new wave of players hooked on guitar .
" It 's been phenomenal , frankly , to watch millions of people embrace the idea of air guitar , " said Tim Huffman , the CEO of guitar - teaching site iVideosongs .
" And not just guys .
I mean teenage girls and adults .
Every tour bus with a touring band has Guitar Hero in it . "
In an informal poll , readers of Wired.com 's music blog Listening Post agreed that the Guitar Hero phenomenon will cause a resurgence in guitar rock .
Just do n't expect to read too many stories about videogames leading to outbreaks of music - making ( violence makes for better headlines ) .
Aaron Starke , a 20 - year - old gamer from Sugar Land , Texas , was turned on to the guitar about three months ago after a job at Fry 's Electronics got him playing his fair share of Guitar Hero .
" I play expert mode on pretty much everything , " Starke said about his guitar - gaming prowess .
Like Grondah , he found that learning to play a real guitar requires more patience than toying with a plastic , guitar - shaped game controller .
A self - described classic - rock fan , Starke said he first set his sights on learning to play the Guns N' Roses hit " Sweet Child of Mine " on guitar , then began dabbling in keyboards and drums after encountering those instruments in Rock Band .
He said he plans to form a band ( tentative name : Two and a Half Man Quintet ) with four other guys from his LAN gaming group .
Only the prospective keyboardist has significant experience with his instrument outside of Guitar Hero or Rock Band .
The games are bringing a new generation of players to the instrument , said Jeff Schroedl , vice president of Pop & Standard Publications for old - school music book publisher Hal Leonard , which runs GuitarInstructor.com .
" We actually publish songbooks in hard - book form in conjunction with Guitar Hero and Rock Band , " he said .
" They 're the only sanctioned songbooks that work with the game , and those books are flying off the shelves . "
Sales of fretted instruments increased nearly $ 30 million in the last year , said Paul Majeski , publisher of The Music Trades .
" The consumer appeal of the instrument is huge , " Majeski said .
Aaron Starke pulls a rockstar move in Houston , Texas .

Guitar Center , which set up virtual shop in Guitar Hero and has offered deep discounts to gamers who buy real instruments , thinks " interactive videogames such as Guitar Hero and Rock Band are minting more guitar players , " according a representative of the store .
A new crop of online teaching services has appeared to help this wave of new musicians learn guitar in a familiar way : through video .
" [ We ] see a strong future in selling guitar lessons online , partly because of the accessibility of it and the convenience of it , " Schroedl said , " but also because of the visual nature of learning to play music – being able to see a real professional teacher 's fingers on the fretboard and seeing it up close , along with onscreen [ tablature sheets ] . "
There 's even a videogame coming that promises to bridge the gap between game guitar and music lesson : Guitar Rising will purportedly let users play a Guitar Hero - type game using an actual guitar instead of a plastic controller .
Grondah , the metal fan who 's on his way to becoming a cop , said he likes the idea of a game that teaches him something .
" Forget this pushing buttons crap , " he said .
" You 're actually strumming and playing strings ....
That sounds like a cool premise . "

Hey SuperDelegates , having fun yet ?
This is the kind of talk you ’re going to increasingly get if you let Hillary continue this charade in her effort to destroy our party .
We ’ve now got Rush Limbaugh calling for riots in the streets of Denver ( something that should get him investigated by the police , the FBI and the Secret Service , and I also have a suspicion there must be an FCC rule or two about this as well – tell me his stations ca n’t be fined millions for inciting violence – who ’s going to file the complaint ? )
In any case , expect more of the same , the longer the SuperDelegates let this ridiculous farce drag out .
Had they nipped this in the bud weeks ago , we would n’t now be talking about riots in Denver .
It ’s only going to get worse and worse the longer they let this continue .
Cowardice comes with a price .
As gay couples celebrate their newfound right to marry in California and opposition groups rally to fight the ruling , many struggle with this question :
Is homosexuality natural ?
On this issue , Nature has spoken : Same - sex lovin ' is common in hundreds of species , scientists say .
Roy and Silo , two male chinstrap penguins at New York 's Central Park Zoo , were a couple for about six years , during which they nurtured a fertilized egg together ( given to them by a zookeeper ) and raised the young chick that hatched .
According to University of Oslo zoologist Petter Böckman , about 1,500 animal species are known to practice same - sex coupling , including bears , gorillas , flamingos , owls , salmon and many others .
If homosexuality is natural in the animal kingdom , then there is the question of why evolution has n't eliminated this trait from the gene pool , since it does n’t lead to reproduction .
It may simply be for pleasure .
" Not every sexual act has a reproductive function , " said Janet Mann , a biologist at Georgetown University who studies dolphins ( homosexual behavior is very common in these marine mammals ) .
" That 's true of humans and non-humans . "
Some scientists have proposed that being gay may serve its own evolutionary purpose .
" It could be a way that you strengthen bonds — that 's one hypothesis , " Mann told LiveScience .
" Another is that it could be practice for heterosexual sex .
Bottlenose dolphin calves mount each other a lot .
That might benefit them later on . "
Marlene Zuk , a biologist at the University of California , Riverside , suggested that gay individuals contribute to the gene pool of their community by nurturing their relatives ’ young without diverting resources by having their own offspring .
One thing that does seem to be exclusive to humans is homophobia .
" It 's a very interesting question as to why anybody ever cares , " Mann said .
" There are different theories about why people find it threatening .
Some think it disrupts male bonds , like you 're not playing for the right team .
The funny thing is that people say homosexuality is unnatural , that non-humans do n't engage in homosexual behavior , but that 's not true .
Then they 'll say it 's base and animalistic . "
Humans ' resistance to the idea of homosexuality extends even to research on the behavior in animals .
Scientists who study the topic are often accused of trying to forward an agenda , and their work can come under greater scrutiny than that of their colleagues who study other topics , Mann said
" It 's kind of a shame because I think that probably is a reason why people do n't look at it more , " Mann said .
" That 's probably why we have n't gotten further .
You would think we'd know more than we do by now . "
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto died when the force of a bomb blast slammed her head into an escape hatch on her SUV , Scotland Yard said in a report released Friday .
Benazir Bhutto greets her supporters at the rally where she was later killed .
more photos »
She was not shot , the report said .
Investigators concluded that one attacker fired shots and then detonated a powerful suicide bomb as Bhutto stood through the open roof of her SUV , waving to supporters .
The force of the blast , in Rawalpindi on December 27 last year , propelled her head into part of the escape hatch and caused an injury that killed her , Scotland Yard said .
Those findings are consistent with assertions that Pakistani authorities have made since initially suggesting that she died of a gunshot wound or from an injury caused by a bomb fragment .
But a spokeswoman for Bhutto's Pakistan 's People 's Party said the British investigators were limited in their ability to investigate the killing fully and that the party remained convinced that Bhutto died from a gunshot wound .
The Scotland Yard report , by a team assisting Pakistani investigators examining the slaying , acknowledged " speculation that two individuals were directly involved in the attack , " with one firing a gun and another detonating a bomb .
The investigators , however , concluded that only one person was directly involved in the assault that killed the leading opposition figure about two months after she returned to Pakistan after several years of self - imposed exile .
Watch Bhutto's party react to the findings »
" All the available evidence points toward the person who fired the shots and the person who detonated the explosives being one and the same person , " the report says .
The attacker fired gunshots before detonating a bomb at the rear of a vehicle in which Bhutto was traveling , the report added .
" The blast caused a violent collision between her head and the escape hatch area of the vehicle , causing a severe and fatal head injury , " it said .
Bhutto was killed while standing in an moving armored car after rallying supporters for parliamentary elections .
The vote , originally scheduled for early January , was postponed until February 18 in the wake of her death .
Her head was above the sunroof and unprotected at the time of the attack .
The cause of her death was not clear after her death : a bomber blew himself up near Bhutto 's limousine , and videotape showed a gunman apparently firing shots toward her -- but no autopsy was carried out at the family 's request .
Bhutto's family and party have accused Musharraf 's government of having a role in her death , and have criticized the security provided to her by the government .
Musharraf has denied any involvement in her death .
Pakistani investigators examining Bhutto's slaying are being assisted by a small team from Scotland Yard .
On Friday , authorities in Pakistan said four people were in custody in connection with Bhutto 's assassination , though they declined to elaborate .
Sherry Rehman , a spokeswoman for Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party , told CNN less than an hour after the report 's release that she and other Bhutto supporters remained skeptical of the cited cause of death .
" We find it difficult to agree with the finding by Scotland Yard that she died from the impact of the blast , " she said .
Yet she said the party wanted to look beyond the hand that pulled the trigger to focus on who organized and paid for the killing .
" This gives us all the more reason to look ... to who perpetrated the crime who financed and organized this brutal assassination , " she said .
" This will give us all the more impetus to ask for a larger U.N. international probe . "
Pakistan 's government has concluded that Bhutto's assassination was orchestrated by Baitullah Mehsud , the leader of the Pakistani Taliban who has ties to al Qaeda -- a conclusion that the CIA came to as well .

College students have always had the dubious distinction of being easy marks in the target against P2P file sharing .
As of February 2007 , the RIAA has dispatched thirteen new waves of litigation letters against U.S. University students in their ' deterrence ' campaign aimed at more than 5,000 students .
But one University is fighting back - albeit very quietly - and that 's Purdue .
Notoriously known for their aggressive pro-piracy stance and prolific file sharing , Purdue has never been one to fly under the RIAA radar .
Perched at # 2 on the all - time piracy “ badass ” list , they ’re no strangers to RIAA ’s threats , and students are continuously under attack in these personal litigation “ waves ” .
The RIAA threats are in large part due to the uncooperativeness of their Internet provider to assist in RIAA ’s ‘ nip it in the bud ’ approach to thwarting music piracy at the school level .
Not to be intimidated , however , Purdue has fired up their own P2P file - sharing “ intranet ” from behind the walls of their campus ISP .
Dubbed ‘ Dtella ‘ ( from DC + Gnutella ) .
A Purdue student wrote on the CollegeOTR.com blog : “ Maybe Purdue ca n’t beat other schools ’ music scenes , frat - house parties , hot girls , and what not , but at least we ’ve got them beat in the piracy department .
After all , we are the # 2 school in music piracy as noted by the RIAA . ”
The filesharing network accomplishes two things :
1 . It alleviates ‘ bandwidth capping ’ commonly imposed on all traffic that leaves the University ’s intranet .
When a file sharing program is self - contained within the ISP itself , there are usually no limitations to how much data can be transferred , and users are free to share huge amounts of files at high speeds .
Currently , Purdue uses Resnet as their ISP which limits the daily traffic to a modest 5GB .
2 . Even more important , it keeps the P2P traffic off the Internet , which in turn is advantageous for keeping file transfers out of the prying eyes of the RIAA or other anti-piracy organizations .
There ’s nothing new about campuses using their “ intranet ” to share files , although it is relatively uncommon for one to take it a step further by setting up their own secure P2P network .
This is simply a response to the RIAA threats and the countless ruined lives through pointless RIAA litigation .
Open outcry trading is being replaced by electronic methods
A single trader bid up the price by buying a modest lot and then sold it immediately at a loss , they claim .
The New York Mercantile Exchange said that US crude oil futures traded just once in triple figures on Wednesday .
Some analysts questioned the validity of the trade , though their concerns faded as oil set a record on Thursday .
New York light sweet crude climbed to a new high of $ 100.05 a barrel on Thursday .
Vanity trade
On Wednesday , one floor trader bought 1,000 barrels , the smallest amount permitted , and sold it immediately for $ 99.40 at a $ 600 loss , said Stephen Schork , a former floor trader on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( Nymex ) and the editor of an oil market newsletter .
" They absolutely overpaid , " he told Radio Four 's Today Programme .
" He paid $ 600 for the right to tell his grandchildren that he was the first in the world to buy $ 100 oil . "
Most trading in energy futures has shifted away from the trading floor and takes place on electronic platforms .
The Nymex , along with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is one of the last bastions of " open outcry " , where traders use frantic hand signals to trade securities .
In London , open outcry trading still takes place on the London Metal Exchange , where aluminium , copper and zinc are traded .
Electronic trading has replaced open outcry in most financial markets because it is seen as being faster and more efficient .
Supporters also claim that it is harder to manipulate the market when trades are executed electronically .
The dwindling liquidity on the Nymex trading floor has led to considerable speculation that the exchange will soon shut down the trading floor to cut costs .
A new wine made from certified organic Malbec grapes will soon be available in the United States .
But instead of a bottle , the wine will use lightweight packaging known as TetraPak , traditionally associated with juice boxes , in the name of lowering its carbon footprint .
Matthew Cain , regional sales director for fine wine importer Kermit Lynch for nine years , will be importing the wine through his new company , J. Soif .
“ Over a period of time I came to the realization that the wine business just does n’t work , ” he told me in a telephone interview last week .
“ Eighty percent of wine is drunk within a week .
It does n’t make sense to put nine liters of wine in a 40 pound box and ship it thousands of miles . ”
So Cain , 38 , looked to TetraPak .
In other countries , he noted , “ people are using alternative packaging to bring down the cost of wine .
It ’s not just for poor wine but for good wine .
Here in the US , it ’s only been used as a gimmick . ”
He added about his wine , “ I ’ve been in the fine wine trade my entire life and I have no interest in bad wine . ”
Explaining his motivation , Cain said that he has seen wine prices go up , transportation prices go up , and that made him want to “ bring a great wine to the market at a reasonable price . ”
His interest in environmental issues and research on this site about wine ’s carbon footprint pushed him to make a sustainable wine from beginning to end .
Used his contacts in the fine wine business , he went to Argentina to find a producer growing certified organic grapes .
The grapes were destined for bottled wine , not bulk wine , but Cain bought them .
Instead of bottling the wine in Mendoza , he put them in a 24,000 liter flexitank .
The wine was trucked over the Andes , loaded onto a ship on the Chilean coast , then shipped through the Panama canal and up to Montreal below deck in an insulated container ( but not refrigerated ) .
There it was trucked to Toronto where the TetraPak packaging material was waiting .
Click on the map to the right to see the route .
The facility in Toronto is also certified organic .
The wine is put in the one liter boxes that weigh 40 grams each ( compared to 500 – 750g for a bottle ) and loaded onto a truck for a warehouse in New Jersey .
The total amount of wine will be about 10,000 nine - liter cases .
Using my carbon calculator , I ran the numbers on this wine , called “ Yellow + Blue ” ( makes green–get it ? ) .
I figure that each 750 ml of Yellow +
Blue Malbec has about half the greenhouse gas emissions of a conventional bottle of wine from Argentina that followed the same route .
The price will follow a similar discount : Yellow +
Blue will sell for $ 10.99 in stores and Cain suggests that the same wine in bottle would sell for about $ 20 .
But Yellow +
Blue , weighing in at one liter , holds a third more wine than a regular bottle .
I look forward to trying it .

Imagine , a candidate for president who , a year or so ago , no one would have considered electable .
Now the person is the front - runner , with a groundswell of grass - roots support , threatening the sense of inevitability of the Establishment candidates .
No , I ’m not talking about the U.S. presidential race , but the race for president of the largest association of psychologists in the world , the American Psychological Association ( APA ) .
At the heart of the election is a raging debate over torture and interrogations .
While the other healing professions , including the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association , bar their members from participating in interrogations , the APA leadership has fought against such a restriction .
Frustrated with the APA , a New York psychoanalyst , Dr. Steven Reisner , has thrown his hat into the ring .
Last year , Reisner and other dissident psychologists formed the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology in an attempt to force a moratorium against participation by APA members in harsh interrogations .
During the initial phase of this year ’s selection process , Reisner received the most nominating votes .
He is running on a platform opposing the use of psychologists to oversee abusive and coercive interrogations of prisoners at Guantanamo , secret CIA black sites or anywhere else international law or the Geneva Conventions are said not to apply .
The issue came to a head at the 2007 APA annual convention .
After days of late - night negotiations , the moratorium came up for a climactic vote .
We saw a surreal scene on the convention floor : Uniformed military were out in force .
Men and women in desert camo and Navy whites worked the APA Council of Representatives , and officers in crisp dress uniforms stepped to the microphones .
Military psychologists insisted that they help make interrogations safe , ethical and legal , and cited instances where psychologists allegedly intervened to stop abuse .
“ If we remove psychologists from these facilities , people are going to die ! ” boomed Col. Larry James of the U.S. Army , chief psychologist at Guantanamo Bay and a member of the APA governing body .
Dr. Laurie Wagner , a Dallas psychologist , shot back , “ If psychologists have to be there in order to keep detainees from being killed , then those conditions are so horrendous that the only moral and ethical thing to do is to protest by leaving . ”
The moratorium failed , and instead a watered - down resolution passed , outlining 19 harsh interrogation techniques that were banned , but only if “ used in a manner that represents significant pain or suffering or in a manner that a reasonable person would judge to cause lasting harm . ”
In other words , this loophole allowed , you can rough people up , just do n’t do permanent harm .
Immediately after the vote , Reisner spoke out at a packed town hall meeting : “ If we can not say , ‘ No , we will not participate in enhanced interrogations at CIA black sites , ’ I think we have to seriously question what we are as an organization and , for me , what my allegiance is to this organization , or whether we might have to criticize it from outside the organization at this point . ”
Reisner and others began withholding dues .
Prominent APA members resigned , and the best - selling author of “ Reviving Ophelia , ” Mary Pipher , returned her APA Presidential Citation award .
After several months of bad publicity and internal negotiations , an emergency committee redrafted that resolution , removing the loopholes and affirming the outright prohibition of 19 techniques , like mock executions and waterboarding .
When I asked Dr. Reisner , the son of Holocaust survivors , why he would want to head the organization that he has battled for several years , he told me : “ If I have this opportunity to make a change , I have a responsibility to do it .
I never had the intention of being involved , but the only way to ensure this be changed was by claiming the democratic process in the name of human rights and social - justice issues .
I was hoping that mass withholding of dues and mass resignations would shame the APA to come to its senses .
It made them take a big step but did n’t go far enough . ”
He expanded : “ American people are sick of the reputation of the United States as torturers , as people who abuse prisoners .
American people want to see a restoration of values from war to health care .
I think what happens in the APA should point to a direction for the whole country . ”
The APA ’s annual meeting is this summer , in Boston .
Expect interrogation to be the major issue confronting the members gathered there .
Final voting for the APA president starts in October .
The APA and the United States will determine their next presidents at about the same time .
In both elections , a thorough debate on torture should be central .

The Fed ’s efforts these past nine months remind me of the old TV series “ MacGyver , ” whose ingenious hero would always get out of difficult situations by assembling clever devices out of household objects and duct tape .

Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
Because the institutions in trouble were n’t called banks , the Fed ’s usual tools for dealing with financial trouble , designed for a system centered on traditional banks , were largely useless .
So the Fed has cobbled together makeshift arrangements to save the day .
There was the TAF and the TSLF ( do n’t ask ) , there were credit lines to investment banks , and the whole thing culminated in March ’s unprecedented , barely legal Bear Stearns rescue  a rescue not of Bear itself , but of its “ counterparties , ” those who were on the other side of its financial bets .
It ’s still far from certain whether all this improvisation has resolved the crisis .
But it was the right thing to do , and for the moment things seem to be calming down .
So two cheers for Mr. Bernanke .
Unfortunately , his very success  if he has succeeded  poses another problem : it gives the financial industry a chance to block reform .
We now know that things that are n’t called banks can nonetheless generate banking crises , and that the Fed needs to carry out bank - type rescues on their behalf .
It follows that hedge funds , special investment vehicles and so on need bank - type regulation .
In particular , they need to be required to have adequate capital .
But while our out - of - control financial system has been bad for the country , it has been very good for wheeler - dealers , who collect huge fees when things seem to be going well , then get to walk away unscathed  indeed , often with large severance packages  when things go wrong .
They do n’t want regulations that would stabilize the economy but cramp their style .
And now that the financial clouds have lifted a bit , the pushback against sensible regulation is in full swing .
Even the Fed ’s very modest proposal to curb abusive mortgage lending with new standards is under fire , and there are worrying signs that the Fed may back down .
Werkzeug started as simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility modules .
It includes a powerful debugger , full featured request and response objects , HTTP utilities to handle entity tags , cache control headers , HTTP dates , cookie handling , file uploads , a powerful URL routing system and a bunch of community contributed addon modules .
Werkzeug is unicode aware and does n't enforce a specific template engine , database adapter or anything else .
It does n't even enforce a specific way of handling requests and leaves all that up to the developer .
Werkzeug is most useful for end user applications which should work on as many server environments as possible ( such as blogs , wikis , bulletin boards , etc. ) .
I just finished the Werkzeug tutorial , and it looks pretty good .
Having coded applications in Aquarium , Django , Pylons , Ruby on Rails , Zope , Plone , etc. , I 've been fascinated by the idea of an anti-framework .
A framework establishes the flow of the application and calls your code at certain points .
That 's the opposite of a library .
A library lets you call its code whenever and however you want .
Werkzeug is a collection of libraries .
There 's a bunch of glue that 's required to tie all the libraries together in order to build a Web application .
Werkzeug gives you some code as an example , but basically , you 're on your own .
Hence , it 's not for everyone , but it 's great if you 're someone like me who hates when things get in his way .
Anyway , it looks simple and clean .
The tutorial was very good .
Here are some other random comments :
The tutorial used Jinja which is a templating system based on Django templates .
Personally , I do n't like Django templates .
( That 's not an insult .
Templating engines are a matter of taste . )
Fortunately , there 's absolutely nothing in Werkzeug tying you to any templating system or ORM .
It does n't even make it any easier to stick to Jinja .
Werkzeug has view functions like Django instead of controller classes with methods like Pylons .
I personally prefer the Pylons approach since I can do a lot of stuff before and after the method call .
On the other hand , I guess that just means I 'd have to make better use of decorators .
It 's interesting because the tutorial itself said " A callable class has huge advantages over a function " when it was talking about the WSGI entry point .
Of course , you 're free to not use the built in URL dispatcher , in which case you could do whatever you want ;) Like Pylons , parameters parsed from the URL path are passed in as arguments to the functions .
Unlike Turbo Gears , form parameters are not passed in as function arguments .
I do n't personally like that approach anyway .
I love the way it 's just a bunch of libraries and you have to write all the glue code .
They show you examples for all the glue code .
I can definitely see where I 'd be less likely to get irritated by frustrating restrictions .
It supports the Pylons goal of having multiple instances of the same application in the same Python interpreter .
Rather than putting all your URL mappings in one place , they also show you how to declare your mappings on a per-view basis using function decorators .
They made it easy to write management scripts that operate outside a Web context , yet understand how to work with the app .
In the tutorial , they hard coded the dburi in the top - level module manage .py .
Especially in the past , I use to get frustrated while using Pylons because I would need the dburi and it would be locked away in a .ini file .
In order to support multiple instances of the same application in the same process , you need a procedure to get access to the correct .ini file , and in strange situations like management scripts , etc. , it was hard to get access to this stuff .
In Werkzeug , you 're on your own to figure out how you want to manage your configuration data .
That 's fine with me -- I 've always disliked .ini files anyway ;)
It looks like you return redirects as instances .
In a lot of systems like Pylons and Aquarium , when you do a redirect , it actually raises an exception to halt processing .
It does look like it 's easy to create a hierarchy of views in a hierarchy of Python modules .
That 's good .
Well , I have n't written an application with it , but it looks nice ;)
Today , too , skillful politicians around the globe have proved adept at manipulating populist sentiment and using democratic structures to erect forms of personalized , authoritarian rule .
President Vladimir Putin has gradually moved Russia , a country increasingly flexing its muscles internationally again , in that direction .
Venezuela , under President Hugo Chávez , has also showed distinct authoritarian tendencies , though these have been at least partly blocked through his defeat in the December referendum to change its Constitution .
In Zimbabwe , President Robert Mugabe has turned democracy into personal rule , ruining his country in the process .
In Pakistan , democracy largely provides a facade for military rule , even if President Pervez Musharraf has now put aside his uniform .
Most worryingly , perhaps , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has used populist support in a pluralist system to push Iran into a hazardous foreign policy , though he does remain formally subordinate to the “ supreme leader , ” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
None of these examples , however , poses a close parallel to what happened in Germany in 1933 .
Neo - fascist movements in Europe can certainly terrorize minorities .
And they have had success in stirring such resentment about immigrants that mainstream political parties have taken account of the swell of feeling .
However , short of some unforeseeable eventualities like major war or , perhaps less unlikely , another meltdown of the economic system , neo - fascist movements will remain on the fringes of politics .
And none of these parties , unappealing though their internal policies are , can today conceive of preparing for a war of conquest with the ultimate aim of a grasp at world power .
Elsewhere , there are  and always will be  nasty forms of authoritarianism ( some supported by democratic governments ) .
But neither in their acquisition of power nor in their use of it do modern authoritarian rulers much resemble Hitler .
International organizations and institutions that did not exist in interwar Europe  the United Nations , the European Union , the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund  also provide some barriers to the sort of calamity that engulfed Germany .
Moreover , democracies under pressure can still pose obstacles to creeping authoritarianism .
Vladimir Putin looks as if he will indeed step down as president and not risk a breach of the Constitution ( though effective power will probably remain in his own hands ) , while Hugo Chávez has been forced ( maybe temporarily ) to give up his ambitions to become a president for life .
Even once Hitler had been appointed chancellor , it took the Reichstag fire , a month later , to begin the destruction of the last vestiges of democracy and pave the way to his full control .
Mercifully , what happened in Germany in 1933 , and its aftermath , will remain a uniquely terrible episode in history .
What took place then reminds us even so of the illusory assumption that democracy will always be a favored choice of a population torn apart by war , facing enormous privations and burning with resentment at national humiliation through perceived foreign interference .
It also reminds us  if such a reminder is necessary  of the need for international cooperation to restrain potential “ mad dogs ” in world politics before they are dangerous enough to bite .
Kleiner Perkins ' enormous $ 100 million iFund for iPhone software development may spark a software gold rush not seen since the heyday of PC - platform development in the 1990s , analysts say .
Silicon Valley VC powerhouse Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers ' surprise pledge Thursday to back iPhone applications developers with a massive investment fund could do as much or more to cement Apple 's leadership role in the burgeoning market for mobile devices as the tech darling 's own announcements to open the device to outside programmers and to better support corporate customers .
" Money from a firm like Kleiner is more than money , it 's sexy money , " says Jerome Engel , a professor at Berkeley 's Haas School of Business who specializes in venture capital and private equity transactions .
" It 's cachet . "
Since Apple first announced the iPhone about a year ago , geeks have been champing at the bit to write code for it , sometimes more for the sheer fun of it than to make money .
Developers have been allowed to write browser - based iPhone apps from the get - go , with dozens of releases to date .
In addition , Apple has been hit with a wave of unauthorized hacks aimed at tapping the phone 's considerable computing power directly , and escaping Apple 's exclusive service deal with AT&T .
When Apple 's SDK is released in June , enthusiasts will certainly continue to tinker with the phone outside of Apple 's more open , yet still restrictive , rules .
But , with the sudden prospects of a serious payday for serious iPhone programmers , the center of gravity will shift dramatically from the underground to the mainstream .
Smartphone apps for the Blackberry , Palm and Windows Mobile devices have been selling at a brisk pace recently , with business tools and entertainment leading the pack .
Smartphone marketplace Handango , which sells mobile apps for dozens of devices over the Web , announced a $ 9.5 million funding round this month and issued a mobile - apps trends report showing entertainment content was the leading sales category for smartphones for the first time in 2007 .
In fact , the report shows that smartphones created and marketed to consumers to use for work and play were among the leading devices for content downloads in 2007 .
Exactly how big the iPhone software market will be , and how quickly it will grow , is anyone 's guess .
But , even assuming rapid immediate growth , the size of Kleiner 's fund took some aback .
" I 'm not really sure there will be that many compelling iPhone apps that would necessitate that kind of investment , " says Buzz Andersen , a longtime Mac developer .
For perspective , that $ 100 million pot is more than 10 times the amount that Bay Partners dangled in front of developers to create apps for Facebook .
And Facebook , a company valued at more than $ 15 billion , was already an established platform when the firm announced that fund .
The iPhone and iPod Touch , on the other hand , hold only promise .
Beyond drawing even more developers to the iPhone , the Kleiner Perkins investment could also influence the types of applications that appear on the device in June ( when Apple opens its iPhone software store ) , fueling more - ambitious projects with larger development teams , Andersen says .
Currently , most Mac and iPhone software companies are small shops , often started by former Apple employees working independently or in small groups .
Kleiner 's $ 100 million could turn that model on its head by helping to cultivate new startups whose sole purpose is to create the next killer app for the iPhone and iPod Touch .
But Apple 's not only luring developers to a mobile platform .
It 's also luring them to the Mac .
One of the limitations of the company 's SDK plan is that making apps for the iPhone and iPod Touch must be done on a Mac .
That means programmers who own an iPhone and a PC will need to go out and purchase a Mac before creating any of their own apps for the device .
That , in turn , could boost Mac sales even more in the coming year , analysts say .
The size of Kleiner 's investment fund makes it clear that the company expects the iPhone and iPod Touch to follow a path similar to that of PCs in the 1990s , when savvy software entrepreneurs seized on the new platform in the process creating some of today 's largest companies .
" A revolutionary new platform is a rare and prized opportunity for entrepreneurs , and that 's exactly what Apple has created with iPhone and iPod touch , " Kleiner Perkins partner John Doerr said in a statement .
" We think several significant new companies will emerge as this new platform evolves , and the iFund will empower them to realize their full potential . "
WASHINGTON —
Here are some things we can look forward to learning about Barack Obama :
That he was mentored in high school by a member of the Soviet - controlled Communist Party .
That he launched his Illinois state Senate campaign in the home of a terrorist and a killer .
That while serving as a state senator , he was a member of a socialist front group .
That his affiliations are so dodgy that he would have trouble getting a government security clearance .
That there is reason to doubt his “ loyalty to the United States . ”
These and many other implausible accusations were offered by a group of conservatives last week — including a living relic from the House Committee on Un - American Activities — in a Capitol Hill basement .
The charges ranged from the absurd to the merely questionable , but anybody who watched the Swift Boat campaign of 2004 make John Kerry look like a war criminal knows that ’s not the point .
The Vast Right - Wing Conspiracy took a blow with Hillary Clinton ’s exit .
But it is regrouping , and finding plenty of sinister things to say about Obama — even if he did n’t trade cattle futures .
The group , assembled by something called America ’s Survival Inc. , gathered in the basement of the Ebenezer Coffee House in Washington .
They shared the stage with a big drum set , and posters documenting items they would seek to tie to Obama : an Students for a Democratic Society newsletter from 1969 ( when he was 7 ) , and a police killing from 1970 ( when he was 8 ) .
“ We believe that any public figure with links to foreign and hostile interests should be asked to explain those associations , ” the organizer , Cliff Kincaid , told about two dozen conservatives and a few reporters .
“ In the case of Obama , a relatively new figure on the national scene , we submit the facts suggest that he would have serious difficulty getting a security clearance in the United States government .
An FBI background check was once used to examine one ’s character , loyalty to the United States and associations . ”
“ He ’s a member of an organization ( that is ) openly a front for two socialist groups , ” reported another participant , Trevor Loudon .
“ Obama was raised and educated in a very Marxist - rich environment , which often would limit his worldview , ” reported a third , Max Friedman .
But the star of the show was the ancient Herbert Romerstein , who once plied his trade for the House Un- American Activities committee in the 1950s .
“ We decided to start going back and seeing what things influenced him even before he was born , ” Romerstein announced without a trace of irony , before tying Obama to the Communist Party of the 1930s in Hawaii and Soviet spies on the island .
“ This is the atmosphere that young Barack Obama grew up in . ”
The smoking gun ?
Obama ’s “ mentor ” during his teens , according to Kincaid , was “ a key member of a Soviet - controlled network that was sponsored by Moscow and active in Hawaii . ”
These accusations fall somewhere between guilt by association and guilt by invention , but the accusers were just getting started .
In college , Obama “ admits selecting Marxist professors among his friends and attending socialist conferences , ” Kincaid went on .
In Chicago , he said , “ Obama launched his political career back in 1995 at the home of communist - terrorist Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn , ” the two Weather Underground figures who have already made a cameo in the campaign .
Kincaid then made the unilateral decision to accuse Dohrn of the 1970 killing of a policeman , a charge no prosecutor has made .
“ The Weather Underground terrorists , ” Romerstein added , “ were instrumental in getting him to office in the first place . ”
Those charges were relatively benign compared with the questions .
One inquired about the link between “ the American left and Islamofascists . ”
Another asked about nefarious influences on Michelle Obama , the senator ’s wife .
A third raised the possibility that Obama ’s “ change ” slogan is based on the 1961 communist “ Movement for Change . ”
It was beginning to sound like a UFO convention .
But the panelists took it seriously , firing questions back at the audience .
“ Was Barack Obama working for Bill Ayers ? ” Kincaid wondered aloud .
Romerstein demanded : “ How come for 20 years he sat in the pews and listened to a raving anti-American racist ?
How did he bring his two young children to this church to hear ( the Rev. Jeremiah ) Wright rave on ? ”
The evidence was compelling enough for participant Friedman .
For him , the Rosetta Stone was Obama ’s chief strategist , David Axelrod , who Friedman alleged was the protege of a man with “ a Communist Party - front record ” in Chicago .
“ The more I look at this , I ’m seeing there are a lot of red - diaper babies around here , ” he deduced .
“ By putting these pieces of the puzzle together , I ’m beginning to see something much bigger . ”
Pain does n’t show up on a body scan and ca n’t be measured in a test .
As a result , many chronic pain sufferers turn to art , opting to paint , draw or sculpt images in an effort to depict their pain .
“ It ’s often much more difficult to put pain into words , which is one of the big problems with pain , ” said Allan I. Basbaum , editor - in - chief of Pain , the medical journal of The International Association for the Study of Pain .
“ You ca n’t articulate it , and you ca n’t see it .
There is no question people often try to illustrate their pain . ”
One of the most famous pain artists is Mexican painter Frida Kahlo , whose work , now on exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art , is imbued with the lifelong suffering she experienced after being impaled during a trolley accident as a teenager .
Her injuries left her spine and pelvis shattered , resulting in multiple operations and miscarriages , and she often depicted her suffering on canvas in stark , disturbing and even bloody images .
Sacramento resident Mark Collen , 47 , is a former insurance salesman who suffers from chronic back pain .
After his regular doctor retired due to illness , Mr. Collen was struggling to find a way to communicate his pain to a new doctor .
Although he has no artistic training , he decided to create a piece of artwork to express his pain to the physician .
“ It was only when I started doing art about pain , and physicians saw the art , that they understood what I was going through , ” Mr. Collen said .
“ Words are limiting , but art elicits an emotional response . ”
Mr. Collen wrote to pain doctors around the world to solicit examples of art from pain patients .
Working with San Francisco college student James Gregory , 21 , who suffers from chronic pain as the result of a car accident , the two created the Pain Exhibit , an online gallery of art from pain sufferers .
The images are evocative and troubling .
“ Some of them are painful even to look at , ” Dr. Basbaum said .
In November , he included an image from the site on the cover of Pain ; it can be seen here .
Finding ways to communicate pain is essential to patients who are suffering , many of whom do n’t receive adequate treatment from doctors .
In January , Virtual Mentor , the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics , reported that certain groups are less likely to receive adequate pain care .
Hispanics are half as likely as whites to receive pain medications in emergency rooms for the same injuries ; older women of color have the highest likelihood of being undertreated for cancer pain ; and being uneducated is a risk factor for poor pain care in AIDS patients , the journal reported .
Some of the images from the Pain Exhibit , like “ Broken People ” by Robert S. Beal of Tulsa , Okla . , depict the physical side of pain .
Others , such as “ Against the Barrier to Life , ” convey the emotional challenges of chronic pain .
“ I feel like I am constantly fighting against a tidal wave of pain in order to achieve some quality of life , ” wrote the work ’s creator , Judith Ann Seabrook of Happy Valley in South Australia .
“ I am in danger of losing the fight and giving up . ”
Mr. Collen said the main goal of the exhibit is to raise awareness about the problem of chronic pain .
However , he said he hopes one day to find a sponsor to take the exhibit on tour .
“ People do n’t believe what they ca n’t see , ” Mr. Collen said .
“ But they see a piece of art an individual created about their pain and everything changes . ”

Another slide show from The Times in February features art created by migraine sufferers .

In general , our videogame protagonists need a set context for their lives before being thrust into action and adventure .
Mario can't just be a dude with a goomba - stomping fetish ; he has to be a plumber .
Marcus Fenix can't just be some chainsaw - wielding jerk ; he needs to be an ex-soldier .
For better or for worse , most game characters need some sort of backstory , often encapsulated in the character 's profession .
But what about the characters whose professions have almost no impact on the way they act once in the actual game ?
What about those heroes and heroines who claim to do one thing as a source of their income , but actually do another ?
What about this videogame characters who suck at their jobs ?
Leisure Suit Larry – " Loser "
The first Leisure Suit Larry game was basedon a single , very simple premise : Larry Laffer is a hideous , creepy loser who needs to get laid .
Larry had to be a loser , otherwise he would n't need the player 's intelligence and puzzle - solving abilities to get him out of ( and into ) sticky situations at every turn .
But what of the sequels ?
Each are built off the same premise , but almost completely ignore the implications of the previous titles .
Larry is a creepy loser who can't get laid … except for all those times he did .
The average LSL title sees our protagonist bed up to four women throughout the course of a twelve hour game -- hardly a batting average to scoff at .
Al Lowe has previously admitted to the difficult , contradictory nature inherent in making a series of games about a " loser " who gets far more sex than the people who are controlling him , but it 's a necessary evil .
He 's gotta be a dork because the game is funnier that way , but he 's gotta get the occasional beej or the player will feel no personal reward for their actions .
Still , though , I 'd hesitate to call anyone who hit this a " loser . "
Max Payne – " Detective "
Detectives collect clues .
Detectives interview witnesses .
Detectives are meticulous , professional , and above all , thoughtful .
The closest Max Payne ever gets to being a detective is running around his NYPD precinct , answering phones and breaking air conditioners .
The rest of the time , Max dives , runs , shoots and bones his way to truth and / or revenge without stopping to examine a single clue , or interview a single witness ( he does ask that one witness about Mona in the precinct during Max Payne 2 , but that had more to do with his penis than his job ) .
I 'm being mildly facetious , of course .
The Payne games would be incredibly different if Max actually thought about what he did before he did it .
He would n't have gotten drugged by Mona in the first game , or tricked by Vlad in the second , which would have dragged down the plots of both games .
Were he a true detective , he'd be too busy using inventory items and interviewing people to perform so much as one bullet - time dodge .
Were he a real snoop , he'd be in an adventure game and not a third - person shooter .
But them 's the breaks -- in order to make the game fun , Max has to be a complete moron who falls for every trap and only shows intelligence when formulating ridiculously convoluted internal monologues .
Columbo never did any of that shit , I can tell you that .
Donkey Kong – " Donkey "
HE'S A GODDAMN GORILLA WHY IS HE NAMED DONKEY WHAT THE FUCK
Mario – " Plumber "
Apart from a brief interlude in Superstar Saga and an even shorter scene in the movie , we never see this so - called " plumber " fix so much as a leaky tap .
Sure , the man spends a lot of his time jumping into and out of man-sized pipes , but so what ?
Given the ease with which he and other characters travel through the Mushroom Kingdom 's underground sewer system , one has to imagine that the mere act of diving into oversized pipework does not warrant an the actual title of " plumber . "
Just look at the guy 's inventory -- flowers , leaves , boots , raccoon costumes .
These are the tools of a drug - addicted furry , not a septic maintenance agent : at no point has Mario ever picked up a wrench , a pipe cleaner , or a plunger .
Dude has been known to carry around a hammer , but we do n't really associate that with plumbing .
Mario supports himself not through work , but through theft .
Did you ever stop to think that Mario does n't actually get a true extra life everytime he steals coins from the Koopalings , but that the 1 - Up merely signifies that he now has the financial means to eat and stay alive for one more day ?
Unless Mario has been maintaining Peach 's pipe system offscreen for the past twenty years -- and I would n't put it past that bitch to reward the man who saved her life with menial labor -- Mario has n't done a day of proper work in his damn life .
Samus Aran – " Bounty Hunter "
Samus Aran is a mass murderer , not a bounty hunter .
Bounty hunters capture escaped convicts and bail jumpers , and they capture them alive .
When Samus Aran sets foot on an alien planet , you best believe that by the time she 's done nothing will ever walk or crawl on that world again .
Samus is n't a bounty hunter , and she is n't even a hitman ; she 's a walking genocide machine .
She 'll kill half the population of your planet , then leave for a few hours , then come back with a new weapon upgrade and kill the other half of your planet so she can get still another new ability .
The woman is a fantastic large - scale killer , but she does n't exhibit any of the restraint or subtlety that one would ascribe to the best bounty hunters .
I do n't wish to argue that Samus is n't doing the right thing by wiping out Metroids and Space Pirates , of course ; someone 's gotta get rid of them , and it might as well by the hot chick in the robot suit who can morph into a fist - sized sphere at the drop of a hat .
Fine .
But that does n't make her a bounty hunter .
Samus sure as hell knows how to backtrack and solve environmental puzzles , but does she know the difficulty of tracking a single target across twelve states ?
Has she ever experienced the difficulty of bringing in an armed , intoxicated felon without killing him ?
How many bounties has she successfully brought in ?
Which bail bondsman does she contract from ?
I highly doubt Samus could answer these questions .
That 's all I 've got for now ; did I miss any obvious ones you 'd like to add to the list ?
Did some of the characters not belong ?
Do you want to tell me the story that everyone already knows concerning the origin of Donkey Kong 's name ?

Question
In university how can I be a famous person ?
Community Answer
University years are about learning and becoming the well - rounded person you wish to be .
It would be a great idea to concentrate on the studies so that you excel and get known for this -- that 's a cool source of fame in university .
Also , get involved in clubs and if you like student politics , get into that .
Other things to try include writing for the university student newspaper / magazine , doing university radio , joining the university 's drama society and being involved in plays and rallying students if there is something to protest about .
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - A man politely waited his turn in a queue at a busy central Sydney post office before jumping over the counter , grabbing money from two tills and running off , police said on Thursday .
Police said the man dropped some of the money and a large knife as he escaped , pursued by post office staff , following the Wednesday afternoon robbery in the heart of Sydney ’s central business district .
Police are hunting the man , said to be in his 20s .
Note : this is not Linux - specific .
the commands are essentially the same on the windows version of mplayer .
The GIMP is also cross platform .
see the comments for more details .
MPlayer is a pretty powerful tool for processing video files .
It has a built - in command line option that will export specified movie frames to a GIF .
Such a feature seems like it would make the guide I 'm presenting here obsolete , but the problem with the feature is that the resultant GIF looks terrible : too few colors .
As far as I 've seen , the best way to get good quality animated GIFs using only free software involves using a combination of MPlayer 's command line tools and a little bit of elbow grease in The GIMP .
We will export the desired segment of video to a series of JPEG files , then use The GIMP to combine those files into a nicely animating GIF that should look nearly as good as the original video .
I believe that it is possible to get MPlayer and The GIMP together in a script that will allow the end user to simply point the script to the desired movie file and the desired segment and the script will do all the " dirty work " and create the GIF .
This is my end goal , but I have not taken the time necessary to learn any of GIMP 's scripting language .
If there is a pre-existing solution that allows one to do what I am trying to show here , I 'd love to know about it , so please let me know .
Step 1 ( for Debian or Ubuntu users ) :
sudo apt - get install gimp mplayer
Step 2 :
mplayer - ao null - loop 0 - ss 0:11:22 - endpos 5 file.avi
from 11:22
five seconds later
loop infinitely
is set to null
Step 3 :
mplayer - ao null - ss 0:11:22 - endpos 5 file.avi - vo jpeg:outdir=moviedirectory
output the segment to a series of jpeg files in a directory called " moviedirectory "
Step 4 :
Thanks for reading !
If you have any questions or suggestions , please leave a comment .
This command will display the segment of file .avi on your screen that runsto( 11:27 ) .
It willuntil you close the window or send a ctrl+c to the terminal window .
This command is useful for figuring out what your GIF will look like before you make it .
The audio output will not be heard ( This command actually creates the jpeg files you will need to make your animated gif .
It is similar to the other command , but nothing is displayed on screen , and the command will not loop forever .
The command willNow that we have our directory full of jpegs , we should open the first of these files in The GIMP .
Then , open the remainder of the images in the directory as layers ( File -> Open As Layers ) .
Every image in that directory should now be a layer .
Now save the file as a .gif and choose to " save as animation " as opposed to " flatten image . "
Click export .
Lastly , it is important to make sure " loop forever " is checked if you want a GIF that loops forever .
The other options here can drastically change the effect of your gif because they change the speed that the gif is displayed at .
A relatively fast gif will have a 15 millisecond delay between frames .
The default delay of 100 ms is a bit slow in my opinion .
Under frame disposal where unspecified I select " one frame per layer . "
I check " Use delay entered above for all frames " and " Use disposal entered above for all frames . "
Here are examples of the end result :
If you find that your image is too large , it is often helpful to resize it to be a bit smaller .
This can help with the image 's performance .
As Firefox is often the platform where people will be viewing your animated gif files , it is also a good tool to use to test them to see what the final product looks like .
If you liked this or thought it was cool , you should read my guide on using FFmpeg

Just leave a comment !
How does Slashbot work ?
There is a post in the blog that describes our approach but the concept is as follows .
The “ notes ” to be played are the brightest images on the screen .
This means we can look at a black and white ( actually grayscale ) version of the video and observe “ notes ” very easily .
The brightness of a pixel is defined by a voltage between 0 V ( black ) and 1 V ( white ) .
By using NI LabVIEW to observe the waveform of the video signal , we monitor specific pixels on an individual line of video .
When a “ note ” crosses that line , we see a spike in the signal ’s voltage .
Depending on where the spike occurred in the waveform , we can determine which note needs to be played by the robot .
How long did it take to make Slashbot
This was a semester long project that began in January 2008 .
Our team would work on Slashbot two days a week for about 4 - 5 hours each day .
We had a working design after a couple months .
We then spent a month tweaking and improving the overall design and performance .
So in all , it took about three months from design proposal to fully functioning .
Why use the robot to press the buttons ?
Would n’t it be better to wire a signal directly to the controller ’s electronics ?
You could probably achieve 100 % that way .
This is a valid question .
From a purely performance standpoint , wiring control signals directly to the game would likely have improved the system ’s accuracy .
However , there are already existing solutions that implement this approach .
It was very important for us to create a system without hacking the game controller .
We wanted our robot to have a human element to it .
By physically seeing the buttons being pressed , someone watching could more easily relate to Slashbot .
We wanted to blur the lines between man and machine .
Plus , it is REALLY cool to see the actuators firing at break - neck ( or “ break - guitar ” ) speed !
Can you make it play “ Through the Fire and Flames ” on Expert ?
This is by far the most common request .
For those unfamiliar with Guitar Hero 3 , “ Through the Fire and Flames ” by Dragon Force is notoriously the game ’s most challenging song .
It is extremely fast and includes intricate solos lasting several minutes .
To answer the question , YES !
We can make Slashbot play TTFAF and have done so .
At our project demonstration day at Texas A&M a worthy challenger played against Slashbot .
The robot finished with 68 % .
So what ’s the problem ?
Many have speculated that the actuators would not be fast enough to react to the incredible speed of the song , but this is not the case .
The problem lies in the “ note ” detection software .
Our algorithm currently has difficult differentiating between long strings of the same colored note and the long bar that appears for held notes .
For the long strings of notes , Slashbot will strum on just the first note because the video signal is very similar to that of a held note .
We are working to improve this .
Can Slashbot use Star Power or the whammy bar ?
Slashbot does use Star Power .
The game allows two ways to activate Star Power , by lifting the neck of the guitar or by pressing the “ Select ” button .
We have mounted an actuator above the “ Select ” button .
Its fires roughly every 10 seconds .
There is no effect from pressing “ Select ” unless Star Power is available .
As for whammy , we have the software implemented to handle it , but have yet to attach a motor to move the bar .
We may eventually add this feature .
What does the future hold for Slashbot ?
The main purpose of Slashbot was to complete our requirements for our Electrical and Computer Engineering degrees .
That has been accomplished .
We have been asked to demonstrate Slashbot at some public appearances , details TBD .
We may make some improvements and will post any news here on the blog .
I installed the Visual Studio 2008 Feature Pack today – which , by the way , you will not find if you use Check for Updates on the Visual Studio 2008 Help menu – and noticed this paragraph in the setup agreement :
What ’s this all about ?
Microsoft has not said so , but it seems likely to be part of the company ’s war against OpenOffice .
The efforts of Sun and others to improve OpenOffice , along with all the XML standardization brouhaha , prodded Microsoft into delivering the most significant Office upgrade for many years .
One of its intentions was to increase the differentiation between Microsoft Office and OpenOffice .
The strategy would not work if some future OpenOffice just copied the feature , hence the license .
The unintended consequences concern me .
Until now , you could pretty much use the out - of - the - box UI components in Visual Studio and not worry about licensing .
That has now changed .
According to Microsoft if you use any element of the Office user interface , for which the feature update supplies new classes , then you have to agree to a separate license .
Is this a burden ?
Well , the licensing page is now out of date , because it says “ The program does not involve code ” , but the feature pack provides what it calls “ MFC C++ library source code for the Microsoft Office Fluent User Interface . “
However , Microsoft says that the license is free and covers :
… applications on any platform , except for applications that compete directly with the five Office applications that currently have the new UI ( Microsoft Word , Excel , PowerPoint , Outlook , and Access )
What does it mean , to “ compete directly ” ?
It sounds like the sort of thing lawyers could have fun with .
Further , if you read the license details and FAQ , it is clear that you take on a further obligation , which is to comply with Microsoft ’s Office Design Guidelines , and even to update your application if Microsoft changes them :
Your Licensed UI must comply with the Design Guidelines .
If Microsoft notifies you that the Design Guidelines have been updated or that you are not complying with the Design Guidelines , you will make the necessary changes to comply as soon as you reasonably can , but no later than your next product release that is 6 months or more from the date you receive notice .
OK , so let ’s say you are developing some software for a customer .
You deliver the app ; customer pays you .
Now Microsoft brings out Office 2009 , changes the guidelines , and says you must update the app , even though the customer is happy with it as - is .
Who will pay ?
I guess you would need to agree beforehand ; but it is a disincentive to using the fluent UI .
Presuming you do not want to sign up , avoid all the CMFCRibbon * classes .
Microsoft has helpfully commented these with a paragraph that says :
License terms to copy , use or distribute the Fluent UI are available separately .
Would any of this stand up in court ?
I have no idea , but I ’d be reluctant to sign up or to use these classes lest I might have to find out .

The Italian parliament may have unwittingly legalized sharing music over P2P networks .
A new copyright law , passed by both houses of parliament , would allow Italians to freely share music over the Internet as long as it was noncommercial and the music degraded .
Italian copyright attorney Andrea Monti told Italian paper la Repubblica ( Google translation dug up on Slashdot ) that whoever authored the law failed to take into account that the word " degraded " has a " very precise meaning . "
All music sold on the major music download sites is degraded , whether it's a 192 kbps MP3 or 128 kbps AAC file .
Under the new law , music fans would be able to freely share their ( not lossless ) music libraries over P2P networks .
The law does limit such sharing to " educational or scientific " use , but the effect of the law will be to make prosecuting P2P use more difficult , Monti believes .
Despite that , the president of the Italian counterpart to the RIAA told la Repubblica that the law does n't faze his group because of those limits .
The new law is a another blow to the music industry , which has seen some significant legal setbacks in Europe over the past few months .
Earlier this week , the European Court of Justice ruled that ISPs could not divulge the identities of their subscribers in civil copyright cases , just criminal cases .
Such cases are increasingly difficult to bring in some EU nations , as German prosecutors have refused to pursue criminal infringement complaints , calling them " petty offenses . "
A Swiss antipiracy firm dodged this problem by filing criminal copyright infringement cases , then switching to civil actions once the identity of the ' Net user in question was obtained ; the Swiss government has now told them to drop this practice .
Should Italian lawmakers decide that their inadvertent decriminalizing of music file - sharing is n't such a good idea , they 'll have to pass another law .
The legislation they just passed can no longer be altered , needing only publication in the Official Journal before becoming law .
MOST people have experienced the feeling , after a taxing mental work - out , that they can not be bothered to make any more decisions .
If they are forced to , they may do so intuitively , rather than by reasoning .
Such apathy is often put down to tiredness , but a study published recently in Psychological Science suggests there may be more to it than that .
Whether reason or intuition is used may depend simply on the decision - maker 's blood - sugar level — which is , itself , affected by the process of reasoning .
E.J. Masicampo and Roy Baumeister of Florida State University discovered this by doing some experiments on that most popular of laboratory animals , the impoverished undergraduate .
They asked 121 psychology students who had volunteered for the experiment to watch a silent video of a woman being interviewed that had random words appearing in bold black letters every ten seconds along the perimeter of the video .
This was the part of the experiment intended to be mentally taxing .
Half of the students were told to focus on the woman , to try to understand what she was saying , and to ignore the words along the perimeter .
The other half were given no instructions .
Those that had to focus were exerting considerable self - control not to look at the random words .
When the video was over , half of each group was given a glass of lemonade with sugar in it and half was given a glass of lemonade with sugar substitute .
Twelve minutes later , when the glucose from the lemonade with sugar in it had had time to enter the students ' blood , the researchers administered a decision - making task that was designed to determine if the participant was using intuition or reason to make up his mind .
The students were asked to think about where they wanted to live in the coming year and given three accommodation options that varied both in size and distance from the university campus .
Two of the options were good , but in different ways : one was far from the campus , but very large ; the other was close to campus , but smaller .
The third option was a decoy , similar to one of the good options , but obviously not quite as good .
If it was close to campus and small , it was not quite as close as the good close option and slightly smaller .
If it was far from campus and large , it was slightly smaller than the good large option and slightly farther away .
A drink to decide
Psychologists have known for a long time that having a decoy option in a decision - making task draws people to choose a reasonable option that is similar to the decoy .
Dr Masicampo and Dr Baumeister suspected that students who had been asked to work hard during the video and then been given a drink without any sugar in it would be more likely to rely on intuition when making this decision than those from the other three groups .
And that is what happened ; 64 % of them were swayed by the decoy .
Those who had either not had to exert mental energy during the showing of the video or had been given glucose in their lemonade , used reason in their decision - making task and were less likely to be swayed by the decoy .
It is not clear why intuition is independent of glucose .
It could be that humans inherited a default nervous system from other mammals that was similar to intuition , and that could make snap decisions about whether to fight or flee regardless of how much glucose was in the body .
Whatever the reason , the upshot seems to be that thinking is , indeed , hard work .
And important decisions should not be made on an empty stomach .
The Huffington Post has uncovered a tape of Hillary telling some fundraisers at a private meeting that she hates the Netroots and Democratic activists , especially MoveOn .
Ironically , it was also the Huffington Post that revealed Obama ’s private meeting with fundraisers that led to the entire “ bitter ” debacle .
( Funny , Hillary spoke to MoveOn just last year , and praised their work ( listen to the audio , it ’s good ) .
She “ personally welcomes ” MoveOn ’s work and says “ I am grateful for your work . ”
And let ’s not forget why and how MoveOn started .
They wanted Congress to MoveOn from impeaching Bill Clinton over Monica Lewinksy .
This is yet another example of the Clinton ’s throwing a key ally , a key defender , under the bus when it ’s expedient . )
You see , MoveOn and the rest of the Netroots is made up of people who are n’t very American or patriotic .
They did n’t even support the war in Afghanistan , Hillary claims , so these are the kind of people she has to deal with .
They ’re also the reason that Hillary did n’t win the caucuses , because of those crazy MoveOn people – I hear they would even threaten Hillary ’s poor caucus - going supporters .
And what ’s more , those MoveOn people raised a ton of money for Obama , Hillary claims , so in reality , Obama did n’t raise that much money from real Americans .
So Hillary ’s entire argument , as always , is that everyone really loves her , nobody really likes Obama , but somehow the system is screwing her and making it look like she ’s losing , when she ’s really not .
She ’s winning .
Sure , she ’s not winning in delegates , or popular vote , or number of states won , or in donations , but she ’s winning in the area that really matters : Excuses .
Here is what Hillary had to say :
“ Moveon.org endorsed [ Sen. Barack Obama ] — which is like a gusher of money that never seems to slow down , ” Clinton said to a meeting of donors .
“ We have been less successful in caucuses because it brings out the activist base of the Democratic Party .
MoveOn did n’t even want us to go into Afghanistan .
I mean , that ’s what we ’re dealing with .
And you know they turn out in great numbers .
And they are very driven by their view of our positions , and It ’s primarily national security and foreign policy that drives them .
I do n’t agree with them .
They know I do n’t agree with them .
So they flood into these caucuses and dominate them and really intimidate people who actually show up to support me . ”
Oh , and guess what ?
Hillary lied .
MoveOn ’s Executive Director Eli Pariser just gave the following statement to the Huffington Post :
“ Senator Clinton has her facts wrong again .
MoveOn never opposed the war in Afghanistan , and we set the record straight years ago when Karl Rove made the same claim .
The larger irony is that Obama never did a lot of outreach to the Netroots .
His outreach was actually the worst of any of the big campaigns ( Edwards was the best , and Hillary ’s was still better than Obama ’s , which did n’t really exist at all ) .
Yet , somehow , the Netroots still ended up supporting Obama over Hillary , even though they did n’t know his people , but they sure knew hers .
Just food for thought .
It ’s funny .
Hillary was a big fan of the online grassroots ( or Netroots , as we call it ) when ABC was defaming her husband in its fictional account of September 11 , “ The Path to 9/11 . ”
At that time , we led a ferocious counterattack that put ABC in its place by exposing the serious errors in ABC ’s bizarrely inaccurate account of that day ’s fateful events .
The Clintons did n’t seem to have much of a problem with the Netroots when we came to their rescue .
But now that we ’re defending Obama against the same biased attacks from ABC , Hillary dismisses us with a wave of her regal palm .
To paraphrase Rev. Martin Niemöller , Hillary has embraced so many right - wing talking points in her campaign , and bashed so many core Democratic constituencies ( blacks , gays , gun control advocates , and now the Netroots ) , that pretty soon she ’ll have no more Democrats left to blame .
Nor will she have any Democrats left to support what has become a truly pathetic caricature of what was once a great Democratic family .
NAZRAN , Russia ( Reuters ) - A top judge in Russia ’s southern troubled province of Ingushetia who had led trials of Islamic rebels was shot dead on Sunday , local police said .
Khasan Yandiyev , deputy head of Ingushetia ’s Supreme Court , was killed while changing a tire on his car near the town of Karabulak , a regional interior ministry spokesman said .
“ No one heard the shot , perhaps it was a sniper or assailants used a gun with silencer , ” he added saying that Yandiyev died of wounds in an ambulance car on the way to hospital .
The spokesman said an investigation was under way , but could give no further details .
Russian news agencies said earlier that Yandiyev , 51 , was killed from an assault rifle .
As a senior judge , Yandiyev has chaired trials of both Islamic rebels and corrupt officials , Russian media said .
Ingushetia , one of Russia ’s poorest regions , has seen a rise in violence in recent months , including attacks on police and the military .
Ingushi authorities blame Muslim radicals , both local and from neighboring Chechnya , for the attacks .
Their opponents say the new bout of violence is a result of the local government ’s ineffective and repressive policies .

Rob Lowe : Another Scandal Brewing
has reportedly filed separate lawsuits against three former employees , accusing them of breach of contract , defamation and intentional distress .
In one of the suits , Lowe accuses an ex-nanny of engaging in a scheme to hurt the couple by spreading malicious lies .
Another ex-nanny is accused of falsely claiming to have a personal and intimate relationship with Lowe , and also repeatedly expressing romantic interest in Rob , claiming that Lowe sexually harassed her and that Sheryl Berkoff Lowe was an abusive employer .
Lowe claims a former chef engaged in sex on their bed with third parties when the family was out of town , stole prescription drugs from the Lowe's , broke several security cameras and overcharged them for food .
He also allegedly made statements to various people that Sheryl was heartless , cold and unclean .
The AP confirms that Lowe and his wife filed a lawsuit Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court , seeking $ 1,000,000 or more in damages , and charging Laura Boyce with violating a confidentiality agreement , defamation and infliction of emotional distress on Lowe and his family .
Lowe claims the nanny is trying to extort money from the couple and is demanding $ 1.5 million by the end of this week for her silence .
Lowe took the bull by the horns and decided to come out of the gate before his wayward employees could go public with their claims .
Based on the three pronged lawsuit , it looks like the employees formed an alliance to back up the claims of the others .
This battle comes 20 years after Lowe ’s 1988 sex scandal , in which he was caught on tape having sex with a teenager .
The actor was involved in a sex scandal over a videotape of him having sex with two females , one of whom was sixteen .
The incident occurred in Atlanta while Lowe was attending the 1988 Democratic National Convention .
Lowe has asserted that he did not know that the second girl was underage , and it was confirmed that the two had met at a bar , which the girl entered by lying about her age .
Further complicating the issue was another part of the same tape that leaked at the time , showing Lowe , a young American model called " Jennifer , " and " Justin Morris " having a menage a trois in a hotel room in Paris .
This part of the original tape was made commercially available , and was sold as one of the first commercially available celebrity sex tapes , damaging Lowe 's public image .
Lowe entered a rehabilitation clinic for alcohol and sex addiction .
Eventually , his career rebounded , and Lowe mocked his own behavior during two post - scandal appearances as host of SNL .
This entire case sounds like Lowe is scrambling to head off another full blown scandal .
Seeking $ 1 million in damages from his employees is amusing .
Does he honestly think they have that kind of money - even collectively ?
Of course he does n't .
His lawyer is trying to silence these people swiftly before Rob Lowe is forced to explain away some salacious accusations .
He 's done that once and barely escaped with his career .
The second time is not always the charm .
Lowe , 44 , had a prominent role as Sam Seaborn on The West Wing .
He currently has a recurring role as Senator Robert McCallister on Brothers & Sisters .
He has been married to Sheryl Berkoff for 16 years .
She was a Hollywood makeup artist who worked on the sets of fourteen big name movies prior to marrying Lowe .
They have two sons , Edward , 14 and John , 12 .
The family lives in Montecito , California .

The Department of Justice yesterday announced that it has created a National Tax Defier Initiative :
Nathan J. Hochman , Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department ’s Tax Division , announced the creation of the National Tax Defier Initiative or TAXDEF .
The purpose of this initiative is to reaffirm and reinvigorate the Tax Division ’s commitment to investigate , pursue and , where appropriate , prosecute those who take concrete action to defy and deny the fundamental validity of the tax laws .
...
This initiative is aimed at stopping those tax defiers who do not meet their federal tax obligations and seek to transfer those obligations to their neighbor ’s back .
The tax defier is not someone who has a legitimate or factual dispute about the amount of tax due .
The tax defier is not someone who is merely exercising his or her First Amendment rights to challenge the tax policy choices that Congress has made .
Instead , the tax defier is someone who rejects the legal foundation of the tax system , despite decades of legal precedent upholding the system ’s constitutional and statutory validity , and who takes specific and concrete action to violate the law .
It is this tax defier conduct , which results in fraudulent claims , frivolous returns and bogus schemes , that threatens the foundation of our tax system and must be vigorously countered .
This activity not only wastes limited governmental investigative , administrative and judicial resources , but it also fundamentally undermines the public ’s confidence in the fairness of the tax system .
Although the Tax Division and the IRS have been effective at times in combating tax defier activity , the problem demands constant vigilance .
Today I want to renew and revitalize the Tax Division ’s commitment to combating tax defier activity by announcing the creation of the National Tax Defier Initiative , or TAXDEF .
Jennifer Ihlo will serve as the National Director of TAXDEF and she will report directly to me .
Her primary mission will be to ensure that we are using all of the tools in our enforcement arsenal to address this nationwide problem .
The TAXDEF initiative will :
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon : Economists ’ Version
Justin Lahart at the Wall Street Journal suggests a new party game for economists ( or at least something to keep you awake if a conference gets dull ) : Six Degrees of Joe Stiglitz .
He ’s suggesting the econ version of the Paul Erdos number in math :
If you drew a diagram linking different mathematicians , many of the lines would cross at Erdos .
That ’s given rise to what ’s known as an Erdos number .
People who collaborated directly with Erdos have an Erdos number of one .
People who collaborated with those collaborators have an Erdos number of two .
And so on .
Erdos , who died in 1996 , has an Erdos number of zero .
Why choose Stiglitz ?
Well , Stiglitz himself has an Erdos number of four , which means that any economist ’s Erdos number is at least as low as their Stiglitz number , plus four .
But more to the point , Stiglitz has coauthored broadly and written across many fields , so is arguably the most Erdos - like figure in modern economics .
I ’ll bite : My Stiglitz number is three , and I can get there at least three different ways :
Stiglitz -Diamond–Blanchard - Wolfers , Stiglitz - Atkinson–Leigh - Wolfers , or Stiglitz - Blinder–Reis - Wolfers .
Steve Levitt is also a three : Stiglitz - Sachs –Poterba - Levitt , and so Steve endows both Stephen Dubner and Sudhir Venkatesh with a four .
Dan Hamermesh has written so many papers that it is hard to know , but I ’m guessing he ’s also a three : Stiglitz - Azariadis–Drazen - Hamermesh .
Among Freakonomics bloggers , Ian Ayres has the lowest Stiglitz number at two : Stiglitz - Nalebuff - Ayres , or Stiglitz - Edlin - Ayres .
( And Ayres is also a secondary reason for Levitt ’s three . )
Need help calculating your Stiglitz number ?
Here are the rules of what constitutes a fair link .
And here ’s Stiglitz ’s C.V .
My guess is that some of the key links ( people with a Stiglitz number of one ) will turn out to be : Aghion , Akerlof , Arnott , Atkinson , Azariadis , Basu , Blinder , Boadway , Boskin , Brock , Cass , Dasgupta , Diamond , Dixit , Easterly , Eaton , Edlin , Frydman , Fudenberg , Furman , Gilbert , Greenwald , Grossman , Heal , Hellman , Hosios , Jaffee , Nalebuff , Newberry , Niskanen , Orszag , Przeworski , Radner , Rothschild , Sachs , Sah , Salop , Shapiro , Shell , Solow , Stern , Stockman , Tirole , Walsh , Weiss , and Woodford — just to list the first couple of dozen among the multitude of people boasting a Stiglitz number of one .
And when we are done playing the Six Degrees of Joseph Stiglitz , let me suggest that for subsequent rounds we try Six Degrees of : Larry Summers , Gary Becker , Milton Friedman , Kenneth Arrow , Paul Samuelson , John Maynard Keynes , and Alfred Marshall .
These get much harder with earlier generations of economists , because team production of research is increasing .
It was supposed to be a quick war and a cheap one .
Five years later , 160,000 U.S. troops are still in Iraq .
And the costs keep piling up - $ 12 billion every month - putting a strain on an already faltering economy .
The United States has poured more than $ 500 billion into Iraq , mostly for military operations .
But that figure is just a small piece of the much larger bill that taxpayers will pay in the future .
Because the money for the war is being borrowed , interest payments could add another $ 615 billion .
A heavily depleted military will have to be rebuilt at a cost of $ 280 billion .
Disability benefits and health care for Iraq war veterans , many of them severely injured , could add another half - trillion dollars over their lifetime .
Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz and Harvard University public finance Professor Laura Bilmes , both of whom served in the Clinton administration , have included those calculations in a new study of the war 's long - term costs .
Their estimate of the war 's price tag : $ 3 trillion .
" We are a rich country , and we can , in some sense , afford it .
It 's not going to bankrupt us , " said Stiglitz , a Columbia University professor , who published the findings in a new book , " The Three Trillion Dollar War . "
But Stiglitz said the war has contributed to a weakening economy - partly by feeding the instability that has sent oil prices to record highs - and has saddled the country with debts that will make it harder to respond to a recession , fix Social Security or meet other future needs .
" The best way to think about it is :
What could we have done with $ 3 trillion ? " he said .
" What is the best way to spend the money , either for security or for our national needs in the long run ?
The stronger the American economy , the more prepared we are to meet any threat .
If we weaken the American economy , we are less prepared . "
The White House has not disputed the analysis by Stiglitz and Bilmes but instead has attacked the idea that the escalating costs are a reason to withdraw .
" We have to ask ourselves what the cost would be of doing nothing , or of ratcheting back when we 're not ready to ratchet back , in terms of making sure that Iraq does not become a safe haven for al Qaeda , making sure that Afghanistan does n't fall back into the hands of the Taliban , " said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino .
The government 's own figures show the war 's costs are rising .
The Congressional Research Service estimates that $ 526 billion has been spent in Iraq since 2003 .
The Congressional Budget Office calculates that spending on Iraq and Afghanistan combined will cost $ 1.2 trillion to $ 1.7 trillion by 2017 .
War cost in perspective
In historical perspective , the Iraq conflict is already one of the most expensive conflicts in U.S. history .
The price tag in Iraq now is more than double the cost of the Korean War and a third more expensive than the Vietnam War , which lasted 12 years .
Stiglitz and Bilmes calculate that it will be at least 10 times as costly as the 1991 Gulf War and twice the cost of World War I .
Only World War II was more expensive .
That four - year war - in which 16 million U.S. troops were deployed on two fronts , fighting against Germany and Japan - cost about $ 5 trillion in inflation - adjusted dollars .
The latest numbers are a far cry from the cost estimates made by war supporters in the run-up to the March 2003 invasion .
In September 2002 , White House economic adviser Larry Lindsey told the Wall Street Journal the war would cost between $ 100 billion and $ 200 billion .
He was immediately excoriated by others in the administration .
White House budget director Mitch Daniels called the estimate " very , very high . "
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called it " baloney . "
Estimate revised down
The White House and Pentagon came back in January 2003 with a number that was more palatable - $ 50 billion to $ 60 billion .
Rumsfeld 's deputy , Paul Wolfowitz , boasted that Iraq would pay for its own reconstruction with increased oil revenues .
Economists say the trouble with the early estimates was they focused only on the cost of invading Iraq and then bringing the troops home .
No one budgeted for a long occupation .
" It 's quite apparent in hindsight the reason the war has been so expensive is because we have now maintained well over 100,000 and maybe closer to 200,000 troops in theater for five years , " said Steven Davis , a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business , who co-authored a 2003 paper comparing the cost of invading Iraq with the cost of containing former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein .
" There was an active resistance in the administration to thinking about the long - term cost impacts of this decision , " said Davis , who 's now advising Republican presidential candidate Sen.
John McCain on economic issues .
" And it 's not just the administration .
The Congress did n't do its job .
I do n't think most of the media did a good job .
That period in 2002 , early 2003 , was not one of the best examples of American democracy in action .
There 's a lot of blame to go around . "
What war cost ?
Stiglitz , who opposes the war , sees a more concerted effort to hide the costs from the American people .
Unlike previous wars - where taxes were raised to pay for the conflict - President Bush and a then - Republican Congress cut taxes .
That led the public to believe they would not have to sacrifice , he said .
" They wanted to keep the costs away from the American people , " Stiglitz said .
" They realized this was a war of choice and if they told people , ' We want to go to war and the price tag is going to be $ 8 trillion or $ 2 trillion ' - they might have said , ' No , thank you . ' "
The costs of veterans ' benefits alone could be staggering .
More than 1.6 million soldiers already have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan , nearly 4,000 have been killed and almost 30,000 have been injured .
By December , 224,000 had applied for disability benefits because of health issues , and 260,000 had been treated at veterans ' medical facilities .
Improved battlefield medicine and better body armor have helped many Iraq veterans survive attacks that would have killed soldiers in past wars .
But they are often left with multiple serious injuries .
" It means more expensive care and more long - term care , " said Joe Violante , national legislative director of Disabled American Veterans , which represents 1.2 million veterans .
" You have individuals with severe traumatic brain injuries that are going to need a lot of assistance for the rest of their lives .
Whether that 's inpatient or whether it 's outpatient , it 's going to be very costly over their lifetime . "
Toll on the military
The war also has taken its toll on the military itself .
About 40 percent of the Army and Marine Corps ' equipment - tanks , helicopters , humvees - is in Iraq , and it 's wearing out at six times the peacetime rate .
Defense analysts say it could take 20 years to " reset " the armed forces .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , in Washington last month , said that about half of the California National Guard 's equipment is in Iraq or Afghanistan .
The Pentagon has not said when it will be returned or replaced .
" It 's not fair to the states , " Schwarzenegger said .
Economists have been alarmed at the growing pile of debt to pay for the war , 40 percent of which is held by foreign interests .
Robert Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman Sachs , warned Congress last month against continuing to pass on the war 's costs to future generations .
He cited a recent Senate committee report showing that the cost of servicing the Iraq war debt will exceed federal spending on education and health research next year .
" The point is that there are major trade - offs here , " Hormats testified .
" Is the continued cost of the Iraq war worth the commitment of resources that potentially could be used otherwise ? "

A14
On March 31st more than 15,000 workers at a Nike - contracted factory in southern Vietnam went on strike to demand higher wages in the face of rising prices .
Although the strike was called off on April 2nd — after the workers were offered a 10 % pay rise — the factory has been forced to close temporarily owing to fights between returning workers and those continuing to demand higher wages .
The incident is the most recent instance of a marked surge in inflation - fuelled labour unrest in Vietnam , which has primarily affected the garment and footwear sectors .
There have been around 600 strikes in the past 15 months , according to the labour ministry .
Vietnam 's annual inflation rate has soared to 19.4 % year on year in March , from 15.7 % in February , hitting double - digits for a fifth consecutive month .
Food - price inflation , which holds around a 40 % weighting in the consumer price index and has been accelerating rapidly since mid-2007 , continues to be the main factor driving up the general price level .
The cost of food and foodstuffs surged by 30.6 % year on year in March , up from a 25.2 % gain in February .
Inflationary pressures have also been amplified by large capital inflows that have increased the money supply .
The government 's expansionary fiscal policy stance , combined with the central bank 's inability to rein in credit growth thus far , has exacerbated the problem .
Vietnam 's government is acutely aware of the challenges rampant inflation poses to the country 's economic and social stability .
In the past few weeks it has unveiled a raft of measures designed to dampen inflationary pressures .
However , the implementation of these measures continues to pose policy dilemmas , given that they could also slow economic growth and widen the trade deficit .
Policy dilemmas
The government has begun to target consumer price inflation aggressively .
In March it lowered import duties on certain products , raised interest rates and introduced a comprehensive strategy to fight rising prices .
A key part of its strategy has been to require commercial banks buy a total of D20.3 trn ( US $ 1.26 bn ) in compulsory treasury bills , which has decreased liquidity in the market , and to cap dong deposit rates .
In addition , the State Bank of Vietnam ( SBV , the central bank ) has raised the discount rate to 6 % ( from 4.5 % previously ) and the base rate to 8.75 % ( from 8.25 % ) .
The SBV has also lowered its target for credit growth in 2008 , saying it will closely monitor banks ' lending activities .
But the SBV faces a dilemma : it must reign in credit growth to manage inflation while simultaneously promoting overall economic growth .
While its current strategy may dampen credit growth , it has also raised fears that Vietnam 's economic growth rate — which fell to a two - year low of 7.4 % in the first quarter of 2008 — could slow further .
The government has pledged to ensure that credit growth will be sufficient for continued strong real GDP growth , but it remains to be seen whether policymakers can find the right balance .
In addition to draining liquidity from the market , the SBV has widened the trading band within which the dong is allowed to fluctuate on a daily basis , from 0.75 % to 1 % .
The dong has been appreciating against the US dollar in recent months , owing to relatively high capital inflows and buoyant inward remittances .
This latest move by the SBV is intended to allow the currency to strengthen further in order to alleviate inflationary pressures .
It also poses a dilemma , however .
Allowing the dong to appreciate will make imports cheaper , but it could also lead to a worsening of the trade deficit .
In the first quarter of 2008 the US dollar value of Vietnam 's imports rose by 62.5 % year on year , while exports were valued at US $ 13bn , up by nearly 23 % year on year .
The net result was a trade deficit of US $ 7.4bn , equivalent to 56.5 % of total export value during the same period .
Outlook
As the government wrestles with these dilemmas , the pressure on prices is set to increase .
Vietnam has announced plans to cut rice exports by up to 1 m tonnes this year , but rising food prices are likely to continue to buoy the price index .
With headline inflation exceeding the Economist Intelligence Unit 's expectations , we will make a significant upwards revision to our 2008 inflation forecast , which currently stands at 13.4 % .
However , we still expect inflation to moderate in 2009 as the expansion of the economy slows and the effects of tighter monetary begin to be felt .
DIGG THIS
In 2000 , George W. Bush ran for the Presidency as a Republican under the banner of " compassionate conservatism . "
However , with respect to the War on Drugs , his actions and his words never met during his time in the White House , as he decided to stay the failed course charted by his predecessors .
2008 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul is correct when he speaks to the fact that there is nothing compassionate or conservative about the continuation of America 's failed War on Drugs .
By most surveys taken and estimates made , drug use has remained at steady levels since the War on Drugs was launched in the 1970s and even before that .
To be sure , there are occasional fluctuations here and there depending on various trends such as the rise and decline in popularity of one substance versus another .
Each year the U.S. increases the federal budget for the DEA and other anti-drug efforts such as television advertisements and DARE programs in the public schools , yet drugs of all types are readily available all over the nation .
Ron Paul understands this with a clarity that seems missing from many of the other candidates in both political parties .
In one of Paul 's writings , he noted that :
" For the first 140 years of our history , we had essentially no Federal war on drugs , and far fewer problems with drug addiction and related crimes was a consequence .
In the past 30 years , even with the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on the drug war , little good has come of it .
We have vacillated from efforts to stop the drugs at the source to severely punishing the users , yet nothing has improved .
This war has been behind most big government police powers of the last 30 years , with continual undermining of our civil liberties and personal privacy . "
The drug warriors are tied to the idea that criminal justice enforcement is the only solution to the problem .
This narrow and simplistic view fails to take into account the myriad situations under which drugs are taken by the American public .
What 's the difference between someone who unwinds and relaxes with a glass of wine or scotch and someone who unwinds and relaxes by smoking a little marijuana ?
According to federal estimates , 100,000 individuals die prematurely every year from alcohol .
Not a single human on record has ever died from a marijuana overdose , and drug deaths in general are far fewer in number than alcohol and tobacco deaths .
Yet that marijuana user , depending on where he resides , could be subject to harsh criminal sanctions .
Sensible education , harm reduction , and voluntary treatment for those who are truly addicted should be the policy .
Drug use and abuse has no place within the criminal justice system .
True drug abuse and addiction is a public health issue .
Those who use drugs recreationally , the same way millions of Americans drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes , should be of no concern to the government in a free society .
Our current policies fail to make any distinction between drug use and drug abuse , and that is a serious problem .
Under the leadership of a true compassionate conservative like Dr. Ron Paul , those suffering from drug addiction would get the help they need through non-coerced rehabilitation that seeks to help the individual get clean , not punish him for his addiction .
Getting clean of one 's addiction should be a personal choice .
It is not something the government has any right to force the individual to undergo .
We do n't force people in the U.S. to get mandatory treatment if they eat too much fast food , smoke too many cigarettes , drink too much alcohol , watch too much pornography , and so on , yet for some these are all addictions just as drugs are .
And , by every estimate , fully funding drug treatment and counseling programs across the nation for those who need them would cost far less than we dish out in tax dollars each year to feed , give medical care to , and house non-violent drug users .
The drug warriors claim that the establishment of so - called Drug Courts is a more appropriate method of dealing with drug issues .
The problem is that they are still operating from the premise that the use of drugs is a criminal justice matter .
Drug Courts are set up so that first and second offenders are kept out of the prison system .
This is simply an exercise in futility .
Drug Courts are not a solution because , again , they are coercive .
They grow bureaucracy further , prevent judges from hearing real cases that need to be adjudicated , and force participants to undergo mandatory drug testing .
As soon as the drug user fails a test , he lands right back in the prison system .
The drug warriors act as if most drugs are completely unsafe for consumption and never had a legitimate purpose .
Nothing could be farther from the truth .
Not only are many currently illegal drugs not as harmful as some like to claim , most had recognized medical and therapeutic uses before they were criminalized .
MDMA , the drug known recreationally as Ecstasy , is just one example .
MDMA was used for years by psychiatrists to help patients open up and discuss their feelings with greater ease .
Many individuals who experienced severe life trauma such as victims of sexual assault and abuse were finally able to face their emotions and deal with the pain of their past with the help of this drug .
Once MDMA caught on as a recreational drug taken at social gatherings , parties , and nightclubs across America , the government stepped in and had it designated a controlled substance with no recognized value .
Today , things have almost come full circle , with the federal government acknowledging that maybe it is useful after all .
Right now , FDA - approved studies are underway where researchers are administering MDMA to returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) to help them deal with their emotions and talk about the horrors they experienced .
The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies has a wealth of information on MDMA , including physicians who refute the inaccurate portrayal of MDMA painted by the federal government .
Marijuana is another recreational drug that has a legitimate place in medicine .
Medical marijuana is a hotly debated topic , as states across the nation move to lift restrictions on marijuana possession and consumption by those who are terminally ill or suffering from debilitating physical pain .
This is an issue that belongs within the states .
Ron Paul is one of the few candidates who has stated unequivocally that he will end all DEA raids on medical marijuana clinics and medical marijuana users .
Dr. Paul 's response to a medical marijuana patient in New Hampshire on November 9 , 2007 said it all :
There is nothing compassionate about rounding up people who are dying of cancer or AIDS and throwing them in prison .
Patients living in states where marijuana is legal should be free to exercise control over their own bodies .
DEA raids on medical marijuana users are a tremendous waste of federal tax dollars .
The drug warriors will claim that marijuana should not be allowed for pain relief and appetite stimulation , and that sick patients should be prescribed pharmaceutical drugs like Marinol instead .
This is a losing argument because it is simply replacing one drug with another .
And , let 's face it , if a doctor gives you six months to live , would you rather take more pills or would you prefer to relax on your couch and smoke a joint ?
The drug warriors have mastered the dissemination of false information to scare the public about drugs in America .
They argue that if decriminalization or legalization were to occur , drug use and violent crime would skyrocket .
However , just the opposite is true .
Those who do not use drugs to begin with will not start using them just because they are no longer criminalized .
Alcohol drinking levels were in fact much higher during alcohol prohibition than after the law was repealed and alcohol legalized .
If you tell someone they ca n’t do something , they are going to want to do it more .
Under our current system , crime , violence , and drugs go hand in hand .
As a result of drug criminalization , gang violence in America has skyrocketed as groups of individuals wage war with each other for territorial control of the lucrative drug trade .
Addicts on the street often commit robbery and other crimes in order to get the money needed to pay for the drugs they ’re hooked on .
The great economist and conservative thinker Milton Friedman pointed out that , in a free - market scenario , drugs that are now illegal would be easily affordable and obtainable without addicts inflicting harm on anyone else ’s person or property .
The day that U.S. politicians face reality and declare an end to the War on Drugs , the crime rate will plummet in a way the nation has never witnessed before .
The drug warriors want the public frightened at the thought of drugged drivers operating cars on the roads .
The only problem is that the drugged drivers are already there .
Millions of people drive each day on cold and flu medicines , anti-histamines , Prozac , Ritalin , and a host of other pharmaceuticals .
Is that somehow alright simply because a doctor wrote them the prescription or because they bought it off the supermarket shelf ?
According to a recent article in Slate , there is n’t much difference in terms of physical effects between an individual taking the pharmaceutical drug Ritalin and someone using Cocaine .
Both Ritalin and Cocaine produce the same effects in the body when ingested .
The only difference is that one is prescribed in droves by physicians and the other is considered a street drug .
As the author points out , this is because the pharmaceutical industry has developed a litany of substitutes for illegal drugs in order to treat depression , anxiety , and pain — real conditions that affect real people every day .
Anyone who believes that a drug free society is achievable is sadly fooling themselves .
When they denounce easing criminal sanctions on drugs here at home , the drug warriors disapprovingly point to European nations where they perceive drug laws to be more relaxed .
However , for the most part , the drug policies of most European nations are n't much more advanced than our own .
Places like Holland are often cited as being tolerant of drug use , yet most drugs other than marijuana are still illegal there .
Meanwhile , as Ron Paul has rightly decried , the federal government here in the U.S. has squandered enormous financial resources going after pain management doctors who prescribe drugs like OxyContin to individuals suffering from chronic , debilitating pain .
Here 's how Congressman Paul described the situation in a column he authored back in May of 2004 :
" When we talk about the federal war on drugs , most people conjure up visions of sinister South American drug cartels or violent urban street gangs .
The emerging face of the drug war , however , is not a gangster or a junkie :
It 's your friendly personal physician in a white coat .
Faced with their ongoing failure to curtail the illegal drug trade , federal drug agencies have found an easier target in ordinary doctors whose only crime is prescribing perfectly legal pain medication .
By applying federal statutes intended for drug dealers , federal prosecutors are waging a senseless and destructive war on doctors .
The real victims of the new campaign are not only doctors , but their patients as well . "
These bureaucrats do n’t know the first thing about healthcare or pain management , yet they profess to know better than a licensed medical doctor what amount of a drug is too much .
Physicians have been sentenced to decades behind bars for doing their best to make patients comfortable and help them cope with their conditions .
The drug warriors would have the public believe that the prisons are filled with violent criminals that need to be segregated from society .
Yet , according to the Sentencing Project , 60 percent of all Federal inmates are currently imprisoned on drug charges , and one - fifth of all state prisoners are serving time for drugs , a thirteen - fold increase since 1980 .
The overwhelming majority of these offenders are non-violent .
Not to mention , according to federal statistics , one - third of all federal inmates are illegal aliens who do n’t even belong in the U.S. to begin with , many of whom are imprisoned for drug smuggling .
Just imagine , if all those non-violent prisoners were removed from the system , we would have room to house the murderers , rapists , child molesters , and thieves who actually do belong behind bars , many of whom are currently released far too early because of overcrowded conditions .
The collateral damage from the War on Drugs has been astounding .
Hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent over the past 35 years trying to achieve the myth of a drug free society .
There is no such thing .
In the meantime , we have gutted the U.S. Constitution of our Founding Fathers in terms of civil liberties , privacy , and property rights .
We have allowed the increased use of deadly SWAT team raids , killing countless innocent bystanders .
AIDS and other diseases are rampant in prisons across the nation because of inmates who violently sexually assault one another .
Where is the compassion in subjecting non-violent individuals to behavior like that , simply because they are involved with drugs in some way ?
To top it all off , in the post 9/11 world , the U.S. can't afford to keep the War on Drugs going any longer .
Illegal drug sales fund international terrorism and provide rogue nations and terrorist groups with countless dollars to build their weapons programs and cause havoc throughout the international community .
The War on Drugs is not compassionate or conservative .
It is morally bankrupt , coercive , corrupt , and unconstitutional .
That 's right : Nowhere in the U.S. Constitution did the Founders give the government authority to wage war against the consumption of an arbitrary list of substances by the American public .
There is no excuse that can justify the needless lives lost and destroyed through this draconian public policy .
Alcohol prohibition was tried and proved to be a miserable failure .
It 's time once and for all to bring an end to America 's failed experiment with drug prohibition as well .
Conservatives are supposed to stand for the Constitution , liberty , and limited government interference in individual lives .
The War on Drugs is incompatible with a free society , and the fact that Ron Paul is the only conservative candidate running for the White House in 2008 to recognize that is troubling to say the least .
RESTON , Virginia ( CNN ) -- William
Kim still calls the cell phone of his son , a 21 - year - old senior at Virginia Tech , just to hear his voice .
He feels cheated out of a chance to save his only boy .
Daniel Kim , 21 , was a senior at Virginia Tech who had fallen into a deep depression after last year 's massacre .
His son , Daniel Kim , was n't a victim of last year 's massacre that left 32 students and professors dead .
His son committed suicide eight months later , after falling into a deep depression .
A Korean -American , Kim feared that classmates might mistake him for shooter Seung - Hui Cho .
" They treated it like some kind of joke , " William Kim said of the way the university handled his son 's warning signs .
In fact , one of Kim 's friends from another state had e-mailed the Virginia Tech health center with the subject line : " Emergency About Suicidal Student . "
" Daniel has been acting very suicidal recently , purchasing a $ 200 pistol and claiming he 'll go through with it , " said the e-mail from Shaun Pribush , who had become an online friend of Kim's .
" Once again , this is very serious ; this is not a joke . "
The e-mail was sent at 3:58 a.m. November 5 , 2007 .
Watch family say Kim feared people would think he looked like Cho »
University protocol states that a suicidal person needs to see the " psychologist on call , " but that never happened .
Instead , Virginia
Tech passed on the information to the Blacksburg police , who at 11:45 a.m. that day showed up at Kim 's doorstep for what police records show was a " welfare check , " what school officials call a " wellness check . "
" All they did was just knock on the door , and they got Dan , and that was pretty much it .
Thirty seconds later , the door was closed , " said Kim 's roommate Chris Crumpler .
Emergency E-mail Shaun Pribush sent this e-mail to Virginia Tech 's health center on November 5 , 2007 .
" Dear health center ,
This is a serious email , this is not a joke .
I am Shaun Pribush , a student at RPI , but I am e-mailing because me and some other individuals are very worried about our friend at Virginia Tech , Daniel Kim .
Daniel has been acting very suicidal recently , purchasing a $ 200 pistol , and claiming he 'll go through with it .
In one incident , he said on a Friday , he would do it after the weekend , but then told us he failed to go through with it .
On about November 2nd , Daniel told me and a friend over " Instant Messenger " that he just swallowed 22 pills and said this is the end and signed off , but on the morning of November 5th , he logged on saying " third time will be a charm i made myself puke up the pills when i was on the road and then ... couldnt shoot myself so then i was thinking about getting into a car accident then i got all depressed over that sh-t and slept in my car . ... "
We are very concerned for his safety and are unsure the next time he might attempt suicide or go through with it , please forward this to who can give him the best care .
Once again , this is very serious ; this is not a joke .
Please update me if you acknowledge this and take action so I know if I reached the right e-mail adress .
Thank you . "
Virginia
Tech stands by the way it handled Kim's case , even though he was never seen by the school 's on - call psychologist as its policy mandates .
" The appropriate measures were taken in his case , " said Zenobia Hikes , the vice president for student affairs .
Why was the case referred to police and not an on -campus psychologist ?
" Two - thirds of our students live off campus , and the protocol is for the police to go and do a wellness check if an individual lives off campus , " Hikes said .
Virginia
Tech later told CNN that Hikes was describing an unwritten policy for off - campus students .
Also in the wake of Kim 's suicide , the university says it is considering changing its policy for suicidal students so that a healthcare professional goes along with police on wellness checks .
" We followed the protocol for Daniel Kim in following all the procedures that we were scheduled to do based on ... information that we had in the e-mail , and we pursued the information in the e-mail , followed the protocol and acted appropriately , " Hikes said .
Police officers , who Blacksburg police say are trained do to wellness checks , visited two Daniel Kims living off campus after receiving the e-mail from Pribush .
CNN tracked down the other Daniel Kim .
In an e-mail , he wrote that officers did ask him about Pribush but said " they did n't seem very interested .
...
They did n't ask me if I was feeling depressed or suicidal . "
Blacksburg police repeatedly declined comment for this story .
Pribush , who recently graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York , had met Kim online in the " World of Warcraft " game .
In the months after the Virginia Tech massacre , Pribush said , he noticed a change in Kim .
" He was saying he was Asian , and he really did n't have too many friends in real life , " Pribush said .
Then , in late October , Kim revealed his darkest thoughts .
" He actually thought about purchasing a gun and planning to kill himself like soon .
I 'm like , ' Dan is that a joke ; is that something funny ?
I do n't think that 's funny .
You should n't joke about having a gun . '
He said , ' I 'm serious .
I actually bought a gun . ' "
Several days later , Kim threatened suicide again by " swallowing pills " and getting into a " car accident . "
Pribush became so concerned , he eventually e-mailed the Virginia Tech health officials .
Blacksburg police records show that they interviewed Kim and they classified him as " C - 4 , " which is the code for OK .
And then police drove off .
Three weeks later , Kim bought a pistol for $ 406.25 with his father 's credit card at JND Pawnbrokers , the same Blacksburg , Virginia , store where Cho picked up his gun .
William Kim said he had no idea about the purchase at the time .

Tech remembered
Then , on December 9 , more than a month after police checked on Kim , his sister , Jeannette , got an urgent call from home .
Something was wrong with her brother .
" So I texted him , and I was like ... ' Where are you ; I 'm really worried about you , ' " she said .
But it was too late .
Her brother shot himself in the family car in a parking lot seven miles from campus .
Today , his father still drives the car his son took his life in .
Asked whether the university let down his son , he said , " I feel like it , yes , especially after the April shooting . "
The dad says his son had not exhibited depression previously .
In addition , the father said , Virginia Tech never shared the emergency e-mail with him until it was too late .
That especially pains the family .
" Virginia Tech is lucky this time that only my brother died .
And to me , my brother was everything , " said his sister .

LONDON , Jan 14 ( Reuters ) - Gold surged to a historic high above $ 910 an ounce on Monday as investors rushed to buy the metal on further weakness in the dollar and expectations of a sharp cut in U.S. interest rates .
But the metal pared gains in afternoon European trade as some investors decided to take profits from a rally that saw prices jumping 50 percent in the past year , including a 15 percent rise in the last 30 days .
Gold ’s surge on the day also prompted buyers to snap up other precious metals , with platinum hitting a record high before giving up some gains .
Silver was quoted below a 27 - year peak , while palladium traded off its highest in two months .
“ It ’s human nature to buy into a market that is already showing strength .
Most fund managers have a herd mentality and they are just attracted to gains .
Gold could go higher still , but we do n’t think this is a right time for buying , ” said Robin Bhar , metals analyst at UBS Investment Bank .
“ From a technical perspective , we would obviously need to see a close above $ 900 that would be construed as a bullish sign .
But fundamentally , we are very cautious and would not advocate going long here because positioning is still extreme .
There is a risk of $ 50 - $ 100 dollar correction at any time . ”
Spot gold XAU= jumped as high as $ 914 an ounce before falling to $ 902.10/902.80 by New York 's last quote of 2:15 p.m. EST ( 1915 GMT ) , against $ 895.70/896.50 in New York late on Friday .
The most - active U.S. gold contract for February delivery at the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange GCG8 settled up $ 5.70 to $ 903.40 an ounce .
Japanese gold futures < O # JAU : > were closed for a holiday .
“ If you look at the overall situation , there is a lot of fear about more bad news related to the banking sector .
This is one of the main drivers at the moment , ” said Wolfgang Wrzesniok - Rossbach , head of sales at Germany ’s Heraeus .
“ There is some profit - taking from the metal ’s highs , but no big wave of selling is seen here .
Gold is trading in a normal range and is likely to hover in a wide band of $ 880 - $ 920 in the near term , ” he said .
The dollar dropped to the lowest level in seven weeks against the euro and yen on Monday as fears that weak U.S. corporate earnings will push the economy closer to a recession , requiring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates .
[ ID :nN14322154 ]
Interest rate futures are reflecting a 50/50 chance that the Fed could reduce its interest rate by three - quarters of a point between now and the Jan 29 - 30 meeting .
FEDWATCH
A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of other currencies and often lifts bullion demand .
Gold is also viewed as an alternative to holding the dollar , and thus the value of gold rises when the U.S. dollar falls .
SAFE HAVEN PLAY
“ Option sellers are covering their positions .
Also , hedgers are trying to undo forward sales after the $ 900 expected resistance was breached .
In overnight trade , funds overseas also reacted to dollar weakness and rumors of rate cuts , ” said George Gero , vice president of RBC Capital Markets Global Futures in New York .
Gero also noted a big open interest of gold futures of more than 500,000 lots .
Total open interest of COMEX gold futures eased 742 lots to a near - record 585,734 lots as of Friday , Reuters data showed .
< NYMMTLFUT/VOI >
“ Risk averse investors jumped on the bandwagon as the $ 900 resistance was surpassed , ” Gero said .
Gold ’s appeal as a safe - haven investment has increased due to worries of further write - downs among major financial institutions and credit market meltdown in the United States , the world ’s biggest economy .
On charts , gold ’s 14 - day relative strength indicator ( RSI ) rose to 89 from just 47 a month ago .
The market views an RSI of 30 or less as oversold and 70 or more as overbought .

Remember when conservatives used to use the word ' permissive ' a lot to describe liberal mores ?
I think you have to be ' of a certain age , ' as they say , to remember that time , but what the hell : I 'm just shy of 60 , and that certainly qualifies .
( Being imminently 60 does n't bother me in the least ; what gets me is that various events of importance in my life happened one hell of a long time ago .
But I digress . )
A lot of characteristics of left and right have flipped between the 1960s and now , of course .
Now there 's a lot more hard - headed realism on the left , and a lot more ivory - tower pseudointellectual bullshit on the right , for instance .
And permissiveness is one of these .
Of course , the ' permissiveness ' of the 1960s and 1970s was mostly about sex , which did n't really hurt anyone , but upset a lot of people anyway .
Conservative permissiveness is a whole ' nother story .
And today 's gun culture is Exhibit A .
The belief that people can and should carry their guns with them everywhere , that the ' castle doctrine ' does n't just apply to your house but to every inch of your property as well , that you should be able to stand your ground with firepower against any threat , even if you 've brought that threat into being by getting into people 's faces when any reasonably sensible person would have just walked on by ( and all of these things backed by relatively recent changes in the law in many states ) , seems to be leading to a rash of shootings that appear to have a common thread of : I have the right to shoot this person dead , so I will - often when I 'm in no danger at all .
Permissiveness .
With lethal consequences .
There are cases like where an Orlando homeowner shoots a guy who had been in his yard but fled , but the intrepid homeowner chased him over a fence and shot him to death on the grounds of a nearby apartment complex .
Or like where the white West Virginia homeowner saw a couple of black men try to get into what he thought - wrongly - was a shed on the corner of his lot , but actually was part of the property next door .
So he got out his gun , and shot and killed them both without warning .
One of the men killed had just moved in next door , and the other was his brother .
Or like the just - decided Michael Dunn case , where Dunn shot up a car full of black kids , killing one , continuing to shoot at them after they were trying to get the hell out of Dodge .
He seemed to think he had the right to pump them full of holes , as long as there was something he could hang a Stand Your Ground on .
Increasingly , gun lovers feel that they have the right , thanks to the expanded reach of pro-gun laws , to shoot to kill in certain situations .
Not because they 're in any danger , but just because .
On a message board I 've been hanging out at since the end of the last millenium , a poster mentioned an incident that happened to her sister and brother - in - law .
Some acquaintances of their teenage son heard that he had some nice gamer stuff , so they broke in while nobody was there , but were scared when some burglar alarms went off , got away with almost nothing , and were quickly apprehended .
Weeks later , the couple said at a family get - together that they wished they'd been there , so they could have shot the kids dead .
These worthless assholes were disappointed that they blew their chance to legally kill someone .
And that 's what it seems to be about : the hope that people like this have that the opportunity will come their way to blow someone away legally .
They 've changed the gun laws so that such opportunities are more abundant , and it 's given these people the impression that the gun laws are even more permissive than they are in this respect .
It 's a cultural thing .
A culture of permissiveness .
Permissiveness about blowing people away , ending their lives .
MONTGOMERY , Ala .  Donald Siegelman , former governor of Alabama , was ordered released from prison on Thursday by a federal appeals court , pending his appeal of a bribery conviction that Democrats say resulted from a politically driven prosecution .
In its order , the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit , in Atlanta , said Mr. Siegelman had raised “ substantial questions ” in his appeal of the case and could be released on bond from the federal prison in Oakdale , La. , where he has served nine months of a seven - year sentence .
The order did not say what those questions were , but his lawyers have argued for months that the bribery charge on which he was mainly convicted revolved around a transaction that differed little , if at all , from a standard political contribution .
Mr. Siegelman ’s lawyers maintained that  as is standard in many white - collar crime cases  the veteran Democratic politician never should have been imprisoned in the first place while he appealed his conviction .
“ He should not have been manacled and taken off in the night , ” said his lawyer , G. Robert Blakey , also a professor at the University of Notre Dame , citing the ex-governor ’s immediate imprisonment after his conviction , a point of contention for his supporters .

BARCELONA ( Reuters ) - Yahoo has displaced Google as preferred provider of Web services to mobile operator T - Mobile in northern and central Europe , Yahoo and T - Mobile said on Tuesday .
The deal , announced by the two companies at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , demonstrates Yahoo ’s momentum in mobile services worldwide in spite of the uncertainties raised by Microsoft ’s takeover bid .
T- Mobile had been Yahoo rival Google ’s breakthrough mobile partner .
Beyond the nearly 90 million phone customers that Yahoo stands to reach through T - Mobile , the deal , signed last Wednesday , shows Yahoo ’s mobile moves have not been hobbled by the possibility that Microsoft could become its parent .
Marco Boerries , the senior vice president in charge of Yahoo ’s mobile phone push , said the exclusive deal brings the number of subscribers covered by partnerships
Yahoo has struck with mobile carriers over the past year to more than half a billion potential phone customers .
“ We are now passing 600 million , ” Boerries said .
During 2008 , Yahoo plans to focus on joint marketing efforts with its carrier partners to convert these potential customers into regular users of Yahoo Internet services on their phones .
Financial terms were not disclosed .
The agreement takes effect at the end of March , when the previous T - Mobile deal with Google expires , T - Mobile and Yahoo said in a statement .
Eight months after the United Nations Security Council authorized sending a peacekeeping force to Darfur , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki Moon is warning that security and humanitarian conditions in the violence - torn western province of Sudan are going from bad to worse .
Urgent efforts are needed to further safeguard the population , improve access to emergency food supplies , and increase the airborne mobility of peacekeepers and humanitarian workers , say some Africa and aid experts .
Without them , they warn , a new disaster could occur this summer when annual rains arrive .
Worldwide protest campaigns aim to pressure the international community to take action on Darfur , But they have yielded mixed results , at best , in two key objectives : building the UN peacekeeping force and enlisting China to strong - arm Sudan , with which it has close commercial ties , to cooperate more fully on Darfur .
Noting that it has been four years since the Security Council took up Darfur , Secretary - General Ban said in a recent statement that " the situation remains grim today , as then , if not worse . "
According to Ban , some 15,000 humanitarian workers in the province are " keeping widespread mortality in Darfur below emergency thresholds . "
His spokeswoman on Darfur , Marie Okabe , says those workers are " having a really , really hard time " and face the same deteriorating conditions as the population .
Placing the number of internally displaced people in Darfur at 2.45 million and growing " at a rate of 1,000 per day , " Ban said there is " no accountability , or end , in sight " for violence that targets women and girls in particular .
The peacekeeping mission approved last summer is to be a hybrid force of as many as 26,000 UN and African Union military personnel and civilian police .
So far , 9,000 troops have been deployed to Darfur .
The Sudanese government of President Omar al - Bashir has resisted plans for some of the peacekeepers to come from outside Africa , but Ban says the government has given the green light to troops from Nepal and Thailand .
The US government – spurred by President Bush 's characterization of violence in Darfur that has killed more than 200,000 people as " genocide " – is calling on the UN to accelerate deployment of peacekeepers and to add at least 3,600 troops by June .
The US is not offering troops or helicopters – which the Khartoum government would probably not accept anyway – but pledges $ 500 million to help train , house , and supply the mission .
While it 's important to get more authorized military and police personnel into Darfur , say peacekeeping experts , it 's more crucial to train and prepare the troops going in and to ensure they 'll have the supplies and the mobility to do their jobs .
" For sure we need to have more troops on the ground , but it 's not as easy as simply snapping your fingers , " says one peacekeeping expert at the UN in New York who is not authorized to comment publicly on deployments .
" At least as important as the numbers are questions like , how prepared are they for the mission ?
Are they trained ?
Is the air power going to be there to get them around ? "
Mobility is key for peacekeepers and humanitarian workers .
With the June rains come impassable roads and stranded , displaced populations .
Those conditions might lead to an even bigger humanitarian challenge this summer , what Eric Reeves , a Darfur expert at Smith College , warns could be a " genocide by attrition . "
So far , no UN member has stepped forward to offer any of the two dozen tactical and transport helicopters authorized for the mission by the Security Council resolution , the advocacy group Africa Action noted recently .
Africa Action and other groups are calling on the US in particular to provide " international leadership " by pressing all parties involved in the Darfur crisis to accept and join a peace process , noting that the real answer lies in implementing a political accord among the government and rebel fighters .
Grass - roots efforts for more action from the international community , especially in getting consistent cooperation from the Bashir government , explain the mounting pressure on China .
Activists are playing on Beijing 's sensitivity to its image as it prepares to host the Olympic Games this summer .
Chinese officials counter that the pro-Darfur activists are exaggerating Beijing 's influence over Khartoum .
Los Angeles County officials Wednesday urged parents to avoid the increasingly popular practice of sleeping in the same bed as their infant children , calling the practice a “ potentially lethal act . ”
County statistics released Wednesday show that 44 infants died after they slept next to an adult in 2006 , a 76 % increase over the previous year .
It was the county ’s highest number of deaths ever associated with “ co- sleeping , ” the practice of sleeping in the same bed , couch or chair with an infant .
“ These are tiny infants , who , someone , perhaps well - intentioned , took to bed with them . . . and they wake up and the child is not breathing , ” said Deanne Tilton Durfee , director of the Los Angeles County Inter - Agency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect .
“ We know the value of holding your child , cuddling your child , loving your child .
But if you take the baby to bed with you and fall asleep , you are committing a potentially lethal act , ” she said .

The pronouncement was criticized by some who have promoted the benefits of parents sharing their bed with infant children , and say it ’s easier to breast - feed and console a crying infant .
“ New parents have to do what they have to do to get to sleep , ” said Karen Zeretzke , who has been a longtime leader with La Leche League International , which provides information and support to breast - feeding mothers .
The group does not have an official position on whether to recommend co-sleeping to mothers , “ but what we have found is that many mothers have found sleeping together facilitates breast - feeding , ” Zeretzke said .
Zeretzke said co-sleeping was essential in her household .

“ Bringing the babies to bed let the entire family sleep peacefully , ” she said .
The issue of co-sleeping has attracted controversy in recent years , as the practice has become more popular .
The American Academy of Pediatrics and researchers say that bed - sharing leaves babies vulnerable to being crushed or suffocated , and may increase their risk of sudden infant death syndrome .
The safest place for infants to sleep is in the same room as the mother , but in their own crib , bassinet or cradle , the organization says .
A policy statement to that effect was published in the November 2005 issue of the journal Pediatrics .

The statement pointed to one study showing that nearly half of 119 infants who died suddenly and unexpectedly during a four - year period in the St. Louis area did so while sleeping with someone else .
The organization ’s policy statement has generated controversy among some doctors .
The academy ’s breast - feeding panel wrote a letter to the journal Pediatrics saying bed - sharing under safe conditions may be important to breast - feeding .
Co-sleeping has become popular among some mothers who say the practice allows both mother and infant to sleep through feedings .
A survey of nearly 8,500 people found that 12.8 % of infants regularly shared an adult bed at night in 2000 , more than double the percentage in 1993 , according to a government study published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine .
Of those polled from 1993 through 2000 , nearly 45 % shared their beds with infants occasionally .

The practice also was highlighted in an article about Jennifer Lopez ’s newborn twins in the March 31 issue of People magazine , which said , “ Although the babies have ornate cribs , Jennifer and Marc often take them to bed . ”
Dr. Bob Sears , an Orange County pediatrician who co-wrote “ The Baby Sleep Book , ” said some co-sleeping can be unsafe , but disagreed with the blanket statement that the practice is unsafe all the time .
“ So many babies sleep so much better nestled up to a parent that many parents are doing it to get a better night ’s sleep , ” he said .
“ Parents are n’t going to stop doing it just because the government tells them what kind of parent they should be . ”
Los Angeles County officials say , however , that the practice has led to some tragedies .

Patricia Ploehn , director of the county Department of Children and Family Services , recalled a case in 2006 in which a father sitting on a chair fell asleep with his infant child sleeping on his chest ; he awoke to find that the infant had slipped in between the armrest and seat cushion and died .
“ It ’s just disturbing , ” she said .
“ It ’s broken the hearts of so many parents . ”
Some of the co-sleeping deaths were connected with parents who were under the influence of drugs , but others were not , Ploehn said .
“ In those first few weeks ” after a child is born , she said , “ they are exhausted . ”

Research suggests that children 's memory may be more reliable than adults ' in court cases
The U.S. legal system has long assumed that all testimony is not equally credible , that some witnesses are more reliable than others .
In tough cases with child witnesses , it assumes adult witnesses to be more reliable .
But what if the legal system had it wrong "
Researchers Valerie Reyna , human development professor , and Chuck Brainerd , human development and law school professor -- both from Cornell University - - argue that like the two - headed Roman god Janus , memory is of two minds -- that is , memories are captured and recorded separately and differently in two distinct parts of the mind .
They say children depend more heavily on a part of the mind that records , " what actually happened , " while adults depend more on another part of the mind that records , " the meaning of what happened . "
As a result , they say , adults are more susceptible to false memories , which can be extremely problematic in court cases .
Reyna 's and Brainerd 's research , funded by the National Science Foundation , Arlington , Va. , sparked more than 30 follow - up memory studies , many of them also funded by NSF .
The researchers review the follow - on studies in an upcoming issue of Psychological Bulletin .
Tis research shows that meaning - based memories are largely responsible for false memories , especially in adult witnesses .
Because the ability to extract meaning from experience develops slowly , children are less likely to produce these false memories than adults , and are more likely to give accurate testimony when properly questioned .
The finding is counterintuitive ; it does n't square with current legal tenets , and may have important implications for legal proceedings .
" Because children have fewer meaning - based experience records , they are less likely to form false memories , " says Reyna .
" But the law assumes children are more susceptible to false memories than adults . "
The court 's reliance on adult testimony has a long history .
Before the early 1970s , children younger than eight years old rarely testified , because they failed the court 's competency requirements .
Then in the 1970s , when statistics showed an increase in the number of child abuse cases , courts were forced to allow the testimony of young victims , only to reemphasize adult testimony in the 1990s , when some children 's testimony was proven to be unreliable .
" Courts give witness instructions to tell the truth and nothing but the truth , " says Brainerd .
" This assumes witnesses will either be truthful or lie , but there is a third possibility now being recognized -- false memories . "
According to Brainerd , " Things are about to change radically . "
Fuzzy Trace Theory
Traditional theories of memory assume a person 's memories are based on event reconstruction , especially after delays of a few days , weeks , or months .
However , Reyna and Brainerd 's Fuzzy Trace
Theory hypothesizes that people store two types of experience records or memories : verbatim traces and gist traces .
Verbatim traces are memories of what actually happened .
Gist traces are based on a person 's understanding of what happened , or what the event meant to him or her .
Gist traces stimulate false memories because they store impressions of what an event meant , which can be inconsistent with what actually happened .
False memories can be identified when witnesses accurately describe what they remember but those memories are proven false based on other unimpeachable facts .
" When gist traces are especially strong , they can produce phantom recollections -- that is , illusory , vivid recollections of things that did not happen , such as remembering a robber brandished a weapon and made threatening statements , " says Reyna .
Brainerd argues that because witness testimony is the primary evidence in criminal prosecutions , false memories are a dominant reason for convictions of innocent people .
Recently , in Cook County , Ill. , more than 200 murder confessions were identified as being based on adult 's false memory reports because they conflicted with unimpeachable facts .
For example , a person may have falsely remembered being in one location , but a sales receipt showed that he was in another location at the same time a crime was committed .
In child abuse cases where the law gives the benefit of the doubt to adult testimony , the results can be even more disconcerting .
" Failure to recognize differences in how adults and children produce memory unfairly tilts the U.S. legal system against child witnesses , " says Reyna .
" Children do not have the same fullness of emotional and intellectual experience as do adults when it comes to deriving meaning from situations , " says Reyna .
" So , meaning - based memory is less likely to influence a child 's testimony . "
The researchers say their transformative " two - mind " memory approach can reduce the number of false memories in court cases and give more validity to children 's testimony .
Memory Science
Reyna and Brainerd developed several mathematical models associated with Fuzzy Trace
Theory that can be used to predict memory outcomes in both adults and children .
The models , which test memory , have been used to determine ways in which attorneys , investigators , law enforcement officials and others can ask questions to help people access verbatim memories while suppressing false memories .
The researchers say using neutral prompts to cue witnesses can help them remember what actually happened .
Reyna and Brainerd also say returning a witness to the scene of an event in a highly neutral way can cue verbatim memories and help the legal process .
The models provide the most accurate information to date on the causes of false memories .
Using them , researchers can determine with surprising accuracy when a person accesses both verbatim and gist memory .

Reyna and Brainerd 's findings are summarized in a new book , The Science of False Memory , published by Oxford University Press .
The way a baby learns the word " bottle " is similar in some ways to how a dog learns words .
Marcy Maloy / Digital Vision Collection / Getty Images
When kids learn language , they start by associating sounds with objects or ideas .
For instance , if a child hears the word " bottle " every time the child is presented with a bottle , the child will eventually learn to connect the sound of the word with the object .
In this way , kids understand words before they learn to express them .
One could say the same thing happens with dogs .
Dogs just never make the next step to speak with words .
However , whether a dog's " understanding " of a word compares to a child 's understanding is another matter .
When a toddler learns a word , such as " pencil , " the child will associate the word with the concept of a writing instrument in a variety of ways ( even making the mistake of calling a pen a " pencil " after seeing someone write with it ) .
On the other hand , dogs probably learn the word " pen " as a sound that commands a response -- " bring me the pen and you 'll get a treat , " for example .

Because dogs most likely do n't understand abstract concepts , they can't understand the words that refer to abstract concepts .
For example , humans understand ideas like " love , " " hatred , " " beliefs " and " carelessness . "
These ideas do n't necessarily relate to a specific object or action .
Ideas that do refer to specific things are called concrete concepts .
So , when we tell dogs we love them , this probably does n't mean as much to them as the word " treat " does .
Some might say that until we find a way to interpret a dog's mind , we can't definitively say that dogs do n't understand abstract concepts .
As far we know right now , however , dogs are only capable of understanding words that refer to concrete things .
Can we say that a dog understands language ?
That depends on the definition of language , which is contested .
If language indicates the process of merely communicating a particular stimulus ( a word ) to produce a particular reaction , then dogs definitely understand language .
But for many linguists , people who study language , a proper definition of language must go deeper .
Some linguists think language necessitates sentences with syntax .
Syntax refers to the way words relate to each other in a sentence , based on a structured rule system , such as word order .
For instance , for English speakers , the sentence " the dog bites the man " means something different from " the man bites the dog , " even though both sentences incorporate the same words .
Under the umbrella of this stricter definition of language , dogs do n't understand language because there 's reason to believe they can't understand sentences in this way .
Even toddlers can distinguish between parts of speech such as verbs and nouns , while a dog probably can't [ source : Kaminski ] .
One might argue that if dogs can't use syntax like children can , then dogs can't truly understand a word because they do n't understand how it relates to other words .
But if dogs can't really comprehend language in the way humans do , why do they seem to understand us so deeply ?
Certain studies show that dogs pick up on human gestures and cues ( like Clever Hans did ) better than other animals , even great apes [ source : Hare ] .
So when dogs seem to understand our words , they might really just be reading our body language or tone of voice .
Regardless , dogs have an amazing ability to understand us .

When people think about the destruction and degradation of tropical forests , they tend to focus on rainforests .
Tropical dry forests tend to get overlooked .
They are n’t as striking - no cathedral - like understorey , no mind - boggling biodiversity .
But more importantly , they often just are n’t there .
Over much of their potential range they have simply been erased from the landscape .
They may have covered as much as 42 % of the land area in the tropics , but have been reduced to less than 27 % of their former range in Mexico , and as little as 2 % in Central Americaand New Caledonia
Despite this fact , tropical dry forests are often seen as being quite well - adapted to human disturbance .
Being less species - rich than wetter forests , they tend to support fewer rare species , and may be less extinction - prone .
In addition , dry forests are dominated by trees that sprout after being cut .
This means that if you cut down a patch of dry forest , most of the stumps will re-sprout .
This type of recovery is much quicker than you would get if the trees had to germinate from seeds - not only does it take much longer for seedlings to grow large ( stump sprouts can draw on resources stored in the roots of the tree ) , but there ’s likely to be a time lag as seeds disperse into the area from surviving trees ( tropical forests tend to lack long - lived seedbanks ) .
Much of our understanding of succession in tropical dry forests comes from Jack Ewel ’s dissertation work .
Ewel looked at the effect of cutting and herbicide application on succession in a series of plots across the Neotropics .
One of his important findings was the dry forests were quicker to recover their stature that wetter forests .
Since most of the recovery comes from stump sprouts , the recovering forest is also close to the original forest in terms of species composition .
While lightly used dry forest sites recover rapidly , recovery is slower in more intensively used sites .
Seedling survival rates are very low in dry forests - while seedlings establish in the wet season , most ( often all ) of them die in the subsequence dry season .
So while intensively used sites in Guánica Forest recovered well in terms of structure , biomass and leaf fall in 50 years after abandonment , the recovery of species composition was very slow6 .
Resilience is the rate of recovery of disturbed sites to their pre-disturbed state .
Ewel ’s work helped to establish the idea that dry forests are more resilient than wetter forests .
But there is no single rate - or pathway - of recovery .
Measures of “ recovery ” depend on the parameter measured - canopy height , biomass , species richness , nutrient cycling …
It also depends on the baseline against which recovery is measured : if the same site is measured before and after disturbance , you need to know if the site represented “ mature ” forest before disturbance .
If another site is used , you need to wonder if it is really representative of initial conditions in your experimental plot .
In a forthcoming paper7 in the journal Biotropica , Edwin Lebrija - Trejos and coauthors looked at what it really means to say that tropical dry forests are more resilient than wetter forests .
They looked at a sequence of 15 sites in Oaxaca , Mexico , which had been cultivated and then abandoned for 0 - 40 years , and compared them with nearby mature forest .
All of the sites had been cultivated for a short period ( 1 - 2 years ) and then abandoned without being converted to pasture8 .
They considered a variety of different ways to measure resilience - they looked at forest height , plant density , basal area ( the area occupied by tree stems ) , crown cover , species richness , species density ( number of species per 100 m2 ) , Shannon evenness and Shannon diversity .
Not surprisingly , they found that certain features ( canopy height , plant density , crown cover ) recovered rapidly ( in less than 20 years ) while others ( including basal area and species richness ) had not recovered after 40 years .
When compared their sites with other comparable studies , they found that their sites were among the quickest to recover canopy cover and height .
On the other hand , they found that their sites were among the slowest to recover species diversity and average in terms of the recovery of species richness .
Overall , in terms of the structural measures that Ewel focussed on , it ’s reasonable to conclude that dry forests are more resilient that wetter forests .
On the other hand , with regards to things like basal area and species richness , the assertion of resilience for dry forests is n’t well supported .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Two consumer groups asked the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday to create a “ do not track list ” that would allow computer users to bar advertisers from collecting information about them .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The Consumer Federation of America and the Consumers Union also urged the FTC to bar collection of health information and other sensitive data by companies that do business on the Internet unless a consumer consents .
The call echoed those of other privacy advocates who filed statements with the FTC on Internet companies ’ use of “ behavioral advertising . ”
That is the practice of tracking a computer user ’s activities online , including Web searches and sites visited , to target advertisements to the individual consumer .
In December , the FTC approved Google ’s purchase of advertising rival DoubleClick over the objections of some privacy groups .
At the same time , the agency urged advertisers to let computer users bar advertisers from collecting information on them , to provide “ reasonable security ” for any data and to collect data on health conditions or other sensitive issues only with the consumer ’s express consent .
In comments to the FTC on online behavioral advertising , advertisers made clear a strong preference for self - regulation rather than government dictates on how personal data are collected , what disclosures are made to computer users and how long the information is stored .
Consumer groups said on Tuesday they were skeptical of self - regulation .
“ Self - policing schemes are not enough to protect consumers ’ privacy and offer no enforcement against improper behavior , ” said Chris Murray , senior counsel for Consumers Union , in a statement .
“ While companies like Google are trying to put pretty good practices in place , we do n’t want to rely on the good graces of the companies because they might change their minds , ” he told Reuters in a telephone interview .
Several child advocacy groups , including the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and American Academy of Pediatrics , urged the FTC to bar advertisers from collecting information on or advertising to anyone under the age of 18 .
Several advertisers also questioned whether the FTC and privacy groups had established that any harm had been done by the data collected and pointed out that the advertisers subsidized the free information often sought on the Internet .
“ The associations ( of businesses and advertisers ) strongly believe that self - regulation and leading business practices comprise the most effective framework to protect consumers and further innovation in the area of privacy and behavioral advertising , ” the American Advertising Federation , Association of National Advertisers and other organizations said in a statement .
“ We believe that any additional principles or guidelines should be issued only after the commission specifically identifies harms and concerns so that business is in a position to consider and address them , ” the group said in its comments to the FTC .

We brought you Attorney General , Michael Mukasey 's tearful remarks about 9/11 and the ongoing FISA battle in Congress last week and on Tuesday 's Countdown , Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow dig deeper into what was either a series of lies from the AG or an admission of gross negligence on the part of the Bush Administration leading up to that tragic day .
Mukasey claimed that the U.S. received a phone call from a terrorist safe house in Afghanistan prior to 9/11 , but could n't trace the call because the FISA laws were too restrictive -- which is , of course , a lie .
Mukasey was a Federal Judge , he knows that .
Olbermann says that someone in the House or Senate needs to haul the Attorney General in and question him and find out whether he was lying to make a political point , or if the Bush administration really did receive such a call and chose not to act on it , leaving the country vulnerable to attack .
Maddow : " ... Oh please , just let him have just been lying , because if he was telling the truth here , if there really was a call from a known al Qaeda safe house in Afghanistan to the United States before 9/11 which the Bush Administration did not tap and trace ?
That is huge news and we ought to get some answers about why we were left so unprotected and surprised on 9/11 .
Let 's hope that he was just making that up . "
* On a side note , we would like to wish Rachel Maddow a very Happy Birthday !
“ I think for the most part the administration is doing the right thing in addressing the economic problems we have , ” said Representative Peter T. King , Republican of New York .
“ But I think tactically it would be better if the president himself was more out front , rather than leaving it so much to Paulson .
When there is a perceived national crisis , it ’s important for the president to be the point man . ”
Still , because the public has little faith in Mr. Bush , it may be tough for him to be the point man on the economy , even with a Harvard business degree .
Just 25 percent of the public approves of the way Mr. Bush is handling the economy , a figure even lower than his overall job approval rating , a CBS News Poll in mid-March found .
So it is no wonder , some Republicans say , that Mr. Bush is letting others do the talking .
“ The good news for Bush is he ’s got Paulson , who ’s got some real credibility on these issues , ” said John Feehery , a Republican strategist .
“ Paulson is doing a pretty good job of looking like he ’s doing something . ”
Other presidents have tried , with varying degrees of success , to use their platforms in tough economic times .
Franklin D. Roosevelt famously used his fireside chats to calm a nation traumatized by the Great Depression .
But Gerald R. Ford was ridiculed for his WIN buttons ( Whip Inflation Now ) , as was Jimmy Carter , with his call to set thermostats at 68 degrees .
Mr. Bush , by contrast , has been loath to sound downbeat .
He has yet to use the word “ recession , ” for instance .
Two months ago , he drew praise for bringing together Republicans and Democrats on an economic stimulus package including rebates for taxpayers .
( The checks will go out in May . )
But he has resisted calls from the House speaker , Nancy Pelosi , to hold a top - level bipartisan economic meeting to address the growing mortgage crisis .

As he said on Wall Street , Mr. Bush is not a fan of a government bailout for those who took risks in the marketplace .
BOSTON —
By now we all have a story about a job outsourced beyond our reach in the global economy .
My own favorite is about the California publisher who hired two reporters in India to cover the Pasadena city government .
Really .
There are times as well when the offshoring of jobs takes on a quite literal meaning .
When the labor we are talking about is , well , labor .
In the last few months we ’ve had a full nursery of international stories about surrogate mothers .
Hundreds of couples are crossing borders in search of lower - cost ways to fill the family business .
In turn , there ’s a new coterie of international workers who are gestating for a living .
Many of the stories about the globalization of baby production begin in India , where the government seems to regard this as , literally , a growth industry .
In the little town of Anand , dubbed “ The Cradle of the World , ” 45 women were recently on the books of a local clinic .
For the production and delivery of a child , they will earn $ 5,000 to $ 7,000 , a decade ’s worth of women ’s wages in rural India .
But even in America , some women , including Army wives , are supplementing their income by contracting out their wombs .
They have become surrogate mothers for wealthy couples from European countries that ban the practice .
This globalization of baby - making comes at the peculiar intersection of a high reproductive technology and a low - tech work force .
The biotech business was created in the same petri dish as Baby Louise , the first IVF [ in vitro fertilization ] baby .
But since then , we ’ve seen conception outsourced to egg donors and sperm donors .
We ’ve had motherhood divided into its parts from genetic mother to gestational mother to birth mother and now contract mother .
We ’ve also seen the growth of an international economy .
Frozen sperm is flown from one continent to another .
And patients have become medical tourists , searching for cheaper health care , whether it ’s a new hip in Thailand or an IVF treatment in South Africa that comes with a photo safari thrown in for the same price .
Why not then rent a foreign womb ?
I do n’t make light of infertility .
The primal desire to have a child underlies this multinational Creation Inc .
On one side , couples who choose surrogacy want a baby with at least half their own genes .
On the other side , surrogate mothers , who are rarely implanted with their own eggs any longer , can believe that the child they bear and deliver is not really theirs .
As one woman put it , “ We give them a baby and they give us much - needed money .
It ’s good for them and for us . ”
A surrogate in Anand used the money to buy a heart operation for her son .
Another raised a dowry for her daughter .
And before we talk about the “ exploitation ” of the pregnant woman , consider her alternative in Anand : a job crushing glass in a factory for $ 25 a month .
Nevertheless , there is — and there should be — something uncomfortable about a free - market approach to baby - making .
It ’s easier to accept surrogacy when it ’s a gift from one woman to another .
But we rarely see a rich woman become a surrogate for a poor family .
Indeed , in Third World countries , some women sign these contracts with a fingerprint because they are illiterate .
For that matter , we have not yet had stories about the contract workers for whom pregnancy was a dangerous occupation , but we will .
What obligation does a family that simply contracted for a child have to its birth mother ?
What control do — should — contractors have over the lives of their “ employees ” while incubating “ their ” children ?
What will we tell the offspring of this international trade ?
“ National boundaries are coming down , ” says bioethicist Lori Andrews , “ but we ca n’t stop human emotions .
We are expanding families and do n’t even have terms to deal with it . ”
It ’s the commercialism that is troubling .
Some things we cannot sell no matter how good “ the deal . ”
We cannot , for example , sell ourselves into slavery .
We can not sell our children .
But surrogacy business comes perilously close to both of these deals .
And international surrogacy tips the scales .
So , these borders we are crossing are not just geographic ones .
They are ethical ones .
Today the global economy sends everyone in search of the cheaper deal as if that were the single common good .
But in the biological search , humanity is sacrificed to the economy and the person becomes the product .
And , step by step , we come to a stunning place in our ancient creation story .
It ’s called the marketplace .

Transparent Frogs to Eliminate Need For Dissection
It would seem that Japan has decided to be a little more transparent with some of their scientific experiments .
Scientists at Hiroshima University ’s Institute for Amphibian Biology in Hiroshima , western Japan , have bred transparent frogs whose organs can be seen through their skin .
The lead researcher Masayuki Sumida , says researchers produced the creature from rare mutants of the Japanese brown frog , or Rena japonica .
“ You can see through the skin how organs grow , how cancer starts and develops .
The researcher can observe how toxins affect bones , livers and other organs at lower costs .
You can watch organs of the same frog over its entire life as you do n’t have to dissect it.â€ — Professor Sumida
Reducing the number of dissections in schools will eliminate a lot of controversy from animal rights groups concerned with humane treatment of laboratory animals .
It will also save schools money on the purchase of frogs to dissect .
The researchers also say that by fusing the genes of fluorescent proteins to the frog ’s genes , they can create frogs that glow .
Supposedly they would be able to see exactly when a cancer begins to develop as the frogs will actually begin to glow in the dark .
I can’t imagine any genetic engineering being on the horizon to breed transparent dogs or cats .
However , I bet lots of parents wish those hamsters and gerbils that occasionally get loose would glow in the dark .
Professor Sumida may start a side line product by producing glow - in - the - dark â€œlittle petsâ€ to pay for his research .

After further investigation of reports of Vista refusing to record NBC , we have found at least one case where a user receiving digital TV over - the - air has been blocked from recording TV shows .
Justin Sanders , who took this screenshot , says he was recording Raleigh 's HDTV channel WNCN - DT1 on his Vista machine when a popup stating that " restrictions set by the broadcaster ... prohibit recording of this program " appeared .
This is significant : this is the first case we 've heard of equipment voluntarily obeying broadcast flag - like restrictions on TV content digitally broadcast over - the - air .
The broadcast flag is a small piece of data broadcast alongside a digital TV program .
The ability to flag broadcast content was created by the ATSC standard which governs digital TV broadcasts in the United States .
By itself the broadcast flag cannot restrict use of broadcast content .
Instead , its force comes from a tech mandate law - an FCC regulation - which required manufacturers of DTV - receiving devices to detect and respond to " switched on " broadcast flags .
EFF and others opposed the use of the broadcast flag and fought successfully to have the FCC regulation overturned by the courts .
We did that because it handed control over your hardware to a remote authority , limited your right to your fair use of media , and would have made illegal open source products like MythTV .
As a result of that victory , manufacturers are not legally required to force their devices to detect and respond to the flag .
It would now appear that Microsoft has voluntarily chosen to obey such content restrictions in Vista , despite the successful work of thousands of users to defend Microsoft 's right to innovate and our right to fair use .
Justin was attempting to record the program on Windows Vista Ultimate using Silicon Dust 's HDHomeRun external tuner , which decodes the digital TV signal , and sends it over Ethernet to many types of digital TV receivers , such as MythTV or EyeTV .
As Silicon Dust says on its website , their decoder merely passes on the datastream , and does not interpret data like the broadcast flag field itself , so we know that it is Windows alone that has declared that this program should not be recorded .
To be perfectly clear : Microsoft is under no legal obligation to look for and respond in any particular way when it sees the broadcast flag being sent by NBC 's digital stations .
Any DTV - receiving software technology or device - like MythTV - is free to take the same stream from HDHomeRun and ignore a broadcast flag transmitted with it .
In other words Microsoft did not have to build its PC to look for and refuse to record a program which has its flag turned on .
Had consumers not stood up against the FCC'S mandatory flag rule three years ago , alternatives like MythTV would no longer be available .
Back then , the FCC tried to force tech companies ( and open source developers ) to obey the entertainment industry 's remote TV control .
A coalition of librarians , public interest organizations , and consumer groups successfully challenged the FCC 's jurisdiction to impose such a broad regulation in Federal court .
After the rightsholders lost in court , they spent millions lobbying Congress to pass a law forcing receivers to obey their command .
Your letters and calls stopped that bill .
So why , after all that work , does Microsoft 's software appear to honor content restriction ?
It 's hard to say .
Was it a content licensing requirement ?
Microsoft did n't have to do so if it just wanted its devices to decode and display over - the - air digital NBC broadcasts -- just as you do n't need to sign a contract in order to decode and display the signals sent over the public airwaves into your living room .
American consumers can choose what to do with their digital broadcast TV , just as they have been able with analog broadcast TV .
Perhaps it was an unintended mistake by Microsoft caused by the extensive DRM systems Vista has in place elsewhere .
Perhaps Vista has been confused into thinking this open NBC datastream is a restricted CableCard feed , which can ( and does ) block recording .
Or perhaps it it part of Vista 's system for obeying CGMS - A , another copy control system that Microsoft voluntarily agreed to implement .
If it 's a technical problem , Microsoft should confess , and fix it as soon as possible , before many more digital TV viewers are inconvenienced ( and users switch to less encumbered devices in droves ) .
If , however , it is a deliberate " feature " , they have some explaining to do .
That would amount to putting the desires of content holders above the best interests of its customers .
Even worse , it would mean they kept the deal silent while they marketed their broken hardware to those same unsuspecting customers .
We 're now working with Silicon Dust to try to replicate the circumstances in which Vista failed to record , and to do further analysis .
We 'll keep you updated on what we learn .
How can the national security classification and declassification system be fixed ?
That depends on how one defines the problem that needs fixing .
To the authors of a new report from the Public Interest Declassification Board ( PIDB ) , the outstanding problem is the difficulty of managing the expanding volume of classified information and declassifying a growing backlog of records .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The FBI has begun a criminal inquiry into the largest U.S. mortgage lender , Countrywide Financial Corp , for suspected securities fraud as part of investigations into the mortgage crisis , The New York Times reported on Sunday .
The Countrywide bank is seen in Lakewood , Colorado September 11 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Rick Wilking
Citing unnamed government officials with knowledge of the case , the Times said the investigation into whether Countrywide misrepresented its financial condition and the soundness of its loans in securities filings was at an early stage and it was not clear if any charges would result .
A Countrywide spokeswoman , Susan Martin , told the newspaper that “ we are not aware of any such investigation . ”
The probe was first reported on Saturday in The Wall Street Journal .
The Countrywide inquiry follows a broader investigation by the FBI into 14 companies as part of a review of the practices of the mortgage industry , the Times said .
A spokeswoman for the FBI declined to comment .
Investigators had been looking at possible accounting fraud or insider trading connected to loans made to borrowers with subprime credit , the Times said .
Countrywide already faces federal and state investigations of its lending practices , as well as several lawsuits by investors and mortgage holders .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting about three dozen civil investigations into how subprime loans were made and how securities were valued , the Times said .
State investigations include one by the Illinois attorney general , who earlier this month subpoenaed units of Countrywide Financial and Wells Fargo &
Co in a probe of whether the companies violated federal lending and civil rights laws by steering minority borrowers into more expensive loans .
In that probe , Countrywide said it would fully cooperate with authorities .
Countrywide , drowning in a pool of bad home loans , is in the process of being acquired by Bank of America for about $ 4 billion .
It reported a loss of about $ 422 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. drivers could enjoy a drop of up to 50 cents per gallon in gasoline prices by this spring as high fuel prices and the threat of a recession force them to conserve , experts said on Wednesday .
U.S. gasoline supplies hit a near - 14 - year high of 227.5 million barrels last week , helped by falling demand for the fuel , the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday .
“ Gasoline stocks are continuing to increase and it implies that people are probably cutting down on gasoline consumption -- a result of the weakening economy , ” said Phil Flynn , an analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago .
U.S. gasoline demand over the last four weeks only averaged about 1 percent more than the same period last year , the EIA said .
Demand growth for the fuel has typically averaged about 1.5 to 2 percent a year and has been one of the major drivers of global oil markets .
“ Something dramatic is occurring with consumer driving habits , ” Geoff Sundstrom , a spokesman for AAA motor club , said in a telephone interview .
“ These numbers , if sustained over next couple of weeks , should set the stage for a reversal of price forecasts . ”
He said U.S. gasoline prices in the spring could fall 50 cents a gallon from Wednesday ’s $ 2.98 .
Spring gasoline prices in the world ’s largest energy consumer set the stage for fuel prices during the summer months when vacationers drive fuel demand to annual peaks .
FORECASTS
In December , when oil prices were trading closer to a record $ 100 a barrel , compared with Wednesday ’s level of $ 87 a barrel , AAA predicted spring gasoline prices could hit a new record high above $ 3.50 per gallon , with fuel in some regions of the country hitting above $ 4.00 .
The EIA had forecast similar spring gasoline prices .
On Wednesday , EIA analyst Doug MacIntyre warned that unexpected maintenance or economic run cuts at oil refineries could spike gasoline prices at any time , especially since U.S. refineries last week were only running at 84.3 percent of capacity .
Even so , he said he “ certainly ” expects that his agency next month will publish lower spring gasoline price forecasts .
Sundstrom said drivers are buying less gasoline because they feel the pinch from high fuel prices that have clung to near $ 3.00 a gallon and fear a recession amid the housing downturn .
“ High gasoline prices by themselves have never altered consumer driving habits , ” he said .
“ Only when combined with some other factor have they fallen .
In this case , it ’s anxiety about a recession . ”
He said gasoline demand may have fallen because businesses are making fewer sales calls and short haul deliveries , while consumers may have curtailed some shopping trips .
The record average price for gasoline , nearly $ 3.23 a gallon , was hit on May 24 last year , according to AAA .
What a mess .
Apparently the Diebold opscans in NH have been so prone
to failure that the vendor , LHS Associates , was making countless quiet
" house calls " just before the primary up there .
This is not unusual : LHS
is called in routinely , and not just in New Hampshire ( the company
operates throughout New England ) , " to step in to make voting problems
disappear before elections . "
Whether there was fraud up there or not ( and real experts are still studying
the data ) , this situation is completely unacceptable .
So why is there no
coverage of this issue ?
Here Dori Smith , a radio reporter in Connecticut
( where she first discovered this disturbing trend statewide ) , reports what
she learned from some town clerks in the Granite State .

Voting Machine Failures During
the 2008 Presidential Primary Race
By Dori Smith
Very early research reveals that chronic problems continue with Diebold 's AccuVote Optical Scan voting machines in New Hampshire .
I made six calls to New Hampshire town officials and in four instances there were reports of voting machine problems .
The two other calls turned out to have been to areas where electronic voting is not in use and hand counts were done .
A state wide study would likely reveal that the voting machines failed many times during the 2008 presidential Primary .
The vendor , LHS Associates of Methuen MA , is relied on heavily by town officials in New Hampshire .
Town officials trust them and their representatives tend to step in to make voting machine problems disappear during elections .
They are like copy machine repair staff in a frantic law office .
Little would move without them .
If a statewide recount of New Hampshire scheduled January 16th goes ahead as planned any irregularities found could be cross referenced to towns where machines failed .
However , first voting machine failures would have to be compiled .
Such data combined with a top down investigation into the performance of all electronic voting machines in general could make the 2008 Presidential Election far more secure .
Of interest would be the number of times the voting machines were repaired , replaced , or in any way handled by town officials or LHS Associates of Methuen MA .
Last minute repairs made to voting machines in advance of elections or mid election repairs are prime times for vulnerability to fraud .
Officials I spoke with were unclear that LHS was working under strict written security protocols other than those the clerks and other officials would have about set up and handling .
That would include the fact that town officials would hold the keys , open machines for LHS staff members when they arrive to make repairs , and break the seals .
Computer scientists we spoke with in Connecticut such as Professor Michael Fischer of Yale University 's Computer Science Department and Professor Alex Shvartsman of the University of Connecticut 's Voting Research Team , recommend tight written legal protections governing the way voting machine failures are handled .
Connecticut officials continue to work on problems that have arisen since they purchased the AccuVote Optical Scan machines in 2006 .
My interviews with New Hampshire officials revealed a consistent lack of concern about security protocols that would restrict a vendor from coming in to replace parts or repair machines during all phases of elections .
When I asked Rochester Clerk of the Election Cheryl Eisenberg to go over the voting machine security protocols that would apply to LHS staffers she said , " I do n't think there is anything in writing as to how the situation would be handled .
We rely on them , we trust them " .
Her remark typifies the way Town Clerks described their relationship with LHS during initial interviews .
The first six calls made revealed problems in four New Hampshire towns , Hanover , Exeter , Nashua and Manchester .
The two other towns I phoned that day , Springfield and Bradford , were not using electronic voting machines .
Overview of trouble reports :
Betsy McClain , Deputy Town Clerk in Hanover New Hampshire , reported that their machine broke down during the election and LHS Associates came out to make repairs .
This same machine had just been repaired by LHS for the same problem which was that a deflector or visor that guides votes into a bin for write ins versus regularly marked ballots was malfunctioning .
The write ins were being directed into the regular vote bin .
The LHS staffer reached into the machine and connected a cable .
Linda Hartson , Town Clerk of Exeter New Hampshire , also reported that LHS Associates came out and fixed the deflector or visor inside the mechanism during the primary race January 8th .
This was again the deflector or visor that guides votes with write ins to one bin and regularly marked ballots to another bin .
Paul Bergeron , Clerk of the Election in Nashua New Hampshire oversees elections in 9 wards .
He said he did have a bad memory card on set up and testing and he burned a new one and provided it to one of the wards .
He did so under direction of LHS with their software on his laptop .
Trisha Piecuch , Town Clerk of Manchester New Hampshire , said she oversaw all of the phases of elections including set up and testing and the election itself .
She said they had one memory card failure in Ward 3 and they used their back up card on hand to burn a new one for that ward under the supervision of LHS .
Also , one week prior to the primary race there was a problem with one of Manchester 's AccuVote machines and an LHS Associates employee named Tina came out to repair it .
She replaced a " chip and a reader " according to Piecuch .
" I 'm not sure what chip it is , " she said .
" It 's the chip that will I 'd say accepts the codes and everything like that .
So they [ LHS} again err on the side of caution and where it looked like it was a reader problem they decided to be safe and replace both because they did n't want us having any problems " .
In some areas where town officials are not equipped to burn or code their own back up cards , the Town Clerks indicated that if memory cards failed during the election they would call LHS to come and change the card .
This is consistent with what LHS staff members have told me about their routine practice where memory cards fail .
Yet , when I contacted Jim Kennedy , New Hampshire 's Deputy Attorney General , to find out more he indicated that LHS would not make card switches in New Hampshire during elections .
He said there are clear protocols for setting up machines and storing them having to do with seals and so on but he knew of no specific written security protocols that would apply to LHS .
He said I should ask moderators and the Secretary of the State for further information .

There are many tips that help increase your car 's mpg .
Hypermiling has been covered , but includes some extreme driving that turns many people off .
I also mentioned a few in a previous article , gas efficient driving , that included things like removing items from your trunk , inflating your tires , and keeping your engine in good condition with regular maintenance .
But out of all the suggestions , there was only one thing that skyrocketed the mileage on my 2001 Civic from 32 to 47 mpg .
All I did was slow down .
I know that 's a tall order for our fast - foward - instant - gratification lifestyle .
But imagine getting an extra 15 miles per gallon ( that 's at least an extra 200 miles per tank ) .
With current gas prices and our slowing economy , it just might be worth taking it easy on the gas pedal .
What exactly do I mean by slowing down ?
First , let 's talk about highway speeds .
In a typical family sedan , every 10 miles per hour you drive over 60 is like the price of gasoline going up about 54 cents a gallon .
That figure will be even higher for less fuel - efficient vehicles that go fewer miles on a gallon to start with .
- CNNMoney.com
That is based on a $ 3.25 price per gallon .
In response to the oil crisis in 1973 , a 55 mph national speed limit was imposed .
55 mph is still a car 's " sweet spot " for fuel efficiency .
What uses the most energy of a car at high speeds is the force of air .
The increase in wind resistance is exponential , which means it rises more steeply between 70 and 80 mph than 50 to 60 .
That 's why the mpg graph looks like this ( from fueleconomy.gov ) .
I know we 're all busy and we 've all got places to go .
But stop and consider just how much time you 're saving by driving faster .
If you need to go 30 miles , driving at 60 mph will get you there in 30 minutes .
Whereas driving 75 mph will get you there a whole six minutes earlier .
On top of that , you used up way more gas for going the same distance !
Increasing your highway cruising speed from 55 mph ( 90 km / h ) to 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) can raise fuel consumption as much as 20 % .
- eartheasy.com
What is six minutes worth to you ?
In addition to slowing down on the highway , you can raise your mpg on city streets by doing the same thing .
I do n't mean driving 10 - 20 mph , but anticipating stops by taking your foot off the gas pedal to slow down .
What uses the most gas when driving on city streets is accelerating .
By coasting ( taking your foot off the gas and letting your car 's momentum move it forward ) to a stoplight instead of driving right up to it and then slamming on the brakes does two things .
First , the light may turn green by the time you get there , so you would be accelerating from a coast than from a full stop .
Second , you 've already used up gas by accelerating to your current speed .
If you coast to a stop , the gas the engine already ate up got you further than if you continue to make your engine burn gas just to have that momentum cut short by braking .
Going further with less gas is the essence of fuel economy .
It takes a bit of getting used to , because everyone else seems to be zooming by .
But if you pay attention , you 'll realize that the guy who stepped on the gas just to get around you ended up stopped at the red light that you coasted up to .
And if you 're usually the guy who weaves in and out of lanes to get past slow cars , you probably never noticed those same cars were still right behind you a few miles later .
Increasing your mpg not only saves money on gas , it lowers our country 's demand on oil .
If you do n't want to give up your SUV , at least make it go further on less gas .
So give it shot .
You 've only got a few minutes to lose .

Update :
An anonymous Klingon in our message board adds this :
I am one of the Klingons in the photo ( tall one back row far right ) .
This event was not presented to our Klingon ( KAG ) group as a challenge .
The challenge was between the STAR TREK club , and not the Klingon club .
The OP of the ad made this up .
The challenge was never accepted because it was never offered .
While this event WILL PROBABLY happen in the future , it will not happen this Saturday .
No Klingons are available on such short notice , and many of our best bowlers are off - world ( cough ) doing , um , Klingon stuff .

U.S. Air Force Gen. Gene Renuart , left , commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command , and Canadian Air Force Lt. - Gen. Marc Dumais , commander of Canada Command , sign the so - called Civil Assistance Plan at U.S. Army North headquarters , Fort Sam Houston , Texas , Feb. 14 , 2008 .
On February 14 , at the U.S. Army North headquarters , Fort Sam Houston , Texas , U.S. Air Force Gen. Gene Renuart , commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command , and Canadian Air Force Lt. - Gen. Marc Dumais , commander of Canada Command , signed “ a Civil Assistance Plan that allows the military from one nation to support the armed forces of the other nation during a civil emergency , ” according to the USNORTHCOM website .
Billed as a “ bilateral military plan ” to align U.S. and Canadian “ national military plans to respond quickly to … requests for military support of civil authorities , ” the plan represents nothing short of a merging of national military infrastructures under the aegis of the North American Union .
Last October , USNORTHCOM General Victor E. Renaurt made public the Vision 2020 document outlining “ strategic goals for both NORAD and USNORTHCOM leading up to the year 2020 .
The document advocates strengthening relations with Canada Command , developing a closer relationship with Mexico ’s armed forces and establishing an effective continental defense against assorted threats , ” writes Lee Rogers for the Rogue Government website .
“ The focus of the Vision 2020 document is on protecting the continental perimeter of North America and not the United States .
Even more disturbing is that the document also outlines goals to provide timely and effective support for civil authorities in the wake of catastrophic events through the integration of USNORTHCOM ’s resources .
Essentially , they are envisioning the role of USNORTHCOM by 2020 to serve as a North American martial law apparatus that will have operational integration with current civil and military authorities in Canada , Mexico and the United States . ”
Although the agreement was essentially ignored by the corporate media in the United States , it was mentioned by the Canadian Canwest News Service , a media behemoth owned by the notorious neocon and convicted criminal Conrad Black , who enjoys a life peerage in the British House of Lords .
“ Canada and the U.S. have signed an agreement that paves the way for the militaries from either nation to send troops across each other ’s borders during an emergency , but some are questioning why the Harper government has kept silent on the deal , ” writes David Pugliese for Canwest .
“ Neither the Canadian government nor the Canadian Forces announced the new agreement , which was signed Feb. 14 in Texas . ”
However , the “ U.S. military ’s Northern Command … publicized the agreement with a statement outlining how its top officer , Gen. Gene Renuart , and Canadian Lt. - Gen. Marc Dumais , head of Canada Command , signed the plan , which allows the military from one nation to support the armed forces of the other nation during a civil emergency . ”
As should be expected , Mr. Pugliese minimized this egregious violation of national sovereignty by stating that few are alarmed , except for the “ left - leaning Council of Canadians ” and “ the right wing in the U.S. , ” that is to say people who are fully cognizant and understand what the so - called agreement , not signed by Congress or Canada ’s Parliament , means for the future of each country , soon enough to be effectively one country , along with Mexico , under the auspices of the globalist North American Union .
On right - wing blogs in the U.S. it is being used as evidence of a plan for a “ North American union ” where foreign troops , not bound by U.S. laws , could be used by the American federal government to override local authorities .
“ Co-operative militaries on Home Soil ! ” notes one website .
“ The next time your town has a ‘ national emergency , ’ do n’t be surprised if Canadian soldiers respond .
And remember — Canadian military are n’t bound by posse comitatus . ”
Posse comitatus is a U.S. law that prohibits the use of federal troops from conducting law enforcement duties on domestic soil unless approved by Congress .
The the John Warner Defense Appropriation Act , signed into law in 2006 , all but killed Posse Comitatus .
As noted by Senator Patrick Leahy and others , Section 1076 of the bill effectively nullifies the Posse Comitatus Act and the Insurrection Act ( 10 U.S.C. 331-335 ) and gives the decider - commander the ability to define under what conditions martial law may be declared .

In addition , Bush urged Congress to revise federal laws so that the U.S. military could seize control immediately in the aftermath of a natural disaster or , for that matter , following the next engineered al - CIA - duh attack .
As Frank Morales notes , the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and “ the equally odious Military Commissions Act of 2006 ” complement one another , as one “ allows for torture and detention abroad , while the other seeks to enforce acquiescence at home , preparing to order the military onto the streets of America . ”
Morales continues :
Make no mistake about it : the de-facto repeal of the Posse Comitatus Act ( PCA ) is an ominous assault on American democratic tradition and jurisprudence .
The 1878 Act , which reads , “ Whoever , except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress , willfully uses any part of the Army or Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both , ” is the only U.S. criminal statute that outlaws military operations directed against the American people under the cover of ‘ law enforcement . ’
As such , it has been the best protection we ’ve had against the power - hungry intentions of an unscrupulous and reckless executive , an executive intent on using force to enforce its will .
On February 4 , Lewis Seiler and Dan Hamburg , writing for the San Francisco Chronicle , detailed the enormous power now vested in the executive , from the aforementioned Military Commissions Act of 2006 to National Security Presidential Directive 51 ( NSPD - 51 ) , the latter under COG , or Continuity of Government .
Soon enough , all of this will dovetail with Jane Harman ’s Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ( HR1955 ) , “ which passed the House by the lopsided vote of 404 - 6 ” and “ would set up a commission to ‘ examine and report upon the facts and causes ’ of so - called violent radicalism and extremist ideology , then make legislative recommendations on combatting it , ” write Seiler and Hamburg .
“ According to commentary in the Baltimore Sun , Rep. Harman and her colleagues from both sides of the aisle believe the country faces a native brand of terrorism , and needs a commission with sweeping investigative power to combat it . ”
( For more on this , see Hamburg ’s interview with Alex Jones . )
“ Clearly , the U.S. government is ratcheting up their plans for martial law and using the phony threat of homegrown terrorism as an excuse to implement their militarized police state agenda , ” notes Lee Rogers .
“ There is no question that the U.S. government is preparing for martial law domestically , but the long term goal is to establish a martial law apparatus for North America .
They are merely beginning the implementation of what has been announced in the Vision 2020 document .
There is little question that this deal between USNORTHCOM and CANADACOM is another step towards forming a North American Union that is ruled by a militarized police state . ”
It should be obvious by now that the effective merging of U.S. and Canadian military establishments — landmarked by the signing of the Orwellian titled “ Civil Assistance Plan ” – essentially below the radar of the corporate media has little to nothing to do with “ floods , forest fires , hurricanes , earthquakes and effects of a terrorist attack , in order to save lives , prevent human suffering and mitigate damage to property , ” and everything to do with imposing a police state on the people of North America , a plan long envisaged by our globalist rulers , who are determined to reduce the planet to a sprawling slave gulag based on the China model that will be enforced by a brutal scientific dictatorship .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
House Democratic leaders unveiled legislation Tuesday to update the nation 's wiretapping program , rejecting a Senate - passed version of the bill that would give telecommunications companies legal immunity for agreeing to participate in the program after the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
President Bush secretly instituted the National Security Agency 's domestic spying program after 9/11 .
President Bush and House Republicans have insisted that the House pass the Senate version of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) bill .
Instead , top Democrats -- including House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , House Intelligence Chairman Silvestre Reyes and Judiciary Chairman John Conyers -- proposed that lawsuits against the phone companies could move forward through U.S. district courts .
The government has effectively frozen all litigation by invoking the " state secrets " doctrine , arguing that documents detailing the phone companies ' activities are classified .
Under the proposed legislation , the companies would be able to argue their cases in court and present classified evidence to a judge during a closed proceeding without the presence of the plaintiffs .
" We are not going to cave in to a retroactive immunity situation , " Conyers said .
He argued that " there 's no law school example in our memory that gives retroactive immunity for something you do n't know what you are giving it for .
It just does n't work in the real world , or on the Hill either . "
Texas Rep. Lamar Smith , the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , said that without immunity for telephone companies , the Democrats ' surveillance bill would be " dead on arrival . "
" Today 's proposal is further evidence that House Democrats are not only out of touch with the needs of the American people , but also with Senate Democrats , the White House and our intelligence community , " he said in a written statement .
" Their careless disregard for the concerns of our intelligence community simply proves the point that Democrats are weak on national security . "
A joint statement from the Department of Justice and the office of the director of national intelligence said that based on initial reports , " We are concerned that the proposal would not provide the intelligence community the critical tools needed to protect the country . "
The statement also restates the administration 's position that immunity protection is needed so the program can continue .
" Exposing the private sector to continued litigation for assisting in efforts to defend the country understandably makes the private sector much more reluctant to cooperate .
Without their cooperation , our efforts to protect the country cannot succeed , " it said .
Hoyer said the proposal sets up a new process for civil lawsuits , similar to one used in criminal cases , which " provides for the use of such secret documents in secret , not to be exposed , in secret by the courts as they do on a number occasions so that they can properly make their cases . "
Conyers said there would be " no hammer " forcing judges to hear the cases with the process , but he said the proposal " takes it out of FISA , takes it out of Congress , puts it in the court system and ... the telecoms have their day in court . "
Facing a certain veto from Bush , Conyers said , " This is our best way to resolve this matter , notwithstanding the president 's threat .
This is a reasonable , intelligent way to proceed without jeopardizing our responsibilities to fight terrorism . "
The House version provides stronger court oversight of government surveillance than the Senate bill .
It also adds a bipartisan commission modeled on the 9/11 commission to investigate the administration 's warrantless wiretapping program .
The commission would have subpoena power and would report back to Congress in one year .
Hoyer said the House will vote on the bill Thursday .
The Democrats ' chief vote counter , Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina , said he is confident the bill will pass the House .
But the measure is unlikely to get through the Senate .
Republicans object to any changes to the Senate bill , and the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee , Jay Rockefeller , of West Virginia , released a statement saying the House bill is a " step in the right direction .
But considerable work remains . "

Trading population for productivity
Oded Galor , Andrew Mountford
The last 200 years saw a ‘ Great Divergence ’ in per capita income , as some countries industrialised while others remained less developed .
This column attributes the divergence to international trade .
Comparative advantage encouraged industrialising economies to invest in human capital , while non-industrial economies experienced population growth .
The past two centuries have not only seen a ` Great Divergence ’ in the levels of income per capita across countries ; they have also witnessed a dramatic change in the distribution of population across the globe .
In the time period 1820 - 1998 , the ratio between income per capita in Western Europe and Asia grew nearly three - fold , whereas the ratio between the Asian population and the Western European population grew nearly two - fold ( Maddison 2001 ) .
This striking contrast between the development paths of large subsets of the world economy gives rise to fundamental questions about the growth process and its implications for current and historical development patterns .
Notably , has the pace of transition to sustained economic growth in advanced economies adversely affected the process of development in less - developed economies ?
Have the forces of international trade contributed to the divergence in the timing of the demographic transition and the emergence of sustained economic growth across countries ?
The origin of the ` Great Divergence ' in income per capita ( Pritchett 1997 ) has been the subject of an intense debate , with notable advocates for the importance of geographical and institutional factors , human capital formation , ethnic , linguistic and religious fractionalisation , colonialism and globalisation .
1
In recent research , we suggest that international trade has played a significant role in the differential timing and pace of the demographic transitions across countries and has been a major determinant of the distribution of world population as well as the ` Great Divergence ' in income per capita across countries .
2
International trade has an asymmetrical effect on the evolution of industrial and non-industrial economies :
While in the industrial nations the gains from trade have been directed primarily towards investment in education and growth in output per capita , a greater portion of the gains from trade in non-industrial nations has been channelled towards population growth .
Trade - driven divergence
The expansion of international trade has enhanced the specialisation of industrial economies in the production of industrial , skilled intensive , goods .
The associated rise in the demand for skilled labour has induced a gradual investment in the quality of the population , expediting a demographic transition , stimulating technological progress and further enhancing the comparative advantage of these industrial economies in the production of skilled intensive goods .
In non-industrial economies , in contrast , international trade has generated an incentive to specialise in the production of unskilled intensive , non-industrial , goods .
The absence of significant demand for human capital has provided limited incentives to invest in the quality of the population and the gains from trade have been utilised primarily for a further increase in the size of the population , rather than the income of the existing population .
The demographic transition in these non-industrial economies has been significantly delayed , increasing further their relative abundance of unskilled labour , enhancing their comparative disadvantage in the production of skilled intensive goods and delaying their process of development .
This implies that international trade has persistently affected the distribution of population , skills , and technologies in the world economy , and has been a significant force behind the ` Great Divergence ' in income per capita across countries .
In contrast to the existing literature on the dynamics of comparative advantage , our theory suggests that even if trade equalises output growth in the trading countries , ( due to the terms of trade effect ) , income per capita of developed and less developed economies will diverge , since in developed economies the growth of total output will be generated primarily by an increase in output per capita , whereas in less developed economies the contribution of population growth to the growth of total output will be more significant .
Empirical evidence
In accordance with this theory , cross country regressions support the hypothesis that international trade generates opposing effects on fertility rates and human capital formation in developed and less developed economies .
We examine the effect of the share of trade in GDP in 1985 on total fertility rate and on the change in the average years of schooling in industrial and non-industrial economies over the time period 1985 - 2000 .
As shown in Figures 1 and 2 , a larger share of trade in GDP per capita has a positive effect on fertility rates and a negative effect on the average years of education in non-OECD economies , whereas in OECD economies , trade triggers a decline in fertility and an increase in education .
Thus , international trade accentuates the initial patterns of comparative advantage and is likely to affect differently the growth trajectory of population , human capital , and income per capita of developed and less developed economies .

Historical evidence also indicates that the fundamental hypothesis of this research is consistent with the process of development of the last two centuries .
It suggests that the asymmetric effect of international trade on the timing of the demographic transition in developed and less - developed economies , and its persistent effect , therefore , on the initial patterns of comparative advantage may be an important element behind the Great Divergence over the last two centuries .
In particular , the analysis is consistent with the diverging experience in terms of the levels of income per capita and population growth rates of the UK and India since the nineteenth century .
Industrialisation in India regressed over the 19th century whereas industrialisation in the UK accelerated .
The process of industrialisation in the UK led to a significant increase in the demand for skilled labour in the second phase of the industrial revolution , triggering a demographic transition and a transition to a state of sustained economic growth .
In India , in contrast , the lack of demand for skilled labour delayed the demographic transition and the process of development .
Thus , while the gains from trade were utilised in the UK primarily towards an increase in output per capita , in India they were more biased towards an increase in the size of the population .
Policy concerns
Thus , our research suggests that policy makers ought to consider the dynamic effects of international trade on factor endowments and therefore on the patterns of comparative advantage in the long run .
These effects may generate differential long - run growth trajectories in the currently developed and less developed economies .

Jay Villemarette cleans skeletons -- mostly animal and human skulls -- for a living .
He owns Skulls Unlimited International and insists there 's never a dull moment at the office .
We 'll take his word for it .
After all , his company might be cleaning a gorilla skull one day and that of a chipmunk , a giraffe or a human the next .
You probably wonder “ Why would anyone want a skull , no matter how clean it is ? "
But museums , veterinary and medical schools , and other educational groups might take umbrage with that assessment .
There are enough of these establishments , in fact , that Villemarette needs 13 full - time staffers and two part - timers and expects his company to break $ 2 million in sales this year .

MADRID ( Reuters ) -
There is more than a 50 percent chance the United States could go into recession , former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan told El Pais newspaper in an interview published on Sunday .

However , the U.S. has not yet entered recessionary state marked by sharp falls in orders , strong rises in unemployment and intensive weakening of the economy , he said .
“ We would have to see signs of this intensification : there are some , but not many yet , ” he said .
“ Therefore ... I would not describe the situation we are in as a recession , although the chances that we ’ll have one are more than 50 percent . ”
A sharp downturn in the U.S. housing market has led to a full - blown credit crisis that has reverberated throughout the U.S. financial system .
The economy has become increasingly important in the U.S. presidential campaign , topping the list of voters ’ concerns heading into the November election .
Greenspan , the U.S. Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006 , endorsed the Republican presidential candidate John McCain in the interview .
“ I ’m Republican and I support John McCain , who I know very well and who I respect a lot , ” he said .
The economies of the United States and the European Union were at a crossroads after a long period of economic growth without inflation , he said .
“ This period is going to be much more difficult , from the point of view of monetary policy , than the period during which I was chairman of the Federal Reserve , ” he said .
Turning to Europe , he pinpointed Spain as having a bigger real estate bubble than the United States , exposing it to the global credit squeeze .
“ The real estate bubble in Spain has been bigger than most other European countries , even bigger than the one in the United States , ” he said .
“ In that sense , one would have to presume that there is more vulnerability . ”
Spain has been the fastest - growing major European economy for more than a decade due to a housing boom during which house prices tripled , but the global credit crisis coupled with higher interest rates have put a sharp brake on growth .
He gave a broadly positive overview of other European economies .
Every parent wants their child to have the best in life .
But would this extend to picking the best genes for them ?
To date , genetic technology has only been used to treat serious disease in children .
But as ways are developed to manipulate our DNA , there are those who think that parents will inevitably want to choose their children 's genes , and create ' designer babies ' .
A designer baby today
Philippa Handyside 's son Ruiaridh is a genetically selected baby .
Some might call him a designer baby .
But Philippa was n't aiming to create a perfect child and there is nothing unusual about her child 's genes .
Genetic technology seemed the only way she could have a baby at all .
Philippa had a problem with her DNA .
It did n't affect her health , but it meant that most of her eggs did n't carry all the genes needed for a baby to grow healthily .
The result was that each time she became pregnant , she miscarried .
Doctors suggested that Philippa try a technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) .
Using PGD scientists can screen embryos outside the womb , long before they develop into babies .
They can select just those embryos that carry healthy genes .
This ensures the baby is free from genetic abnormalities .
Ruiaridh might have grown from a specially selected embryo , but he 's not really a designer baby at all .
The embryo was created from one of Philippa 's eggs and her husband 's sperm , just as in IVF .
His genes have not been altered , or enhanced in any way .
The doctors simply chose an embryo that did n't carry Philippa 's genetic disorder .
It would actually be very difficult to make a true designer baby using PGD .
Today , it can only be used to look at one or two genes at a time .
On the other hand , most character traits we might want to choose – anything from height to intelligence – are influenced by a whole range of genes .
What 's more , there is no way of altering the genes inside an embryo using PGD .
If you do n't carry the genes to be intelligent , sporty or good - looking , then there 's no way any of your embryos will either .
To have a real designer baby , we 'd need to be able to choose any genes we wanted and insert them into our children .
Inserting new genes
In 1998 Dr French Anderson put forward a radical proposal .
He thought he would soon be able to insert new genes into babies in the womb .
The idea was to treat genetic diseases caused by a single damaged gene by inserting a new , healthy gene into a foetus 's cells .
French Anderson had already used this technique – called gene therapy – in children with faulty white blood cells , with some success .
But the cells with healthy genes would eventually die , so the patients would have to have the procedure all over again .
French Anderson wanted to try gene therapy in the womb because then he could get the healthy genes into special blood cells called stem cells .
These cells grow all the blood cells in the body .
If the healthy gene could be injected into the stem cells , then the patient 's body would produce new white blood cells with healthy genes on its own .
In short , they would be cured .
But for all Anderson 's plans , this technique has never been used on human babies in the womb .
There turned out to be problems with gene therapy .
In 1999 an 18 - year - old died during a gene therapy trial , and there have been cases of children developing leukaemia after gene therapy treatment .
For now , using it on babies in the womb is far too risky .
A human clone : the ultimate designer baby
There is however potentially another way to insert genes into an embryo long before birth – cloning .
No scientific discovery has created as much hysteria as the cloning of Dolly the sheep .
She was the first mammal cloned from the DNA of an adult cell .
It was a process that brought human cloning one step closer .
Shortly after Dolly , Polly was born .
She was n't just a clone .
A human gene had been added early on in the cloning process .
She was a true , genetically modified , " designer sheep " .
Since Polly , there has been a flurry of claims that humans have been , or soon will be , cloned .
But no one has yet produced evidence that a human clone has been created .
Most serious scientists wo n't even consider the idea of cloning a human .
The procedure is not very effective .
Less than 10 per cent of non-human cloning attempts are successful .
And many of the pregnancies result in miscarriage or deformities .
It is a procedure that is simply too dangerous to use to produce a human baby .
But cloning technology is being used on human eggs .
Scientists from Newcastle University and the Newcastle Fertility Centre are using cloning to create stem cells .
The research has only just begun , but the ultimate aim is to create cloned stem cells from the DNA of a patient with a degenerative disease .
These cells could then be turned into whatever types of cells are needed to treat their damaged organs .
It could one day lead to cures for diabetes , Alzheimer 's or heart disease .
There will always be a risk that genetic technology will be hijacked to create designer children .
But for now , the technical difficulties make it unlikely anyone will be able to create a true designer baby in the near future .
